The new joint framework reiterates that urbanization is a transformative force that, if properly harnessed, can help countries and cities overcome major development challenges and make progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Und er the new partnership framework, the five key areas of focus will be to: support countries to develop National Urban Policies (NUPs); help national and local governments develop effective and innovative financing frameworks to deliver local development ag endas and ensure cities' vital role in national economies; strengthen countries' and cities' capacity to fulfil climate action commitments; help adopt integrated approaches to strengthen urban resilience and pursue innovative digital technologies for peopl e centered smart cities. The Executive Director of UN -Habitat Maimunah Mohd Sharif stated: The areas of focus within this collaboration respond to the 2030 Agenda, the Paris Agreement and the New Urban Agenda adopted in 2016, and the current need to supp ort countries and cities with their COVID -19 response and recovery. It will allow us to leverage our respective capacities as a contribution to the Decade of Action launched by the Secretary -General. UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner stated, Cities have b een on the frontline of the COVID -19 response. A green and inclusive recovery will not be viable without the direct engagement of cities. UN -Habitat and UNDP have enjoyed a longstanding partnership and now we have an opportunity to capitalize on each other 's strengths to move forward together in areas ranging from local economic development, to decentralized service delivery and supporting low -carbon resilient development. Currently UN -Habitat is implementing 20 projects funded through UNDP, valued at USD $80 million. The majority of these joint -projects are in the Arab States region (Iraq, Lebanon and Syria) and Africa (Somalia, South Sudan, Ethiopia and Mozambique). Two -thirds of these projects focus on reconstruction, resilience and/or urban planning. Th e others deal with access to land, local governance and development in line with the UN reform, the collaboration will be translated into yearly targets, led by the regional and country offices, aiming for concrete impact where it matters most. From https://www.undp.org/ 12/05/2020 TOP 1Government Policy and Legislation Sustainability and Resilience in Smart City Planning: A Review Urban planning is recognized as an interaction between the state and society, which aims to articulate public policies in the territory, facilitating their administration in favor of greater development and well -being of society. However, this interaction becomes complex because consumption demands increase, and the carrying capacity of the urban ecosystem to supply them is exceeded, hindering its sustainable functionality. With this overview, it becomes relevant to study urban planning from a sustainable environmental planning perspective, based on four topics: urban planning, sustainabi lity, resilience, and smart cities, which are developed throughout the document by means of a chronological study. A bibliometric study was used through a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta -Analyses (PRISMA) adjustment to 87 articles , supported by VOSviewer\u00ae, which allowed for the construction and visualization of the co-occurrence networks of key words extracted from the selected articles. Likewise, 16 documents more were used for the co -occurrence analysis. The main result is to consider cities with a complex systems approach that works like a gear; the relationship between inter -urban and intra -urban processes is the key factor that allows for an understanding of their synchronization; therefore, deepening of each of these topics is crucial to the ideal of a territorial administration involving time scales and adaptive cycles, allowing for the provision of new tools for concepts such as carrying capacity and the measurement of the ecological footprint From https://www.mdpi.com/ 12/28/2020 TOP CAREC Endorses Long -Term Strategy to Promote Safe, Sustainable, and Inclusive Tourism Ministers and senior officials from the 11 member countries of the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Program have endorsed a new long -term strategy to promote safe, sustainable, and inclusive tourism development in the region, and enhance its attractiveness as a competitive tourism destination globally. The CAREC Touri sm Strategy 2030, presented at the 19th CAREC Ministerial Conference held virtually today, was endorsed by ministers and senior officials representing Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, the People's Republic of China (PRC), Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan also attended the meeting. The CAREC region is home to a wide range of historical and cultural heritage sites; unique gastronomy and local traditi ons; a rich, unexplored network of cities; and arresting natural endowments that traverse national boundaries, said Asian Development Bank (ADB) Vice -President Shixin Chen, co-chair of the conference. Through the gradual implementation of regional initiatives, the CAREC Tourism Strategy 2030 will help the region bounce back from COVID -19 and establish itself as a sustainable, safe, and easily accessible tourism destination over the long term. In 2019, CAREC countries generated more than 420 million domestic tourists but only received 41 million foreign tourists. With the COVID -19 pandemic severely affecting global tourism in 2020, the CAREC Tourism Strategy 2030 accounts for the shift in travelers' preference towards closer, safer, and uncrowded dest inations while outlining a long -term plan to develop the region as an easily accessible tourism destination that provides visitors with a variety of unique experiences. The strategy provides a roadmap towards the enhancement of the region's connectivity th rough the harmonization of visa requirements and quality standards, simplification of border crossing procedures, and improvement of tourism infrastructure and facilities. It also focuses on tourism skills development while maximizing the use of digital technologies. It aims to build a common brand, Visit Silk Road, through the creation of a CAREC tourism web portal and joint promotional activities for tour operators and other business providers. It seeks to develop unique tourism products and experiences catering to various segments including business, culture, nature and adventure, sun and beach holidays, health and wellness, and domestic weekenders. By fostering sustainable tourism growth in rural and urban areas, the new strategy will also help to re duce regional imbalances and empower local communities, said ADB Director General for Central and West Asia Werner Liepach. It will promote gender equality by promoting jobs and income opportunities for private sector SMEs and entrepreneurs including wom en and young people. The CAREC Program is a partnership of 11 countries to promote economic growth and sustainable development through regional cooperation. It is supported by development partners including ADB, which serves as the Secretariat for the CAR EC Program. Since 2001, the CAREC Program has financed 208 regional infrastructure and trade projects worth $39.2 billion. Of this, $14.7 billion has been financed by ADB, $15.8 billion by other development partners, and $8.7 billion by CAREC member countr y governments. From https://www.adb.org/ 12/07/2020 TOP New CAREC Gender Strategy to Promote Women's Empowerment Ministers and senior officials from the 11 member countries of th e Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Program have endorsed a new strategy to promote women's empowerment by ensuring regional projects address women's needs and provide equal access to benefits and opportunities. The CAREC Gender Strategy 2 030, presented at the 19th CAREC Ministerial Conference held virtually today, was endorsed by ministers and senior officials representing Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, the People's Republic of China, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan also attended the meeting. There is a critical need for additional efforts to include women's voices at all stages of planning and implementation in regional project s, said Asian Development Bank (ADB) Vice-President Shixin Chen, co -chair of the conference. Gender equality is essential for sustainable development and the gender strategy promotes the empowerment of women by ensuring access to capacity building, econo mic opportunities, and involvement in decision making. CAREC countries face several common challenges to improving the lives of women. There is a systemic gender gap in labor force participation, with disparities in employment rates, pay scales, and quality of employment. There are also challenges in implementing national policies on flexible working arrangements, parental leave, and equal pay. In many countries, female entrepreneurship is undermined by a lack of finance for start -ups and expansion be cause of women's limited ownership of assets to leverage credit, while the proportion of women in senior management positions remains low. Women are also often among the most affected by external shocks such as drought or flooding linked to climate change; food and oil price fluctuations; and global pandemics because of their disproportionate exposure to risk and primary care responsibilities. CAREC's gender strategy outlines how the program's operations will supplement national strategies to empower women. This includes promoting economic opportunities for women in paid formal employment, in agriculture and informal sectors, and in entrepreneurship, among others. The strategy articulates how CAREC interventions will account for the specific needs and conce rns of women and girls through projects' consultative processes. It also aims to ensure women have equal access to quality education, health care services, and information and communication technology. ADB identifies gender equality as both a critical end goal and a key driver of sustainable socioeconomic development, said ADB Director General for Central and West Asia Werner Liepach. The gender strategy endorsed today is a step towards closing the gender equality gap that creates disadvantage, limits op portunities, and undermines well -being for women and other vulnerable groups in all CAREC countries, and will help to ensure that CAREC interventions leave no one behind. All CAREC countries have committed to the Sustainable Development Goals and to key i nternational gender equality agreements, including the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women. The CAREC gender strategy commits to support policy reforms that will address existing gender disparities. The CAREC Program is a partnership of 11 countries to promote economic growth and sustainable development through regional cooperation. It is supported by development partners including ADB, which serves as the secretariat for the CAREC Program. Since 2001, the CAREC Progra m has financed 208 regional infrastructure and trade projects worth $39.2 billion. Of this, $14.7 billion has been financed by ADB, $15.8 billion by other development partners, and $8.7 billion by CAREC member country governments. From https://www.adb.org/ 12/07/2020 TOP APEC Symposium to Focus on Reigniting Growth and Planning for Recovery This week, New Zealand, incoming host of the Asia -Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, will focus member economies on a collaborative approach to reigniting growth and setting a plan for recovery from the economic impacts of COVID -19. New Zealand's A PEC host year begins on Wednesday, 9 December, with representatives of the 21 member economies attending a symposium and the APEC Informal Senior Officials' Meeting hosted virtually from Wellington. Bringing APEC officials together provides an important o pportunity to set expectations and prioritize the work that will take place throughout the following APEC year, said Dr Rebecca Sta Maria, Executive Director of the APEC Secretariat. New Zealand will host APEC in the wake of the unprecedented health and economic crisis caused by COVID -19, she added. This means that much of the focus for the upcoming meeting will be on COVID -19 and supporting the region's economic response and recovery. APEC's Economic Leaders agreed to the 2020 Kuala Lumpur Declarati on last month and stand united in their determination to enable the Asia -Pacific region to successfully recover from the COVID -19 pandemic and its economic impacts. APEC Leaders also agreed to the APEC Putrajaya Vision 2040, a shared vision of the forum fo r the next 20 years. In the year ahead, APEC will not only be charting the course through the current economic crisis, but will also be agreeing a detailed plan of action to implement the new vision, Dr Sta Maria explained. This will also be an importan t task for the year and a core focus for New Zealand as host. There is no doubt that the immediate economic response to COVID -19 will dominate discussions in 2021, but as we work to rebuild, we also need to consider the policies that will sustain a resil ient recovery, said New Zealand's Minister for Trade and Export Growth, Damien O'Connor. Running from 9 -11 December, the APEC Informal Senior Officials' Meeting will include a symposium that will bring together global thinkers on issues important to APEC , an informal plenary meeting and an informal retreat. Symposium experts will discuss macro -economic and fiscal responses to COVID -19 highlighting the importance of structural reform, digital economy, inclusive and sustainable growth and trade. The strea m will feature keynote addresses from: Vangelis Vitalis, Chair of APEC's Senior Officials' Meeting Mari Pangestu, World Bank Managing Director of Development Policy and Partnerships Richard Baldwin, Professor of International Economics, G raduate Institute of International and Development Studies Ma Jun, Chairman, Green Finance Committee of China Society for Finance and Banking Denis Hew, Director, Director of the APEC Policy Support Unit. Keynote presentations from the symposium will b e streamed on the APEC 2021 website from 04:30PM New Zealand (GMT+12). The symposium precedes the APEC Informal Senior Officials' meeting and retreat on 10 -11 December. At this meeting, senior officials from across the region will elaborate on the policy a genda for 2021. No registration is required for media representatives who wish to cover the meeting.

From https://www.apec.org/ 12/08/2020 TOP East Asia CHINA: To Ensure Sustainability of Macro Policies China will ensure the continuity, stability, and sustainability of its macro policies and try to keep the economy running within a reasonable range, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said on Tuesday. That came as Li met Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), via video link in Beijing. Hailing the IMF's significant contribution to promoting free trade and facilitating global economic development, Li expressed the hope that the organization can continue to help forge multil ateral consensus and vowed China's due contribution in the process as the biggest developing country. On a briefing about China's current economic situation, Li said: \"We are confident that China's economy will register positive growth this year, which is not an easy task to accomplish for a country with a 1.4 billion population.\" He pointed out that while the global economy is heading towards recovery, the world still faces uncertainties. \"We will continue to promote economic and social development while keeping the COVID -19 pandemic under control, ensure the continuity, stability, and sustainability of macro policies, and try to keep the economy operating within a reasonable range,\" said Li. For her part, Georgieva said the IMF appreciated China's import ant role in trade, global economic recovery, poverty reduction, promoting low carbon growth, and other areas. She also expressed the IMF's readiness to enhance cooperation with China in upholding multilateralism and reviving global trade to strengthen the momentum of economic recovery globally. From http://www.new s.cn/ 12/08/2020 TOP China Adjusts Regulations to Implement Foreign Investment Law Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has signed a State Council decree announcing the decision on adjusting several administrative rules and regulations in order to step up the implementation of the Foreign Investment Law. According to the decree, 22 administrative regulations have been amended and one abolished. Certain clauses of these regulations were considered in incompatible with the Foreign Investment Law, which took effect on Jan. 1. For example, a set of regulations on the management of establishing partnership enterprises by foreign enterprise s or individuals in China were abolished, as the Foreign Investment Law, the Partnership Enterprise Law and other relevant laws and regulations are now applicable in this matter. The adjustment of regulations will take effect after the signing of the decre e. From http://www.new s.cn/ 12/11/2020 TOP China Releases Rules on Foreign Investment Security Review Chinese authorities on Saturday released rules on foreign investment security review to safeguard national security while spurring foreign investment. The rules, jointly released by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the Ministry of Commerce (MOC), specified provisions concerning the security review mechanism on foreign investment, including the types of investments subject to review, review scopes, and procedures, among others. Approved by the State Council, the 23 -clause rules aim to effectively forestall and resolve national security risks while actively pr omoting and protecting foreign investment to support the country's higher -level opening -up and facilitate the new development paradigm, said a statement released by the two government departments. Conducting security reviews on foreign investments that aff ect or may affect national security is a regular international practice. China adopted a related review mechanism in 2011, and the country's management system on foreign investment has undergone significant reforms over the past decade. The office of the working mechanism of the security review will be set up under the NDRC, which will lead the task along with the MOC, according to the statement. The rules will take effect 30 days after the release. An office official stressed that releasing the security r eview rules is not a protectionist move or refusal to further open up. Instead, it accords with China's commitment to opening -up on all fronts and aims at strengthening the security mechanism for opening -up. While encouraging and protecting foreign investm ent, the rules should prevent and dissolve national security risks and safeguard opening -up at a higher level, the official said. He added that opening -up without security protection is unsustainable in the long run. Meanwhile, the official said that the o ffice would cooperate with related authorities to promote and protect foreign investment under the Foreign Investment Law. While implementing the security review rules, it will step up efforts to advance institutional opening -up. The country will improve the \"pre -establishment national treatment plus negative list\" management system for foreign investment and be fair to both domestic and overseas companies in tax and fee cuts, licensing, and standard -setting, the official said. Also, efforts will continue to encourage foreign investment in advanced manufacturing, modern services, and environmental protection sectors and create a market -oriented, law -based, and internationalized business environment with high standards. Looking ahead, the official added that China would unswervingly follow the path of expanding opening -up, enhancing the business environment, and welcoming foreign investment. From http://www.new s.cn/ 12/19/2020 TOP China Adopts New Energy Security Strategy: White Paper China has adopted a new energy security strategy, vowing to promote reforms in energy supply and consumption, market building and innovation while strengthening international cooperation, according to a white paper released Monday. The strategy, featuring reform mainly in four aspects and comprehensive international cooperation, endeavors to adapt to domestic and international changes and meet new requirements, said the white paper titled \"Energy in Ch ina's New Era.\" REFORM TO IMPROVE ENERGY CONSUMPTION STRUCTURE One of the reforms under way is to improve the country's energy consumption structure by containing unnecessary consumption. To that end, China has tightened the control of total energy consump tion and energy use intensity, enforced energy conservation in all areas of social and economic development, and taken moves to adjust its industrial structure, promote energy conservation in the process of urbanization and develop a green and low-carbon t ransport system. REFORM TO DIVERSIFY ENERGY SUPPLY To optimize and diversify its energy supply structure, China has been vigorously promoting the clean and efficient utilization of fossil energy, prioritizing the development of renewable energy, developing nuclear power in a safe and orderly manner, and raising the proportion of non-fossil energy in the energy supply structure. Exploration and exploitation for oil and gas resources have also been enhanced. REFORM TO UPGRADE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES Chi na is implementing an innovation -driven development strategy, building a system that nurtures innovation in green energy technologies, and upgrading energy technologies and equipment in an all -round way. Basic research on energy, innovation in generic and disruptive technologies, and original and integrated innovation have been strengthened. China has also started to integrate digital, big -data and AI technologies with technologies for clean and efficient energy exploration and exploitation, with a focus on smart energy technologies, to foster new growth drivers for industrial upgrading. REFORM TO PROMOTE FASTER GROWTH OF ENERGY SECTOR China has been making efforts to form a unified and open market with orderly competition, advance energy pricing reform to create a mechanism in which the market determines the price. It also strives to streamline government administration through reform, strengthen planning and policy guidance for the energy sector, and improve the regulatory system of the energy industry. GLOBAL COOPERATION FOR ENERGY SECURITY IN OPEN ENVIRONMENT China has been advancing comprehensive cooperation with other countries to realize energy security in an open environment. Under the principle of equality and mutual benefit, China is opening its door wider to the world. The country promotes green and sustainable energy development under the Belt and Road Initiative, and endeavors to improve energy infrastructure connectivity. An active participant in global energy governance, China has been increasin g energy cooperation and exchanges with other countries, and facilitating international trade and investment in the energy sector. The country has also joined the international community in building a new model of energy cooperation, maintaining energy m arket stability, and safeguarding common energy security. GUIDING PHILOSOPHIES FOR POLICY MAKING The white paper also stated the guiding philosophies for China's energy policies in the new era, namely, putting people first, promoting the use of clean and l ow-carbon energy, ensuring the core status of innovation, pursuing development through reform and building a global community of shared future. \"Confronted by the severe impact of climate change, China advocates a global community of shared future, greater international cooperation on energy governance, and a new round of energy reform directed towards clean and low -carbon development,\" said the document. From http://www.new s.cn/ 12/21/2020 TOP China Gives Priority to Non -fossil Energy Development: White Paper China gives priority to non -fossil energy, and strives to substitute low -carbon for high-carbon energy and renewable for fossil energy, according to a white paper released Monday. The country has been facilitating the use of solar energy, developing wind power, hydropower as well as safe and structured nuclear power while advancing biomass, geothermal and ocean energy development in accordance with local conditions, said the white paper titled \"Energy in China's New Era\" released by the State Council Information Office. The country has been increasing the overall utilization rate of renewable energy, with the national average consumption rate of wind power reaching 96 percent , that of solar photovoltaic power hitting 98 percent, and that of water energy in major river basins reaching 96 percent in 2019, the document said. \"The development and utilization of non -fossil energy is a major element of transitioning to a low -carbon and eco -friendly energy system,\" it said. While prioritizing non -fossil energy, the country has also been promoting the clean and efficient development and utilization of fossil energy. Coal remains the basic energy source, the white paper said, adding th at the country's annual production of raw coal has ranged between 3.41 billion tonnes and 3.97 billion tonnes since 2012. The country has been facilitating the safe, smart and green utilization of coal. From 2016 to 2019, China cut more than 900 million to nnes of outdated coal production capacity per year on average. \"Green development of the energy sector has played an important role in reducing carbon emissions,\" the white paper said. By 2019, carbon emission intensity in China had decreased by 48.1 perce nt compared with 2005, which exceeded the target of reducing carbon emission intensity by 40 to 45 percent between 2005 and 2020, reversing the trend of rapid carbon dioxide emission growth, it said. From http://www.new s.cn/ 12/21/2020 TOP China Releases Guidelines for High -quality Development of Elder Care Services The State Council, China's cabinet, has unveiled guidelines for establishing and improving a comprehensive supervision system for elder care services to boost the sector's high -quality development. The guidelines, issued by the General Office of the State Council, urged further reform on government services and accelerated moves to build a unified elder care ma rket featuring efficiency and fair competition. Highlighting an improved business climate, the guidelines noted that incentives should be put in place to guide elder care facilities to run in accordance with business ethics and the law, and to keep improvi ng their services. Government supervision should mainly focus on buildings, fire prevention, food safety and medical services in elder care facilities, as well as related workforces and funding usage, among other aspects, according to the guidelines. Elder care facilities found to be defrauding or abusing seniors will face severe punishment, per the guidelines. From http://www.new s.cn/ 12/21/2020 TOP China to Revise Anti -monopoly Law, Formulate Law on Public Health Emergency Response China's top legislature is in 2021 expected to consider laws on public health emergency response, family education, stamp duty and futures, among others, said a spokesperson on Monday. The lawmakers w ill also deliberate revisions to the anti-monopoly law, as well as laws concerning issues such as the prevention and control of infectious diseases, the progress of science and technology, and education, said Yue Zhongming, spokesperson for the Legislative Affairs Commission of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee. The legislative work plan for next year has been approved in principle by the Council of Chairpersons of the NPC Standing Committee, said Yue. In 2020, the NPC and its Standing Committee have thus far enacted eight laws, revised nine, and adopted 10 decisions on legal issues and other major concerns. From http://www.new s.cn/ 12/21/2020 TOP China Considers Anti -Food-Waste Law to Ensure Food Security Chinese lawmakers on Tuesday began deliberating a draft law on preventing food waste to ensure food security. The 32 -article draft was submitted to the ongoing session of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for its first reading. The law is of great significance to promoting a healthy, rational, and green lifestyle and better consumption behavior. It is also essential to accelerating the construction of a resource -conserving and env ironmentally -friendly society. It will also aid sustainable economic and social development, according to the reasoning submitted to the session. \"CLEAR YOUR PLATE\" CAMPAIGN The issue of food waste has been of widespread concern in the country in recent years. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the government has been paying more attention to the issue, with policies issued and campaigns launched to curb food waste. A nationwide \"Clear Your Plate\" campaign is gaining steam ac ross the country, both online and offline. Anti -food-waste posters and slogans are on the walls of many restaurants, and schools and universities have also joined the efforts to fight food waste. Netizens share photos and videos of empty plates after finis hing their food on social media platforms, where fighting food waste is among the hottest topics. In order to establish a long -term mechanism to prevent food waste, lawmakers are now elevating the constructive policies and measures the country has adopted over the past years into the draft law. GOVERNMENT DUTIES The draft law specifies the responsibilities of the government concerning the fight against food waste. Governments at all levels should exercise leadership over preventing food waste, improve wor k mechanisms, set targets, and intensify supervision and management, according to the draft. Local governments above the county level should update the public on the developments in their anti -food-waste work every year and propose measures to step up the work, the draft reads. It added that they should support sci -tech research and development that will help conserve food. China will enforce tax policies that will facilitate the fight against food waste, according to the draft. The draft also stipulates th e responsibilities of several State Council departments, ranging from making an overall work plan to tightening management and supervision of the catering industry. DUTIES OF VARIOUS SECTORS The draft law also requires government agencies, state -owned ent erprises, and public institutions to toughen the management of banquets using public funds. Catering service providers should adopt measures to minimize food waste, such as improving the management systems for food purchasing, storage, and processing. They should put up posters to remind consumers to refrain from ordering excessive food, says the draft, adding that they can charge consumers for obviously wasting food. It calls on catering service providers to use technologies. Big data, for instance, would analyze the needs of consumers. It would lead to improved management of food purchases, transportation, and storage. Online food delivery platforms should also display noticeable reminders on their food-ordering pages, and travel agencies are responsible for guiding travelers in saving food. Individuals should serve or eat an appropriate amount of food at weddings, funerals, parties, and other events, as well as in daily life, according to the draft. Food and catering industry associations should formulat e anti -waste standards and rules for their members, the draft reads. Schools should educate their students on practicing thrift and opposing waste, it says. News media outlets are required to promote public awareness of preventing food waste, the draft say s, banning them from producing, broadcasting, or spreading programs or audio -video clips on binge eating. SUPERVISION, PUNISHMENT The draft specifies that governments at all levels and relevant departments should set up supervision and inspection mechanisms to combat food waste. It urges those who waste food to rectify their misdeeds. All units and individuals have the right to file complaints with administrative departments against food producers found to have wasted food, it adds. Catering servic e providers inducing or misleading consumers into ordering excessive food that leads to obvious waste will be warned by market regulators. Those who refuse to make rectifications will be fined, according to the draft. Radio stations, TV stations, and onlin e audio -video service providers who produce, release, or spread content advocating gluttony will also receive a fine if they refuse to make corrections or commit serious violations. Regulators can suspend or shut down their services, the draft says. A law on food security is also in the legislative work plan for the next year, and its drafting is underway. From http://www.new s.cn/ 12/22/2020 TOP China Mulls New Law on Graft Busters The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, China's top legislature, on Tuesday started deliberating a draft law on graft busters as part of efforts to deepen reform of the country's anti -corruption system. The draft \"supervisors\" law, under first reading at the legislature, is expected to standardize the selection and appointment of anti -graft personnel, in addition to their functions, duties, management and oversight. China in 2018 enacted the Supervision Law and established supervision com missions at national, provincial, prefectural and county levels to integrate anti -corruption functions and personnel that had previously been scattered in related judicial and administrative organs, as well as in the disciplinary watchdogs of the Communist Party of China (CPC). The commissions have the power to investigate conduct involving the abuse of public office and hand out administrative sanctions. They can hand over public sector employees to the prosecutors in the case of suspected job -related crimes. The draft has stipulated the CPC's leadership over the supervisor system. Specifying the requirements for supervisors to perform duties, the draft is expected to further define their jurisdiction and strengthen their self-discipline and external o versight, thus helping ensure that the supervisory power is properly exercised. In addition to general and supplementary provisions, the draft has seven chapters, including one on the appraisal policies and another that deals with how the supervisors shall be overseen and how they shall be punished if they abuse supervisory power. From http://www.new s.cn/ 12/22/2020 TOP China to Extend Direct -benefit Monetary Policy Tools to Anchor Market Expectations China will prolong the policies on inclusive loan repayment extension and the credit loan support program for smaller businesses, with a view to keep the main economic indicators within an appropriate range, maintain the continuity, st ability and sustainability of the policies, spur vitality of market players and anchor market expectations, the State Council executive meeting chaired by Premier Li Keqiang decided on Monday. Competent departments devised two monetary policy tools this year, in an effort to funnel intensified, direct support for the real economy and help tide businesses over difficulties. That is, the loan extension which encourages local banks (namely, urban and rural commercial banks and rural credit cooperatives) to provisionally defer smaller businesses' inclusive loan repayments with incentives in place, and the inclusive credit loans which provide local banks with concessional funding support. The implementation of the aforementioned policy tools combined have achieve d remarkable results, benefiting over 3.1 million smaller market entities, and playing a positive role in alleviating financial pressure on enterprises, ensuring market entities and securing employment. \"This year, China's economy is able to achieve posi tive growth. This is attributable to financial institutions' intensified support for micro, small and medium -sized enterprises,\" Li said. \"The Central Economic Work Conference has underlined that necessary support for economic recovery shall be sustained, with well -calibrated and more effective policy operations.\" Attendees at the Monday meeting agreed that the economy is steadily returning to normal, and required continued efforts to help address the pressing concerns facing enterprises regarding their pro duction and operation, and to ensure proper policy transition and adjustment. It was decided at the meeting that the provisional deferral policy for both principal repayment and interest payment on smaller businesses' inclusive loans will continue to be e xecuted in the first quarter next year, and loan repayment further extended within a proper time frame. Inclusive loans granted to micro and small businesses will be extended as much as possible in line with market principles and upon consultations between enterprises and banks. Incentives will be put in place for local banks that provide inclusive loans for micro and small enterprises with a deferred repayment period of no less than six months. The incentives will remain at 1 percent of the loan principa l. Those at the meeting also decided that the inclusive credit loan support program will be extended from the end of this year as appropriate. Concessional financial support at 40 percent of the loan principal will continue to be given to eligible local ba nks for their issuance of inclusive credit loans to micro and small enterprises. \"Implementation and appropriate extension of the above -mentioned direct -benefit monetary policy tools will help small and micro enterprises better respond to changes at home a nd abroad and realize stable recovery of production and operation,\" Li said. From http://www.new s.cn/ 12/22/2020 TOP Chinese Lawmakers Call for Measures Against Unfair Online Competition Chinese lawmakers have called for exploring new ways to supervise and manage online behaviors violating the Anti -Unfair Competition Law. A report on the topic was submitted by the law enforcement inspection team of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) Wednesday to the ongoing session of the NPC Standing Committee for deliberation. Online behaviors breaching the Anti -Unfair Competition Law keep cropping up, including price discrimination, click farms, paid post deleti on, and false advertising via livestreaming, the report says. The report calls for measures to guide online platforms in tightening compliance and ethical reviews. It also suggests adopting new supervision and management methods to deal with behaviors of u nfair competition, calling for the use of technologies like big data to enhance analysis of such violations. From http://www.new s.cn/ 12/23/2020 TOP Chinese Premier Stresses Formulating Five -year Plan to Deepen Reform, Opening -up Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has stressed adopting a practical approach in formulating the 14th Five -Year Plan (2021 -2025) for National Economic and Social Development that takes into account the current and long -term situation and will promote the deepening of reform and opening -up. Li, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, made the remarks Wednesday at a meeting of the State Council's leading group on the five -year plan's draft formulation. Vice Premier Han Zheng, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, attended the meeting. Li urged efforts to formulate a plan t hat can stand the test of practice and history. Noting that the draft plan should be formulated on the basis of thorough consideration of development in the next five years and mesh with the long -range objectives through the year 2035, Li said it should contain overall plans and arrangements for the next two years when China will move to restore normal economic growth to lay a solid foundation for future development. Li also stressed properly setting development targets for the plan period, which need to be encouraging and leave some leeway at the same time. The premier said the draft plan should put forward more measures to advance institutional opening -up, improve the environment for foreign trade and investment, and enhance international exchange and co operation. From http://www.new s.cn/ 12/24/2020 TOP China to Stabilize, Optimize Industrial and Supply Chains in 2021: MIIT China will pool its strength to stabilize and optimize the industrial and supply chains next year, according to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT). More efforts will be made to monitor and evaluate the safety of key industrial and supply chains, strengthen the supply chains in the manuf acturing industry and tackle weak links, said Xiao Yaqing, minister of the MIIT at a working conference held from Monday to Tuesday in Beijing. He called for achieving breakthroughs in core technologies, speeding up the digital transformation of the manufa cturing sector and enhancing the flexibility and resilience of the industrial and supply chains. The country will make efforts to build more independent and controllable industrial and supply chains, as the security and stability of these chains is the fou ndation of forming a new development paradigm, according to the meeting. From http://www.new s.cn/ 12/29/2020 TOP Yearender -Economic Watch: China Expected to Fine -tune Monetary Policy to Boost Recovery China is expected to fine -tune its monetary policy next year to achieve the dual tasks of boosting economic recovery and forestalling financial risks, analysts said. China will keep its macroeconomic policies consistent, stable an d sustainable in 2021, with a prudent monetary policy that is flexible, precise, reasonable and moderate, according to the tone -setting Central Economic Work Conference that took place in December. \"We should strive to implement targeted and effective poli cies, make no sharp turns and pay attention to the ideal timing, extent, and impact of policies,\" the meeting said. China's macroeconomic policies are expected to be \"normalized\" next year after credit expansion this year to support the virus -hit economy, but the tightening bias is likely to come in a step -by-step manner, said Wang Qing, an analyst with Golden Credit Rating International. \"It's unlikely that we will see a sudden shift in policy direction. The meeting suggested that no 'policy cliff' would occur,\" Wang said. Instead of adopting a deluge of strong stimulus policies amid disruption due to the COVID -19 pandemic, China has implemented a prudent monetary policy in a flexible and appropriate manner to minimize the pandemic's impact and offered liq uidity to those that suffered the most. Special temporary monetary policy tools have been used in response to COVID -19, said Guo Kai, an official with the People's Bank of China (PBOC), giving examples of reloans supporting the production of medical suppli es and deferred repayment of inclusive loans. Targeted support was given to micro and small enterprises, which were hit hard by the pandemic. Outstanding inclusive loans to small and micro firms soared 29.6 percent by the end of September, hitting a new hi gh in the past seven months, data by the PBOC showed. As traditional counter -cyclical adjustments, the central bank also cut benchmark lending rates to counter downward economic pressure. The loan prime rates were cut twice this year, in February and April, when businesses were in dire need of cash to reopen. The rates have remained unchanged since May. The rather restrained policy stimulus has left the country room to prevent a rapid decline in credit growth next year, which could lead to bond default s and other financial risks, according to Lu Ting, chief China economist with Nomura. He expected the country's credit expansion rate to go down slightly next year if the pandemic starts waning globally. \"The chance that a systemic financial crisis would o ccur in China is very low thanks to sound economic fundamentals and enough policy space for the government to counter risks,\" he said. In a meeting held after the recent Central Economic Work Conference, the central bank vowed to keep the country's macro leverage at a stable level while walking a fine line between boosting economic recovery and preventing risks. It also pledged further support for private and small firms, while stepping up credit expansion in fields including technological innovation, gree n development and manufacturing. In the next year, the central bank will continue to maintain ample liquidity in the market via a variety of policy tools, but across -the-board cuts in interest rates or reserve requirement ratio are unlikely, said Tang Jian wei, an analyst with the Bank of Communications. From http://www.new s.cn/ 12/30/2020 TOP JAPAN: Enact ing Law to Make Coronavirus Vaccines Free to Residents The Diet enacted a law Wednesday to cover the costs for residents to be vaccinated against the coronavirus, as hopes grow for the early arrival of vaccines following recent reports of progress amid a resurgence of infections. The House of Councillors unani mously passed a bill to revise the current vaccination law after Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga pledged to secure coronavirus vaccines for all the roughly 126 million residents of the country in the first half of next year. Japan has agreed with U.S. pharma ceutical giant Pfizer Inc, American firm Moderna Inc and Britain's AstraZeneca Plc to receive sufficient vaccines for 145 million people when they are successfully developed, earmarking a budget of 671.4 billion yen ($6.4 billion) for that purpose. In the accelerating global race to develop vaccines to tackle the pandemic, Pfizer and its German development partner BioNTech SE have recently applied for approval in the European Union after doing so in the United States and Britain. The revised law does not cl arify whether the scheme will include foreign residents of Japan, but health ministry officials have said they expect them to be covered. The government needs to collect information on the efficacy and safety of vaccines under development as some of them employ artificial genes and other technologies that have yet to be used outside of a laboratory setting. The passage of the bill by the upper house of the Diet comes as Tokyo and many other parts of Japan are seeing a spike in infections, with the nation reporting a record 41 deaths on Tuesday. Tokyo on Wednesday confirmed 500 new cases of infection, the highest number since Saturday, when it logged 561. Although the revised law strongly recommends that people get inoculated, the government will allow indi viduals to refuse if the efficacy and safety of vaccines has not been proved sufficiently at the time of approval. In the event that vaccination causes serious side effects, the revised law states the government will cover medical expenses and disability p ensions as part of relief measures and shoulder damages on behalf of the vaccine suppliers. Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato, the top government spokesman, told a news conference, \"We will make efforts to establish a system to smoothly administer vac cines by closely collaborating with local governments and medical workers.\" Municipalities will be in charge of the administrative work related to vaccinations, which will be funded by the state. The Diet also passed a separate bill enabling the governme nt to continue beyond February the quarantining of people who test positive for the novel coronavirus upon their arrival in Japan, extending the measure that was due to expire after a year. In February, Japan decided to hospitalize people who test positive for the virus at airports and ports, and to require those suspected of infection to stay in designated facilities for a certain period. On Wednesday, the government also began re -evaluating the operation of its Go To Eat subsidy program to encourage dinin g out and is considering halting issuance of coupons under the initiative. Of Japan's 47 prefectures, 10 including Tokyo, Hokkaido and Osaka have already paused issuance of the coupons, which are offered with 25 percent premiums, due to a rise in coronavir us cases in their regions. Japan will strengthen financial support for dining establishments affected by a drop in demand due to the halting of coupon issuance. The plans will be included in the third supplementary budget for fiscal 2020. From https://japantoday.com 12/02/2020 TOP Suga Positions Carbon Goal, Digitization as Pillars for Economic Revitalization Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga pledged to work on measures to combat gl obal warming and digitization as the central pillars of economic revitalization efforts at a press conference on Friday ahead of the end of the extraordinary Diet session. With the coronavirus pandemic not yet under control, Suga apparently aims to revital ize the economy with signature policies, ahead of a dissolution of the House of Representatives for a general election. What our nation needs are sources of growth for the post -coronavirus era. Green [initiatives] and digital policies are key, Suga said at the press conference. He expressed a commitment to realizing the development of large -scale hydrogen production equipment, low -cost storage batteries and 6G, the successor to the high -speed, large -capacity 5G telecommunications standard. Concerning a di gital agency to be established as the headquarters for digitization, Suga expressed his intention to appoint about 100 experts from the private sector, saying that he would create a model for personnel who can advance their careers while moving back and fo rth between the public and private sectors. Since the start of the Suga Cabinet in September, the prime minister has attached importance to promoting the resumption of economic activities while taking measures against the coronavirus. However, experts of a government subcommittee on coronavirus measures have been increasingly cautious about the Go To Travel tourism promotion campaign amid a spike of infections in winter. Nevertheless, Suga has told his aides that the campaign should be promoted resolutely. He plans to propose an extension to the government's additional economic measures to deal with the coronavirus to the end of June next year. He mentioned the significance of the campaign during the press conference, saying: There are about nine million people involved in the tourist industry in Japan. The government has made decisions based on what will be most useful for regional economies. The prime minister is also focusing on environmental measures and the digitization of public administration as pa rt of long -term steps to strengthen the economy. He probably believes that it would be easy for the administration to achieve results in fields concerning the environment and digitization, unexplored areas that were not prioritized by the administration of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Suga's leadership within the administration is expected to be tested by an increase in out-of-pocket medical expenses for people aged 75 years and older, one of the major issues in the reform of social security for all generations that will review the structure of burdens and benefits for elderly people and working generations. Suga said to his aides that unless this issue is resolved, the reform cannot be said to be a reform for all generations in the true sense. At t he press conference, Suga said, It's important to decrease the burdens of younger generations as much as possible. However, Liberal Democratic Party coalition partner Komeito is cautious about expanding the target of those whose out -of-pocket expenses would increase, because of concerns about the impact it would have on the general election, which will take place in autumn next year at the latest. A meeting to discuss a draft for the reform was abruptly canceled just before it was to start on Friday as the coalition parties could not reach a consensus on the issue. The future handling of the government will depend on whether Komeito gets its way or the prime minister stands firm, an LDP member with ministerial experience said. The decision to dissolve the lower house for a general election will be a focal point for the future management of the government. Asked about the timing of the dissolution at the press conference, Suga indicated that economic revitalization and measures to prevent the spread of t he coronavirus are the main priorities. I'd like to devote all my efforts to these issues for the time being, he said. I will think it over carefully, he added, with an eye seemingly on the expiration of the term of lower house lawmakers in October ne xt year. Suga has been cautious about dissolving the lower house early next year, but reportedly is considering the idea as one of his options. Many within the LDP have called for an early dissolution while the Cabinet's approval rating remains strong. But , in addition to the sudden increase in coronavirus cases, scandals on money and politics involving former Prime Minister Abe and former agriculture minister Takamori Yoshikawa have come to light, dampening the momentum. The government plans to convene the ordinary Diet session on Jan. 18 and submit proposals for a third supplementary budget for fiscal 2020 and a fiscal 2021 budget. The prime minister intends to focus on realizing the early passage of budget plans and implementing a series of measures. For that reason, the lower house is more likely to be dissolved in spring or later after the passage of the fiscal 2021 budget, or after the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics scheduled for next summer. Key policies of the Suga Cabinet have begun to produce results. Regarding the lowering of mobile phone fees, NTT Docomo Inc. unveiled Thursday the lowest -price large -capacity mobile plan in the industry. Meanwhile, preparations are underway for a digital agency, which is expected to be launched in September ne xt year. A mid -ranking LDP lawmaker said that if dissolution is delayed, there could be a dissolution immediately before the expiration of the term of lawmakers, which tends to work against ruling parties. However, achieving tangible results ahead of a gen eral election appears to be Suga's basic strategy. He is expected to determine the timing of the dissolution, taking into consideration the infection situation and other factors. From https://the -japan -news.com 12/05/2020 TOP Japan Unveils Green Growth Plan for 2050 Carbon Neutral Goal Japan on Friday unveiled plans to boost renewable energy, phase out gasoline -powered cars and reduce battery costs as part of a bid to reach an ambitious 2050 carbon -neutral goal. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga announced the new 2050 goal in November, significantly moving up Japan's timeline for carbon -neutrality. On Friday, his government laid out for the first time what meeting that target wil l involve, including setting a provisional goal of generating more than half of the country's electricity from renewable sources by 2050. \"The government's actions on the environment reflect our belief that a significant change of mindset is required and t hat these are not constraints for growth, rather they are drivers of growth,\" top government spokesman Katsunobu Kato told a regular briefing. Japan, which is a signatory to the Paris climate deal, has been seen as reluctant to reduce its reliance on fossi l fuel, despite its self -professed pride as a nation of energy -saving technologies. The country was the sixth -biggest contributor to global greenhouse emissions in 2017, according to the International Energy Agency. The world's third largest economy still relies heavily on coal and liquefied natural gas, with most of its nuclear reactors offline since the 2011 Fukushima disaster. Japan expects demand for electricity to surge 30 -50 percent by 2050, but the nation's conservative ruling party has so far staye d lukewarm about renewable energy, though Suga has shifted the tone in recent weeks. Under the plans to boost renewables, officials are placing a new focus on offshore wind generation, with the goal of producing up to 45 gigawatts within the coming decades . Japan also wants to use nuclear and thermal power plants with carbon capture technology to cover 30 -40 percent of the nation's electricity demand. Ammonia and hydrogen technologies are expected to fulfill about 10 percent of the nation's power needs. By the mid -2030s, the government also wants to end the sale of new passenger vehicles that are solely powered by gasoline. Japan plans to replace them with hybrids, electric cars and cars fitted with fuel -cell engines, while bringing down the cost of batteri es for those vehicles. But while officials say the new plan is ambitious, some critics believe it falls short. Mika Ohbayashi, director of the Renewable Energy Institute, said the figures were \"a poor starting point for discussions and (showed) a lack of a mbition.\" Japan should aim for renewable energy to cover 50 -60 percent of national electricity needs by 2030, rather than wait until 2050, the think tank said. The institution also voiced its skepticism about whether carbon capture technology will become w idely available in the coming decades -- an assumption made by Japan as well as other nations in their carbon -neutral plans. From https://japantoday.com 12/26/2020 TOP Law Against Discrimination of Disabled to Be Applied More Broadly in Japan The government plans to amend an anti -discrimination law to require that private companies and stores give reasonable consideration to people with disabilities. The amendment to the Law on Eliminating Discrimination against Persons with Disabilities will make it mandatory for the private sector to remove obstacles such people face in social activities without being an excessive burden on private enterprise. The government is preparing to submit the amendment to the Diet session scheduled to convene in January. With an eye on the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics next year, the goal is to create an inclusive society with mutual respect for people of all abilities. The law was based on the U.N. Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and came into effect in April 2016. It prohibits the central government, municipalities and private businesses from discriminating on the basis of physical or mental ability. The law requires the c entral government and municipalities to give reasonable consideration to the disabled, while the private sector is called upon only to make an effort to undertake voluntary initiatives. The U.N. convention views not giving proper consideration to differe ntly abled people as a type of discrimination. By mandating that private companies give reasonable consideration, the revised law would equalize regulations for the public and private sectors. There are no penalties for violations of consideration. The gov ernment may provide advice, guidance or recommendations if improvements are not realized. Reasonable consideration refers to the act of removing barriers people with disabilities face regarding movement and communication, but only to the extent that costs and other burdens are not excessive. Such measures could include installing ramps on stairways for wheelchair users, and using sign language interpretation, illustrations, photos, tablets and other tools for the hearing impaired. In a 2017 poll conducted b y the Cabinet Office, 21.9% of the general public said they knew of the law, while 77.2% said they did not. The government hopes to raise awareness of discrimination against people with disabilities and strengthen efforts to achieve a more inclusive societ y by amending the law.

The project will provide support to SMEs and help those converted from business households play a part in sectoral links and supply chains. It aims to acce lerate public administrative reforms and delivery of Level 3 and Level 4 public administrative services, to improve the city's Provincial Competitiveness Index (PCI), and to achieve an average annual growth of 10 per cent and record about 30,000 newly -established enterprises annually. The project also sets for the local SMEs to create 1.5 million new jobs and to make up more than 25 per cent of H\u00e0 N i's total exports, more than 40 per cent of the city's gross regional domestic product (GRDP) and 30 per cent of the local budget. It is expected to benefit at least 500 SMEs in manufacturing and processing in the areas of information technology, electronics, mechanics, high -tech, food and agricultural preservation and processing. To do the work, the city will ne ed more than VN957 billion (US$41.3 million), including about VN832 billion to be funded by the city's budget. According to a report from the H\u00e0 N i People's Committee, the capital city is estimated to rake in about $4 billion in foreign direct investme nt (FDI) and VN145 trillion in domestic investment this year. It has more than 26,000 new businesses this year, accounting for 20 per cent of the country's total and raising the number of local firms to around 303,000. On the same day, the meeting elected Nguy n Ng c Tun as the chairman of the H\u00e0 N i People's Council for the 2021 -26 term and five vice chairs of the H\u00e0 N i People's Committee. The H\u00e0 N i People's Council wrapped up its three -day 18th meeting on Wednesday during which it adopted 20 reports a nd 16 resolutions, laying a basis for the city to mobilise resources for socio -economic development in 2021 and beyond.

From https://vietnamnews.vn 12/10/2020 TOP Ministry Proposes Special Policies for La rge SOEs to Make Them Spearheads The Ministry of Planning and Investment has proposed special policies for large State -owned enterprises (SOEs) to make them spearheads in key industries of the economy. The policies were mentioned in a first ever draft pro ject about developing large SOEs which aimed to promote the roles of selected SOEs in driving economic growth. Three industries would be piloted first, including telecommunications, energy and defence. Accordingly, three SOEs proposed to be selected for th e pilot implementation were Mobifone, EVN and Viettel. The ministry said telecommunications, energy and defence were important industries to the development and security of a country, which would supply indispensable inputs for production and business, pro vide infrastructure for digital transformation and Industry 4.0 as well as ensuring national defence. Mobifone was proposed for the telecommunications industry because it had a good financial situation and business results among three telecommunications co mpanies, according to the ministry. In addition, Mobifone had good technology and corporate governance system which were inherrited from the previous cooperation with Sweden's Kinnevik/Comvik Group. Mobifone was also focusing heavily on digital transform ation and developing an ecosystem for digital transformation for private companies. In the energy industry, Vit Nam Electricity (EVN) was proposed because EVN accounted for nearly 50 per cent of the country's total electricity output together with experie nces in investing in power sectors, especially clean energy. Viettel was proposed for the defence industry because it was taking the lead in research and development, manufacturing, technology transfer, import and export of military technical equipment and dual-use items. At the same time, Viettel with the focus on high -tech defence, electronics and telecommunications and network securities industries set the target to become one among the top 80 enterprise with the highest revenue from defence activities i n the world by 2025. Selected SOEs would play roles in paving the way and leading other enterprises in the formation and expansion of supply and value chains regionally and globally, the ministry said. The ministry also proposed solutions for Mobifone, EVN and Viettel to make them spearheads. Accordingly, the privatisation of Mobifone would be sped up so the State would hold a stake of 51 per cent of its charter capital after privatisation. The privatisation of Mobifone was proposed to be carried out before VNPT's. In addition, no foreign strategic investor would be selected for Mobifone's privatisation. EVN would be encouraged to play the key role in investing in renewable energy projects. For Viettel, a defence industry development fund would be founded, sourced from the group's after-tax prof it, together with a venture capital fund to promote the commercialisation of new products. Under the draft project, the ministry proposed five criteria to identify spearhead SOEs, including charter capital from VN1.8 trillion or higher, dominant market sh are (from 30 per cent), good governance system, operating in key sectors such as infrastructure, industry, energy, telecommunications and finance and banking and State -wholly owned or State holding the controlling stakes. Accordingly, a total of 17 economi c groups and corporations were proposed to be selected following these criteria. The ministry said that the operation efficiency of these 17 SOEs was not commensurate with the resources on hand. Statistics showed that these 17 SOEs had assets worth VN2.56 quadrillion in 2019. From https://vietnamnews.vn 12/15/2020 TOP HCM City Announces Guidelines for Issuing Apartment Ownership Certificates HCM City authorities have issued guidelines to speed up the issuance of land use and home ownership certificates to buyers to prevent disputes with housing developers. They divide apartment projects in the city into two categories for collecting land use fees for issuance of ownership cer tificates. For apartments with a compound, the entire project area is identified as residential land' and subject to fees for issuance of certificates for land use rights, house ownership and other land-related assets. For those without compounds that com e with public areas such as parks, schools, hospitals, and main roads connecting to public roads outside the apartment building, only the area of land used for apartment construction is considered residential land.' For the public areas, the city will organise bids to select investors. The construction of technical works such as electricity and water supply, drainage, lighting, telecommunications systems must be done by the developer and handed over to the city. No land -use fees will be collected. The Department of Natural Resources and Environment has been assigned to work with the departments of planning and architecture, construction, and other agencies to classify land areas in each project (both already completed and upcoming) subject to fees for is suance of ownership certificates. The Department of Construction will be responsible for monitoring compliance with construction norms and penalising violators. A number of apartments have been built in violation of approved plans and designs in HCM and H \u00e0 Ni, delaying the issuance of land use and home ownership certificates, according to city authorities. Many developers have even mortgaged their buildings to get loans for other projects, meaning buyers have been unable to get ownership certificates, acc ording to the Department of Construction. V\u00f5 Vn Hoan, vice chairman of the People's Committee, said the city would continue to review apartment projects in the city and work out solutions for delays in the issuance of ownership certificates. He urged agen cies to carefully review investors' financial capacity before licensing their projects. Investors found to have committed violations must be severely sanctioned, he added. The lack of certificates means apartment buyers cannot mortgage their property or us e it as collateral for bank loans or complete inheritance procedures. This often causes them to sell their apartments at below their real value. Experts said legal provisions related to investment, construction and land use are riddled with inconsistencies . HCM City and H\u00e0 N i have seen a rising number of disputes between buyers and apartment developers in recent years, especially with relation to construction progress, services fees, maintenance fees, construction quality, the use of common areas, ownershi p certificates, and appointment of building managers. The Government has ordered the cities to resolve the disputes. From https://vietnamnews.vn 12/17/2020 TOP HCM City Drafts 10-Year Climate Change Response Plan HCM City has drafted a long -term plan to combat the detrimental effects of climate change. The HCM City Department of Natural Resources and Environment recently held a seminar on climate change response policies 2017 -2020 and the new draft plan for the 2021 -2030 period. Experts praised authorities' efforts on reducing the amount of CO2 by one tonne between 2017 and 2019. According to a representative of the city's Department of Natural Resources and Environment, Nguy n Th Phng Tho, previous plans were relatively ambitious. They cost a significant amount of capital resources but did not generate successful results. While it is essential to make a plan based on the government's vision, HCM City needs to evaluate the quality of its human and infrastructure resources and get an update on global climate change activities before drafting a specific plan, she said. The deputy head of Scientific Management under the city's Department of Natural Resources and Environment, Hu nh Lu Tr\u00f9ng Ph\u00f9ng, said he was concerned that since the 10-year plan's mission is relatively broad, it would be challenging to determine detailed goals and products that meet society's actual needs. This occurred in a case in which authorities were once asked to research the impact of climate change on the agricultural sector. As the mission given was too broad to be carried out, they had a difficult time, Ph\u00f9 ng said, stressing the importance of setting realistic goals. Collaboration Speaking at the event, a representative of the HCM City's Department of Construction said the department would strive to complete the seven missions given by the city People's Committee in accordance with the Paris Agreement on climate change. The departme nt will collaborate with the World Bank and Asian Development Bank to offer solutions on management of flooding in HCM City. According to the deputy director of the HCM City Department of Natural Resources and Environment, Nguy n Th Thanh M , collaboratio n among authorities are important to tackle the impact of climate change. Though authorities have become more aware of the matter over the past few years, they have not considered a response to climate change as an essential task, she said. HCM City is cur rently working on a specific climate change response plan to be carried out between 2021 and 2030, with a vision to 2050. The HCM City Department of Natural Resources and Environment was appointed to take the leading role in this task, M said, suggesting that authorities need to be more active. Setting specific goals every three to five years, together with evaluation criteria, is required as well.

From https://en.trend.az/ 12/07/2020 TOP Oceania AUSTRALIA : To Drop Kyoto Credits Plan Environmentalists are calling for a reset of the federal government's climate policy in response to a report it will no longer use Kyoto carryover credits to meet emissions reductions targets. Prime Minister Scott Morrison plans to tell world leaders next week Australia will not use the controversial accounting method to satisfy its 2030 target under the Paris Agreement, Nine newspapers say. Greenpeace reponded to the news on Saturday by calling for a fresh climate policy. Spokeswoman Nelli Stevenson said the government had been stalling on climate action and \"dodgy accounting\" had led to Australia being shamed on the world stage. The government had been criticised for the car ryover plan, which involved using \"surplus\" units from the past 12 years and putting them towards the next decade of Paris targets. \"Australia needs a strong, federal climate policy, not a federal government kicking back on the heavy lifting being done by states, territories and businesses who are getting on with the job of moving to safe and reliable 100 per cent renewable energy,\" Ms Stevenson said in a statement. It was critical that Australia develop a meaningful policy to protect against worsening bus hfires, heatwaves and droughts, she said. \"It's time to walk the talk and ramp up ambition beyond Australia's weak Paris targets.\" Opposition leader Anthony Albanese called the development \"rather pathetic\" and said the government did not have a good enoug h short term or long term plan to tackle climate change. Mr Albanese suggested the decision to refrain from using the carryover credits should not be viewed as \"a positive\". \"It is a fact that the rest of the world rejected that as an accounting trick. Tha t's not a plus for the government,\" Mr Albanese said in Brisbane on Saturday morning. \"What we need is a plan to reduce emissions, not a plan for accounting tricks.\" Attorney -General Christian Porter said it had always been the government's position that \"essentially we are trying everything we can and using every technology available to meet our Paris targets without having to rely on the fact that we overperform with respect to our Kyoto targets\". He said the Paris targets were a \"floor, not a ceiling\" a nd the government's ambition was to do as well as possible. The change is set to be announced at a summit convened by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on December 12. From https://au.news.yahoo.com 12/05/2020 TOP New Law Would Allow Merged Unions to Split The government will introduce a law to make it easier for parts of an amalgamated union to disaffiliate, in a move targeting the troubled CFMEU. Speaking to reporters in Brisbane on Saturday, Attorney -General and Industrial Relations Minister Christian Porter said the announcement was meant to help \"good, hard -working members of unions (who) get stuck inside a union that may not be working in their best interest\". \"We ha ve seen some terrible behaviour from parts of the CFMEU yet there are other parts of the CFMEU who work hard on behalf of their members and would appear they want to leave that union and they should be given that opportunity,\" he said. Industrial relations law currently prevents one part of a registered organisation leaving five years after merging. The government's bill, to be introduced next week, would allow the Fair Work Commission to approve a vote for a de -merger after that period, if it considers it is appropriate based on specified considerations. Mr Porter said this would allow dissatisfied divisions of the CFMEU to apply for a ballot for their members to decide whether to break away and then take their members with them to form their own, standalo ne union. The Fair Work Commission would have to consider whether the merged organisation has a record of not meeting workplace laws or of not meeting standards for registered organisations. It would also have to look at the ability of the new organisation to protect its members' economic and social interests. Victorian CFMEU secretary John Sekta was expelled from the Labor party in 2019 over alleged comments about family violence campaigner Rosie Batty. Last year, he was also found guilty of using a carria ge service to harrass his wife. The government also plans to introduce a new omnibus industrial relations law next week. Mr Porter said on Saturday the bill would address issues like allowing an employer to offer an employee extra hours at ordinary wage rates. Currently, the employer must offer a higher wage or not offer the extra hours. From https://au.news.yahoo.com 12/05/2020 TOP Labor Deputy Whacks Foreign Relations Laws Labor has taken aim at \"half -baked\" foreign relations laws on the verge of passing federal parliament. Deputy Opposition Leader Richard Marles said the party agreed with giving the Commonwealth veto powers on deals struck between states or universities a nd foreign powers. \"But this specific piece of legislation is half -baked,\" Mr Marles told reporters in Canberra on Monday. \"It was rushed out the door in order to try and change the conversation on a day the government was under scrutiny in respect of aged care. \"It's simply not ready, the consultation hasn't been done with a whole lot of entities concerned, particularly the university sector.\" Mr Marles said Labor wanted to sit down with the government to discuss the legislation, which is destined to becom e law within days. \"We would really like for Marise Payne and the government to actually come out of the bunker and have a conversation with us about how we can do this in a better way,\" he said. Once the powers are passed, states and territories will be given three months to provide details of existing agreements with foreign governments. The federal government is then expected to tear up a deal the Victorian government has done with China. Defence Minister Linda Reynolds ducked questions about the contro versial Belt and Road agreement. \"That is not an issue for me as defence minister,\" she told reporters at Parliament House. \"That is something for the foreign minister and also the prime minister to answer.\" Trade and Tourism Minister Simon Birmingham said the Commonwealth would go through a careful and considered process in assessing more than 130 agreements. \"It wouldn't exactly be methodically going through things in good faith if I was to say that there was an automatic predisposition to tear it up,\" he told the ABC when asked about the China deal. \"We will go through the proper processes, not just for this agreement, but the majority of agreements that exist between the states and territories and foreign governments.\" Senator Birmingham said the vast m ajority of deals in questions were with governments other than China. \"We'll look at them all at face value and assess them against our foreign policy fairly, squarely and without any predetermined outcomes,\" he said.

From https://au.news.yahoo.com 12/07/2020 TOP Labor Plan for 10 Days Paid Violence Leave Workers affected by family violence would get 10 days of paid leave a year under a plan developed by the federal opposition. Labor's social services spokeswoman Linda Burney has on Monday introduced a bill to get the ball rolling on the changes. \"No one should have to choose between their livelihoods an d their safety,\" she told parliament. Ms Burney says the time off will help women planning to leave abusive partners, an event she described as anxiety -inducing and needing to occur swiftly. It takes careful planning, significant effort and cost. \"It just astounds me more attention is not paid to this national crisis - a crisis that saw four women last week alone die at the hands of their ex -partner or partner,\" Ms Burney said. \"Preventing family violence is everyone's business and responsibility.\" She is u rging the Morrison government to support the plan. The paid leave would also give people time to attend legal proceedings, counselling, medical and financial appointments. The bill changes the Fair Work Act to replace the existing entitlement of five days unpaid leave. Part-time and full -time employees would get their regular rate of pay covering their usual hours. Casuals would get paid for the period they were rostered on, including any loadings. The leave would be pro-rata for casuals and part -time work ers. The bill also acknowledges employee privacy is paramount, strengthening obligations on bosses to not disclose a worker has sought such leave. \"Information concerning an employee's experience of family and domestic violence is sensitive and if mishandl ed can have adverse consequences for the employee,\" the draft law says. \"Employers should consult with such employees regarding the handling of this information.\" Since late 2018, workers have had access to five days of unpaid domestic violence leave per y ear. At the time, the coalition government argued it was sufficient as it was the minimum benchmark recommended by the Fair Work Commission. From https://au.news.yahoo.com 12/07/2020 TOP New Guide for Where Future Jobs Will Be Perhaps unsurprisingly, jobs in health care and social assistance have proved the most resilient occupations during the COVID -19 pandemic. However, a new report by the National Skills Commission ha s also found education and training, construction and mining are among occupations that have best been able stand up to the impact of the coronavirus impact. The commission has developed a resilient occupations framework that ranks 358 professions. \"By dev eloping this framework, we have improved our understanding of what has been a highly volatile labour market,\" National Skills Commissioner Adam Boyton said, releasing the report on Monday. \"Jobs are starting to return even in some of the industries and occ upations most impacted by the shutdowns, but recovery is uneven, and young people are most affected.\" Employment and Skills Minister Michaelia Cash said the report shows where the new jobs will be created. \"Given the disruption in the labour market caused by COVID -19, knowing that the job you are training for now will still be there in the future is critical for all Australians and our future prosperity,\" Senator Cash said. \"The list of resilient jobs also provides for a mix of training requirements, which means Australians can train for them in the short and long term.\" She said it reinforces the Morrison government's work to make skills and vocational education and training (VET) more flexible and relevant to actual labour market demand. She said since coming to office, the government has focused on reforming the VET sector. \"COVID -19 has expedited these reforms,\" Senator Cash said. \"We have made the necessary changes to the VET sector to ensure the training that Australians are undertaking is relevant a nd fit for purpose.\" She said the government has invested almost $7 billion in the VET sector in this year alone. From https://au.news.yahoo.com 12/07/2020 TOP New Laws to End Casual Confusion New industrial relations laws to be introduced to parliament this week aim to end the confusion surrounding casual workers. Attorney -General and Industrial Relations Minister Christian Porter said there are many Australians still out of work, or doing fewer hours as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic. \"We cannot do nothing when we have a situation where employers are delaying making hiring decisions because of ongoing confusion about the legal status of casual employment,\" Mr Porter said. He thanks employer groups and unions that have helped to shape these reforms. Labor industrial relations spokesman Tony Burke urged people to be wary of suggestions the proposed laws would be good for casuals. Mr Burke says casuals will lose workplace rig hts if employers are able to abuse their conditions without consequences. \"Labor still hasn't seen the legislation but when you look closely at the reports it seems this is another example where the spin of the government announcement is the opposite of t he delivery,\" he said. The legislation to be introduced on Wednesday will cover three areas. It will introduce the statutory definition of casual employment in the Fair Work Act, which will include employment being offered without any firm advance commitme nt that the work will continue indefinitely and follow an agreed pattern of work. \"Our definition of casual employment is likely broader than some business groups had wanted,\" Mr Porter said. \"Unions are likely to say we should have made the definition bro ader still, suggesting to me that we have struck the right balance on this issue and delivered a fair and equitable outcome that will benefit both workers and employers.\" The legislation will address the so -called \"double -dipping\" issue where currently employers may have to pay for sick leave and other leave as well as the 25 per cent casual loading meant to compensate for those benefits. The government will ensure employers do not have to pay worker entitlements twice by legislating to ensure that a court deducts any identifiable casual loading paid to compensate the employee for the absence of one or more entitlements. But Labor is concerned bosses could be the ones double -dipping. \"If an employer tries to take the reliability of a permanent roster but on ly offers the insecurity of casual work, it's the employer who is double -dipping,\" Mr Burke said. \"The government proposal would overturn the current cases which had protected workers where labour hire was causing casual workers to be paid less than the pe rmanent workers doing the exact same job.\" The new laws will also create a new minimum standard for casual conversion so that casuals who work regular shift patterns can move - if desired - to part -time or full -time employment after 12 months. \"These are significant reforms which together will solve the problem of uncertainty, provide better avenues for job security, remove the burden of double -dipping claims and recognise employee choice,\" Mr Porter said. From https: //au.news.yahoo.com 12/07/2020 TOP Call for Major Overhaul of Voting Laws A major report into the 2019 federal election has called for a new style of voting and flagged the need for more politicians to better represent Australians. The 228 -page report by parliament's joint standing committee on electoral matters made 27 recommendations, including voters for the first time being required to show identification at polling booths. And when they vote for House of R epresentatives members they should be given the option not to cast preferences, rather than compulsorily number all the boxes to have their vote counted. The committee said the parliament should consider a constitutional referendum to break the nexus betwe en the number of senators and the number of lower house members. A proposal to alter the constitution to break the nexus - that is, allow the lower house to expand without increasing the size of the Senate - was rejected in 1967. \"Parliament should commen ce a conversation about whether the parliament should be increased in size as the last increase was in 1984,\" the report said. \"Part of the dialogue should consider whether the nexus between the Senate and the House of Representatives should be reformed. \" In addition, consideration should be given to changing the term of the House of Representatives from three years to four years.\" The length of term change would also require the Senate to adopt eight -year terms instead of the current six for state senators . As well, by -elections for the lower house could be abolished with the party or group elected at the general election choosing the replacement. In a more controversial recommendation the committee said an MP who voluntarily resigns from the party under wh ich they were elected at the general election \"will be deemed to have vacated their seat\". Committee chair and LNP senator James McGrath said electoral reform was vital. \"We sleep safely in our beds protected from the claws of the banality of evil because we decide who governs,\" he wrote. \"These reforms are about empowering further the voter. Governments in democracies should always be wary of the voter. Long may it be so.\" The report also made recommendations in relation to donation reform, ending the pre -election broadcast media blackout, examining truth in political advertising rules, and putting in place a new offence of \"electoral violence\" to deal with candidates being stalked or intimidated.

In the interim report Prof Samuel said Australia's natural environment was under increasing threat, with the current trajectory unsustainable. He described the current laws as not fit for purpose. His key advice was for an independent environmental watchdog and for states to take on approvals to reduce red tape and costs. But Professor Samuel also wanted new national environmental standards to provide clear rules for the states as they take on decision -making from federal authorities. The prime mini ster has pushed that step down the track, despite the government already knowing what recommendations are in the final report. Mr Morrison and his state and territory counterparts met in person for the first time in months on Friday, marking the final nati onal cabinet meeting of the year. They agreed on pushing for the environmental protection changes. \"This means you go through one process, you go through one decision maker,\" Mr Morrison said. The government's argument is the current process is too slow an d costly but critics of the plan say it further risks Australia's environment. Victorian Premier Dan Andrews says the changes aren't about that. \"It is about how you make the decision, not the decision itself,\" he said. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palasz czuk expects the streamlined process to be well received. But that hasn't been the case so far, with a Senate inquiry into the proposed laws warned against the changes by scores of environment groups. Key cross bench senators Jacqui Lambie, Rex Patrick an d Stirling Griff have said they won't support the changes. Mr Morrison wants the bill to pass next year but faces a battle with the three crossbenchers, Labor and the Greens opposing it. The government used its numbers in the lower house to push the bill t hrough without it being properly debated, with some independent MPs not even able to introduce amendments or speak on the draft laws. From https://au.news.yahoo.com 12/11/2020 TOP The New Laws and Changes Coming into Force in 2021 As we prepare to put 2020 in our rear view mirror, Australians are no doubt keen to look ahead to 2021. But there will be some changes - good and bad - heading our way in the new year. Many of th e notable changes relate to government policies brought in to help Aussies endure the coronavirus crisis. Some changes, like the Jobkeeper allowance will come into effect in the coming days, while others such as a planned tax on electric vehicles in certai n states will happen mid year. Jobkeeper and JobSeeker changes For those relying on the federal government's JobKeeper payment, brought in as the pandemic decimated the economy back in March, the dollar amount is about to drop. From 4 January 2021, the Job Keeper Payment rate is either: $1000 per fortnight $650 per fortnight - if you've worked less than 20 hours a week on average during February or June 2020. The JobKeeper payment is set to end on the 28th of March, 2021. For those looking for a job, the bu mp in financial assistance in the form of the so -called Coronavirus Supplement is also about to drop. From January 1 this year, those on JobSeeker will be topped up at a rate of $150 per fortnight, down from $250 per fortnight. Reduced HomeBuilder grant ro lls over The federal government announced an extension for its HomeBuilder grant for those who are seeking to build a new home or renovate an existing home. Due to expire at the end of 2020, the government announced an extension of the grant until 31 March 2021, albeit at a significantly reduced rate. For contracts signed between January 1 and the 31st of March 2021, eligible grant seekers can claim $15,000 - down from the original $25,000. Relaxed rules for partnership visas Partner visa hopefuls will no longer have to leave Australia to get their applications approved under temporary changes expected to help 4,000 people. The changes will kick in early in the new year and are to assist people attempting to navigate coronavirus -related travel restrictions and hotel quarantine. \"I know this will be a relief to those Australians who were concerned that their loved one may have to leave the country with no certainty as to when they could return,\" Acting immigration minister Alan Tudge said last month. New tena ncy laws in Victoria A raft of more than 130 tenancy reforms will be introduced by March 29 for those in Victoria. They were due to start on July 1, 2019, but were pushed back due to the pandemic. The new laws, which followed a lengthy review, aim to ens ure that Victoria's rental sector meets the needs of tenants and landlords, now and into the future, the state government said. The array of reforms include better protection and support for victims of family violence living in rental accommodation, and m ake it easier for tenants to keep pets. You can read more about the introduction of the Residential Tenancies Amendment Act 2018 here. Healthcare reforms Reforms to private health insurance will see policies tweaked, increasing the maximum age of dependant s to 31. The move is designed to make private healthcare more accessible for Australians and was announced in the latest federal budget. It means the maximum age for dependants under family private health insurance policies jumps from 24 to 31 years. The change will come into effect from April 1. South Australia's plastic ban comes into effect South Australia's ban on single -use plastics, such as straws and cutlery, will come into force from March 2021. The measures, the first of their kind in Australia, w ere passed in parliament in September but were put on hold because of the COVID -19 pandemic. They have also been designed to allow more items to be progressively added to the banned list, with the government targeting polystyrene cups, bowls and plates to go by early 2022. Fines could be imposed on businesses that don't comply with the new rules but Environment Minister David Speirs said he didn't think they would be necessary. \"I don't expect that to be the case because I think first and foremost, consumer s are driving this and businesses by their very nature need to respond to consumers,\" the minister said. Changes to immigration law The federal government will be making some significant changes to its visa system making it tougher for business migrants t o take up jobs in Australia. The current Business Innovation and Investment Program (BIIP) includes three visas and nine streams for applicants but that will be simplified to four streams (Business Innovation, Entrepreneur, Investor, and Significant Invest or) and there will be changes to eligibility requirements, making it more stringent.

Under our reforms, your super will follow you, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said in his October federal budget speech. The new measures aim to tie a worker to their first super fund for life and will come into effect on July 1, 2021. At the same time, you can expect a tax cut at the end of the financial year after the government pushed through the legislation in 2020. New milk code becomes mandatory A new milk code introduced by the consumer and competition regulator on January 1, 2020, will become mandatory for those in the early parts of the diary supply chain. The industry code regulates the conduct of farmers and milk processors in their dealings with one another. From 1 January 2021, all milk supply agreements, regardless of when they were entered into, must be compliant with the code, the ACCC said this month . The ACCC has been engaging with the dairy industry over the past year to help farmers and processors better understand their obligations and rights under this new mandatory code, ACCC Deputy Chair Mick Keogh said. The code, among other things, prohibit s retrospective price \"step downs\" by processors, and bans exclusive supply arrangements deemed detrimental to dairy farmers. Prepare for a tax on electric vehicles South Australia recently announced it would be the first state in the country to impose a n ew tax on electric vehicles to make up for the fuel excise, which is said to raise money for the upkeep of roads. Victoria soon followed suit while the country's peak motoring organisation, the Australian Automobile Association, is calling for the taxing of electric vehicle owners to be rolled out on a national basis. South Australia expects their yet -to-be-detailed charge to raise $1 million a year starting in July. Victoria's will also come into effect in July. Assisted dying on the agenda for NSW An ind ependent NSW MP says he will draft fresh legislation on access to voluntary euthanasia in the state, with debate to take place in early 2021. Sydney MP Alex Greenwich said in a statement on December 13 that voluntary assisted dying should be legalised in N SW for terminally ill patients, following the lead of Western Australia and Victoria. New Zealand also recently passed euthanasia laws via a referendum, with laws to come into effect in 2021. Mr Greenwich encouraged his parliamentary colleagues to begin di scussing the matter with their constituents ahead of debates in the new year. From https://au.news.yahoo.com 12/30/2020 TOP Liberals Ponder Emissions Trading Scheme John Howard's coalition government was warming to an emissions trading scheme in the year 2000. Twenty -year-old cabinet papers - released by the National Archives of Australia - reveal a government on a trajectory towards an ETS, with the Australian Greenhouse Office commissioned to conduct a feasibility study. Then -environment minister Robert Hill backed a market -based approach, noting in a submission to cabinet that environmental issues had a high public profile. The policy was in line with the coalition's mar ket-oriented economic philosophy, encouraged by its success in introducing the goods and services tax. Senator Hill told cabinet he was developing a new initiative designed to encourage businesses to adopt environmentally -sensitive processes in their opera tions. In the other corner sat industry and resources minister, Nick Minchin. Cabinet papers show him in action championing, with then -treasurer Peter Costello, a liquefied natural gas plan. Senator Minchin argued that future greenhouse gas abatement acti on should not render Australian industries, including LNG, uncompetitive. But he acknowledged market -based mechanisms were the most efficient and least costly means of achieving Australia's greenhouse gas targets. In August 2003, Mr Costello took a propose d cap and trade ETS to cabinet, where it was rejected, reportedly following industry lobbying of Mr Howard. The prime minister may not then have been convinced of the merits of an ETS but that changed and in June 2007, he announced a scheme was government policy and would be in place by 2012. Archives consultant historian Christine Wallace said this was one of the great \"what ifs\" of recent Australian political history. \"What if Howard had won the 2007 election? What if Costello had succeeded Howard prior to the 2007 election and gone on to win it?\" She asked. \"Both had committed to an ETS. Both were practised in initiating, marketing and implementing a new tax, as they showed so capably with the GST. \"Had either of these counterfactual scenarios actually c ome about, an ETS might already have been operating in Australia for years - an accepted, unremarked -upon aspect of public finance in Australia, just like the once -controversial GST.\" As it turned out, Labor won the 2007 election. Kevin Rudd declared clima te change one of the great moral, economic and environmental challenges. But efforts to legislate an ETS got bogged down. It was left to new Labor PM Julia Gillard to introduce a carbon price, against which opposition leader Tony Abbott campaigned vigorous ly, terming it \"the great big tax on everything\". Mr Abbott set about dismantling Labor's climate policies upon winning government in 2013. Back in 2000, the coalition was at best green in part. Although Australia had signed the 1998 Kyoto Protocol on emi ssions, Mr Howard declined to ratify it on grounds that it would disadvantage Australia. Interestingly, Senator Hill sought to make approval for the Kogan Creek coal -fired power station conditional on \"the difference in greenhouse gas emissions between it and an equivalent gas -fired power station be fully offset by investment in sinks.\" The environment department's submission noted that the combined emissions of Kogan and an alumina project would account for a quarter of all future emissions growth Australi a was permitted under Kyoto. From https://au.news.yahoo.com 12/31/2020 TOP Asia -Pacific COVID -19 Crisis Adds Pressure to Private and Public Pensions Systems The COVID -19 crisis has compounded the challenges facing retirement savings and old-age pension arrangements and added new ones, according to a new OECD report. The OECD Pensions Outlook 2020 says that population ageing, low growth, low returns and low interest rates were already weighing heavily on funded and pay-as-you-go pension plans, defined benefit and defined contribution sch emes, as well as private and public retirement provisions before the outbreak of the pandemic. The shocks from the global health and economic crisis will likely keep economic growth, interest rates and returns low long into the future, putting many people at risk of not being able to save enough for retirement. Governments have taken a range of swift measures to improve the sustainability and resilience of pension arrangements in response to COVID -19. These include extending job -retention schemes and unempl oyment benefits that allow workers to keep accruing retirement benefit entitlements, or providing flexibility around pension plans. Countries need to strike a balance between the short -term income support provided by measures like granting people access to their retirement savings before they reach retirement age, and the potential negative effect of such measures on future retirement incomes, said OECD Secretary -General Angel Gurr\u00eda. Allowing access to retirement savings should be a measure of last res ort, and based on hardship 2Government System and Civil Services circumstances rather than being granted widely and unconditionally. The COVID -19 crisis has also underlined the importance of having long -term savings for emergencies, he added. Introducing long -term savings arrangements that combine a savings account earmarked for retirement and a savings account for emergencies could make retirement savings more resilient. The report recommends that policy makers: Ensure people continue saving for retirement and avoid selling assets and materialising losses when markets suffer sharp declines. Adopt a framework to assess retirement income adequacy and conduct assessments regularly, identifying groups at risk and responding to their specific adequacy shortfalls. Consider targeted measures to make sure that workers in non -standard forms of work - part-time and temporary employees, self -employed workers and informal workers - have the opportunity to save for retirement. Address the potential negative consequences of frequent switching of inv estment strategies on future retirement income and the stability of financial markets. Have in place a regulatory framework that ensures that risk sharing arrangements are sustainable and promote fairness among participants, allowing all to enjoy the bene fits of risk sharing in terms of risk mitigation and higher expected retirement income. Ensure communication about investment strategies, their associated risks, rewards and costs, is consistent and standardised, adapted to the target audience, and avoids jargon and complex metrics.

It was agreed at the Wednesday meeting that further improving financial services and promoting the devel opment of personal insurance is conducive to better serving people's essential needs and facilitating economic and social development. China's personal insurance has seen sound and fast development in recent years with commercial personal insurance reachin g a considerable coverage nationwide, yet problems such as insufficient supply and low level of protection still exist, said the meeting. \"The personal insurance sector in China has made notable progress in recent years, with insurance coverage continuousl y expanding and public awareness of risks steadily increasing. That said, the sophistication and coverage of China's personal insurance sector remain modest. This also indicates that China is a huge insurance market with enormous potential,\" Li said. Att endees at the meeting emphasized the need to deepen reform and opening -up of the insurance sector, with a focus on optimizing supply and providing high -quality personal -insurance products, to meet people's needs for health, old -age support and safety prote ction. The development of commercial insurance shall be stepped up. Commercial medical insurance products that suit the needs and paying capacity of the elderly shall be developed. Insurance companies will be encouraged to incorporate medical expenses, wit hin reasonable range yet outside basic medical insurance catalog, into insurance coverage. \"We must focus on key areas, especially the medical insurance or commercial health insurance. More types of insurance targeting critical illnesses shall be support ed and aligned with the basic medical insurance system as supplement to enhance critical illness insurance protection for urban and rural residents,\" the premier said. \"Openness shall be extended in an orderly manner, and international cooperation strength ened, to promote the development of health insurance and provide better services. At the current stage, medical insurance remains a top priority to meet people's growing demand for greater health,\" he said. Commercial endowment insurance, which serves as t he third pillar of China's pension system, will be put under unified standards and regulations, and its development will be stepped up. The protection function of commercial endowment insurance shall be intensified. Endowment insurance featuring convenient application, flexible payment and relatively stable earnings shall be supported, and pension annuity insurance products actively developed. The insurance sector is encouraged to participate in a pilot insurance scheme for long-term care. \"Commercial endowment insurance shall be vigorously developed. In the past few years, new industries and new business models have emerged as China deepens reform of government functions and encourages entrepreneurial and innovation activities nationwide,\" L i said. \"Suitable supplementary endowment insurance shall be developed to cater to the needs of people working in these businesses, as well as of those in flexible employment, to ensure a more reliable guarantee for the future. It will help sustain existin g jobs and create new jobs. This is a major task, and breakthroughs shall be made,\" he said. The long -term investment capabilities of insurance funds are to be enhanced, while the supervision of assets and liabilities will be strengthened, and risk prevent ion and control stepped up. Differentiated regulatory ratio shall be adopted for equity assets involving insurance fund investments, up to 45 percent of the company's total assets. Insurance funding will be encouraged to participate in major construction projects, such as infrastructure and new -type urbanization, to better facilitate its role in driving the real economy. Special rectification regarding related -party transactions will be carried out, to resolutely deter illegal acts of misuse, arbitrage or embezzlement of insurance company funds. \"Risk prevention and control must be enhanced on an ongoing basis to prevent speculative use of insurance funds. Greater efforts shall be made to address the difficulty in settling insurance claims and draw more pe ople to participate in insurance schemes,\" Li said. From http://www.new s.cn/ 12/09/2020 TOP China to Deepen Reform of Government Functions, Raise Service Capacity for Businesses, Public China will optimize government service hotlines, improve the efficiency and capacity of government services for businesses and individuals, and implement unified registration for pledge of movable property and rights to facilitate pledge financing for businesses, the State Council executive meeting chaired by Premier Li Keqiang decided on Monday. Government service hotline is directly oriented to businesses and the public, and serves as an important channel to report problems, make suggestions, faci litate government decision -making and help solve public service issues. It has played a positive role in addressing pressing concerns for enterprises and people in recent years. Attendees at the Monday meeting decided that going forward, regarding the larg e numbers of government service hotlines and inconvenience in accessing services, service hotlines will be optimized in keeping with the requirements of deepening reform of government functions. Local governments, especially governments at county and city levels, should fulfill due responsibilities for non -emergency hotlines related to enterprises and people, according to the meeting. Service hotlines set up by governments at local levels and those established by relevant departments of the State Council a nd operated at the local levels shall be merged, wherever possible, into one unified number, to the convenience of the people. This embodies services at a single window. Relevant departments of the State Council shall guide localities in optimizing hotline s, the meeting decided. Optimized hotlines shall be convenient for people to access. Procedures and resource allocation should be refined, and technical support should be strengthened to better align hotline operations with related handling services. A sound mechanism to efficiently deal with complaints, as well as monitoring and accountability mechanisms, shall be established to see that problems and reasonable demands raised by businesses and people are properly handled in a timely manner, and to ensure t hat government service hotlines can be swiftly accessed, public concerns be more accurately referred to relevant departments and things get done efficiently, it said. \"We have been working hard to transform government functions and make it easier for busi nesses and the people to get things done,\" Li said. \"Regarding hotline operation and case handling, multi -level targeted approaches shall be adopted, and due responsibilities specified, with high attention paid to localities at city and county levels. Guid ance from relevant departments shall be stepped up,\" he said. It was decided at the meeting that unified registration for pledge of movable property and rights will be implemented nationwide starting Jan. 1, 2021, to further improve business environment an d facilitate the financial sector to better serve the real economy, micro, small and medium -sized enterprises in particular. In recent years, pilot programs of unified registration for pledge of movable property and rights have been carried out in certain provinces and cities, to facilitate enterprises' pledge financing. Privately -owned firms and micro, small, and medium -sized enterprises accounted for more than 95 percent of new pledge registration, and their amount of financing took up over 80 percent. Registration responsibility for pledge of production equipment, raw materials, semi -finished products, and product mortgages previously undertaken by the State Administration for Market Regulation, and registration responsibility for pledge of accounts rec eivables, deposits, financial leases, as well as factoring by the People's Bank of China, will all be assumed by the latter. Internet -based services will be provided 24/7. Those that have already completed registration for pledge of movable property and ri ghts will not be required for re -registration. Relevant departments shall properly handle follow -up work such as data transfer of inventory information. New registrations shall be applied by relevant parties through the unified registration and notificat ion system, and they will be held accountable for the authenticity, completeness and legality of the application. Registration departments will not conduct substantive review of the registration contents. The unified registration system is conducive for fi nancial institutions to get a full picture of movable property and rights information and enhance their readiness to provide pledge financing to enterprises. \"Unified registration for pledge of movable property and rights requires the financial system to s trengthen and improve management services for the enterprises, and will play a positive role in easing the burden on small and medium -sized enterprises, and in facilitating pledge financing. The financial system must make great efforts to improve services, \" Li said. The meeting also adopted draft revisions of the Regulation on Business Name Registration and Administration, to refine basic norms and put in place an application system for corporate names where applicants can choose a corporate name that meets the requirements and pledge to bear legal responsibilities for any name infringements. Both deregulation and oversight will be stepped up. Registration departments shall enhance compliance oversight, and refuse to register or correct the corporate names inconsistent with the requirements. Disputes over corporate names may be settled through lawsuits or mediated or decided by registration departments. \"Corporate name registration shall facilitate fair competition and independent business operations within the confines of the law,\" Li said.

The move is aimed at accelerat ing the digitization of administrative procedures by securing specialized personnel for a digital agency, scheduled to be established in September next year, as well as for other ministries and agencies. The category is planned to be introduced in the exam ination in fiscal 2022, which screens national civil servants who will start working in April 2023. The government hopes to select a maximum of a few dozen recruits who are familiar with such matters as cybersecurity and building information systems. About 170 college and graduate school graduates are hired every year under the engineering category. Part of the number allocated for the engineering category is likely to be transferred to the new digital sector category, the sources said. The government wil l soon include the new classification of categories in the national civil service exams in its process chart for the digitization of administrative procedures, which will be compiled soon. Currently, there are 11 categories in the national civil service ex am for college graduate -level recruits. The new category will be the first addition since fiscal 2012, when the exam was reorganized to its present form. Government officials in charge of digital -related issues currently receive about \u00a5 10,000 of extra pay per month in salary. The government is also considering to increase this amount. Focused efforts in hiring are planned because of a shortage of personnel who are well -versed in digital -related issues, as skilled workers are offered better pay and working c onditions at tech firms and other entities. This discrepancy has contributed to the government's sluggish response in digitization efforts. Competition to secure talented workers in the digital field is becoming fierce. Hitachi Ltd. established a new hirin g system wherein new recruits will be directly assigned to digital -related research and development teams, for those who start working in fiscal 2021.

The new entry log system will be test -operated in parts of the government compl ex in the central administrative city of Sejong and later expanded to other government buildings in Seoul and other cities, according to the ministry. The AI -based face recognition system for public officials will be installed in Building 3 of the Sejong c omplex, it said. Currently, the officials have to verify both their face and identification cards, but under the new system, they only have to pass the AI face recognition to enter the building. The ministry said the change will also help prevent the sprea d of infectious diseases by minimizing human contact, while enabling the introduction of different services, such as automatic body temperature checks. The QR code system will first be used by those who tour the rooftop garden in the Sejong complex. Visito rs will have better accessibility as they won't have to submit their ID cards to receive a visitors' pass and won't be required to be accompanied by authorities if they download the QR code on their mobile phones in advance, the ministry explained.

Korea to Phase Out Public Key Certification System South Korea said Wednesday it will phase out an official public key certification system this week in a move to introduce easier -to-use verification services. South Koreans have used public key certificates since 1999 for verification in digital services, such as online banking and tax returns. The system, however, has been criticized in recen t years for being outdated and difficult to use as it requires installation of multiple security software. Getting rid of the system altogether was one of President Moon Jae -in's campaign promises back in 2017. Following the recent revision to the country' s digital signature law, the Ministry of Science and ICT said the existing system will no longer be the country's sole official verification system starting Thursday, paving the way for companies to replace the system with their own verification services. One of the alternatives includes Pass, a mobile verification application from the country's three major mobile carriers SK Telecom Co., KT Corp and LG Uplus Corp. Pass has racked up 20 million registrations since its launch in April last year, according to the companies. The ministry said as of end -November, there were 66.5 million registrations for electronic verification services from the private sector, compared with 46.8 million for the public system.

From https://en.trend.az/ 12/08/2020 TOP Azerbaijan to Create 'Government -Cloud' National Data Center Azerbaijan will create National Data Center 'Government Cloud' (G -cloud) on the basis of the Data Center operating under the Azintelecom LLC of the Ministry of Transport, Communications and High Technologies, Trend reports citing the ministry. The respective preparatory work is underway within the Transitional Plan on measures for the creation of the G -cloud and cloud services. The future center will ensure the stable operation of the Government Cloud', recovery of work from the archive, and protection of data during cyberattacks, emergency situations, and martial law. At present, the project infrastructure is being developed and, in accordance with the transitional plan, the migration of state structures to the G -cloud will begin. The G -cloud is a major project that includes reducing costs in public administration and increasing coordination between government structures by effectively integrating government information systems and reserves into a single platform. T he project's implementation will ensure the operation of state information systems, the deployment of their infrastructure, and the formation of standards, as well as reduce the cost of creating and storing information systems in public administration and the formation of a centralized infrastructure for state institutions. Thus, an opportunity will be created to optimize the costs required by government agencies for information technology, the creation, and provision of digital services, and the organiza tion of information systems in a high -quality, stable and secure infrastructure based on more modern standards. With the implementation of the Government Cloud' project, public institutions will be able to reduce the cost of IT infrastructure. Thus, cloud technologies allow for more efficient use of resources, providing management of IT infrastructure from a single platform based on the pool principle'. New data centers based on modern world standards for cloud services will be brought into compliance wit h the international certificate of the Uptime Institute TIER III organization, standards for the provision and management of IT services ISO-20000, and information security ISO 27001. Besides, the equipment used in the data centers will be controlled accor ding to the N +' principle, which means the use of second backup equipment in order to ensure continuity of service in the event of any preventive maintenance on the equipment or a technical failure. Thus, correct and reliable management of information te chnology in 99.982 percent of cases will provide a level of resilience to safely perform this process. State institutions connected to the G -cloud will be able to manage IT resources allocated for them via a self -administration platform. The Ministry of Tr ansport, Communications, and High Technologies have developed the architecture of the G -cloud, according to which the cloud's activities are planned to be carried out through active, backup, archive, and test Data Centers. From https://en.trend.az/ 12/22/2020 TOP President Aliyev's Brilliant Leadership, Wisdom Ensured Azerbaijan's Victory in Second Karabakh War President Ilham Aliyev's brilliant leadership and wisdom ensured Azerbaijan's victory in the Second Karabakh War, US expert, CEO of Caspian Group Holdings Rob Sobhani told Trend . Sobhani believes that Azerbaijan's victory is based on a number of mutually reinforcing facto rs. First, the brilliant leadership of President Aliyev and the timing of launching the Second Karabakh War. President Aliyev, it appears, sensed a vacuum in the global arena; I call it a vacuum of leadership by the Minsk Group members (Russia, U.S. and F rance). The second factor is the wisdom President Aliyev has shown when it comes to conducting Azerbaijan's foreign policy. Unlike the inexperience of Prime Minister Pashinyan, the experience of President Aliyev allowed Azerbaijan to maintain good and frie ndly relations with two regional powers, namely Russia and Turkey. By making a rational case for why this Second Karabakh War is a Just War President Aliyev was able to win the support of these two important countries. Third, I think that Azerbaijan's re lations with Israel were also critical. The technological superiority of Israel's military -industrial complex was recognized early on by President Aliyev. A fourth important factor that lead to a victory for Azerbaijan was innovative and creative technolog ies used in modern day drones. This introduction of modern technology was a very important factor that tilted the balance of military power in favor of Azerbaijan. This is a very important lesson for the future of Azerbaijan; namely to invest in innovative and creative technologies such as bio-tech, artificial intelligence, electric vehicle batteries, graphene based solar panels and e -commerce. And last but critically important we must never forget that the Second Karabakh War was won due to the courage of Azerbaijan's brave soldiers. Their memory must always be kept alive, the US expert explained. He went on to add that the reconstruction and development of Karabakh will obviously be a top priority. Therefore, what is needed now a \"Marshall Plan for Karab akh\": inviting the U.S. European and Asian powers such as China, Japan and South Korea, to finance major infrastructure projects in Karabakh ranging from roads, bridges, power generation, water management to transportation links and tourism. Specifically , what Azerbaijan can do now is to identify specific projects to present to banks for financing based on public -private partnerships. For example, it can present feasibility studies on solar panel and battery production facilities in Shusha which would be of enormous interest to the European Investment Bank. The liberation of Karabakh and its surrounding areas creates a historic opportunity for small and medium size businesses in these areas to transport their products to warehouses in Baku for sale to the global marketplace via e -commerce portals. Transportation links via high speed rail using technologies from Japan, China or France can connect Baku to Karabakh, Sobhani concluded.

The Morrison government will on Wednesday introduce industrial relations legislation designed to cover five key reform areas. It will address the definition of casual employment, long -term greenfields agreements across the life of major projects, award simplification, compliance and changes to enterprise bargaining. Mr Porter said the government would not be obstinate about any par t of the bill. \"It's not going to be an all -or-nothing proposal,\" he told reporters in Canberra on Friday. The legislation will be scrutinised by a parliamentary committee before likely being voted on next year. Government -led industrial relations working groups of employers and unions discussed the key reform areas ahead of the laws being drafted. Mr Porter wants consultations to continue once the bill is introduced to parliament. \"I will be listening carefully not merely to all the business groups but al so the union groups about their views on the final product,\" he said. \"It's quite clear that not everyone is going to love everything in the final product and it has been something of a balancing exercise.\" He said everything in the bill was important beca use the reforms were based on job creation. In the working groups, unions proposed allowing resource and construction projects worth more than $5 billion to have one -year extensions provided there was dispute resolution on the sites. But mining and resourc e employers wanted greenfields agreements doubled to eight years. ACTU secretary Sally McManus has raised concerns the legislation could remove workers' rights and punish supermarket staff, young people and women. \"We fear it will seek to weaken protection s, when the experience of the pandemic has shown the importance of having these protections, when we have been reminded that our social contract must be treasured,\" she told the National Press Club earlier in the week.

From https://au.news.yahoo.com 12/11/2020 TOP Labor Demands Action on Corruption Labor has slammed the federal government for failing to establish a new national anti-corruption watchdog within two years of promising to do so. The government in December 2018 pledged to set up a Commonwealth Integrity Commission and in November this year released draft laws for its establishment, with public consultation still taking place. The government hopes to bring a bill before parliament in 2021. Covering members of parliament and their staff, as well as bureaucrats and federal police, the CIC would have the power to compel people to give sworn evidence at hearings a nd imprison those who do not comply. As well, people could be compelled to provide information and produce documents - even if the information would incriminate the person. Surveillance and searches under warrant of homes would also be allowed. But Labor has opposed the privacy afforded to CIC hearings and the body's inability to launch its own investigations in most cases. Shadow Attorney -General Mark Dreyfus on Sunday lambasted the government's lack of urgency on establishing the CIC and its intransigenc e on the body's structure, saying it needed to be more powerful. \"Time and time again (Prime Minister) Scott Morrison and (Attorney -General) Christian Porter have shown they have no interest in tackling corruption and are too scared of what a powerful and independent integrity commission will do to their scandal -prone government,\" Mr Dreyfus said in a statement. \"All we've seen is a draft bill for a weak, secretive and compromised commission that would cover up corruption, not expose it.\" The government ha s committed $147 million to the CIC, including shifting the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity under its remit. Senate powerbroker Jacqui Lambie has threatened to vote against all government legislation if it persists with the \"toothless\" commission, while the Greens labelled the CIC \"a protection racket for corrupt politicians\". Barrister and director of the Centre for Public Integrity, Geoffrey Watson, described the CIC as a \"sham\" and said it was designed to cover up corruption. From https://au.news.yahoo.com 12/13/2020 TOP Midnight Tax Grab Becomes Lasting Reform On the stroke of midnight July 1, 2000 Australia gained a brand -new tax, the long-anticipated GST which added a 10 per cent tariff to the cost of almost everything. While many items became more expensive, some consumables remained the same price and others, where the goods and services tax replaced a higher rate of wholesale sales tax, actually bec ame cheaper. Cabinet documents for 2000 - released by the National Archives of Australia - reveal the extensive effort conducted in the lead -up to July 1, 2000 to prepare the nation for this far -reaching economic reform. For example, what about those venue s such as nightclubs, hotels and supermarkets which traded through the changeover? Cabinet decided they didn't need to shut their cash registers and reopen to set up for the new GST regime until normal closing time later on July 1. That first morning, then-prime minister John Howard - who in May 1995 as opposition leader promised there would \"never ever\" be a GST on his watch - checked out the reception of the new tax with visits to Sydney shopping centres. He found reaction of shoppers and shopkeepers ranged from positive to indifferent, he recalled in his biography Lazarus Rising. \"A sensible broadening of Australia's narrow tax base had been achieved after a generation -long public discussion of its merits and demerits,\" said archives historian, Univer sity of Canberra Associate Professor Dr Christine Wallace. In the lead -up to July 1, the government conducted an extensive education and information campaign to prepare the community and business sector for the new tax. It was a big job. In February, the g overnment committed an extra $20 million to sell the GST to the community. Despite that considerable effort, its introduction still had to be followed by an extensive bedding -down period. Cabinet documents disclose a number of decisions relating to adjust ing GST processes, for which the main burden fell on businesses. In November, the Australian Taxation Office raised a number of issues, noting \"the large and growing number of requests for assistance from the ATO for advisory visits and through calls to th e helplines\". This was about the time businesses had to submit their first Business Activity Statement, or BAS. Mr Howard later said the BAS was too complicated, yet Treasury resisted any change, as did Treasurer Peter Costello in the belief that any chang e signified retreat. Not until the following year was the form simplified. Australia had long considered a broad -based consumption tax to apply to goods and services (with a few exemptions) and which was paid by everyone. That was advocated by the Asprey committee, commissioned by the McMahon government in 1971. At various times in the 1980s Paul Keating and John Howard favoured a GST. Opposition leader John Hewson campaigned on a GST at the 1993 election and lost. The impetus for the coalition government under John Howard was the 1997 High Court decision invalidating state indirect taxes and leaving the Commonwealth to make up the shortfall. The federal government could have got by with minimal change but in August 1997, Mr Howard invited Australia on a \"g reat tax adventure\". After narrowly winning the 1998 election, Mr Howard had a mandate to proceed with the GST. One government priority was to have the GST in place ahead of the Sydney Olympics to reap the benefit of visitor spending. Professor Wallace sa id the government achieved a near -textbook demonstration of how to initiate and implement a controversial public policy. \"It is a signal demonstration that a controversial, politically -risky policy, properly handled, can quite quickly become a routine, unr emarked upon aspect of daily life,\" she said. From https://au.news.yahoo.com 12/31/2020 TOP Asia -Pacific The Road to Smart City Infrastructure Starts with Research Mathew Yarger Contributor Mathew is Head of Mobility and Automotive at the IOTA Foundation, where he develops strategy and solutions around the use of data with distributed ledger technology -based innovations. These solutions focus on enabling flexible and privacy -centric data and value transfer within the public sector for use in smart cities, critical infrastructure, environmental and energy system s, and mobility -focused data industries. In the United States, critical city, state and federal infrastructure is falling 3Management , Capacity Building and Innovation behind. While heavy investment, planning and development have gone into the U.S. infrastructure system, much of it is not keeping up w ith the pace of new technology, and some of it hasn't had a proper update in decades, instead just adding new systems onto old systems. This can be allotted to a combination of liability structures in the U.S., difficulty in enabling interconnection betwee n infrastructure in different jurisdictions, worry over introducing large -scale security risks and an attempt to mitigate that risk. There is interest in upgrading city systems to be more efficient, to be more in line with real-time demand and to move int o the 21st century, but it's going to take work. It's also going to take new technology. Distributed ledger technology (DLT), when applied correctly, can do for a city's infrastructure what existing technologies cannot. Where existing technologies are heav y, requiring expensive servers and a larger energy draw, distributed ledger technology is light and can be implemented on individual nodes (code environments) and directly onto things like traffic light sensors. It also allows for more oversight from a pri vacy perspective. The ability to bring distributed ledger technology into lightweight frameworks allows for more security and upgrades to critical infrastructure. Benefits of smart infrastructure The biggest impact of smart infrastructure is that it enables local governments to focus on the reason they're there in the first place; to increase the quality of life of the local residents, bring stability and culture to local businesses, and create a welcoming and frictionless environment for tourists or visitors. Governments can create stability, streamline sources of revenue, and integrate a frictionless operational environment for people and organizations in their jurisdiction. Consider transportation infrastructure. A lot of revenue in cities and state s comes from things like tolls and roadside parking, and of course taxes. States control the highways, interstates, and tolling infrastructure commonly through collaboration with service providers. Cities control the local roadside and passthrough streets and the revenue accrued through parking solutions. With the pandemic, these resources have dried up due to people staying at home, social distancing, using less public transit and working remotely. This now offers an opportunity for an expanded example of the desire to understand the transportation flow. If cities had more real time insights into this, they'd be able to understand the demand and have a more fluidly flowing traffic condition. This can be done through new technologies such as what are seen d eployed in Singapore like green link determinings systems, parking guidance systems, and expressway monitoring systems allowing for enhanced traffic awareness and guidance. There are also keen ways to incentivize traffic guidance while bringing stability t o local small and medium businesses throughout cities such as using parking guidance systems to enable local businesses to offer discounts for parking nearby. An open transportation grid (in the sense of data points gathered for streamlining and managing) can create smoother traffic patterns in cities with smaller road grids. Transportation centers could communicate with delivery services, understanding their routes and setting up parking reservation windows. Traffic flow could be managed so that delivery services are able to get in and out without causing back -ups on tight, busy roads. Another offering of smart infrastructure can be seen with cross border connections for transportation of goods and services. The ownership of infrastructure in the U.S. is h ighly fragmented; with cities owning local and neighborhood roadsides, and states owning highways and interstates. This also means that the infrastructure supporting this is highly distributed, because each entity has to have it's own systems in place to s upport their infrastructure, typically using different solutions, services and data structures.

The findings in Non -exhaust Particulate Emissions from Road Transport: An ignored Environmental Policy Challenge sugge st that electric vehicles should not be exempted from tolls and congestion charges aimed at reducing road traffic emissions. Instead, road traffic regulations should consider both exhaust and non -exhaust emissions from all vehicles and should take into a ccount factors like vehicle weight and tyre composition. Policy makers should also favour measures that reduce driving distances, limit urban vehicle access and encourage public transport, walking and cycling. Exposure to airborne particulate matter (PM) is associated with acute respiratory infections, lung cancer, and chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Road traffic is behind a quarter of PM2.5, the most damaging type, in urban areas yet only exhaust emissions of PM are regulated. No standar ds exist for measuring or regulating non -exhaust PM emissions. As particulate matter emitted from exhaust sources decreases with the uptake of electric vehicles, the majority of PM released into the air by road traffic could come from non -exhaust sources a s early as 2035. The amount of non -exhaust particulate matter a vehicle emits is determined by many factors, including vehicle weight, driving styles, the material composition of brakes, tyres and roads, and the amount of dust on road surfaces. Lightweight electric vehicles with a driving range of about 100 miles (161 km) emit an estimated 11 -13% less PM2.5 than conventional vehicles in the same segment. However, heavier electric vehicles with battery packs enabling a range of 300 miles (483 km) emit an estimated 3 -8% more PM2.5 than equivalent conventional vehicles. The report finds that the total amount of non -exhaust particulate matter emitted by passenger vehicles worldwide is likely to rise by 53.5% by 2030. These findings underline the need to establi sh standardised approaches to measuring non -exhaust particulate matter and to develop a better understanding of how factors like vehicle characteristics influence the amount of PM generated, the report says. From https://www.oecd.org/ 12/07/2020 TOP Employers Must Remove Barriers to Work for All Generations Governments and employers should work together to promote multi -generational workforces to adapt to ongoing changes in the world of work that have been accelerated by the COVID -19 pandemic, according to a new OECD report. Promoting an Age -Inclusive Workforce says that, by 2050, more than four -in-ten people in the world's most advanced economies are likely to be aged old er than 50. And there will be one person aged 65 and over for every two persons aged 20 -64 in OECD economies compared to one for every three today. Yet current public employment and retirement policies, as well as many corporate practices, are often closel y tied to the age of workers, rather than to their actual work capacity and individual needs. Despite older adults being healthier and better educated than ever before today, their talent often remains underutilised and overlooked. Promoting greater dive rsity of experience, generations and talent has the potential to bring enormous benefits to workers, companies and society as a whole, said OECD Secretary -General Angel Gurr\u00eda. Employers need to develop initiatives that nurture an age -diverse workplace a nd take a life -cycle perspective with supportive public policies and good social dialogue. Living standards across the OECD would be improved substantially by increasing the participation of older workers in employment, according to the report. Extending working lives could boost GDP per capita by 19% in 2050 on average in OECD countries if employment rates of older workers everywhere caught up with the best performing countries like Iceland and New Zealand. Age -discrimination remains a common problem acr oss the world, restricting employment choices for older and sometimes even younger workers, representing a considerable cost to business. Rather than focusing on age, labour market policy should be tailored to different individual circumstances and contex ts. This implies eliminating age -bias recruitment practices and encouraging age diverse cultures where all workers feel comfortable and appreciated regardless of age. Retaining talent is key. The report provides evidence that employers who respond positive ly to the changing needs of employees during their lifecycle and career stages improve their success in attracting, motivating and retaining workers. These workers, in turn, are likely to make a greater contribution to their workplaces, and play a full par t in making it efficient and productive. Along with more flexible working arrangements, implementing returnship programmes and providing opportunities for career and financial planning throughout employees' lifecycles can act as effective retention policie s for both younger and older workers. Reverse mentorships also offer many advantages in the context of multigenerational workplaces and can help breakdown age -stereotypes. Governments and companies should revise their approach to training and skills devel opment. Currently, only 41% of adults across the OECD take part in job -related training. And employees who are younger, more highly qualified, and on full -time contracts are more likely to receive training than those who are older, lower skilled and workin g part -time. Encouraging people to maintain and develop their skills during their careers and lifetimes would generate significant productivity gains and help more older people extend their working lives. OECD Secretary -General Angel Gurr\u00ed a will launch the report at an online event at 16.00 CET on 16 December. Register.

From https://www.oecd.org/ 12/16/2020 TOP Evaluating the Impact Mechanism of Citizen Participation on Citizen Satisfaction in a Smart City Citizen satisfaction is an important issue for global city managers in the construction of a smart city. To date, little research has been done on the effect of citizen participation on citizen satisfaction in a smart city. From the perspective of citizen involvement and based on the theory of involvement and American Customer Satisfaction Index model, this study explores the impact mechanism of citizen partic ipation on citizen satisfaction in a smart city and constructs a theoretical model of citizen satisfaction. The data were collected in Qingdao, which is a smart city in China. The analysis shows that citizen involvement has a significant positive influence on citizen participation both cognitively and affectively. Furthermore, citizen participation produces a direct and significant positive impact on citizen satisfaction. Last, citizen participation can also have a significant positive influence on citizen satisfaction through perceived quality and perceived value. The main contribution of this study focuses on the construction of the impact mechanism model. Based on this model, researchers and city managers can understand the entire reaction process of the citizen ranging from subjective judgement to practical actions and then actual experiences in the construction of a smart city.

The winning app, String, designed by two Ma laysians, Hoo Xing Yu and Louis Ong Bing Hao, was announced at the 31st APEC Ministerial Meeting by the chair of the meeting and Malaysia's Minister of International Trade and Industry, Dato' Seri Mohamed Azmin Ali. \"This year, the word challenge has a w hole new meaning to it, Dato' Seri Azmin Ali said. He further added that in response to the current uncertain times, contestants were tasked to help small businesses acquire and apply new digital tools and services in the interest of post -COVID recovery. \" One of the things that has been a challenge to our daily life during this pandemic is adapting and adhering to the safe distancing measures, be it in public transport, in a mall or in a caf\u00e9 or restaurant, Louis explained. The app that we developed ai m to make safe distancing easier for customers and for the business itself. We have in mind that the app must be useful and we are grateful to have such opportunities to solve one of the issues small businesses are facing right now, added Xing Yu. The 2020 APEC App Challenge was held fully virtual for the first time, with 91 software developers and designers forming 15 teams from all across the 21 APEC member economies working together to bring forward ideas on how to support recovery for small business es in the tourism sector. It is very encouraging to see such innovation and ideas to support recovery of the tourism sector from our young talents in the region, said Dr Rebecca Sta Maria, Executive Director of the APEC Secretariat. APEC policymakers co uld tap into these practical and functional innovations we see in the APEC App Challenge to build back the tourism sector. Besides String winning the first prize of this year's challenge, a virtual interactive tourism platform, Choizy from Indonesia w on the second prize and a platform aims to minimize business volatility using data and machine learning, OctoDash from the United States won the third prize of the 2020 APEC App Challenge. The COVID -19 pandemic has only highlighted the key role played by digital technologies in our economy and society, said John Karr, the Asia Foundation's Senior Director of Technology Programs. The APEC App Challenge shows how a great community of innovators and software developers in Asia -Pacific can positively contrib ute to the region's recovery effort. \"It is great to see software developers in APEC economies come together to support the tourism sector, said Andrew Ure, Head of Public Affairs, Google Asia -Pacific.

From https://www.apec.org/ 12/02/2020 TOP ADB to Help Prevent and Control COVID -19 by Strengthening WASH+H Approach in Projects The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved a $2 million technical assistance (TA) grant to help select developing members prevent and control t he spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID -19) by expanding and integrating water, sanitation, hygiene, and health (WASH+H) approaches into ADB's projects. The $2 million grant comes from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction financed by the Government of Japan. The TA will direct resources toward ADB projects in the social sector, particularly health, education, and social protection; as well as the water and urban sectors, focused on water supply, sanitation, wastewater, and solid waste management. Prelim inary countries identified to participate in the TA are Bangladesh, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Uzbekistan. As highlighted by the COVID -19 pandemic, safely managed WASH services, as well as hygienic behavior, are fundamental to protect human health from infectious disease outbreaks, said ADB Principal Water Resources Specialist Coral Fernandez Illescas. This technical assistance will therefore support strengthened WASH+H awareness, evidence -based practices, investments, hyg iene behavioral change for COVID -19 infection prevention and control, and impact mitigation in project preparation and implementation. About 3 billion people globally and nearly three -quarters of people in least -developed countries lack basic home handwa shing facilities with water and soap. Globally, almost half of all schools lack handwashing facilities, affecting 900 million school -age children, while 43% of health care facilities lack hand hygiene at points of patient care. Studies consistently show th at increasing knowledge of handwashing, even in settings where access to reliable water supply exists, is not sufficient to motivate behavior change. The TA will make additional resources available to promote infection prevention and control through an eff ective and sustainable WASH+H program, with particular focus on the poor and marginalized. The program will support multi -sector and multi -stakeholder awareness raising, knowledge and capacity building, policy dialogue, and strategy development. This inclu des activities to raise awareness, strengthen capacity, and identify policy gaps and bottlenecks, and recommend measures to address them. ADB is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific, while sustaini ng its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty. From https://www.adb.org/ 12/15/2020 TOP ADB, Far East Horizon to Support COVID -19 Health Care in Rural PRC The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Far East Horizon Limited (FEH) entered a $75 million loan agreement to strengthen the capacity of rural public hospitals and support coronavirus disease (COVID -19) pandemic control in the People's Republic of China. The loan will allow FEH's subsidiary International Far Eastern Leasing Co., Limited (IFEL) to provide finance to rural public hospitals for lease of modern medical equipment. At least 60% of the loan will be used to finance leases for COVID -19 treatment hospitals in rural areas. Hospitals' bank financing activities are often constrained, because banks do not accept medical equipment as collateral. The pandemic has not only added stress to the health care system, but also reduced the availability of long -term financing from commerc ial sources, said ADB's Private Sector Financial Institutions Division Director Christine Engstrom. This funding from ADB will help support long -term lease of health care equipment and promote the expansion of rural health care leasing operations. FEH will also use the loan funds to train frontline staff and promote public awareness on gender -based violence (GBV) in hospitals it operates. An increase of GBV incidence since the COVID -19 breakout has been observed in some countries. \"With the support of A DB, FEH has been able to support more rural public hospitals to upgrade medical equipment, which is undoubtedly a great support for PRC's medical industry during the COVID -19 global pandemic,\" said FEH Executive Director Wang Mingzhe. \"In the future, we ho pe that ADB will join hands with FEH to support China's development in more fields.\" FEH, listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2011, is one of the leading leasing companies in the PRC. Financial leasing, through IFEL, is among the company's core busi nesses, with operations in health care, urban public utilities, culture, tourism, construction, among others. ADB has previously supported FEH to finance rural hospitals in 12 of the least developed PRC provinces.

As the off -counter transaction rate of Chinese banks has exceeded 90 percent and financial services are highly dependent on the internet, cybersecurity needs to be highlighted, said Guo Shuqing, chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commi ssion (CBIRC). Guo made the remarks while delivering a speech at the Singapore Fintech Festival, which runs from Dec. 7 to 12. Fairer market competition will be pursued, as tech giants can use data monopoly advantages to hinder fair competition and obtain excess returns, Guo added. He called for strict monitoring of large companies to prevent them from obstructing the entry of new organizations, collecting data in unusual ways and refusing to share information that should be disclosed. Guo noted that fint ech has developed rapidly in China and the digital transformation of financial institutions accelerated with more products and tools, improving the efficiency of financial services. China has also learned lessons in handling challenges brought about by fin tech, he said. The number of Chinese peer -to-peer (P2P) lenders had fallen to zero by mid -November from a peak of about 5,000 due to the country's ongoing efforts to crack down on risky forms of financing.

From http://www.new s.cn/ 12/28/2020 TOP JAPAN: Greenhouse Gas Emissions Fall in FY2019 for 6th Straight Year Japan's greenhouse gas emissions fell in fiscal 2019 for the sixth straight year to reach their lowest level since comparable data became available in fiscal 1990, partly due to the impact of the U.S. -China trade dispute, the Environment Ministry said Tuesday. The equivalent of 1,213 million tons of carbon dioxide was emitted in the year through March 2020, down 2.7 percent from a year earlier to rewrite the previous low recorded in fiscal 2018, according to preliminary data. The ministry attributed the drop to declines in production in the steel and other industries affected by the U.S. -China trade war, and expan sions of renewable energy. Under the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, Japan aims to slash greenhouse gas emissions by 26 percent in fiscal 2030 compared with fiscal 2013. With total emissions falling 14 percent in fiscal 2019 from fiscal 2013, the m inistry believes the reduction target is attainable if the current pace of decline in greenhouse gas emissions continues. However, the ministry thinks Japan cannot achieve its longer -term goal of cutting emissions to zero on a net basis by 2050 \"unless all sorts of measures are taken.\" There have been calls for steps such as raising the fiscal 2030 emissions -cut target in order to meet the longer -term goal, which is on a par with pledges by other economies including the European Union and Britain. Prime Mi nister Yoshihide Suga has pledged to establish a fund of 2 trillion yen ($19.2 billion) for firms developing green technologies as part of efforts to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and spur economic growth. In fiscal 2019, electricity consumption by Jap an's steel and machinery industries fell along with a decline in their exports to China, affected by trade disputes between the world's two largest economies. Meanwhile, the share of electricity generated in Japan using renewable sources rose to 18 percent on the back of an increase in solar power. Nuclear power generation accounted for just 6 percent as many nuclear plants remained offline under stricter safety regulations implemented after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster triggered by a massive earthqu ake and tsunami. The ministry said emissions in fiscal 2019 saw almost no impact from the coronavirus outbreak, but called for the need to monitor the situation. From https://japantoday.com 12/09/2020 TOP SOUTH KOREA: To Tighten Grip on Global Internet Giants amid Service Complaints A law revision set to take effect next week will tighten rules for data -hungry internet giants, such as Netflix Inc., amid growing calls for stable services. Earlier this week, the Cabinet passed an amendment to the ordinance of the Telecommunication Business Act, stipulating that online content service providers are responsible for providing stable services to users. The new rules set to take effect Dec. 10 apply to large online service companies, which account for 1 percent or more of the country's total data traffic in the last three months of a year, essentially targeting popular global online service providers Netflix, Google LLC and Facebook Inc. , as well as local players Naver Corp. and Kakao Corp. Should they fail to meet the new rules, they could face an administrative fine of up to 20 million won (US$18,350). The revision comes as global streaming giants Netflix and Google, which operates YouT ube, have recently come under scrutiny over their response to service complaints despite their growing popularity. YouTube faced criticism here after its service went down for hours last month, while a ruling party lawmaker accused Netflix for not properl y responding to service issues in May and June this year during a parliamentary audit in October. All the while, the two companies have boosted their presence in the country. South Koreans are estimated to have spent on average nearly 30 hours on YouTube i n September, according to market tracker IGAWorks. Researcher WiseApp's data showed Netflix's paid subscribers topped 3.6 million in South Korea as of October. Under the new rule change, the companies will have to provide stable services to users regardles s of the devices or ISPs used and take measures to prevent excessive online traffic by working with ISPs, according to the Ministry of Science and ICT. The relatively paltry fine, however, has left some critics wondering about the revision's effectiveness. \"The revision itself has meaning rather than the amount of the fine,\" an ICT ministry official said. \"There hadn't been a way to legally hold these companies accountable for not providing stable services. \"As online content providers have grown in influe nce, there's a need for them to handle greater responsibility,\" he added, explaining that the government is not expecting a string of new violations due to the revision. The extra attention to foreign content providers comes as some ISPs have requested the m to share network costs as their growing popularity leads to a boom in online traffic. Netflix Services Korea Ltd., the Korean unit of the U.S. streaming giant, is currently embroiled in a legal battle with local major ISP SK Broadband Co., arguing that i t has no obligation to pay network usage fees over data traffic. While the new revision doesn't mention network costs and wouldn't impact the current dispute, it could be cited in future legal battles over network cost sharing, the ICT ministry official sa id. Internet industry officials still question the latest rules altogether, arguing that online content providers are already doing all they can for stable services. \"It's questionable what the revision wants to achieve,\" an official at the Korea Internet Corporations Association said. \"Why wouldn't these companies work toward stable services?\" From https://en.yna.co.kr 12/05/2020 TOP S. Korea's Tech Trade at Record High Last Year: Data South Korea's technology trade reached an all -time high of US$31.6 billion last year, up 10.1 percent from 2018, government data showed Tuesday. Technology trade refers to the country's international technology transactions, such as the use of paten ts, licenses and technical services, as opposed to tech products, according to the Ministry of Science and ICT. The ICT ministry said outbound technology transfers amounted to $13.8 billion last year, compared with imports of $17.9 billion, leading to a trade deficit of $4.1 billion that highlights South Korea's reliance on foreign technology. The ratio of tech exports to imports, however, rose last year to 0.77 for the ninth consecutive year from 0.33 in 2010. By country, South Korea had the largest techno logy trade with the United States at $9.8 billion, accounting for 30.9 percent of last year's total. South Korea also had a technology trade deficit of $4.6 billion with the U.S., with ICT ministry data showing that U.S. technology accounted for 40.2 perce nt of South Korea's total inbound technology transfers last year. In terms of technology trade surplus, South Korea had the largest surplus with Vietnam last year at $2.4 billion.

Coordinating Minister for Maritime and Investment Affairs Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan said the number of daily cases and deaths rose after long holidays at the end of October this year, especially in Jakarta, West Ja va, Central Java, East Java, South Sulawesi, North Sumatra, Bali and South Kalimantan. \"Previously, the trend of the cases in these areas had decreased,\" Pandjaitan, concurrently a deputy chairman of the National Committee for the COVID -19 Mitigation and E conomic Recovery, told a meeting with ministers and regional heads on Monday. Every year in Indonesia, there is an exodus of people who work in major cities returning to their villages or towns of origin for family gatherings or just traveling during the C hristmas and year -end holidays. This time, to deal with the exodus during the COVID -19 pandemic, the government has forbidden celebrations and gatherings of more than five people in public areas, and limited hours of service activities. Jakarta's Deputy G overnor Ahmad Riza Patria also emphasized that there would be no year -end celebrations in the capital city this year. The Jakarta administration has also limited operational hours for offices, malls, cafes, restaurants, places of interest and tourist attra ctions to 7:00 p.m. local time with a maximum capacity of 50 percent each. Meanwhile, Jakarta's Governor Anies Baswedan said, \"We want them to remain at home.\" The central government also required people traveling to Jakarta and Yogyakarta province during that period to show negative antigen rapid test results. Bali, which required people only to show rapid test results, now obliges them to bring negative swab test results. In the meantime, South Tangerang city in Banten province does not require rapid anti gen or swab test results, but encouraged the community in the city to strengthen micro -scale social restrictions, Mayor Airin Rachmi Diany said. The South Tangerang administration has also prohibited any gathering and limited the operating hours of malls a nd restaurants to 7:00 p.m. as have been done in the provinces of Lampung, West Java, and North Sulawesi. National COVID -19 Task Force's spokesperson Wiku Adisasmito said the rise in the COVID -19 cases did not only occur during the long weekend last Octob er but also happened after the Eid al -Fitr holidays (Islam's post fasting festivities) in May and the Independence Day vacation in August this year. The spike in the cases could trigger next impacts such as fully occupied hospitals and increases in medical workers' burdens, Adisasmito said. Meanwhile, the occupancy rates of isolation rooms and intensive care units at hospitals in several areas have exceeded 70 percent due to the soaring number of daily COVID -19 cases. Adisasmito noted that the average active cases in December were recorded at 14.39 percent of the total COVID -19 cases, up from 13.78 percent last month.

Reviewing the last three years of the city -wide emulation movement to ensure traffic order and safety and its future tasks, the city's leader emphasised that many civi l servants, public employees, organisation and individuals have contributed to the movement. He said that the city should promote IT application in traffic management and operation to help detect and handle traffic violations. The city plans to mobilise re sources to invest in major transport projects, focusing on inter -regional road projects and improving the efficiency of inland waterways and railways, he noted. Tr n Quang L\u00e2 m, director of the city's Department of Transport, said the movement has achieved positive results, contributing to reducing the number of traffic accidents, fatalities and injuries. Compared with figures in the previous year, the number of traffic accidents fell by 10.5 per cent, deaths by 4 per cent, and injured victims by nearly 29 p er cent in 2018. In 2019, the number of traffic accidents fell by 5.5 per cent, deaths by 10.3 per cent, and injured victims by 2.7 per cent. In the first nine months of the year, the number of traffic accidents dropped by 13.8 per cent and deaths by 14.1 per cent, while the number of injured victims decreased by 12.4 per cent, compared with the same period last year. Fifty -seven traffic works worth more than VN11 trillion (US$474.6 million) were completed and put into use. These new works will help reduc e traffic jams in hotspots such as areas around T\u00e2n Sn Nh t International Airport in T\u00e2 n B\u00ec nh District, C\u00e1 t L\u00e1 i Port in District 2, and the access road to HCM City - Long Th\u00e0 nh - Du Gi\u00e2y Expressway between HCM City and ng Nai Province. Last year, the c ity opened the first phase of a smart traffic monitoring and operation centre, the first of its kind in the country applying modern technology to traffic management. The BusMap app, which has information on public bus routes and bus arrival times, has attracted more than 870,000 downloads. The city has also begun trial use of e -tickets on public buses, and installed automatic payment systems on 162 buses on 62 bus routes. In addition, parking fees on 23 streets are collected automatically through MyParking or ViettelPay apps on drivers' smart devices. Roadblocks Despite these measures, the increasing number of private vehicles is putting pressure on the city's transport infrastructure. Illegal parking areas and street -side vendors continue to encroach upon sidewalks and roads, and lack adequate supervision and inspection. Phong asked State management offices to improve management activities to ensure traffic order and safety. Research on urban traffic management models suited to the city's current situation should be completed. And, solutions are needed to eliminate so -called black spots where traffic accidents and congestion occur regularly in the city, he said. More attention should also be paid to improving the quality of public transport services and cont rol the number of personal vehicles in urban areas. The second phase of the smart traffic monitoring and operation centre is expected to be completed by 2025.

From https://vietnamnews.vn 12/28/2020 TOP South Asia INDIA: Need Faster Ways to Absorb Innovation in Govt SOPs This word Innovation' is misunderstood at times as many bureaucrats and other constituents feel that unless there is a huge change, it's not an innovation. And, in such a complexity many times improvements do not take place, Ranjan Dwivedi, Former Director General of Police, Uttar Pradesh, opened his address on this note. He added, We see many officers make good innovations, however, the process of governance is such that if you want to change a rule it is a long process. The problem of rule changing or rulemaking does really steps in while absor bing the innovations and changes. The governance has been designed in this way to ensure that even if someone makes changes to it no harm is caused, cited Dwivedi. Essentially all these improvements indicate changes in the rules of business. Some are reen gineering workplaces and some are reengineering processes, however, everything follows a written procedure. Governments function as per certain standard operating procedures (SOPs). Therefore, what the government leaders, policymakers must look at is how t o absorb innovations and corrective changes in the SOPs in the fastest manner possible to avoid unnecessary delays, Dwivedi deliberated. Further, he said, With the inclusion of IT technologies, bringing changes in the procedures shall be eased... We should have the latest and the authentic version on the web and quoting the URL then becomes the latest version and not the official version. If such changes are introduced then it will become easier to absorb new innovations that the young officers are making, he added. Shedding light on the way forward for the governance, he said, The future of e-governance and the use of ICT for governance was always bright. However, the adoption of ICT has been very slow. One of the reasons is that the bureaucracy is extrem ely conservative... I would say that only 45 to 50 per cent have been achieved of hat we could have achieved. On the impact of COVID pandemic on the governance, Dwivedi highlighted, COVID has been a blessing in disguise. We see that there is a deadly pande mic with which we have to fight, however, in that silver cloud, there are so many silver linings. Citing an example of technologies augmenting governance, he said that earlier we had to submit live forms and that as no easy task. But, since the onset of C OVID, one can now apply online, get formalities done within a few clicks and gets the service delivered at the doorstep. Contradicting his example above, he said, But not all is so good. Ther are services where one can apply online but then has to visit t he office for further formalities like for the vehicle registration certificate, one has to visit or take the vehicle to the authority. However, it should be in a way that if I apply only submit the required documents online then there should be no need fo r me to physically visit an office. So, we're halfway through. Concluding his address, Dwivedi pointed out, Without bringing change and reengineering the business procedures, we cannot completely establish the e -governance or technology -based solutions. So, the government has to find out an easier way to change the rule book to absorb innovative solutions as soon as possible.

From http://egov.eletsonline.com 12/04/2020 TOP PM Modi Launches India's First Driverless Metro in DelhiElets In a significant leap make urban development future -ready and placing a new benchmark of growth and development, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated India's first -ever driverless metro train on Delhi Metro Rail Corporation's (DMRC) Mage nta Line on December 28 via video conferencing. The PM also announced the expansion of National Common Mobility Card to the Airport Express Line of Delhi Metro. Union Minister of State for Housing and Urban Affairs, Hardeep Singh Puri and Chief Minister of Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal were also present on the occasion. Addressing the occasion, PM Modi termed the inaugural event as an attempt to make urban development future -ready. He said preparing the country for future needs is an important responsibility of go vernance. He lamented the fact that a few decades ago, when the demand of urbanisation was felt, there was not much attention given to the needs of the future, half -hearted work was done and confusion persisted. Unlike this, modern thinking says that urban isation should not be seen as a challenge but used as an opportunity to build better infrastructure in the country, an opportunity through which we can enhance Ease of Living. This difference of thinking is seen now in every dimension of urbanization, adde d the PM. In 2014, only 5 cities had metro rail service and today, metro rail is available in 18 cities. By the year 2025, we are going to expand it to more than 25 cities. Today the metro covers over 700 km of distance which is thrice more than the 248 km of coverage in 2014. By the year 2025, we are trying to expand it to 1700 km said PM Modi. The Prime Minister remarked that the government formulated the metro policy for the first time and implemented it with an all -round strategy. Emphasis was on worki ng according to local demand, promoting local standards, Make in India expansion and use of modern technology. He said it was noted that the expansion of the metro, modern modes of transport should be used according to the needs of the people of the city a nd the professional lifestyle there. This is the reason why work is being done on different types of metro rail in different cities. Listing out the different types of metro rail works being carried out, PM Modi said, on the Regional Rapid Transit System ( RRTS) between Delhi and Meerut will reduce the distance of Delhi and Meerut to less than an hour. He said in cities where passenger numbers are less, work is being done on the MetroLite version. MetroLite version would be constructed at 40 per cent cost of normal metro. He further added that Metro Neo is being worked in cities where the ridership is less. It would be built at the cost of 25 per cent of the normal metro. Similarly, water metro would be an out of the box thinking. For cities where there are l arge water bodies, the water metro is now being worked on. This will provide last -mile connectivity to the people near the islands. The PM said the metro today is no longer just a medium of public transport but a great way to reduce pollution. Thousands of vehicles have been reduced from the road due to the metro network, which used to cause pollution and traffic jams. Further, he said that for the expansion of metro services, Make in India is important. Make in India reduces costs, saves foreign exchange, and gives more employment to people in the country itself. He stressed that standardisation of rolling stock has reduced the cost of every coach from Rs 12 crore to Rs 8 crore now. Today, four big companies are manufacturing metro coaches in the country an d dozens of companies are engaged in the manufacturing of metro components. This is helping Make in India as well as the campaign for self -reliant India. With the achievement of driverless metro rail, our country has joined the select countries of the wor ld where such facilities are available. He said a braking system in which 50 per cent of the energy goes back into the grid when the brakes are applied are being used. Today 130 MW of solar power is being used in metro rail, which will be increased to 600 MW. Speaking on the Common Mobility Card, the PM said that providing the same standards and facilities for modernisation is very important. The Common Mobility Card at the national level is a major step in this direction. This one card will give integrated access to the commuters wherever they travel, whichever public transport they take. With this, he dwelled on the process of consolidating all the systems. Through such consolidation of systems, the strength of the country is being harnessed in a more coor dinated and efficient way.

From https://www.lankabusinessonline.com/ 12/01/2020 TOP Blockchain Power Land Registry Real Estate is one of the largest markets/industries in the world. In 2018, Real Estate market transactions reached $1.75 trillion. It is important to note that behind each of these transactions there was a land registry paper trail. The issue is that land registry systems, in most parts of the world, have also become such mundane administrative matter where it is still being performed manually. There are various challenges when it comes to land registry process. Historical records of lands and properties were recorded on paper documents. Although some first world countries have since welcomed digita l records, many countries, such as Sri Lanka, still perform such activities on paper documents. There are cases where the paper title deeds were damaged or lost and registering the property again has become a cumbersome activity. It would then become extre mely difficult to claim the ownership of the land. Therefore, it is safer to argue that manual paper -based land registry system is failing! This is where the EFutures' Blockchain -Powered Landy Registry prototype comes into the picture. While everyone agree s that land registries must go digital, the question is, why Blockchain? In a nutshell, Blockchain can provide highly secure records of ownership that cannot be manipulated. A Blockchain system is decentralized, therefore there is no one single point of en try for any cyber -attacks. Unlike traditional databases, Blockchain technology can record and maintain historical information at ease. The technology is also renowned for its abilities to provide secure environments for transactions between multiple partie s. Some of the main features of the system is mentioned above in the photo. In the current application, there are three main user types. They are Admin Users who are authorized to manage properties, owners, buyers and transaction, propery owners, who are a llowed to update property details, manage documents and also to transfer properties and finally buyers, who have access to the property list and obtain available properties. The system allows users to register themselves in the application while the authe ntication is carried out by a third -party service provider. Moreover, each user gets his/her Blockchain wallet in the application where the transactions are performed. The application not only contains existing properties and lands, but it also has the abi lity to create new properties and the function is restricted to authorized admin users. These properties are listed in a virtual map and colour -graded to identify properties that are available and properties that are already occupied. If a buyer desires to purchase certain property and the seller is willing to transfer the property, the transaction can be carried out seamlessly through a fast verification process and the propery is obtained by the buyer in no time. All the transaction activities are recorde d and the history is maintained in a decentralized Blockchain system. Therefore, ownership verification is accurate and super fast while the data cannot be altered or damaged. The application has plans to expand beyond the current set of users and authorit ies. The application will be open for financial institutions, tax authorities and conveyancers in the future. Financial institutions will gain access to the system and able to obtain relevant information. This will be helpful in an event of granting a hous ing loan or any financial aid for potential buyers of property. On the other hand, tax authorities will gain access to the system so they can monitor transactions in order to maintain proper taxable records. Finally, conveyancers will also gain access to t he system in the future where they will be allowed to carry out various legal procedures.

The organization of the development of the agricultural sector, the efficient use of land, the creation of agricultural cooperatives as a form of joint farming to increase the income of farmers are of great importance. By providing significant support to s mall agricultural producers, cooperatives are increasing their access to a variety of services, resources, technology, credit, and supply centers, said the ministrys message. The Strategic Roadmap for the production and processing of agricultural produc ts in of Azerbaijan', approved by the decree #1138 of the President of Azerbaijan dated December 6, 2016, identifies measures to create farmer partnerships and develop cooperation in agriculture. In accordance with the Strategic Roadmap and the State Pro gram for the Development of Agricultural Cooperation in Azerbaijan for 2017 -2022' on the basis of a voluntary association of citizens as a pilot project with the support of the Ministry of Agriculture, the 'Birlik' cooperative was created in the Sabirabad district, consisting of 850 hectares of shared land of 133 families, Akhyskhalar', consisting of 730 hectares of shared land of 231 families, and in the Gakh district - the Atababa Fyndygh' cooperative, consisting of 350 hectares of shared land of 96 fam ilies. In 2019, in a vegetable and seed -growing, Bereket' cooperative was created in the Fuzuli village of the Samukh district. Meanwhile, in the village of Saryjalar of the Saatli district - Bollug' production cooperative, and in the village of Isnov G yshlag of the Guba district - Gyzyl Alma' production and consumer cooperative. As of early 2020, the Sunbul' production cooperative was established in the Agsu district, the Jalilabad' production cooperative was established in the villages of Kazimabad and Garazenjir, in the Goktepe settlement of the Jalilabad district, and in the city of Jalilabad. The creation of cooperatives is considered to be the best way to move agriculture from small -scale production to competitive production, increase productiv ity through the use of innovative technologies, and provide access to foreign markets. The ministry continues to take measures in this direction. In Jalilabad district, it is planned to create a cooperative for growing strawberries, in Lankaran district - rice and tea, Khachmaz district - cherry, in Barda and Aghjabadi districts - cotton, Goychay district - persimmons, Zagatala district - tea, Astara district - citrus fruits, in Hajigabul and Aghdash districts - cooperatives for the production of grain.

A carbon credit is a permit that allows the company that holds it to emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases. For the development of the forestry industry in Uzbekistan, it is planned to reconstruct and replenish walnut, almond and pistachio forests with high -yielding varieties and the creation of industrial plantations. In addition, State Forestry Committee plans to expand the provision of natural regeneration and creation of tugai forests, plantations of paulownia and other fast -growing tree species , as well as creation of protective forest plantations in the desert zone, including on the drained bottom of the Aral Sea with modern technologies. The Committee also intends to implement projects on the organization of ecological tourism, expanding the r ange of cultivated medicinal plants, and the processing of forest products and products of secondary forest use. In cooperation with the private sectors, the Committee is aimed to develop the production of beekeeping, poultry, livestock, and other food pro ducts. \"In 2021 -2024 the Committee plans to implement a full -scale \"Sustainable management of forests and pastures in arid ecosystems of Uzbekistan\" project for the amount of $4.3 million,\" Umarov said. The expert also noted a national action plan to comba t desertification and drought in 2023 in Uzbekistan. From https://en.trend.az/ 12/04/2020 TOP Oceania AUSTRALIA: Electronic Surveillance Set for Overhaul Australia's electronic surveillance laws are set for an overhaul after the Morrison government agreed to the recommendations of a landmark intelligence report. Former intelligence chief Dennis Richardson's 1300 -page report found the existing framework was unnecessarily complex a nd outpaced by technology. Attorney -General Christian Porter expects the surveillance reforms to take up to 18 months to draft. \"That in itself would be perhaps the biggest national security legislative project in recent history,\" he told reporters in Canb erra on Friday. \"It would require the repeal and rewriting of nearly 1000 pages of existing law on warrants, interception and telecommunications.\" The report found law enforcement and intelligence were being challenged by criminals going under the radar th rough new technologies. It referenced the dark web, encryption, cryptocurrency, messaging apps, social media and multiple data storage platforms. Mr Porter said despite the scale and pace of technological change, the old regime had been durable over time. \"The conclusion that Dennis Richardson reaches is that it is no longer fit for purpose in the digital world of internet smart phones and end -to-end encryption,\" he said. The attorney -general said the report found key principles underpinning Australia's intelligence and security legislation were sound. The government also agreed to implementing a new framework for ASIO's offshore activities in order to strengthen ministerial accountability. More oversight will be included in intelligence legislation and e mergency warrants streamlined. But Richardson report recommended against putting a \"double lock\" system for additional approvals across the warrant system. An independent panel will be established to provide assistance to the inspector -general of intellig ence and security. The government has agreed to 186 of the 190 unclassified recommendations. Mr Richardson also produced a classified version of the report. Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton, who is responsible for domestic security agencies, said legisla ted powers must keep up with new technologies in order to keep people safe. \"The threat of violent extremists is still with us. These people are still plotting and planning to kill Australians and we need to make sure that legislation we have in place is f it for purpose,\" he told reporters in Canberra. From https://au.news.yahoo.com 12/04/2020 TOP Labor Launches Childcare Fee Calculator Anthony Albanese is launching a childcare calculator he says will help families find out how much cheaper their fees would be under a Labor government. Mr Albanese says one million families would be better off under his party's alternative plans for early education. Labor is promising to scrap the $10,560 childcare subsidy cap, lift the maximum rate to 90 per cent, and increase the taper rate to families earning less than $530,000. Mr Albanese says Labor's plan would make child care more affordable for 97 per cent of families in the syste m and remove disincentives for second income earners, predominantly women, to work full time. He says it will also remove financial barriers to more than 100,000 families locked out of the childcare system. \"Labor has put forward a plan for cheaper child c are that is win, win, win - it is good for parents, good for children, and good for the economy,\" Mr Albanese said on Monday. From https://au.news.yahoo.com 12/07/2020 TOP Most Want Masks Worn on Public Transport Seventy per cent of Australians think face masks should be mandatory on public transport and almost 90 per cent believe there's a moderate to high risk of COVID -19 transmission on transport networks. Tourism and Transport Forum research released on Monday found the number of commuters travelling on public transport - particularly during the national lockdown from March through to May - dropped to between 10 to 30 per cent of normal activity in capital cities. TTF CEO Margy Osmond said COVID -19 had a massive impact on travel patterns and the effects had continued beyond the national lockdown. \"Safety concerns have been the major barrier to getting back to pre -COVID -19 patronage levels on the network along with significant numbers of employees still working from home,\" Ms Osmond said. Almost 90 per cent of Australian businesses required staff to work from home during the initial lockdown. Australian Bureau of Statistics data in May showed 59 per cent of people felt uncomfortable travelling to work by public transport as restrictions started to ease. That trend continuing after the second wave and more extreme lockdown in Victoria and other small outbreaks in NSW and South Australia. Some 86 per cent said they believed there was a moderate to high risk of COVID -19 transmission on the transport network. A further 71 per cent of respondents supported a mandatory requirement to wear face masks on public transport. And almost 75 per cent of people working from home preferre d to work that way. Mask wearing is compulsory on public transport in Victoria but the NSW government has resisted calls to mandate it although it strongly recommends travellers do so. \"These issues will continue to challenge policymakers along with the l onger -term implications of the changing face of the workplace and new travel patterns become established,\" Ms Osmond said. The report was produced by TTF using data supplied by LEK Consulting and a national consumer survey of 2300 Australians conducted by MI Associates. From https://au.news.yahoo.com 12/07/2020 TOP Australia Tightens International Borders Air crews and diplomats entering Australia will face tougher coronavirus rules while more seasonal workers could come to the country under a new federal -state deal. Scott Morrison on Friday chaired the final national cabinet meeting for the year in Canberra, with state and territory leaders meeting in person for the first time since the pandemic hit. Premiers and chief ministers agreed to more stringent checks for diplomats and airline staff arriving in Australia. \"These are the vulnerabilities that I wouldn't say are on a great scale but they're important vulnerabil ities,\" Mr Morrison told reporters. \"As the year goes on and as our success continues, the states and territories become even more laser -like focused on the areas where potential vulnerabilities can emerge.\" The federal government will provide special seas onal worker visas that confine people to states in which they have agreed to be employed. The prime minister praised the success of Queensland in allowing agricultural workers to quarantine on farms, signalling similar arrangements could be in place across other jurisdictions. But NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian was adamant hotel quarantine would continue rather than allowing other isolation options. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said his state's horticulture industry needed more labour to guarantee crops could be harvested and sold to shoppers at an affordable price. \"We have to find a way forward here. We need 15,000 to 20,000 workers and no hotel quarantine system will be able to cope with that,\" he said. He said Victoria would learn from Queensla nd and was in discussion with federal health authorities about establishing safe travel bubbles with other countries. The prime minister said allowing Australians to return home remained the chief priority ahead of seasonal workers or international student s. \"There are physical limitations on the hotel quarantine capacity but that is the safest and most effective way for people to come home and quarantine,\" he said. There are almost 39,000 Australians stranded overseas wanting to return home, with the numb er growing in recent months. Mr Morrison argues 46,000 people have made it back to Australia since he made a mid -September commitment to return the 26,200 people who were on the list by Christmas. National cabinet was briefed on a vaccination rollout after an Australian -developed candidate was scrapped following false positives for HIV. The prime minister said the country remained on track for immunisations to begin in the first three months of next year through deals for other vaccines. Friday marked the f irst seven -day period without any community transmission of coronavirus in Australia since February 29. WA Premier Michael McGowan attended national cabinet virtually because his government has rules against mixing with South Australians. From https://au.news.yahoo.com 12/11/2020 TOP Asia -Pacific G20 Alliance Will Conduct 'Smart City' Research Around the World Chattanooga is one of two U.S. cities invited to join the 2020 G20 Global Smart Cities Alliance, a group of 36 cities from 22 countries. Work organized through the Center for Urban Informatics and Progress (CUIP) at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga is the main reason the city was selected, according to the alliance. San Jose, California, is the other U.S. city invited to join. Created in June 2019, the alliance brings together cities that are pioneers exploring solutions on issues of energy, transportation, health care, education and others with the ultimate goals of, among others, improving quality of life, environmental sustainabilit y and financial transparency in each city. Members of the alliance trade successful ideas that address these dilemmas, designing a roadmap of policies that everyone can use. Chattanooga's Smart City initiative examines and tests everything from traffic f low and electricity delivery to air quality and safety issues. The research is centered at CUIP and its partners. At UTC, we are excited about being part of the Chattanooga team that was given the opportunity by the World Economic Forum to pioneer smart -city technologies, said Reinhold Mann, the University's deputy vice chancellor for research. The city began its Smart City work in 2010 with the creation of EPB's fiber -optic internet system, making Chattanooga the first U.S. city to offer high -speed inte rnet access to every resident. After CUIP was created in 2018, its research projects include improving traffic flow to lower the amount of automobile pollution in the city, reduce the number of vehicle accidents and make streets safer for pedestrians and c yclists. Working with grants from the U.S. Department of Energy and U.S. Department of Transportation, CUIP has partnered with Vanderbilt University and the Chattanooga Area Regional Transportation Authority (CARTA) to examine ways to bring public transpor tation to underserved neighborhoods and address other public transportation issues. CUIP also established a Smart Community Collaborative that focuses on initiatives in health, transportation and energy. CUIP has won several national and international awa rds for its research. Chattanooga offers much in the areas of collaboration, entrepreneurship and innovation, Chattanooga's Smart City Director Kevin Comstock told SmartCitiesDive.comDrive, but there is still a lot to be learned by partnering with others around the world. The palette is infinite for smart city activities, he said on the website. Market research firm Frost & Sullivan predicts that global smart cities 4Economic and S ocial Development and ICT may spur $2.46 trillion in business opportunities by 2025 as long as cities have the capabilities and policies to implement those ideas. From https://blog.utc.edu/ 12/05/2020 TOP Smart Cities and Their Implications on Privacy Any city capable of using information and communication technologies to create efficiency, sustainability, and improve the quality of its citizens can be described as a smart city. However, smart cities are still a fairly young concept and the definition of what constitutes a smart city is still evolving. Current global population trends point to a gradual shift in the residence of the human population from rural to urban areas, which makes smart cities all the more important. At the moment, more than 50 percent of the global popula tion lives in cities. The global urban population is projected to rise to nearly 70 percent over the next few decades. A growing urban population creates issues such as congestion, high energy consumption, waste disposal problems, food scarcity, and inequa lity. Smart city technology will be pivotal in managing these and other challenges as our cities swell. Here are some global smart city trends and their respective benefits. Big Data One of the biggest trends in smart city technology is leveraging big dat a to improve the quality of life in cities. Advancements in big data and technologies such as IoT (Internet of Things) has allowed city authorities access to vast amounts of information. IoT and big data facilitate data -driven decision -making in energy and resource management which, in turn, cuts costs and improves service delivery to city residents. Smart Buildings High energy consumption is one of the challenges caused by growing urban populations. Smart cities are making an effort to reduce their carbon footprint through smart buildings. Smart buildings use renewable energy resources, air -quality sensors, and energy -efficient buildings to reduce adverse effects on the environment. Some smart buildings can even generate their own electricity to save resou rces and help sustainability. Smart Transportation Cities around the world are increasingly implementing smart transportation networks to solve the problem of traffic congestion and provide efficient transportation services. More congestion in our cities leads to more pollution. Reducing traffic congestion saves time, reduces energy consumption, and results in cleaner air. A smart transportation system also comes with great economic benefits. Cutting -edge technological innovations make smart cities more ef ficient, more effective, and are necessary given these projections. Connectivity Smart cities are digitally connected through city -wide Wi -Fi connections, wireless CCTV cameras, etc. These technologies create a positive impact on the life of residents acr oss the board. Cities can strategically place public Wi -Fi hotspots throughout the city to provide reliable internet service to all city residents and increase digital equity. CCTV cameras make our cities safer by making it easier to catch criminals. Privacy Concerns in Smart Cities The major area of concern with smart city technology is the massive data collection and its implication on the privacy of city residents. Smart cities rely on massive data collection and analysis. The data collected by smart ci ties poses certain privacy risks to the resident. There's always the possibility of misuse. Many have expressed concerns about the potential of smart city technology in mass surveillance and a gradual transition to a surveillance state. So, what can be don e to protect the citizens' right to privacy? The Future of Smart Cities The more connected a city is, the greater the risk to the residents' individual privacy. In addition to surveillance, there are other issues surrounding smart cities and their data co llection practices. Personal data is a valuable resource in the information economy. The data harvested by city authorities as well as private companies enlisted to implement smart city projects could be stolen. Vast amounts of detailed information are par ticularly appealing for hackers. The fact that this information is centralized and connected to the internet makes it even more susceptible to attacks. Often, data collected by cities contains enough information for hackers to steal their identity or execu te scams. Cities should ensure that data collected is adequately secured by ensuring proper controls from the outset. Private companies handling the data should also strive to make sure that data is anonymized where possible. What Can You Do to Improve Pr ivacy? There are certain steps city residents can take to protect their data at an individual level. For instance, make sure you know the best cybersecurity hygiene practices, such as using a VPN when connected to public Wi -Fi networks in the city. A Virtu al Private Network (VPN) is a service designed to help you establish a secure internet connection and maintain internet privacy. It encrypts your internet traffic and hides it from your ISP and the government. If you are concerned about privacy, simply download a VPN to ensure security when you connect to city Wi -Fi hotspots. Final Thoughts The global urban population is on the rise. Smart city development projects are harnessing the power of information and communication technology to manage the difficult ies of swelling cities. Smart city technology can improve the quality of life of city residents in a myriad of ways. However, there are legitimate concerns that the vast amounts of data collected by smart cities heighten the risk to individual privacy. Fortunately, certain precautions can be taken at both individual and city levels to guarantee privacy.

In the United States, Japan and Canada, the CLIs point to s table growth. In France, Italy, and more tentatively Germany, the CLIs show signs of moderating growth. In the United Kingdom, where there is heightened uncertainty around the prospect of a trade deal with the EU being concluded before the end of the year, the CLI contracted for the third straight month. Among major emerging economies, the CLI for the manufacturing sector of China is improving steadily. This is also now the assessment for Brazil. In India, the CLI continues to rise but at a moderating pace, while in Russia growth of the CLI has stabilised. Whilst the impact of renewed COVID -19 containment measures has been largely incorporated into the forward -looking indicators used to construct the CLI estimates, the more recent positive news concerning va ccine developments may not be. As such, this month's CLIs should continue to be interpreted with care. Visit the interactive OECD Data Portal to explore this data further. The above graph show country specific composite leading indicators (CLIs solid line, left axis and the relative month -on-month growth rate, right axis).

As the world emerges from the pandemic, we must revive our regional cooperation effo rts with a spirit of open regionalism to enable CAREC to seize the opportunities of renewed globalization, said ADB President Masatsugu Asakawa in his keynote address. This means expanding connectivity, rejuvenating trade, and embracing innovation and te chnology in ways that put the people of the CAREC region at its center. There is huge potential for adopting technologies that improve the monitoring of cross -border health threats, enable the use of telemedicine and online education, and raise food safety standards \u2014while the private sector can play a crucial role as a driver of innovation. The virtual event, under the theme \"People -Centered Regional Cooperation in the Post-COVID Environment,\" was attended by President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan , ministers and senior officials from the 11 CAREC countries, and representatives from development partners. The event was hosted by the Government of Afghanistan. Finance Minister of Afghanistan Abdul Hadi Arghandiwal chaired the meeting and ADB Vice -President Shixin Chen co -chaired. Regional connectivity is one of the top priorities of our economic development agenda, said Mr. Ghani in his special address. The CAREC platform can help us fully integrate the infrastructure, systems, and programs, and sha re our common cultural values. The CAREC Program is a proactive facilitator of practical, results -based regional projects and policy initiatives critical to sustainable economic growth and shared prosperity in the region. As a high -level strategy and po licy body, CAREC is a partnership for its 11 members to promote economic growth and sustainable development through cooperation. Since its inception in 2001, the program has financed 208 regional infrastructure and trade projects worth $39.2 billion. Proje cts have, for example, helped increase road and railway efficiency, streamline border -crossings, and improve access to energy for millions of people in the region. Of the total, $14.7 billion has been financed by ADB, $15.8 billion by other development par tners, and $8.7 billion by CAREC member governments. CAREC ministers unanimously endorsed two new long -term strategies: a tourism strategy to develop safe and sustainable tourism destinations and provide jobs in CAREC countries; and a gender strategy to im prove access to economic opportunities for women and empower them in decision -making processes. In a joint statement, the ministers commended CAREC's efforts to address the challenges posed by the pandemic and reaffirmed their commitment to regional cooperation and support for CAREC's Strategy 2030. The ministers noted substantial progress in CAREC's five priority areas, welcomed the forthcoming digital strategy to integrate information and communication technology into each priority area, and highlig hted the continued financial and technical support of development partners. Investments in the CAREC region in 2020 have further strengthened regional connectivity, including a new project to expand energy trade between Afghanistan and Uzbekistan and provi de 500,000 households and businesses with reliable access to electricity. The program also completed a study on regional health cooperation, identifying opportunities to mitigate the spread of diseases and improve health services for migrants and border co mmunities. ADB is the secretariat of the CAREC Program. The 11 members of CAREC are Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, the People's Republic of China, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. From https://www.adb.org/ 12/07/2020 TOP COVID -19 and the Wellbeing of Older Persons in Asia Asia's population is rapidly aging, a trend that predates the ongoing pandemic. As COVID -19 does disproportionate harm to the elderly \u2014particularly those with pre-existing health problems \u2014ensuring the wellbeing of older persons in the region is even more urgent. Asia's policy makers need to know how seniors in the region are faring in this pandemi c, how they can be protected from the worst aspects of the disease, and what can be done to support them. Even as economies return to normal after the pandemic, the region will face the question of how best to promote healthy and active aging. A panel of e xperts describes how the pandemic is impacting the physical health, mental health, and economic security of older persons in Asia and the Pacific and discusses the needs of older persons and the extent to which these needs are addressed by country systems in the context of the pandemic. The role of government policy in promoting active and healthy aging in times of the COVID -19 and its aftermath is also examined. From https://www.adb.org/ 12/14/2020 TOP Health, Social Protection to Underpin Sustainable Recovery from COVID -19 Growth in the Pacific subregion for 2020 has been further downgraded as the impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID -19) pandemic continues to squeeze the regi on's economies. The Asian Development Bank's (ADB) Pacific Economic Monitor launched today has downgraded the Pacific's growth for this year to a contraction of 6.1%, down from the 4.3% decline forecast in July. It will be a balancing act to keep Pacific economies moving during the COVID -19 recovery period, said ADB Director General for the Pacific Leah Gutierrez. Vaccine procurement and distribution, safe travel arrangements, and continuing to strengthen health and social protection systems will all be key to ensuring the region's recovery is sustainable. Although the ADB report says the Pacific subregion is expected to post a cautious recovery in 2021 with growth of 1.3%, that will depend on how quickly travel and trade restrictions can be lifted to al low for some revival in economic activity. As Fiji waits for tourism to resume, ADB projects the country's economy to contract by 19.8% in 2020 and may only achieve a minimal recovery of 1.0% in 2021, assuming tourists return in the second half of the year . The pandemic has heavily impacted Papua New Guinea's economy, which is forecast to contract by 2.9% in 2020. Some recovery is projected in 2021, but growth is expected to remain low at 2.5%, reflecting the lingering impacts of the pandemic. The Monitor says a prudent expenditure strategy will be key for the recovery period. Articles in the Monitor look at how the tourism -dependent economies, such as the Cook Islands, are managing the economic impacts of COVID -19. Even if borders were to reopen in the Coo k Islands at the beginning of next year, ADB anticipates GDP there will decline by 15.4% in 2021. The contraction is expected to impact employment and household incomes, particularly for women who hold 60% of tourism -related jobs. In Niue, a potential trav el bubble with New Zealand could help alleviate the fiscal strains of a prolonged pause in international travel. For Palau, measures including tax and state -owned enterprise reforms, and prioritizing capital spending, will help the economy better weather t he COVID -19 storm. In Vanuatu, the government responded to the impacts of COVID -19 and Cyclone Harold with strong health and economic stimulus measures. However, fiscal pressures appear to be mounting for 2021. In Samoa and Tonga, remittances may provide an opportunity to alleviate domestic economic pressures. Ultimately, expanding seasonal worker schemes would substantially alleviate economic pressures. For Solomon Islands, beyond the immediate fiscal response to the pandemic, targeted efforts will be nee ded to improve fiscal buffers, and ensure that revenue mobilization is efficient. The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) and the Marshall Islands have been more affected by the socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic than initially estimated. The ADB repor t says measures to safeguard public health, provide training and education, and protect the vulnerable will help those countries avoid the spread of the disease and lay the foundations for a strong and sustainable economic recovery. The Monitor says the pr iorities for Nauru are to ensure critical services are efficiently delivered and private sector activities are not adversely affected. For Kiribati and Tuvalu, geographical remoteness, isolation, and dispersion create additional hurdles for the government to respond. A stronger information base on vulnerable groups can help ensure social assistance measures are better targeted during crisis periods. The Monitor's policy briefs examine key issues that have critical implications for the Pacific's broader eco nomic recovery from the COVID -19 crisis. A case study looks at how data from the latest census in the FSM helped the country to mount a gender -inclusive response to COVID -19. A survey of COVID -19 response packages across the subregion highlights how the Pa cific has prioritized social protection to mitigate the pandemic's most severe impacts on the vulnerable. Another policy brief presents an initial analysis of the potential cost -effectiveness of a COVID -19 vaccine in select Pacific economies. A contributio n from the Lowy Institute examines trends in health spending and foreign aid in the Pacific, as well as the potential impacts of the COVID -19 crisis on health financing moving forward. From https://www.adb.org/ 12/15/2020 TOP Asia's Water Security - The Glass Is Still Half Full Managing water resources effectively is becoming increasingly critical in Asia and the Pacific, with its fast -paced economic development, population grow th, and changing climate. Accelerating urbanization means that about 2.5 billion people or more than half of the region's population, will be living in urban areas by 2030. The region is home to about 563 million urban slum dwellers, challenging municipali ties' abilities to provide basic services. At the same time, agriculture is expanding with irrigated smallholder farms receiving on average 80% of Asia's freshwater. The Asian Water Development Outlook (AWDO), a flagship periodical publication by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Asia -Pacific Water Forum, describes in detail the water security status of Asia and the Pacific since 2007 and highlights critical water management issues facing the region. This 2020 fourth edition provides is strongly aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals. Serious water constraints As AWDO 2020 describes, despite the economic and development achievements in Asia and the Pacific (home to 60% of the world's population), about 300 million in the region still have no access to safely managed or basic water services such as drinking water, and 1.2 billion lack adequate sanitation. Poor access to water and sanitation disproportionally impacts vulnerable groups, who are particularly susceptible to external economic shocks and infectious diseases such as the coronavirus disease (COVID -19). Of the 49 ADB members from Asia and the Pacific, 27 face serious water constraints on economic development, and 18 are yet to sufficiently protect their inhabitants against water -related disasters. Asia and the Pacific is the most disaster -affected region in the world, home to more than 40% of disasters and 84% of people affected. Major cities along the coastlines are becoming increasingly vulnerable to climate change risks and disasters \u2014flood events, sea-level rise, and droughts \u2014threatening lives, livelihoods, and public health and generating huge economic losses. Over the last few decades, Asia and the Pacific has achieved impressive economic growth and gains social welfare with a tangib le increase in water security, says Tom Panella, Chief of ADB's Water Sector Group, tasked with producing this fourth edition of AWDO. Integrated water resources management, good governance and human capital development remain vital to support inclusive economic growth and increase overall social well -being in Asia and the Pacific, especially in the wake of COVID -19. Tracking water security Water security as defined in AWDO 2020 is the availability of an adequate quantity and quality of water to ensure safe, affordable, equitable and inclusive water supply and sanitation together with sustainable livelihoods and healthy ecosystems and manageable water -related risks. Operationalizing water security will help foster resilient rural -urban economies in Asia and the Pacific. The AWDO measures water security across five key dimensions (KDs) \u2014rural household water security, economic water security, urban water security, environmental water security, and water -related disaster security. Water security is expressed in scores, calculated for each KD based on publicly available data on various indicators. The scores of all five KDs are added to form the multidimensional national water security score. Based on the aggregated scores, five key stages of national water se curity were identified progressively from nascent up to engaged, capable, effective, and model. Key findings of AWDO National Water Security. The number of ADB members in the nascent and engaged stages cumulatively decreased from 30 to 22, while the numbe r of ADB members in the capable and effective stages increased from 19 to 27. This reflects an overall upward trend for the region. KD1: Rural Household Water Security. All regions show steady progress in improving rural household water security. East Asia and Southeast Asia perform well, while Pacific and South Asia lag behind. Twenty -three ADB members are still in the nascent and engaged stages (compared with 28 in 2013). The number of ADB members in the effective and model stages has increased from 7 to 13. KD2: Economic Water Security. All other regions also show good progress except the Pacific, where eight ADB members are still in the nascent stage. With 32 ADB members still in the nascent and engaged stages, 2.1 billion people face serious limitations in their economic activities due to insufficient water management. KD3: Urban Water Security. The level of urban water security has remained about the same during 2013 -2020. Urban water security in East Asia has nearly reached the same level as the adva nced economies. The Pacific region is lagging. Seven ADB members are still in the nascent stage, while 18 are in the engaged stage. KD4: Environmental Water Security. KD4 shows a mixed picture. On the one hand, the number of ADB members in the capable and effective stages has increased from 20 in 2013 to 31 in 2020. On the other hand, 18 ADB members are still in the nascent and engaged stages. Southeast Asia scores well and is nearly at the same level as the Advanced Economies, with the Pacific region scori ng above average. South Asia is trailing other regions. KD5: Water -Related Disaster Security. All regions, show good progress in water -related disaster security, except for South Asia, which experienced some major droughts in the last 10 years, which influ enced their score negatively. In 2020, 18 ADB members are still in the nascent and engaged stages, slightly down from 20 in 2013. The financing needs to achieve water security are enormous. ADB estimates the investment needs for water and sanitation to be on average $53 billion per year up to 2030, of which about one third will be needed from the private sector. Good governance is a critical enabling factor to advance water security in the region with sustainable impacts on the ground, leaving no one behin d. Achieving water security for all ADB Asia and the Pacific members requires robust public policies across all levels of government, a clear allocation of duties among responsible authorities, as well as regular monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, AWD O concludes. At the same time, adequate financial means should be made available to implement the needed institutional and technical interventions, which require appropriate enabling environments to make the best use of available water resources, water -related assets, and financial sources. From https://www.adb.org/ 12/18/2020 TOP Water Security a Top Priority in COVID -19 Recovery, Says ADB Report Economies of Asia and the Pacific must put water security at the top of their agenda to recover from the fallout from the coronavirus disease (COVID -19) pandemic and adapt to climate change, according to a new flagship report released today by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The Asian Water Development Outlook 2020 describes the status in the region of water security, which measures the availability of safe and affordable water supply, sanitation for all, improved livelihoods, and healthy ecosystems, with reduced water -related dis eases and floods. The need for water security is even more urgent due to the COVID -19 pandemic because access to water, sanitation, and hygiene offers the primary line of defense against the spread of COVID -19 and other diseases. Far too many people acros s Asia and the Pacific continue to suffer from limited access to these vital services, said ADB President Masatsugu Asakawa. The new AWDO edition serves as a tangible and reliable knowledge resource for ADB's developing members as they address the multif aceted challenges of water security. Despite achievements in Asia and the Pacific over the last few decades, 1.5 billion people living in rural areas and 600 million in urban areas still lack adequate water supply and sanitation. Of the 49 ADB regional m embers, 27 face serious water constraints on economic development, and 18 are yet to sufficiently protect their inhabitants against water -related disasters. The report uses updated methodologies and in -depth analysis of water financing and governance devel oped in partnership with the Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Development (OECD). The report stresses that it is imperative that countries drastically increase their investment in water, sanitation, and other water -related infrastructure and serv ices by convening all public, private, and innovative financing to achieve quality growth and the Sustainable Development Goals. Financing is also needed to enable and sustain a virtuous system of good governance, which requires efficient water -related organizations with sufficient capacity and financial resources to enable them to provide coherent policies, monitor and evaluate progress, and take action when needed, all in interaction with the stakeholders in a transparent way. Key recommendations in the report include: Put water at the center of sustainable rural development by promoting water -effective irrigation agriculture, community -based water and sanitation services, and locally resilient disaster risk reduction such as the combination of community protection and farmland flood retention. This will enable a good economic circle of locally affordable investment, income generation, proper management and operation, and an enhanced level of welfare for the people. Achieve urban water security by invest ing in water, sanitation, and disaster risk reduction infrastructure services not only in cities but also in slums and peripheral areas, while following a gender -based approach. Provide a healthy environment by drastically reducing pollution, stimulating a circular economy, increasing land protection, and embracing nature -based approaches. Increase the resilience of water systems to avoid water -related disasters and to be prepared for climate and other global changes. Turn recent lessons of disasters into better practices of tomorrow by rebuilding better. To improve the region's water security, ADB has programmed more than $6 billion in financial and technical assistance between 2020 and 2022 to support safe water supply, sanitation, and wastewater measur es; and more than $2 billion for flood risk management in the same time period \u2014together with tailored knowledge services that promote innovation and forge partnerships.

The trade volume of the province in cross -border e -commerce totaled more than 1,360 tonnes, about 13 times the number between January and October last ye ar, the customs said. Mainly contributed by the booming e -commerce sector, the province's export value reached more than 440 million yuan, up by 424.8 percent year on year. The major exports are daily necessities, clothing, and electronic products. Jilin's imports recorded a decline in value of 33.2 percent year on year but a surge exceeding 420 percent in volume during the period. Located at the junction of China, Russia, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the border city of Hunchun, Jilin, h as become a strong magnet for e-commerce and logistics enterprises at home and abroad. At present, the exports delivered by Hunchun's logistics companies can reach most parts of Russia in only 15 to 25 days, saving more than half of the time and economic c ost. Cross -border e-commerce has become a new growth and profits motor in the province's foreign trade. The customs plans to further improve its regulatory mechanism, and facilitate the sector's boom, according to Shi Jianping, deputy director of Changchun Customs. From http://www.new s.cn/ 12/02/2020 TOP Shanghai Community Safeguards Elderly Living Alone with Smart Devices For Zhang Meixia, an 87 -year-old woman who lives alone in Shanghai, 0.01 cubic meters of water is enough for her to do the laundry or cook a meal. That amount of water can even save her life. The Jiangsu Road sub -district of Changning District in Shanghai, where Zhang lives, has recently begun installing free smart water meters for elderly residents living alone to monitor their water consumption in real time. Once the reading within 12 hours falls below 0.01 cubic meters, the system will automatically aler t the community's managing platform and notify local cadres. Community volunteers will come to check the situation as soon as possible. \"As an elderly person living alone, my biggest fear is calling for help but no one comes. I am all for installing smart water meters in my home,\" said Zhang. Over two decades of living alone, Zhang's only experience with smart devices has been using her phone to make calls and take pictures of the flowers she grows on her balcony. She never expected that installing smart devices in her home could bring her such peace of mind. Just like Zhang, many elderly living alone in Shanghai are now being protected by smart devices such as smart water meters, smart door sensors, smoke detectors and infrared sensors. The managing platf orm run by the local government collects and analyzes data from these smart devices to ensure the well -being of the elderly, monitoring key indicators such as whether the front door has been opened or whether there have been signs of human activity within the past 24 hours. So far, the sub-district has installed more than 100 smart door sensors and nearly 10 smart water meters for elderly residents living alone in the community. Since the beginning of November when the data was uploaded to the local urban o peration and management center, the devices have issued 23 warnings. \"As I've gotten older, I've become more forgetful. Once I forgot about a frying pan on the gas stove. If it weren't for the alarms set off by the smoke detector, I would have been in big trouble. Soon volunteers also came to my door to check up on me after receiving warnings. I didn't expect those devices would be so helpful,\" Zhang said. Li Chun, the community volunteer paired with Zhang, said all the elderly living alone in the communit y are paired with volunteers who visit them every week. However, these volunteers can only do so much. \"These smart devices come in handy to take care of the elderly. As long as the water consumption exceeds 0.01 cubic meters, I know that Zhang is safe and sound at home, and I feel at ease,\" Li said. Shanghai is facing a severe aging problem. The number of people aged 60 and over in Shanghai was 5.18 million by the end of 2019, accounting for 35.2 percent of the total registered population in the city, according to the municipal health commission. Among them, 317,400 elderly are living alone. As a microcosm of the aging population in Shanghai, 40 percent of residents in the area are senior citizens, said Dai Tao, an official with the Jiangsu Road sub -district. Authorities hope to actively explore smart applications to solve real problems and share the benefits of technological progress with the elderly, Dai said. \"We plan to explore more ways of using smart water meters in the future. For example, instead o f only monitoring the minimum reading, we will also detect irregular increases in water consumption and send out warnings to the volunteers,\" Dai said, adding that relevant data is also under strict protection to avoid any privacy leakage.

The new project was announced on Friday at a press conference about the construction of an international consumption center in Shanghai's Pudong New Area , to which the new project will be linked. Hema Fresh will deliver imported goods to customers' designated addresses through its bonded online shopping model of cross -border e -commerce. This not only creates a new business model for domestic consumers to p urchase imported goods, but also provides a practical example for Pudong as an international consumption center, according to Hou Yi, CEO of Hema Fresh. According to Yang Chao, deputy head of Pudong New Area, the total retail sales of consumer goods in Pud ong exceeded 300 billion yuan (45.8 billion U.S. dollars) in 2019. Hema Fresh opened its first store in Pudong's Jinqiao in 2016. In 2020, the company established its headquarters in Pudong. From http://www.new s.cn/ 12/11/2020 TOP China's Yunnan Reports Surge in Cross -border E -commerce Southwest China's Yunnan Province reported a more than tenfold increase in cross -border e -commerce trade volume in the first 11 months of this year , local customs authorities said Tuesday. The import and export value of cross -border e-commerce in the province reached 640 million yuan (about 97.7 million U.S. dollars), 13.3 times higher than the number for the same period last year, according to the K unming customs. The development of cross -border e -commerce in Yunnan has picked up pace since the provincial capital Kunming was designated a national -level comprehensive test zone for cross -border e -commerce. To meet the demand of the booming sector, cust oms authorities of the region have been working to streamline customs clearance further and improve logistic efficiency. From http://www.new s.cn/ 12/15/2020 TOP Chinese Economy Cements Recovery, Better Growth Expected for 2020 China's key economic indicators for November unveiled Tuesday showed strengthening recovery, indicating a world -beating growth trend, as consumption and investment gradually return to normal levels. Retail and investment, two main growth drivers, have picked up the pace, with market entities and the employment sector showing strong vitality in November, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). Retail sales of consumer goods went up 5 percent ye ar on year in November, up from the 4.3 -percent surge in October, sustaining the upward momentum since the major consumption gauge posted its first positive growth in August this year. Fixed -asset investment edged up 2.6 percent year on year in the first 1 1 months of the year, up 0.8 percentage points from the rise in the first 10 months. During the January -November period, investment by the private sector rose 0.2 percent, the first growth registered this year. The surveyed urban unemployment rate stood at 5.2 percent in November, registering a four -month declining streak. Shining light on the November data, NBS spokesperson Fu Linghui said the sustained recovery fully demonstrated the economy's strong resilience and potential in the face of unprecedented C OVID -19 impact. Fu added that major gauges in November pointed to faster economic growth in Q4 from Q3, as both production and demand have continued to soar steadily. \"Looking ahead, China is expected to become the only major economy in the world to achi eve positive growth in 2020,\" Fu told a press conference. \"As the economy gradually returns to normal operation, a better economic growth for the whole 2020 is expected.\" Thanks to robust year -on-year growth of 4.9 percent in its gross domestic product in the third quarter, the country's economy expanded 0.7 percent in the first nine months, bucking a 1.6 percent contraction in the first half year and a 6.8 percent contraction in the first quarter when the virus took its toll. In the latest World Economic O utlook report released in October, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected China's economy to grow 1.9 percent in 2020, 0.9 percentage points higher than the IMF's June forecast, which would make China the only major economy to register positive gr owth this year. China did not set any numerical growth target this year. In the second half of 2020, domestic investment and consumer demand have continued to recover, and this positive trend could extend in 2021. \"China's economy will run with many favorable factors next year, and it is more likely that the economy will gradually return to the potential growth level,\" Fu said, adding that the growth rate in 2021 may be relatively high due to the low base this year. Wen Bin, chief analyst with the Chi na Minsheng Bank, attributed the economic recovery to accelerated production and rising demand in China. \"There's still large room for improvement,\" Wen said, adding that boosting consumption demand is critical to the country's future economic recovery. Ch ina aims to keep the economy running within a reasonable range and adhere to the strategy of expanding domestic demand in the coming year, according to a statement released Friday after a meeting, which analyzed the economic work for 2021, of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee. From http://www.new s.cn/ 12/15/2020 TOP China's Growth to Boost World Economic Recovery As the year is drawing to a close, China's economic rebound from COVID -19 is gathering pace as mirrored by improvements in key growth figures, which, for many market watchers, are a boon for the world economy still scrambling to shake off the severest recession in nearly a century. In the latest World Economic Outlook, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected China's economy to grow by 1.9 percent in 2020, 0.9 percentage points above its June forecast, making China the only major economy that will see positive growth this year. \"With the right mix of supportive macroeconomic policies focused on strengthening social safety nets and further key reforms, China will secure the recovery and ensure balanced and high-quality growth, which will benefit China and the world,\" said IMF Man aging Director Kristalina Georgieva. REBOUND ON TRACK A set of early indicators had shown that an across -the-board recovery of the world's second -largest economy was firmly on track. In November, the purchasing managers' index for the manufacturing sector , the main gauge of factory activities, reached 52.1 -- well above the boom -bust line of 50 and representing the highest level of the year. Accounting for more than half of China's GDP growth, the service sector has long been one of its main economic barom eters. Last month, the sub-index for business activities in the service sector rose to 55.7, also the highest level of the year. In terms of foreign trade, the revival continued too, as both new export orders and import sub -indexes hit a year -high and stay ed in the expansion territory for three consecutive months. Some China watchers are concerned that the country's recovery is unbalanced, with a faster rebound in the industrial sector and declining consumer spending, despite the latter being emphasized by the leadership as a leading driver amid a broader shift toward consumption -oriented growth. In yet another encouraging sign, the consumption sector rebounded too. In November, China's retail sales of consumer goods went up by 5 percent year on year to 3.95 trillion yuan (about 604.7 billion U.S. dollars), up from the 4.3 -percent gain in October after positive growth in August. More vigorous consumption recovery became apparent during this year's Singles' Day shopping festival, which yet again shattered a string of records from total sales volumes of participating brands. Boosted on the rebound, global chief financial officers (CFOs) have upgraded China's economic outlook to \"Modestly Improving\" for Q4 from \"Stable\" in Q3, showed a survey by the CNBC Global CFO Council, which gathers around 150 CFOs of some of the world's largest companies. The CFOs responding to Q4's survey feel more optimistic about the Chinese economy, the survey said. POSITIVE SPILLOVERS At a time when the coronavirus -triggered recessio n looms large globally, China's pace of expanding opening -up has been accelerating, generating positive spillover effects on the world economic recovery. China signed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement with other participating countr ies in mid -November. The world's largest trade pact will likely open up more sectors and promote business flow among signatories. It is conducive to boosting regional trade, and the spillover effects of China's growth will improve the economic recovery of participating countries, according to Steven Zhang, the chief economist at Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities. Amid efforts to nurture fertile ground for foreign businesses to thrive, China has this year implemented the Foreign Investment Law, trimmed the ne gative list for foreign investment, and eased foreign access to the financial market. Merlin Swire, chairman of Swire Pacific Limited, welcomed China's ongoing policy of a higher -level opening -up, saying that foreign investors have experienced strengthene d investor protection, a more leveled playing field, and a better business environment. Focusing on future high -quality growth, China has put forward a new development pattern of \"dual circulation,\" to forge better connectivity between internal and externa l markets. Huang Qifan, vice chairman of the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, saw the new paradigm as China's remedy to a global economy still mired in the doldrums. China's massive demand is estimated to generate over 27 trillion U.S. do llars of imports of goods and services in the following 10 years. It will surely provide a lasting boost to global revival in the post -pandemic era, Huang added. \"It is clear that no economic recovery from the current global economic slowdown is possible w ithout China being a major part of the equation,\" noted Rohana Mahmood, chair of APEC Business Advisory Council. From http://www.new s.cn/ 12/17/2020 TOP China Moves Fast to Become World Leader in Transport China is forging ahead in developing a comprehensive and multidimensional traffic network that is intelligent, safe and green as it looks to become a world leader in the field, according to a white paper released Tuesday. The whi te paper, titled \"Sustainable Development of Transport in China,\" was released by the State Council Information Office to provide a full picture of China's achievements in the field and share its strategy and activities in building a sustainable transport system. Following a strategy of coordinating the development of the transport industry with its economy and society, China has, over the past decades, transformed the once -backward sector into a modern network, which now leads the world in terms of the sca le of the transport infrastructure. By the end of 2019, China had a total of 139,000 km of rail track, of which high -speed lines represented 35,000 km, and a total of more than 5 million km of highways, of which expressways represented 150,000 km, accordin g to the white paper. The country's navigable inland waterways came in at 127,000 km and certified civil airports stood at 238. The road network density in the urban built -up areas was 6.65 km per sq km and the road area ratio was 13.19 percent. Boasting self-developed core technologies and world -leading mega -projects, China is also making steady progress from a follower to a leader in transport technology. China leads the world in technology for railways at high altitudes and in extremely low temperatures and is a global player in high -speed and heavy -haul railways. It has solved the most challenging technical problems confronting highway construction in difficult geological conditions such as plateau permafrost, expansive soil, and desert, according to th e white paper. China also leads in core technologies for building build deep -water offshore ports, improving massive estuary and long waterways, and building large airports. Pursuing a mutually beneficial strategy of opening up, China has been expanding cooperation with other countries in the field of transport, actively promoting global connectivity and engaging in global transport governance, the white paper noted. \"At present, the world is facing challenges from the COVID -19 pandemic and economic recess ion. Transport can play an important role in binding countries together and promoting economic growth during this difficult time,\" the white paper said. Facing changes in the international and domestic arena, China is moving faster in developing a national comprehensive and multidimensional traffic network, and reinforcing its strength in transport to satisfy the needs of its people, ensure adequate support for transport, and become a world leader in this field, according to the white paper. Giving priority to transport in future plans, China will shift its focus from speed and scale to quality and efficiency, from independent initiatives to integrated multimodal development, and from traditional drivers to innovative forces. \"Our country will build a modern comprehensive transport system that is safe, convenient, efficient, green and economical, equipped with world -class facilities, technology, management and services,\" the white paper stated, underlining the goal of building up significant strength in transport by 2035. Upholding the vision of a global community of shared future, China has vowed to continue implementing the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and strengthening international exchanges and transport cooperation. \"China will work w ith all other countries to promote global connectivity and stronger people -to-people ties, and make a greater contribution to building a better world,\" the white paper added.

The nighttime consumption recovery index has reached 92.6 this year, indicating the whole year's nighttime consumption is almost the same as last year, according to big data released by the China UnionPay Merchant Services Co., Ltd. (China UMS) on Wednesday. The index is mainly based on the value of consump tion between 6 p.m. on any given day and 6 a.m. the following day, and a reading of 100 indicates the nighttime economy is at the level of the same period the previous year. Respective readings of 102 and 104.5 in the third and fourth quarters show positiv e year -on-year growth for nighttime consumption throughout the second half of this year. China's nighttime consumption volume in the first quarter dropped by over 40 percent year on year due to the outbreak of COVID -19, according to China UMS data. The vol ume began to rebound in the second quarter after infections waned following national efforts to battle the epidemic. Night tourism, shopping and dining across the country witnessed the quickest recoveries, with respective consumption recovery index reading s of 102.9, 99.4 and 97.7. The consumption value of night shopping accounted for 24.1 percent of whole -day consumption this year, up 5.8 percentage points, and night dining accounted for 44.2 percent, up 11.3 percentage points. From http://www.new s.cn/ 12/23/2020 TOP China's Guizhou Province Accelerates 5G Development Guizhou Province, China's first comprehensive big data pilot area, had set up 20,215 5G base stations as of Wednesday to accelerate 5G development, local authorities said. The province in southwest China is currently home to more than 9 million 5G users, according to the Big Data Development Administration of Guizhou Province. The mountainous province is one of China's most impoverished areas, with electricity, coal, tobacco and liquor production as its major industries. As China started to upgrade its economy toward a greener vision with more advanced technologies, Guizhou accelerated its economic restructuring and emerged as the front-runner of the country's big data industry. Guizhou has stepped up the use of 5G technology in fields such as transport, healthcare and tourism, with the number of 5G application projects in the province reaching more than 170. The country greenlighted the commercial use of 5G in 2019. Promising faster speeds, wider broadband and lower latency, 5G network is regarded as the \"infrastructure\" for a variety of next -generation digital technologies including artificial intelligence, virtu al and augmented reality and driverless vehicles. China had set up 718,000 5G base stations as of November this year, Liu Liehong, vice -minister of Industry and Information Technology, said Wednesday. From http://www.new s.cn/ 12/24/2020 TOP China's Zhejiang Logs Surge in Cross -border E -commerce Zhejiang Province, an e -commerce heartland and foreign trade hub in east China, reported a robust increase in cross -border e -commerce trade in the first 11 months of this year.

From http://www.new s.cn/ 12/25/2020 TOP China Boosts Opening -up of Futures Market to Attract Global Traders China's drive to open its futures markets to the outside world has gathered pace with an ultimate goal to serve the real economy amid the country's efforts to seek high-quality development. China currently has seven kinds of commodity futures and options open to direct partici pation by international investors, after overseas investors were allowed to participate in the futures trading of a type of palm oil on Dec. 22. This came right after China launched the listing and trading of bonded copper futures contracts on Nov. 19, whi ch are open to global traders. The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), the country's top securities regulator, said Friday it will further expand the scope of specific futures varieties, enhance the participation of overseas traders and support overseas financial institutions in controlling or holding a stake in domestic futures firms. The futures market can sharpen its competitive edge amid the internationalization while attracting more global investors, CSRC vice chairman Fang Xinghai said at a conference on Dec. 19. The opening -up of the sector can boost China's pricing power in key commodities markets, said Luo Xufeng, chairman of Nanhua Futures Co., Ltd. China has fast -tracked the opening -up of the futures market this year, with new rules ma king it easier for international investors to trade in China's markets. The country removed foreign ownership limits for foreign -invested securities companies, fund management firms and futures companies at the beginning of this year. The top securities re gulator in June granted approval allowing J.P. Morgan Futures Co., Ltd. to become the country's first wholly foreign -owned futures trading firm. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the launch of China's futures market, which has developed quickly in re cent years. At the end of November, funds in China's futures market had exceeded 855.95 billion yuan (130.48 billion U.S. dollars), up 55.2 percent year on year, CSRC data showed. Meanwhile, the turnover in China's futures market reached 382.5 trillion yu an from January to November, up 45.5 percent year on year, according to the data. The commodity futures available to international investors have been operating smoothly, such as crude oil and iron ore futures. In Shanghai, the transshipment business of crude oil based on Shanghai crude oil futures price has expanded to the Republic of Korea, Singapore and other regions. The iron ore futures trading on the Dalian Commodity Exchange has attracted about 270 overseas investors from 21 countries and regions. Th ough China's futures market has made remarkable progress, it still needs to improve market mechanisms, products, rules and infrastructure, while boosting its pricing power on key commodities to better serve the high -quality development of the economy, Fang said. From http://www.new s.cn/ 12/28/2020 TOP China's PMI Remains in Expansion Zone amid Steady Economic Recovery The purchasing managers' index (PMI) for China's manufacturing sector came in at 51.9 in December, edging down 0.2 percentage points from November, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said Thursday. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, while a reading below reflects contraction. The December PMI remained in the expansion zone for the tenth consecutive month, indicating that the country's manufacturing sector continued its steady recovery, said NBS senior statistician Zhao Qinghe, adding that the reading stood at a high level within the year. The sub-index for pr oduction stood at 54.2 in December, down 0.5 percentage points from November, while that for new orders dropped 0.3 percentage points to 53.6. Despite the slight decline from the previous month, the two sub -indexes saw their gap continue to narrow, which i ndicated a more balanced relationship between production and demand, Zhao said. Meanwhile, the new export order and import sub -indexes edged down from 51.5 and 50.9 in November to 51.3 and 50.4, respectively, staying within the expansion territory. The su b-index for exporters' outlooks for their production and business activities maintained an eight -month recovery to reach a one -year high, while the high-tech manufacturing sector, with its sub -index remaining above the manufacturing PMI throughout 2020, ha s played a vital role in pushing forward the recovery of the manufacturing sector, Zhao said. Thursday's data also showed that the PMI for China's non -manufacturing sector came in at 55.7 in December, down from 56.4 in November. The non -manufacturing PMI h as remained above 50 for 10 consecutive months, NBS data showed. In December, the service sector saw a slower recovery, with the sub -index for business activities standing at 54.8. The figure was down from 55.7 in November but still remained at a relativ ely elevated level for the year. Analyzing the December PMI readings, Wen Bin, chief analyst at China Minsheng Bank, said in a co -authored research note that the Chinese economy has rebounded steadily, but challenges still linger for future recovery. More support should be provided for the manufacturing industry and small firms, while policies need to be more targeted and effective, Wen added. China aims to keep the economy running within a reasonable range and adhere to the strategy of expanding domestic d emand in the coming year, according to the tone -setting Central Economic Work Conference that took place in December. From http://www.new s.cn/ 12/31/2020 TOP JAPAN: Regional Banks Take Lead in Digitization A divide has emerged in the regional banking industry. Banks with solid management bases and high capital ratios have taken the reins on digitization, leaving the institutions that cannot afford to do so trying to find ways to cu t costs by reducing branch numbers and personnel. The Bank of Yokohama, a Concordia Financial Group Ltd. subsidiary, installed a tablet -based system in all of its branches this month that enables customers to complete procedures such as opening accounts and registering address changes paperlessly. Customer waiting times have been drastically reduced, a salesperson at the bank's head office in Nishi Ward, Yokohama, said. Leading regional banking group Concordia has set a goal of reducing the workload at it s branches and administrative centers by about 30% over five years from fiscal 2019 by promoting digitization. We've made progress in streamlining [operations]. The challenge for next fiscal year is to expand digital services for customers, a member of t he bank's digital strategy department said. Major regional banks in western Japan are also aggressively making moves. Fukuoka Financial Group Inc., which owns the Bank of Fukuoka, Kumamoto Bank and Juhachi -Shinwa Bank in Nagasaki, became the first regiona l organization to obtain a license to operate a smartphone app -based bank in December. Minna no Bank, which is scheduled to start full -scale operations around May 2021, is aimed at younger customers. Smartphone users will be able to complete all banking procedures, such as opening bank accounts and applying for loans, on the Minna no Bank app. The number of people who visit bank [branches] has fallen by about 40% in the past decade. We have to adapt more drastically than other industries to keep up with ch anges in customer demand, said Fukuoka Financial Group Chairman and President Takashige Shibato. Regional banks that are struggling with new investments are taking a more defensive stance. Nanto Bank in Nara is implementing structural reforms led by Vice President Satoshi Ishida. A former official of the Financial Services Agency, the 46 -year-old Ishida is a young executive with expertise in corporate revitalization. The bank plans to reduce the number of branches by about 30% over 10 years. It also aims to reduce the number of employees over five years, to about 2,000 from about 2,500 \u2014 as of the end of September 2020. Some banks have opted to shorten opening hours. Fukushima Bank's six branches have been providing counter services only in the morning sin ce autumn. Branch employees who work on counters in the morning focus on customer visits and other responsibilities in the afternoon, in an effort to make effective use of limited human resources, according to the bank. Yuki Fukumoto of NLI Research Insti tute said: Smaller regional banks are lagging behind in cost reduction efforts compared to large regional banks. They need to improve the efficiency of their branches and link their systems. Regional banks have a thinner pool of human resources compared to the nation's megabanks. There is an urgent need for regional institutions to raise their level as they lack the investment capabilities to earn profits through trading stocks, government bonds and other securities. According to the Bank of Japan's Finan cial System Report released in October, if regional banks book the same gains on the sale of securities as those posted in the last three years through fiscal 2019, unrealized gains will dry up in 4.3 years. While unrealized gains of major banks have fall en about 20% compared with those in fiscal 2015, at regional banks the fall was about 60%, leaving them with little room to maneuver. Jimoto Holdings Inc.'s Kirayaka Bank in Yamagata held unrealized losses of \u00a54.3 billion as of the end of September 2020. Many regional banks do not have anyone who can teach investment management, said Naoto Oguri, president of Nagomi Capital Co., which trains investment managers for regional banks. Some regional banks have been looking outside to escape the situation. Jimo to Holdings and Shimane Bank have decided to form an equity tie -up with major internet securities firm SBI Holdings Inc. to benefit from its investment expertise. By relying on SBI, we will be able to move in the direction of stable investment management in the future, Jimoto Holdings Chairman Takashi Suzuki said.

The Ministry of Science and ICT said it marks the first time in the world that free Wi -Fi services will be provided on all of the 35,006 city buses in operation. The ministry and 16 provincial governments began setting up free Wi -Fi networks on buses i n 2018 and completed the project in October this year in an effort to reduce households' communication bills and help citizens better access the internet. \"It is meaningful that the service will help reduce the burden of communications bills for people who might have difficulty in using high -priced subscription packages,\" ICT Minister Choi Ki -young said. The accumulated number of times the free Wi -Fi services were used on buses reached 420 million between May 2019 and October 2020, the ministry said. This t ranslates into each person in the country's 51.6 million population using such services eight times. The ministry said the free bus Wi -Fi services will enable people to have economic benefits valued at around 22 million won (US$20,000) over the next three years.

Suh Hoon, director of national security at the presidential office, pointed out that the importance of cybersecuri ty has been highlighted more this year than at any other time. He cited the spread of contactless activities, such as online classes and working from home. Speaking at the annual \"national cybersecurity policy coordination meeting,\" he called for the revie w of tasks on new security threats in the coronavirus era and a preemptive response. It was held at the national crisis management center at Cheong Wa Dae, joined by vice ministerial officials at 16 government offices. From https://en.yna.co.kr 12/16/2020 TOP S. Korea's 5 G Download Speed Fastest Globally: Report South Korea has the fastest 5G download speed in the world, reaching over 350 megabits per second (Mbps), a report showe d Monday. The country's 5G download speed stood at an average 351.2 Mbps, followed by Saudi Arabia at 272.8 Mbps and Taiwan at 247.7 Mbps, industry tracker Opensignal said in a report, citing data collected between Sept. 1 and Nov. 29 in 15 global markets with 5G networks. The result marks an improvement for South Korea from a previous report by Opensignal in October, which had found the country's 5G download speed as the world's second fastest after Saudi Arabia. South Korea was the first country to commer cialize the latest generation network in April last year and has racked up just under 10 million 5G users as of end -October, accounting for 14 percent of the country's total 70 million mobile subscriptions. The time South Korean 5G users spent connected to the network, however, stood at 24.6 percent, behind Kuwait at 29 percent and Saudi Arabia at 27.8 percent, according to the Opensignal report. South Korea has yet to commercialize the standalone version of 5G, requiring support from past generation networ ks, such as 4G LTE. The country's three major mobile carriers promised earlier this year to spend up to 25.7 trillion won (US$23.3 billion) until 2022 to update network infrastructure and establish nationwide 5G coverage.

In explai ning the figure at a virtual press briefing, he said, \"Apart from those who have comorbidities, have been infected with COVID -19, and pregnant women, there are still 181.5 million people.\" According to him, there are 269 million people living in Indonesia currently, with 188 million of them aged between 18 and 59. Considering the need for twice vaccinations and vaccine reserves, it means that Indonesia requires around 426 million doses. Currently, Sadikin said, the Indonesian government has agreements to pr ocure 125 million doses of vaccine with Chinese biopharmaceutical company Sinovac Biotech, and 130 million doses with U.S. biotechnology company Novavax. Besides, the Indonesian government is in the process of cooperating to procure 100 million doses of va ccine with British -Swedish multinational pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca and another 100 million doses with U.S. multinational pharmaceutical corporation Pfizer. Meanwhile, Indonesia also has cooperation in procuring around 16 million to 100 million dos es of free vaccine with the COVAX facility, a COVID -19 vaccine distribution program prepared mainly by the World Health Organization (WHO). The first period of vaccination will be from January to April 2021, for inoculating 1.3 million medical workers, 17. 4 million public workers, and 21.5 million elderly people. \"The vaccination for the elderly will be given if the safety certificate from the BPOM (Indonesian Food and Drug Monitoring Agency) has been issued,\" added Sadikin. The second period will run from April 2021 to March 2022.

Cambodia remained in the \"medium human deve lopment\" category among 189 countries and regions, said the UNDP 2020 Human Development Report. The HDI is designed to reflect the average achievement in key dimensions of human development including income, education, and health metrics. The report said C ambodia's gross national income (GNI) per capita increased to 4,246 U.S. dollars in 2019 from 3,876 dollars in 2018 on the PPP (purchasing power parity) basis. \"Cambodia could be an example of how human development can go hand in hand with environmental su stainability,\" Nick Beresford, UNDP's resident representative in Cambodia, said in a press release. \"With new technologies, promoting investment in green economy, including expansion of environment -related infrastructure such as renewable energy, green transportation, climate -smart agriculture and community forest expansion, will offer an opportunity for Cambodia to achieve higher levels of human development with an inclusive and sustainable economic growth,\" he added. The 2020 Human Development Report was based on the data before the COVID -19 pandemic, UNDP said, adding that the COVID -19 impact in Cambodia is equivalent to losing five years of HDI progress.

The BOI said that the smart visa offer had already been approved by the government's Center for Covid -19 Situation Administration (CCSA). Among the move's aims is to allow digital freelancers currently working in Thailand to exchange their tourist visas for smart visas, said Narit Therdsteerasukdi, BOI deputy secretary general. To be eligible, applicants must have an employment contract with a foreign firm lasting at least six months and proof of qualifications and professional experience. After that, BOI partners will help in screening their professional backgrounds, Narit said. After receiving the smart visa, their expertise could be tapped by universities, the Digital Economy Promotion Agency, National Innovation Agency, National Science and Technology Development Agency, and others. Known as digital nomads, the foreign freelancers currently work in Bangkok, Phuket, Chiang Mai and even on Koh Phangan in Surat Thani province, where they have set up a co -working space, Narit explained. The n ew visa rules will also cover experienced foreign executives in several businesses, helping to boost development of an investment ecosystem, especially for start -ups. Their expertise could be applied to innovation camps, co-working spaces, advanced materia ls and packaging, and 3D printing, said in the BOI press release. The BOI also aims to lure academics to government universities to teach subjects beyond science and technology. These would include innovation, technology management and entrepreneurship. Sm art visa holders are permitted to stay up to four years in Thailand without a work permit. The visas also allow travel in and out of the country, as well as fast -track privileges at airports.

The trainees are mostly selling products online or working to become sale co -ordinators of brands. Despite losing their eyesight, they believe they can take advantage of digital ent repreneurship opportunities and technology empowerment to have stable jobs during the turbulence of the pandemic. Lng Th Hi Yn, a visually -impaired trainee, said blind people like her, with voice assistance and support from others, can use computers t o learn digital business knowledge and skills to approach customers and how to advertise products. Like many other blind people, Y n's main job used to be at a massage parlour in H\u00e0 N i. More than 100 massage parlours and other service venues which provide d jobs for visually -impaired people in the capital city were closed as non -essential services during the COVID -19 social distancing period earlier this year. Being among millions of people with disabilities nationwide who lost their jobs due to the COVID -19 pandemic, with consultation from others, Y n decided to learn marketing skills and sell perfume online. She acts as a sale co -ordinator who advertises products, orders the perfume and has it delivered to customers and can earn a stable source of income during the pandemic. For visually -impaired people, selling products online has some difficulties. For example, we cannot advertise products through images. Instead of doing that, we livestream, write descriptions to make advertisements or directly consult customers, she said. The disabled have limited ability to move around. Thanks to technology, we are connected with the outside world so that we know how the world is developing and what chances, including job opportunities, are available for us, she to ld Vit Nam News. Tr n Trung Hiu, chairman of Vocational Training Centre of the H\u00e0 N i Blind Association, said those with visual impairment and the disabled in general are among the hardest hit by the pandemic. According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)'s Rapid Assessment on Socio -Economic Impacts of COVID -19 which interviewed more than 900 people with disabilities in Vi t Nam in May, 30 per cent lost their jobs during COVID -19. Neatly half had their work hours reduced, and almost 60 per cent had their pay cut. Up to 72 per cent of the interviewees had an income of less than VN1 million (US$44) in March when the first wave of the pandemic peaked in Vi t Nam. Not only facing challenges during the COVID -19, but people with disabilities al so have difficulties in the fourth industrial revolution. They have little access to information technology, Hi u said. With the support of the UNDP and Japanese government, the four -month course will provide digital skills training for people with differ ent disabilities to adapt for digitalisation after COVID -19. Many of the trainees have already started to run their businesses or practise online marketing skills. We [the disabled] have been present on the internet and are ready to engage in the supply chain, Hi u said. \u00e0o Thu Hng, UNDP Vietnam's disability rights officer, said working online from home helps people with disabilities cut travel costs and minimise travel difficulties caused by traffic. While working at home, they can get personal assis tance when needed, face less discrimination and be better protected from psychological pain. Nguy n Hnh Th, a disabled English teacher in H\u00e0 N i, believes that with tools like computers or tablets, people with disabilities can do their jobs, earn incomes and reduce the pressure on their families. Th suffers from spinal cord injuries and has been in a wheelchair for 30 years. Over the past 30 years, she has been running free English classes for poor students, those in disadvantaged circumstances and peopl e with disabilities like her. Due to the impacts of COVID -19, she has made use of the internet to offer online classes to her students. I always encourage my disabled children to learn English and information technology skills and then use digital technol ogy to earn money. That's how technology works for the disabled, she said.

Nguy n Th L, its chairwoman, praised the efforts made by the People's Committee to carry out the socio -economic, cultural and other tasks set out for 2020, and said it had plans in place for economic recovery next year. The Covid -19 situation remained unpredictable globally and in Vi t Nam, affecting the city and country's efforts to achieve socio -economic targets, she said. Fortunately they had taken drastic measures to contain the virus, enabling recovery and socio -economic development, she said. The city's economic growth rate this year had been 1. 39 per cent. The city should continue to remain on guard, she said. It should also work to speed up public investment and address other public problems, she said. A number of industries and services have experienced a slowdown. Administrative reform remai ns tardy. The criteria for assessing the satisfaction of the public and businesses have not been consistent. Construction -related violations remained a critical issue in some places that are urbanising rapidly. Flooding, traffic congestion and accidents w ere other problems, while social order and safety remained problematic, she said, citing drug crimes as a particular concern. New Th c City U\u00f4ng Chu Lu, vice chairman of the National Assembly, said at the opening that the proposal to establish the new Th c City was expected to be approved by the National Assembly Standing Committee on December 9.

Speaking at a Q&A session o f the 18th meeting of the 15th tenure H\u00e0 N i People's Council, Chairman of the city People's Committee Chu Ngoc Anh said H\u00e0 Ni's budget collection totalled VN280 trillion (US$12.1 billion), exceeding the estimate by 2 per cent, and up 3.5 per cent year -on-year. Meanwhile, budget spending stands at about VN87 trillion, equivalent to 84.7 per cent of the estimate set earlier this year. Notably, the city has attracted some $4 billion in foreign investment and VN145 trillion in domestic investment, Anh said , adding that the number of newly -established firms has exceeded 26,000. He also highlighted achievements in culture, education, administrative reform, the fight against corruption and wastefulness, national defence, external affairs and COVID -19 combat. A ccording to the municipal mayor, the committee will promptly devise specific programmes and plans to realise socio -economic development targets and tasks set for 2021 and adopted by the People's Council at the session.

From https://vietnamnews.vn 12/09/2020 TOP Vit Nam Sets an Example in Poverty Reduction Vit Nam is expected to lower its national average poverty rate from 58.1 per cent in 1993 to 2.75 per cent by the end of 2020, becoming a role model in the world in poverty reduction and hunger elimination, said Prime Minister Nguy n Xu\u00e2 n Ph\u00fa c. He was speaking at a national onli ne conference on Friday to review poverty reduction work in 2016 -20. Vi t Nam is among 30 countries applying multidimensional poverty reduction criteria which include income, access to basic social services like healthcare, education, housing, clean water, hygiene and information. In 2016 -20, the country has mobilised VN93 trillion (US$4.1 billion) for the national target programme on sustainable poverty reduction. According to PM Ph\u00fa c, during that period, the National Assembly and the Government spent 21 per cent of the State budget on social security, two times higher than the investment of the previous period and the highest figure among ASEAN countries. Vi t Nam has also offered financial assistance sourced from the State budget for 13 million people affected by the COVID -19 pandemic. Poverty reduction is a social and humanitarian task of top importance. This is also an important socialist orientation of Vi t Nam under the leadership of the Party, he said. All communes have roads for cars connected wi th the commune's centre while 99 per cent of commune centres and 60 per cent of villages have electricity. PM Ph\u00fa c cited H\u00f9 ng L i Commune, Y\u00ean Sn District in the northern mountainous province of Tuy\u00ea n Quang as an example of poverty reduction. Being 40km f rom Tuy\u00ea n Quang City, the commune has 7,000 people and 70 per cent of the households are classified as poor. As of November 2019, about 280 people of the commune were working for Samsung and each of them sent VN5 million to VN6 million ($217 -260) to thei r families each month. Another example is from Tr\u00e0 Linh Commune, Nam Tr\u00e0 My District in central Qu ng Nam Province. People who wanted to reach the commune used to have to walk nine hours. Since a road was built, it now takes drivers 30 minutes to travel fr om the province's centre to the commune. Those examples show infrastructure and a favourable business and investment climate which helps create jobs for local people are the best solutions to sustainable poverty reduction, he said. However, the PM also pointed out a number of challenges Vit Nam has to face. He warned of unsustainable poverty reduction in many places, widening gaps between the rich and the poor as well as the risk of poverty relapse, especially in mountainous remote areas, ethnic minority areas and regions frequently hard-hit by n atural disasters. In many areas, the poverty rate remains more than 5 per cent and stands high among the ethnic minority community. On average, one of five poor households is a disabled family. Impacts from the COVID -19 pandemic have slowed and disrupted s ustainable development progress. Oxfam has estimated that half a billion people in the world or more than 8 per cent of the world's population could be pushed into poverty due to COVID -19. This is such a big challenge for global poverty reduction, Ph\u00fac s aid. The Government leader highlighted that one of the most important solutions to reduce poverty was to invest in infrastructure, create trade connections, education and job opportunities. He ordered agencies to stick to the inclusive poverty reduction pr ogramme and adopt an investment plan for the national target programme on poverty reduction. He noted that more attention must be paid to children, the elderly and ethnic minority communities to ensure no one is left behind. Ministries and sectors should p rioritise State sources and call for private investment and support from international donors in poverty reduction work. The PM pointed out that to solve poverty, it is necessary to start from production, business to create employment. Service agriculture development should be given priority, especially programmes focused on low -income areas. From https://vietnamnews.vn 12/12/2020 TOP HCM City to Develop Public Cultural Spaces HCM City needs to assess the features of its cultural and architectural identity so that it can create viable urban public spaces, experts said at a recent seminar. The seminar, which discussed solutions for the development of public cultural spaces, attracted architectural and cultural experts as well as local leaders. It was organised by the municipal Party Committee's Propaganda Department, the Council for Theory, Literature and Arts Criticism and the Association of Architects. Public cultural spaces are common places for community activities that all residents have the right to freely access and use such as squares, parks, pedestrian streets, surface water, spaces along the riverbank, and sidewalks. They play an important role in strengthening social coh esion and improving the quality of life and physical and spiritual health of residents. The public space shows the city's cultural identity and civilisation, general secretary of the city's Association of Historical Sciences, Nguy n Th Hu, said. The ci ty government should develop solutions on public space development to bring the most practical benefits to the community in a humane way, she said. The city has been developed around rivers and canals, so its typical identity is a river-based culture. Bui lding public cultural spaces should promote the preservation of traditional intangible cultural heritage practices. The design for public cultural spaces should combine tradition and modernity, experts said. Existing water bodies such as S\u00e0 i G\u00f2 n River or T h Ngh\u00e8 Canal have been an integral part of the city's development, making them ideal spaces to promote cultural public activities, architect Ph m Ph\u00fa C ng said. Nguy n Tn Vn, former chairman of the city's Association of Architects, said developing publ ic spaces along rivers and canals would create a unique identity for the city. Sharing the same idea, architect Nguy n Anh Tu n of the city's Department of Planning and Architecture, said that the landscapes along rivers and canals have the potential to be come the backbone of urban cultural activities. The city should create public spaces associated with trade, entertainment and cultural activities on rivers and canals. More efforts and solutions are also needed to prevent pollution and improve the landsc ape along rivers and canals, he said. Dr. L\u00ea H ng Ph c from the HCM City University of Social Sciences and Humanities said the city should create a public space for n ca t\u00e0 i t (Southern folk music) which has been recognised by UNESCO as an intangible c ultural heritage. n ca t\u00e0 i t performances could be organised at existing public spaces in the city such as Book Street on Nguy n Vn B\u00ecnh Street in District 1. The city should also set up a street to serve as a place for performing traditional arts, suc h as Huy n Tr\u00e2 n C\u00f4 ng Ch\u00fa a Street in District 1, he said. Challenges Urban planning calls for 7sq.m of public space per capita but the current public space in the city is just 1.06sq.m per person. Most existing public spaces are located in inner districts, while there are no or only a few public spaces in outlying districts. More trees and water surface, and lights for existing public parks are needed, experts said. The city should also learn from other countries' experiences in building public space and co nsult leading architects. H u said clearing illegal encroachment on pavements and roads in the city is needed. However, the city should research street planning to manage streetside vendors on pavements and roads, instead of clearing all of them because s treet trading is a typical feature that attracts tourists\". Phan Nguy n Nh Khu\u00ea, head of the municipal Party Committee's Propaganda Department, said the city was considering building public spaces for cultural activities on Nguy n Th ng Hi n Street and a n area around H Con R\u00f9 a (Turtle Lake) in District 3. At H Con R\u00f9a, it plans to organise n ca t\u00e0 i t performances every Saturday night, art performances and entertainment programmes for children every Sunday night, and musical fountain, water puppetry s hows and exhibitions on other days. The city will also develop an annual lantern festival in District 8. Proposed solutions, ideas and suggestions at the seminar will be recorded to study in depth. These will help the city prepare a clear roadmap for build ing public spaces, he added. From https://vietnamnews.vn 12/12/2020 TOP Teleconference Reviews 10 Years of Rural Development A national teleconference took place on Saturday to review outcomes of the 10 -year implementation of the Party Central Committee Secretariat's Conclusion 61 and the Prime Minister's Decision 673 on rural development. Conclusion 61, issued on December 3, 2009, focuses on a project on improving the role an d responsibility of the Viet Nam Farmers' Union (VFU) in the development of agriculture, new -style rural area building and the building of Vietnamese farmer class. Decision 673 was issued on May 10, 2011, covering the VFU's implementation of and collaborat ion to run a number of rural socio -economic and cultural development programmes and projects for 2011 - 2020. Delivering a report at the event, VFU Chairman Th\u00e0 o Xu\u00e2 n S\u00f9 ng said the two documents had been important resources for the VFU to organise activiti es for agricultural growth, rural economic restructuring, human resources improvement, new -style rural area building, poverty reduction, and better living standards. The nation now has 27,000 farmers' households whose annual incomes exceed VN1 billion ( US$43,207), with the rural poverty rate under 3 per cent this year. Under Decision 673, the VFU has conducted a project on overhauling the fund for supporting farmers, which received more than VN2.64 trillion from the Government and municipal and provinc ial authorities. The fund has so far assisted 568,737 households in building production and business models. Vocational training and consultation for farmers, as well as communication campaigns to encourage farmers to engage in new -style rural area buildin g, were also key activities over the last decade, S\u00f9 ng added. To date, Vi t Nam has 5,177 communes, or 58.2 per cent of its total, granted new -style rural area status. Concluding the function, Prime Minister Nguy n Xu\u00e2 n Ph\u00fa c said despite natural disasters and diseases, under the Party's leadership and the Government's management, the VFU had worked with ministries, sectors and local authorities to build rural infrastructure, boost economic development, protect the environment and ensure security and farmers ' living standards.

From https://vietnamnew s.vn 12/14/2020 TOP Hospitals Benefit from Great Development in Social Work System Minister of Health Nguy n Tr ng Sn told a conference to review the last 10 years of its development held in HCM City yesterday. All central -level hospitals, 90 per cent at the provincial level and 80 per cent at the district level now have social work departments, and the number of social workers at hospitals has increased, according to the deputy minister. In the past social work ers at hospitals mostly used to be involved with charity, but now also provide psychological assistance to patients. During the COVID -19 outbreaks they did the tasks of screening people entering hospitals and teaching patients preventive measures well. They have called on companies to donate medical equipment. The social work department at Ch Ry Hospital was held up as an outstanding model. Nguy n Tri Th c, the hospital's director, said the department had been developed from a social work team set up in 2004. It has worked with charity organisations and sponsors to subsidise hospital fees for poor patients, and has been providing 5,000 free meals to poor patients every day for the last 12 years. It also provides psychological assistance in many ways, he said, adding that this year, for instance, patients getting infusion therapy could listen to symphony music or read newspapers. Social workers at hospitals also provide legal assistance to patients and help them perform daily activities. But Sn also pointed to deficiencies like lack of a legal framework for such activities. More training courses should be organised to improve the capacity of social workers at hospitals, he said. Assoc Prof Nguy n Tun Hng, deputy director of the Ministry of Health's personnel and organisation department, said social work had been developed throughout the country, contributing to the creation of an advanced social welfare system.

Speaking at a meeting held on December 18 to review vocational training this year, ng Minh S , head of department's professional education division, instructed them to step up communication about their strengths in training, enrolment methods, student policies, and investment in modern technical equipment for training, and strengthen co-operation with domestic and inte rnational vocational schools and enterprises. Professional education establishments in the city have been instructed to strengthen co-operation with small and medium -sized enterprises to provide short -term training courses to their workers. L\u00ea Minh T n, its head, instructed vocational training establishments to use IT in online training since COVID -19 still poses a risk. In upcoming time, they should soon complete quality accreditation as scheduled. The city this year has 393 professional education and voca tional training establishments with 13,068 lecturers, down 174 institutions from last year as a result of the pandemic. Their average enrolment was 74.48 per cent of the target, though a number of schools such as Cao Th ng Technical College, College of Foreign Economic Relations, and others managed 100 per cent due to innovation in enrolment and high training quality. Dr Ph m Hu Lc, rector of L\u00fd T Trng College, said his college has career counselling programmes at a number of secondary and high schoo ls. With the Directorate of Vocational Education and Training and the department organising many programmes to honour skilled workers and outstanding students and lecturers at professional education and vocational training schools, more and more parents ar e allowing their children to enrol for such courses, he said. Many companies come to these schools to recruit large numbers of students, he added. In 2020 professional education and vocational training establishments trained 141,832 students, and nearly 81 per cent of them from got jobs after graduating. The department co -operated this year with other relevant agencies and enterprises to organise job fairs through which 83,000 people were hired. From https://vietnamnews. vn 12/21/2020 TOP PM Calls for Better Care for Workers Prime Minister Nguy n Xu\u00e2 n Ph\u00fa c on Thursday asked the Vi t Nam General Confederation of Labour (VGCL) to take better care of workers. Speaking at a working s ession with the VGCL's leaders in H\u00e0 N i, the PM said: Caring for and ensuring stable jobs, as well as improving living standards and working conditions for workers is an important and urgent task of the Party, the State, of the political system, of each worker and all of society, in which the trade union has a great role and responsibility. The close co -ordination between the Government and VGCL over the past five years has helped solve a lot of labour -related matters and the trade union has brought into full play its role in building policies relating to labourers, he said. A report from VGCL showed that after five years, the number of employed workers increased by 26 per cent. The regional minimum wage rose by 1.3 times and average income increased by 3 5 per cent, contributing to improving income and living standards for workers. The number of workers with stable jobs and high income has gradually increased over the years. Despite accounting for only 14 per cent of the population and 27 per cent of the s ocial workforce, the working class contributes mote than 65 per cent of the country's gross national product and more than 70 per cent of the State Budget, the PM said. However, he said: In the new context, especially under the impact of international integration and strong digital transformation, our country's workers are facing many challenges. The low skill of labourers is a very big problem and so is the ability to adapt to some industries. Due to the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic, many factories and companies had to reduce their operations or lay off staff. The incomes of some workers were not enough for them to survive, causing difficulty for their children's schooling. These things concern all of us, Ph\u00fac said. He suggested agencies and local authorities work with trade unions and employers to build housing, schools and other facilities to ease hardships for labourers. The PM said the Government encouraged employers to apply modern technical standards, management systems and advanced technolog ies into production and business activities to improve working conditions and ensure safety for employees. He called on workers across the country to overcome difficulties and study to improve their qualifications, contributing to the growth of each busine ss for their happiness and the prosperity of the country. Ph\u00fa c also directed agencies, the VGCL and enterprises to prepare the best for workers on the occasion of T t (Lunar New Year), especially those in difficult circumstances so everyone can welcome the New Year in a warm and happy manner. From https://vietnamnews.vn 12/25/2020 TOP Online Sales Boom as T t Approaches With people afraid to visit public places like supermarket s because of Covid -19, e-commerce floors have become a convenient and safe shopping place for T t items. With Vi t Nam boasting a large internet community and a young, digital -savvy population, the e -commerce market is buzzing with activity ahead of the fe stival, which falls on February 12. Many consumers say that the hectic year -end schedule keeps them busy and they cannot go shopping, but the dizzying growth in e-commerce and e -payment is lending a hand. Now, without leaving office or home, they can place orders online and wait for the goods to be delivered home. Many large e-supermarkets and social networking sites claim to have carefully prepared to ship a large volume of goods to serve a huge, growing demand, and launched a number of promotions. Big C s upermarket has worked with suppliers to ensure there is enough food to meet the T t demand, and said it would stock 20 per cent more pork and 25 per cent more poultry meat than last year. A spokesperson said the pandemic would prevent many people from trav elling home, but the demand for Tet would remain huge. The supermarket offers online shopping and free delivery within a 10km radius within two hours, he said. Nguy n Anh c, general director of Saigon Co.opmark -- said the supermarkets would increase del ivery staff by 25 per cent and deliver anywhere in the country wherever one orders from. Trn Ng c Tr\u00e2n, who works in HCM City's District 5, said she had a lot of year -end work to finish and little time to shop even for the most traditional, must -have foo d items for T t (Lunar New Year), which is by far the most important festival of the year. Online shopping is a solution for her: She has ordered some traditional central region dishes like pickled scallion, salted figs and papaya shrimp sauce and asked th e supermarket to ship them to her home in B\u00ecnh nh Province. A spokesperson for an e-commerce business said with much lower overheads than brick and mortar stores, online shopping centres are able to offer promotions and discounts. Some popular sites like sendo, lazada, chodientu, hotdeal, tiki, and zalora are offering discounts of up to 50 per cent on all types of products, especially fashion and beauty like shoes, handbags, watches, and sunglasses. Foodstuffs are most in demand for the festival, and are advertised widely on the internet with many discount programmes. Though the discounts are not as high as on other consumer goods, people can still buy confectionary, soft drinks, noodles, and other items at discounts of up to 39 per cent.

From http://www.xinhuanet.com 12/29/2020 TOP South Asia INDIA: Going Online Is a Necessity No More an Option E-governance was there from the past 15 to 20 years but the COVID pandemic has flagged it as the most essential thing in governance, Sarvesh Kaushal, Former Chief Secretary to the Government of Punjab, opened his address on this note. Physical contact h as to be minimised for combating the pandemic. There is no way that any government or any organisation can ignore the online handling of its systems or online delivery when everything has to be done contactless one has to go online. G2C and B2C services ha ve no option but to digitise, he highlighted. Pandemic is a tragedy but for the IT applications, it posed as the biggest opportunity, Kaushal added. When asked about the challenges that the Government faced initially in implementing the IT applications, h e answered, Initially we lacked the backbone infrastructure. We did not have efficient connectivity and in many areas, there was no connectivity at all. Also, there existed huge digital illiteracy earlier. In addition, the hardware was not pocket -friendly , unmanageable in terms of size and was not even available easily. Unfortunately, there was not an equitable spread of IT transformation and most of it was through central funding which started diminishing with time. The institutionalised and standardis ed growth of IT was missing and this caused regional imbalances, he added. Speaking on the growth of IT in the past few years, Kaushal said that there have been excellent models of growth but unfortunately most of them have been silos. So we are basically reinventing the wheel simultaneously at different places, synergy and integration are lacking. There should be a national policy and a state policy which shud be consistent, considering the next 20 to 30 years' vision, deliberated Kaushal. Pointing out a few solutions, Kaushal said, There is a need to devise an open -source mechanism which allows integration of efforts so that officers (district/ city leaders or policymakers) do not end up reinventing the wheel every third year. Emphasising on integratio n and knowledge sharing, he added, When some solution is being implemented in Delhi or Kerala and when it is adopted in Patna, then Patna should not start from scratch but it should start from the level where Delhi is at present. The national response t o the COVID pandemic has brought out the best response in any country including India. The basic governance gets toned up in such times. If all the wheels of governance doing their individual jobs in a complete synergy then technology can be applied to the ir efforts so that their service delivery becomes effortless and contactless, he pointe out. On the way forward, Kaushal said, I visualise a quantum jump as the issues are clearly flagged now, especially after COVID, however, for this we need apt manpower and liberal funds from the Centre. The potential to grow is now being tapped with all the goals, challenges, probable outcomes, clearly flagged. Also, the new generation of officers are digitally literate and hence, I see the next five years will be a rev olution in the application of IT in governance. From http://egov.eletsonline.com 12/01/2020 TOP Upscale Digital Infra to Realise Effective Online Education Shuchi Sharma, Secretary, Higher and Technical Education, Rajasthan addressed the Summit on Challenges & Opportunities in the Education Sector During COVID -19 Situation'. No doubt COVID has put up a lot of challenges, however, the pandemic has given opportunities to come up with innovative solutions as well, she said while opening her address at the summit. Speaking of various challenges surfaced in Rajasthan in the higher and technical education sector, she said, There were a few existing challenges like overall ad missions have reduced in engineering colleges as less number of students are opting for B.Tech courses and admissions in general, have also reduced. The COVID pandemic has weighed on the existing challenges. Now the situation has turned grave and we are fa cing issues like how to rate the students, how to conduct exams, etc. There are guidelines from UGC but the line of action is not clear, she added. Mode of examination has posed a major challenge ahead of the students and the authorities. Earlier, student s were waiting for March for their examination but March opened doors for the unprecedented crisis. Next, a decision to conduct the examinations by Septemeber end was taken which added to the existing challenges. Hence, we raised this with the Ministry of Human Resource and Development (MHRD) to review the decision, Shuchi said. Offline exams were not possible as social distancing norms were likely to be violated if exams were conducted. Also, many students have returned to their hometowns and have to co me back to appear for the exams which will open up a new set of challenges altogether, she added. Further, she pointed out, In Rajasthan, the digital infra is not up to the mark for conducting online examinations. And, to an extent, the situation is the same in most parts of India and worse in rural areas. Fluctuating network speeds, power cuts, inapt digital infrastructure, are some of the hurdles in the way for implementing online education and examinations in the state. However, e -content is the sol ution to overcome such challenges but a need to develop capacity do exist... In Rajasthan, we have started using YouTube as a platform for uploading apt e -content to help students during the COVID -induced lockdowns, Shuchi mentioned. Adding on she said, I asked all the teachers/lecturers to record one lecture on every working day and upload it on YouTube. So, in many colleges, this practice was started... I had emphasised on converting all the written content into e -content so that students can keep up with t heir studies. The possible issues were that one to one online lecture as not feasible, also siblings sharing the smartphone or laptop was another such issue. Hence, uploading of the e -content was one of the possible solutions we figured out. To inform stu dents about the incoming lectures or the time when lectures were being uploaded, WhatsApp groups were formed through which the information was propagated. Resting her words, she said, Shortly, as the digital learning setting in as the new normal for the e ducation sector, there is a need to upscale the digital infrastructure. Also, capacity building programmes need to be conducted for upskilling the teachers n terms of delivering lectures effectively through digital media. And, e -content should be kept in focus as it is one of the easily available and accessible forms of content.

From http://egov.eletsonline.com 12/03/2020 TOP Internal Differences: A New Method for Seeing into Cells Invading cells' private space - prying into their internal functions, d ecisions and communications - could be a powerful tool that may help researchers develop new immunotherapy treatment for cancer. As reported in Cell, a research group at the Weizmann Institute of Science has developed a technology that enables them to see inside tens of thousands of individual cells at once in greater details than ever before. The group, headed by Prof. Ido Amit of the Institute's Immunology Department, applied this method to define the immune cells that infiltrate tumors, identifying a new subset of innate immune cells that collaborate with cancer. Blocking these inhibitory immune cells in mice greatly enhanced the anti -tumor immune response, killing the cancer. Amit and his group had previously made significant inroads into seeing into cells when they developed single cell RNA -sequencing - a means of sequencing all of the RNA in thousands of individual cells at once. The new technique, called INs-seq (intracellular staining and sequencing) - developed in Amit's lab in a project led by res earch students Yonatan Katzenelenbogen, Fadi Sheban, Adam Yalin and Dr. Assaf Weiner - enables scientists to measure, in addition to the RNA, numerous proteins, processes and biochemical pathways occurring inside each of the cells. To do this, they had to develop new methods of getting inside the cell membranes without harming its genetic content. This wealth of inside information can help them draw much finer distinctions between different cell subtypes and activities than is possible with existing metho ds, most of which are able to measure surface proteins only. In fact, Amit compares those existing methods of cell characterization with buying watermelons: They all appear identical from the outside, even though they can taste completely different when y ou open them up. Distinguishing between subtypes of cells that seem identical from the outside, such as inhibitory - versus effector -immune cells, may be crucial when it comes to fighting off cancer. Although the principal groups of immune cells had been id entified many decades ago, there are hundreds of subtypes with many different functions, which haven't been classified. Specific immune subtypes, for example, may play a role in promoting cancer or enabling it to evade the immune system, provoke tissue de struction by overreacting to a virus or act mistakenly in autoimmune syndromes, attacking our own body. Until now, there was no sufficiently sensitive means of telling these apart from other subtypes that appear identical from the outside, says Sheban. In order to sort through these different immune functions inside tumors, the Weizmann scientists used their technology to address an issue that researchers had been trying to resolve for decades: Why does the immune system fail to recognize and kill cancer c ells, and why does immunotherapy for most tumor types often fail? In searching for an answer, they asked whether cancers might hijack and manipulate particular immune cells to defend the cancer cells from the rest of the immune system. The suspicion tha t some kind of immune cell might be actively collaborating with cancer is not as strange as it seems, explains Yalin. Immune responses are often meant to be short -lived, so the immune system has its own mechanisms for shutting them down. Cancers could take advantage of such mechanisms, enhancing the production of the 'shut -down immune cells, which, in turn, could prevent such immune cells as T lymphocytes that would normally kill them from taking action. Indeed, the team succeeded in identifying T -cell-blocking immune cells, which belonged to a general group known as myeloid cells - a broad group of innate immune cells that mostly originate in the bone marrow. Although this particular subset of suppressive myeloid cells was new, it was distinguished by a prominent signaling receptor that Prof. Amit and his group had seen before, called TREM2. This receptor is critical for the activity of the cells that block the actions of tumor -killing T cells; and normally cells bearing this receptor are crucial fo r preventing excess tissue damage after injury or calming an inflammatory immune response. But Amit had also come across a version of this receptor in other immune cells involved in Alzheimer's disease, metabolic syndrome and other immune -related pathologi es. The group's next step is to develop an immunotherapy treatment using specific antibodies that target this receptor and could prevent these immune -suppressive cells from supporting the tumor. Because this receptor is only expressed when there is some type of pathology, says Weiner, targeting it will not damage healthy cells in the body. Preliminary evidence for the TREM2 therapeutics was demonstrated by the scientists in mouse models of cancer with genetically ablated TREM2 receptors. In those mice, tumor -killing T cells came back to life and attacked the cancer cells; and the tumors shrank significantly. If treatment based on this finding is, in the future, proven effective for human use, it might be administered on its own or in combination with o ther forms of immunotherapy.

The move will also include enhancing the capacity of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) in mainstreaming safety and green technologies. The project will support MoRTH construct 783 km of highways in the identified states by integrating safe and green technology designs such as local and mar ginal materials, industrial byproducts, and other bioengineering solutions. The project will help reduce GHG emissions in the construction and maintenance of highways. The agreement was signed by Dr Mohapatra, Additional Secretary, Department of Economic A ffairs, Ministry of Finance, on behalf of the Government of India and Sumila Gulyani, Acting Country Director, India, on behalf of the World Bank. Dr CS Mohapatra stated that the Government of India is committed to environmentally sustainable development i n its infrastructure projects. This project will set new standards in the construction of safe motorable roads. The selected stretches in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh will also help improve connectivity and promote economic development. The National Highways of India carry about 40 per cent of road traffic. The project will also support analytics to map the freight volume and movement pattern on the National Highway network, identify constraints, and provide i nnovative logistics solutions. Several sections of these highways have inadequate capacity, weak drainage structures and black spots prone to accidents. The project will, therefore, strengthen and widen existing structures; construct new pavements, drainag e facilities and bypasses; improve junctions; and introduce road safety features. Also, infrastructure investments are climate -resilient. To this effect disaster risk assessment of about 5000 km of the National Highway network will also be undertaken under the project along with support to the ministry for mainstreaming climate resilience aspects in project design and implementation.

From https://en.trend.az/ 12/14/2020 TOP Oceania AUSTRALIA: PM Morrison Applauds Economic Comeback Australia remains on course to post its first quarter of economic growth this year and the emergence from recession when the national accounts are handed down on Wednesday. Despite some last minute tinkering, economists' forecasts centre on a 2.4 per cent rise in growth during the September quarter, a partial recovery from the massive seven per cent contraction three months earlier. A sp lash of economic indicators released on Tuesday also suggest the December quarter could be buoyant with consumer confidence on the rise again, house prices recovering and employment improving. \"All this demonstrates that the comeback is on,\" Prime Minister Scott Morrison told parliament via video link from The Lodge, where he is isolating after a recent trip to Japan. Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe agreed that recent data have generally been better than expected. \"This is good news, but the recovery is still expected to be uneven and drawn out and it remains dependent on significant policy support,\" Dr Lowe said in a statement following the central bank's final board meeting of the year. As expected, the board left its suite of monetary policy measures u nchanged having cut the cash rate, and other key rates, to a record low 0.1 per cent last month. It also entered into a quantitative easing program for the first time, announcing in November $100 billion of bond purchases over the next six months with the intent of keeping market interest rates low and, in turn, borrowing costs down. Dr Lowe said in the past month, the central bank bought $19 billion of government bonds under the program. He also reiterated the board was not expecting to increase the cash r ate for at least three years given the outlook for inflation and unemployment. The final segments for the September quarter growth result rolled out on Tuesday, including a large $6.3 billion fall in the current account trade surplus to $10 billion. This resulted in exports detracting a relatively hefty two percentage points from growth in the September quarter. \"Despite this and the lockdown in Victoria, the economy almost certainly expanded, with consumer spending able to rebound sharply as a result of the relaxation of restrictions and control of the disease,\" BIS Oxford Economics chief economist Sarah Hunter said. The Australian Bureau of Statistics latest payrolls report shows jobs grew 0.1 per cent nationally in the fortnight to November 14, but by 0 .4 per cent in Victoria. ABS head of labour statistics Bjorn Jarvis said this was the third consecutive fortnightly payroll jobs rise in Victoria, but they remain 5.4 per cent lower than mid -March when the COVID -19 pandemic began. Nationally, payroll jobs are down 2.9 per cent since mid -March. Improving economic conditions has provided a bounce to consumer confidence. The weekly ANZ -Roy Morgan consumer confidence index - a pointer to future household spending - rose 2.9 per cent to its highest level since late February. The index fell in the previous week, which ended an 11 -week run of consecutive gains. \"This could bode well for economic activity and spending over the coming weeks,\" ANZ head of Australian Economics David Plank said. Growing new manufacturi ng orders also suggest a continuing recovery in the sector heading into 2021. The Australian Industry Group's performance of manufacturing index declined 4.2 points to 52.1 points in November, but held above the key 50 points level which separates expansio n from contraction. \"Encouragingly, both new orders and employment continued to grow in November, pointing to the prospect of a continuing recovery as we head towards the end of the year,\" Ai Group chief executive Innes Willox said. From https://au.news.yahoo.com 12/01/2020 TOP Aussies Urged to Embrace Domestic Tourism The federal government is spruiking domestic travel as the summer holidays loom in an attempt to pull the tourism industry out of coronavirus -induced strife. \"Hop on a plane, go interstate,\" Tourism Minister Simon Birmingham told Nine News on Saturday. \"The borders are now open, the tourism operators have got generous terms and conditions in case anything happ ens to make sure you get your money back. \"So you can do it with confidence, head across the country and help support an industry that's so crucial to our nation.\" He said international travel was off the menu for some time so Australians had an opportunit y to explore at home. Western Australia remains the only state with a question mark over its border, as Premier Mark McGowan has yet to decide whether he will reopen to NSW residents as scheduled. WA remains on track to open up to Victoria from Tuesday, dr opping the 14-day requirement for travel from that state. But a decision on whether the NSW border will reopen from the same date won't be made until Monday when further information is available on a Sydney quarantine hotel cleaner's infection. It comes d espite genome sequencing revealing the woman contracted the virus at work, rather than in the community. Travellers from NSW and Victoria have been blocked from entering WA for almost nine months unless they went into quarantine and, until recently, secure d exemptions. NSW had almost reached 30 days without a locally -transmitted case when the quarantine hotel cleaner's case was confirmed, raising concerns she contracted it in the community. But NSW Health on Saturday said the infection was likely linked to her workplace, with viral genome sequencing pointing to US origin. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews is expected to announce a relaxation of mask -wearing rules and increase on social gathering limits on Sunday. Victoria has been free of locally transmitted coronavirus cases for more than a month and with no active cases, has officially eradicated the virus. However, the impressive zero-case run has been achieved while international flights into the state have been diverted since June because of health breac hes in hotel quarantine that caused a second COVID -19 wave. The state's health apparatus and a revamped hotel quarantine program will be put to the test from Monday as international arrivals resume. Meanwhile, Northern Territorians are embracing a new COVI D-19 check -in system with more than 31,000 people downloading the smartphone application in the first week. The system helps health officials trace people who may have come into contact with the coronavirus. On Saturday, no new locally -acquired cases were recorded nationally, while NSW, Queensland and WA each reported a few new overseas virus cases, all in hotel quarantine. From https://au.news.yahoo.com 12/05/2020 TOP Australian Cashless Society Unlikely: RBA Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe doubts Australia will get to the point of being a cashless society but perhaps a \"society with less cash in it\". Dr Lowe told a payments systems online conference that cash still has an important role to play as an emergency payment method. He says there are always stories where a bank's systems have gone down or a merchant's internet is not working so an electronic payment can't be made. \"In almost every case you can guarantee tha t you can use cash to make the payment,\" Dr Lowe told the Australian Payments Network conference. \"So I think many people will want to hold cash.\" However, he said if the electronic system was more resilient, that would probably take away the desire of at least some people to carry $50 or $100 notes in case something goes wrong. \"But we need a payment system that can work when the electronic system isn't working and cash is the best one so far,\" he said. The impact of the coronavirus pandemic has seen the stock of notes in the economy at its highest in at least 50 or 60 years, with strong demand for $50 and $100 notes. Dr Lowe said in the first days of the pandemic people were nervous, some were taking their money out of the bank, although not to the same magnitude of the global financial crisis a decade ago. \"That settled down pretty quickly,\" he said. Even so, many people were taking out a few hundred dollars extra to keep at home just in case something went wrong. \"There was a lockdown and they wanted to make sure they had some kind of cash that they could use to buy the basic necessities\". Dr Lowe said in time he expected the notes to \"come out of the system and back to the Reserve Bank\". The governor made no reference to monetary policy or the state of the economy during his address.

The federal government's agriculture forecaster ABARES on Monday released its latest commodities report which predicts a seven per cent incre ase in 2020/21 production. \"Overall, Australian agricultural production is bouncing back from the drought,\" ABARES executive director Steve Hatfield -Dodds said. Exports are forecast to fall seven per cent to $44.7 billion because of residual effects from d ry years and trade uncertainties. Australian barley and wine have copped the brunt of China's trade action. The anti -dumping measures are likely to reduce wine production value and sales with a lack of access to the key Chinese market. Fruit and vegetable prices are expected to rise in domestic markets due to coronavirus travel restrictions limiting labour available for harvesting. Prices of summer vegetables, stone fruit, apples, pears and table grapes are forecast to rise by between 15 per cent and 25 pe r cent. Agriculture Minister David Littleproud said trade tensions and labour shortages would present challenges to the sector. \"I am particularly concerned at the potential impacts of China's decisions to impose anti -dumping and countervailing duties on b arley and the recent impost of provisional anti -dumping duties on Australian wine,\" he said. Dr Hatfield -Dodds said ebbs and flows in farm production were expected given Australia's variable environment. \"We're expecting a near all -time high winter crop, t he best ever in New South Wales, and a more favourable outlook for summer cropping than we have seen in recent years,\" he said. \"Livestock prices have also stayed high with herd and flock rebuilding, and continued international demand.\" From https://au.news.yahoo.com 12/07/2020 TOP Some Risk Lengthy Unemployment, RBA Warns Some Australians face a prolonged period of unemployment as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic, a Reserve Bank of Australia analysis has warned. It says while the economic outlook is highly uncertain, it is likely that the unemployment rate will remain elevated for a number of years. \"As such, some unemployed people are facing the prospect of a prolonged peri od of unemployment,\" research in the central bank's monthly bulletin says. It says the average duration of unemployment has increased steadily over the 2010s. Currently around one in every five unemployed people has been jobless for more than a year, an in crease from about one in every eight a decade ago. The share of very long -term unemployed people also increased over this period with around 10 per cent having been without a job for two or more years. \"The longer a person is unemployed, the harder it may be for them to find a job,\" it says. \"This could be because they lose skills and networks, there is a stigma associated with being long -term unemployed, or because people become discouraged and leave the labour force.\" Long -term unemployed people are more likely to be older and male and have lower levels of formal education than those who have been unemployed for a shorter period. The research shows the mean average of the long-term unemployed is 37 years of age, with 61 per cent male and with only 11 per cent having a university degree. Labor jumped on the figures, saying it confirms the Morrison government's hiring credit scheme will not help many of the people worst affected by long -term unemployment. The scheme is an incentive for businesses to employ a dditional young job seekers aged 16 -35 years. \"More Australians will be left out and left behind in the wake of this recession because of deliberate and damaging decisions like this,\" opposition employment spokesman Brendan O'Connor and shadow treasurer J im Chalmers said in a joint statement. \"In the deepest and most damaging recession in almost a century, the Australian people deserve a government that chases jobs, not headlines, and doesn't leave workers over 35 behind.\" The Reserve Bank research says lo ng periods of unemployment are associated with lower incomes and financial stress, which can also be debilitating for the individuals, families and communities that are affected. \"For the economy as a whole, long -term unemployment reduces the effective poo l of workers and increases the cost of welfare support,\" it says. From https://au.news.yahoo.com 12/10/2020 TOP Cheap Data and 5G Could Compete with NBN Cheaper data and the roll-out of 5G technology could be a viable competitor to the NBN. Mobile prices fell 17 percent in 2019 -20 thanks to a drop in the cost of entry level plans and significant growth in data allowances, according to the ACCC's annual Communications Market R eport. The consumer watchdog noted a modest 2 percent fall in NBN broadband prices with an increase in the cost of entry level plans tempering the decline. \"The growth in data allowances for mobile services means consumers received better value from their mobile plans,\" chair Rod Sims said.\"Whether this trend continues into 2021 will depend on how strongly mobile operators compete for new customers.\" The ACCC noted that while the 5G footprint is limited, operators continue to invest in roll -out plans to bri ng faster speeds, lower latency and the prospect of greater competition with fixed line broadband services. \"The impact in the mobile market is likely to depend on the willingness of consumers and businesses to upgrade to more expensive devices,\" Mr Simms said. According to comparative website WhistleOut, 5G speeds for home internet vary between around 50Mbps and 300Mbps. In terms of pricing, Optus offer a $75 per month plan capped at 100Mbps which WhistleOut says is cheaper than most NBN 100 Mbps plans. I t also offers a $90 option with uncapped speed and both plans have unlimited data. Telstra charge $85 per month for a 500GB plan currently available on an invite -only basis. \"From my perspective, 5G is far more interesting as an NBN alternative than it is for mobile devices right now,\" WhistleOut Managing Editor Alex Choros said. \"Given the speeds you can achieve for prices similar to NBN 50 and NBN 100 plans, it will be a compelling option for many Australians, especially those struggling with subpar speed s on Fibre to the Node connections or Fixed Wireless. \"As the 5G rollout progresses, it's inevitable NBN Co and NBN providers will have to factor this into how plans are priced.\" In September NBN Co announced it had concluded its initial build and the ACC C said this underlined the importance of commercial access arrangements to encourage competition in retail markets. \"There are promising signs of further consumer benefit as RSPs (retail service providers) take up improved offers strengthened via commercia l negotiation undertaken over the course of our public inquiries,\" Mr Sims said. \"The importance of maximising use of the NBN through improved affordability and strong retail competition cannot be overstated if we are to realise the full economic and socia l benefits of this significant investment.\" From https://au.news.yahoo.com 12/11/2020 TOP Climate Action Calls Spill onto Streets Protesters calling for the declaration of a \"climate emergency\" have clashed with police in Melbourne amid news the federal government is unlikely to rely on \"carry -over credits\" to reach its 2030 Paris emissions reduction target. Some activists glued and chained themselves to each other and the pa vement on Saturday, before being arrested by officers carrying bolt -cutters. \"Australia needs to be a climate lifter, not a climate leaner. We are about to go over a cliff but nobody seems nearly alarmed enough,\" rally participant Miriam Robinson said. \"It has been five years since the Paris Agreement and we are still moving far too slowly to avert global catastrophe. Australia does not even have a coherent national plan, just piecemeal policies and a lot of excuses.\" Saturday's dramatic street scenes follow Prime Minister Scott Morrison's address to a Pacific Islands Forum overnight, during which he hinted the government could ditch the controversial plan to use Kyoto credits amassed before 2020. \"Australia is very confident that we will now achieve ou r 2030 targets without the need to draw on our carry -over credits,\" he told the virtual forum. Australia's emissions are projected to be 29 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 compared with its Paris accord target of 26 per cent to 28 per cent. Labor climat e change spokesman Mark Butler on Saturday accused the government of misrepresenting the data, saying Australia was only on track for a 22 per cent reduction by 2030. He called for the government to commit to net zero emissions by 2050, as New Zealand has, and to work harder to meet the Paris target. \"The government's projections clearly show there will only be a reduction in emissions between 2020 and 2030 of less than seven per cent,\" Mr Butler said in a statement. \"At that rate, it will take 146 years t o get to net zero emissions. \"Electricity is the only sector with considerable emissions reduction and that is due to state government policies and households choosing to install rooftop solar.\" Pacific island nations have long called for Australia and NZ, as regional leaders, to do more on climate. Climate is a sensitive coalition policy area and Mr Morrison has beefed up his language on the perceived emissions credits. \"Those credits that have been earned have been earned by farmers investing in changes,\" he told reporters in Canberra on Friday. The forum comes days after the prime minister confirmed he would not speak at an online summit organised by the United Nations, the UK and France, a move Mr Butler said demonstrated Australia's \"isolation\" on clima te policy. More than 70 nations are speaking at the event, including China, which has recently committed to net zero emissions by 2060. Greenpeace Australia said it was embarrassing the prime minister wasn't speaking at the UN summit. Saturday's protest i n Melbourne included a road block and boats on the Yarra. \"We demand that the government declares a climate and ecological emergency, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero as fast as humanly possible,\" Ms Robinson said. From https://au.news.yahoo.com 12/12/2020 TOP Frydenberg Expects Fast Jobless Recovery Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has cut his unemployment rate forecasts as new figures showed a further 90,000 people found employment in November. This was more than double the number expected by economists and trimmed the jobless rate to 6.8 per cent when it was forecast to remain 7.0 per cent. \"It's terrific news,\" Prime Minister Scott Morrison told 2SM radio shortly a fter the data was released on Thursday. The Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed 84,200 full -time jobs were created in the November, along with 5800 part -time positions. The participation rate of those people in work or seeking employment also rose to 66.1 per cent from 65.8 per cent. The release of the ABS figures coincided with Mr Frydenberg handing down his mid -year budget review. Aside from trimming the budget deficit and upgrading his economic forecasts, the treasurer also lowered the expected p eak for the jobless rate to 7.5 per cent by the March quarter of next year, down from eight per cent forecast in the delayed October budget. Economists at National Australia Bank believe the unemployment rate has already peaked, after hitting a 22 -year hi gh of 7.5 per cent in June. Even so, Mr Frydenberg expects the unemployment rate will recover to its pro -COVID -19 level of just above five per cent in around four years, compared with six years after the 1980s recession and a decade after the 1990s downtur n. \"We have come a long way from Treasury's initial estimate that the unemployment rate could reach 10 per cent or 15 per cent,\" Mr Frydenberg told reporters in Canberra. However, despite this positive news almost one million people are still unemployed. \" The economy is a bit stronger now than the Morrison government and most forecasters imagined in the depths of this crisis, but is still much weaker than it needs to be,\" shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers and Labor's finance spokeswoman Katy Gallagher said in a statement. \"The economy still hasn't rebounded strongly enough or quickly enough for the 2.2 million Australians who are looking for work or more work right now.\" But BIS Oxford Economics chief economist Sarah Hunter says overall the latest job figures c onfirm the recovery is now well -entrenched. \"Not unexpectedly, Victoria is responsible for the majority - 80 per cent - of the increase in employment in November, with the easing of restrictions in Melbourne allowing many businesses to re -open and take on staff,\" she said. However, Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox felt this concentration of jobs growth in Victoria \"illustrates that the pace of jobs growth and recovery in the rest of the country eased considerably in November\". From https://au.news.yahoo.com 12/17/2020 TOP NAB Boss Tips Economy to Fire in 2021 NAB chief executive Ross McEwan expects the Australian economy will be back to pre-COVID level s by the end of next year, but acknowledges some of the bank's customers face a long struggle. Mr McEwan on Friday gave an upbeat outlook to 2021 and cited the September GDP gain of 3.3 per cent and bank research. \"We now think the economy will be back to 2019 growth levels by the end of 2021,\" he told NAB's annual general meeting, held online. \"That's about a year earlier than we previously thought.\" He said the economic activity anticipated late next year equated to the bank's best case scenario from its planning earlier this year. Chairman Philip Chronican said the bank was in a much better economic environment than anticipated a few months ago. Their comments came before most states and territories imposed coronavirus restrictions on travellers from Sydn ey or NSW. An outbreak has infected 28 people in the state capital. NAB has had its challenges. Full -year profit slumped more than 45 per cent amid the pandemic. The organisation also set an additional $1.86 billion aside for bad debts that could arise. N AB reported 90 per cent of customers who had loan repayments deferred, amounting to $60 billion in loans, had since resumed repayments. Yet not all customers are recovering financially. Mr McEwan said he had written to 5.8 million customers in the past few weeks to offer help. \"Most will just need a bit more time to recover,\" he said. \"But some customers' situations have changed permanently.\" Mr McEwan and Mr Chronican were optimistic but guarded about dividends returning to regular levels about a total pay out of 60 cents per share for 2020. \"We will resume paying at higher levels when it's right to do so,\" Mr McEwan said. Mr McEwan has tried to focus the NAB's activities on banking and has reduced the number of projects. He said the sale of MLC Wealth to IO OF, due next year, was the last major structural change. Shares were down 1.87 per cent to $23.40 at 1425 AEDT. From https://au.news.yahoo.com 12/18/2020 TOP Renewed Call for JobSeeker Increase Welfare groups are calling for a permanent increase in JobSeeker payments to bring people above the poverty line as the federal government moves to reduce COVID -19 benefits. The Morrison government plans to lower the JobSeeker unemploy ment supplement by $100 a fortnight from Friday, January 1, and the JobKeeper payment by $200 on Monday. The new rates will be $150 a fortnight for Jobseeker and $1000 for JobKeeper and are effective until the end of March. The Australian Council of Social Service says the move will see vulnerable people trying to get by on $50 a day. The agency has called for a permanent increase of JobSeeker to $65 a day to bring people above the poverty line. \"As 2021 begins and everyone tries to put 2020 behind them, pe ople without paid work will be trying to get by on just $50 a day, which simply isn't enough to cover housing, food, transport and bills,\" ACOSS CEO Cassandra Goldie said. \"The number of people on JobSeeker doubled to 1.5 million during the pandemic and is expected to rise still more when JobKeeper ends in March.\" JobSeeker is scheduled to revert to its pre -coronavirus rate of an \"unliveable\" $40 a day, and the Youth Allowance will be $33 a day, Dr Goldie said. \"People and the economy need security to be a ble to rebuild - virtually every dollar of the coronavirus supplement goes straight back into the local economy, helping to keep other people in employment.\" The federal government has always said the increased payments were a temporary measure which began in March during the nationwide lockdown. They have been extended in staggered reductions. Federal Labor warned it is too early to reduce the payment. \"We are not out of the woods yet with this pandemic and the economic effects, they (are) reverberating ar ound the economy, especially in regional towns and suburbs where there is a lot of casual workers who have borne the biggest brunt,\" Labor's Bill Shorten told Nine's Today Show on Tuesday. \"For the less well off, we shouldn't be cutting their circumstances at this point in time.\" \"The government should reconsider it.\" From https://au.news.yahoo.com 12/30/2020 TOP Australia a Nation of 'Overcomers': PM Prime Minister Scott Mor rison has lauded the courage, resilience and attentiveness of Australians in 2020, saying he has never been prouder of his compatriots after a year blighted by bushfires and COVID -19. Australia is set to endure a subdued New Year's Eve, with people in both Sydney and Melbourne urged to stay at home amid fresh virus outbreaks. It comes after a difficult year in which Australia battled unprecedented bushfires and was forced into virus -induced lockdown for large stretches - including Victoria's deadly second C OVID -19 wave. But Mr Morrison on Thursday said Australians had emerged from those challenges with good grace and geniality, and would hopefully kick on in 2021. \"We proved that once again, we are a nation of overcomers - we're a nation that prevails and we 're making this way through the crisis in a very Australian way, guided by our enduring principles and values,\" he said in a video message. \"Together, we have done better than almost any other country in the world. \"We've found the grit, the ingenuity and the forbearance, and we've been upheld most of all by our wonderful spirit of mateship.\" Mr Morrison in his message thanked all frontline COVID -19 workers including doctors, nurses, aged care workers, mental health support workers and those working in the hotel quarantine program, as well as police and the military. He also warned that Australia would in 2021 need to remain vigilant as it awaits its COVID -19 vaccine rollout and seeks to rejuvenate its economy. \"A safe and effective vaccine validated, prove n by our scientists, doctors, will be available to all Australians and a key step in our recovery,\" Mr Morrison said. \"Stronger, safer, together ... that's the path ahead of us.\" Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese also on Thursday issued a short New Year's Eve message on social media, saying: \"I know 2020 hasn't been the year that any of us wanted. \"But Australians got through it as we always have - by sticking together and by looking out for each other.\" From https:// au.news.yahoo.com 12/31/2020 TOP Economy Set for 2021 Lift Despite Worries Australia's economy faces headwinds in the new year as it continues to grapple with the impact of the coronavirus, but growth is set to pick up earlier and faster. Growth momentum is already returning, and the economic outlook for 2021 looks more positive than it did a few months earlier, economists say. \"Australia has done a better job than just about any other nation in controlling the s pread of the virus,\" Commonwealth Bank chief economist Stephen Halmarick said. \"This, combined with fiscal and monetary policy support being provided to the economy, and the role played by the Australian banking system means the economic impact of COVID -19 has been less severe than in many other nations, and less severe than initially expected.\" That is being reflected in recent data with the economy expanding 3.3 per cent last quarter, record high building approvals, house prices returning to growth, cons umer sentiment at a 10 -year high, and a seven per cent surge in retail spending in November. St George Bank senior economist Hans Kunnen says the current household savings ratio - 18 per cent - is well above what it has been in years and bodes well for the economy. \"It suggests there is a lot of cash out there. This money will now likely be spent in Australia because the borders are shut,\" he said. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg confirmed the speedy recovery when he upgraded economic forecasts while handing down the Mid -Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. The Treasury now expects Australia's economy to grow by 0.75 per cent in 2020/21, rather than contracting by 1.5 per cent as previously feared. The unemployment rate is set to peak at 7.5 per cent, rather than 8.0 per cent, in the March quarter. \"The rebound has been very strong. We would generally expect (economic) growth in the next year to be around 3.7 per cent,\" National Australia Bank chief economist Alan Oster said. In December, Westpac also raised its econ omic growth forecast for 2021 to four per cent, from an earlier estimate of 2.8 per cent. It expects the unemployment rate to taper down to sic per cent by end -2021. \"We now expect that economic activity will return to end -2019 levels by the June quarter n ext year, rather than the December quarter,\" Westpac chief economist Bill Evans said. But economists also caution this momentum could easily reverse. A key factor weighing on policymakers' minds is the winding back of the federal government's Jobkeeper wage subsidy and Jobseeker payments at the end of March. \"That will be a negative. But I do expect there will be some targeted aid towards those industries that are most affected,\" Mr Kunnen said. \"I don't think the government would want to jeopardise recove ry by letting too many businesses fall through the cracks.\" A growing area of worry is the fraught diplomatic relationship between Australia and China and its impact on trade. Agricultural exports have suffered the most damage, as China has restricted Aust ralian coal, cotton, barley, beef, lobster, timber and wine in recent months. But iron ore exports, which account for 7.5% of our GDP, have so far been untouched. A rising Australian dollar is also complicating efforts to gradually withdraw stimulus from t he economy. The Aussie has risen nearly nine per cent this year, to 76 US cents, boosted by strong macroeconomic data and rising demand for Australian minerals. Further gains could hit exports. Westpac is forecasting the Australian dollar to rise to 80 US cents over the course of 2021. The RBA may have to expand its $100 billion bond -buying program to ease pressure on the currency, analysts say, a move that may also help with its 'national priority' of reducing unemployment faster. \"Having entered the worl d of unconventional monetary policy, it is going to be a long time before the RBA can retreat from providing significant support to the economy,\" Mr Halmarick said. From https://au.news.yahoo.com 12/31/2020 TOP Asia -Pacific Continued Fiscal Support and Public Health Action Needed to Make Hope of Recovery a Reality The prospect of a number of COVID -19 vaccines becoming widely available next year has lifted hopes for a faster re covery, but policymakers will need to retain both public health and fiscal support while acting decisively for the momentum to pick up, according to the OECD's latest Economic Outlook. The OECD warned in its June Economic Outlook that a second wave of infe ctions at the end of the year could knock an initial rebound off course. Europe and North America are now bearing the brunt of a resurgence of the virus, stalling the recovery. Global GDP in the fourth quarter of 2020 is expected to be 3% below the same qu arter last year, while for the Euro area and the US the decline is projected to be 7.3% and 3.2%, respectively. Activity will continue to be restricted with social distancing and partly -closed borders most likely remaining through the first half of 2021, t he Economic Outlook says. The global economy is expected to gain momentum only gradually, as vaccines are deployed throughout OECD countries in the course of 2021. After falling sharply by 4.2% this year, world GDP is projected to rise by 4.2% in 2021, wit h China expected to account for over a third of that growth. The recovery will be uneven across countries and sectors and could lead to lasting changes in the world economy. Countries with effective testing, tracking and isolation programmes and where effective vaccinations can be distributed rapidly should perform relatively well, but a high degree of uncertainty persists. The Outlook 5Public Finance provides both upside and downside risks to its main projections. The release of pent-up demand and accumulated savings may reinforce a rebound if vaccines become available faster and more widely, boosting global growth to around 5% in 2021. But confidence may be hit if problems arise with the distribution or unexpected secondary effects of the vaccines and if the lessons f rom the first two waves of the pandemic are not learnt. In this scenario, global growth in 2021 would be lowered by 2\u00be percentage points. Presenting the Economic Outlook with OECD Chief Economist Laurence Boone today, Secretary -General Angel Gurr\u00ed a said: There is hope, but that hope needs to be turned into reality. The pandemic is a global problem. International co -operation is needed now more than ever. Building back better requires leadership and action to build on the promises of vaccines, and to relaunch multilateral negotiations on trade, climate and digital standards to pave the way for a more sustainable growth and a society where opportunities are available for all. Laurence Boone said: With the prospect of vaccines and better virus manag ement, the picture for the global economy is looking brighter, but the situation remains precarious, especially for the low-skilled and for struggling small businesses. Governments have been vindicated in the support they provided to shield people and fi rms. With rock -bottom interest rates expected to persist, governments can and need to sustain it to prevent long-term scarring effects of this crisis. The economic consequences will be with us for years to come. Governments must address decisively the effe cts on the most vulnerable, especially children and the young. (See Summary handout for Economic Outlook news conference.) The Outlook shows how the crisis has worsened inequality, hitting the most vulnerable in society the hardest. High levels of unempl oyment, particularly among the low -skilled and young, risk persisting for years. Many children, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, have fallen badly behind in their education during lockdowns, further limiting their opportunities in the futur e. For millions of small and medium -sized businesses - the main drivers of job creation - mounting debts and continued uncertainty are putting their survival in jeopardy. The Outlook says declines in firms' profits will hit their ability to service debts i n the future and undermine their capacity to invest. Young and small as well as less productive companies are expected to be badly affected, in addition to those in the accommodation and food, transport, and arts and entertainment sectors that are severely affected by the lockdown measures. The economic damage would have been even worse without the massive government financial support now in place to help people and companies weather the shock. With very low interest rates expected to continue for some time , exceptional spending can and should continue until the recovery gains momentum, the OECD says. Policy action should become better targeted to where it is needed most and to strengthen the recovery. The balance of spending should gradually move towards m ore investment in health, education and infrastructure, encouraging a shift to a greener and more digitalised economy, it adds. The Economic Outlook calls for determined action from policymakers across a number of fronts: Strengthen public health servi ces by investing in health workers, prevention strategies and capacity. Implement effective test, trace and isolate programmes. Start planning vaccination campaigns now. Co -ordinate internationally to ensure affordable vaccines and treatments are available wherever needed. Support the vulnerable by expanding social safety nets and improving training for youth and the low -skilled. Ensure that children from disadvantage backgrounds are equipped for the digital age to give them equal opportunities. Support b usinesses by providing grants and equity rather than loans adding to existing debt. Assist companies to invest in their future by, for instance, facilitating the adoption of digital technology. The Economic Outlook warns that corporate debt is reaching le vels last seen in the global financial crisis a decade ago, raising the risk of insolvencies but also cutting firms' capacity to invest, which would weaken a broader economic recovery.

From https://www.oecd.org/ 12/01/2020 TOP OECD Tax Revenues Fall Slightly Before the Covid -19 Pandemic, but Countries Face Much Larger Decreases Ahead, Particularly from Consumption Taxes Tax revenues fell across the OECD for the first time in a decade during 2019, but a much larger decrease is expected in 2020 as the COVID -19 pandemic drives down economic activity and consumption tax revenues, according to new OECD research published today. The 2020 edition of the OECD's annual Revenue Statistics publication shows that the average tax -to-GDP ratio has fallen to 33.8% in 2019, a decrease of 0.1 percentage points since 2018. This was due to decreases in 15 OECD countries that were larger, on average, than the increases in the 20 remaining countries for which 2019 data were available. The COVID -19 crisis is likely to significantly hit tax revenues in 2020, particularly from consumption taxes, due to the sharp fall in economic activity and consumption following lockdowns and the forced closure of m any businesses. Drawing on the lessons from the global financial crisis of 2008, new analysis in Revenue Statistics shows that increases in government consumption and in households' consumption of essential goods will exacerbate this fall in the short - to medium -term. Since the global financial crisis of 2008, we have seen a consistent trend of increasing tax revenues in the OECD, which have decreased slightly in 2019 for the first time, said Pascal Saint -Amans, Director of the OECD Centre for Tax Policy and Administration. We expect to see much sharper decreases next year when the impact of COVID -19 starts to become more apparent. At some point, when the health crisis has passed and the economic recovery is underway, governments will need to reconsider whether their tax systems are up to the challenges of the post -pandemic environment. Revenue Statistics confirms the longstanding diversity in tax -to-GDP ratios among OECD countries, which remained the case in 2019, ranging from 16.5% in Mexico to 46.3% i n Denmark. The largest fall was seen in Hungary (1.7 percentage point), partially due to a decrease in corporate income taxes following the removal of the compulsory tax advance supplement on business taxes. Other large decreases were seen in Iceland (1.1 p.p.), Belgium and Sweden (both 1.0 p.p.). Only one increase of over one percentage point was seen, in Denmark (2.0 p.p.), which overtook France as the country with the highest tax -to-GDP ratio. The data show that corporate income taxes in the OECD have co ntinued to increase, from 9.2% of total tax revenues on average in 2014 to 10.0% in 2018. However, this is still lower than the peak recorded share of corporate income taxes at 11.5% of total tax revenues in 2007 and are expected to fall again as a result of the current crisis. In 2018, average revenues from taxes on goods and services declined in OECD countries: although revenues from VAT remained steady at 20.4% of total tax revenues, excise tax revenues fell by 0.4 percentage points to 7.2%. Consumption Tax Trends highlights that standard VAT rates remained stable between 2017 and 2020, at a record high of 19.3% on average. Only one country increased its standard VAT rate (Japan, from 8% to 10%) in 2019, and no reductions were recorded until the COVID -19 outbreak in early 2020, when Germany and Ireland temporarily reduced their standard VAT rate as part of their economic stimulus packages (from 19% to 16 % and from 23% to 21%, respectively). Many countries have also introduced a range of VAT measures to s upport businesses and the healthcare sector during the crisis, as detailed in a special section of Consumption Tax Trends. The OECD average is unweighted. / The United States is the only OECD country that employs a retail sales tax rather than a VAT as the principal consumption tax.

The surge in e -commerce following the COVID -19 outbreak has emphasised the importance of reform to ensure that VAT is properly applied to digital trade. All OECD countries with a VAT have now implemented or committed to the OECD standards for collecting VAT on online sales of services and digital produ cts. Many OECD countries are further expanding these e -commerce VAT regimes to include online sales of small parcels that are often imported from abroad by foreign electronic marketplaces and other digital vendors.

From https://www.oecd.org/ 12/03/2020 TOP International Community Reaches Important Milestone in Fight Against Tax Evasion New international standards on the automatic exchange of information for tax purposes have so far been satisfactorily implemented by countries wor ldwide, marking an important milestone in the global fight against tax evasion, according to a new report published today by the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes (the Global Forum). The first Peer Review of the Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information shows that 88% of jurisdictions engaged in automatic exchange since 2017 -18 were deemed to have satisfactory legal frameworks in place. The report notes that a second stage of the monitoring process, now unde rway, will assess the effectiveness of automatic exchange in more than 100 jurisdictions. The peer review report was presented during the first day of the annual plenary meeting of the Global Forum, which is bringing together ministers, high -level authorit ies and delegates from more than 100 member jurisdictions. The three -day meeting is focusing on how the tax transparency agenda can promote the fairness of tax systems while strengthening revenue mobilisation. The event will highlight recent achievements a nd challenges in the context of the COVID -19 pandemic. The Global Forum continues to be a game -changer, said OECD Secretary -General Angel Gurr\u00eda. In spite of the COVID -19 crisis, it has successfully delivered on the global peer review process, offering further proof that automatic exchange is becoming the global standard. Ensuring access to financial account information for tax administrations helps ensure everyone pays their fair share of tax, boosting revenue mobilisation for countries worldwide, and particularly for developing countries. In 2019, countries automatically exchanged information on 84 million financial accounts worldwide, covering total assets of USD 10 trillion. EUR 107 billion in additional tax revenues have been identified through vol untary disclosure programmes, offshore tax investigations and related measures since 2009, an increase over the EUR 102 billion figure reported in 2019. The Global Forum Secretariat provided technical assistance in 2020 to 59 developing country members, including training to thousands of officials, as part of efforts to strengthen tax collection capacity worldwide. The battle for transparency is being fought on many fronts, said Zayda Manatta, Head of the Global Forum Secretariat. We are moving fast towa rds full implementation of the existing standards, and taking every effort to ensure all our members benefit from them. From https://www.oecd.org/ 12/09/2020 TOP ADB Affirms Com mitment to Water and Sanitation in Finance Ministers' Meeting The Asian Development Bank (ADB) today affirmed its commitment to water and sanitation investments in the 2020 Sanitation and Water for All (SWA) Asia and the Pacific Finance Ministers' Meeting . We know that every dollar invested in water and sanitation results in a four -fold return, said ADB Vice -President for Knowledge Management and Sustainable Development Bambang Susantono. Together with reduced healthcare costs and greater productivity i n the workplace, water and sanitation investments bring long -term returns to individual households and the wider economy. It also helps reduce inequality and empower women. Representatives of development agencies and finance ministers from Asia and the Pa cific joined the virtual meeting and discussed concrete ways to ensure universal access to water, sanitation, and hygiene. Finance ministers highlighted success stories in the region where governments were able to implement a mix of financing and regulatio n to ensure people's access to water and sanitation, which also generates substantial benefits for the economy, public health, and the environment. Mr. Susantono discussed ADB's $20 billion coronavirus disease (COVID -19) pandemic response package announced on 13 April. A multisectoral Water and Health Advisory Team was also established across ADB to expand water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and hea lth interventions to address COVID -19 through these investments. ADB will invest through 2021 more than $3.4 billion in water supply, sanitation, and wastewater treatment. ADB is also responding with numerous new integrated WASH and health -related technica l assistance, loans, and strategic alliances. Aside from being a pandemic response, ADB's WASH support will also focus on water -related diseases, health, and livelihoods in the long term. The program will be using an inclusive approach targeting vulnerable groups. We remain committed to providing universal access to WASH to tackle the COVID -19 pandemic and build resilience against future pandemics. These are investments for the future of our people, said Mr. Susantono. The SWA Asia and the Pacific Finance Ministers' Meeting is one of three regional convenings organized by the SWA partnership. The co-conveners are UNICEF, the World Bank Water Global Practice, and the Asian Development Bank. From https://www.adb.org/ 12/02/2020 TOP ADB Joins 11 Leading Multilateral Development Banks and IMF in Launching First Joint Report on Financing SDGs The Asian Development Bank (ADB) joined 11 multilateral development banks (MDBs) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today in launching a first -ever joint report on financing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The report is released at the end of a critical year, in which the coronavirus disease (COVID -19) pandemic threatens to re verse progress on the SDGs. In response, MDBs have collectively mobilized a global response package of $230 billion between 2020 and 2021 to reduce the impact of the pandemic, of which $75 billion will be directed to the world's poorest countries before th e end of 2020. As Asia and the Pacific continues its development journey and recovers from the COVID -19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to focus on the core targets of the SDGs, said ADB President Masatsugu Asakawa. Mobilizing domestic financia l resources while ensuring debt sustainability is vital and will allow our partner governments to strengthen social safety nets and invest in high -quality green, resilient, and sustainable infrastructure to benefit the poorest. The joint report highlight s collective and individual MDB efforts to support countries to achieve all 17 of the SDGs. It showcases examples of how their financing directly contributes to advancing SDGs that empower people, protect the planet, foster prosperity for all, and develop sustainable quality infrastructure. The report also emphasizes the critical importance of MDB partnerships to deliver financing, knowledge, and capacity building support for the SDGs. The report concludes that MDBs must continue their efforts to invest in people and human capital, with a deeper focus on inclusion. They will step up their efforts to promote green development and ambitious climate action reflecting the goals of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. They will also work to strengthen resilienc e to shocks and stresses, in order to preserve prosperity and continue to promote sustainable infrastructure, including to foster digitization to support innovation and sustainability. MDBs will continue to deepen their partnerships for the goals, includin g through knowledge sharing and common reporting on the SDGs. The MDBs are committed to working alongside all partner countries to help them emerge from this unprecedented crisis better positioned to achieve the SDGs, the report says. ADB's long -term S trategy 2030 commits that ADB's operations will be designed to help developing member countries meet the SDGs, with the seven operational priorities set out in Strategy 2030 closely linked to SDG goals and targets. ADB's corporate results management system s enable ADB to ensure its projects align with the goals and report on contributions to their achievement. Many ADB projects are focused on supporting the achievement of the SDGs. For example, the ADB Ventures impact platform established in 2020 deploys ve nture capital investments and technical assistance to support early -stage technology businesses intended to have an impact on achieving the SDGs. ADB also partners with the UN and others to support knowledge and policy dialogue that enables developing memb er countries to implement the SDGs. The 12 organizations partnering on the report are the African Development Bank Group, the Asian Development Bank, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the Council of Europe Development Bank, the European Bank for R econstruction and Development, the European Investment Bank, the Inter -American Development Bank Group, International Finance Corporation, the International Monetary Fund, the Islamic Development Bank Group, the New Development Bank, and the World Bank Group (World Bank, MIGA). From https://www.adb.org/ 12/10/2020 TOP $9 Billion ADB Facility to Help Members Access and Distribute COVID -19 Vaccines The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has launched a $9 billion vaccine initiative \u2014the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility (APVAX) \u2014offering rapid and equitable support to its developing members as they procure and deliver effective and safe coronavirus disease (COVID -19) vaccines. As ADB's d eveloping members prepare to vaccinate their people as soon as possible, they need financing to procure vaccines as well as appropriate plans and knowledge to be able to safely, equitably, and efficiently manage the vaccination process, said ADB President Masatsugu Asakawa. APVAX will play a critical role in helping our developing members meet these challenges, overcome the pandemic, and focus on economic recovery. More than 14.3 million positive cases have been identified in Asia and the Pacific, causin g more than 200,000 deaths. As the pandemic persists, economic growth in developing Asia is projected to contract by 0.4% in 2020 \u2014the first regional gross domestic product contraction since the early 1960s. Promoting safe, equitable, and effective access to vaccines is a top priority for ADB's COVID -19 response efforts. Vaccination programs can break the chain of virus transmission, save lives, and mitigate the negative economic impacts of the pandemic by restoring confidence in people's ability to work, t ravel, and socialize safely. The APVAX provides a comprehensive framework and resource envelope for supporting developing Asia's vaccine access, using two complementary components. The Rapid Response Component will provide timely support for critical vacci ne diagnostics, procurement of vaccines, and transporting vaccines from the place of purchase to ADB's developing members. The Project Investment Component will support investments in systems for successful distribution, delivery, and administration of vac cines along with associated investments in building capacity, community outreach, and surveillance. This may include such areas as cold -chain storage and transportation, vehicles, distribution infrastructure, processing facilities, and other physical inves tments. The component may also be used to develop or expand vaccine manufacturing capacity in developing members. ADB financing for vaccines will be provided in close coordination with other development partners including the World Bank Group, World Healt h Organization (WHO), COVID -19 Vaccines Global Access Facility (COVAX), GAVI, and bilateral and multilateral partners. APVAX promotes safe and effective vaccines to be accessed in a fair manner. For a vaccine to be eligible for financing, it must meet one of three criteria. It must be procured via COVAX, prequalified by WHO, or authorized by a Stringent Regulatory Authority. Additional access criteria, such as a vaccination needs assessment, a vaccine allocation plan by the developing member, and a mechanis m for effective coordination among development partners also help ensure that vaccine support under APVAX can be fairly and effectively implemented. ADB is also making available a $500 million Vaccine Import Facility to support the efforts of its developi ng members to secure safe and effective vaccines, as well as the goods that support distribution and inoculation. The facility is part of ADB's Trade and Supply Chain Finance Program. AAA -guarantees available through the program's vaccine import facility w ill mitigate payment risks and facilitate import of these goods. This will employ the same eligibility criteria on vaccines as COVAX. Cofinancing with private sector partners could result in the Import Facility supporting $1 billion in vaccine and related imports within a year. In April, ADB approved a $20 billion package to support its developing members in addressing the impacts of the pandemic and streamlined some procedures to deliver quicker and more flexible assistance. ADB has committed $14.9 billio n in loans, grants, and technical assistance, including $9.9 billion in quick -disbursing budget support from the COVID -19 Pandemic Response Option (CPRO) and support for the private sector. In November, ADB announced $20.3 million in additional technical assistance to establish systems to enable efficient and equitable distribution of vaccines across Asia and the Pacific. From https://www.adb.org/ 12/11/2020 TOP ADB Approves 2021 Administrative Budget The Asian Development Bank (ADB) today approved a 2021 administrative budget (internal administrative expense budget) of $771.2 million. This represents a 4.7% increase over the 2020 administrative budget, consisting of a price incre ase of 4.2% and a volume growth of 0.5%. The 2021 budget will support ADB's work program, which includes estimated commitments of $21.2 billion for sovereign operations, $2.1 billion for nonsovereign operations, and $384 million for technical assistance. I n addition, it will support ADB's $9 billion Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility approved today. ADB is committed to supporting our members' response to the COVID -19 pandemic and we have taken a highly prudent approach to preparing the 2021 budget, drawi ng on lessons learned this year, said ADB President Masatsugu Asakawa. Importantly, this budget allows flexibility to respond to alternative scenarios as well as to enable ADB's support to enhance COVID -19 vaccine access by our developing members. The m ain cost drivers in the 2021 budget include items related to COVID -19 response, additional information technology requirements, and support for resident missions. From https://www.adb.org/ 12/11/2020 TOP New Approaches Needed in PRC on Green and Blue Finance, for Sustainable Growth, Webinar Told New approaches are needed to generating green and blue finance and managing catastrophic risks in the wake of the global public health crisis and economic shocks created by the coronavirus disease (COVID -19), participants at a webinar heard today. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) organized the webinar on \"Expanding Green Finance, Blue Finance, and Disaster Risk Financing for Innovative Operations\" to discuss key financial measures required to improve financial and economic resilience and sustainability in the wake of COVID -19, and identify innovative financial sector operations in the People's Republic of China (PRC). This year marks the e nd of the 13th Five -Year Plan (FYP) in the PRC. As the country prepares to enter a potential new era of growth, it needs to continue its largely successful efforts in greening its production, lifestyles, and environment and building an ecological civilizat ion, participants heard. We need to explore a new set of green and blue financing instruments, particularly in support of environmental sustainability, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and green transformation, said ADB Director General for Eas t Asia James P. Lynch introducing the webinar. Discussions such as those we are having today will help us identify ways we can work together to help both propel and safeguard PRC's ongoing social and economic achievements. In September 2020, the PRC's Pr esident Xi Jinping made international commitments at the UN General Assembly for the PRC to peak CO2 emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. The communique for the 5th annual plenary session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist P arty of China held on 29 October 2020 further highlighted that one of the objectives of the 14th FYP is to reduce carbon intensity to peak carbon emissions by 2030. ADB's new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS with the PRC will begin next year and align in its time frame and core objectives with the 14th FYP. Mr. Lynch said that green development will feature prominently in the strategy, and climate change resilience and environmental sustainability are expected to be central pillars. As the current ADB co untry partnership strategy with the PRC ends, we also want these discussions to generate practical ideas for even more innovative financial sector operations under the next CPS, Mr. Lynch said. The webinar used a hybrid approach with participants from gov ernment and academia from Beijing joining in situ at the Shang -ri La Hotel, and ADB staff joining online from Manila. From https://www.adb.org/ 12/16/2020 TOP East Asia CHINA: Invest ing over 4 Bln Yuan to Boost Tourism, Culture for Rural Poor China invested about 4.3 billion yuan (around 656 million U.S. dollars) in boosting cultural progress and tourism development in impoverished rural areas during the 13th Five -Year Plan per iod (2016 -2020), an official with the Ministry of Culture and Tourism said Wednesday. The grants were used to fund opera performances, purchase facilities for cultural centers in rural areas, and support tourist projects in impoverished regions, said Li Qu n, vice minister of culture and tourism, at a press conference. So far, China has trained more than 10,000 cultural specialists for deeply impoverished areas, Li added. More than 700 special training courses have been launched to empower the rural poor so that they can rise above poverty by developing culture and tourism, Li said. From http://www.new s.cn/ 12/23/2020 TOP JAPAN: Gov't Considering \u00a5 20 Tril Extra Budget to Spur Virus -Hit Economy Japan is considering compiling a third supplementary budget totaling about 20 trillion yen ($192 billion) for the current fiscal year as part of efforts to bolster the coronavirus -hit economy, government sources said Monday. The extra bu dget for fiscal 2020 through March is also intended to assist companies' efforts to cut carbon dioxide emissions, improve the country's disaster preparedness and help companies maintain employment, the sources said. Senior lawmakers of Prime Minister Yoshi hide Suga's Liberal Democratic Party have been calling for a large -scale auxiliary budget to finance fresh fiscal stimulus as the country faces a resurgence of coronavirus infections. Suga has pledged to reduce Japan's greenhouse gas emissions to net -zero and achieve a decarbonized society by 2050. The budget is expected to be submitted to an ordinary parliamentary session to convene in January, during which an initial budget for fiscal 2021 will also be deliberated. The Diet already passed two supplementa ry budgets for fiscal 2020 totaling 57.6 trillion yen for anti -virus measures under the government of Suga's predecessor Shinzo Abe, who stepped down in September for health reasons. However, the pandemic kept the output gap, a measure of the supply -demand balance in the economy, at minus 6.2 percent in the July -September quarter. Tokyo reported a total of 9,857 new coronavirus infections in November, topping the August level by around 1,700 to hit a record monthly high. Seemingly endless infections have hi t other parts of Japan as well with the country on Saturday posting a daily figure of 2,684 new cases, while 472 serious COVID -19 cases were confirmed Monday, both record highs. From https://japantoday.com 12/01/2020 TOP Suga Pledges \u00a5 2.2 Tril to Promote Ecological Businesses Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga pledged a 2 trillion yen ($19 billion) fund on Friday to promote ecological businesses and innovation to achieve his goal of zero net carbon emissions by 2050. Suga, who took office in mid -September, set climate change as one of his main policy goals along with promoting a digital transformation of Japanese society \u2014 issues which were left behind by his predecessor, Shi nzo Abe, who resigned because of ill health. The fund is to bolster environmental investment as we aim to become a global leader in this area, Suga said. He pledged to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 in a policy speech in October, though it will be a m ajor challenge given Japan's significant reliance on fossil fuel. Suga, in his first full-fledged news conference since taking office, said Friday that his cabinet plans next week to approve an economic package that will also include 1 trillion yen ($9.5 billion) to promote the country's digital transformation \u2014 a weakness that Japan recognized when companies were requested to allow employees to work from home in response to the coronavirus and many were unable to. Although he is known for a pragmatic appro ach to getting things done, it's unclear whether Suga has the political heft to overcome vested interests in weaning the resource -poor nation from its reliance on imported oil and gas. He said Japan needs to strive to become a global leader in achieving ca rbon neutrality, and that investment in the environment is a growth opportunity, not a burden. Suga repeated that he plans to deepen Japan's alliance with the United States and promote a vision of a Free and Open Indo-Pacific to counter growing Chinese i nfluence in the region. From https://japantoday.com 12/05/2020 TOP Japan's FY2021 Budget to Hit Record High of over \u00a5 102.66 Tril Japan's initial budget for fiscal 2021 will tot al more than 102.66 trillion yen ($986 billion), a record high for the ninth straight year, mainly due to an increase in the amount of reserve funds to fight the coronavirus pandemic, government sources said Wednesday. In addition to setting aside 5 trilli on yen for the funds, which the government can spend without parliamentary discussion, the budget for the year starting in April has been enlarged to deal with rising social security and defense outlays. The sources said the total, compared with the curren t fiscal year's 102.66 trillion yen, may even surpass 105 trillion yen. Additional debt issuance to finance the upcoming budget will further deteriorate Japan's fiscal health, the worst among major developed countries. Public debt exceeded 1,100 trillion y en as of the end of fiscal 2019, more than double the gross domestic product. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's cabinet is expected to approve the draft general -account budget late this month. It will be submitted to an ordinary parliamentary session to be c onvened in mid-January. Amid the economic fallout from the pandemic, the government is expected to issue more new debt for the next fiscal year. In fiscal 2020, tax revenue is expected to total about 55 trillion yen, the sources said, far short of the gov ernment's initial projection of 63.51 trillion yen due to poor corporate earnings. New government bond issuance is on track to top 100 trillion yen for the first time in the current fiscal year. The government has already decided to issue new debt worth ab out 90.2 trillion yen for the year, as its total annual spending, also including the first and second supplementary budgets, has swelled to over 160 trillion yen. Apart from the pandemic -related factors, spending on social security in the coming fiscal yea r will increase by a few hundred billion yen from the current year as the population rapidly ages, according to the sources. In recent years, the costs for pensions and other social welfare services have accounted for about a third of Japan's initial budge t. The country's defense expenditure in fiscal 2021, meanwhile, is expected to top 5 trillion yen for the sixth consecutive year to possibly surpass the record 5.31 trillion yen in fiscal 2020, according to the sources. From https://japantoday.com 12/10/2020 TOP BOJ to Explore Better Ways to Hit Price Goal; Extends Fund Scheme The Bank of Japan on Friday unveiled a plan to examine more effective ways to achieve its 2% inflation target, following in the foot steps of its U.S. and European peers as a renewed spike in infections threatened to derail a fragile recovery. As widely expected, the central bank kept monetary policy steady and extended by six months a range of measures aim ed at easing funding strains of companies hit by COVID -19. In a surprise move, the BOJ said it will look at ways to make its policy \"more effective and sustainable,\" as the blow to growth from the pandemic pushes inflation further away from its target and forces it to maintain its massive stimulus longer. BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the review will be more a fine -tuning of its market operations and asset purchases, rather than an overhaul of its yield curve control (YCC) policy. But he said the central bank was open to introducing new tools and reviewing the way it buys exchange -traded funds (ETF) to address the potential side -effects of prolonged easing. \"We will examine operations under yield curve control and our asset purchases,\" Kuroda told a briefing. \"It's true this is an extraordinary policy for a central bank,\" he said of the BOJ's ETF buying. \"It's therefore necessary to examine ways to make this step effective and sustainable.\" The BOJ will announce the findings of the review in March. The move underscores a growing concern among policymakers over the diminishing return and rising cost of prolonged easing. Years of ultra -low interest rates have crushed commercial banks' margin, while its huge asset buying has drawn criticism for drying u p liquidity and distorting market pricing. \"The BOJ won't change its policy framework but may review components such as its ETF buying, bond purchases and its view on what constitutes an appropriate yield curve,\" said Yasunari Ueno, chief market economist at Mizuho Securities. At the two -day rate review ending on Friday, the BOJ kept intact its YCC targets of -0.1% for short -term rates and 0% for 10 -year bond yields. With the pandemic still hurting the economy, the BOJ decided to extend its fund -aid progra m, deployed in March through May to deal with the immediate hit from COVID -19, by six months. The package includes increased purchases of corporate debt and a lending scheme to channel money via banks to small firms. The central bank said it is ready to ex tend the deadline of the package further if needed to support the economy. Japan's economy rebounded in July -September from its worst postwar contraction in the second quarter, though the third wave of infections is dampening prospects for a strong revival . The pandemic has added to headaches for major central banks including the ECB and Fed, which have conducted reviews on how to better battle a protracted low-growth, low -inflation environment with their dwindling policy ammunition. Data released earlier in the day showed core consumer prices dropped at their fastest pace in a decade in November, stoking fears of a return to deflation and keeping policymakers under pressure to take stronger steps to prop up growth. Having conducted its own comprehensive re view of its policy framework in 2016, the BOJ has argued there was no need to do another examination despite missing its 2% price goal for years. Kuroda stuck to the view, stressing that he had no plans to tweak the BOJ's yield targets or abandon negative rates. \"We won't be weakening our monetary easing. Rather, we're examining ways to make our monetary easing more effective.\" From https://japantoday.com 12/18/2020 TOP Japan Pre pares for Digital Currency, in Line with China and Others Japan is gearing up preparation for the issuance of digital currency in both public and private sectors following swift moves by China and some other countries to do the same. Virtual money issued by central banks around the world is called \"central bank digital currency\" or CBDC, and is used for cashless payments via smartphones or electronic cards just as cash, while some private organizations, including one established by Facebook, also plan to i ntroduce their own digital currencies. Different from credit cards and cashless payment services, digital currencies are expected to provide retailers commission -free payment systems while end -users are able to not only settle payments at stores but also q uickly send money to others via their smartphone apps. One of the leading central banks for a CBDC has been considered the People's Bank of China, China's central bank. It has accelerated its efforts to create the \"digital yuan\" this year as the coronavirus pandemic hit the country, rolling out pilot programs that provided 200 digital yuan ($31) to each of 150,000 citizens selected by lottery in Shenzhen in October and Suzhou earlier this month. \"China has prompted moves toward digital currency (around the world),\" said Hiromi Yamaoka, a former senior official in charge of payment and settlement systems at the Bank of Japan. \"It (has done so at) surprising speed, as central banks tend to take a cautious stance\" for a new system, he added. Yamaoka s aid he expects the Chinese central bank to officially issue the digital yuan by 2022, when it will host the Beijing Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games. He is also pushing to issue a private -sector driven digital currency, currently chairing the \"Digital C urrency Forum\" in Japan, which started a joint study for developments with around 30 major companies including Japan's three megabanks of MUFG Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp and Mizuho Bank. In the fall, news reports of an emergence of a couple of dig ital currencies stunned the financial world. In October, central banks of the island state of Bahamas in the Caribbean Sea and Cambodia in Southeast Asia started to issue their CBDCs named \"Sand Dollar\" and \"Bakong,\" respectively. \"We are seeing a once -in-a-millennium change in the history of currencies after the long -time use of currency notes following the world's first introduction in China about 1,000 years ago,\" said Masashi Nakajima, a professor at Reitaku University and a former BOJ official. Nakajim a said advances in technology including blockchain to counter cyberattacks and counterfeiting have largely contributed to the realization of digital currencies while people are now able to bring utilize their smartphones to use CBDCs anywhere at any time. Major central banks including the BOJ, the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank as well as the Bank for International Settlements released a joint report in October, saying the group of central banks will collaboratively explore potential pro motion of innovative payments. \"A CBDC could be an important instrument for central banks to fulfill their public policy objectives and to evolve in step with the wider digitalization of people's day-to-day lives,\" it added, but no major central banks hav e yet officially decided to introduce a CBDC. The BOJ has said it will launch a feasibility study on its digital currency in fiscal 2021 starting in April. \"The bank considers it important to prepare thoroughly to respond to changes in circumstances in an appropriate manner,\" it said in a separate report. \"Demand (for a CBDC) could be suddenly strong. We aim to be prepared well to respond to changes in our environment,\" BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda told business leaders in Osaka in September when asked abou t digitalization in Japan's payment systems. But the BOJ is likely to take some years to decide whether to officially issue its digital currency, as are other major central banks. \"The design of a CBDC is very tricky and delicate,\" Yamaoka said. \"In advan ced countries, a CBDC could conflict with existing payment and banking systems.\" For example, the credit card business could lose ground if consumers and retailers prefer CBDCs, which do not request application forms or commission fees. Commercial banks co uld face \"disintermediation\" with a lower amount of deposits if people are inclined to hoard more CBDCs for convenience by converting money from their bank accounts, leading them to have fewer funds to lend money to companies and be reluctant to do so, exp erts said. But Reitaku University's Nakajima takes an optimistic attitude, saying setting the upper limit for transactions is one of the solutions. \"When each of the 100 million people (out of 126 million in Japan) owns a tentative upper limit of 50,000 ye n in the digital currency, the total amount would stand at 5 trillion yen,\" he said. \"This figure accounts for only 5 percent of cash circulating in Japan. I don't think the digital yen will affect commercial banks so much when the upper limit is imposed. \" Yamaoka's Digital Currency Forum plans to start a feasibility study for its virtual currency next year, aiming at bridging the various existing cashless payment services and boosting interoperability by offering their \"common\" digital currency. Yamaoka s aid the consortium hopes to create \"some form\" of digital currency, similar to Facebook's Diem plan, by 2023 while seeking collaboration with the BOJ to develop technologies if possible. \"Japan would lag behind other countries if we take a wait -and-see sta nce until the rollout of the BOJ's CBDC,\" said Yamaoka, stressing that his consortium will aim to match the innovation for digital currencies in the world, even though the BOJ will take several years to issue its CBDC. \"We hope Japan leads (other major cou ntries) for digital currency. The leader takes advantages.\" From https://japantoday.com 12/27/2020 TOP SOUTH KOREA: To Revamp Taxation, Set Up Fund for Carbon Neutrality Goal South Korea said Monday it plans to overhaul a taxation scheme related to carbon emissions and set up a fund designed to fight climate change in a bid to achieve the goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. The country also plans to accelerate the reduction of reliance on coal as it nurtures eco -friendly industries and builds up the low -carbon economic structure to effectively reduce carbon emissions to zero by that year. President Moon Jae -in announced in October that the country will seek to go carbon neutral by 2050 in an effort to transform the country's fossil -fuel reliant economy into an eco -friendly one. Carbon neutrality has emerged as a global agenda for fighting climate change since the Paris climate accord went into effect in 2016. Major countries, inclu ding the European Union, China and Japan, have unveiled the timeline for their carbon zero goals. The Korean government unveiled its commitment to \"proactively\" respond to climate change challenges and strategies in achieving carbon neutrality. The move gained urgency as South Korea heavily relies on fossil fuels and its backbone industries -- manufacturers, steelmakers and the petrochemical segment -- are traditionally high carbon emitters. The finance ministry said the country plans to overhaul the carbon pricing system after taking into account related taxes, financial burdens and carbon -emission trading scheme. It will also set up the tentatively named Climate Response Fund. \"As for (the introduction of) carbon taxes, the government plans to c onsiderably review many factors, including the fallout on climate, income distribution, inflation and industrial competitiveness,\" Finance Minister Hong Nam -ki said at a press briefing. \"But at the current stage, it is not desirable to mention details abou t whether to introduce carbon taxes or raise taxes on diesel,\" he added. The country plans to seek to support technical development in various fields, including power generation and transportation, in a bid to spur the early reduction of greenhouse gases, according to a joint statement by the finance, industry and science ministries. In a related effort, the country will accelerate its efforts to scale down dependence on fossil fuels and further develop green energy sources such as hydrogen and renewable en ergy. Of the country's power generation sources, coal accounted for 40.4 percent as of end-2019, followed by liquefied natural gas (LNG) with 25.6 percent and nuclear power with 25.9 percent. The country will also strive to support high -carbon emitting industries to help them transform to the low -carbon economic structure. It will back up the development of eco -friendly cars and nurture new industries to take the lead in such segments as rechargeable batteries and power -efficient chips, according to the ministries. The initiative is part of the Moon government's efforts to shift its energy policy from nuclear and fossil fuel -based power generation to renewable energy sources, such as solar power, under its nuclear phase -out policy. The carbon neutrality c ampaign is also in line with the government's Green New Deal drive being pushed to achieve sustainable growth through eco -friendly policies. The country said it will seek to slash the emissions of greenhouse gases in 2030 by 24.4 percent from the 2017 leve l. The government said it plans to set up a presidential committee on a carbon -neutral campaign to push for the vision as it seeks to draw up detailed action plans starting next year.

The country's public sector debt, known as D3, which includes the debt of the central government and state -funded firms, came to 1,132.6 trillion won as of end -2019, up 5.1 percent, or 54.6 trillion won, from the previous year, according to the Ministry of Strategy and Finance. The on -year increase in the public debt represents the highest growth rate since the 6.5 percent gain recorded in 2014. The 2019 tally accounted for 59 percent of the country's gross domestic product last year, up 2.2 percentage points from a year earlier. General government debt (D2), which covers the central and provincial governments, and nonprofit public institutions, reached 810.7 trillion won, up 6.7 percent, or 51 trillion won, from a year earlier. Its percentage of the GDP climbed 2.2 percentage points to 42.2 percent last year. The ministry said general government debt increased in 2019 from the prior year due to a decline in tax revenue and increased government bond sales. Asia's fourth -largest ec onomy had the sixth -lowest D2 -to-GDP ratio among 33 members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The OECD average stood at 110 percent.

The BOK will also take its \"market stabil ization measures\" in foreign exchange and financial markets in a timely manner, while seeking to sign currency swap deals with central banks of other countries, according to the statement. The global economy is expected to show a \"modest recovery\" next yea r, helped by progress in vaccine developments and stimulus measures by advanced economies, the BOK said. South Korea's economy is likely to grow at around 3 percent next year, but uncertainties remain due to a global resurgence of the virus, the BOK said. The BOK's monetary policy direction also came as the country's consumer prices are expected to rise 0.5 percent from a year earlier in 2020. The BOK expects consumer prices to grow 1 percent next year, but that too will fall far short of its long -term tar get of 2 percent. Last month, the BOK held its policy rate unchanged at a record low of 0.5 percent, while slightly revising up this year's economic outlook, amid growing concerns over the nation's third wave of coronavirus infections. Driven by signs of a modest recovery in exports, the BOK revised up this year's economic growth outlook to a 1.1 percent contraction, compared with a previous forecast of a 1.3 percent retreat.

The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) said the latest GIR level represents an adequate external liquidity buffer, which can help cushion the domestic economy against external shocks. \"This buffer is equivalent to 11.2 months' worth of imp orts of goods and payments of services and primary income,\" the BSP said in a statement, adding it is also about 9.3 times the country's short -term external debt based on original maturity and 5.3 times based on residual maturity. The BSP said the month -on-month increase in the GIR level reflected inflows mainly from its foreign exchange operations and income from its investments abroad. However, the BSP said these inflows were partly offset by the foreign currency withdrawals the national government made t o pay its foreign currency debt obligations and revaluation losses from the BSP's gold holdings resulting from the decrease in the price of gold in the international market.

The Bangko Sen tral ng Pilipinas (BSP) said that the interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities were likewise kept at 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively. BSP Governor Benjamin Diokno said the monetary board's decision was based on its assessmen t that the inflation environment remains benign, the BSP said. He said the latest baseline forecasts have risen slightly due to the sharp increase in global crude oil prices and the higher -than-expected food inflation in November. However, since the rise i n food prices is transitory, he said it is expected that the future inflation path will remain firmly within the government's 2 to 4 percent target over the policy horizon. \"The balance of risks to the inflation outlook also leans toward the downside from 2020 to 2022 owing largely to potential disruptions to domestic and global economic activity amid the ongoing pandemic,\" Diokno said in a virtual briefing. Meanwhile, he said the inflation expectations remain broadly consistent with the inflation target. He said the board noted that the resurgence of COVID -19 cases globally has tempered economic activity with the reimposition of preventive measures in recent weeks. However, he said that optimism over the delivery of vaccines has lifted market confidence, s upporting improved prospects for global growth. On the domestic front, he said the board also observed early indications of improved mobility and sentiment. \"While recent natural calamities could pose strong headwinds to growth, the further easing of quara ntine measures should help facilitate the recovery of the economy in the coming months,\" he said. \"Given these considerations, the Monetary Board is of the view that monetary policy settings remain appropriate,\" Diokno said. He said the board believes that an accommodative monetary policy stance, together with sustained fiscal initiatives to ensure public welfare, should quicken the economy's transition toward a sustainable recovery.

When emergencies like this strike, life changes in a moment, said Naomi Kitahara, UNFPA Representative in Vi t Nam. This natural disaster has already destroyed thousand s of homes and forced people to flee. Women and girls are among the most vulnerable. Women do not need to die giving birth, and this must hold true even in emergencies. While fleeing, people are in need of basic necessities, ranging from food and water t o hygienic supplies and medical care.. UNFPA is striving to assist the Government in restoring and improving the lives of flood victims, particularly the most vulnerable. UNFPA expresses sympathy for victims and their families affected by the latest trage dy, especially women and girls. This contribution underlines our solidarity with the people of Vietnam, many of whom have suffered the loss of homes, livelihoods, and belongings in the wake of the devastating floods. According to the joint rapid assessme nt carried out in October, in which UNFPA experts played a lead role in the most affected areas of central Vi t Nam, health facilities have been hit hard by floods and landslides, and routine public health programmes such as antenatal, delivery, post -natal care and family planning services have been disrupted. Women and girls continue to be unable to access basic healthcare services, including sexual and reproductive health. The disaster forced women and girls to move to evacuation centres without having ti me to pack essential supplies. They are unable to manage their hygiene properly as a result and lack access to basic needs such as sanitary pads, clothes, and underwear, which are needed to manage their menstrual periods. In addition, access to water and p laces to wash and dry reusable pads and clothes, or to dispose of used materials, is currently challenged. The UNFPA funding and support includes the distribution of Dignity Kits, with essential hygiene items, along with vital maternal health equipment (su ch as the Doppler Foetal Heart Rate Detector, which detects the heartbeat of a pregnant woman's foetus). In addition, UNFPA is supporting the delivery of mobile and outreach sexual and reproductive health services, as part of the wider health sector respon se to violence against women and girls in flood -affected areas.

Based on the request for anti -dumping measures by representati ves of the domestic manufacturing industry, the Ministry launched an investigation of the case on September 3 last year. Due to the complicated development of the COVID -19 pandemic and a number of issues which need clarification related to the product rang e, the ministry issued Decision No 2240/Q -BTC on August 21 this year to extend investigation period. But because of the inability to conduct the on -site investigation of foreign manufacturing and exporting companies, the ministry sent a questionnaire for firms to provide additional information and documents to explain and clarify contents provided in the preliminary stage and give opinions on the case. The investigation results showed that the amount of investigated cold -rolled steel imports amounted to 27 2,073 tonnes during the period, accounting for 65.5 per cent of the total cold -rolled steel imported into Vi t Nam. The domestic manufacturing industry was under threat of considerable damage, reflected in most indicators, especially profit, inventory and market share, the ministry said. Besides, the dumping margin of imported goods is determined from 4.43 per cent to 25.22 per cent. On the basis of the results, the Ministry of Industry and Trade issued the decision to apply the official anti -dumping tax on cold-rolled steel products from China to prevent and minimise damage to the domestic manufacturing industry due to impacts from a large amount of imported cold -rolled steel products being dumped into the country.

From https://vietnamnews.vn 12/25/2020 TOP New Tax Policy for Ride -Hailing Services Sets Off Storm Earlier thi s month the Government's amendment of tax regulations for ride -hailing services, which increases the tax they actually pay, was a topic of hot debate in the media. With effect from December 5 ride -hailing firms have to pay value added tax (VAT) of 10 per c ent on the fares passengers pay for a ride unlike earlier, when they only had to pay the 10 per cent on their revenue after paying the drivers' 80 per cent share of the fare. The drivers then paid 3 per cent VAT on their 80 per cent share. Under the new ta x regime, the effective rate is more than double the old one of around 4.4 per cent. Drivers' incomes are estimated to have fallen by around 7.3 per cent. Policy makers said the changes are aimed at rationalizing the tax regime for ride-hailing companies, treating them as transporters to create a level playing field for traditional taxi firms. For a long time it was not clear if ride -hailing companies were considered to be technology service providers or transport companies, but the new decree makes it clea r they are the latter. The ride -hailing market in Vi t Nam saw substantial growth of 57 per cent between 2015 and 2019, the highest in South East Asia, Grant Thornton said, quoting a study by Google and Temasek. This growth drew the attention of Vietnames e tax authorities, who have been making efforts to develop a mechanism to collect tax from tech -based drivers on incomes generated from the ride -hailing business, it said. An official from the Department of Tax Administration for Small and Medium Enterpris es and Individuals said VAT rates for ride -hailing companies like Grab and Gojek had so far been too low and tax authorities need to raise them to the correct level. The 10 percent VAT rate would be appropriate for ride -hailing firms since they operate lik e transport companies, she said. Many experts agree with the changes, saying the new tax regime creates a level playing field for ride -hailing firms and traditional taxi operators. But the changes have led to other controversies as Grab, one of the biggest ride-hailing firms in Vi t Nam, decided to hike fares. On the same day the new decree to change the taxes took effect (December 5) it increased fares by 5 -6 per cent, saying it wanted to protect drivers' incomes. Taxi fares in major cities and provinces l ike H\u00e0 N i, Bc Ninh, HCMC, B\u00ecnh Dng, ng Nai and C n Th went up by VN2,000 to VN27,000 for the first two kilometres. In H i Ph\u00f2 ng, Qu ng Ninh and \u00e0 N ng they rose by VN3,000 to VN25,000. For each subsequent kilometre the fares were increased by V N500 - 1,000. GrabBike fares increased from VN3,400 to VN4,000 per kilometre after the first two kilometres. The company also decided to increase its commission on taxi fares from 28.3 per cent to 32.8 per cent, including an app service fee of 25 per ce nt. For bikes, it increased from 25 per cent to 27.2 per cent, including an app service fee of 20 per cent. The hikes in fares and commissions have sparked arguments among drivers, customers and experts. Two days after Grab announced the changes hundreds o f GrabBike drivers turned off their app and gathered outside the company's office in H\u00e0 N i to protest and demanding a return to the old rates. Consumers Nguy n Ng c Nga of HCMC's District 2 said she used Grabbike to go to office daily due to the convenience and promotions, which made the fares reasonable. I got a shock as my daily fare increased from VN40,000 to over VN50,000. She said she was consider ing using public transport from now on. Tr n Th Thu H ng of District 3 said to visit her daughter in District 1 the GrabCar fare is now VN45,000, VN9,000 -10,000 higher than before. Most of us have seen incomes severely affected by the Covid -19 outbreak , and so we will have to reconsider the use of this service. Many other customers have been making similar comments and started comparing ride -hailing fares with traditional taxi and motorbike taxi services before booking. Grab drivers Drivers said the fare increase is likely to force customers to opt for competing services and business has already fallen significantly. Nguy n Xu\u00e2 n Cang of Long An Province has worked as a Grab driver for more than a year in HCMC. I support the Government's tax payment p olicy but I expect Grab to share the tax burden with drivers. We insist on Grab's taking that the company should go back to the old 20 per cent commission rate. An increase of 2 or 3 per cent may be fine, but over 7 per cent as the company just did is too much. But a Grab spokesman blamed the Government's new tax policy for reducing drivers' incomes. He told online newspaper VnExpress that if his company did not increase fares, drivers' incomes would decrease by around 7.3 per cent, and the hike would kee p it at just 1 per cent. The new fares still ensure Grab's competitiveness in the market. The company also had plans for more promotions, he added. According to Nguy n Th\u00e1 i H i V\u00e2 n, general director of Grab Vietnam, Decree No.126 has a number of provisi ons that are not suitable for ride -hailing services, and this has contributed to increasing ride costs and affecting drivers' incomes. The country is going through a difficult time, and the new tax policy therefore has an impact not only on drivers but als o customers and the company. On December 11 Grab wrote to the General Taxation Department protesting against its decision to amend the VAT regime even for motorbike drivers. It said Decree 10 that came into force in April covered only the automobile transp ortation business but not motorbike taxis. The new VAT policy had badly affected Grabbike drivers' incomes and many had stopped working in protest, it said. What is the impact on other ride -hailing firms? Vit Nam also has many other app -based motorbike taxi services like Gojek, Aber, FastGo, VATO, Mygo, and be Group JSC. Five days after Grab adjusted its fares and commission rates, Gojek also announced fare and commission hikes for some of its services. For instance, the fare for GoRide for up to two kil ometres has been increased by VN1,000 to VN13,000 in H\u00e0 N i, and VN11,000 in HCMC. Analysts say people pay the 10 per cent VAT on all kinds of goods and services, including traditional taxi services, and so the 10 per cent VAT for ride -hailing services like Grab is nothing out of the ordinary. They only had reservations about the timing, saying most sectors are struggling to cope amid the downturn caused by the COVID -19 pandemic, and so there has been a sharp increase in joblessness and decrease in peopl e' incomes. So a tax hike that causes a spike in the price of any product or service will simply make people stop spending on it, they point out. It has been going on for nearly a month but the last of the story has not been heard yet.

From https://en.trend.az/ 12/17/2020 TOP Oceania AUSTRALIA: More Job Gains Expected, Budget in Review There are two key events before economists and investors start winding down for year-end - jobs figures and the mid -year budget review. Thursday's labour force report for November is not expected to be the blockbuster seen in the previous month, when there was a surprising 178,800 surge in the number of people employed, aided by a return to work in Victoria as its lockdown ended. For November, economists' forecasts centre on a 40,000 increase in employment. The unemployment rate is expecte d to remain at seven per cent, still shy of the spike to 7.5 per cent seen in June and during the depths of the pandemic, which was the highest level in 22 years. But this would still mean nearly a million people are without a job. An analysis by the Reser ve Bank last week warned that while the economic outlook remains highly uncertain, it is likely that the unemployment rate will remain elevated for a number of years. \"As such, some unemployed people are facing the prospect of a prolonged period of unempl oyment,\" it says. Currently around one in every five unemployed people has been jobless for more than a year, an increase from about one in every eight a decade ago. The mid -year budget review - or the Mid -Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO) to give i t its formal title - is due at some stage this week. It comes just weeks after the Treasurer Josh Frydenberg's 2020/21 budget was handed down in October, which was delayed from May due to the pandemic. Even so, there has been some significant developments in that short space of time. The economy's rebound from recession has been stronger than expected, as has the rise in employment, while confidence among Australian and business confidence has gone through the roof - a key pointer to future activity. \"(MYEFO) is likely to see an upgrade to the growth outlook and a downgrade to the budget deficit projections, reflecting stronger revenue flows and slightly less emergency spending than expected in the budget,\" AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver said. Dr Oliver expects growth for 2020/21 will be upgraded to flat (0.0 per cent) from a 1.5 per cent contraction and the jobless rate revised down to seven per cent from 7.25 per cent for the financial year. He also predicts the budget deficit for 2020/21, wh ile still huge, will be $200 billion rather that $214 billion. \"Hopefully peak deficit has been seen, but peak debt will be years away,\" he says. An analysis by the independent Parliamentary Budget Office last week predicted net debt would still be $1.3 tr illion in 2030/31 compared to just $374 billion in 2018/19. Meanwhile, the Australian share market looks set for a flat opening on Monday after Wall Street was kept in check by the lack of an aid package from Washington and rising levels of COVID -19. The US S&P 500 index slipped 0.1 per cent to 3,663.46, the Dow Jones Industrial Average managed a 0.2 per cent rise to 30,046.37 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.2 per cent to 12,377.87. Australian SPI 200 futures were down one point at 6630. On Friday, the Au stralian S&P/ASX200 benchmark index closed 0.6 per cent down at 6642.6 after CSL chose not to continue with its coronavirus vaccine. But it still managed to rise 0.1 per cent on the week, its sixth consecutive weekly gain. From https://au.news.yahoo.com 12/13/2020 TOP Potential Tax Incentive for Career Change The challenges of an ever -changing labour market have prompted the federal government to consider tax incentives for Australians to change careers. A discussion paper published on Friday is calling for stakeholders' views on whether tax deductions on education and training expenses unrelated to a person's current job could support their future employment. \"People no long er expect a job for life, and may have multiple careers over their lifetime,\" the paper from Treasury says. \"The increased rate of globalisation and technological change, the changing nature of work and the labour market are among the forces driving the ne ed for continued upgrading of skills throughout life.\" Currently, Australians can only access tax deductions on study and materials related to their current field of work, the expectation being that further training increases career progression and therefo re, income. The policy idea aims to boost Australians' employability and income security by diversifying their skills and was announced as an initiative to be consulted on in the 2020 -21 budget in October. The discussion paper says the policy would only b enefit those who are able to pay upfront costs of training and who are already employed with an income against which tax could be deducted. \"Low -income earners, including those outside the workforce, with little or no income tax liability would not benefit from a new income tax deduction,\" the paper says. Organisational behaviour expert Ann Brewer told AAP she was concerned the government's proposal would exacerbate the gap between \"haves\" and \"have nots\". Because the scheme would require a person to alread y have an income, it could not help the underemployed or the unemployed, she said. As the head of education transformation for the NUW Alliance - a collaboration between the universities of Newcastle, Wollongong, Western Sydney and UNSW - Prof Brewer has researched what forms of re -training actually work. The research overwhelmingly indicated that reskilling was best achieved when it was employer -sponsored, on -the-job training, she said. \"Government sponsored training has moderate effects whereas training linked to current or prospective employment has far greater value and is more likely to lead to productivity and better outcomes,\" she said. University of Sydney Business School's John Buchanan said there was more demand than ever for Australians to have c omplex skills to make them employable in the long term. The types of work Australians do had changed dramatically in three decades, illustrating the need for improvement in this area, he said. In 1986 about two -thirds of the Australian workforce was in th is kind of \"routine\" work, compared with about half the workforce now. Prof Buchanan said he doubted the government knew how best to give people the right mix of skills because it had already shown an \"instrumental\" approach to further education. He referr ed to the Morrison government's decision earlier this year to increase funding subsidies for perceived high -need courses such as nursing, teaching, engineering and IT, to the detriment of arts and humanities degrees. From https://au.news.yahoo.com 12/13/2020 TOP ASX Rises 1.16pc After Jobs, Budget Boost Shares on the ASX had their best day since late November, as the heavyweight sectors and dollar were boosted by better emplo yment and budget reports. The S&P/ASX200 benchmark index closed higher by 77.5 points, or 1.16 per cent, to 6756.7 on Thursday, after mixed results in US trade. The gain was the best since November 24. The closing position was the highest for the index sin ce February 25. The All Ordinaries closed better by 83.4 points, or 1.21 per cent, to 7000.1. The materials sector, which includes miners, added 1.6 per cent as iron ore prices remained above $US150 a tonne. Financials climbed 1.08 per cent. There were helpful contributions from energy, up two per cent, and information technology, which gained 3.34 per cent. Investor optimism was helped by the unemployment rate falling to 6.8 per cent in November as a larger -than-expected 90,000 people joined the workforce. Economists had forecast a 40,000 rise in employment and jobless rate of seven per cent. A stronger than expected recovery from the COVID -19 recession has helped to wipe billions of dollars from the federal budget deficit. The mid -year economic review showed the deficit for the 2020/21 financial year is forecast to be $197.7 billion, rather than the $213.7 billion from October's delayed budget. The Aussie dollar had spikes towards 76 US cents after both sets of figures were published. Westpac's head of for eign exchange Richard Franulovich said the improvement came as the US dollar was down across the board. \"The broader environment is a negative one and the Aussie is making hay,\" he said. Australian government bond yields edged higher and Mr Franulovich sai d investors were reappraising Australia's economic recovery. Deep Data Analytics chief executive Mathan Somasundaram doubted the jobs data and budget update meant much to shares investors. He believed the JobKeeper wage subsidy masked the reality of emplo yment. He said the ASX rise was influenced by it being the day of the month when options expired for futures trading. Traders set new index levels, which produced substantial moves in trade, he said. \"People are taking a guess on where the market will be,\" Mr Somasundaram said. On the ASX, Fortescue was best of the big miners and closed up 2.0 per cent to $22.41. In banking, ANZ was best of the big four. Shares closed up 1.29 per cent to $23.58. Freedom Foods sold its cereals and snacks operations to Arnott 's for $20 million as it focuses efforts on dairy, nutritional and drink products.

From https://au.news.yahoo.com 12/17/2020 TOP Deficit Trimmed on Better Economic Outlook A stronger than expected recovery from the COVID -19 recession has helped to wipe billions of dollars off the federal budget deficit. The mid -year review released on Thursday shows the deficit for the 2020/21 financial year is now forecast to be $197.7 billio n, rather than the $213.7 billion announced in October's delayed budget. However, the shortfall still remains the largest on record as a result of the pandemic. Handing down the Mid -Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook on Thursday, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg al so upgraded his economic forecasts. The economy is now expected to grow by 0.75 per cent in 2020/21, rather than contracting by 1.5 per cent as previously feared, while the jobless rate is expected to peak at 7.5 per cent in the March quarter, down from ei ght per cent forecast in the budget. \"Today's budget update confirms that the Australian economy is rebounding strongly,\" Mr Frydenberg told reporters in Canberra. The unemployment rate for November, also released on Thursday, unexpectedly fell to 6.8 per cent from seven per cent in October. But shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers said despite some slightly better figures, the defining features of the budget update were still record deficit, a record trillion dollars in debt and weaker wages growth. \"The economy is recovering but it isn't rebounding strongly enough or quickly enough for the 2.2 million Australians who still don't have a job or can't find the hours that they need to support their loved ones,\" Dr Chalmers told reporters in Canberra. An ongoing reco very in consumption and investment is expected to be underpinned by continued improvements in confidence and a further easing of social distancing restrictions. Stronger economic growth, resulting in higher tax receipts and a lower number of people receiv ing the JobKeeper wage subsidy, has helped to absorb additional policy decisions to support the recovery and $1.6 billion to secure access to COVID -19 vaccines. These supports includes $3.2 billion to extend the temporary JobSeeker coronanvrius supplement, $1 billion for aged care and $241 million to extend the HomeBuilder program. Despite a spike in the iron ore price to over $US150 per tonne in recent weeks, budget assumptions still anticipate the price falling to $US55 per tonne next year, albeit three m onths later than predicted in the budget. \"Underpinning the MYEFO forecasts today are our continued prudent commodity price assumptions,\" Mr Frydenberg said. Business Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott says the government has softened the blow of the worst of the pandemic but now it is time for the private sector to take over the heavy lifting. \"To do this we have to drive new investment across the country with the right tax incentives, stop the antiquated industrial relations system w orking against job creation, wind back unnecessary red tape, get big infrastructure projects happening quickly and fix the skills system,\" she said in a statement. Global credit rating agency Standard & Poor's said the financial indicators in the budget up date are within the tolerances of Australia's AAA rating. \"We believe high iron ore prices are providing some benefit to the general government budget, as will the country's relatively quick economic recovery,\" S&P said in a statement. \"(But) it will take years for a substantial fiscal recovery to occur in Australia.\" The agency has Australia's top -tier rating on a negative outlook, saying that risks remain tilted toward the downside.

From https://au.news.yahoo.com 12/30/2020 TOP Australian Tariff Cuts to Expand Exports Australian exporters battered by an increasingly bitter trade dispute with China can pin their hopes on tariff cuts with key trading partners to help fill the void. Cuts delivered by Australia's network of free trade agreements on Friday should fuel export expansion and job growth, Trade Minister Dan Tehan said. Australia's relationship with China faltered last year, with the economic powerhouse launching trade strikes and tariffs o n $20 billion worth of lucrative Australian exports including beef, wine and barley. Live seafood, cotton, timber and coal were also caught in the crosshairs. With no signs of a breakthrough in the tension, Australia is strengthening agreements with countr ies including Canada, Korea and Indonesia from January 1. \"Reducing trade barriers will boost export opportunities for Australian farmers and businesses in key export markets, which translates to more jobs and economic growth in Australia,\" Mr Tehan said. Beef exports to Canada increased by 92 per cent to reach $33 million in 2019 -20 with more to come. \"Australian fresh or chilled beef exporters will benefit from further cuts to Canadian tariffs in 2021 under the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans -Pacific Partnership,\" Mr Tehan said. Tariff reductions on Australian sheep and goat meat exports to Korea also grew eight per cent, to reach $169 million, with tariffs on those products to be slashed from 6.7 to 4.5 per cent. Under a bilateral free trade agreement with Indonesia, Australian honey exporters will benefit from tariffs being cut from 3.25 to 3 per cent in 2021, with sales having already increased 191 per cent to $808,000 in 2019 -20. \"International trade helps create jobs and drive econom ic growth, and the Morrison government has focused on negotiating free trade agreements in the national interest,\" Mr Tehan said. Prime Minister Scott Morrison meanwhile continues to lobby for a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The pair last spok e during a G20 Summit in Osaka in June 2019. Mr Morrison says Australia is always looking for opportunities to discuss tensions but agreeing to meet is a matter for the Chinese government. From https://au.news.yahoo.c om 12/31/2020 TOP Asia -Pacific Urgent Action Is Needed to Reduce Over -Fishing and Reform Support to the Fisheries Sector Urgent action is needed to reduce over -fishing, improve fisheries management and reform support to the sector, or th e world will fail to meet a key United Nations goal on the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans and marine resources, according to a new OECD report. The OECD Review of Fisheries 2020 updates and analyses the OECD fisheries support estimate (FSE) database, the most comprehensive, detailed, and consistent collection of country level data on governments support to fisheries reported by governments. The latest Review shows that at least a quarter of global fish stocks with known status are overfished and a third of fishing activity is not adequately managed, jeopardizing attainment of UN Sustainable Development Goal 14 and the health of our ecosystems. Current fisheries policies are part of the problem: over the 2016 -18 period, the 39 countries in the Review reported spending USD 9.4 billion annually in support to fisheries, accounting for about 10% of the value of catches. Over a third of this support lowered the cost of fuel, vessels and gear, which frequently encourages overfishing. Governments s hould stop subsidising fishing inputs, directing support to helping fishers operate their businesses more effectively and more sustainably, said OECD Secretary -General Angel Gurr\u00eda. Countries have an opportunity to come together at the WTO in an agreemen t to reduce harmful fisheries subsidies. They must do so, to refocus efforts and limited resources to ensure the protection and sustainability of our oceans, marine biodiversity and the livelihoods of coastal communities. The report also provides the late st information about illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing, which undermines the effectiveness of management and threatens the sustainability of fish stocks. While there has been significant progress over the past fifteen years in fighting IUU fishing, particularly on implementation of port state measures, more needs to be done to improve the transparency of vessel registration and authorisation processes; the stringency of transhipment regulation; the market measures to increase traceability; a nd to close markets and fisheries services to IUU fishing operators. Effective management of fish stocks is crucial for the economic, social and environmental sustainability of the sector. Yet policy is lagging in many countries. Only about two -thirds of management mechanisms directly control reported catches and landings, and only about a third of countries and economies use total allowable catch limits (TACs) in all the management processes they report on. How support is given matters. With the COVID -19 pandemic continuing to be a major source of 6Private Sector disruption and uncertainty across the entire seafood sector, governments need to continue providing support to the sector. However, the Review shows that support is most effective and supportive of sustainable fi sheries when it is time -limited, targeted, cash -based and consistent with longer -term sustainability objectives. Drawing on experience across major fishing countries, the Review argues that government policy action can make the fisheries sector more produc tive, sustainable and resilient by: Moving away from policies that support inputs and unsustainable capacity towards those that help fishers operate their businesses more effectively in a sustainable manner, and increase their revenue (e.g., through educ ation and training), or that provide direct income support in a way that does not incentivise unsustainable fishing. Addressing regulatory loopholes and moving towards internationally recognised best practices to fight IUU fishing. Investing in sufficien t capacity for management, control and surveillance to effectively and sustainably manage fisheries, including in the high seas, and to eradicate illegal fishing.

The Asia -Pacific region represents more than 45 percent of the global chemical manufacturing business or an equivalent of 7 percent of global gross domestic product. Of the 120 million jobs supported by the industry, more than 69 percent o f them are in the Asia -Pacific, according to the American Chemistry Council. Chemicals are a critical part of many essential goods. In fact, 96 percent of all manufactured goods rely on chemistry, said Sergio Barrientos, industry co -chair of the APEC Che mical Dialogue. From masks and other personal protective equipment to hand sanitizer and crucial disinfectants, the chemical industry plays an essential role in producing important supplies in the fight against COVID -19, he added. Government and industr y representatives convened virtually in early November and discussed top priorities in the chemicals sector as well as a plan of actions moving forward, including prioritizing collaboration between public and private sectors to develop innovative solutions for sustainable economic, and environmental and social development through the application of good regulatory practices. Through its virtual working group, the APEC Chemical Dialogue forum advances APEC's agenda on trade and investment by promoting regula tory alignment and convergence to the globally harmonised system of classification and labelling of chemicals and encouraging thesharing of information and best practices on the sound management of the industry. One of the key areas of interest in the for um is good regulatory practices, said acting government co -chair, Renee Hancher. When applied uniformly and consistently, good regulatory practices produce more effective and efficient regulatory outcomes, prevent unnecessary obstacles to trade caused by regulations and provide a more predictable regulatory environment that encourages trade and investment. The forum promotes cross -cutting collaboration to bolster development of and investment in innovative solutions to land -based waste management and en sure coherence on marine debris initiatives with the APEC Oceans and Fisheries Working Group and other APEC fora. The forum recently reiterated their commitment to join the global effort in mitigating the impact of COVID -19 by providing essential materials needed to fight the pandemic, in the Asia -Pacific region as well as globally. Collaboration between industry and government drives a forward -thinking agenda and contributes to a more coherent regulatory environment for chemicals in the Asia-Pacific, prom otes higher health, safety, and environment standards, and prevents barriers to trade, Barrientos concluded.

Telework has also been expected to help reduce congestion for commuters and for the time not spent commuting to be effectively used for work or leisure. The Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry should present easier -to-understand guidelines regarding labor management, personnel evaluations, health maintenance and cost burdens including communications fees, based on problems that have been revealed as many companies have introduced teleworking. While some industries and professions can make it easier for wor kers to start telecommuting, such as those related to the tech sector, others cannot, such as sales staff who focus on face -to-face communications with customers, and medical workers who take care of patients. A good combination of commuting to work and working from home should help telecommuting take root. With the management and labor sides both devising ideas, companies are encouraged to explore working styles that can suit the realities of their operations. At some companies that started teleworking in haste, employees have been forced to use home computers and communications devices and there are many cases in which the companies have been harmed by cyber -attacks.

Architect Khng Vn M i, former chairman of the HCM City Association of Architects, said that facilities in the underground space would relieve pressure above ground and provide additional parking space as well security and defense. Underground spaces connecting metro lines and public transport vehicles will be important, and the main metro stations should have many services, with underground tunnels connecting markets, trade centers, and others, he said. The city's current planning projects include underground space at Qu\u00e1 ch Th Trang Square and the 23.9 park that will connect to metro stations in the B n Th\u00e0 nh area in District 1. On the streets of L\u00ea L i, Nguy n Hu , and H\u00e0 m Nghi, more services will be developed to attract tourists, and on T\u00f4n c Thng Street, a parking area will be built and a pedestrian street will connect the metro station in the Ba Son are a and waterway transport along the S\u00e0 i G\u00f2 n River. The basements of hotels and shopping centres along these streets should be connected with each other and to metro lines, experts have said. Financing is the biggest obstacle for underground space planning, Mi said, adding that the city faces a budget shortfall for above -ground space. He said the city should call on the private sector for additional investment in underground space planning. Experts have said that foreign consultants should be hired because they have practical experience in planning and spatial design. However, collecting initial data should be done by a local consultant because they will understand the actual situation and be able to research geological information and collect data for under ground projects, M i said. While waiting for the complete underground space planning, the city also needs to collect information about existing underground facilities such as parking lots and shopping centres so that new management regulations can be draw n up.

From https://vietnamnews.vn 12/09/2020 TOP South Asia INDIA: Pega Develops New System for Bavarian Government to Aid SMEs amidst COVID -19 Outbreak Pegasystems Inc. (NASDAQ: PEGA), the software company empowering digital transformation at the world's leading enterprises, has announced the development of a new application and process system for the Bavarian Government to provide emergency COVID -19 fina ncial aid to self -employed workers, farmers, and small to medium -sized companies. Hosted in secure, scalable data centres by T -Systems, the solution will allow those eligible for assistance to apply through an entirely digital process, which will accelerat e the distribution of funds where they are most needed. Pega worked alongside the Bavarian Ministry of Economic Affairs and T -Systems to develop the system in just five days. I'm proud of how quickly we were able to build this system, said J\u00f6rg Scholz, v ice president public sales and head of IT business, T-Systems. As of April 7, more than 108,500 Bavarian companies had already used the application to apply for the assistance. With this new online procedure, we will be able to speed up the processing of applications to the district governments and the state capital of Munich, said Hubert Aiwanger, Bavarian Minister of Economic Affairs. I would like to thank Pegasystems and T -Systems for their extremely high level of commitment to helping self -employed workers, farmers, and businesses in need get the relief they need more quickly, he added. The solution, developed with the highly configurable low -code capabilities of the Pega Platform, replaces the existing process, which required applicants to manuall y complete, scan, and email documents to the application centres. The new process allows applicants to enter their data online, which enables administrators to review and approve claims far more quickly. Payment orders for successful applicants are then au tomatically forwarded to the relevant administrative staff of the Free State of Bavaria and the City of Munich before a payment notification is generated and received by the approved self -employed workers, farmers, and businesses via email. The system also allows government staff to access the application from their workstation at home - which would be problematic in the old manual system. In addition, it offers a statistical evaluation of the speed and efficiency of the application process, which will allow the ministry to refine and improve it further in the weeks ahead.

They'll learn everything they need to about making it in a tough space and emerge stronger and more investible. They'll be linked directly with banks, investor s, and service providers as well as CBSL. Eventually, they will become products that will hugely improve how we access finance in Sri Lanka and beyond. Especially now, that the country is waking up to the need for digital financial solutions to meet their daily needs. Everyone benefits, and everyone learns.

From https://en.trend.az/ 12/13/2020 TOP Oceania AUSTRALIA : Services Sector Lifts as Restrictions Ease The relaxing of coronavirus restrictions has given a further boost to the services sector, which is now enjoying conditions not seen for a year. The Australian Industry Group performance of services index rose a further 1.5 points to 52.9 points in November, another improvement in conditions after a slump for much of the year. An index reading above 50 points indicates the sector is expanding. Four of the five sectors covered by the report expanded during November, with o nly retail and hospitality continue to contract. \"Sales, new orders, employment and deliveries improved as activity restrictions eased and businesses ran down their inventory levels,\" the report released on Monday said. \"Improved conditions and a boost in sales was mainly due to greater movement of goods and people as restrictions across borders and within Victoria eased.\" The report follows a run of largely positive data over the past week, which suggests the economy will finish the year on a relative hig h after enduring the first recession since the early 1990s. The national accounts posted last week showed the economy had expanded by 3.3 per cent in the September quarter, rebounding from the nation's record seven per cent contraction in the June quarter. Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe's initial response to the figures, while facing a parliamentary committee last Wednesday, was \"good\". The Reserve Bank is not expecting the growth rate to return to its pre -COVID levels until the end of 2021. \"If we keep getting numbers like that it will be a bit quicker,\" Dr Lowe said. The governor is preparing to deliver a speech on payment systems to industry figures on Monday. ANZ will also release its monthly job advertisement report for November, a pointer to future employment. Job ads rose by a further 9.4 per cent in October, but were still down 13.5 per cent from their February level prior to the onslaught of the coronavirus pandemic. From https://au.news.yahoo.com 12/07/20 20 TOP New Car Dealership Rules 'Doomed to Fail' The federal government's guiding principles to help manage relations between car companies and their dealers is a \"do -nothing policy\" that is \"doomed to fail\", the Australian Automotive Dealer Association says. At the same time, the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries has described the new measures as a classic example of overreaction and an effort to maintain the government's \"cosy relationship\" with dealers. T he six best practice principles were released on Friday, providing for a voluntary framework on issues such as compensation and dispute resolution. The government said the measures struck a balance between better protecting car dealers while ensuring Austr alia remained an attractive investment prospect for vehicle manufacturers. But AADA chief executive James Voortman said the government had sided with multi -national companies at the expense of the nation's car dealers and their 60,000 employees. \"It is cl ear that car dealers in Australia desperately need a strong set of mandatory protections which protect against the abuses from car manufacturers,\" Mr Voortman said. \"What we have today is a do -nothing policy cynically released on a Friday afternoon. \"The v oluntary approach being announced by the government is doomed to fail and the potential damage that can be done before these principles are reviewed in two years' time is immense.\" FCAI chief executive Tony Weber said government's measures were unhelpful, with the commercial environment in the sector already governed by a raft of regulatory checks and balances covering all parties. \"Steps by the government and dealers to deter change and innovation will come at the expense of consumers,\" he said. \"Like ever y other part of the retail economy, the way customers wish to buy vehicles is changing. \"This change should be encouraged by government, not hindered to maintain a cosy relationship with car dealers.\" Among the six best practice principles, car companies are urged to include provisions for fair and reasonable compensation to dealers if they withdraw from Australia or rationalises their network. This should include allowances for loss of profits, wind up costs and unrecovered capital expenditure. They also called for agreements to allow time for dealers to secure a return on their investments and for companies to buy -back or compensate dealers for vehicle inventories, parts and special tools. The final principle said agreements should include provision for t imely resolution of disputes. Their release pre -empts a Senate inquiry report due in March next year which has also looked at the issues between dealers and car companies following this year's departure of Holden from the local market. The inquiry was est ablished to review the circumstances in which General Motors decided to retire the Holden brand, effectively ending 185 dealer agreements, and heard how many Holden dealers felt compelled to take what they considered to be inadequate compensation. It has s ince expanded to more broadly explore the relationship between car manufacturers and dealers and has heard of issues with other vehicle brands. In a joint statement, Industry Minister Karen Andrew, Employment Minister Michaelia Cash and Assistant Treasurer Michael Sukkar said the guiding principles were designed to deliver the best outcome for Australian consumers. \"The government has worked to balance the need to better protect car dealers with an environment that is attractive to manufacturers to invest i n our nation - as well as ensuring the best deal for everyday Australians buying vehicles,\" the ministers said. From https://au.news.yahoo.com 12/11/2020 TOP Mining, Energy I ndustries Eye Jobs Bonanza More than 24,000 jobs could be created across almost 100 mining, oil and gas projects likely to start over the next five years. Resources and energy employer group AMMA has detailed the jobs bonanza in a groundbreaking report an alysing federal government major projects data. Based on 98 projects worth a combined $84 billion considered likely to proceed, the 22 linked to coal will be the largest driver of growth, with around 8000 new production jobs. Nine iron ore projects could l ead to 5000 jobs, the report predicts. There are 20 gold mining projects considered likely to start by 2026 and 14 in gas and petroleum. AMMA chief executive Steve Knott said the forecast of 24,400 new operational -phase employees was highly conservative. \" It only factors in projects either already committed or very close to receiving final investment decision,\" he said. \"When considering the construction workforces required to build these projects and the flow -on effects throughout the supply chain, it's reasonable to expect the true impacts of this investment pipeline to be well over 50,000 jobs.\" Forecast mining occupations include 9233 plant operators, 3014 heavy diesel fitters and 4484 engineers, geologists and other technical roles. Oil and gas occupa tions include 952 trade technicians, 532 production technicians and operators and 487 management and supervisory roles. AMMA is hoping its report helps government to determine emerging skill shortages and inform people about career opportunities. Under the projections, Australia's direct resources and energy workforce would grow more than 10 per cent, propelling the industries past 260,000 employees for the first time since February 2014. The Morrison government last week introduced a bill to parliament wh ich would allow more eight -year enterprise agreements on major projects. Mr Knott said the proposed changes to greenfields agreements would offer stable industrial arrangements for the length of major construction phases. \"This simple improvement will make a massive difference to getting the $84 billion worth of advanced projects, and their potential to bring more than 24,400 new jobs, over the line,\" he said. Unions have criticised the threshold of $250 million, arguing greenfields deals should only be for major resources projects worth more than $5 billion. The ACTU is concerned workers' right to strike and take other industrial action could be hampered on smaller sites like hospitals. An additional 192 projects, worth around 35,000 jobs, are listed as bei ng early in feasibility stages and not included in the report. From https://au.news.yahoo.com 12/16/2020 TOP Fashion Stores Act on Supply Chain Poverty David Jones and Best & Less are among the major fashion brands that have committed to a measure to help protect the wages of workers who make their clothes. The Australian retail chains have published pledges to \"ringfence\" labour costs in price negotiations with their interna tional suppliers. Ringfencing means garment workers' pay will be listed as a separate line item in negotiations and contracts between the brands and the factories that make the clothes. This helps protect the workers' wages. Anti -poverty charity Oxfam Aust ralia has congratulated the two retailers along with Country Road and Hanes, which owns Bonds, on the development. \"This is vitally important,\" Oxfam Australia's chief executive, Lyn Morgain, told AAP. \"For the women who make our clothes, we're ensuring th at the big brands are not using their power in negotiations to effectively drive worse conditions.\" Ms Morgain said the move adds transparency, showing how much money is going towards labour costs and insulating them from downward pressure on prices. A li ving wage is calculated based on a person working 48 hours a week and earning enough money for their basic daily needs. Oxfam has been campaigning for better treatment of garment workers in Southeast Asia, who make clothes Australians wear. In November, th e charity published a report evaluating how retailer business practices affected the quality of life among Bangladeshi garment workers, most of whom are women. H&M ranked highest of the brands surveyed, while the companies behind Just Jeans and Rivers had room to improve. At least 19 other major fashion brands have promised to ringfence labour costs, Oxfam says. They include H&M, Big W and Cotton On. Oxfam is on Friday launching an advertising blitz in shopping centres to raise awareness of low wages in th e fashion industry. Ms Morgain said this week's development showed brands are aware that consumers don't want to \"wear poverty\" and are informing themselves about the ethics of retail supply chains. \"We've got a number of brands that have been, if you like , intransigent...They are making a calculated risk that the market doesn't care and I wonder whether their shareholders would share that view. \"Because there's an awful lot of evidence now, and you can see it in the behaviour of the other brands, that it i s increasingly a part of the value proposition of a brand. There are risks in being associated with poverty wages.\" From https://au.news.yahoo.com 12/18/2020 TOP "}
