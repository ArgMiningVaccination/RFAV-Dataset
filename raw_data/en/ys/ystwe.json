M. Dietz1&D. van Author(s) 2017. This article is an open access publication Abstract Kawasaki disease (KD) is a pediatric vasculitis with coronary artery aneury sms (CAA) as its main com- plication. The diagnosis is based on the presence of persistent fever and clinical features including exanthe- ma, lymphadenopathy, conjunctival injection, and changes to the mucosae and extremities. Although the etiology remains unknown, the current consensus is thatit is likely caused by an (infectious) trigger initiating an abnormal immune response in genetically predisposed children. Treatment consists of high dose intravenousimmunoglobulin (IVIG) and i s directed at preventing the development of CAA. Unfortunately, 10 -20% of all patients fail to respond to IVIG and these childrenneed additional anti-inflammatory treatment. Coronaryartery lesions are diagnosed by echocardiography inthe acute and subacute phases. Both absolute arterial diameters and z-scores, adjusted for height and weight, are used as criteria for CA A. Close monitoring of CAA is important as ischemic symptoms or myocardial in- farction due to thrombosis or stenosis can occur. Thesecomplications are most likely to arise in the largest, so- called giant CAA. Apart from the presence of CAA, it is unclear whether KD causes an increased cardiovascu-lar risk due to the vasculitis itself. Conclusion : Many aspects of KD remain unknown, although there is growing knowledge on the etiology, This Review refers to the article http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00431-017- 2943-7 .

Since children with previous KD are entering adulthood, long-term follow-up is increasingly important. What is known: \u0081Kawasaki disease (KD) is a pediatric vasculitis with coronary artery damage as its main complication . \u0081Although KD approaches its 50th birthday since its first description, many aspects of the disease remain poorly understood . What is new: \u0081In recent years, multiple genetic candidate pathways involved in KD have been identified, with recently promising information about the ITPKC pathway . \u0081As increasing numbers of KD patients are reaching adulthood, increasing information is available about the long-term consequencesof coronary artery damage and broader cardiovascular risk .

This condition, now known as BKawasaki disease (KD), ^is in- creasingly recognized in Western countries but has a greatlyincreased incidence in Japan and Asia. The main complicationis coronary artery damage or coronary artery aneurysms (CAA) and KD is the leading cause of pediatric acquired heart disease in asset-rich countries. Epidemiology Kawasaki disease is commonest in infants and young chil-dren. The incidence varies markedly between ethnic groups.The incidence of KD in recent European studies is 5 -10 per 100,000 children under the age of 5 years [ 45,55,105,120]. A considerably higher incidence is reported in Asian countries[14,44]. The highest incidence is found in Japan; the most recent nationwide survey reported an incidence of 265/100,000 children under the age of 5 in 2012, and suggestedthat the incidence of KD is still rising [ 78]. Most patients are 6 months to 5 years old, although cases in older children andadults also occur [ 36]. The male/female ratio is approximately 1.5 to 1 [ 120]. Diagnosis The diagnosis of KD is based on the presence of clinicalfeatures of persistent fever in combination with a polymor- phous exanthema, cervical lymphadenopathy, non-purulent conjunctival injection, changes of the lips and oral cavity (in-cluding strawberry tongue, cracked lips, redness of the muco- sae), and changes in extremities (swelling and redness of the palms, desquamation in the subacute phase) [ 83]. In the most recent American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines, persis- tent fever is classified as 5 days, but in the presence of four or more symptoms, the diagnosis can be made with only 4 days of fever [ 83,99].BComplete ^KD is defined as fever and 4 out of the 5 symptoms. It is important to appreciate that criteriamay present successively instead of simultaneously. The AHA has created an algorithm to increase the possibility of Bincomplete ^KD in case 3 criteria are present. This algo- rithm includes CA abnormalities on echocardiography and/or laboratory abnormalities [ 83]. There is no diagnostic test for KD, and the diagnosis may be delayed or overlooked. To im- prove diagnosis, multiple new biomarkers have been studied, but none has so far proved specific for KD [ 96]. Classification tools have been developed to aid in the differentiation between KD and other febrile illness, although the utility as a point-of- care diagnostic test remains unproven [ 46,74]. Etiopathogenesis Although the etiology of KD is unknown, the current consen-sus is that it is likely caused by an (infectious) trigger initiating an abnormal immune response in genetically predisposed996 Eur J Pediatr (2017) 176:995 -1009children. An infectious suspected due to the symp- tomatology of KD resembling common childhood infections, once-in-a-lifetime occurrence at young age (although secondmanifestations do occur), spatial and temporal clustering, and the clear seasonal pattern in high-incidence countries [ 57,78]. Infectious agents Multiple viral infectious triggers have been suggested, includ- ing coxsackie virus, parainfluenzavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, chikungunya, and cytomeg- alovirus. In fact, two recent studies showed that up to abouthalf of all KD patients had one of more respiratory viruses detected by PCR, but their etiological role is unproven [ 13, 128]. Also, the possibility of a respiratory RNAvirus has been suggested by ultrastructural studies of autopsy specimens[102,103]. However, no virus has repeatedly been confirmed in KD studies. Bacteria have also been suggested as the trigger of KD, with research mainly focusing on bacterial superantigens. Superantigens produced by several bacteria are able to stimu-late a large percentage of T cells by binding to the V region of T cell receptors and so stimulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. One study looking at fivesuperantigens (streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin (SPE)-A, C, G, and J, and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1)), found these in 70% of stool samples collected from acute KD pa-tients as opposed to 27% in healthy controls visiting the same center for vaccinations [ 117]. Another study found significant- ly increased IgM antibodies against five superantigens (staph- ylococcal enterotoxin A, B, and C, TSST-1, and [ 80]. Nevertheless, the role of superantigens in KD remains unclear. Immunological response The encounter of a susceptible individual with the unknown agent probably leads to an (exaggerated) immune response involving innate and adaptive pathways. Multiple studies have been performed, both evaluating animal models and immuneresponse in the peripheral blood as well as immune infiltration in the coronary arteries [ 52,131]. The general paradigm of the immune response is an imbal- ance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory path- ways. For example, regulatory T cells, a subset of T cellslimiting inflammation, have been shown to be important in the vascular inflammation [ 37]. Also, the IL-1 signaling path- way is upregulated, with upregulated IL-1 pathway genes and increased IL-1 concentrations in peripheral blood of KD pa- tients during the acute phase [ 50,119]. Recently, it has be- come clear that inflammasomes, multiproteins that are part of the innate immune system, are induced by the NLRP3 gene and promote the production of IL-1 and IL-18, play a role in KD [ 2].In the coronary arteries, immune infiltration of wall neutrophils, CD8+ cytotoxic accompa-nied by pro-inflammatory cytokines which may vary in pro- portion and contribution over time [ 6]. Genetics Genetics are considered to contribute to susceptibility to KD,a n dp r o b a b l yt oC A Aa n dr e s p o n s et ot r e a t m e n t[ 91,132]. A number of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed [ 7,63,69,72,92,94,126]. Apart from the GWAS, multiple studies have identified specific single nucle-otide polymorphisms (SNPs) in several genes. Most of thesecandidate genes have an immune regulatory function. Table 1 shows some of the key pathways and SNPs associated withKD susceptibility, CAA development, and intravenous immu-noglobulin (IVIG) resistance. In the first GWAS that resulted in a significant correlation with susceptibility to KD, we identified the major activatingIgG receptor FcgRIIa (CD32a) on immune cells and platelets, encoded by the FCGR2A gene at the FCGR2/3 gene cluster at chromosome 1q23 [ 7]. Following this study, Japanese and Taiwanese studies also confirmed this genetic associationwhile at the same time characterizing CD40 andBLK,r e s p e c - tively, as being associated with KD, as confirmed for BLK in Caucasian KD patients in a subsequent meta-analysis [ 12,72, 94].CD40 is a protein expressed on antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells, and interacts with CD40L which is primarily expressed by activated T cells and platelets [ 49]. The function of FA M1 67 A andBLK gene is yet to be investigated. The BLK gene encodes for tyrosine kinase, which is presumed to play a role in B cell signal trans-duction [ 100]. From alternative genetic studies (non-GWAS), other path- ways were found to be involved, such as vascular endothelialgrowth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin anti-inflammatory signals in contrast to ANGPT2 and TIE-2, which have a pro-inflammatory effect with VEGF act- ing as a co-factor. Also the transcription growth factor beta(TGF- ) pathway may play an important role. TGF- is im- portant in T cell activation and cardiovascular remodeling.One of the more recent and promising pathways of a transmembrane signaling pathway with re- lease of Ca 2+from intracellular storage [ 48]. Initially, nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) was suggested to be in-volved in regulating the immune response in KD. The NFATpathway is calcium-dependent, and when these cytosolic become dephosphorylated, they translocate from the cy- toplasm to the nucleus of downstreamEur J Pediatr (2017) 176:995 -1009 997Table 1 Candidate genes and pathways associat ed with disease susceptibility, CAA development, and IVIG resistance Candidate pathway Ethnicity Reference Included cases/controls Susceptibility to KD (gene)Susceptibility to CAA (gene)Susceptibilityto IVIGresistance (gene) European descent (case-control), Australia, NL, USA, UK (family based)Khor et al.

This would make ITPKC responsible for a greater and more prolonged expan- sion of inflammation, thus creating an increased risk of KD and/or leading to disease severity [ 76]. Alphonse et al. sug- gested that the role of ITPKC is not T cell-mediated but moremonocyte/macrophage-dependent in its impact [ 2]. They showed that ITPKC influences NLRP3 activation through in- tracellular calcium levels leading to an increased IL-1 and IL-18 production. Khor et al. performed a global meta- analysis of SNP rs28493229 in ITPKC of all performed stud- ies, including GWAS data, showing evidence pathways and candidate genes have, sometimes in- consistently, been implicated including ATP-binding cassette,subfamily C, member 4 ( ABCC4 ), interleukin-4, interleukin- 10 and interleukin-18, chemokine receptors, tumor necrosis Fig. 1 The role of IP3 and ITPKC in calcium signaling.

NLRP3 is an inflammasome that forms at or close to the MAM upon cellular activation and ER stressand plays a pivotal role (by activating caspase-1) in the cleavage of pro-IL1b into IL1b and its subsequent secretion. The ER releases calcium intothe cytosol and into mitochondria through (a.o.) the IP3R, which is a calcium channel, to which IP3 as an agonist binds to induce calcium release. IP3R binds via glucose-regulated protein 75 ( GRP75 )w i 1 ( VDAC1 which mitochondrial stress and leakage off reactive oxygen species(ROS), both important for inflammasome activation.

The main goal of treatment is preven- tion of the development of CAA. Hypothesis on the mecha- nisms of efficacy of IVIG include immune modulation of T regulatory cells, neutralization of the etiologic agent, and re- duction of cytokine production [ 8]. Treatment with IVIG sig- nificantly reduces incidence of CAA [ 124]. IVIG is pref- erably given within the first 10 days after disease onset [ 83]. Apart from IVIG, high-dose aspirin is advised by the AHA,although evidence for further risk reduction for CAA is lack- ing [34,124]. Adjunctive use of treatment The majority of patients respond rapidly to IVIG, yet approx- imately 10 -20% of all patients do not respond or have recur- rent fever within 36 -48 h after IVIG. These children have a higher risk of developing CAA [ 53]. In Japan, risk-scores have been developed to identify patients with a higher risk of IVIG resistance [ 35,66,106]. Unfortunately, these risk- scores do not perform adequately in Western, ethnically mixed, and in Chinese populations [ 24,75,104,112,115]. A possible method to decrease IVIG resistance is to intensifythe initial treatment. A recent meta-analysis showed a benefi-cial effect of adding corticosteroids to the initial treatment with IVIG, yet this effect was only found in Japanese studies and not in two studies conducted in the USA [ 16]. Burns et al. showed that adding infliximab to initial IVIG treatment did not decrease treatment resistance but did decrease the number of days with fever and inflammation parameters 24 h aftertreatment [ 125]. Rescue treatment following IVIG non-response Children who do not respond to IVIG require additional anti- inflammatory treatment. A second dose of IVIG is commonlyadvised, particularly in patients who have partially responded. Furthermore, corticosteroids are still commonly advised. The above-mentioned meta-analyses showed no significant benefit for either of these approaches when used as rescue treatment [16]. In 2012, we published the first case report successfully using the IL-1 antagonist anakinra for refractory KD [ 22]. Since then, additional clinical trials have been instigated toinvestigate both efficacy and safety of this IL-1 inhibitor [ 9]. Other secondary treatment cyclosporine (calcineurin inhibitor), and statins, yetefficacy remains to be investigated [ 10].Additional treatment After normalization of temperature, the AHA advises ongoing aspirin in a low dose until no evidence of CA dilation are present at by 4 to 6 weeks after the acute illness [ 83]. If CAA are present and persisting around that time, aspirin is continued as anti-thrombotic therapy. In case of large (around az-score 10) or complex abnormalities, additional anticoagulation therapy should be administered to prevent clotting due to turbulence in these pro-coagulatory large cor- onary artery lesions [ 83,87]. Coronary artery aneurysms Multiple criteria have been used for diagnosis of CAA. Thecriteria of the Japanese Circulation Society (JSC) state that an aneurysm is an artery of >3 mm in a child under the age of 5and an artery of >4 mm in a child 5 years or when an arterial segment is 1.5 times its adjacent segment [ 31]. A giant CAA is classified as 8 mm or >4 times its adjacent segment [ 42]. Conversely, over the past years, it has become clear that z- scores, diameters adjusted for basal-surface-area, may be bet-ter indication of abnormality [ 25]. classifica- tions exist [ 23,79,82,90]. Unfortunately, the z-scores using different classifications can vary, mainly at larger dimensions[101]. The threshold for abnormality is a z-score 2.5, al- though a z-score between 2 and 2.5 can be classified as a dilation [ 83]. A small-sized CAA has a z-score of 2.5 -5, a medium-sized CAA of 5 -10, and a giant CAA of 10 [79]. Risk factors for CAA have been inconsistently reported but include a male gender, a young age (<1 year), an incompletedisease presentation, IVIG resistance, and the duration of fe-ver [43,64,113,114]. Imaging of CAA Multiple imaging techniques exist for the follow-up of pa- tients after KD and in particular children with CAA.Echocardiography is a non-invasive method to image the cor- onary arteries, used in the acute phase of KD as well as during follow-up. With this non-invasive method, it is possible toevaluate the anatomy of the coronary arteries, myocardial function, and valve abnormalities. Nevertheless, it is impossi- ble to visualize the distal coronary arteries with echocardiog- raphy. The gold standard for coronary anatomy is a conven- tional angiography, though this technique is invasive and ex-poses the patient to radiation. The role of cardiac MRI (cMRI) has been established over the past years [ 81,122]. Using this modality, evaluation of the anatomy as well as cardiac func- tion is possible. The disadvantage of cMRI is the need for anesthesia in younger children. CT angiography is an alterna- tive. (2017) of radiation exposure, the new low-radiation dose CT scanning machines are becoming more widely available, which decreases the radiation burden significantly showinggood resolution capacity in a small study [ 33]. In Fig. 2,a MRI and CT image of a normal and a giant CAA are depicted.The AHA and JCS have both published guidelines on the follow-up of patients after KD [ 42,83]. Recently, we pro- posed a pathway to follow-up patients after KD based on theworst-ever z-score [ 28]. This pathway includes a cMRI (with or without adenosine stress testing according to the CAA sta-tus) during adolescence for all patients to visualize the com-plete coronary tree and a more intensive follow-up for patients with CAA (Fig. 3). Natural history of CAA Many CAA regress to a normal-sized lumen, mainly within the first 5 years. The likelihood of regression seems to be highly dependent on the original CAA size [ 19,38]. While the lumen diameter may return to normal, it has become ap- parent that the vascular wall is often still damaged. Studies have shown persistent impaired dilation upon increased cardi-ac demand [ 39]. Also, changes in the coronary artery wall structure are seen, such as intimal hyperplasia [ 30,54]. The remodeling of the coronary wall can cause potentially life-threatening situations as was shown by a case series of three adult patients who were released from follow-up care after normalization of the lumen but presented with chronic heartfailure, unstable angina, and acute myocardial infarction [ 41]. Consequences of CAA (Giant) CAA may have serious long-term consequences. Apart from thrombosis within the CAA and perfusion abnor-malities after the CAA, there is an increased risk of stenosis just proximal or distal to the CAA [ 59]. In a large study of 245 Japanese patients with giant CAA (8 mm), Tsuda et al. found 10-, 20-, and 30-year event-free survival rates of 64, 48, and 36%, respectively [ 127]. Fifteen patients died during follow-up. In another study of 76 Asian patients with giant CAA ( 8 mm), 10-, 20-, and 30-year sur- vival rates of 95, 88, and 88% were reported [ 116]. In a recent study by Friedman et al., 21 major adverse cardiac events(MACE) took place in 90 patients with giant CAA at diagno- sis (z-score 10) [38]. This indicates that patients with giant CAA are at considerable risk for MACE and risk continues toexist years after the acute phase of KD. The risk for patients with small-medium-sized CAA is less clear. In a study by Chih et al., only 1/51 patients withmedium-sized CAA (>4 -8 mm) experienced ischemia during a median follow-up time of 47 months, although an additional 8 patients had stenosis and 4 patients developed calcification [19]. No patients with small-sized (localized dilatation with 4 mm diameter) CAA experienced MI. In the study by Friedman et al., no patients with small- ( z-score 2.5 -5) or medium-sized CAA (z-score 5 -10) experienced any MACE. However, longer term studies will be needed to establish the Fig. 2 Imaging techniques used for Kawasaki disease. a,b,d,edisplay coronaries of the same patient with different imaging techniques. a Curved multi-planar reformat of the coronary computed tomography an- giography (cCTA) scan shows an aneurysm of the right coronary artery. b A giant aneurysm of the left anterior descending artery. cA normal left anterior descending artery. dThin slab maximum intensity projection of the aneurysmatic proximal right coronary artery and left anterior descend-ing artery. eA clearly depicted giant aneurysm of the left anterior de- 1003long-term event rate in patients with small- or medium-sized CAA. In patients with persisting CAA, calcifications are likely to develop as shown by a recent study looking at CT calciumscoring [ 56]. The data suggested this only occurs from ap- proximately 10 years onwards following KD. If thrombosis, stenosis, or abnormal blood flow in the CAA leads to a cardiac event or signs of ischemia, KD patients may need cardiac intervention. Thrombolytic treatment has been reported to be effective in treating fresh thrombus within giantCAA and in emergency management of ischemia due to thrombus [ 47]. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary ar- tery bypass grafting (CABG) can be used to revascularize theartery when stenotic lesions are present. CABG is used more often in multi-vessel disease. Percutaneous transluminal an-gioplasty may be complicated by the need of high balloon pressures in patients who have already developed calcification [1]. Two studies evaluating the difference between these two methods found that reinterventions were significantly higher in the PCI group [ 29,84]. Available data are scarce on risk during pregnancy for women after KD. In a case series including 10 women whodelivered 21 babies, none of the women experienced cardio- vascular complications during pregnancy, including 4 womenwith CAA, MI, and CABG in the past [ 40]. In a following comprehensive review, 56 women with 81 deliveries weredescribed and cardiovascular complications were reported in 7 cases, including 2 MIs during pregnancy [ 40]. Longer term studies will be needed to define the long term risk of CAA. However, the significant proportion of patientsdeveloping thrombosis within giant CAA, or suffering ische- mic events due to stenosis, suggests that all patients with sig- nificant aneurysms following KD need life time follow-up and are at risk of cardiac complications long term. General cardiovascular risk Apart from the increased cardiovascular risk due to persisting or regressed CAA, it is uncertain whether the vasculitis itself causes an increased cardiovascular or atherosclerotic risk at a later age. As most patients have not been followed long enough to evaluate the long-term natural course of the disease,multiple studies have focused on the use of surrogate markers for cardiovascular disease such as flow-mediated dilation, stiffness index, and carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT)[17,89,107]. Two reviews showed that most of these studies are small, lacking quality and there was significantly hetero-geneity between studies [ 15,27]. Nevertheless, results Fig. 3 Flow diagram of the monitoring of Kawasaki disease using different imaging modalities.

In a follow-up study evaluating cIMT, we found that patients with giantCAA have a trend towards an increased cIMT at a later age, whereas in children without any coronary artery enlargement, their cIMT was initially increased but normalized to controlvalues over time [ 26]. The results suggest that long-term ef- fects of KD are not caused by atherosclerosis, as one wouldexpect the differences in cIMT to increase compared withcontrol measurements. This is in concordance with a postmor- tem study in which multiple growth factors were seen in the smooth muscle cells and intima layer of the coronary arteries,but no atherosclerosis [ 118]. Quality of life and behavior Multiple studies have investigated the cognitive and behavior- al outcome after KD. Baker et al. studied 110 KD children,and found similar psychosocial and physical summary scores as an US population sample using a parent-completed ques- tionnaire [ 3]. Only patients with giant CAA had a lower mean physical score. Parents did however report lower health per- ception. King et al. studied 38 KD patients and found no effect on cognitive or academic performance, but parents rated theirchildren as having more internalizing and attentional behavior problems than controls [ 65]. Carlton-Conway et al. found that 40% of their patients showed internalizing scores in the clin- ical range as reported by parents, which was significantly more than their hospital controls who stayed in the hospital for a short period and had undergone cardiac catheterization[11]. Nishad et al. found no difference in social adaption, cognitive function, and behavioral function in 20 children[88]. Muta et al. studied 250 adolescents and young adults, including 19 patients with giant CAA and found significantly higher health-related quality of life (HRQOL) scores com- pared to national norms [ 85]. Two studies from our center showed significantly lower scores on several HRQOL scales in children under 5, when reported by their parents. However, self-report by the older KD children did not show any signif-icant difference with controls. Moreover, parental perceptions of child vulnerability were significantly increased when com- pared to reference groups of Dutch parents [ 121,129]. Conclusion Although many aspects of KD are still unknown, there isincreasing knowledge on the origin and treatment of KD as well as the development and classification of CAA. Since children with previous KD are entering adulthood, long-termfollow-up, with appropriate imaging modalities and aware- ness of the long-term effects, is increasingly important.
