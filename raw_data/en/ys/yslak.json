These natural products are especially appealing from a medicinal standpoint as they are already known to be safe for human consumption. [4](#B4-nrp-14-453)]. The water-soluble polysaccharide fraction (LLP-1A) from Lilium lancifolium has also been shown to induce macrophage activation through the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B) signaling pathway [ [5](#B5-nrp-14-453)]. NF-B is a transcription factor that regulates various physiological processes, including immune responses and cell survival [ [6](#B6-nrp-14-453)]. Activated NF-B by natural product extracts enters the nucleus to induce the expression of NO and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as [9](#B9-nrp-14-453) mechanism of these responses by AMPK in macrophages is unclear, it is recently reported that AMPK regulates multiple downstream targets such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) activity [ [10](#B10-nrp-14-453)]. Suppression of AMPK, using a dominant negative construct or RNA interference, increases NF-B signaling [ [9](#B9-nrp-14-453) [11](#B11-nrp-14-453)], whereas activation of AMPK using an [12](#B12-nrp-14-453)] and antibacterial [ [13](#B13-nrp-14-453)] activities, improvement of liver function [ [14](#B14-nrp-14-453)], and enhancement of cognitive ability [ [15](#B15-nrp-14-453)]. In particular, platycodin D and platycodin D3 as main active ingredients of PG have anti-inflammatory activities, as it was shown to mitigate the inflammatory response induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in RAW 264.7 (a macrophage cell line) cells [ [16](#B16-nrp-14-453)]. Moreover, PGPStc, a polysaccharide derived from PG, stimulates the proliferation of spleen lymphocytes and promotes cell cycle progression of T cells [ [17](#B17-nrp-14-453)], suggesting that PG may have immunomodulatory effects. [18](#B18-nrp-14-453)]. However, the underlying immune-enhancing mechanisms of FPGE in macrophage cells are largely unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture and reagents Preparation of the extract from FPGE [18](#B18-nrp-14-453)]. The main active ingredient of FPGE was platycodin D, which was 4 times higher content than in PG extract. Cell viability assay NO measurement RNA isolation and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) Luciferase h transfection, were incubated with LPS (1 g/mL) or FPGE (0, 20, 100, or 500 g/mL). After incubation for 24 h, the media was replaced with luciferase assay solution (Nano-Glo\u00ae Dual-Luciferase\u00ae Reporter Assay System) following the manufacturer's instructions. The luciferase activity was measured using a GloMax\u00ae Discover Multimode Microplate Reader (Promega). Western blot analysis RESULTS FPGE induces cell proliferation in RAW 264.7 cells [Fig. 1](#F1-nrp-14-453)). FPGE enhances NO production in RAW 264.7 cells [20](#B20-nrp-14-453)]. To examine the effect of FPGE on NO production in macrophages, we measured nitrite (NO2) level using the Griess Reagent System. Previously, we have shown that LPS induces NO production 18 to 24 h after treatment in RAW 264.7 cells [ [21](#B21-nrp-14-453) [22](#B22-nrp-14-453)]. In this study, we also confirmed the induction of NO production by LPS in the macrophage. After treating RAW 264.7 cells with FPGE for 24 h, we observed a slight but statistically significant enhancement in the production of NO at the highest concentration (500 g/mL) of FPGE ( [Fig. 2](#F2-nrp-14-453)). in RAW 264.7 cells [8](#B8-nrp-14-453)]. For example, after treatment with LPS as a positive control, we observed increased messenger RNA expression of Tnf-, IL-1b, and IL-6 ( [Fig. 3](#F3-nrp-14-453)). To assess whether were similarly activated by FPGE, we treated RAW 264.7 cells with various concentrations of FPGE and measured messenger RNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines using real-time RT-PCR. Compared to LPS treatment, the effect of FPGE on cytokine levels was less pronounced, but statistically significant compared with the vehicle control at high concentrations ( [Fig. 3](#F3-nrp-14-453)). FPGE induces NF-B activation in RAW 264.7 cells [11](#B11-nrp-14-453)], we observed increased NF-B promoter activity by LPS in RAW 264.7 cells, transfected with appropriate reporter constructs. The treatment with FPGE at 500 \u00b5g/mL also showed the induction of luciferase activity ( [Fig. 4A](#F4-nrp-14-453)). To further confirm the effect of FPGE on NF-B activation, we assessed the phosphorylation status of multiple components in the NF-B pathway by western blot. As a positive control, LPS increased the levels of pNF-B and IB ( [Fig. 4B](#F4-nrp-14-453)); under the same conditions, phosphorylation levels of NF-B were increased by FPGE in a dose dependent manner. Phosphorylation levels of IB were slightly increased at the highest concentration (500 g/mL) of FPGE. Therefore, these results demonstrate that FPGE can activate macrophages by NF-B signaling. FPGE-induced NF-B activation associated with AMPK in RAW 264.7 cells [Fig. 5A-C](#F5-nrp-14-453)). There was no significant difference in phosphorylation levels of AMPK or ACC after FPGE treatment in RAW 264.7 cells, although the ratios of phosphorylated to total AMPK and ACC tended to decrease ( [Fig. 5A-C](#F5-nrp-14-453)). To further examine the effect of AMPK on NF-B signaling, which remains poorly understood, we performed NF-B reporter gene analysis after treatment with a known AMPK inhibitor (compound C) or an activator (AICAR) in addition to our standard LPS or FPGE treatment. We found that the NF-B reporter activity increased after treatment with compound C, and decreased after treatment with AICAR. Furthermore, AICAR significantly suppressed the NF-B activity elevated by LPS and FPGE ( [Fig. 5D](#F5-nrp-14-453)). These results suggest that AMPK inhibition associated with the NF-B transcriptional activation induced by FPGE treatment. DISCUSSION [18](#B18-nrp-14-453)]. The immune-related effects of platycodin D have been reported to have anti-inflammatory and immunoadjuvant activity [ [16](#B16-nrp-14-453) [23](#B23-nrp-14-453)]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate immune-enhancing effects of FPGE in a macrophage cell. We demonstrated that FPGE induced macrophage cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Unlike LPS-induced macrophage proliferation, which accompanies morphological change (i.e. stretching-out shape like dendritic cells) [ [4](#B4-nrp-14-453)], FPGE appears to increase the number of cells without morphological change. [24](#B24-nrp-14-453)]. Our real-time RT-PCR results revealed that FPGE also modulates the expression of these pro-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, we confirmed that FPGE could act as an immunostimulant. [25](#B25-nrp-14-453) [26](#B26-nrp-14-453) [28](#B28-nrp-14-453)]. These indicate that natural product could be effective immune modulators, although the mechanisms are not clearly understood. In this study, we showed that FPGE activates NF-B signaling, which may be an important underlying mechanism of FPGE-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Although NF-B enhances immunity, it also causes inflammation [ [6](#B6-nrp-14-453)]. To investigate the effect of FPGE in severe conditions such as LPS-induced inflammation, we co-treated macrophage cells with FPGE and LPS. We observed that markedly suppressed NF-B luciferase activity ( [Supplementary Fig. 1](#S1-nrp-14-453)) induced by LPS, supporting previous research that FPGE has anti-inflammatory effects [ [18](#B18-nrp-14-453)]. [14](#B14-nrp-14-453)] and adipocytes [ [29](#B29-nrp-14-453)], as well as in mouse models [ [30](#B30-nrp-14-453)]. However, in our experimental system, FPGE showed a tendency to reduce the signaling of AMPK in RAW 264.7 cells. These observations suggest that cellular response to FPGE treatment may be cell type-dependent. [Fig. 5D](#F5-nrp-14-453)). Therefore, these data suggest that FPGE can be a promising immune-enhancing agent stimulating NF-B signaling. "}
