You've likely heard horror stories from friends and relatives who have undergone surgical treatment for their arthritic condition, only to come out of surgery equally in pain... or even worse-off. Arthritis is chronic inflammation. People experience different types of arthritis, and each case is caused by a different root health problem. Regardless of the type of arthritis our Virginia Beach patience experience, ChiroSolutions Center works to identify a treatment option, helping manage arthritis pain and inflammation. Get to know your arthritis Some types of arthritis, like rheumatoid arthritis, are an auto-immune response impacting the entire body. The more common osteoarthritis is inflammation impacting certain areas of the body, caused by joint strain or friction. Osteoarthritis symptoms usually occur in the hips, back or hands. Most types of arthritis are caused by irreversible medical conditions. Your top priority should be finding treatment to slow the progression of the disease. The right treatment plan can help you live your life as fully as possible. It's also smart to look into minerals, vitamins, and compounds that alleviate inflammation. These things, coupled with targeted chiropractic care and manual manipulation, make it possible to control arthritis symptoms naturally, without surgical intervention. Supplements for control As the body ages, it stops producing many of the compounds, hormones and chemicals necessary to regulate inflammation. This is why many people begin to experience arthritis symptoms as they age. There are, thankfully, supplements to replace these lost compounds, including the following: - Omega-3 fatty acids: Omega-3 fatty acids have broad benefits, including inflammation control. Omega-3s are usually found in high concentrations in fish oils, as well as vegan alternatives, like flax seeds. - Glucosamine: This substance helps keep cartilage flexible and well-hydrated. Natural glucosamine levels decrease with age, so finding a supplementary replacement is important. - Vitamin D: Vitamin D is known to reduce joint pain and improve sleep quality. If you're suffering from arthritis, a daily vitamin D pill could be tremendously helpful. - Green tea: Green tea-based supplements are known for their anti-inflammatory properties. They're also anti-oxidant, meaning they can help stave off potential cancer growth. Sticking to a diet rich in these compounds or supplementing a healthy diet is often recommended for arthritis patients. Proper nutrition provides a sound basis for any adjustments and exercises performed over time. Chiropractic care for arthritis control A key benefit of chiropractic care is inflammation alleviation. Depending on the placement and severity of your pain, a chiropractor may recommend full-body sessions, or focus on adjusting highly targeted areas. Some chiropractors may also offer physical therapy, designed to help you regain your range of motion. Nutrition counseling can also help patients cut inflammation-causing foods out of their diets.
