Health fraud scams waste money and can lead to delays in getting proper diagnosis and treatment. They can also cause serious or even fatal injuries. The U.S. FDA issued letters to these companies for illegally marketing products for the treatment or prevention of serious diseases. Thirty days after FDA issued these letters, the companies listed have failed to voluntarily cease illegally marketing products for serious diseases. The U.S. FDA sent abuse complaints to registrars managing websites that offer any unapproved drugs or uncleared devices, or potentially counterfeit, controlled, adulterated or misbranded products to U.S. consumers in violation of U.S. law. This list only includes a small fraction of the potentially hazardous products with hidden ingredients marketed to consumers on the internet and in retail establishments. FDA is unable to test and identify all products marketed as dietary supplements on the market that have potentially harmful hidden ingredients. "}
