Pour your troubles into a personal journal. Move your body for self-awareness. Or paint your way out of depression. All these remedies are part of a church-sponsored program called The Creative Health Arts Connection, Friday through Sunday at Unity Christ Church. The free event brings artists and musicians together with Reiki practitioners and acupuncturists to teach about alternative healing methods. To kick off the weekend, singer and storyteller Ella Hill will host Drumming for the Turtles, a fund-raising event for The Karen Beasley Sea Turtle Rescue and Rehabilitation Center in Topsail Island at 6:30 p.m. Friday at the church. Attendees will drum and sing the night away with Hill, who \"guides earth-centered healing ceremonies that promote self-healing, harmony and balance.\" The night will include sessions on sacred space prayer work with Linda White and Annie Miller. \"When you renew your environment, it just allows more balancing of body, mind and spirit,\" said Eileen Argenbright, an artist and organizer of the program. \"Unity Christ has so many great healers in the congregation, we decided to combine all the arts together just to help people find out more about the health arts.\" The main workshops are 10 a.m.-4 p.m. Saturday at the church. Courses include: Introduction to Medical Intuition, Collage Magic, Master Herbalism and Electromagnetic Field Balancing Techniques. "}
