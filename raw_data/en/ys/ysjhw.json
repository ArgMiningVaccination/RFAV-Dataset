It's a strategy that looks at all of your health needs -- physical and emotional -- and comes up with a tailored plan that treats your [cancer](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/) and manages symptoms and side effects, too. You'll get advice on how to use complementary therapies in addition to standard treatments, not in place of them. Your plan might include things like an [exercise](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/default.htm) routine, traditional Chinese medicine, [massage](https://www.webmd.com/balance/massage-therapy-styles-and-health-benefits), or meditation. The goal is to soothe your spirit along with healing your body. Acupuncture In this traditional Chinese medicine, a practitioner puts fine needles into specific points on your body. You can find independent professionals, though [acupuncture](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/consider-acupuncture) is now offered at a growing number of major cancer centers around the country. Many people with cancer say it helps relieve [nausea](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-nausea-vomiting), [pain](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/default.htm), [anxiety](https://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/default.htm), [insomnia](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/insomnia-symptoms-and-causes), and lack of appetite. Mind-Body Therapy If you're feeling stressed, anxious, depressed, or having [trouble sleeping](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/default.htm), a mind-body therapy may help. You can try different types of meditation, including quiet contemplation or meditative walking. You can also do [tai chi](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/video/tai-chi-health-benefits), which combines meditation with Chinese martial arts. [Yoga](https://www.webmd.com/balance/the-health-benefits-of-yoga), which tends to combine meditation and a focus on [breathing](https://www.webmd.com/lung/how-we-breathe) with specific postures, is also a popular option. Massage Massage may help you [manage pain](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/guide/pain-management-living-managing) and muscle tension. It can also relieve [stress](https://www.webmd.com/balance/stress-management/default.htm) so you feel better and have less [anxiety](https://www.webmd.com/balance/stress-management/rm-quiz-stress-anxiety). If possible, look for a trained oncology massage therapist. Ask if your hospital has one on site. Reflexology Reflexology is another hands-on therapy that focuses on your hands, [feet](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/guide/foot-pain-causes-and-treatments), and [ears](https://www.webmd.com/picture-of-the-ear). A trained therapist puts pressure on specific points, sometimes with the help of rubber balls, rubber bands, and pieces of wood to help you relax, relieve pain, and increase your circulation. Aromatherapy Some people with cancer find that the fragrance from [essential oils](https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/ss/slideshow-essential-oils) from certain plants helps them feel more relaxed or eases nausea. A therapist can also massage the oils into your body. Talk to your doctor before trying essential oils and discuss how you plan to use them. Dietary Supplements Some people with lymphoma try a variety of [vitamins](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/lifestyle-guide-11/default.htm) and herbs, such as multivitamins, [vitamin D](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/video/vtamin-d-and-your-health), [green tea](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/features/health-benefits-of-green-tea), and [flaxseed](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/supplement-guide-flaxseed-oil). Keep some things in mind about this. [Dietary supplements](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins-and-supplements/supplement-faq), like medicine, can have risks and side effects. But the FDA doesn't regulate them as strictly as [drugs](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/index-drugs.aspx), so they don't get the same careful testing of how well they work or whether they're safe to use. Also, you can't always be sure that the supplements you buy contain exactly what's on the label. Researchers found that some supplements had ingredients that weren't listed or contained different amounts than described. Talk to your doctor before you try any vitamins, minerals, and herbal supplements. They can tell you whether they might interfere with other medicine you take. Exercise Research shows that people with lymphoma who get regular [exercise](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/ss/slideshow-7-most-effective-exercises) are happier, healthier, and less [tired](https://www.webmd.com/women/why-so-tired-10-causes-fatigue) than those who aren't active. Some physical activities you might try are walking, [swimming](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/default.htm), or [strength training](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/default.htm). Before you start an exercise routine, check with your doctor to find out if there are certain activities you should avoid. They may suggest you meet with a physical therapist, who can set up an exercise plan that's tailored to your needs. Nutrition Counseling Your [cancer treatment](https://www.webmd.com/cancer/understanding-cancer-treatment) may curb your appetite and sap your energy. Choosing the right foods can help you feel better, stronger, and more energetic. Ask your doctor if [nutrition](https://www.webmd.com/diet/default.htm) counseling is available at your cancer center. If not, they can refer you to a dietitian who has experience working with lymphoma patients. "}
