In In In In SS SStudy I tudy I tudy I tudy I, we have investigated the regulatory role of a class of non0 coding RNAs, the miRNAs, during thymocyte developme nt of the where central tolerance is established. W e used the non0obese diabetic mouse (NOD) which is spontaneous ly developing T1D and have been described to have d efects in the T cell maturation. By studying the apoptosis re sponse of NOD lymphocytes (which activates similar cell0cycle checkpoints and apoptosis pathways as during thymoc yte maturation) we showed differential expression o f the miRNA0 34a/b/c gene family, miR0125 and miR0155 in the DNA damage response between NOD and wild0type mice. We believe that these differentially expressed miRNAs may cont ribute to defect p53 expression in NOD thymocytes a fter DNA damage, which we also demonstrated in this study. I n In In In SS SStudy II tudy II tudy II tudy II, we studied the importance of global canoni cal miRNA regulation in the NOD mice for the development of T 1D development by deleting Dicer1 (an enzyme needed for miRNA maturation) early in thymocyte development. We show ed that these NOD.Lck0Cre Dicer1/ mice had phenotype alterations including markedly decreased amount of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in the secondary lymph nodes but not a similarly large decrease in nTregs. No difference in diabetes incidence between female NOD.Lck0Cre Dicer1/ mice and control littermates could be found as a result of these phenotypic changes but surprisingly a sign ificant increase in the male mice diabetes incidence. In In In In SS SStudy III tudy III tudy III tudy III, we investigated whether the maternal inte stinal microbiota is an environmental factor influencing T1D development in the offspring. By modulating the intestinal gut mi crobiota with antibiotics during pregnancy of NOD mice we showed decreased diversity and a persistent modulation of the intestinal microbial pattern in the offspring.

The innate immune system includes cell types like monocytes/macrophages (M ) which are the first to arrive to an inflammatory site and initiate an unspecific immune response. For instance, M recognize pathogen0associated molecular patterns (P AMPs) via Toll0like receptors (TLRs) and initiates an inflammatory response with secretion of pro0inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Takeda et al. 2003). The effect of inflammatory cytokines results in physiological changes, such as increased blood flow to facilitate the transportation of more inflammatory cells to the in flammatory site. The subsequent rise in body temperature as the result of cytokine production is one of the preventative measures to inhibit the replication of invading mic roorganisms. In addition, released chemokines attract more effector cells to the site of inflammation. The innate immune response is the first line of defense of the immune system. Owing to the innate immune response the body is given more time to raise a sec ondary and more specific line of defense called the adaptive immune response(Janeway et al. 2001). Here, the main effector cells are the T cells and the B cells whic h are the producers of specific antibodies against pathogenic antigens. These adaptive immune cells act together with the antigen0 presenting cells (APCs) the dendritic cells (DCs), which have migrated to the site of inflammation. The migration allows the DCs to encou nter pathogens and process into peptides. Once achieved, the DCs further migrate to the secondary lymphoid organs from the site of inflammation to present the antige ns to na\u00efve T cells (Guermonprez et al. 2002). The na\u00efve T cell recognition of the anti gen and activation leads to 18 proliferation of the T cells and differentiation in to different effector T cell populations with different functions that are able to eliminate the pathogens during the adaptive immune response. The immune system is very effective in eliminating pathogens but mechanisms to clear the immune responses in order to maintain immunolog ical balance (tolerance) is however one the most important features of the immu ne system. Similarly, tolerance is an essential feature of the gut immune system. With the high presence of 10 11 intestinal bacteria per gram intestinal content of the colon, bacterial antigens that would normally induce an immune response are tolerated and do not induce immune reaction. This is an evolutionary symbiosis between intestinal bacter ia and the host. Moreover, the commensal intestinal bacteria are not only passive bystanders, but can actively interact with the immune system to protect the body from pat hogenic bacteria (Belkaid and Tarbell 2009). However, in genetically susceptible individuals, the breakdown of tolerance in the gut leads to inflammatory bowel di seases like ulcerative colitis (UC). On the other hand, breakdown of immunological toler ance in the pancreatic islets leads to the autoimmune disease type 1 diabetes (T1D). T T T T cells cells cells cells The T cells are divided into the two different type s, the T cells and T cells. The T cells have a more restricted antigen recognition than T cells and respond more rapidly than the T cells. For this reason, the T cells are often referred to as \"innate0like\" T cells. The T cells, in contrast to the T cells, are able to recognize antigens without the need of pre0processing and pre sentation of pathogenic antigens by the APCs (Schild et al. 1994). Both the T and T cells play a role T1D development in the main mouse model for human T1D c alled the non0obese diabetic 19 (NOD) mice the (Markle et al. 2013). This is closer described in the future section \"Non0obese diabetic mouse (NOD)\". However, the role of T cells in NOD mice is complicated because they have also been shown to al so have a protective function against T1D when isolated from the intestinal intra epithelial lymphocyte (IEL) populations (Locke et al. 2006). The involvement of T cell lineage in the gut immune system is closer described in the section \"G ut immune system\". The T cells are the most common cells in the immune sy stem. These cells are divided into CD4 + and CD8 + T cells based on their co0receptors. CD4 + T cells interact with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) cla ss II and differentiate into T helper cells (Th1 or Th2) upon activation. The diff erentiation into Th1 or Th2 cells depends on the types of cytokine present in milieu during activation (Constant and Bottomly 1997). Th1 cells are induced by interferon (IFN)0 and interleukin (IL)012 and their differentiation is regulated by the key t ranscription factor Signal transducer and activators of transcription (STAT)04, which in its turn is regulating T0bet (Murphy et al. 2000). Differentiated Th1 cells secrete IL02 and the pro0inflammatory cytokine IFN0 , which is involved in activation of monocytes during inflammatory response and is involved in the pathology of T1D in pancreatic i slets (El0Sheikh et al. 1999). This is further described in the \"Pathogenesis of T1D\" sect ion. Cytokine milieus with IL04 differentiates na\u00efve T c ells into Th2 cells. This transformation process is mediated by the key trans cription factors STAT06 and GATA03 which results in such as IL04, IL013 and IL010 (Murphy et al. 2000). Th2 cytokines promotes B cell differentiation and antibody production against specific pathogenic antigens. Ho wever, both Th1 and Th2 cells can participate in antibody responses. For example IL04 promotes class0switch to IgE in response to parasites and IFN0 can mediate class0switch to IgG2a against viral infections (Vinuesa et al. 2005). 20 In a state of tolerance breakdown the Th1 cells hav e been shown to be involved in pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases like type 1 dia betes (T1D), Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) etc. (Peluso et al. 2006; Larsen et al. 2012; Oreja0Guevara et al. 2012). In contrast, Th2 cells are involved in pathogenesis of for instance UC, allergic disease, systemic lupu s erythematosus (SLE) (Funauchi et al. 1998; Georas et al. 2005; Heller et al. 2005). There is another class of T cells, the Th17 cells. Na\u00efve T cells are differentiated into Th17 cells in the presence of IL023 and IL06. Howev er, the participation of transforming growth factor (TGF)0 and IL021 have also been demonstrated in the induction of Th17 cells (Korn et al. 2009). The pro cess of differentiation in this case is mainly under transcriptional regulation by STAT0 3 and matured Th17 cells are able to produce the cytokine IL017. The dual role of Th1 7 cells in the intestine is described in the section \"Gut immune system\". Notably, the in volvement of Th17 cells in the pathogenesis of T1D has been confirmed in animal mo dels and has also been found to be increased as circulating cells in patients (Shao et al. 2012). The mechanisms by which Th17 cells are believed to mediate T1D develo pment involves the suppression of regulatory T cells (Tregs) expansion, mediates T cell shift to CD8 cytotoxic (Shao et al . 2012). Tregs are necessary to keep the immunological balan ce to \"self\" and they are Natural CD3 +CD4 +CD25 + Tregs (nTregs) are derived from thymic differentiation and express the master regulator tr anscription factor Forkhead box p3 (Foxp3). However, Tregs can also be induced in the periphery and are then referred as iTregs. Moreover, as not all iTregs express Foxp3, cells lacking Foxp3 expression are further sub0divided into Tr1 and Th3 cells which ar e characterized by their ability to secrete IL010 and/or TGF0 (Curotto de Lafaille and Lafaille 2009). The mecha nisms through which Tregs can suppress and regulate T cel l responses as well as innate 21 immune responses are described in more detail in th e \"Tolerance versus autoimmunity\" section. One of the main functions of the CD8 + T cell is the recognition of virus infected cells and abnormal cells such as cancer cells (Klenerman and Hill 2005; Gattinoni et al. 2012). The recognition is mediated through the inte raction with MHC class I, which is expressed on nearly all cells in the body. Na\u00efve CD8 + T cells mature into cytotoxic T cells that have the ability to induce cellular apop tosis by releasing lytic granules containing perforins. These enzymes create pores in the lipid bilayer of the target cell and subsequently release proteases referred as gran zymes. Also, CD8 + T cells could employ perforin0independent mechanism of cytotoxici ty that involves binding of membrane incorporated Fas ligand (FasL) to Fas on t he target cell. Both the release of perforin/granzymes and the Fas0FasL interaction ind uce the intrinsic apoptotic pathway by cleaving and activating pro0caspases (Ru ssell and Ley 2002). T T T T cell development cell development cell development cell development All immune cells develop from hematopoietic stem ce lls and a common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) has been suggested for T and B cells (Kondo et al. 1997; Wada et al. 2008). The differentiation of T c ells occurs while the thymocytes are migrating through the cortical and m edullary regions of the thymus (Figure 1). During migration through the cor tex the thymocytes are characterized into different developmental stages b ased on their expression of extracellular and intracellular markers. The early maturation stages are defined mainly by the expression of KIT (CD117) and CD24 an d (DN4). At the DN3 stage, T cells differentiate int o either T cells or T cells (Taghon et al. 2006). 22 During the DN3 stage the pre0T cell receptor (pre0T CR) 0chain is rearranged with V(D)J recombination by joining the invariant D and J chain segments with the variable V chain. The recombination maximizes t he T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire and increases the probability of antigen recognition. This process is called \" 0selection\", in which the rearranged 0chain is combined with the invariant 0chain in the pre0TCR. The early pre0TCR is then te sted for the ability to interact with the MHC molecule presented by the cortical thymic epithelial cells (cTECs) (Hoffman et al. 1996; Dudl ey et al. 2005). DN3 cells express T cell specific genes like the Recombinatio n activation genes 1 and 2 (Rag1 and Rag2) which encode for endonucleases that are active during the V(D)J recombination of the TCR chain as well as genes for CD3 and Lck molecules (David0Fung et al. 2006). Collectively, t hese molecules are part of the T cell receptor which plays a critical role in the process of positive thymocyte selection. If the V(D)J recombination of the and chains is unsuccessful and TCR signaling fails, the thymocyte is eliminated by apoptosis that might involve p53. The involvement of p53 in the apoptosis of thy mocytes during development is described further in the next sectio n. Successful recombination, on the other hand, results in proper TCR signaling that mediates transition of the DN cells into the next maturation step (Jiang e t al. 1996; Haks et al. 1999). Before the thymocytes fully gain CD4 +CD8 + double positive (DP) expression, they undergo an intermediate stage of differentiati on called immature0single positive (ISP) and transiently express CD4 0CD8 lo (Paterson and Williams 1987; Rothenberg and Taghon 2005). The commitment to the CD4 + or CD8 + lineage has been shown to be influenced by the Lck activity strength in the interaction with the MHC complex. High Lck activity gives stron ger interaction with MHC, thus stronger TCR signal which mediates the di fferentiation into CD4 + 23 T cells whereas lower Lck activity will give rise t o CD8 + T cells (Hernandez0 Hoyos et al. 2000). After passing positive selection, DP thymocytes mig rate towards the medullary parts of the thymus. The migration of the DP thymoc ytes is directed by chemokines as for instance CCR7, binding to recepto rs expressed on medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) (Takahama 2006; Nit ta et al. 2008). In the medulla, thymocytes that interact with high0affinit y to self0derived peptides are usually deleted by apoptosis in a process defined a s the negative selection (Sebzda et al. 1999). Self0antigens are presented by the mT ECs and dendritic cells in the medulla where they can provide the right co0stimula tion by expression of the B7.2 (CD86) w hich for optimal negative selection (Page et al. 1993; Nitta et al. 2008). Finally, the na\u00efve CD4 + or CD8 + single0positive T cells migrate into the periphery . Ultimately, only ~1% of thymocytes survive the maturation and m igrate into the periphery (Berzins et al. 1999). 24 Figure 1. Figure 1. Figure 1. Figure 1. T cell maturation in the thymus. As the thymocytes migrate through t he thymic cortex they go through early DN10DN4 maturation sta ges characterized mainly by the sequential expression of CD25 and CD44. The re0arra ngement to DN4 stage. Upon succes sful re0arrangement of the and 0 chains, the TCR is tested for the ability to recogn ize the MHC0peptide complex presented by the cTECs in a process defined as positive selectio n. At this developmental stage the thymocyte is double positive and express both CD4 + and CD8 + co0receptor molecules. As the DP thymocytes pass positive selection and migrate t owards the medullary regions of the thymus they commit to either CD4 + or CD8 + T cell lineage. In the medullary regions the thymocytes go through the process of negative selec tion where they are eliminated by apoptosis if the affinity to self0antigens presente d by the mTECs/DCs is too high. Only ~1% of the thymocytes pass both positive and negative s election and can migrate into the periphery as mature na\u00efve T cells. 25 Cell cycle checkpoint and a Cell cycle checkpoint and a Cell cycle checkpoint and a Cell cycle checkpoint and apoptosis poptosis poptosis poptosis during thymocyte selection during thymocyte selection thymocyte selection during thymocyte selection The TCR chain re0arrangement involves V(D)J recombi nation and is tightly linked with the non0homologous end joining (NHEJ) m achinery. The NHEJ machinery is ligating the double strand breaks (DSB ) during the recombination to avoid abnormal joining and chromosomal transloca tions (Lieber 2010). Following the V(D)J recombination in the 0selection, the cell cycle is arrested at a checkpoint to minimize the chance of prolifera tion in case of abnormal V(D)J recombination (Lin and Desiderio 1995). A rol e for the tumor suppressor protein p53 is suggested in the regulation of this cell cycle progression and apoptosis (Figure 2) (Guidos et al. 1996; Jiang et al. 1996; Haks et al. 1999; Costello et al. 2000). In contrast, it has also bee n shown that V(D)J recombination in vivo does not induce p53 expression in wild0type mice a nd that p53 0/0 mice have normal T cell development (Donehower et al. 1992; Guidos et al. 1996). In addition, Haks et al. showed that cell cycle arrest can be overcome. In CD3 0/0 mice the thymocytes can proceed with maturation ev en in the absence of functional pre0TCR receptor signalin g (Haks et al. 1999). On the other hand, the cell cycle checkpoint seem to invol ve p53 activation in the immunodeficient SCID mice (Guidos et al. 1996). SCI D mice have previously been shown to lack functional TCR and B cell recept ors (Bosma and Carroll 1991). More recently, Haines et al. demonstrated that blocking of lymphocyte development at the cell cycle checkpoints where RAG activity is present could provoke lymphogenesis in a genetic background of mi ce with deficient DNA damage response (Haines et al. 2006). Additionally, p53 was shown to be involved in apopt osis induction during negative selection (Figure 2) (Quaglino and Ronchet ti 2001). Also, Zhu et al. demonstrated the involvement of E2F1 regulation of ARF and p53 in the 26 negative selection of thymocytes (Zhu et al. 1999). However, thymocyte apoptosis during negative selection have also been shown to involve the mechanism of Fas0FasL interaction (Kishimoto et al. 1998). Also, Fas independent mechanism of apoptosis of semi0mature t hymocytes has been shown involving Bim (Bouillet et al. 2002; Villunge r et al. 2004). Figure Figure Figure Figure 22 22.. .. Illustration of the proposed cell cycle progressi on and G1 checkpoint during 0selection respectively negative selection in thymo cyte development involving p53. Depending on different signaling involving p53 this can lead to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of the thymocyte. 27 Nevertheless, changes in p53 levels can be involved in determining the outcome of apoptotic signals during specific stages of thym ic development which can influence the susceptibility of thymocytes to apopt osis. In Study I, we tried to elucidate the control mechanism of p530dependent DN A damage response in the presence of DNA strand breaks after V(D)J recom bination as well as during negative selection in non0obese diabetic (NOD) mice . T cell activation T cell activation T cell activation T cell activation The T cells scan for antigens that are presented by the DCs in the lymph nodes, matching to their TCR specificity. When a fitting a ntigen is presented to the T cell an immunological synapse (IS) or contact is fo rmed between the T cell and the APC. This mechanism is responsible for activati on of T cells. The IS is divided into the central supramolecular activation cluster (cSMAC) and peripheral supramolecular activation cluster antigen 4 (CTLA04) (Figure 3 ) (Chen and Flies 2013). In this cluster, the CTLA04 molecule is a negative regulator of T cell activation and is up0regulated upon T cell activation and lead s to reduced T cell proliferation by inhibition of IL02 transcription a nd subsequent cell cycle arrest cyclin D3 and cyclin dependen t kinases Moreover, the pSMAC includes other co0stimul atory molecules such as CD2 with APCs LFA01 that interacts with ICAM01 on the APC (C hen and Flies 2013). T cell activation engages the phosphorylation of immu noreceptor tyrosine0based activation motifs Fyn and CD4/CD8 a consequence, the t yrosine kinase ZAP070 is 28 activated and in turn is phosphorylating several ad aptor proteins including linker for activation of cells (LAT). The adaptor proteins mediate activation of phospholipase C (PLC)0 that generates diacylglycerol (DAG) se Engaged PKC through various signaling pathways ultimately gener ates elevated cytosolic Ca 2+ influx and activation of transcription of transcrip tion factors including NF0 B, NF0AT and 2001; Srikanth and Gwac k 2013; Gerondakis et al. 2014). These transcription factors in turn indu ce different effector molecules that cause T cell differentiation with effector fun ctions as well as IL02 production necessary for T cell proliferation and expansion. 29 Figure Figure Figure Figure 33 33.. .. The TCR interaction with an appropriate MHC0pepti de complex leads to T cell activation initiated by formation o f the immunological synapse (IS) which is a contact area between the T cell and the APC. At the stage of T cell activation the TCR0associated CD3 chains is ph osphorylated by the tyrosine kinase Lck. CD28 interaction with B7.1 or 2 provide s a necessary co0stimulatory signal. ZAP070 becomes activated by phosphorylation that leads to recruitment of the adaptor protein LAT. LAT then induces a down stream signaling cascade that ultimately activates the nuclear transcription factors NF0 B, NF0AT olerance tolerance is established by eliminating pot entially self0reactive T cells that TCR binds to with high affinity to self0antigens during thymocyte development. However, all potentially auto0reactive T cells are not delet ed because all self0antigens are not present in the thymus. Therefore, mechanisms exists in the periphery to maintain peripheral tolerance. This include induction of T c ell anergy, T cell deletion and T cell suppression. Tregs are responsible for the suppress ion of self0reactive T cells by several mechanisms. For example, anergy is characterized by the total lack of T cell response and can be induced by the absence of co0stimulation from B7 family molecules on the 30 APC cell at T cell activation and by CTLA04 up0regu lation (Rudd et al. 2009). Tregs have been shown to suppress T cell responses by ind ucing down0regulation of co0 stimulatory molecules and IL02 production by direct cell0cell mediated interaction (Cederbom et al. 2000; Vendetti et al. 2000). CTLA04 which is constituently expressed on Tregs may be also involv ed in suppression of T cell function (Read et al. 2000; Takahashi et al. 2000). For inst ance, Tregs have described to suppress tryptophan catabolism DCs in CTLA04 med iated fashion and direct cell0 cell interaction with B7 family molecules (Fallarin o 2003). DCs, has been shown to be involved in suppression of antigen0driven proliferation of T cells (Munn et al. 2004). Altern atively, CTLA04 could also directly give a negative proliferation signal of T cell resp onses through interaction with the B7 family molecules (Paust et al. 2004). Direct T cell deletion is achieved through Fas0FasL interaction which initiates intrinsic apoptosis program of the cell including downstream caspase cascade activation (Russell and Ley 2002). Similarly, Tregs could potentially b e used to induce apoptosis of effector T cells by using FasL. For instance, Tregs primed with FasL administrated to mice with chronic colitis, were shown to severely r educe the pathogenic burden of the animals (Kaminitz et al. 2013). Tregs have also been shown to suppress both T cell responses and innate immune cells through secretion of IL010 and TGF0 . The anti0inflammatory functions of activation and reduction of cytokine secretion from effector T cells and additionally inhibiting antigen0induced proliferation by down0regulation of co0stimulatory molecules on APCs R oberts 1998; Moore et al. et al. 2003). The IL010 and TGF0 immunosuppressive mechanisms are 31 particularly crucial for maintaining intestinal tol erance and inhibiting development of intestinal inflammation (Asseman et al. 1999). Furt her description of this subject is outlined in the \"Gut immune system\" section. Defects in the mechanisms responsible for maintenan ce of central and peripheral tolerance, as described above, leads to breakdown o f tolerance which results in autoimmune diseases like T1D and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Autoimmune diabetes (type 1 diabetes) Autoimmune diabetes, also known as T1D is character ized by insulin deficiency due to 0cell destruction caused by immune cells infiltrati ng the pancreatic islets. The loss of 0cell mass results in elimination of insulin produc tion and consequently impaired uptake of glucose to the cells which give rise to s ystemic hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis. As the result of failure of insulin p roduction, T1D leads to a lifelong insulin dependency. Until 1920's T1D was untreatabl e and a therefore considered as a fatal disease. The scientists Frederick Banting, Ch arles Best and John Macleod changed the paradigm by successfully treating a diabetic do g with pancreatic extract from a healthy dog. They also managed to treat the first h uman, a boy dying from diabetes, by injecting a more refined extract of insulin (Bantin g et al. 1922; King and Rubin 2003). A better understanding of the disease causing mecha nism of came with the discovery of autoantibodies in 1974 which suggested that T1D was an autoimmune disease (Bottazzo et al. 1974). To date, the major autoanti bodies against 0cell antigens target insulin (IAA), glutamic carboxylase acid 65 (GADA), insulinoma0associated protein 2 (IA02A) and Zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8A) (Atkinson et al. 2014). The triggers that initiate the autoimmune attack on the 0cells by the T cells and other mononuclear cells to date remains elusive. However, it is believed that potentially 32 autoreactive T cells that escaped clonal deletion a re activated by DCs presenting 0cell antigens which they encounter in pancreatic islets during very early insulitis. Alternatively, T cells may be activated by 0cell antigens that are released after a virus infection from damaged 0cells as a result of the inflammatory response. Epidemiologically, the highest prevalence of T1D is observed particularly in Finland, but also in the other Scandinavian countries and Sa rdinia, whereas the disease prevalence is less frequent in Asia, Southern Europ e and Middle East (Tuomilehto 2013). Although, there is a strong genetic basis of the disease, the incidence of T1D is increasing globally with approximately 2.8 % each y ear (Group 2006). Thus, triggering environmental factors in addition to genetic factor s are important for the initiation of T1D. Patho Patho Patho Pathogenesis genesis of T1D of T1D Histological similarities but also differences of T 1D have been observed between humans and mice. For example, diabetogenic CD8 + T cells, CD4 + T cells, monocytes and B cells have been observed in pancreatic islets of humans and mice during insulitis (Wong et al. 1999; Willcox et al. 2009). However, p eri0islet insulitis and the massive infiltration of pancreatic islets in NOD mice have in contrast not been found in humans in which insulitis has only been observed in <10 % of islets (In't Veld 2014). Animal studies show that the inflammatory process i n the pancreatic islets during early insulitis is driven by diabetogenic T cells and mon onuclear cells. Diabetogenic T cells primarily induce 0cell death through the Fas0dependent mechanism, as described earlier. In addition, T effector cells secrete IFN0 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF0 ) et and 1999; Calderon et al. 2008). Thes e cytokines are 33 responsible for both maturation and activation of i mmune cells and attraction of more immune cells to the pancreatic islets (Bergholdt et al. 2004; Cantor and Haskins and Wilson 2007; in th e 0cells induce cell death (Eizirik and Mandrup0 Poulsen 2001; Gurzov et al. response secreted IL01 and TNF0 , activation of the NF0 pathway results in the expression of genes of several chemo kines and inducible nitric Quintana0Lopez Moreover, 0cell exposure to TNF0 and IFN0 induce apoptosis through the activation of the transcripti on factor STAT01 and pro0apoptotic protein Bim (Barthson et al. 2011). In short, the 0cell inflammatory response is actively involved in the pathogenesis of T1D and ultimately resulting in the loss of 0cell mass. The decrease in 0cell mass due to 0cell death in turn causes insulin deficiency and c hronic hyperglycemia. Genetics of T1D Genetics of T1D Genetics of T1D Genetics of T1D The strongest genetic association with T1D suscepti bility is found in the human leukocyte gene (HLA) class II and in NOD the mouse analogue I0Ag7 , which encodes the MHC II molecule. In humans the HLA genes accoun t for approximately 40050 % of the T1D risk (Noble and Valdes 2011). The HLA cl ass II gene is situated on chromosome 6p21 locus and has several susceptibilit y regions. The DR30DQ2 and DR40DQ8 regions confer the highest T1D risk and are present in 90 % of Caucasian T1D patients (Kockum et al. 1999; Devendra et al. 2 004). Also, genetic variation in non0HLA genetic suscepti bility genes is associated with human T1D. For instance, the variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) upstream of 34 the insulin gene (INS) which are located on chromos ome 11p15.5 is a known genetic susceptibility region (Undlien et al. 1995). The PT PN22 gene is a second non0HLA susceptibility gene for T1D (Smyth et al. 2004). PT PN22 gene is located on chromosome 1p13 and is encoding the lymphoid tyrosi ne phosphatase LYP that is involved in down0regulation of T cell activation. A lso, the CTLA04 gene (located on chromosome 2q33) has also been associated to T1D (N istico et al. 1996). In addition, in the NOD mouse CTLA04 is suggested to be one of t he candidate susceptibility genes (located in Idd5 on chromosome 1). Moreover, CTLA040/0 mouse lymphocytes are similarly to NOD lymphocytes resistant to 0irradiation induced apoptosis (Bergman et al. 2001). Apoptosis resistance of NOD lymphocyt es is further described in the section \"Non0obese diabetic mouse (NOD)\". Environmental factors in T1D and inflammation Although the genetic factors are established to be the strongest contributor to increased T1D risk, it is not clear how the disease is initia ted. Environmental factors that have been considered in triggering T1D include for insta nce virus infections by enteroviruses, cytomegaloviruses, rotaviruses and h erpesviruses. Viruses with the strongest association to T1D risk are enteroviruses . The probability of finding enteroviruses is 10 times higher in T1D patients th an in healthy individuals (Yeung et al. 2011). The presence of Coxackie virus B1 has be en associated with two or more autoantibiodies found in the serum of children that were progressing towards T1D (Lonnrot et al. 2000; Laitinen et al. 2014). Recent ly, Ferreira et al. and Kallionp\u00e4\u00e4 et al. reported an increased innate IFN0 expression pattern that are associated with virus infections in children with genetic predisposition prior to progression to T1D (Ferreira et al. 2014; Kallionpaa et al. 2014). Although, vir us infections notably seem to trigger 35 0cell autoimmunity in some T1D susceptible individu als, only a low percentage develop the disease considering the high frequency of virus infections. Other environmental factors which could influence t he development of T1D are infant and maternal diet as well as intestinal microbiota (Vaarala 2004; Norris 2010; Vaarala 2013). For instance, hydrolyzed casein in the diet increased plasma insulin concentration and insulin content in islets as well as reduce L0glutamine oxidation in both islets and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) resul ting in decreased diabetes incidence in diabetes prone BB rats (BBdp) (Malaiss e et al. 2000; Scott et al. 2000). A certain type of wheat protein diet has on the other hand been shown to accelerate diabetes incidence in BBdp rats (Chakir et al. 2005 ). In children with genetic risk for T1D, a recent association study could not show any difference in risk to develop 0cell autoimmunity after use of hydrolyzed casein formula and autoantibodies (Knip et al. 2014). Another dietary factor that is associated wi th increased risk of T1D in humans is low intake of vitamin D (Littorin et al. 2006). In NOD mice the administration of oral vitamin D has been shown to protect NOD mice f rom T1D. More specifically, the intake of 50 ng of vitamin D per day prevented the onset of T1D through 200 days of age (Zella et al. 2003). Supplementation of vita min D in humans was observed to benefit T1D patients with vitamin D deficiency and intake of vitamin D combined with calcium resulted in improved glycemic control (Aljabri et al. 2010). In short, the dietary effects of vitamin D seem to benefit both N OD mouse and human with T1D. Dietary components have the ability to modulate the gut microbiota. The connection of the intestinal microbiota to development of auto immune disease as well as inflammatory bowel disease is addressed in the next couple of sections. 36 Commensal g Commensal and con sists of anaerobic, aerobic and facultative aerobic bacteria with increasing propor tion of anaerobic bacteria in the distal areas of the intestine. The dominating phyla in the colon are the Firmicutes (including genera of Clostridium, Enterococcus, Lactobacillus and Lactococcus ) mainly Bacteroides species (Hold et al. 2002; Eckburg et al. 2005). T he minorities (approximately 10 %) of the colonic 2005; Eckburg et al. 2005). Although there are variations of bacterial strains in different in dividuals and also between family members, the overall phylotypes are conserved (Turn baugh et al. 2009), which suggests similar metabolic function. The symbiosis between t he gut microbiota and the host gives the benefit of maximizing extraction of dieta ry energy by fermentation of dietary carbohydrates, vitamin synthesis (K, B12, biotin, f olic acid) and amino acid synthesis (Hooper et al. 2002). Another advantage of the gut microbiota is their ability to act as a protective barrier against pathogenic bacteria wh ich is further described in the \"Gut immune system\" section. In addition, the gut microb iota is necessary for proper development of the immune system, demonstrated by t he fact that mice kept in germ0 free (GF) conditions have underdeveloped gut0associ ated immune tissues, lower amount of CD8 + intraepithelial T cells with impaired function and fewer plasma cells (Round and Mazmanian 2009). This indicates that the maternal gut microbiota is important for development of the fetal immune syste m as well as early priming against commensal microbes. Previously it has been shown that already after 48h after birth the gastro0intestinal tract of a child is colonized with strains , Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides fragilis, Enterococcus Enterobacteriaceae (Karlsson et al. 2011). The maternal, gut microbiota, vaginal flora and skin are important so urces but also hospital environment 37 can be a bacterial source (Mackie et al. 1999; Favi er et al. 2002; Fanaro et al. 2003). Recently, evidence points out that transplacental t ransmission of the microbiota of mothers starts already during pregnancy (Satokari e t al. 2009) and also postnatally with the mothers' milk in both humans (Martin et al. 200 3) and mice (Zhou et al. 2000). There are even new evidence that the placenta itsel f harbors microbiota similar to the mother's oral microbial pattern (Aagaard et al. 201 4). Therefore in Study III, we investigated whether derangement of the maternal gu t microbiota during pregnancy could impact on the development of the offspring's gut microbial pattern, gut immune system and impact the incidence of autoimmune diabe tes. Gut microbiota and T1D Gut microbiota microbiota and T1D Gut microbiota and T1D In the state of disease the gut microbial pattern i s often altered compared to healthy individuals. For example, it has been observed that children progressing towards T1D had decreased proportion of Firmicutes which was ac companied by an increase in Bacteroidetes phyla (Giongo et al. 2011). Other Bacteroides , Clostridium and Veillonella genera were more abundant in children with 0cell autoimmunity with lower abundance of the Bifidobacterium , Lactobacillus and Prevotella genera's compared to healthy children (de Goffau et al. 2013 ; Murri et al. 2013). In the NOD mouse, it has been shown that the gut microbiota has the potential to modulate diabetes development (King and Sarvetni ck 2011; Kriegel et al. 2011). In the same line, NOD mice bred in germ0free condition s displayed higher incidence of T1D or increased insulitis compared to specific pat hogen0free (SPF) conditions (Pozzilli et al. 1993; Alam et al. 2011; Tlaskalova 0Hogenova et al. 2011). In addition, modulation of the gut microbiota by the use of anti biotics has been shown to alter diabetes incidence in both NOD mice (Wen et al. 200 8; King and Sarvetnick 2011; 38 Kriegel et al. 2011) and BB rat models of type 1 di abetes (Brugman et al. 2006; Roesch et al. 2009). TT TThe g he g he g he gut immune system ut immune system ut immune system ut immune system The intestines are among the largest areas of conta ct of the body to external antigens (both dietary and potential pathogens) and not surp risingly the largest amount of immune cells can be found in the gut0associated lym phoid tissues (GALT), (Figure 4.) The GALT mainly consists of the Peyer's patches, ML N (that drain the intestines more distally), isolated lymphoid follicles and the lymp hocyte populations in the connective tissue of the intestine, the lamina propria (LP) (I zcue et al. 2009). The Peyer's patches have the anatomical structure of a lymph node with B cell and T cell areas and the development of the Peyer's patches in intestine is not dependent on the gut microbiota (Mowat 2003). In contrast, the number of isolated l ymphoid follicles could be triggered by intestinal microbiota and the number of follicle s increases during chronic inflammation (Lorenz et al. 2003). The gut microbiota is actively involved in the gut0 immune responses to maintain the immunological balance in the GI tract. The commensa l gut microbiota can actively defend the intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) agains t pathogenic bacteria by inducing the secretion of antimicrobial peptides like 0defensins and lysozyme from a type of epithelial cells, the Paneth cells (Ayabe et al. 20 00). Another type of epithelial cells, the Goblet cells, secrete mucin with high quantities of glycosylated proteins that forms a gel0like mucus layer on the epithelial surface that limits the contact with the intestinal bacteria (Hansson and Johansson 2010). 39 Figure 4. The figure shows the intestinal architecture and t he gut0associated lymphoid tissues (GALT), the Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph no des (MLN). The monolayer of several intestinal epithelial cells connected with tight ju nctions form the architecture of the villi and crypts. The Goblet cells secrete mucus that covers the epithelial cell layer to limit the contact with the bacteria in the lumen. The Paneth cells se crete antimicrobial peptides which adds to another line of defense to the intestinal barrier t ogether with the IgA antibodies secreted from differentiated B cells, the plasma cells. Peyer's p atches (located to the left in the illustration) ha ve distinct B cell and T cell areas and specialized ty pe of cells towards the lumen called microfold (M) cells. The M cells have the ability to catch an d transmit soluble antigens and bacteria to the Peyer's patch where they can either be processed by dendritic cells or ingested by macrophages (M ). DC, M and intraepithelial T cells (IEL) populations are also present within the epithelial cell layer and in the lamina propria (LP), situated between the epithelium and the deeper submucosa. The DC have the ability to stretch betwe en the tight junctions of the epithelial cells and collect soluble antigens directly from the lume n. Innate immune responses to limit intestinal barrier penetration by bacteria can be a MyD880dependent TLR activation that leads to the pr oduction of antimicrobial peptides (Vaishnava et al. 2008). Moreover, TLR2 si gnaling has also shown to enhance tight junctions between the IEC and contribute to a n even more restricted environment 40 against bacterial penetration (Gibson et al. 2008). Another mechanism by which commensal bacteria, particularly SFB, limit bacteri al expansion is through the induction of IgA via the adaptive immune response. (Suzuki et al. 2004). Secreted IgA could be involved in trapping the bacteria in the m ucus layer (Fagarasan and Honjo 2003). SFB in LP and small intestine have also been demonstrated to induce the expansion of Th17 cells leading to protection again st Citerobacter rodentium infection (Ivanov et al. 2009). In addition, the recruited Th 17 cells from secondary lymphoid organs to Peyer's patches have recently shown to al so be involved in induction of IgA response (Hirota et al. 2013). However, Th17 cells are also involved in the chronic inflammation and development of IBD in the colon by mediating recruitment of neutrophils (Honda and Takeda 2009). Also, Th17 dif ferentiation could further the disease progression by inhibiting Treg differentiat ion (Izcue et al. 2008). Thus, the Th17 cells in the gut environment is complex and de monstrated to have a dual role in disease protection and amplification. With respect to the symbiosis of commensal bacteria , there is a mechanism to mediate T cell tolerance towards commensal gut microbiota a nd in the intestine. This mechanism is controlled by Foxp3 + Tregs or IL010/TGF0 producing iTreg cells. The production of IL010 prevents the activation of M that inhibits the recruitment of T effector cells to the intestine (Asseman et al. 199 9; Powrie 2004). In addition, intraepithelial T cells have been demonstrated to induce and mainta in oral tolerance by secretion of IL010 (Kapp et al. 2004; Yue et al. 2013). Breakdown of tolerance in the intestines causes intestinal inflammation becau se the immune system overreacts to commensal bacterial antigens in genetically suscept ible individuals or fail to down0 regulate immune response. Inflammation reduces inte stinal mucus layer which allows for more contact of the bacteria to the intestinal epithelial cells and increases interaction 41 with the immune system. Chronic intestinal inflamma tion ultimately manifests in ulcerative colitis (UC), an inflammatory bowel dise ase. Ulcerative Colitis (UC) Ulcerative Colitis (UC) Ulcerative Colitis (UC) Ulcerative Colitis (UC) Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are two majo r forms of IBD. The clinical symptoms include diarrhea, rectal bleeding, weight loss and abdominal pain (Podolsky 2002). The development of UC is influenced by multi ple factors including genetic susceptibility and environmental factors like intes tinal microbiota and the relationship of the gut microbiota and the immune system. Geneti c susceptibility regions associated with UC are IL-10 and ARPC2 regulatory pathways as well as the known T1D susceptibility regions HLA/MHC and PTPN2 and PTPN22 (Kaser et al. 2010). Although it is not known whether altered gut microb iota is a causative factor of UC, it has been shown that the intestinal microbiota in mu cosa of UC patients contains a high of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis and Cl ostridium difficile while strains Lactobacillus decrease during active colitis (Fabia et al. 1993; Wang et al. 2007). Colitis in animal models can be pathogen induced ( Citrobacter rodentium ), genetically induced through IL-10 deletion or alternatively chemically induced with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) (Kaser et al. 2010). The DSS in vivo model has widely been used since the 1990's because when administered orally i t can both induce acute and chronic colitis in rodents and because that the histopathol ogical characteristics are similar to human UC (Okayasu et al. 1990). The mechanism by wh ich DSS induces colitis is to the present day elusive. However, recent studies sh ow that DSS can form nanovesicles with medium0chain0length0fatty acids (MCFA) which c an fuse with colonocyte membrane. Delivery of the DSS into the epithelial c ells can negatively affect the function and activate inflammatory signaling pathwa ys which ultimately leads to 42 increased intestinal permeability (Laroui et al. 20 12). Interestingly, MFCAs are present at high concentrations in the colonic lumen (Schmid t et al. 2011) and salts of the MFCAs capric and lauric acids have been shown to in crease rectal drug absorption, probably due the effects on the intestinal tight ju nction barrier function (Laroui et al. 2012). Increased colonic mucosal permeability also allows increased translocation of bacteria and endotoxin from the lumen which can bot h induce inflammatory reaction and impinge on the function of the epithelial cells (Kitajima et al. 1999). Increased TLR recognition as the result of translocation of b acteria and endotoxins mediates increased cytokine production monocytes that fur ther amplifies the inflammatory process (Cario 2005). Thus, chemical initiation of inflammation by DSS could trigger and exaggerate the biological events of inflammatio n. The cells present in the ulcerative lesions in the intestinal mucosa during acute inflammation include lymphocytes, mast cells, M and neutrophils (Fiocchi 1997). In children with UC, an increase of Th017 cells is obs erved in the colonic mucosa together with increased cytokines IL06 IL022 and IL017 (Holtta et al. 2013). Interestingly, H\u00f6ltt\u00e4\u00e4 et al. reported an increase in the number Foxp3 + Tregs and this finding is further discussed in Study IV. Previously, it was believed that the Th02 cells were the main mediators of UC. However, at present it is well0known that Th017 cells and the cytokines they secrete are also crucially involved in UC to initiate and enhance the inflammatory process (lvez 2014). T he inflammatory M are well0 known contributors to inflammation in IBDs. Another type of mediator in IBD are mast cells. In DSS0induced mouse model these cells release Mast cell protease 6, a tryptase that acts upstream of many factors implica ted in IBD. The production of the enzyme after DSS treatment enhances pro0inflammator y cytokines and chemokines that specifically attract neutrophils and other ext racellular matrix remodeling enzymes that partake in the DSS0mediated loss of epithelial cells. Thus, mast cells and their 43 production of tryptase are also important inflammat ory instigator of IBD (Hamilton et al. 2011). microRNAs MicroRNAs (miRNAs) belong to class of small endog enously expressed non0coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and were first identified in 1993 by Lee et al. and Wightman et al.. They identified previously unknown RNA element regu lating the developmental timing of C. elegans , the lin04 and lin014 (Lee et al. 1993; Wightman e t al. 1993). In 1998, RNA interference (RNAi) was described by Fire et al. as the mechanism by which miRNAs regulate target mRNAs (Fire et al. 1998). Af ter the discovery of the first miRNAs, in years 200002003, a set of papers was the big kick0off for the miRNA field showing that many miRNAs were not only expressed in C. elegans but in fact in all mammals and were very evolutionary conserved betwee n species (Pasquinelli et al. 2000; Lagos0Quintana et 2001; Lee and Ambros 2001; Lagos0 Quintana et al. 2003). Today, there are around ~200 0 identified miRNAs in the database miRbase (http://www.mirbase.org) and notab ly, it is estimated that miRNAs can regulate approximately 60 % of the human genome (Friedman et al. 2009). The size of miRNAs is around ~22 nucleotides and th ey regulate gene expression by direct binding of the miRNA to the 3'UTR of a targe t messenger RNA (mRNA). MiRNA binding to target mRNA typically leads to deg radation of the mRNA or hindering the translation of the mRNA to protein (H e and Hannon 2004). One miRNA can have several mRNA targets and miRNAs are often transcribed in clusters that work in networks in fine0tuning the regulation of for example cellular processes such as proliferation, developmental timing, cell d ifferentiation, apoptosis and immune function (Bartel 2009). 44 miRNA During the canonical miRNA biogenesis pathway the m iRNA gene is transcribed in the nucleus of the cell and the pri0miRNA is cleave d by the Drosha/DGCR8 microprocessor complex into a ~70 nucleotide long p re0miRNA (Lee et al. 2003; Cullen 2004; Han et al. 2004). The hairpin0looped p re0miRNA is then transported to the cytoplasm by Exportin 5 (Lund et al. 2004) and further processed by RNAse III endonuclease Dicer to a single stranded mature miRN A (Tomari and Zamore 2005). At this stage, the mature miRNA is incorporated int o the RISC protein complex which directs the binding of the \"seed region\" of the miR NA to the 3'UTR of the target mRNA (Figure 5). This process results in the destab ilization and degradation of mRNA or directly hinder translation (Pasquinelli et al. 2005; Bartel 2009). Moreover, evidence suggests that miRNAs could exert their inhibitory function by binding to the 5'UTR of target mRNAs (Lytle et al. 2007; Orom et al. 2008). In contrast, miRNAs are also able to increase translat ion of target mRNA. \u00d8rom et al. showed that miR010a increased translation of mRNA e ncoding ribosomal proteins and by increasing ribosomal biogenesis, the level of gl obal protein synthesis was also raised (Orom et al. 2008). Furthermore a \"decoy function\" has been suggested for miRNA0 328 which independently of the 3' UTR seed sequence competitively interacts with a RNA binding protein, that normally inhibits transla tion and thereby indirectly lead to up0regulation of translation (Eiring et al. 2010). Also, epigenetic regulation by miRNAs 45 is indicated by direct binding to genomic DNA thus directing DNA methylation (Kim et al. 2008; Khraiwesh et al. 2010). Figure Figure Figure Figure 55 55.. .. The miRNA gene is transcribed and the pri0miRNAs transcript is cleaved by the Drosha/DGCR8 microprocessor complex into a pre0miRN A that is exported to the cytoplasm by Exportin 5 and processed by Dicer into shorter m ature miRNAs. The matured miRNA is then incorporated into the RISC protein complex tha t silence either translation of genes or induces the degradation of mRNAs. In addition to the canonical miRNA biogenesis (Cheloufi e t al. 2010; Cifuentes et al. 2010). The Argonaute2 (Ago 2) protein which is a me mber of the RISC complex contains a Piwi domain that acts as catalytic cente r for \"slicer\" activity that can cleave pre0miRNA transcripts (Cheloufi et al. 2010; Cifuen tes et al. 2010). There are also Drosha0independent miRNAs transcribed from introns called the mirtrons. Dicer dependent but bypasses Drosha pr RNA pre0miRNA cleavage (Okamura et al. 2007; Flynt et al. 2010). Lately, many other types of small non0coding RNAs h ave been discovered including tRNAs, piRNAs, qiRNAs, vault RNAs, lincRNAs etc. an d their Dicer dependent and independent et al. al. 2011; Yang and Lai 2011). miRNAs in miRNAs in miRNAs in miRNAs in 00 00cells cells cells cells and T1D and T1D and T1D and T1D The absence of mature miRNAs after deletion of Dice r 1 demonstrates that canonical miRNA expression overall is necessary for normal de velopment of the endocrine pancreas (Lynn et al. 2007) and for maintenance of 0cell mass as well as glucose homeostasis including insulin expression and insuli n secretion (Morita et al. 2009; Kalis et al. 2011; Mandelbaum et al. 2012). The miR0375 was among the first key miRNAs found to be highly abundant and important for the pancreatic 0cell function. It was shown that miR0375 regulates insulin secretion and maintenance of both 0and 0cell mass (Poy et al. 2004; El Ouaamari et al. 2008; Poy et al. 2009). The crucial role of miR0375 was also demonstrated during pancreatic islet development in which the absence of miR0375 resulted in malformation of the pancreatic endocrin and synthesis by inhibiting transcriptional repressors consequently resulting in increased insulin promoter activity (Melkman0Zehavi et al. 2011). The regulation of insulin secretion ion of insulin exocytosis (Lovis et al. miR021, miR034, miR146a/b and miR029 are pin pointed in the regulation of 0cells inflammatory response to pro0inflammatory cy tokines in mice and humans, thus contributing to loss of 0cell mass during the progression of diabetes. For instance, miR029 is involved in the down0regulation the anti0 apoptotic protein Monocarboxylase transporter 1 (Mcl01) that to the Bcl02 family (Roggli et al. 2010; Roggli et al. 2012). Recently, it was shown t hat a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the pre0miR034a gene in human and mouse insulinoma cell lines, led to increased amount of miR034a in islets causing increased 0cells apoptosis (Locke et al. 2013). Additionally, miR021 has been shown to be up0regulated by NF0 B activation which by mediating suppression of prog rammed cell death 4 (PDCD04) increases 0cell apoptosis through Bax (Ruan et al. 2011). miRNAs in miRNAs in miRNAs in miRNAs in T T T T cells cells cells cells and the immune system and the immune system and the immune system and the immune system The role of miRNA regulation in T cells has been in vestigated in various Dicer deletion models. Cobb et al. demonstrated by deleting Dicer during early thymoc yte development (mediated by Lck or CD4 promoters) that canonical miRNAs are essential for the number of surviving T cells but redundant for CD4 + and CD8 + lineage commitment (Cobb et al. 2005). While Dicer deletion from DP cortical thymocytes showed a moderate effect on CD4 + and CD8 + T cell numbers, the invariant NK T cell development was affected with largely dim inished numbers (Fedeli et al. 2009). Deletion of Dicer and DGCR8 in CD4 + T cells illustrated that miRNAs are also important for nTreg development and function (Cobb et al. 2006) as well as Foxp3 expression stability (Jeker et al. 2013). Cobb et al. showed that the miRNA expression profile in activated CD4 + T cells differed from the miRNA expression in regu latory T cells (Cobb et al. 2006). More recent evidence sugg ests that miRNAs expressed in 48 activated T cells mediate regulation of pathways th at would be involved in inactivation of T cell activity (Grigoryev et al. 2011). Moreover, Dicer has been shown to be crucial for CD 8 + T cell proliferation, function and migration (Zhang and Bevan 2010). Zhang et al. found this to be a consequence of the inability of Dicer deficient cells to down0r egulate CD69 after activation. CD69 down0regulation was then demonstrated to be regulat ed by miR0130/miR0301 cluster (Zhang and Bevan 2010). In CD8 + T cells, miR017092 gene cluster was up0regulated after T cell activation, but instead down0regulated in CD8 + memory T cells (Wu et al. 2012). Wu et al. demonstrated that on overexpression of miR017092 t he CD8 + T cells are driven towards effector T cell function and the development of CD8 + memory T cells is impaired (Wu et al. 2012). In contrast, th e miR0150, miR0155 and let07 family need to be up0regulated in a differentiation window during development of CD8 + memory T cells (Almanza et al. 2010). The miR0155 is essential miRNA in the regulation of overall immune system and is necessary for the immune function of B0cells, T cel ls, DCs (Tlaskalova0Hogenova et al.) and Tregs (Rodriguez et al. 2007; Thai et al. 2007; Vigorito et al. 2007; Lu et al. 2009) as well as macrophage inflammatory response ( O'Connell et al. 2007; Tili et al. 2007). Another key miRNA, miR0181a, is expressed in high levels during T cell development and is involved in altering TCR signali ng threshold (Li et al. 2007). Inhibition of miR0181a expression impaired both pos itive and negative selection. By changing the sensitivity of the TCR signaling durin g thymocyte maturation, inhibition of miR0181 was shown to lead to maturation of autor eactive CD4 + T cells (Ebert et al. 2009). Li et al. also demonstrated that miR0181a reduced expression of several phosphatases which negatively regulates TCR signali ng e.g. DUSP5/6, SHP2 and PTPN22. In other words, miR0181a increases TCR sign aling strength (Li et al. 2007). However, the deletion of miR0181a/b in early thymoc yte development only reduced 49 the overall numbers but did not change the percenta ges of TCR cell compartment (Henao0Mejia et al. 2013). This indicates the compl exity of miRNA networks and the role of miRNAs as fine0tuning regulators of gene ex pression. Recently, miR0146a was shown to be up0regulated aft er T cell activation of both CD4 + and CD8 + cells in a NF0 B dependent manner and proposed to be involved in a negative feedback loop where miR0146 up0regulation, down0regulated NF0 B partially by TRAF6 and IRAK1 signaling (Yang et al. 2012). In addition Yang et al. found that T cells lacking miR0146 are hyperactive and caused systemic T cell mediated autoimmunity and chronic inflammation in vivo . MiR010a has been shown to be preferentially express ed in Tregs, although miR010 (as well as previously mentioned miR0155) alone seems t o be dispensable for Foxp3 induction in na\u00efve T cells and overall Treg functio n (Jeker et al. 2012). This supports the notion of miRNA regulation by networks. In Stud y II, we investigated the role of the canonical miRNA network for early T cell develo pment in NOD mice and the consequences for development of T1D. miRNAs in miRNAs in miRNAs in miRNAs in cell cycle cell cycle cell cycle cell cycle checkpoint control and checkpoint control and checkpoint control and checkpoint control and apoptosis apoptosis apoptosis apoptosis Several lines of evidence suggesting that miRNAs ar e involved in the regulation of targets in the cell cycle check point and in apopto sis. The first miRNA gene families shown to regulate the p53 apoptosis pathway (implic ated in G1 cell cycle checkpoint miR029 ( miR029a/b/c) and miR034 (miR034a/b/c) gene families (Tarasov et al. 2007). In addition, up0 and down0 regulation of genes by these two miRNA gene familie s are significantly overlapping with genes regulated in DNA damage response. 50 MiRNA029 family genes were demonstrated to increase p53 activation in human cell lines through the direct suppression of two negativ e regulators of p53, the p85a subunit of phosphatidylinositol030kinase (PI3K) and CDC42 ( a Rho family GTPase), involved in controlling cellular survival and apoptosis (Par k et al. 2009). In addition, up0 regulation of miR029 was demonstrated in response t o DNA damage by suppression of the protein phosphatase Ppm1 leading to stabilizati on of p53 (Ugalde et al. 2011). Upon DNA damage the miR034 gene family (miR034a/b/c ) up0regulates p53 in both human and mice. MiR0340dependent up0regulation of p 53 induces cell0cycle arrest and apoptosis by suppression of amongst others cyclin0E 2, cyclin0dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), E2F3 and p53 downstream target b0cell lymph oma 2 (Bcl02) genes (Bommer et al. 2007; He et al. 2007; Raver0Shapira et al. 2 007; Tarasov et al. 2007). MiRNAs being negatively regulated after DNA damage have also been reported. For instance, miR0155 and miR0125 that have been demons trated to be down0regulated after DNA damage in a p530dependent manner in limbs of Drosophila melanogaster (Gueta et al. 2010). Additionally, Le et al. reported that miR0125b is a negative regulator of p53 by directly suppressing p53 protei n translation in human cell lines and zebra fish (Le et al. 2009). In a human cancer cell line, the over0expression of miR016 family genes resulted in G0/G1 cell cycle arrest by targeting CDK6 (Linsley et al. 2007). In addition, miR015a and miR01601 have shown to directly regulate Bcl02 mRNA in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients (Cimmino et al. 2005). Additionally, inhibition of miR017092 in a lung can cer cell line decreased the suppression of E2F1 leading to induction of apoptos is (O'Donnell et al. 2005; 51 Matsubara et al. 2007). E2F1 is an upstream target of p53 with a demonstrated role during negative selection in thymocyte development (Garcia et al. 2000). It is highly likely that the expression pattern of a miRNAs network is regulating several targets in the G1 cell cycle checkpoint /p53 apopto sis pathways initiating cell cycle progression or apoptosis in thymocytes. In Study I, we are investigating the contribution of miR029 (a/b/c), miR034 (a/b/c), phenotype of the NOD lympho cytes in response to DNA damage induced by 0irradiation as a model for thymocyte apoptosis ind uction during development. 52 53 AIMS OF THIS THESIS The general overall objective of this thesis was to investigate the regulatory role of miRNAs in autoimmunity, particularly in the develop ment of T1D, as well as the influence of environmental factors like gut microbi ota on intestinal inflammation and T1D. Specific aims: To investigate whether miRNAs could be involved in the molecular mechanism of thymocyte apoptosis in NOD mice To study the overall regulatory role of miRNAs in T cells and their effects on the development of T1D in NOD mice To investigate the effect of antibiotics treated pr egnant NOD mice on the immune system of the offspring, intestinal microbio ta and development of T1D To study the interplay between the gut microbiota a nd the immune system in the development of colitis, an experimental model o f IBD 54 55 METHODOLOGY Animal models Non Non Non Non00 00obese diabetic mouse obese diabetic mouse obese diabetic mouse obese diabetic mouse (NOD) (NOD) (NOD) (NOD) Since the discovery in the 1980's by the Japanese g roup Makino et al. that the inbred NOD mouse strain spontaneously develops diabetes, i t has been the most commonly used model of human T1D. Main reasons for this are the similarities of strong genetic MHC basis and pathogenesis including islet infiltra tion by mononuclear cells. The infiltration in the NOD mouse occurs at approximate ly 608 weeks of age leading to a progressive decrease of 0cell mass and development of diabetes and ketoacid osis from 12017 weeks of age (Makino et al. 1980). The involv ement of T cells in the initiation of T1D in the NOD mouse is very well studied. For e xample, it is known that both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells have been shown to be involved in the path ogenesis of T1D in NOD mice (Tisch and McDevitt 1996). Recently, T cells (expressing CD27 0 CD44 hi or CD27 +CD44 lo ) have also been shown to infiltrate islets in pre0 diabetic NOD mice and mediate diabetes development together with the T cells. Interestingly, the combined effect of both cell types on disease devel opment is more significant than the effect caused the T cells alone. In addition, the T cells were shown to be pre0 programmed to secrete IL017 or IFN0 upon activation, which may be involved in contributing to the pathogenesis of T1D by increasi ng inflammation in the pancreatic islets. Moreover, T cells isolated from spleen and pancreatic lymph nodes are reactivity against the insulin peptide (Zhang et al . 2010). In contrast, the T cells have also been demonstrated to be involved in the p rotection against T1D by up0 regulation of TGF0 production (Han et al. 2010). 56 Another advantage of the animal model is the high d iabetes incidence of 60080 % in NOD females (Makino et al. 1980). However, the sex0 bias in the disease incidence in the NOD mouse differs compared to human T1D where t he incidence is fairly similar in both sexes. The NOD mouse has similar genetic pr e0disposition as humans with T1D susceptibility linked dominantly to the MHC cla ss II, which is encoded by the I0 Ag7 gene in mouse and is equivalent to the HLA class I I gene in human (Wicker et al. 1995). In addition, recessive genes have been mappe d in more than 20 susceptibility regions0 the Idd regions. However, new data suggest s that NOD mouse has more association to T2D genes than T1D which are related to insulin resistance, vascular pathology and endoplasmic reticulum stress (Chaparr o et al. 2006). Some developmental defects affecting central tolera nce of the NOD mouse have previously been highlighted. Yui et al. demonstrated that defective 0selection checkpoint control which allows further differentia tion of NOD thymocytes in the absence of functional pre0TCR signaling (Yui and Ro thenberg 2004). Further, Kishimoto et al. reported that defective thymic negative selection caused by decreased sensitivity of thymocytes to undergo apoptosis, inv olves both Fas0dependent and (Kishimoto and Sprent 2001). P eripheral NOD lymphocytes have also been shown to be apoptosis resistant in r esponse to treatment with apoptosis inducing agents (Colucci et al. 1996). These defect s in apoptosis of NOD lymphocytes may allow escape of autoreactive T cells and contri bute to the breakdown of central and peripheral tolerance in the NOD mouse and final ly resulting in the pre0disposition to the development of autoimmune diabetes. C57BL/6 C57BL/6 C57BL/6 C57BL/6 The C57BL/6 (also referred to as B6) is one of the most commonly used inbred strains of wild0type mice. In Study I, where NOD lymphocyte apoptosis resistance in response 57 to 0irradiation was investigated, the C57BL/6 mice wer e used as control mice. In Study IV, DSS treatment was performed on C57BL/6 mice to induce intestinal inflammation. This genetic background is susceptibl e for induction of inflammatory pathology of ulcerative colitis with DSS (Melgar et al. 2005). NOD. NOD. NOD. NOD.Lck Lck Lck 00Cre 1 Dicer 1 Dicer 1 // // mice mice mice mice In Study II, we used Dicer flox/flox mice and backcrossed for 11 generations with NOD mice to generate a NOD.DicerFlox mouse. Then Cre0Lo x system was used to mediate deletion of Lck (involved in signaling of the T cel l receptor) by the Cre recombinase. This generated a mouse with T cell specific Dicer 1 deletion and thus also the absence of mature canonical miRNAs in T cells from the DN4 stage of T cell development. The NOD.Lck0Cre Dicer 1 / mouse was characterized in Study II. Flow Cytometry Fluorescence assisted cell sorting (FACS) is a meth od used in all our studies to ex vivo detect different cell T cell populations in thymus and peripheral lymph nodes based on the expression of cell surface markers, as well as intracellular markers like the transcription factor Foxp3, using fluorescently lab eled antibodies. FACS was also used in Study I to assess the amount of apoptotic cells in thymus respectively pancreatic islets of different mouse strains, which is further descri bed in the next section about apoptosis assays. FACS is based on a system of lasers that hit a stre am of single cells which flow in a suspension through the nozzle. The light is deflect ed by the cells into mirrors that directs specific wavelengths of light to detectors by filters (Figure 6). The forward scatter (FSC) is giving information about the size of the cell whereas side scatter gives 58 information about the granularity of the cell (Orti s et al.). The color detectors collect emitted light from the excited flurochromes on the antibodies used to detect specific cell markers. Different fluorochromes have differen t emission spectra and each marker can therefore be detected in separate channels. The computer software converts the information relayed by the detectors to digital inf ormation that can be visualized and analyzed in histograms and plots. Figure Figure Figure Figure 66 66.. .. FACS is a laser0based technique used to study cel l populations defined by expression of specific cellular markers that are fluorescently labeled by antibodies. As the single0cell suspension is passing through the laser beam fluoro chrome on the antibodies is excited and emits a specific wavelength of light which after be ing deflected by mirrors is passing through filters into detectors. Forward scatter detects the size of the cell and side scatter detects the granularity. The color detectors can catch emission spectra from different fluorochromes in the different channels (FL01 to FL03 in the figure) use d to identify different cellular markers. The signals are visualized in computer software as hist I to assess the cellul ar apoptosis of thymocytes by measuring the percentage of cells in the subdiploid peak. The fluorescent stain binds to the major groove of DNA and thus shows the DNA content of the cell and is also used to visualize the cell cycle progression of the cells in the samp le.

The cell sample was incubated with the deoxynucleotidyl transferase that incorpor ate nucleotides that cannot be further extended, the dUTPs, into single0strand bre aks in the DNA of apoptotic cells therefore giving the reaction the name terminal nic k labeling. The dUTPs are 60 fluorescently labeled and the fluorescence of the d UTPs incorporated in the DNA of the cells in the sample can be measured for example with flow cytometry.

TaqMan quantitative PCR (qPCR) Analysis of miRNA expression in Study I and II was performed using the TaqMan technology from Applied Biosystems which can differ entiate between precursor and mature miRNAs and also between different miRNAs in a gene family that only differes by one nucleotide. Target specific stem0loop primer s are used in the reverse transcription reaction to amplify miRNA sequence fr om total RNA including short <200 nt fragments (prepared with Qiagen miRNAeasy). The product is then used in a quantitative real0time PCR with fluorescently label ed probes using the reporter dye FAM (60carboxy0fluorescein) and ROX as the quencher dye. 61 Figure Figure Figure Figure 99 99.. ..

Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism ( T- RFLP) TRFL0P is a PCR based method used to analyze intest inal microbiota and was used in Study III and IV. First, a PCR reaction is performe d with fluorescently labeled, random hexamer primers that are used to amplify the bacter ial genomic DNA and the PCR product is then cleaved by a restriction enzyme (Ms p I was used in studies III0IV) and different bacterial strains will be restricted diff erently based on the genomic sequence of the bacteria. The fragments formed are sequenced and based on the length of the restricted fragments; the fluorescence from the seq uences will be different which is represented as peaks in the analysis program. Since the peak area will be different for different bacterial strains different bacterial tax a will have lower or higher relative peak area (peak area of bacterial strain/total peak area ). A principal component analysis (PCA), which is a statistical method, was used to v isualize differences in samples with 62 same the properties. PCA clusters the bacterial tax a present in intestine based on the relative peak area in the sample. Figure Figure Figure Figure 10 10 10 10.. .. The principle of TRFL0P. Bacterial genomic DNA is extracted and PCR amplification with strain specific, fluorescently l abeled primers is performed. The PCR product is digested with a restriction enzyme and restricti on fragment sequenced after gel electrophoresis. The detected fluorescence is presented by a compute r software as peaks in graph plotting fragment size against fluorescence intensity. Diffe rent bacterial strain DNA will be restricted differently and therefore one fluorescence peak det ected will correspond to the relative amount of a specific bacterial taxa. Cytokine detection assay (Luminex) Cytokine analysis was performed on Serum from mice (study IV) using the bead0based Luminex platform. The beads which are bound to the primary catch antibody, were first incubated with the serum. After washing away excess substrate not bound to the beads, the secondary antibody coupled with phycoery thrin (PE), were added. After a final wash the plate was read similarly to an ELISA assay. The advantages the Luminex assay is its multiplexing capability which can anal yze several protein analytes at the same time. This is made possible due to the different re gions of the bead that emit 63 fluorescence when excited by a laser. The measured fluorescence is re0calculated by the software based on a standard curve using regression 0analysis into concentrations of cytokines in the serum. Figure Figure Figure Figure 11 11 11 11. The principle of the Bio0Plex system. A magneti c bead bound to a catch antibody is incubated with the substrate (biomarker of interest ). Excess unbound substrate is washed away and a secondary antibody coupled to a flourochrome (PE), is added. After incubation with the secondary antibody and a final washing step, a plat e reader is used to detect the biomarker of interest. The emitted fluorescence is detected afte r being excitation by a laser. The computer software then employs a mathematical algorithm to c alculate the concentration of the biomarker of interest in the sample. 64 65 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Study I Clonal deletion during thymocyte maturation is esse ntial to avoid defective and potentially self0reactive T cells. Defects in T cel l maturation in the NOD mouse has previously been described, both at the cell0cycle c heckpoint after 0selection and during negative selection. More specifically, Yui et al. have demonstrated defects in the 0 selection checkpoint control allowing continued thy mocyte development even in absence of proper pre0TRC re0arrangement (Yui and R othenberg 2004). Also, Kishimoto et al. have shown that NOD thymocytes have increased apop tosis resistance during negative selection (Kishimoto and Sprent 200 1). This might ultimately contribute to breakdown of the central tolerance an d predispose the NOD mouse for the development of spontaneous T1D. There are reports suggesting that p53 is involved i n regulation of the cell0cycle checkpoint and apoptosis after 0selection (Guidos et al. 1996; Jiang et al. 1996; Haks et al. 1999; Costello et al. 2000). Additionally, d uring negative selection thymocytes with high affinity to self0antigens are deleted by apoptosis potentially via p53 regulation (Zhu et al. 1999; Quaglino and Ronchetti 2001). Also, peripheral NOD lymphocytes have been observed to have a defect apoptosis induction in response to apoptosis inducing agents (Leijon et al. 1994; Colucci et al. 1996; Lamhamedi0Cherradi et al. 1998). In Study I, we confirmed previous observations by s howing that NOD thymocytes and lymphocytes are apoptosis resistant in response to treatment with low dose (6 Gy) 66 whole body 0irradiation. Apoptosis of thymocytes and periphera l lymphocytes from NOD and wild0type (C57BL/6) mice was analyzed with TUNEL and PI staining and visualized with flow cytometry. We show that there are lower percentage of cells in both thymus and lymph nodes of NOD mice that underwent a poptosis ten hours after 0 irradiation compared with B6 wild0type mice. Several miRNA gene families have been shown to be i nvolved in p530mediated apoptosis gene families. MiR029a has been demonstrated to stabiliz e p53 by suppressing a regulatory subunit (p85 ) of PI3K and the Rho family GTPase CDC42 (Park et al. 2009). Additionally, Bommer et al. showed that miR034a expression is directly up0regu lated by p53 (Bommer et al. 2007). MiR034a is proposed to be involved in a positive feedback loop with p53 by suppressing the Silent in formation regulator 1 (SIRT1) (Yamakuchi et al. 2008; Yamakuchi and Lowenstein 20 09). Conversely, miR0125b and miR0155 were demonstrated to be negative regulators of p53 and are down0regulated after DNA damage (Le et al. 2009; Gueta et al. 2010 ). In this study, we investigated the expression of miRNAs 34 a/b/c, miR029a, miR0125 b, miR0155 and miR0203 We show that the miR034 gene family (miR034a/ b/c) expression profile is different in NOD thymocytes compared to wild0type B 6 thymocytes (Figure 12a). In addition, miR034b and miR034c were not properly up0 regulated in NOD after 0irradiation compared to B6 thymocytes (Figure 12b) . There is also differential expression of miR0125b in NOD thymocytes compared t o B6 mice both before and after 0irradiation (Figure 12c) resulting in a net down0r egulation of miR0125b in NOD thymocytes compared to B6 mice (Figure 12d). Mo reover, the expression of miR0155 were higher in NOD thymocytes compared to B 6 after 0irradiation (Figure 67 12e) resulting in a net up0regulation in miR0155 in NOD thymocytes after 0 irradiation (Figure 12f). Figure Figure Figure Figure 11 1122 22.. ..

(b) The delta expression of miR034 gene family, comparing b efore and after irradiation, shows that miR0 34b and miR034c are not properly up0regulated in NO D thymocytes compared to B6 mice. (c) The miR0125b is differentially expressed in NOD thy mocytes before and after 0irradiation compared to B6 mice. (d) The delta expression of mi R0125b shows a down0regulation in NOD thymocytes compared to B6 thymocytes after irradiat ion. (e) The miR0155 is differentially expressed in NOD thymocytes after 0irradiation compared to B6 mice. (f) The delta exp ression of miR0155 shows that altered miRNA regulation network in NOD lymphocytes could contribute to defective apoptosis regulation in NOD lymphocytes. Particularly, the defect up0regulation of the miR034b and c after 0irradiation in NOD thymocytes 68 (Figure 11c, d). However, it has also been reported that miR034 gene family is redundant in the regulation of p53 and down0streams targets p21, Bax, Mdm2 as well as PUMA in vivo in mouse thymus (Concepcion et al. 2012). We therefore investigated the protein expression of several targets in the cell0cycle (c0 abl, cyclin D1, p21, p27) and p53 in NOD lymphocyte s by Western blot. We could show that p53 was the only target which was not pro perly up0regulated in NOD thymocytes and peripheral lymphocytes compared to w ild0type mice after 0irradiation (figure 13). Figure Figure Figure Figure 13 13 13 13.. .. Defective up0regulation of p53 in NOD thymocytes and peripheral lymphocytes after 0irradiation compared to wild0type B6 mice. In conclusion, our data suggest that altered expres sion level of miR034a/b/c and miR0125b in NOD thymocytes compared to B6 thymocyte s could explain the defective up0regulation of p53 in NOD lymphocytes a nd thus contribute to the apoptosis resistance phenotype in NOD lymphocytes. This could ultimately contribute to impairing central and peripheral tole rance and predispose the NOD mouse to autoimmune diabetes. 69 Study II Canonical miRNAs have been shown to be important in the early development of T cells and the absence of miRNAs greatly affect T cell numbers but does not impair the CD4/CD8 lineage commitment (Cobb et al. 2005). Deletion of canonical miRNAs from CD4 + T cells results in defective differentiation of nT regs in the thymus and induction/stability of Foxp3 in peripheral Tregs (C obb et al. 2006; Jeker et al. 2013). Moreover, T cell response in vivo in CD8 + T cells that lack canonical miRNAs is reduced (Zhang and Bevan 2010). Zhang et al. also demonstrated that despite increased activation and proliferation in vitro the CD8 + T cells lacking canonical miRNAs failed to down0regulate CD69 which probably inhibited the cells migration ability in vivo (Zhang and Bevan 2010). In this study, we investigated how deletion of cano nical miRNAs during early thymocyte development in NOD mice would affect the overall immunological balance between the effector T cells and Tregs and how this would affect the outcome of diabetes development. Initially, we validated the d eletion of Dicer1 in sorted DP splenocytes of the NOD.Lck0Cre Dicer1 / mouse. We then performed an immunophenotyping of the T cell p opulations of primary and secondary lymphoid organs. We found that the total cellularity of the thymus, spleen and MLN but not peri0pancreatic LN (pLN) of the NOD .Lck0Cre Dicer1 / mouse was decreased. The immunophenotyping by flow cytome try showed a significant decrease in the DP thymocytes but only a slight and not significant decrease in the amount of nTregs in the thymus of the NOD.Lck0Cre Dicer1 / mouse compared to NOD. Dicer1flox/flox control littermates. Similarly to published data by Cobb et al., we show that the cell populations that decreased mainl y belonged to the T cells with no significant increase in the T cells. Furthermore, we observed a significant 70 reduction of CD8 + T cells in both spleen and MLN in addition to a si gnificant decrease of CD4 + T cells in the spleen of NOD.Lck0Cre Dicer1 / mice compared to NOD. Dicer1flox/flox mice. However, there was only a slight non0signific ant decrease of nTregs in the secondary lymphoid organs (spleen, ML N and pLN). Interestingly, the percentage of CD4 + and CD8 + effector memory T cells was increased in spleen an d MLN of NOD.Lck0Cre Dicer1 / mice. However, when the results were normalized for the amount of cells there was a reduction in th e total number of effector memory T cells. This indicates that the lack of canonical miRNA network is driving the CD4 + and CD8 + T cells into memory phenotype. Unfortunately, we h ave not yet elucidated the importance of specific miRNAs in the different immunophenotyped T cell populations. We will next perform a miRNA profiling to be able to study the regulatory role of particular miRNAs or groups of miRNAs for t he function of different T cell populations. In the future we will also study the f unctionality of the NOD.Lck0Cre Dicer1 / effector cells respectively Treg cells in vivo by adoptive transfer experiments. Here, we show the overall effects of canonical miRN A deletion in different T cell populations for the development of autoimmune diabe tes. Also, we showed a significantly decreased leukocyte infiltration in N OD.Lck0Cre Dicer1 / pancreatic islets compared to NOD. Dicer1flox/flox control littermates. Finally, we investigated the diabetes incidence of NOD.Lck0Cre Dicer1 / mice. We did not observe a difference in the diabetes incidence of NOD.Lck0Cre Dicer1 / females compared with control littermates but a significant increase in the diabe tes incidence of male NOD.Lck0Cre Dicer1 / mice. 71 Figure Figure Figure Figure 14 14 14 14.. .. Diabetes incidence of the female and male NOD.Lck 0Cre Dicer1 / mice. There is no difference in diabetes incidence of the female N OD.Lck0Cre Dicer1 / mice compared to mice NOD. littermates and NOD.Lck0Cre (left panel). Male NOD.Lck0Cre Dicer1 / mice displayed significantly higher diabetes incidence (Student's two0tailed, p<0.01=**) / wt heterozygote littermates. Due to the differential diabetes incidence between the genders we can speculate on the potential involvement of sex hormone0mediated regul ation of miRNAs in our model. Sex0mediated differential miRNA expression patterns are present in both humans and mice (Ilnytskyy et al. 2008; Ciaudo et al. 2009; La ngevin et al. 2010). More specifically, estrogen up0regulate transcription of a group of mi RNAs and there are indications that Dicer might be regulated by estrogen (Bhat0Nakshatr i et al. 2009; Shao et al. 2011). Further, certain miRNAs have also been shown to reg ulate the levels androgen expression in prostate cancer cells (Ostling et al. 2011; Hagman et al. 2013). 72 Additionally, androgen has been demonstrated to reg ulate Dicer and is proposed to be involved in a positive feedback0loop in which andro gen is increasing miRNA expression which in turn increases androgen levels (Narayanan et al. 2010). Indeed, there seems to be a link between sex0hormone regulation and miR NAs that could potentially generate differential outcome in T cell proliferati on and ultimately result in different disease incidence of T1D. Study III Commensal gut microbiota is important for proper de velopment of the immune system and maintenance of tolerance in the intestinal trac t in several ways. Certain gut microbiota is linked to T1D and children with T1D ( or progressing towards T1D) display altered gut microbiota with decreased amoun t of bacteria of the Firmicute phylum and increased amount of bacteria belonging t o the Bacteroidetes phylum (Giongo et al. 2011). The maternal gut microbiota i s the first source of bacteria which the child comes in contact with and could influence the development of the immune system of the infant. Therefore, in order to unders tand how the gut microbiota could potentially affect the immune system and diabetes d evelopment in the offspring, we investigated the effect of induced disturbance of c ommensal maternal gut microbiota by antibiotic treatment. This is an important subje ct because it is common for pregnant women to receive antibiotics for different infectio ns during pregnancy (Lim et al. 2003; Andrade et al. 2004; Le et al. 2004; Chan et al. 20 13). In addition, antibiotics treatment of pregnant mothers has recently been associated wi th increased risk of allergic disease but little is known about the effects for the devel opment of T1D (McKeever et al. 2002; Metsala et al. 2013). 73 We treated the pregnant NOD mice with a broad0spect rum antibiotics mix consisting of neomycin, polymyxin and metronidazol to alter th e normal maternal gut microbiota. Next, we followed the development of spontaneous T1 D development in the NOD offspring. By performing a TRFL0P analysis we found that the offspring to NOD mice treated with antibiotics displayed decreased divers ity of intestinal microbiota and also differential clustering of the present microbiota, which was illustrated by clustering of the intestinal gut microbiota (TRFs) with a PCA ana lysis. This means that modulation of the maternal intestinal microbiota with antibiot ics resulted in both decreased diversity and changed the composition of the intest inal microbiota in the offspring. Figure Figure Figure Figure 15 15 15 15.. .. The clustering of the intestinal gut microbiota w ith PCA. There is different clustering of the TRFs in offspring to mothers trea ted with antibiotics mix during pregnancy compared to offspring to control mothers. Next, we performed T cell analysis of different T c ell populations from MLN and Peyer's patches in offspring to mothers treated wit h antibiotics and control mothers. We show that there was a significant decrease of pe rcentage gated CD3 +CD8 + T cells 74 in the MLN of offspring to mothers treated with ant ibiotics. In the Peyer's patches we show a significant reduction in the percentage gate d CD3 +CD4 +CD25 + T cells in the offspring to mothers treated with antibiotics durin g pregnancy. Additionally, there was a significant decrease in the percentage gated na\u00efv e CD4 +CD62L + T cells and CD4 +CD62L 0 memory T cells in the Peyer's patches of offspring to treated mothers. Interestingly, the modulation of intestinal microbi ota during pregnancy due to antibiotics treatment seems to have influenced alte rations in T cell populations in MLN and Peyer's patches. Additionally, we investigated if these changes in t he intestinal gut microbiota and T cell alterations of the NOD offspring would contrib ute to altered development of T1D diabetes. We show a modulation of diabetes in the o ffspring to mothers treated with antibiotics at 20 weeks of age but at the end of th e monitoring period at 30 weeks of age there is no significant difference in diabetes incidence between the offspring groups. Figure Figure Figure Figure 16 16 16 16.. .. In the offspring from mothers treated with antibi otics during pregnancy there seems to be a modulation of diabetes incidence (p<0.05= * ) at 20 weeks of age but at the end of the monitoring period there is no significant differenc e in diabetes incidence between the two offspring groups. 75 In conclusion, we show that the modulation of the m aternal gut microbiota during pregnancy with antibiotics treatment generated pers istent changes in the intestinal gut microbiota diversity and composition of the offspri ng. These changes seem to have induced the demonstrated alterations of different T cell populations in the MLN and Peyer's patches in offspring to mothers treated wit h antibiotics during pregnancy. Although we believe that these effects modulate the development of T1D in the offspring from the antibiotics treated mothers at 2 0 weeks of age, we could not observe persistent effects. Further studies in a human popu lation would be needed to fully understand the potential risk factors of antibiotic s treatment during pregnancy for the development of autoimmune diabetes. Study IV It is known that the interaction between the immune system and the intestinal microbiota can be important for the outcome of inte stinal inflammation and UC. However, how the global composition of intestinal m icrobiota changes and ultimately contribute to the disease is not completely underst ood. To study this we used the DSS model because it is the most commonly used animal m odel for UC and because of the many clinical and histopathological similarities wi th human UC (Okayasu et al. 1990; Melgar et al. 2005). We induced UC in wild0type C57BL/6 mice through che mical induction by administration of 4 % DSS in the drinking water. Th e mice were then analyzed for the relationship between UC and gut microbiota as well as the immune response. The analysis of the colonic intestinal microbiota was p erformed with TRFL0P. Although we 76 did not find any decrease in overall diversity we s how a differential clustering pattern after PCA of the intestinal gut microbiota in the D SS group comparing to control mice. Figure 17. Figure 17. Figure 17. Figure 17. PCA 3D plot showing the bacterial cluste ring pattern. There is differential clustering of the DSS treated animals (green circles) and cont rol animals (red circles). Our qPCR analysis showed that the amount of Lactobacillus decreased whereas the number of bacteria belonging to the Akkersmansia and Desulfovibrio genera increased after DSS treatment. Additionally, Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli ) was present at a much higher incidence in the DSS group compared to control group. In concordance with our results an increase in Bacteroides , Clostridium and decrease in the Lactobacillus genera is reported to be associated with UC in huma ns and mice (Fabia et al. 1993; Garcia0Lafuente et al. 1997). Moreover, in support to our qPCR data, the increased presence of the Desulfovibrio and Enterobacteriaceae genera has been associated with UC in humans (Mylonaki et al. 2005; Rowan et al. 2010) . Interestingly, Akkersmansia 77 muciniphila is a mucin degrading bacteria (Eckburg et al. 2005 ) and could thus be involved in the degradation of the colonic mucous l ayer during UC. Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 18 8 88.. .. Mucosal bacterial populations identified with qPC R. Mann0Whitney rank test, p< 0.05= *; p<0.01= **. The intestinal neutrophil infiltration was assessed by myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and was found to be increased in colon but not in s mall intestine. MPO is a neutrophil enzyme and has previously been associated with incr eased neutrophil infiltration during UC (Kristjansson et al. 2004). To assess the level of systemic inflammation, inflammatory cytokines in serum were investigated. We showed an increase in pro0 inflammatory cytokines IL06, IL017 and the chemokin e KC concordance to our results, these pro0inflammato ry cytokines have previously been shown during the pathogenesis of chronic IBD in hum ans and mice and more specifically, IL017 is connected to induction of Th 17 cells (Yen et al. 2006; Alex et al. 2009; Holtta et al. 2013). 78 We additionally analyzed different lymphocyte popul ations, M , and DCs in spleen, Peyer's patches and MLN using flow cytometry. We fo und significantly increased percentage of Tregs (co0expressing CTLA04) in splee n, MLN, Peyer's patches. In spite of the presence of intestinal inflammation, we obse rved increased frequency of Tregs. In support, similar findings have been reported by H\u00f6ltt\u00e4 et al. in children with UC who demonstrated an increase in colonic Tregs (Holt ta et al. 2013). It is possible that even in the presence of the increased frequency of Tregs these cells cannot reverse the disease progression (Yu et al. 2007). Alternatively , the functionality of the Tregs might be inhibited by TLR signaling. We also showed increased percentage of CD11b +CD11c + expressing and CD11c +TLR0 4+ DCs cells in the MLN. Increased TLR signaling may indicate increased interaction between intestinal microbiota and the immune system . In other words, the enhanced interaction could be an effect of altered gut micro biota which results in greater immune responses leading to intestinal inflammation (Hart et al. 2005). By investigating the changes in gut microbiota duri ng DSS0induced colitis and the immunophenotype we can contribute to a more clear u nderstanding of the active role that the intestinal microbiota play in the interact ion with the gut immune system during intestinal inflammation in UC. 79 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS In the first two studies of this thesis the role of miRNA regulation was investigated in NOD mice. In Study I, we investigated the role of m iRNA034 gene family (miR0 34a/b/c), miR029 gene family (miR029a/b/c), miR0155 and miR0203 in the regulation of p530dependent DNA damage response in thymocytes in response to 0irradiation. We show that NOD lymphocytes are apop tosis resistant in response to 0irradiation compared to wild0type B6 mice. There i s differential expression of miR0 34a before 0irradiation and miR034b/c before and after 0irradiation in NOD thymocytes compared to B6 thymocytes. Additionally, we show that miR0125b was differentially expressed before and after 0irradiation as well as miR0155 after 0 irradiation in NOD thymocytes compared to B6 mice. Finally, we also show that p53 is not properly up0regulated in NOD thymocytes in r esponse to 0irradiation. We believe that this might be mediated by the miRNAs d ifferentially expressed between the NOD and B6 thymocytes during the apoptosis resp onse to 0irradiation. In conclusion, altered miRNA network affecting the lev el of p53 expression in NOD thymocytes during cell0cycle checkpoint and apoptos is during development may influence the establishment of central tolerance an d predispose the NOD mouse to T1D development. In Study II, the overall role of canonical miRNAs i n the NOD mouse was investigated by deletion of the mature miRNAs using the Cre0Lox system at the DN3 stage of early thymocyte development. The effect of lacking mature canonical miRNAs resulted in reduced overall cellularity of secondary lymphoid o rgans spleen, MLN and pLN. The immunophenotyping of the NOD.Lck0Cre Dicer1 / mice show a significant decrease of CD4 + and CD8 + T cell populations in the thymus, spleen and MLN. Additionally, we show a slight non0statistically de crease in nTregs in thymus, spleen, 80 MLN and pLN. There was also an increased ratio of m emory T cells in the spleen and MLN of the NOD.Lck0Cre Dicer1 / mice. Although there was lower leukocyte infiltration in the pancreatic islets, we could not show any difference in the diabetes incidence between the female NOD.Lck0Cre Dicer1 / mice and control littermates. However, there was an increase in diabetes incidenc e of male. In short, canonical miRNAs are important for generation of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells as well as nTregs in the primary and secondary organs of the NOD.Lck0 Cre Dicer1 / mice. It is probable that canonical miRNAs are also important f or the function of the different T cell populations, which will be investigated in fut ure studies. In Study III, we studied the effect of derangement of maternal intestinal microbiota on the offspring, particularly for the development of T1D. The maternal intestinal microbiota was modulated by treating the pregnant N OD mice with antibiotics and we found decreased diversity and a persistent modul ation of the intestinal microbial pattern in the offspring. We also demonstrated immu nological alterations including CD8 + T cell frequencies in the MLN and CD3 +CD4 +CD25 + as well as CD4 +CD62L 0 T cell frequencies and in Peyer's patches. These ch anges may have influenced the increase in the diabetes incidence of offspring to treated mothers at 20 weeks of age although the effect was not persistent. In conclusi on, our results indicate the importance of the maternal gut microbiota for the i mmunological tolerance in the offspring. In Study IV, we wanted to clarify the relationship between the global intestinal microbiota and the immune system in the DSS induced UC mouse model. We showed changes in the overall colonic intestinal microbiot a pattern after DSS treatment. In addition, we a showed a significant decrease in Lactobacillus and significant increase in Akkersmansia and Desulfovibrio as well as higher incidence of Enterobacteriaceae . We 81 demonstrated immunological alterations of different populations of T cells, DCs and NK cells after UC induction. These include signific ant increase of T cells, particularly CD8 + T cells in the MLN of DSS treated mice. Additionall y, we showed significant increase in Tregs co0expressing CTLA04 in the splee n, Peyer's patches and MLN in DSS group. Finally, we demonstrated significant inc rease in monocytes and DCs co0 expressing TLR04 in the MLN. In conclusion, our res ults indicate that the intestinal microbiota actively interacts with the immune syste m in UC. 82 83 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Jag skulle forskning och samarbete! f\u00f6r du har mig att utvecklas som doktorand och och pedagogiska v\u00e4gledning v\u00e4xa l att ha nytta av de kunskaper man fick de Susanne och 84 Christina som var med oss ett tag, tack f\u00f6r all er praktiska hj\u00e4lp Lily and Ileana 0 we have not forgotten you and your contribution to our lab, especially since you broug ht some sunshine to us from much warmer places the world!
