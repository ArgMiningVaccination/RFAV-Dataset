They lead to chronic fatigue... poor sleep... brain fog... worsen infections (especially candida)... inflammation and pain... it's ENDLESS. These toxic metals are everywhere, and they're quietly responsible so many of the symptoms we experience: whether it's low-energy... brain issues... immune system weakness... brain issues... stubborn fat (slow metabolism)... chronic pain... and more. Unless you get these toxins (especially the metals) OUT \u2014 you'll never be truly healthy. You won't have the energy you want. You won't have the body you want. This Is Where Heavy Metal Detoxification Comes In Think of your body as a bucket. Now imagine the toxins that surround us in daily life are the liquid that slowly fills that bucket. With each toxic exposure, drop-by-drop, your bucket becomes more full. A drop here and there isn't such a big deal; however, chronic exposure to an onslaught of chemical, physical and emotional stressors fills up your bucket each day, and at some point the bucket begins to overflow. It may take a few decades before your bucket spills over, but once it does, cellular inflammation is triggered and unwanted symptoms arise. The Heavy Metal Detox process begins by determining which sources of stress may be causing body-wide damage and supporting the body's natural ability to remove them. Removing the toxic source that has accumulated over time in the body is essential to getting results, and can be where health restoration begins. Heavy Metal Detox Program supports the body's natural ability to detox\u2014on a cellular level\u2014which can help you realize your greatest level of health. "}
