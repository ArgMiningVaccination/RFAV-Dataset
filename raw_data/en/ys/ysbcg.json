For those of you who have been friends of Our Nature for a while, you'll remember David because he was a guest on Episode 19 of Season 1 where he shared his incredible healing journey, guided by his intuition. Today, we do a deep dive into somatic energy healing - what it is, how it works, why it matters, David's gift of clairsentience, why more people don't do energy work, the root of many physical and emotional illnesses and the incredible healing that energy work can offer. I speak with David every day, but it was truly an honor and a joy to connect with him in this episode. David is not only a powerful healer, he's an equally powerful speaker. Embodiment is necessary in order to connect with nature in any meaningful capacity, so if you're struggling with anxiety, depression or a lot of mental activity, this episode is for you. Enjoy! \"All of our physical, emotional and cognitive issues arise from an energetic base.\" - David Sleininger x Our Nature \"We are all interacting with the energetic world already whether we are aware of it or not. And a lot of what happens is: we have an experience - and consciously or subconsciously - we talk ourselves out of the fact that that was an energetic experience.\" - David Sleininger x Our Nature \"If you've ever had the experience of being beneficially supported by nature, you are already embodied.\" - David Sleininger x Our Nature \"Nature presents me with (everyday, all day long) endless opportunities to wake up and to grow. And it calls me to be increasingly wise and adept in how to work with those feelings and experiences.\" - David Sleininger x Our Nature Resources [EP 19: (Season 1 Finale!)
