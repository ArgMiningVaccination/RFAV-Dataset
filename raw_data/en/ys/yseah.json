A: We focus on various areas but first and foremost the organization focuses on highlighting the countless benefits vaccines have brought to society. Thanks to these vaccines, life expectancy has extended to almost 80 years. In addition, we are committed to generating tangible changes in the field of vaccination. We aim to promote a better understanding of the importance of vaccines and their scope in Mexico and beyond. Our ultimate goal is to research and advocate for improvements in vaccine administration and acceptance. Mexico faces a series of challenges regarding vaccine acceptance. We find ourselves in a complex situation that transcends national borders. However, in the specific context of Mexico, we encounter particular obstacles that influence vaccine acceptance. This situation is reflected in declining coverage rates, reaching as low as 30% in some areas. We are seeing a perfect storm in Mexico with three essential components. First, there is hesitancy among certain individuals to receive some vaccines like COVID-19, HPV or influenza. Second, we have had problems with the supply of vaccines. Third, during the pandemic, many people did not receive their vaccines. Q: What information should the general public know about vaccines? A: The first vaccine was discovered in 1796 by Edward Jenner. He observed that women who milked cows with lesions on their udders, which is cowpox or vaccinia, would get these lesions on their hands and they would no longer contract smallpox. He then collected the pus from these lesions and applied it to children to vaccinate them from smallpox. Vaccines teach the body how to fight off a microorganism by injecting a weakened or dead virus or fragments of the virus or bacteria. When the body encounters the pathogen again, it knows how to destroy it. Vaccines exist only for viruses and bacteria but we hope to have more for parasites in the future. Q: What measures are required to address the vaccine backlog in Mexico resulting from the pandemic? A: Political will, public commitment and healthcare workers' dedication are required. It is essential to work together because even if we have vaccines, they will not be effective if people do not get vaccinated. Just having vaccines stored is not enough; it is important to administer them to every individual. This calls for a collective effort involving the government, healthcare workers, civil societies, international organizations and individuals to reestablish vaccination efforts. This will not happen in a year or two as it will likely take at least five years to regain momentum. Q: How do you envision the continued significance of COVID-19 vaccines in terms of public health? A: The future is uncertain because the extent of change and the need for novel approaches to combat COVID-19 remain unclear. Initial concerns lie in securing reliable manufacturing and secondary concerns involve governments' willingness to invest. A third concern is public engagement. While some expected an increased drive toward vaccination following the pandemic, there is now a sense of vaccine fatigue, with people averse to discussions surrounding vaccines. The field is focusing on creating new vaccines. There are more than 25 vaccines that fend off 25 infectious diseases. These vaccines have reshaped history by eradicating one disease, smallpox in 1980, and significantly curtailing others, such as pertussis, rubella, tetanus, influenza and hepatitis B. Looking ahead, we anticipate that new vaccination technologies will grant us tools against seemingly intractable diseases like HIV, diverse fungi and more. We must restore the use of existing vaccines to prevent resurgences of diseases we previously thought were under control, like measles, rubella, hepatitis, pneumonia and meningitis. Second, we must navigate the integration of new vaccines into healthcare systems and motivate wider acceptance among the populace. Q:What is the status of HIV vaccine development? A: There are more than 20 ongoing initiatives for this vaccine but many have not succeeded. Those that were part of the Mosaico initiative fell apart. The virus itself is the obstacle because it has the ability to change, which renders the antibodies that are created ineffective. That is why this vaccine has not been successful so far but it is expected that it can be developed in the next 10 "}
