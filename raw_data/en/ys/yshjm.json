Rounds can be as early as 5am, but usually 6:30 7am. Check with on- call resident at end of each day they will typically text you. One student each week will be on call for the whole week, including weekends. We will call your cell phone with any ED calls. Page 3 of 11 Planning your Month 1. Feel free to bring your own lunch. There are refrigerators and microwaves available. There is also a cafeteria at the hospital and clinic. 2. Plan to be on call , including nights and weekends; usually one week per month. This is home call. 3. If you know you need time off, let us know when you get here so we can plan around it. 4. You will need a vehicle to travel to/ from the hospital and clinic. 5. Any evaluation forms that need to be done should be given to Dr. Pfannenstein or the 2nd year residents. 6. Students should wear clinic attire on Tuesday and Thursday at clinic , while scrubs are fine for the other days . Light blue scrubs are available at the HPSC; dark green scrubs are available at Regions Hospital (Regions scrubs are not allowed to leave the facility) . Men do not need to wear a tie. Students will be provided with long white coats to wear at clinic. Do not bring you coat to clinic. No coat is needed in the hospital either. Clinic is on the 3rd floor at HPSC. 7. If you ever have any questions, feel free to page any of the residents. Cell phones are not a great way to contact us during the day as we don't always carry them in the hospital. Housing We do not provide housing and know that finding short -term housing can be difficult while an extern. To help with this process, we suggest you look on the site below for a variety of short -term housing options through the University of Minnesota. Please keep in mind that these listings have not been inspected or endorsed by the University of Minnesota. Many students have been very happy with some of these listings in the past. We recommend being within twenty minutes of the hospital (640 Jackson Street, St. Paul , MN ). Website: http//www.housing.umn.edu/offcampus/temp.shtml Page 4 of 11 Hospital/Rounds Rounds are done daily in the morning on inpatients. You may be assigned a patient to follow while in house and present to attending during rounds. Students should arrive a little before rounds to review patient's chart such as labs, vitals, and notes from the night before. Review the Foot & Ankle Inpatient Census sheet daily to review patients. Be sure to check cultures daily on infection patients, as residents and staff reply on students to be aware of culture results as they become available. On rounds, students should get the dressing supplies and participate in bandage removal and reapplication. Student s may also be asked to do full H&P's so you may want to keep your stethoscope with you. Surgery Surgery takes place at Regions Hospital or at the Same Day Surgery Center (4th floor, same building as clinic). Check with resident the day prior to confirm location. Both sites provide scrubs. You will participate in cases. Usually one student and one resident unless it is a big case. Student responsibilities : Drawing up local (usually 24cc of 0.5% marcaine plain), pulling up X -rays, applying the tourniquet , Mayo or digital blocks (ankle blocks typically done by resident). Pulling gloves for the resident scrubbing your case is helpful, but not expected. Just let them know either way. When multiple students are with the same attending for surgery, one student is scrubbing , while the other helps with patient prep. Try to be early on surgery days to \"pre- scrub\" so that you only have to use the waterless surgical scrub prior to the remaining cases .
