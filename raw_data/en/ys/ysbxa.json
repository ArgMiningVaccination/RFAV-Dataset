Like clockwork you are fighting against a situation that is a perfect storm for compromising your kid's immune system. Just the schedule change alone can stress the immune system, but you are also inviting so many more germs into your house. Like any battle (and any naturopathic-minded mom knows), prevention is the key. Here are 3 ways you can help boost your kid's immune system. Diet is always key to a good immune system. There are culprits that weaken your immune system. These include sugar and dairy products. The more sugar you eliminate, the better you are; this includes fruit juices and soda. If you absolutely must have juice, opt for adding a little bit of fresh fruit to some veggie juice instead. If already hit with an illness, dairy products tend to make your kid phlegmier and could increase congestion. Increase your greens, you are probably doing a great job, but bump up those servings of kale, broccoli, and cauliflower. Don't forget to bump up those high-quality proteins like beans, fish, and poultry as well. Your kids should be getting more than 8 hours of sleep. It is also important that they maintain regular bedtimes, even on the weekends. Additionally, it is important to limit those screen times before they go to bed. In the fall, the sun sets earlier and earlier and we spend less time outside. That's a huge loss of Vitamin D3 from the sun. Vitamin D3 is great for bone strength, but it also serves as an important way to help fend off winter viruses. What to do if they already caught a bug? The [Wet Sock Treatment](https://www.stellarhw.com/wet-sock-treatment-for-cold-and-flu/) is our go-to. We have talked about the Wet Sock Treatment before (see [Back to School Ka-Choo!](https://www.stellarhw.com/back-to-school-ka-choo/) and [7 Steps to Keep Momma Healthy](https://www.stellarhw.com/mom-down-7-steps-to-keep-momma-healthy/)), we stand by the Wet Sock Treatment for almost anytime you start to feel like you are going under. How does it work? Your body wants to keep itself at a constant temperature. When you soak in warm water for a while and then switch to a cold environment your body will send blood from the internal organs to your feet. In a nutshell, it increases blood circulation throughout the entire body. At Stellar Health and Wellness, all of our wellness professionals are focused on the individual.
