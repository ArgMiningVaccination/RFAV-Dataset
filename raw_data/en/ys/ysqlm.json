C. PAKISER, Denver, Colo. Work done in part under Advanced Research Projects Agency Order 193-64 Abstract.-Comparison of geothermal gradients, crustal struc\u00ad ture, and pressure-temperature relations for the basalt-eclogite transformation leads to the conclusion that the transformation zone may occur mainly within the crust in much of the Eastern United States and entirely within the mantle in much of the Western United States. The primitive crust that evolved from the mantle may have 'been silicic, later to have been made pro\u00ad gressively more mafic. The nature of the Mohorovicic discontinuity (M-dis\u00ad continuity) and its relation to the basalt-eclogite phase transfonnation have been subjects of much speculation and debate for many years. Wyllie (1963a, 1963b) summaLized the status of the debate and presented a con1promise based on the idea that the M -discontinuity represents the basalt-eclogite phase transformation in some pla.ees (for example, mountain beltts) and a chem\u00ad ical discontinuity between basalt and peridotite in others (for example, ocean basins and continental shields). Wyllie's compromise seems to have merit, but it is based in part on the idea that the ernst is thin in shields and other stable continental regions and relatively thick in orogenic belts and other active continental regions. Seismic-refraction studies have shown that in the ' conterminous lTnited States at least, the opposite is true: as a whole the crust is thick in stable continental regions and relatively thin in active continental regions (Tate] and Tuve, 1955 ~ Steinhart and Meyer, 1961; Pakiser, 1963 ~ Stuart and The tenns are in the dis\u00ad cussion that follows, and crustal thickness is identical with depth of theM-discontinuity below the surface of the earlt.h. In this paper, I will attempt to relate the crustal and upper-mantle structure in part of the Western United States to modern data from geochemistry and high-pressure rock physics: a proposed compositional model for the upper mantle (Ringwood, 1962a, 1962b), recent experimental data on the basalt-eclogite 1962; Ringwood and Green, 1964), and rock velocities under high pressures (Birch, 1961). Correlation of these data leads to the suggestion that the basalt-eclogite phase-transformation zone may be within the upper mantle where the crust is thin and \u00b7within the lower ernst and probably also within the upper n1antle where the crust is thick. This suggestion was developed through discussions and (or) correspond\u00ad ence with Jerry P. Eaton and John H. llealy, of the U.S. Geological Survey, Frank Press, of the California Institute of Technology, George A. Thompson, of Stan\u00ad ford University, and JohnS. Steinhart, of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. I am, of course, alone re\u00ad sponsible for any factual or interpretive errors that may be contained in this paper. PETROLOGIC AND GEOPHYSICAL EVIDENCE Ringwood (see also Clark and Ringwood, 1964) pro\u00ad posed a petrologic model for the upper mantle which is the equivalent of a mixture of about 4 parts peridotite and 1 part basalt. He called this rock \"pyrolite,\" of which there are high-pressure and low-pressure phases analogous to eclogite and basalt. and prin\u00ad peridotite\" Wyllie, mixture com\u00ad posed principally of peridotite and basalt. These two types of mantle rock are at least qualita\u00ad tively consistent with observed variations in the velocity of compressional waves in the upper mantle (Herrin U.S. GEOL. SURVEY PROF. PAPER The plagioclase in a basaltic fraction of the low-pressure phase would \u00b7tend to reduce the velocity, whereas the garnet in an eclogitic fraction of a high-pressure phase would have little effect on the velocity of a mixture in which perido\u00ad tite predominates. Ringwood ( 1962a) estimated the compressional-wave the mixture peridotite\u00ad eclogite to be 8.0 kilometers/second and for the mixture peridotite-basalt 7.8 km/sec. Seismic observations sug\u00ad gest that 8.2 km/sec may be the normal velocity for the upper-mantle rocks east of the Rocky Mountains and that 7.8 km/sec may be the normal velocity for the up\u00ad per-mantle rocks west of the Rocky Mountains. The velocity 8.2 km/sec would be appropriate for a mixture of peridotite and eclogite, and the velocity 7.8 km/sec would be appropriate for a mixture of peridotite and basalt. It is recognized, however, that factors other than change of phase-for example, elevated temperatures, changes in bulk composition including hydrous mineral assemblages, partial serpentinization of peridotite-may also influence velocity. The resulting uncertainties have been summarized recently by Boyd (1964). In particular, Boyd pointed out that rocks of basaltic com\u00ad position are quite commonly interstratified with kyanite schists metamorohic seauences. but phibolite rather than anhydrous gabbro or eclogite. This association implies water vapor pressure sufficiently high to mask the basalt-eclogite transition. If, there\u00ad fore, much water is present at great depths in the crust and in the upper mantle, t:\u00b7he transformation of basalt to eclogite might not take place at all. Approximate stability fields for basalt, eclogite, and liquid, together with the basalt-eclogite transformation and melting zones, were plotted (fig. 1) from data in J{ennedy (1959) and Boyd and England (1959) as sum\u00ad marized by Yoder and Tilley (1962), and from Ring\u00ad \u00b7wood and Green (1964). As discussed by Boyd (1964), the stability fields of basalt and eclogite have not yet been adequately determined, especially with regard to the width of the transition zone and its slope. The as\u00ad sumed geothermal gradients for the Basin and Range and Great Plains provinces are virtually the same as those assumed by Ringwood and Green for eastern and western Australia, respectively. Temperature at the M -discontinuity in the Great Plains (depth, 50 km) would be 525\u00b0C, and in the Basin and Range province (depth, 34 km) 590\u00b0C. Heat flow in the early Precam\u00ad brian shield of western Australia is about 1 microealorie per square centimeter per second, a rate probably about the same as that in the Great Plains; heat flow in moun\u00ad tainous eastern Australia is about 2 microcal/cm2/sec, LL.I 0 <( a:: 1200 (!) 1000 (.)

Geothermal gradients for the Basin and Range and Great Plains provinces are assumed. Sources of dlata on transformation zone: circle, Ringwood and Green ( 1964) ; square, Kennedy ( 1959) . a rate probably about the sa1ne as that in the Basin and Range province. Heat-flow determinations in the Western lTnited States are few, but the values above are consistent with the most recently available data (Roy, 1963). For the Basin and Range province, radiogenic heat production in a crust consisting of 221;2 km silicic rock and 11112 km mafic rock would be 1.0 microcal/cm2/sec. This determination is based on a heat production of 4 X 10-13 cal/cm3 /sec for silicic for mafic rock; both values are reasonable aver\u00ad ages. If heat flow from the mantle is 0.6 microcal/ em2/see, the total heat flow at the surfaee would be 1.6 mierocal/em2/see, whieh value is conservative for the province. This heat flow and a thermal conductivity of 6 X 10-3 cal/cm/sec/\u00b0C for crustal rocks (a reasonable average) would produce the geothermal gradient as\u00ad sumed for the Basin and Range province. The average heat production of crustal rocks for a 50-km crust in the 'Great Plains province can be no greater than 1.2 X 10-13 eal/cm3 /sec if the surface heat flow is 1.2 microcal/cm2/sec and the heat flow from the mantle is 0.6 microcal/cm2 /sec. This heat production is about that of average basalt, and is seemingly too low PAK.ISER B3 for a crust with a significant silicic fraetion. If heat flow from the mantle is significantly less than 0.6 micro\u00ad cal/ em 2 I sec, or if the total surface heat flow is greater than 1.2 microca1/cm2/see, heat production in the crust can be assumed to increase toward values appropriate for a more silicic crust. Surface heat flow of 1.2 micro\u00ad ealjem2/sec and a thermal conductivity of 8 X 10-s cal/ cm/sec/00 (a seemingly high estimate) would produce the geothermal gradient assumed for the Great Plains. For the geothermal gradient that is assumed for the Great Plains, basalt would be stable to a depth of 33 km; the basalt-eclogite transformation zone, if it exists, would extend to 54 km; and eclogite would be stable at greater depths (fig. 1). For the geothermal gradient assumed for the Basin and Range province, basalt would be stable to a depth of 40 km; the basalt-eclogite trans\u00ad formation zone, if it exists, would extend to 71 km; and eclogite would be stable at greater depths. The trans\u00ad formation zone under these conditions would, therefore, be mainly in the lower crust in the Great Plains, where crustal thickness is about 50 km, and entirely in the upper mantle in the Basin and Range province, where crustal thickness is a.bout 34 km. CRUSTAL STRUCTURE A crustal section extending from central Nevada to southeastern Nebraska was prepared (fig. 2) from a number of sources, summarized in part by Stuart and others ( 1964). The section is similar to that presented by Pakiser ( 1963) , except that the deep root under the Rocky Mountains has been moved eastward to a point near the Rocky Mountains-Great Plains border. Stein\u00ad hart and Meyer (1961, p. 338) stated that explosion\u00ad seismology results in western Montana \"indicate the surprising result that the crust is thinner in the North\u00ad ern Rocky Mountains than it is on the flanks of the Rockies.\" A similar result was obtained recently in the Middle Rocky Mountains of Idaho, Utah, and Wyoming by C. R. Willden, of the U.S. Geological Survey (writ\u00ad ten communication, 1964), and recordings along an un\u00ad reversed profile extending into the Southern Rocky Mountains from southeastern Colorado discussed by . ' Pak1ser, are interpreted to indic,ate that the ernst does not thieken mueh, if any, westward from the Great Plains. A preliminary interpretation by W. H . Jack\u00ad son, of the Geological Survey (written eommunication, 1964), of recordings of seismic waves along the highest part of the Southern Roeky Mountains north of Cli\u00ad max, Colo., indieates that the thickness of the erust is about the same there as it is in the Great Plains of eastern Colorado. Seismic evidenee supporting the separation of the erust into a silicic upper erust and a mafic lower crust is strong in the Basin and Range provinee and much of the intermontane plateaus, but is weak in the Great Plains. (.See Pakiser and Steinhart, 1964, for a discus\u00ad sion of the problem of the variation of velocity with depth.) All available evidence, however, indicates that compressional-wave velocity increases either continu\u00ad ously or discontinuously with depth at all places along the section of figure 2. The line separating the silicic upper crust from the mafic lower erust should not be taken as necessarily a discontinuity, but rather as a line that separates generally silicic rock (velocity 5.8-6.4 kmjsec) above the rock ( veloc\u00ad ity 6.6-7.6 km/sec) below. The depth interval appropriate for the basalt-eclogite transformation zone for the assumed Basin and Range and Great Plains geothermal gradients, when plotted on the crustal section, is wholly within the mantle under the Basin and Range province, crosses the M -discon\u00ad tinuity under the Colorado Plateau and Rocky Moun\u00ad tains, and is mainly in the lower crust in the Great Plains (fig. 2). The upper-mantle region suggested as consisting of peridotite and basalt (plagioclase pyrolite) and the suggested basalt-eclogite transformation zone under the intermontane plateaus is very similar to the upper-mantle region of low density and velocity in the Basin and Range provinee discussed by Pakiser ( 1963) . The geometric configuration of the suggested basalt\u00ad eclogite transformation zone in the crustal seetion seems to explain, at least qualitatively, the observed tion of crustal and upper-mantle velocities in the West\u00ad ern United States. If the geothermal gradient assumed for the Basin and Range province is approximately correct, a basaltic frac\u00ad tion of the upper-mantle rocks would begin to melt at a depth of about 100 km (fig. 1), which is consistent with the Gutenberg low-velocity channel in the upper mantle deduced from a shadow zone for body waves and the dispersion of surfaee waves (Gutenberg, 1959; Press, 1959). If the geothermal gradient in the Basin and Range province is a little steeper, and this may be so in local hot spots, the melting zone for the basaltic fraetion would merge with the basalt-eclogite transformation zone, and a melting zone for a silicic fraction of the crust might be developed. Sueh a phenomenon might explain the severe attenuation of seismic waves in the Basin and Range province. lT nder the Great Plains, the melting zone would presumably lie at great depths and a pronounced low-velocity channel would not be expected.

Velocities in the transformation zone interval, where within the mantle, were assumed to range linearly from 7.8 kin/sec (perido\u00ad tite and basalt) to 8.2 km/ sec (peridotite and eclogite). The M -discontinuity was assumed to be sharp. The silicic upper crust and mafic lower crust were assumed to be separated by a velocity transition zone 5 km deep. Representative velocity-depth models in the Basin and Range and Great Plains provinces based on these data and assumptions are plotted graphically (fig. 3). The Basin and Range velocity-depth model may be compared with the model of Roller and Healy ( 1963, fig. 10). Roller and Healy represented the silicic upper crust and mafic lower crust as separated by a sharp dis\u00ad continuity, but otherwise the two models are virtually the same. The Great Plains velocity-depth model may be compared with that for eastern Montana in Steinhart and Meyer (1961, fig. 9.15). Steinhart and Meyer rep\u00ad resented the crust by layers of uniform velocity, but otherwise the two models are virtually equivalent. The apparent failure of such a thick crust to produce high radiogenic heat suggests a crust even more mafic than that indicated by the velocity-depth model. High velocities in the deepest crust near those pre\u00ad dicted for the basalt-eclogite transformation zone (7.7 kmjsec on fig. 3) have been reported by several investi-PAKISER B5 BASIN AND RANGE Vp.

Steinhart and Meyer reported a veloc\u00ad ity of 7.58 km/sec for the lower 10 to 20 km of the crust in eastern Montana. McCamy and Meyer ( 1964) re\u00ad ported velocities as high 7.8 km/sec in eastern Mon\u00ad tana and 7.3 km/ sec in the thinner crust of the Arkansas\u00ad Missouri region. The trend in explosion-seismology re\u00ad search is toward detailed field experiments such as those using fixed arrays and moving shot points, and toward various array-processing techniques for phase identifi\u00ad cation, such as those reported by McCamy and Meyer (1964) and Ryall (1964}. Hopefully, these experi\u00ad ments will lead to more confident estimates of velocities in the lower crust. If velocities as high as 7.7 to 7.8 kmjsec. in the lower crust are substantiated, the problem of separating the lower crust from the upper mantle by the M-disconti\u00ad nuity may become rather arbitrary. However, in the area east of the Rocky Mountains, where velocities in the deep crust may be high, the upper-mantle velocity is high (greater than 8.0 km/sec), and in the area west of the Rocky Mountains, where velocities in the lower crust are generally significantly lower, velocities in the upper mantle are also low (typically 7.8 km/sec). Therefore, it is probable that a velocity contrast suffi\u00ad cient for detection exists at theM-discontinuity in all or most of the lT nited States, and that the M -discontinuity can be regarded as a chemical discontinuity separating crustal rocks of predominantly mafic composition from upper-mantle rocks of predominantly ultramafic composition. B6 GEOPHYSICS TECTONIC IMPLICATIONS Distinct differences in the seismic properties of the crust a~d upper mantle east and west of the Rocky Mountain System suggest that the conterminous lTnited St~tes is divided by the Rocky Mountains into two cru~tal and upper-mantle superprovinces (Pakiser and Stein!1art, 1964). In the eastern superprovince, the velocity of compressional waves in the upper-mantle rocks is everywhere greater than 8 km/sec the mean crustal velocity is generally greater than 6.4 kmjsec, and the crust is generally thicker than 40 km. In the wester-?- superprovince, the velocity of compressional waves In the upper-mantle rocks is everywhere less than 8 km/sec (except along the margin of the Pacific Ocean Basin), the mean crustal velocity is generally less than 6.4 kmjsec., and the crust is generally thinner than 40 km. T~ese are, of course, generalized averages, and there are Important regional variations within both superprovinces. For example, the mean erustal veloc\u00ad ity in the Coastal Plain (eastern superprovince) is less than 6.4 kmjsec because of the thick section of low\u00ad velocity sedimentary deposits; the root of the Sierra ~evada Mountains of California (western superprov\u00ad Ince) extends to a depth of more than 40 km, and the mafic lower crust in the Snake River Plain of Idaho (western superprovince) extends to, or very near to, the surface. Late Mesozoic and Cenozoic diastrophism plutonism d 1 . ' ' an vo canism have been widespread in the western superprovince, whereas the eastern superprovince has be.en_ relatively stable and quiescent during the past 100 million years or so. The crust and upper mantle in the we~te~ superprovince can be thought of as youth\u00ad ful-still In the process of evolution. The crust and upper mantle in the eastern superprovince can be thought of as rna ture. The crust of the west is now receiving mafic material from the mantle, whereas the crust of the east has already been extensively intruded with material froin the mantle. According to the foregoing analysis, the depth zone for the basalt-eclogite transformation is entirely within the upper mantle in the western superprovince, and the upper mantle there probably consists largely of the mixture peridotite-basalt overlying a zone extending from about 40 to 70 kin in which the basaltic fraction is gradually transformed to eclogite. The mantle prob\u00ad ably consists largely of the mixture peridotite-eclogite at greater depths. In the eastern superprovince, the depth zone for the basalt-eclogite transformation is mainly within the lower crust in areas of very thick crust, and the upper mantle there (except the upper\u00ad most part, which is in the transforination depth zone) probably consists largely of the mixture peridotite\u00ad ecl~gite. Thi~ relation has garnet pyrolite tD plagioclase pyrolite to have been accompanied by an increase of 3 percent in volume. This would have produced a vertical uplift of about % km for the model of figure 2 if the expansion were vertical only, and much less if the expansion were 2-or 3-dimensional, provided that the low-pressure peridotite-basalt phase formerly existed as the high\u00ad pressure peridotite-eclogite phase, which is by no means certain. For the sake of discussion, I will assume an expansion of 6 percent because of added thermal effects (including partial melting) and possibly also conver\u00ad sion of some peridotite to serpentine, as suggested by Hess (1955). This expansion and conversion would produce a maximum vertical uplift of 1 km. This up\u00ad lift is still seemingly not enough to account for the Late Cretaceous and more recent uplift in the western superprovince, which in many places exceeds 2 km. In the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Nevada, uplift exceeds 4 km. The western part of the Great Plains province, 'vhich is in the eastern superprovince, has been uplifted as much as 1 km since Late Cretaceous time, and the basalt-eclogite transformation seems totally inadequate to explain this uplift. Gilluly (1963) suggested that uplift of the Colorado Plateau could be explained by the \"subcrustal transfer of sial from other areas, perhaps the present area of the Basin Range province.\" Unless the upper-mantle zone of expansion is extended through a greater depth zone than that of figure 2, some such kinematic process involving, in my opinion, subcrustal and intracrustal transfer of molten basalt over a broader area seems necessary to explain the uplift of the mountains and high plateaus of the western superprovince and the maintenance of isostatic equilibrium. If the geothermal gradient in the Basin and Range province is as high or higher than that of figure 1, partial melting of a basaltic fraction of the upper mantle could provide a source for the Cenozoic basalt flows of the province. Partial melting of a silicic fraction of crustal rocks would require a much more severe geothermal gradient. Intrusive and extrusive silicic rocks of Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic times are widespread in the western su perprovince. SPECULATION CONCERNING CRUSTAL EVOLUTION The mean crustal velocity of the conterminous United States is less than what it would be if the average com-PAKISER B7 position of the crust were that of basalt (Pakiser and Steinhart, 1964), unless it is possible to break down basalt in such a way that the average velocity of large volumes of the separate co1nponents is substantially re\u00ad duced. The processes of weathering, transport of weathered materials, and their reconstitution as porous sedimentary deposits do produce rocks of substantially lower velocity than their source rocks, but the effect of porosity on seismic velocities is generally eliminated by pressure at depths greater than a few kilometers. The silicic upper crust constitutes n1ore than half the volume of the crust in much of the western superprovince, and a significant fraction of the crust in the eastern super\u00ad province (fig. 2). Therefore, the average composition of the continental crust is probably significantly more silicic than basaltic. If the crust of the eastern superprovince is, as was suggested, mature in the sense that it has already been extensively intruded with mafic material from the mantle, and the crust of the \"\\Vestern superprovince is youthful in the sense that it is now receiving mafic material from the mantle, then the crust has been be\u00ad coming increasingly more mafic with time. This proc\u00ad ess suggests that the primitive continental crust was sil\u00ad icic and that addition of mafic material from the mantle and removal of silicic material by erosion has made the crust progressively more 1nafic with time. This sug\u00ad gestion is supported by the higher mean crustal velocity of the rocks of the eastern superprovince, the iower heat flow, and the higher mean crustal density indicated by laboratory measurements of density and seismic velocity (Birch, 1961) and considerations of isostasy (Pakiser, 1963). Many thermal models indicate that the earth was getting progressively hotter during much of its history (MacDonald, 1963); this heat increase might have re\u00ad sulted in the early mobilization of low-melting and (or) water-soluble components in the upper mantle that, fol\u00ad lowing upward migration, may have been reconstituted as a primitive silicic crust. As the earth heated, a ba\u00ad saltic fraction could readily have been melted in the upper mantle and added, by intrusion and extrusion, to the primitive silicic continental crust, a process that may still be occurring in the western superprovince. A silica-enriched continental crust also could be explained either by the emplacement of the crust in one episode and the settling of an ultramafic fraction which became an addition to the upper mantle, or by a variety of kine\u00ad matic processes involving lateral and (or) vertical trans\u00ad fer of silicic and mafic material. Current geologic procesess and geologic history suggest, in any event, that crustal evolution is a continuing process. Localiza-tion of the continents may have been the result of com\u00ad positional inhomogeneities in the mantle of the primi\u00ad tive earth.

Abstract.-A gravity sur:vey of the San Luis Valley region of Colorado has revealed a closed gravity low that is interpreted as the expression of a middle Tertiary caldera. The suspected collapse caldera is centered near Bonanza, at the northeast cor\u00ad ner of the S:an Juan volcanic field. Available geologic and gravity evidence suggests that the structure has an elliptical outline with axes of 8 and 10 miles, and is filled with about 8.000 feet of low-density material. A regional gravity survey made in and around the San Luis Valley, Colo., during the summer of 1963 revealed a gravity low over volcanic rocks in the Bo\u00ad nanza mining district. Available geologic evidence supports an interpretation that the gravity low marks a caldera center. The Bonanza district lies at the northeast corner of the San Juan volcanic field, and at the north end of the San Luis Valley. Ths major tectonic unit with which these features is associated is the Rio Grande trough, a rift system that extends from the upper Ar\u00ad kansas Valley and San Luis Valley of Colorado, across New Mexico, and into northern Mexico. The Rio Grande trough is a complex graben, broken along its length into many separate en echelon basins. Middle Tertiary to Recent volcanism associated with the trough has resulted in many local accumulations of lava and pyroclastic rocks. The San Luis basin, which lies near the north end of the trough, is shown by recent unpublished gravity studies to be broken into a complex of buried en echelon horsts and grabens. Immediately to the west of the San Luis Valley lies the San Juan volcanic pile, one of several volcanic fields flanking the rift zone. Recogni\u00ad tion of caldera structures as volcanic sources in these fields has become fairly common. The Valles caldera has been recognized in the Jemez volcanic field in New Mexico (Smith and others, 1961). Other calderas in GEOLOGICAL SURVEY RESEARCH 1965 GEOPHYSICAL EVIDENCE OF A CALDERA AT BONANZA, COLORADO By DANIEL E. KARIG, Denver, Colo. Colorado have been described near Silverton and Lake City (Burbank, 1933 ; Luedke and Burbank, 1963) and Creede (Steven and Ratte, 1960; Steven and Ratte, 1963) in the San Juan Mountains. GEOLOGIC EVIDENCE Burbank ( 1932) described the Bonanza district as a volcanic dome and collapse structure. No detailed geo\u00ad logic study has been made of the district since the con\u00ad cept of caldera structures became well known. Ex\u00ad ploratory geologic work done by the Bear Creek Mining Co. (Cook, 1960) suggested a caldera structure, but 1napping was too local in extent to substantiate the idea. Volcanic rocks in the Bonanza area lie unconform\u00ad ably on a rugged topographic surface cut on older Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks and Precam\u00ad brian crystailine rocks. Larson and Cross (1956) dated the volcanic rocks as pre-Potosi (middle Mio\u00ad cene), but Cook ( 1960) considers them to be of Oligo\u00ad cene age and contemporaneous with the Silverton Volcanic Group of middle and late Tertiary age. A post-Oligocene Tertiary age is suggested by pollen analysis of specimens fron1 plant-rich lake beds found at the base of the volcanic rocks about 12 miles north\u00ad west of Bonanza (E. B.\u00b7 Leopold, written comn1unica\u00ad tion, 1964). The locality from which this pollen col\u00ad lection was taken has been assigned U.S. Geological Survey paleobotany locality No. D3343. The volcanic rocks range frmn andesite to rhyolite in composition, and have been estimated to be at least 5,000 feet thick (Burbank, 1932). If the gravity low marks a caldera, th~ underlying volcanic rocks could be much thicker. Reconnaissance geologic study, by the author, of the poorly mapped west flank of the Bonanza district dur\u00ad ing the gravity survey, combined with Burbank's (1932) and Cook's (1960) data, shows the following: U.S. SURVEY PROF. PAPER 525-B, PAGES B9-Bl2 B9 BlO GEOPHYSICS 1. Volcanic rocks on the flanks generally dip radially away from the center of the gravity low (fig. 1). 2. A circular belt of peaks, with an average diameter of about 7 miles, surrounds a topographic basin in the vicinity of the gravity lmv. Although this pattern resulted in part fron1 erosion, it may re\u00ad flect original structural relief. 3. Precambrian and Paleozoic rocks are exposed north, east, and south of the gravity low at altitudes substantially higher than the base of the volcanic rocks within the low. Considered with the out\u00ad ward dips on the outer flanks of the volcanic pile, this outcrop pattern suggests that the central area may be displaced downward, perhaps along faults between the Precambrian and volcanic rocks. Li1nited data indicate that such faults lie both inside and outside the ring of peaks. 4. The volcanic units inelude welded tuffs and lava flows. Certain of the more viscous, siliceous flow units (for example, Porphyry Peak Rhyolite and Hayden Peak Latite) are restricted to small areas on the margins of the gravity low, and are sug\u00ad gestive of peripheral volcanic accumulations around the margin of a collapsed area. G'RAVITY EVIDENCE About 50 gravity stations were established in and immediately adjacent to the Bonanza district. Most of them were located at bench marks and spot eleva\u00ad tions; however, lac.k of vertical control west and south of Bonanza made necessary the use of altimeters for the determination of altitude at 15 percent of the sta\u00ad tions. Gravity readings were reduced to the Bouguer anomaly, on the basis of a slab density of 2.67 g/cm3 Topographic corrections were applied for a radial dis\u00ad tance of about 18 miles from the stations. The Bonanza gravity low, as defined by the -286- milligal contour (fig. 1), is subcircular with a definite northwest elongation. It has at least 12 mgal of closure. Gravity relief, relative to the low,. ranges from more than 70 mgal on the south to slightly more than 20 mgal on the east. The most negative Bouguer-anomaly value measured in the Bonanza district is -296 mgal, and the steepest gradient bounding the low is about 10 mgal/mile. The area enclosed by the -286 mgal con\u00ad tour is broken into a series of north-northwest-trending highs and lows with amplitudes of 4 to 6 mgal. Rela.\u00ad tively large gravity highs bound the Bonanza \u00b7low on the north and south, and a gravity ridge flanks it on the east. The gravity field to the west has not been mapped. Detailed quantitaJtive analysis of the Bonanza low is difficult because of the 1nany variables involved. How-ever, an approximate interpretation can be made by as\u00ad suming that the top of the anomalous mass is at the ground surface, and that the significant density con\u00b7 trast is between the low-density fill and the Precambrian rocks. Cook ( 1960) has reported that the Precambrian rocks, most of which are biotite granite gneiss, have an average density of 2.70 g/cm3 The volcanic rocks range in density from 2.00 to 2.62 g/cm3 depending on lithology and degree of alteration. An average density of 2.50 g/cm3 was assigned to the volcanic rocks and also to the Paleozoic strata. This gives a density con\u00ad trast of 0.20 g/cm3 between the low-density fill and the surrounding Precambrian rocks. A solid-angle graticule (Lachenbruch, 1957) was used to compute the theoretical gravity anomaly pro\u00ad duced by a three-dimensional mass distribution chosen to approximate the proposed Bonanza caldera.. This mass distribution was altered until its computed anom\u00ad aly agreed with the observed anomaly. A distribution that satisfies the observed anomaly is an elliptical cylin\u00ad der centered about 2 miles northwest of Bonanza with a maximum radius of about 5 miles trending northwest and a minimum radius of about 4 miles. This model can be regarded as an elliptical structure filled with materials less dense than the surrounding Precambrian rocks. Figure 2 shows a vertical section through this mass distribution. If the density contrast is 0.20 g/cm3, the low-density fill would be about 8,000 feet thick. Small changes in the density contrast result in relatively large changes in the thickness of low-density material required to produce the observed anomaly ; a contrast of 0.10 g/cm3 would require a low-density material thick\u00ad ness of only 4,000 feet. The measured thickness of the volcanic rocks exposed in fault blocks (Burbank, 1932) is 5,000 feet, which suggests that a depth of 8,000 feet is reasonable. Low-amplitude anomalies enclosed by the -286-mgal contour may be explained as the expression of horsts and grabens which result frmn post-subsidence doming (Smith and others, 1961). The pattern suggests that a second series of ring faults might lie within the ring of peaks at a radius of about 3 miles. The area within this ring appears to be a dome with a bisecting central graben trending nearly parallel to the long axis o\u00a3 the caldera. CONCLUSIONS Although the accumulated geologic evidence does not conclusively demonstrate that the volcanic center at Bonanza is a caldera, it does, when augmented by grav\u00ad ity evidence, support such an interpretation.

Abstract.-Six hundred and seventy-three earthquakes of magnitudes 2.0 to 5.3 were recorded and located beneath the Hawaiian Ridge during 1963. The Kaoiki fault system, the Kalapana Trail region, the east rift zone of Kilauea, and a zone 30 km beneath Kilauea Caldera were regions of concentrated earthquake activitiy. This report extends the coverage of \"Hawaiian Seis\u00ad mic Events during 1962\" (Koyanagi, 1964) and com\u00ad plements Summaries 29-32 of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory for 1963 (Koyanagi and others, 1964a, 1964b; Krivoy and others, 1964; Okamura and others, 1964). Methods and limitations of epicenter loca\u00ad tions were similar to those described in the report of 1962 events. To facilitate comparison of events the or\u00ad ganization of that report has been retained. Figure 1 shows the geologic features and volcanic systems of the island of Hawaii. The earthquakes plotted were those of magnitude 2.0 and greater which were recorded on the Hawaiian Vol\u00ad cano Observatory seismic net and located along the Hawaiian Ridge within the geographical coordinates lat 18\u00b0-23\u00b0 N. and long 154\u00b0-161\u00b0 W. The thorough\u00ad ness of our interpretation depended in large part on the degree of concentration of seismic activity. Thus, the May 9-12, July 1-5, and August 3-5 seismic crises; the August 21-23 and October 5-6 Kilauea flank eruptions; and the August 26, September 21, and October 23 Kaoiki fault earthquake series were periods of such intense seismic activity that the arrival times of some earth\u00ad quake phases were difficult to determine. CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS IN 1963 A swarm of about 150 earthquakes occurred 30 kilo\u00ad meters beneath the summit of Kilauea during Januar-y 8-9. The largest of these (magnitudes 4.3 and 4.2) occurred on January 8 and were felt throughout the island. Magnitudes of the others ranged clown to less than 1.

The second quarter (fig. 2) was characterized by the seismic crisis of May 9-12. Thousands of small, shal\u00ad low earthquakes occurred along the 10-km-long east\u00ad trending Koae fault system immediately south of Ki\u00ad lauea Caldera. Although several quakes were felt in the Kilauea summit region during this episode, most of them were less than magnitude 2. Cracking of the ground was observed in the epicentral zone, and a moderate collapse of the Kilauea summit was indicated by tiltmeter readings. 160\" 155\u00b0 Upolu Point FIGURE 1.-Map of the island of Hawaii, showing geologic features.

Geographic names are shown on figure 1. The number of earthquakes in the upper east rift and including the adjacent Koae fault system was difficult to determine accurately during the May 9-12, July 1-5, and August 3-5 seismic crises, and the August 21-23 Kilauea east rift eruption because of the complexity of the seismograms. The cumulative activity of the following five events distinguished the third quarter (fig. 3) as the most active period of the year seismically: ( 1) July earthquakes series; and ( 5) Septem\u00ad ber 21, Kaoiki earthquake series. The July 1-5 collapse of the Kilauea summit was ac\u00ad companied by many small, shallow earthquakes and resulted in the cracking of the ground along the upper east rift zone of Kilauea. Collapse of the Kilauea sum\u00ad mit was indicated by tiltmeter readings. The August 3-5 seismic episode consisted of 2 hours of strong seismic activity along Kilauea's upper east rift zone, much like the event of July 1-5 but of shorter duration. It was followed by a flurry of Ki\u00ad lauea quakes at a depth of 30 km. The August 21-23 eruption on the east rift of Kilauea was marked by small, shallow earthquakes, and har-monic tremor was recorded throughout the eruptive pe\u00ad riod. Collapse of the Kilauea summit was indicated by tiltmeter readings. On August 26 an earthquake of magnitude 4.9 oc\u00ad curred at a shallow depth along the Kaoiki fault system. It was followed by hundreds of small aftershocks in the next several days. On September 21 there was another earthquake, of magnitude 4.8, along the Kaoiki fault system, which also was followed by hundreds of small aftershocks. The most significant event during the fourth quarter (fig. 3) was the October 5-6 eruption on the east rift zone of Kilauea. It was characterized by small, shal\u00ad low earthquakes, harmonic tremor, and collapse of the Kilauea summit. On October 23 an earthquake of magnitude 5.3 occurred at a shallow depth along the Kaoiki fault system; it was followed by several hundred small aftershocks.

The number of earthquakes in the upper east rift during the October eruption on the east rift of Kilauea was difficult to determine accurately because of the complexity of the seismograms. SUMMARY Earthquakes in Hawaii during 1963 were most nu\u00ad merous on the southeast end of the Hawaiian Ridge, mostly on the island of Hawaii (fig. 4). As documented for the period April 1958 to September 1959 (Eaton, 1962) and for 1962 (Koyanagi, 1964), seismic activity was greatest near and beneath the two active volcanic systems, Kilauea and Mauna Loa, and less Mauna Kea, Hualalai, and Kohala (fig. 5). Of the earthquakes of magnitude 2 and greater which were recorded and located in 1963,4 7 percent were beneath Kilauea, 29 percent beneath Mauna Loa, 6 per\u00ad cent beneath Mauna Kea, 1 percent beneath Hualalai, 1 percent beneath Kohala, and the remaining 16 percent were offshore. Seventy-six percent of the earthquakes occurred beneath the active volcanic systems of Kilauea :tnd Mauna Loa. Most of the recorded quakes were smaller than 2 in magnitude; of tha,t group, most were less than 1. Many of these took place at shallow depths beneath Kilauea Caldera, where earthquake counts of hundreds per day were not uncommon. Both of the outbreaks on the flank of Kilauea in 1963 were characterized by several hours of shallow but in\u00ad tense pre-eruption seismic activity in the summit region, harmonic tremor for the duration of the eruptive period, and marked deflation of the summit. Focal depths of earthquakes ranged from near surface to 45 kilometers. With the exception of earth\u00ad quakes that occurred in the highly seismic zone 30 kilo\u00ad meters beneath the Kilauea Caldera region, most earth\u00ad quakes had focal depths of less than 15 kilometers.

[In press] GEOLOGICAL SURVEY RESEARCH 1965 CORRELATION OF ZINC ABUNDANCE WITH STRATIGRAPHIC THICKNESS VARIATIONS IN THE KINGSPORT FORMATION, WEST NEW MARKET AREA, MASCOT-JEFFERSON CITY MINING DISTRICT, TENNESSEE By HELMUTH WEDOW, JR., and JAMES R. MARIE, Knoxville, Tenn., Alexandria, La. Ab8tract.-The stra'tigraphic thiclmess of the upper dolomite member of the Kingsport Formation varies inversely with that of the lower limestone member of the Kingsport at the rate of about 1 :-3 in the vVest New Market area. Zinc abundance co\u00ad efficients of the Kingsport , as calculated from drill-hole assay data, vary directly but logarithmi cally with the inverse thick\u00ad ness relation. Ten-fold increments occur in the abundance co\u00ad efficients for changes of +42 feet and -25 feet in the respective thicknesses of the upper and lower members. These numerical relations suggest that a fracture porosity, created by collapse dilatation of the upper dolomite member where the lower mem\u00ad ber had been thinned by solution removal of limestone, became clogged by deposits from migrating zinc-bearing fluids. The West New Market area lies in the heart of the Mascot-Jefferson City mining district, Tennessee (fig. 1) . Large reserves of zinc ore were discovered in this area during the 1950's by the American Zinc Co. of Tennessee (Oder, 1958), with government assistance through a loan supplied by the Defense Minerals Explo\u00ad ration Administration of the U.S. Department of the Interior. In 1960, Tri-State Zinc, Inc., conducted ad\u00ad ditional drilling in the West New Market area in ad\u00ad vance of its joint venture with American Zinc to de\u00ad velop part of the West New Market ores. The wealth of data gained as a result of these exploration drilling pro\u00ad grams is so immense that it is ttlmost unwieldy. Ac\u00ad cordingly, the U.S. Geological Suney has in progress a project to reduce some of these data, as well as some from other exploration programs in the East Tennessee zinc districts, to more manageable and comprehensible form through the application of rnn,thematical and sta\u00ad tistical techniques. The present paper is a preliminary report on several of the more significant statistical pat\u00ad terns that have emerged in the course of developing electronic-computer programs to handle the multiplicity of data a.nd calculations. The authors wish to thank the American Zinc Co. of Tennessee and theN ew Market Zinc Co. for permission to use selected drilling data from the West New Market area for this statistical analysis. Initial study of the West New Market drill logs, struc\u00ad ture sections, and isochore maps indicated qualitatively that the host Kingsport Formation 1 of the Lower Or\u00ad dovician part of the Knox Group is thinner where pen\u00ad etrated by ore and shine holes than where penetrated by trace and barren holes. 2 The local thinning of the Kingsport appears to be due to the thinning of its lower limestone member; the upper fine-grained dolomite member has a tendency to thicken concomitantly, but not sufficiently for complete compensation. This quali\u00ad tative relation is exemplified by the cross section of fig\u00ad ure 1. In the 20 drill holes of this section, mean thick\u00ad nesses of the lower and upper members are 82.1 and 175.4 feet, respectively. If the 20 holes are divided into two groups: barren and trace holes on the one hand, and shine and ore holes on the other, the resulting mean thickness for each member in each group (see table 1) clearly indicates that zinc is in greater abundance in areas where the lower member thins and the upper member thickens. ' In this paper the Kingsport Formation Is considered to be the strata subtended by horizons G-192 above and G-(-) 62 below; the G-28 horizon marks the division of the formation Into the upper dolomite and lower limestone members (Oder and 1\\Iiller, 1945, table 2; Oder and Hicketts , 1961, pl. 1). The lower limestone member is also con\u00ad sidered to be the equivalent of the \"R\" and \"S\" beds of Crawford (1945, p. 413, 414, and fig. 1) in the Jefferson City area. \"An ore hole Is one which has cut at least one Interval of zinc-bearing material of minable grade and thickhess. A shine hole shows strongly mineralized rock but contains no minable interval attaining ore grade. A trace hole is but weakly mineralized with a few scattered traces (specks) of sphalerite. Barren Is used to designate a hole in which no sphalerite was noted during normal visuul core logging and, thus, was not studied in greater detail nor assayed chemically ; doubtless , a more thorough study of the \"barren\" core, particularly with optical aids, would have upgraded some of the barren holes to the trace category.

Strati\u00ad graphic thickness data were derived by correcting drill\u00ad hole penetration thickness for dip, although as most dips in this area are less than10\u00b0 this correction is rela\u00ad tively insignificant and does not appreciably modify the statistics. Quantity of zinc in the Kingsport For\u00ad mation in each drill hole is expressed numerically by a zinc abundance coefficient.3 Both thickness data and zinc abundance coefficients were rounded to the nearest whole number, except for the low coefficients of less than 0.5 but more than zero, which were upgraded to unity. The data thus derived comprise four variables for each drill hole : the stratigraphic thicknesses (in feet) of (1) the Kingsport Formation and its (2) lower limestone and (3) upper dolomite members, and (4) the zinc abundance coefficient for the total Kingsport; for convenience these variables are designated TK, Ll{, UK and ZAOtk respectively. Table 2 presents there- ' ' . bl spective \u00b7 frequency distributions of the varia .es. Means sample standard deviations ( s), and the relative measu~s of skewness, a3, based on the third moment about the mean (Croxton and Cowden, 1955, p. 229- 232), are also listed in table 2. The univariate distri\u00ad butions of LK, UK, TK, and log ZAOtk are also shown by histograms on figure 2. Chi-square values (to show a Zinc abundance coefficients (ZAG) are calculated by summing the foot-percent (that is, the length of the assay run, in feet, times the zinc content, in percent) values of all chemical assays in the tot~l thickness interval of the stratigraphic unit for which a .coefficient. IS desired, in this case the Kingsport Formation. The semiquantitative visual designations of \"shine'' and \"trace,\" which are not assayed chem\u00ad ically in normal company practice, are each given the arbit:ary low foot-percent values of 0.4 and 0.2, respectively. In the few mstances where chemical assays of weakly mineralized runs were not made, the original visually estimated grades are used directly. An example of the calculation of ZAG for a hypothetical drill hole follows: Depth coefficient (ZAG) ___ ----------------------------------Foot-percent values 0.2 .2 .4 22.4 16.5 1.5 41.2 It is immediately apparent from the above that the low zinc abundance coefficients are based primarily on estimated values, whereas high co\u00ad efficients are dominated by the li:io.re precise chemical assays. \"goodness-of-fit\" to normal distributions with the same means and standard deviations) and the calculated nor\u00ad mal curves are also given with the histograms. The statistics show that although the frequencies of TK can be considered to approxilnate a normal distri\u00ad bution, the distributions of LK and UK are nowhere near normal. The distribution of LK is bimodal and appears to be somewhat left skewed, whereas that of UK has but a single mode and is strongly right skewed. The combination of the thicknesses of the two members into that for the total fonnation ( TK) tends to cancel out the opposing skewnesses, so as to develop a more normal distribution, although a hint of the slightly left skewed bimodal character of LK is retained. The distribution of ZA 0 tk (table 2) is clearly the least normal of the variables considered herein. It is extremely right skewed (as= + 2.13) and is thus p:ob\u00ad ably log-normal. Consequently, log transformatiOns of the ZA 0 tk values were used for fu'rther study of the variation of zinc abundance and its relation to vari\u00ad ations in the stratigraphic thickness of the members of the Kingsport Formation (see log ZAOtk, ta?le 2). The distribution of log ZAOtk is distinctly different from ZAOn\u00b7, having two strong modes and a much lower skewness coefficient. The chi-square value (fig. 2) shows that it is less normal than_any of ~he thick~ess variables considered above. The ImpressiOn of right skewness, in spite of a relatively low value for as, is caused by arbitrarily cramming all z~ro values of ZAOtk into the lowest log class interval (1.5-0.0). The frequency distribution of ZAOtk is probably a~ut equally divided into two log-normal subpopulatwns with high and low mean 4 abundance coefficients of less than 1 aud about 70, respectively. If these distribu\u00ad tions are log-nonnal, it can be reasoned that the \"bar\u00ad ren\" holes contain slight traces of sphalerite which are below the threshold of \"measurement\" in visual core logging. Obviously, actual chemical data, from which the lower values of the abundance coefficients can be calculated precisely, will be necessary for a better un\u00ad derstanding of univariate distribution of this variable. The inverse correlation of UK with LK, suggested by the opposing skewnesses of their univariate distribu\u00ad tions and bv the approach to normalcy when they are summed into the distribution of T K, is clearly seen in their bivariate frequency distribution (fig. 3). The standard statistical test for correlation by the product moment method yields an rxy coefficient of -0.42. This value is considered highly significant, as the critical value of rxy for significance at the 1-percent level is 0.21 ' Geometric mean, that is, the antilog of the arithmetic mean of the log values.

It is concluded from the foregoing statistics derived from the drilling data in theW est New Market area that within the limits of the data the upper dolomite member of the Kingsport Formation thickens about a third of a foot for every foot of thinning in the lower limestone member. Furthermore, there is a 10-fold increase in zinc abundance, as compiled from assay data, for every 25 feet of thinning of the lower member and for every 42 feet of thickening of the upper member. It is con\u00ad jectured that, during the development of an extensive karst terrane on the J{nox Group in early Middle Or\u00ad dovician time (Wedow, 1961; Hoagland and others, 1964), stresses were created in the upper dolomite mem\u00ad ber of the Kingsport Formation by the solution removal of limestone from the lower member. Such stresses were relieved concomitantly by sag, rupture, and col\u00ad lapse, vertically dilating the upper member (Wedow and Marie, 1964). As this increase in the thickness of the upper mmnber is not sufficient to compensate com\u00ad pletely for the thinning of the lower member, further evidence of dilatancy and accompanying mineralized breccias may be anticipated in the overlying Mascot Dolomite. Correlation of zinc abundance with the in\u00ad verse relation between the thicknesses of the two mem\u00ad bers of the J{ingsport can follow, where the fracture porosity created by collapse dilatation has been lessened or destroyed by the cementing effect of deposits from migrating zinc-bearing fluids.

GEOLOGICAL SURVEY 'RESEARCH 1965 MERCURY-BEARING ANTIMONY DEPOSIT BETWEEN BIG CREEK AND YELLOW PINE, CENTRAL IDAHO By B. F. LEONARD, Denver, Colo. A.bstract.-A stibnite deposit accidentally found in the spring of 1964 contains appreciable cinnabar. The mercury content of selected samples is 0.5-5 percent. The ore is in a sheared, silici\u00ad fied zone in granodiorite cut by Miocene(?) dikes. Mercury was not previously known from central Idaho mineral deposits ha v\u00ad ing this geologic setting. The discovery of this workable ore body refocuses attention on the mineral potential of extensive silicified zones in the region. Mercury was discovered in an antimony deposit in the Big Creek mining district in September 1964. The anti\u00ad mony deposit itself had been found only a few months before, when high-grade stibnite was accidentally un\u00ad covered on the B and B claims by Ray Nissula while bulldozing an access road to other claims in the Profile Summit area. The stibnite find was partly explored by stripping, and by late summer a modest tonnage of an\u00ad timony ore had been trucked to a custom mill at Yellow Pine for treatment. Later in September, the operator found that \"red mud\" from overburden at the southwest end of the workings contained mercury (Ray Nissula, 1964, oral communication). Independently and almost simultaneously, cinnabar was identified by the U.S. Geo\u00ad logical Survey from specimens of the antimony ore. No reliable estimate of the expectable size or average _grade of the deposit could be made from the sparse data available when I examined the property in Sep\u00ad tember. However, the showing was of considerable promise, considering the accessibility of the deposit, presence of a mill at Yell ow Pine, and current local price of 38 cents per pound of contained antimony. The pres\u00ad ence of mercury in the ore, not known at the time of my examination, September 4, 1964, should enhance its value considerably if both mercury and antimony can be satisfactorily recovered. The following preliminary account, based on observa\u00ad tions made on the above date is presented because (1) the cinnabar-bearing stibnite deposit itself is of imme\u00ad diate economic interest, ( 2) mercury has not previously been reported from the Big Creek district, and (3) an intimate association of stibnite and cinnabar, said to be common in nondomestic deposits of this character, is rare in the adjoining Yellow Pine district, which has been a major producer both of antimony and of mercury from discrete deposits containing those metals. The cinnabar-bearing stibnite deposit on the B and B claims is the only new body of antimony ore to be ex\u00ad ploited in the Big Creek-Yellow Pine area in 20 years, and the first find of mercury ore outside the narrow limits of the Cinnabar-Fern area of the Yellow Pine district. LOCATION The B and B group of unpatented claims is northeast of Profile Summit, the pass crossed by the graded forest road from Yellow Pine to Big Creek, Valley County, Idaho. The mercury-antimony deposit described in this report is on the B and B No. 4 claim, 1.1 miles by road from Profile Summit toward Big Creek, at elevation 7,270 feet, NW1;4NW1;4 sec. 19, T. 20 N., R. 9 E., in Payette National Forest. An access road 250 feet long extends from the graded road to the prospect. The topographic map for the are~a is the Big Creek 15-minute quadrangle, scale 1 : 62,500. The B and B claims are held by Frank Callender and Ray Nissula, Cascade, Idaho. The antimony deposit is being worked by Ray Nissula. Access to this mountainous area is relatively good for central Idaho. Profile Summit is open to traffic from June to November, and the rest of the forest road is open longer. The road distance from Yell ow Pine to the prospect is about 15 miles, and from Big Creek settle\u00ad ment about 8 miles. Both settlements are served by graded roads maintained by the U.S. Forest Service and airstrips maintained by the Idaho Department of Aeronautics. McCall and Cascade are the nearest vil\u00ad lages served by highway and railroad. U.S. GEOL. SURVEY PAPER 525-B, PAGES GEOLOGIC is in a major syste1n of silicified zones that accompanies the Profile dike swarm near the heart of the Idaho bath\u00ad olith. The Profile swarm, shown on figure 3 of Shenon and Ross (1936, following p. 12), is part of a larger swarm that extends northward for 11 miles through the Big Creek quadrangle from Middle Lake to the head of the north fork of Smith Creek. (To locate the B and B deposit on Shenon and Ross' figure 3, plot a point 200 feet south west of the old prospect shown at the road edge, on the contact between \"moraine\" and \"Idaho batholith,\" 2,500 feet northeast of Profile Sum\u00ad mit, the \"Profile Gap\" of their map.) Most of the dikes are granitic porphyries. Because similar cene, and Miocene ( ~) age, they are thought to be approximately of Miocene age. In the Profile Sum\u00ad mit area, the silicified zones are mainly in a slightly contaminated facies of felsic granodiorite of the Idaho batholith. These silicified zones are replacements, fissure fillings, and stockworks within a mylonitized, sheared, and brecciated belt of granodiorite. At the un\u00ad developed Red Bluffs scheelite-huebnerite deposit, the sheared part of the silicified material is pre-dike in age, while the undeformed quartz, scheelite, huebnerite, and accessory sulfides of copper, lead, and zinc are either syn-or more likely post-dike. The ore-quartz relations may be similar at the mercury-antimony de\u00ad posit on the B and B claims, since both deposits occur in the same dike swarm and scattered stibnite prospects, some of them close to scheelite prospects, are present in similar though not continuous silicified zones near Yellow Pine and Big Creek settlements. However, the relation of the newly discovered cinnabar-stibnite de\u00ad posit to nearby showings of stibnite and scheelite, such as those reported by Shenon from the present Syringa and adjoining Glasgow claims ( Shenon and Ross, 1936, p. 24) , is still to be determined. The geologic setting of the B and B deposit is similar in its essential features to that of the antimony-gold\u00ad tungsten deposit at the Yellow Pine mine at Stibnite described by White (1940) and Cooper (1951), but dif\u00ad ferent from that of the mercury deposits at the Hermes (Cinnabar) and Fern mines described by Larsen and Livingston (1920), Ross (Schrader and Ross, 1926, p. 156-163), and Bradley (1943). In the Stibnite-Cinna\u00ad bar area, the minerals stibnite and cinnabar have been found together only at the Sugar Creek prospect (Cooper, 1951, p. 188). Cooper's observation has sub\u00ad sequently been confirmed by Ernest Oberbillig ( 1963, oral communication), a mining engineer familiar with the antimony and mercury deposits of the region. The discovery of mercury and antimony ore on the B and B claims reemphasizes the mineral potential of the extensive shear zones in the Big Creek and Yell ow Pine districts and should stimulate prospecting for simi\u00ad lar deposits in this environment. STRUCTURE The B and B cinnabar-bearing stibnite deposit is in a sheeted quartz \"vein\" that strikes N. 30\u00b0-40\u00b0 E. and dips perhaps 75\u00b0-80\u00b0 SE. On September 4, ore was in\u00ad termittently exposed for a length of 40 feet. The south\u00ad west end was covered by mud washed in from the low bench above; the northeast end was still concealed be\u00ad neath undisturbed colluvial and glacial debris. The single good exposure across the vein showed a width of 5 feet of ore. The height between the 2 exploratory benches was 8-10 feet. The estimated grade of the ore was 14 percent stibnite by volume, equivalent to about 15 percent antimony by weight. The mercury content was unknown. Several factors that affect the apparent attitude and dimensions of the exposed ore body are discussed below. The strike, based on intermittent exposures, is obvi\u00ad ous; the dip is not. Subparallel stibnite veinlets within the sheeted quartz vein strike N. 35\u00b0-40\u00b0 E. and dip 75\u00b0-80\u00b0 SE. The hanging wall of ore exposed on September 4 was a scaly surface striking N. 30\u00b0 E. and dipping 55\u00b0-80\u00b0 SE. For want of better information the inferred attitude of the ore body is therefore N. 30\u00b0- 400 E., 75\u00b0-80\u00b0 SE., perhaps dipping more gently in places. The hanging wall exposed on September 4 was a sur\u00ad face only, about to be tested in the third dimension by drilling. The area to the southeast was muck covered. The position of the footwall is somewhat better known. Intermittent exposures on the bench floor northwest of the ore body showed a 28-foot width of vein quartz, locally with coarse muscovite and perhaps a little relict granodiorite. This quartz contained disseminated py\u00ad rite specks but only a few very small knots of stibnite. Farther west the bench was muck covered. Two features suggest that the ore body might be a plunging shoot within the silicified zone. The hanging wall exposed on September 4 showed striae generally raking 15\u00b0-20\u00b0 NE., but locally steeper; the striae are nearly parallel to the trace of a set of coarse, gently dipping joints. Groups of stibnite veinlets within the quartz vein seemed to form pods raking about 70\u00b0 NE. This scanty information is enough to suggest that the hypothesis of shoot structure should be kept in mind as exploration advances. Shoots plunging about 30\u00b0 N. were present in gold-antimony ore at the Meadow Creek and Yellow Pine mines near Stibnite (Cooper, 1951, p. LEONARD B25 182 and pl. 44; pl. 42, section A -A'), and mercury ore at the Hermes mine may have been confined to a gently plunging shoot (Bradley, 1943, p. 41-42). The pres\u00ad ence of shoot structure in these neighboring ore bodies mnphasizes the possibility of there being a similar dis\u00ad position of ore at the Band B deposit. Possible right-lateral offset and repetition of the ore body by faulting is suggested by scale structure accom\u00ad panying the striae on the apparent hanging wall of the exposed ore. The steps of the scales or flakes indicate that relative movement along this surface was west side north and down. If the apparent hanging wall is the true hanging wall, and if significant 1novement occurred along that surface after deposition of the stibnite, one might be prompted to seek a ruptured part of the stib\u00ad nite body-in effect, a new ore body-southwest of the present exposure and on the southeast side of the pro\u00ad jected hanging-wall surface. The amount of possible right-lateral offset cannot be predicted from the data at hand; consequently, prospecting for an inferred repeti\u00ad tion of the known ore body would be somewhat hazardous. MINERALOGY The principal ore mineral is stibnite. Associated metallic minerals-all relatively sparse, fine ) The last three are too sparse to warrant further com\u00ad ment in this report. Quartz is the chief gangue min\u00ad eral; several generations are present. Barite is com\u00ad mon in cinnibar-bearing specimens. Purple sericite is rare. Alteration products are mainly orange, yellow, green, and white antimony oxides, locally accompanied by limonite, scorodite ( ? ) , minute crystals of quartz, and a bit of white clay. These secondary minerals were con\u00ad spicuous, though quantitatively negligible, in ore piled for shipment; they were sparse at the mine face. Pre\u00ad sumably they are largely or wholly supergene. Uniden\u00ad tified powdery black material is present locally; it may be an antimony oxide. Its status as a secondary min\u00ad eral is doubtful. Secondary mercury minerals, if pres\u00ad ent, have not been recognized. Stibnite, mostly fine grained but in part coarsely bladed and locally vuggy, forms patches, veinlets, and irregular masses in quartz. The larger veinlets are one\u00ad half inch to several inches thick and a few feet long, subparallel to the vague sheeting in the quartz host and scattered at close intervals throughout it, possibly as plunging podlike ( ? ) bodies. ~{uch of the stibnite is a replacement of quartz, but some small veinlets are fissure fillings. Other veinlets show a combination of these features, one wall being sharply defined and unreplaced, each projection of the wall corresponding to an inden-tation in the stibnite, the other wall being fuzzy and bordered with islands of quartz in stibnite. A little stibnite occurs as small clots of finely disseminated grains, or as clusters of prisms a few millimeters long. One specimen shows thicker stibnite veinlets slightly displaced by an oblique fracture along which barite and second-generation stibnite have been introduced, largely as a replacement of the quartz host. Cinnabar, the common form of mercury sulfide, oc\u00ad curs sporadically in stibnite and quartz as groups of discrete granules, as patches of coalescing granules, and as coatings of very sn1all crystals. Each granule and crystal is a millimeter or less in diameter (less than l!J.6 inch). Once identified, the mineral is easily recog\u00ad nized by its red color and finely granular habit. Even where sparse, it is conspicuous in association with quartz or orange and yellow antimony oxides, but it is rec.<tdily overlooked in massive stibnite, where it may be undetected until the specimen is cut by a rock saw. Cinnabar replaces both quartz and stibnite, and some thin veinlets of second ( ? stibnite are cut by hairlike veinlets cinnabar. In all specimens showing a quartz-stibnite contact, cinnabar is close to the contact and concentrated in either the quartz or the stibnite. Commonly cinnabar is accompanied by me\u00ad dium-grained barite and by minute pyrite cubes. One specimen shows sparse crystals of cinnabar deposited on stibnite in a narrow, vuggy space between a barite vein and the gray quartz host. Part of this quartz has been brecciated and then cemented by the barite. The quantity of cinnabar in the ore is difficult to estimate because of fine grain size and spotty distribu\u00ad tion. Several specimens containing conspicuous cinna\u00ad bar have about 0.5-1 percent of it by volume; the richest vne contains about 7 percent. (One volume per\u00ad cent cinnabar is roughly equivalent to 1 weight percent mercury in antimony ore of average grade.) In some specimens, very sparse cinnabar was detectable only after sawing. Presumably cinnabar is absent from some of the antimony ore. Nevertheless, the sketchy data suggest that, under current economic conditions, the antimony ore from this deposit is also an ore of mercury. (See accompanying chemical data.) Cinnabar is the only red 1nineral identified so far, although other red minerals resembling cinnabar-such as kermesite ( Sb2S20), containing Sb and As)-might be expected in an ore of this type. The identification of cinnabar, based on qualitative optical properties and microchem\u00ad ical tests (Hg and S positive, Sb and As negative), has been confirmed by an X-ray powder diffraction pattern made by Fred A. Hildebrand, Geological Survey. B26 ECONOMIC GEOLOGY Pyrite and arsenopyrite ( ~) are of interest because of their possible association with gold. For example, Cooper (1951, p. 167) states that the pyrite-arsenopy\u00ad rite flotation concentrates from the Yellow Pine mine, Stibnite, Idaho, contained 1.5 to 2.5 ounces of gold per ton. The gold content of pyrite, arsenopyrite ( ~), and their oxidation products in ore from the B and B deposit has not yet been determined. Tungsten minerals have not been identified in ore from this deposit, though small showings of scheelite are present on nearby claims of the Syringa group. A mineral that might be expected in a deposit of this sort is livingstonite, the mercury-antimony sulfide. This rare mineral has not been identified from the B and B deposit. Outwardly the mineral looks like stib\u00ad nite, from which it can perhaps be distinguished in the field by its darker, almost brownish-black color and slightly adamantine luster, and by the reddish tint of its black streak. Positive identification of livingston\u00ad ite requires study of its optical properties in polished section or analysis of the powder by X-ray diffraction. Any of the stibnite ore that shows a high mercury content but little visible cinnabar or secondary mercury minerals may be suspected of containing livingstonite or metacinnabar (black mercury sulfide) and should be subjected to approp_riate tests. CHEMICAL DATA Analytical data are given in the accompanying table. The data are for individual specimens selected to show a range in antimony and m:ercury content. The quanti\u00ad tative determinations of antimony are not yet available. Those of mercury (Hg) indicate that mercury-bearing material of ore grade is indeed present in the antimony ore. Mercury was determined spectrophometrically after suitable dilution. The concentrations are considerably higher than those which the method was devised to measure; accordingly, the reported numbers should be regarded as good approximations rather than absolute values (F. N. Ward, Geological Survey, 1964, oral communication) . Silver (Ag) is present. Its concentration is highest in the stibnite-rich sample. Since the amount of stibnite in samples 1 and 3 can be estimated by eye, the ratio of stibnite to contained silver can be approximated. If we assume that the silver is closely associated with stib\u00ad nite and likely to be concentrated with it during bene\u00ad ficiation, as it was at the Meadow Creek and Yellow Pine mines (Cooper, 1951, p. 170), high-purity stibnite concentrates prepared from these 2 samples should con\u00ad tain roughly 4 to 5 ounces of silver per ton. This is con\u00ad siderably less than the silver concentration reported for TABLE 1.-M ercury content and semiquantitative spectrographic analyses of associated elements in selected samples, B and B deposit [Weight percent.

Gold (Au) is reported as zero in the spectrographic analyses. However, sensitivity for this element is low. Gold concentrations less than 0.002 percent, equivalent to 0.58 troy ounce per ton, would not be detected. The selenium (Se) content of the samples, determined by Kam Leong, Geological Survey, is less than 1 part per million-much less than that of samples of anti-LEONARD B27 mony ore from the Yellow Pine mine, as reported by Davidson (1960, p.11). OTHER OCCURRENCES Other occurrences of stibnite are known in the Big Creek quadrangle. Information on most of these is scanty. Mercury minerals have not been recognized in any of them and are perhaps not to be expected in some, though it would be imprudent to prejudge them on this point. The occurrences are listed by number from south to north and referred to the appropriate ninth of the quadrangle. All except 1, 7, and 8 are in or near the silicified zones associated with the Profile\u00ad Smith Creek dike swarm.

GEOLOGICAL SURVEY \u00b7RESEARCH 1965- SUGGESTIONS FOR PROSPECTING FOR EVAPORITE DEPOSITS IN SOUTHWESTERN VIRGINIA By C. F. WITHINGTON, Washington, D.C. A.bstract.-Salt and gypsum are produced from deposits in the Maccrady Shale (Mississippian), in southwestern Virginia, from the only known economic deposits of these minerals in the South Atlantic States. The Maccrady is generally 50 to 100 feet thick, but locally is as much as 2,000 feet thick, probably as a result of flowage of the evaporites during thrust faulting. On the assumption that the evaporites acted as a lubricant along the thrust surfaces, new deposits of evaporites can reasonably be sought near the fault traces. Anomalously high concentra\u00ad tions of sulfate in water from springs near the faults are sug\u00ad gested as a potential aid in prospecting for concealed deposits. Although salt and gypsum are plentiful in the United States, in the South Atlantic States these important minerals are known to occur only in southwestern Vir\u00ad ginia, in deposits that crop out along the valley of the North Fork of the Holston River between\u00b7 Plasterco, in Washington County, and Locust Cove, about 20 miles to the northeast, in Smyth County (fig. 1). Salt has been produced commercially at Saltville, by brine methods, since the late 1700's. Gypsum was first mined about 1830 near Plasterco, and since then has been mined at many places between Plasterco and Locust Cove. One gypsum mine is now in operation at Plasterco, and a second is being opened at Locust Cove (Mineral In\u00ad dustries Journal, 1963). Because these deposits supply only a fraction of the salt and gypsum used in the South Atlantic States the discovery of additional sources of either mineral would be of benefit to the economy of the area. The purpose of this report is to describe briefly the geologic setting of the evaporites in Smyth and Washington Counties and to suggest other areas in southwestern Virginia where additional deposits might be found. GEOLOGIC SETTING OF THE EVAPORITE DEPOSITS The evaporites in Virginia are found locally in the Maccrady Shale of Mississippian age, which consists chiefly of red and yellow Inudstone, soft shale, and thin beds of sandstone and dolomite. The formation is gen-erally between 50 and 100 feet thick, but undisturbed thicknesses of 800 feet have been reported (Butts, 1940, p. 354.) Underlying the Maccrady is the Price Sand\u00ad stone of Mississippian age, a resistant unit that consists of fine-grained yellow sandstone and beds of shale. Overlying the Maccrady is the Little Valley Limestone which is here reinstated to former usage. It is of Mis\u00ad sissippian age and consists predominantly of argil\u00ad laceous limestone, with some beds of sandstone and shale. Although exposures of the Maccrady in Virginia are generally poor, the formation can be traced in nar\u00ad row bands, seldom more than a mile wide, northeastward for about 120 miles from the Virginia- Tennessee line, through Scott, Washington, Smyth, Wythe, and Pu\u00ad laski Counties, to a point about 3 miles west of Blacks\u00ad burg, in Montgomery County (fig. 1). Faults, which come to the surface south of the Maccrady Shale through much of this belt, have thrust older rocks over the Maccrady. Another outcrop belt of the Maccrady is in Lee, Wise, and Scott Counties, but because the Mac\u00ad crady here is thin and more clastic than that at Saltville ( Stose, 1923, p. 53), and because eva porites probably are not present, this outcrop is not included on figure 1. An understanding of the effect of the Saltville thrust on the Little Valley Limestone and the Maccrady Shale, which can be demonstrated at Plasterco, may be helpful in finding additional evaporite deposits in Virginia. The Little Valley Limestone has been folded into an overturned northeast-trending syncline by the Saltville fault, which has thrust Cambrian rocks over Mississip\u00ad pian rocks. Northeast of Saltville, the Cambrian rocks rest directly on the Maccrady and make up the uplands on the southeast side of the valley of the North Fork of the Holston River. Little Mountain on the northwest side of the Valley is formed by the resistant Price Sand\u00ad stone. The Saltville fault dips southeastward at angles that range from 20\u00b0 to 60\u00b0. A hole drilled about a mile southeast of Plasterco passed through the fault into the Maccrady at a depth of 2,400 feet (Nelson, 19\u00b758). A U.S. GEOL. SURVEY PROF. PAPER 525-B, PAGES B2~-B33 B29 B30 ECONOMIC GEOLOGY sandstone which is presumably the Price Sandstone was cut below the Maccrady at Plasterco by a drill hole in the mine, according to Mr. H. D. Decker, of the U.S. Gyp\u00ad sum Co. (oral communication, 1957). These relations are shown on a schematic cross section through Plas\u00ad terco (fig. 1). At Plasterco the Maccrady was thickened to at least 2,000 feet, and consists of both bedded and jumbled, detached masses or blocks of gypsum, anhydrite, salt, sandstone, and limestone in a matrix of red and green mudstone and shale. The amount of salt increases with depth; below about 1,500 feet it makes up most of the Maccrady. Cooper (1964, p. 93-95) comments on the tremendous thickening of the Maccrady and other for\u00ad mations within the Greendale syncline northwest of the Saltville fault, and attributes this thickening at Salt\u00ad ville and Locust Cove to downfolding during deposition of the Mississippian roc,ks. At least part of the thick\u00ad ening of the Maccrady is evidently due to plastic flowage of salt and calcium-sulfate rocks, however, for both rocks are known to thicken considerably along the axes of folds. Surface indications of the evaporites are sparse. Salt is found in salt springs and salt licks near Saltville, and gypsum in isolated outcrops in the Maccrady along the North Fork from Plasterco northeastward to Locust Cove. In the subsurface, bedded calcium sulfate occurs at the top of the Maccrady both under the Saltville fault on the southeast side of the valley and under the Little Valley Limestone on the northwest side of the valley (fig. 1). Within the upper part of the Maccrady the calcium sulfate, sandstone, limestone, and salt are in blocks typically 50 feet long, 20 feet high, and 15 feet wide. The blocks of gypsum, which are elongated northeastward parallel to the outcrops of the Maccrady, are randomly distributed through the clay matrix, and finding new blocks is difficult. The calcium sulfate is mainly gypsum down to a depth of about 1,000 feet; below that depth anhydrite predominates. The gyp\u00ad sum is white, is medium to fine grained, and is either massive or laminated with shale; the gypsum laminae are as much as 5 mm thick and the shale laminae as much as 1 mm. The laminae are original bedding features within the gypsum. Masses of petroliferous shale and black magnesian limestone occur at places within the gypsum. ORIGIN OF THE EVAPORITES The origin of the evaporites in southwestern Virginia has been the subject of much speculation. Several early writers regarded the gypsum as an alteration product of limestone, possibly of very recent age (Rogers, 1884, p. 141-142, reprinted from a report of 1836; Lesley, 1862; and Stevenson, 1885). Eckel (1903, p. 406) con\u00ad cluded that both the salt and gypsum were formed as part of the original depositional sequence through the evaporation of sea water, and he gave an early Car\u00ad boniferous age to the deposits. Stose ( 1913) described the evaporite-bearing beds and named them the Mac\u00ad crady Shale from exposures near Maccrady (McCready on fig. 1), a town northeast of Saltville. He believed that the evaporites were derived from calcareous-argil\u00ad laceous sediments that originally contained finely dis\u00ad seminated gypsum and salt which had been precipitated in a partly enclosed arm of the sea during the deposi\u00ad tion of the Maccrady Shale, and that the evaporites were later further enriched as ground waters dissolved calcium carbonate and carried it away. Since Stose published his report in 1913, the evaporites have been better exposed and better explored. Because laminated gypsum, typical of bedded gypsum deposits, has been found in the isolated gypsum blocks, it is now certain that the salt and calcium sulfate, probably in the form of anhydrite, were deposited as part of the original depositional sequence. On the basis of stratigraphic conditions elsewhere it can be assumed that near Plasterco and Saltville the Maccrady originally consisted of bedded calcium sul\u00ad fate, salt, shale, and thin sandstone in a unit that was about 100 feet thick. The Maccrady acted as a lubri\u00ad cated mass over which the thrust plate glided. In the process of thrusting, the overriding mass squeezed the Maccrady before it, concentrating the calcium sulfate and salt by plastic flowage, and thickening the forma\u00ad tion. At this time, limestone and other impurities were included in the evaporites. Then, as Cullison (1938, p. 36) has suggested, the thrust distorted the rocks and broke them to form the isolated blocks. Fragments of the Little Valley Limestone and probably of the under\u00ad lying Price were also broken off and included in the jumbled mass of the Maccrady. The bedded gypsum found in the Plasterco mine at the top of the Maccrady was little disturbed by the overriding mass; evidently most of the action of the thrust took place east and southeast of Plastereo. AREAS AND METHODS OF PROSPECTING Only in the 20-mile-long belt that extends north\u00ad eastward from Plasterco is it certain that evaporites exist.

An 8-foot bed of gypsum in the New\u00ad man Limestone of Mississippian age, exposed in a rail\u00ad road tunnel between Harlan County, Ky., and Hagan, Lee County, Va. (fig. 1), about 75 miles due west of Saltville (R. L. Miller, oral communication, 1964), en\u00ad courages the belief that evaporites may be found else\u00ad where in southwestern Virginia. This occurrence is a few hundred feet stratigraphically above the Maccrady. Study of the analyses of water from more than 225 springs in southwestern Virginia (Collins and others, 1930) suggests that gypsum is more widespread than is now known. On the basis of concentration of sulfate the analyses can be classified in two groups; in one the samples contain less than 8 parts per million of sulfate, and in the other they contain 12 ppm or more. Nearly 75 percent of the analyses show less than 8 ppm of sul\u00ad fate, and 20 percent of them contain 12 ppm or more. These springs, which are mostly in Wythe, Pulaski, and Montgomery Counties, flow from the Cambrian rocks that have been thrust over the Maccrady Shale by the Pulaski or Saltville faults. Few of the analyses above 12 ppm of sulfate are from springs north of the Saltville fault. The locations of the springs yielding water that contained more than 12 ppm of sulfate are shown on figure 1. Among the 17 sulfate values shown, 15 range from 12 to 46 ppm, one is 1,000 ppm, and one is 2,500 ppm. It is not certain, of course, that the anomalous sulfate in the analyses comes from the solu\u00ad tion of calcium sulfate, nor are there corresponding increases of sodium and chloride in the analyses. The fact that most of the springs with the higher concentra\u00ad tions of sulfate flow from the Cambrian rocks that have overridden the Maccrady strongly suggests that the sulfate in the ground water is derived from gypsum in the Maccrady. The absence of anomalous amounts of chloride in the analyses is not surprising, because any salt exposed to ground water would have long since been removed. The very high concentrations of sulfat-e are thought to reflect a relatively short distance of travel of the solution; the lower values probably are due to longer travel and greater dilution by ground water. Even where all traces of evaporites have been re\u00ad moved from the outcrop, and where only a poorly de\u00ad fined collapse-breccia remains, deposits might still be found in the subsurface. Figure 1, which is from the geologic map of Virginia (Calver, 1963), shows where the Maccrady has been overridden by older rocks along the Saltville fault, which is in S1nyth and Washington Counties, or along the Pulaski fault, the trace of which runs northeastward from Washington County to Mont\u00ad gomery County. Analyses of water from springs near faults should be examined for above-average concen-. trations of calcium sulfate. To be significant these concentrations need not be especially high, for both the salt and gypsum are encased in clay which, where it is particularly impermeable, must protect these rela\u00ad tively soluble minerals from attack by ground water. Drilling should be done southeast of the outcrop of the Maccrady, and even southeast of the trace of the faults, because the thickest part of the Maccrady is downdip from the undisturbed outcrop along the North Fork of the Holston River (fig. 1). Care should be taken not to drill too far southeast of the trace of the fault, however, for the action of the thrust probably squeezed all the salt before it, so that within a mile or so south\u00ad east of the trace, all that remains of the Maccrady is likely to be a jumbled mass of clay, sandstone, and limestone. The areas shown on figure 1, in which prospecting might be successful, include: ( 1) Smyth and Washing\u00ad ton Counties south of the outcrop of the Maccrady and south of the Saltville fault; (2) Smyth and Wythe Counties south of the Pulaski fault, from Groseclose in Smyth County to Gunton Park in Wythe County; (3) an area from Pulaski northward and thence eastward into Montgomery County where the Maccrady is over\u00ad thrust by the Pulaski fault ; and ( 4) an area northeast of Blacksburg, in Montgomery County, in which the !-Iaccrady does not crop out, but where spring water south of the Pulaski fault contains as much as 30 ppm of sulfate.

GEOLOGICAL SURVEY RESEARCH 1965 LOW-VOLATILE BITUMINOUS COAL OF MISSISSIPPIAN AGE ON THE LISBURNE PENINSULA, NORTHWESTERN ALASKA By IRVIN L. TAILLEUR, Menlo Park, Calif. Abstract.-Near the middle of the west cotast of the Lisburne Peninsula, in a formation that extends 30 miles or more along the west side of the Lisburne Hills, a thick section of moderately to strongly deformed quartzite, fine-grained clastic rocks, and coal having a :flora of Early Mississippian age contains' 13 coal seams 2\u00a52 feet or more thick and about 70 feet in aggregate thickness. Analyses (on an as-received basis) of representative samples of the low-volatile bituminous cotal reveal 13 to 21 per\u00ad cent volatile matter, 68 to 80 percent fixed carbon, 3 to 16 per\u00ad cent ash, 11,800 to 14,300 Btu, and 1.4 to 1.5 specific gravity. This apparently good-quality coal is, at least, a potential local source of fuel for Point Hope village. Low-volatile bituminous coal exposed in sea cliffs south of Cape Lisburne has been known for more than 60 years. Although originally reported (Collier, 1906) as having an economic potential worth further investi\u00ad gation, the coal has not been prospected thoroughly. On detailed examination of some of the exposures during regional mapping,1 this writer found the original evalu\u00ad ation to be valid and concluded that the existence of these deposits of fuel of an apparent high quality war\u00ad rants further published description. Historically, coal was the earliest resource in north\u00ad western Alaska to be recognized and utilized. Coal in sea cliffs east of Cape Lisburne was discovered in 1826 by Beechey's expedition ( Beechey, 1831), and it became a refueling source for the ships, particularly the whalers and the U.S. revenue cutters, that followed into the Arctic Ocean during the nineteenth century. Coal of Carboniferous age was shown on the first geo\u00ad logic map compiled for the region ('Grewingk 1848-49) b . ' ' ut It represented the coal east of Cape Lisburne, which is a high-volatile Mesozoic coal that had been correlated with beds containing late Paleozoic fossils at the cape. The occurrence of coals of two ages in the region was not noted until the older, harder coal exposed south of Cape 1 Support in the field was furnished in part by the U.S. Atomic En\u00ad ergy Commission in 1961 and by the Arctic Research Laboratory in 1963. Lisburne was recognized in 1900 (A. G. Maddren, writ\u00ad ten communication, in Schrader, 1904, p. 113-114). Collier's ( 1906) report, based on fieldwork in 1904, includes analyses of the coal, identification of the asso\u00ad ciated flora as Mississippian in age, and the opinion that the deposits probably contain appreciable quantities of good-quality coal. Some use of the coal at the time was observed. Records of subsequent exa1ninations have not been found. A later report (Smith and Mertie, 1930, p. 292-296) repeats Collier's observation in detail, but regards the potential of the deposits somewhat con\u00ad servatively. On the recent map of the coal fields of Alaska (Barnes, 1961), the coal is shown as three iso\u00ad lated occurrences of Carboniferous bituminous coal of unknown extent. OCCURRENCE The formation containing the coal extends from Cape Dyer on the west coast to Cape Thompson on the south coast, a distance of more than 25 miles along the flank of the Lisburne Hills. It is also present in several fault blocks within the hills north of Cape Dyer (fig. 1). The formation was mapped from the Kukpuk River to Cape Thompson by Campbell (1961, fig. 354.1, rock unit ]}f s) in 1959 and 1960. The writer measured sec\u00ad tions and mapped the formation north from the Kukpuk River with the assistance of D. R. Currey in 1961, of G. S. Anderson in 1963, and ofT. P. Miller and Ander\u00ad son in 1964. Significant amounts of coal were seen on the Kukpuk River and to the north, but the coal at Cape Thompson reported to Collier ( 1906, p. 45) was not located. Coal seams or float were found at I\\:ukpuk on the lower Kuk\u00ad puk River, along sea cliffs south of Cape Dyer and Kapaloak Creek, along a stretch of beach bluffs between Kiliktukgot Creek and Cape Dyer, and at Niak Creek. Coal is therefore present in the formation at several points in a belt as much as 30 miles long. U.S. GEOL. SURVEY PROF. PAPER 525-B, PAGES B34-B38 B34 TAILLEUR B35 Area of FIGURE 1.-Mapped occurrences (stippled) of the Mississippian coal-bearing formation on the Lisburne Peninsula. Collier ( 1906, p. 43-44) described the three coastal localities. He treated the Kiliktukgot Creek (Cape Lewis) locality in greatest detail, implying that the de\u00ad posits there were Inost promising. Perhaps exposures have changed as a result of erosion of the cliffs since Collier's work, but more coal is now exposed near Kap\u00ad aloak Creek. The nearly complete cross section pro\u00ad vided by the mile of low eliffs south of J(apaloak Creek permitted detailed study and measurement of the rocks. As is shown on the sketch of the Kapaloak cliffs (fig. 2), beds dip moderately to steeply northward in the southern two-thirds of the cliffs; in the northern third of the exposure they dip southward, but this is because North 13 the beds have been overturned. Lateral persistence of beds for a few hundred feet is indicated by the bedding traces on the surface in back of the cliffs. Sharp flex\u00ad ures and overturning, and shearing and flowage of the coal, reflect intense disturbance locally. The rocks seem to form the north flank of an anticline. Nearly 2,200 feet of section was measured between the bottom of the exposed beds at the south end of the cliffs and the uppermost beds just above seam 13 at the north end. An undetermined amount of the upper part of the formation is not exposed. The measured section seems to be free of major repetitions, but the possibility of repetition of beds cannot be excluded; repeated sections could be dissimilar, and remain un\u00ad recognized, owing to lateral variations during depo\u00ad sition. Approximately 300 feet of strata at the bottom of the measured section, in the ridge shown at the south end of figure 2, is not coaly. These beds consist of dark, partly calcareous, fine-grained rocks that n1ay be marine in origin. The remaining strata, approximately 1,900 feet thick, consist of orthoquartzite, shale, and mudstone in sets of beds of variable thickness, and of clay and seams or zones of coal. These rocks were deposited largely, if not wholly, in a nonmarine environment. Plant re\u00ad mains collected fron1 zones about 500, 900, 1,100, and 1,400 feet above the base of the measured section were identified by S. H. Mamay (written communication, 1963) and correlated by him with floral zones I and II \u00b7 of the (Early) Mississippian (Read and Mamay, 1960). Coal seams present throughout the upper 1,900 feet range in thickness from a fraction of an inch to 11 feet. Thirteen seams in the upper 1,200 feet are 2112 feet or more thick and have an aggregate thickness of about 70 feet. Detailed sections of these thicker seams are given in table 1. Most of these thicker seams are sep\u00ad arated, one from another, by about a hundred feet of barren beds and thinner seams. Figure 3 illustrates the appearance, in the cliffs, of many of the seams.

The coal seam is overlain by quartzite and plant-bearing shale and is underlain by clay and mudstone . CHARACTER OF THE COAL Separate channel :;;amples of pure and impure parts of the thicker seam3 were collected and stored in bags in 1961. Seam 8 was resampled in 1963, and the sam\u00ad ple was stored in a sealed can to permit approximation of the original bed-moisture content. Analyses of seven representative samples by the U.S. Bureau of Mines laboratory, Pittsburgh, Pa., are listed in table 2, together with the analyses reported by Collier ( 1906, p. 43-45). Specifi(l gravities of small lumps from seams 3, 7, and 11 were determined to be 1.4, 1.4, and 1.5 respectively, similar to two determinations by Col\u00ad lier (1906, p. 46) that averaged 1:37. Although the analyses all represent outcrop samples and hence do not reflect true bed-moisture content, the high ratio of fixed earbon to volatile matter, the hard\u00ad ness, and the relatively high specific gravity suggest that all the coal is probably of low-volatile bituminous rank. The coal should be a good-quality fuel because similar coals elsewhere serve extensively for domestic heating and steam generation (W. H. Oppelt, U.S. Bu\u00ad reau of Mines, written communication, 1963). RESERVES AND POTENTIAL USE Reliable estimates of the amount of coal present will require prospecting away from the beaches or river\u00ad banks. Because the amount of coal in the exposed sec\u00ad tions is probably fairly representative of the coal con\u00ad tent of the formation in adjoining areas, significant deposits of coal are believed to underlie the thin cover of rubble inland from the beaches at the Kapaloak and Kiliktukgot localities. Strong deformation at the Niak Creek locality precludes reliable estimation of the extent of the coal there. On the Kukpuk River, where there is only one seam of appreciable thickness, most of the outcrops are quartzite and the extent of the coal can\u00ad not be determined. The area from the west coast to the Kukpuk River has not been examined in sufficient de\u00ad tail to determine the distribution of coal there. Physical conditions of the region are adverse for ex\u00ad ploitation of the coal, largely because of the Arctic set\u00ad ting: ( 1) The region is remote from centers of potential heavy use. (2) The climate is severe, and permafrost probably prevades the ground away from the shorelines. (3) The navigation season lasts only from late June to the end of September. (4) The coast is exposed and the Kukpuk River is extremely shoal at times. ( 5) Maryatt Inlet is the only nearby protected anchorage, and it is suitable only for vessels of 10-foot draft or less. Practical access to the deposits at present is limited to landings by umiak (Eskimo skin boat) chartered at Point Hope village, or to landings on gravel bars near Kukpuk in a light airplane chartered at Kotzebue, 150 miles to the southeast. Rights to the coal localities may be another factor of significance. The recorded claims noted in 1930 (Smith and Mertie, 1930, p. 292) do not appear to have been maintained, but evidence of recent and ancient habitation is abundant near each locality of exposed coal. As natives have inhabited the area continuously for at least the last several hundred years (Rainey, 194 7), the possibility of native rights exists and needs to be taken into account. At the present time, a small work force is available locally for mining, and small quantities of the coal might be substituted for imported fuel in the coastal \u00b7 villages and installations, but local and regional mar\u00ad kets can use only a small part of the potential produc\u00ad tion from the deposits. However, prospects are good for the development of large-scale metal-mining oper\u00ad ations on the upper Kobuk River, 150 miles east of Kot\u00ad zebue, which would create a large demand for energy, and possibly a large market for these coal deposits. The writer believes that the coal has an important potential as a local source of fuel for the village of Point Hope, only 30 miles from the closest deposits. Despite the village's proximity and its tradition of making max\u00ad imum use of available resources, this fuel of apparently high quality is not utilized in the village. Instead, oil and coal are imported from the conterminous United States for fud. Residents of the village say that the local coal will not burn. However, the coal is combusti\u00ad ble; probably it was not tested in the village under con\u00ad ditions suited to its hardness. Maddren (Schrader, 1904, p. 113) noted that the coal burned in the galley stove but was too hard to burn under the ship's boilers without forced draft.

Then the deposits could be investigated as a practical source of fuel. Substitution of local fuel for imported fuel would be economically beneficial because nearly one-fifth of the relatively meager cash income of the village is now spent on im\u00ad ported fuel (D. C. Foote, U.S. Atomic Energy Commis\u00ad sion, written communication, 1961). Because not much of this cash would be needed to exploit the local coal, the money available for nonsubsistence purchases would be increased by nearly 50 percent. In addition, the economy would become even more self sustaining, thereby enhancing the preservation of the unusual blend of Eskimo and modern cultures that now exists in the village. Beechey, F.

' GEOLOGICAL SURVEY RESEARCH 1965 DISTRIBUTION OF GRAVEL IN THE PATUXENT FORMATION IN THE BELTSVILLE QUADRANGLE, PRINCE GEORGES AND MONTGOMERY COUNTIES, MARYLAND By C. F. WITHINGTON, Washington, D.C. Abstract.-In the Beltsville quadrangle, the Patuxent For\u00ad mation of Early Cretaceous age is chiefly sand and clay but con\u00ad tains economically important deposits of gravel. A contour map of the ratio of gravel to sand and clay suggests that the gravel was deposited in south-and southwest-trending channels in an alluvial plain. Erosion of the gently dipping formation left the gravel deposits in hilltops. Searching along extensions of the mapped channels, especially where pieces of iron-cemented gravel occur in colluvium, offers the greatest chance of finding new gravel deposits. The most important mineral resource in the Belts\u00ad ville quadrangle, Montgomery and Prince Georges Counties, Md., is gravel in the Patuxent Formation of Early Cretaceous age (fig. 1), which is used extensively for aggregate throughout the northern part of the Washington metropolitan area. This report describes the occurrence of the Patuxent gravel and offers guides for prospecting for new deposits. Younger gravels, which are not extensive and which contain fragments of deleterious material such as chert. and friable sandstone, are unimportant and are not discussed. The Patuxent Formation ranges in thickness from a knife edge near its western edge to as much as 100 feet in the subsurface in the southeastern part of the quad\u00ad rangle (fig. 2). The rocks dip southeastward at the rate of 60 to 80 feet per mile. Erosion has removed much of the formation, especially along the present valleys, so that the Patuxent is found only on the hills and the dis\u00ad tribution of its gravel bears no relation to the present drainage pattern. The Patuxent consists predominantly of sand and clay with lesser amounts of gravel. The sand is coarse to fine and yellow to purple. It consists chiefly of subangular to subrounded quartz grains but is locally micaceous. It is in crossbedded layers. The clay occurs as beds and lenses throughout the formation. Most of it is white, although some is red or yellow. The gravel is generally poorly sorted and consists of subrounded to rounded quartz and quartzite particles and very minor a.mounts of sandstone and chert. The stones range from 2-mm granules to elongate cobbles as much as 25 em (about 10 inches) long; their average size by weight is about 10 mm. The sand fraction ( 0.07 4-2 mm; average about 0.5 mm) makes up as much as 80 percent of some samples but averages about 30 percent. Clay and silt (finer than 0.07 4 mm) together amount to only about 1 percent of the material by weight. The gravel deposits occur stratigraphically through\u00ad out the formation. In places the entire thickness of the formation is predominantly gravel; in other places the gravel alternates with sand and clay. Thicknesses of more than 50 feet of gravel have been exposed in some gravel pits .. Iron oxide which cements much of the upper part of the formation is concentrated as a cap at the contact o~ the Patuxent with the clay of the overlying Patapsco Formation. It seems likely that the iron cement was deposited contemporaneously with the sediment, much as it is being deposited at present along the Mullica River in southern New Jersey (Lang, 1961). There, ground water containing more than 11 parts per mil\u00ad lion of iron moves upward toward the river, where the iron is oxidized and precipitates in the near-surface layers of bed material. In the Patuxent Formation, gravel commonly contains a thicker layer of iron than sand, presumably because larger volumes of iron-bear\u00ad ing ground water flowed through the more permeable materials. Thus, where the upper part of the formation is sand the cement is thin and friable, but where the upper part is gravel the cement is thick and hard. Moreover, the thicker and more permeable the gravel, the thicker the cemented layer. It is interesting to note that in the Beltsville quadrangle, the iron -cemented layers are found almost exclusively in the Patuxent Formation. U.S. GEOL. SURVEY PROF.

Location of section is shown on figure 1. The shapes of the gravel bodies, the depositional trends indicated by the foreset beds exposed in gravel pits, and the areal distribution of the gravel units sug\u00ad gest that these sediments represent channel fills of an ancient river system in the Patuxent Formation. In order to confirm the presence of this apparent system and to determine the distribution of the gravel deposits, especially where they are covered by colluvium, ratios of the amount of gravel to that of sand and clay in many vertical sections were estimated, and lines that limit what may be channel boundaries were drawn to connect points of equal ratios of gravel to sand and clay. Data from drill-hole logs were used in addition to field observations made in gravel and sand pits and other exposures. Because the thickest gravel deposits invari\u00ad ably occur within the inferred channels, a ratio of 1 : 1 was assumed to represent the boundary of an actual channel. The gravel, of course, is not evenly distrib\u00ad uted within the channels because the rivers meandered and their transporting power varied within the chan\u00ad nels. Cross beds and directions of deposition as shown in channel axes were measured wherever possible and were plotted on a detailed map to establish the direction of strea.mflow (Withington, 1964). A summary map (fig. 1) constructed from that detailed map shows the location of the deposits of a Cretaceous river system that drained south and southwest across the quadrangle. The surface drainage during Patuxent time had not pre-viously been established for the Beltsville area.; Darton and l{eith ( 1901, p. 6) mentioned that although there was apparently a shoreline east of Washington during Early Cretaceous time, the nature of the surface drain\u00ad age is not known. It is evident that the source rocks were not to the west of the Beltsville area, for certainly some of the sand\u00ad stones of the Newark Series 'vould be included in the Patuxent gravels. Thus Clark and others (1911, p. 80-81) observed that the Patuxent contained no frag\u00ad ments of sandstone of the Newark Group, which is now exposed less than 10 miles west of the Beltsville area. Nevertheless, they believed that the drainage in Patux\u00ad ent time was from the west, and suggested that rocks of the Newark Group were less resistant than they are now and hence did not survive transport together with the harder quartz and quartzite, or that the rocks of the Newark Group were then covered by water. The gravel in the Patuxent Formation contains neither mica nor fragments of the sandstones of the Newark Group, both of which are present in younger gravels in this area. It therefore seems unlikely that the source rocks lay to the west of the Beltsville area. Thus, although we cannot identify a source of the stones in the gravel it appears most probable that the source lay north of this area and east of the Newark basin. The rivers that deposited the gravel flowed in shoe\u00ad string-shaped channels across a surface of low relief B42 ECONOMIC GEOLOGY on the mica schists of the Piedmont province. Al\u00ad though the sand in the interstr&'lm areas is locally mica\u00ad ceous, that in the river channels is not; therefore, it is assumed that little material was contributed to the channels from the interstream areas. Little gravel is found outside the ehannels, and it seems evident that the material contributed to the interchannel areas was deposited only during periods of flooding. Because it contains little deleterious material such as soft sand\u00ad stone or chert, this gravel is particularly valuable for all construction uses. Any prospecting for new deposits of gravel should be done along the extension of the channels in the Belts\u00ad ville quadrangle as well as in the adjoining quadrangles. The presence of fragments of iron -cemented gravel in the colluvium is a useful indicator of concealed gravel. The possible presence of gravel deposits in the Patuxent where it is overlain by a thin cover of clay of the Patapsco Formation should not be overlooked. REFERENCES Clark, W. B., Bi'bbons, A.

GEOLOGICAL SURVEY HSEARCH 1965 STRUCTURE OF THE TIMBER MOUNTAIN CALDERA, SOUTHERN NEVADA, AND ITS RELATION TO BASIN-RANGE STRUCTURE By ROBERT L. CHRISTIANSEN, P. W. LIPMAN, PAUL P. ORKILD, and F. M. BYERS, JR., Denver, Colo. Work done in cooperation with the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission A.bstract.-The Timber Mountain volcanic structure formed in three stages: early broad doming, caldera ool'lapse, and resurgent doming of the caldera floor. As the early dome developed, its extended roof was downdropped along a zone of concentric faults, and subsequent caldera collapse occurred along roughly the same zone. Regional normal faults contemporaneous with the volcanic structure were adapted to it, and some of them were utilized in extension of the early dome and in caldera collapse. The Timber Mountain caldera is a large collapsed vol\u00ad canic structure in the Nevada Test Site area of southern Nevada (fig. 1). It lies at the edge of the Walker Lane, a transitional zone in the basin-range region between the dominantly parallel structural and topographic trends of the central Great Basin and the more varied trends to the southwest (Locke and others, 1940). Although to\u00ad pography in the Timber Mountain area is generally more subdued than in the surrounding region, the domi\u00ad nant structures form a characteristic basin-range pat\u00ad tern of antithetic fault blocks. Recent geologic map\u00ad ping in the region has shown that development of basin\u00ad range structure in this area was strongly influenced by the simultaneous development of the Timber Mountain volcanic structure. An area of about 2,500 square miles surrounding Timber Mountain is a much faulted and eroded plateau consisting almost entirely of upper Tertiary volcanic deposits. Large basin-range faults have outlined such features as the Ka wich and Belted Ranges, Yucca Flat, Crater Flat, and Bare Mountain around the edges of this plateau. The less faulted inner part of the plateau has been partly preserved on Pahute Mesa, Rainier Mesa, Shoshone Mountain, and Yucca Mountain. Tim\u00ad ber Mountain is an isolated structural and topographic 116\u00b0 0 10 20 30 40 MILES FIGURE 1.-lndex map of part of Nevada and California, show\u00ad i:ng area of figure 2 (stippled) . high in the center of this disrupted plateau, within a roughly circular depressed area about 18 by 20 miles across. This depression is a caldera formed by collapse during and after eruption of a large volume of ash\u00ad flow tuff from vents in the Timber Mountain area (Byers U.S. GEOL. SURVEY PROF. PAPER 525-B, PAGES B43.:.B48 758-810 0-65 - 4 B43 B44 STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY AND STRATIGRAPHY and others, 1g63). The Rainier Mesa Member, an ash\u00ad flow cooling unit of the Timber Mountain Tuff, is the product of these eruptions. The Paintbrush Tuff, an older ash-flow sequence from another center, makes a good stratigraphic datmn for resolving the structural history of the Timber Molmtain area. As the upper part of the Paintbrush Tuff and the Timber Mountain Tuff are both early Pliocene, on the basis of K-Ar dating of 20 samples of biotite and sanidine by R. W. Kistler (in P. P. Orkild, report in preparation), the Timber Mountain volcanic structure is also Pliocene. This paper is based on the observations of the authors and their coworkers in the 1napping of nine 71h-minute quadrangles covering the area of figure 2. Eight of these quadrangles were mapped at a scale of 1: 24,000. The remaining quadrangle, in the southwestern corner of the area, was mapped geologically at a scale of 1:48,000. BASIN-\u00b7RANGE FAU'L TS The basin-range faults of the region around Timber Mountain are norn1al, with dips between 60\u00b0 and goo and average trends about due north (fig. 2). Most large faults of this system are relatively downthrown to the west, and the intervening blocks are tilted to the east, but smaller faults are both synthetic and anti\u00ad thetic to the major faults. The few large faults rela\u00ad tively downthrown to the east occur in two distinct settings closely related to the Timber Mountain vol\u00ad canic structure, as discussed later. Almost no basin-range faulting predating the Paint\u00ad brush Tuff can be recognized around Timber Mountain, although some can be demonstrated in nearby areas. Major faulting discernible in the Timber Mountain area is of post-Paintbrush age and largely predates the post\u00ad collapse rhyolites on the south rim of the caldera; later movements on these faults were minor. Consequently, basin-range faulting was occurring contemporaneously with development of the Timber Mountain volcanic structure. STRUCTURES RE'LATED TO THE CALDE'RA A broad domical swell developed in the Timber area before the climactic ash-flow eruptions Evidence of this broad doming is clear\u00ad est on the south side of the structure. Outward dips of the dome are preserved in the Paintbrush Tuff on and near Yucca Mountain, although modified by tilting of the basin-range fault blocks. The edge of the dome is marked by a hinge line concentric with the caldera and having a radius of about 14 miles (fig. 2). Outside this hinge, the pretilting attitudes were horizontal. Evidence for the precaldera age of the broad doming comes from several features. Some geometrical rela\u00ad tions of the basin-range faults to the broad dome dis\u00ad cussed later clearly indicate that these two structural features developed largely contemporaneously, and in a number of places the tuffs of the caldera-forming Rainier Mesa eruptions are unconformable on these basin-range faults. At the edge of Crater Flat, the Rainier Mesa Member is relatively flat lying on the tilted blocks of Paintbrush Tuff that mark the edge of the dome. Stratigraphic evidence indicates that the Rainier Mesa Member was never deposited on the high\u00ad est part of Yucca Mountain, although these ash flows extended for many tens of miles to the west, north, and east. Thus, the broadly domed portion of Yucca Moun\u00ad tain inside the hinge already was high topographically when the Rainier Mesa tuffs were erupted. The under\u00ad lying, easily erodible, uppermost 5 feet of the topmost member of the Paintbrush is, however, widely pre\u00ad served. Further evidence for the precollapse age of the broad doming is the presence of pre-Rainier Mesa rhyo\u00ad litic lavas that were extruded through faults related to the doming north and northeast of Crater Flat. A set of circumferential faults is exposed on the southern caldera rim. The outermost have a radius of about 10 miles. Due south of the center of the caldera they are nearly at right angles to the regional basin\u00ad range fault trends, but they follow the arc of the caldera rim for about goo. All the circumferential faults are normal. Some are relatively downthrown to the north, others to the south, but the cumulative displacement of the blocks, which are partially self supporting in key\u00ad stone fashion, is downward to the north. The regional basin-range fault trends are tangential to the caldera on the east and west sides of the structure, and here the outermost movements of the circumferential fault zone were on basin-range faults. The circumferential faults just described are not the principal caldera-forming faults, although they are geo\u00ad metrically related. Mapping clearly shows that the cir\u00ad cumferential faults on the south side of the structure postdate the Paintbrush Tuff but predate most, and per\u00ad haps all, of the Timber Mountain Tuff. Relations de\u00ad scribed later between circumferential faults and basin\u00ad range faults indicate that these outer circumferential faults were formed during the early broad doming and probably accommodated extension of the roof of the dome although they may have been reactivated in part during caldera collapse. The eroded wall of the caldera which formed by col\u00ad lapse of the central area of the broad dome during and after eruption of the Rainier Mesa ash flows is largely preserved around nearly 270\u00b0 of arc from the south-CHRISTIANSEN , LIPMAN , ORKILD, AND BYErRS 0 2 3 4 5 ~ Post-Timber Mountain units and post collapse lavas (includes moat rhyolites) Timber Mountain Tuff (includes Rainier Mesa Member) D Paintbrush Tuff and precollapse lavas D Pre-Paintbrush units 6 MILES :::> 0 FIGURE 2.-Generalized geologic map of the Timber Mountain area, Nevada.

B45 B46 STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY AND STRATIGRAPHY western to the northern side. The northwestern part of the wall is buried under younger ash-flow tuffs that also partly fill the caldera moat. All units within the caldera consist of young rocks either equivalent to others out\u00ad side the rim at high elevations or restr!cted to the cal\u00ad dera and emplaced into it after it formed. The Timber Mountain caldera is characterized by an out~r depression or moat and a central dome and is thus classed as a resurgent cauldron (Smith and Bailey, 1962). The moat contains the fault zone along which the caldera floor collapsed. Although the moat is largely buried by later volcanic and sedimentary rocks, it can be demonstrated that the caldera collapsed as a nearly undisturbed central core bounded by a distinct ring\u00ad fracture zone in the present moat area. Most of the faults of the central area are linear graben faults re\u00ad lated to its resurgent doming and not to collapse (Carr, 1964) ; only the reactivated inner edge of the ring-frac\u00ad ture zone is exposed around the outermost southeastern flank of the central dome. The presence of a ring-frac\u00ad ture zone beneath the moat is indicated not only by the general structural pattern just described but also by a group of postcollapse rhyolitic lava domes within the moat area, encircling the central dome. A mechanical analysis by David Cummings (written communication, 1964) based on a model from elastic plate theory has related positions of the hinge line, the zone of circumferential faults, and the central initially unfaulted area to stresses developed during broad doming. The moat rhyolites, a few relatively small rhyolitic bodies on the central dome, the flows related to early broad doming, and a group of postcollapse flows along the southern caldera rim are the only rhyolitic lava flows directly related to the Timber Mountain volcan\u00ad ism; they were all localized by major elements of the volcanic structure. Early broad doming and accompanying circumfer\u00ad ential faulting which preceded caldera curred sometime the period between emplace\u00ad ments of the Paintbrush Tuff and the Rainier Mesa Member ~f the Timber Mountain Tuff, a period of about 1.5 million years (based on K-Ar dating of sanidine and biotite by R. W. Kistler, written communication, 1963). This process probably was continuous up to the time of eruption of the Rainier Mesa Member. Large-scale col\u00ad lapse of the structure, related to the Rainier Mesa ash flows, was probably very rapid, perhaps catastrophic. Oversteepened walls slumped into the caldera both as large shattered but coherent blocks and as debris flows and unsorted colluvium. One large lobate block on the northeast side of the caldera is a virtually coherent piece of the slumped outer wall bounded by faults that cross the basin-range fault trends. The third major stage of evolution of the Timber Mountain structure, resurgent doming, appears to have continued, perhaps intermit\u00ad tently, over an appreciable span of geologic time. Ash\u00ad flow tuffs were emplaced in the moat about 3.5 million years after collapse (on the basis of K-Ar dating of sanidine) and after resurgent doming had formed the moat; they have been uplifted and tilted eastward on the east flank of the central dome. RELATIONS BETWEEN BASIN-RANGE FAULTS AND THE TIMBER MOUNTAIN VOLCANIC ST-RUCTURE The overall structure and history of the Timber Mountain caldera are similar to those of the Valles caldera of New Mexico (Smith and others, 1961). The greater complication of the Timber Mountain struc\u00ad ture results largely from the contemporaneous regional block faulting. Stratigraphic relations and certain geometric features of the faults indicate that basin-range faulting and early broad domical swelling of the Timber Mountain area occurred at roughly the same time. It has been shown that both the broad doming and much of the basin-range faulting are of post-Paintbrush Tuff and pre-Rainier Mesa Member age. There are also anum\u00ad ber of ways in which the basin-range faults on the outer flank of the Timber Mountain structure reflect the con\u00ad current doming and extension. The hinge line bound\u00ad ing the broad dome is a narrow zone in which displace\u00ad ments on most faults are at a minimum and from which both the number of faults and their displacements in\u00ad crease in both directions. The maximum displacement is at the outer limit of circumferential faulting. South of the hinge, outside the domed area, many faults show notable drag, but to the north, most of the faults have little or no drag. Fault intersections along the south rim of the caldera indicate that the circumferential and basin-range fault systems developed in part contemporaneously. Basin\u00ad range faults offset circumferential faults in some places, are offset by them in some others, and terminate against them in yet others. It is apparent, however, that broad doming and circumferential faulting had begun before some of the largest basin-range faults became active. Several large faults belonging to a complex graben near Pinyon Pass terminate against the southernmost cir\u00ad cumferential fault. This curved fault concentric with the caldera has an exposed strike length of about 2\u00a52 miles and an average downthrow to the north of abo~t 600 feet. Only 2 of 12 basin-range faults mapped up to it from the south offset it, and none of those terminat\u00ad ing against it are offset to new positions on the north side. Clearly this fault formed a boundary against CHRISTIANSEN, LIPMAN, ORKILD, AND BYERS B47 which movement of the fault blocks to the south was taken up. This zone of fault intersections beca.me the locus for eruption of both precollapse and postcollapse rhyolitic lavas along the southern rim area. These re\u00ad lations, along with those described between basin-range faults and the early broad dome, show the concentric fault zone to be a part of the broad dome rather than part of the caldera-forming ring-fracture zone. Within the hinge line, the basin-range faults change from regional northerly trends to be.come radial to the volcanic structure. These are not true radial faults directly resulting from doming; there are, for example, no east-west faults either east or west of the caldera. They do, however, indicate a mechanical influence of the broad dome with its circumferentially faulted roof on the basin-range fault pattern. An analysis of the stress field resulting from interaction between the vol\u00ad canic structure and regional normal faulting has shown that these changing fault trends are to be expected (David Cummings, written commtmication, 1964). On the outer flanks of the broad dome south of the caldera a few large normal faults of the basin-range set have displacements opposite to the dominant re\u00ad gional sense and produce parallel complex grabens in the flanks of the dome. The profile of the early swell is approximately preserved in the dips of the Paintbrush Tuff on the north end of Yucca Mountain, although modified by tilting of the fault blocks. Attitudes in the grabens, however, continue north from the hinge line at the same regional gradient as in the rocks to the south. These grabens partially collapse the flank of the Timber Mountain volcanic structure beyond the edge of the caldera along linear troughs parallel to the re\u00ad gional tectonic trend. They are volcanic sector grabens as described by Williams ( 1941, p. 309-311). At least two of the major faults responsible for producing such grabens are scissor faults which near the hinge line change in displacement from the dominant regional sense to the opposed sense. On the southwest side of the caldera, large normal faults also have displacements opposite to the dominant regional ones. They mark the outer limit of circumfer\u00ad ential and tangential faulting by downdropping blocks toward the caldera, opposite to the regional sense. By contrast on the east side of the caldera the dominant ' regional downdropping along normal faults is the same as that required to accommodate extension of the roof of the broad dome and caldera collapse; the tangential faults here have the regional sense. On this side, how\u00ad ever the walls slumped extensively along preexisting faults after the caldera formed. The faults along which these blocks slumped were apparently opened as surficial gashes, and some of them filled with coarse colluvial de-bris. In addition, the principal fault blocks are tilted westward, toward the caldera, even though the fault throws are also to the west. Relatively few basin-range faults occur within the Timber Mountain caldera, despite demonstrable post\u00ad collapse displacements on several faults outside the cal\u00ad dera. Some faults do displace caldera rim rocks and continue into the moat only to lose displacement or break into en echelon series and die out, probably re\u00ad flecting the boundary effects of the circumferential and ring faults and of shattering within the caldera during collapse. The relations between basin-range faulting and the Timber Mountain volcanic structure are summarized below. (1) Before the voluminous ash-flow eruptions and subsequent collapse, a broad structural dome developed over an area larger than the later caldera. Extension of the roof of this broad dome was accommodated by concentric normal faults along which the roof was down\u00ad dropped. ( 2) Regional block faulting and tilting were largely contemporaneous with the broad doming but have con\u00ad tinued since. The regional faulting was adjusted to the zone of extension resulting from early doming. The number of faults and the displacement on each increased toward the center from a minimum at the edge of the broad dome to a maximum at the outer edge of the zone of circumferential faults. Basin-range faults near the outer edge of the circumferential fault zone tended to be deflected to trends radial to the dome because of the mechanical influence of the faulted roof. Both before and after caldera collapse, the intersection between these fault systems became a locus of extrusion of rhyolitic lavas. Several sector grabens extended outward along the regional fault trends from the outer concentric faults, downdropping segments of the broad dome. Basin-range faults tangential to the structure on the west and east were utilized as parts of the zone of cir\u00ad cumferential extension. (3) Catastrophic collapse of the Timber Mountain caldera, related to eruption of the Rainier Mesa ash flows occurred along a well defined ring-fracture zone ' f . approximately coincident with the earlier zone o Cir- cumferential extension faults. Formation of the cal\u00ad dera retarded development of regional normal faults within the collapsed area. ( 4) Resurgent doming uplifted the floor of the cal\u00ad dera inside the ring-fracture zone, with concurrent development of a set of extension faults, shallow intru\u00ad sion of granite, and extrusion of rhyolitic lavas on this central dome (Carr, 1964). Rhyolitic lavas were also B48 STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY AND STRATIGRAPHY erupted through the ring-fracture zone into the caldera moat. REFERENCES Byers, F. M., Jr., Orkild, P. P., Carr, W.

GEOLOGICAL SURVEY RESEARCH 1965 THE CLINCHPORT THRUST FAULT\u00ad A MAJOR STRUCTURAL ELEMENT OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS By LEONARD D. HARRIS, Knoxville, Tenn. Abstract.-Mapping and detailed facies studies of Cambrian rocks in key areas suggest that the trace of the Clinchport thrust fault, parts of which have previously been named the St. Clair, Honaker, Whiteoak Mountain, and Taylor Ridge faults, extends from Virginia to Georgia. In Tennessee the Clinchport fault overrides and buries two thrust plates- the Wallen Valley and Hunter Valley. Maximum displacement is unknown, but locally movement has been as much as 6 miles. Structure of the southern Appalachian Mountains is dominated by a series of linear northeast-trending thrust faults. Several of these faults, such as the Salt\u00ad ville, Pulaski, and Great Smoky-Holston Mountain, are of great length and persist as entities for hundreds of miles from Virginia to Georgia. In contrast there are many shorter thrusts that begin and end in much less distance. In the past the Clinchport thrust has been assumed to be one of these shorter faults. As originally mapped by Campbell (1894, 1899) the Clinchport fault was shown both at Clinch port and Dungannon, V a., as a series of discontinuous en echelon thrust faults. Butts (1940, p. 460--461) accepted the discontinuous nature of the Clinchport fault, but suggested that it was linked to the St. Clair and Honaker faults and formed a con\u00ad tinuous fault zone 170 miles long in Virginia and West Virginia. In northeast Tennessee, Rodgers (1953a, fig. 5) interpreted the Clinchport as a minor fault within the Hunter Valley thrust plate. The Hunter Valley is the first extensive thrust northwest of the Clinchport, in southwest Virginia (fig. 1). Near the Tennessee and Virginia border just east of Sneedville, Tenn., Rodgers showed the Clinchport fault merging with the Hunter Valley; however, southwest of the point of merger, two large \"fault slices\" lie in front of his Hunter Valley fault. Rodgers (1953a, p. 131) suggested the possibility that the Hunter Valley and Clinch port faults might divide around these slices, but he surmised that the Hun-ter Valley was dominant because he discontinued the name Clinchport at the point of merger and referred to the fault throughout the rest of Tennessee as the Hunter Valley or Whiteoak Mountain thrust fault. In another paper (1953b, fig. 1) he postulated that the Hunter VaJ\u00ad ley-Whiteoak Mountain thrust is a principal fault that joins the St. Clair thrust in southwestern Virginia and West Virginia to form a continuous fault about 380 miles long from Virginia to Georgia. Mapping by Harris and Miller ( 1958, 1963) and Brent ( 1963) demonstrated that the Clinch port fault at Clinch port, V a., is not two minor en echelon thrust faults as shown by Campbell (1894); rather the Clinch\u00ad port is continuous throughout the Clinchport area. However, a relatively minor fault is present north of the Clinchport thrust in the adjacent Hunter Valley thrust plate (fig. 2). Similarly, recent reconnaissance map\u00ad ping near Dungannon, Va., by the author indicates that Campbell's interpretation of the discontinuous nature of the Clinchport thrust is incorrect. The Clinchport thrust plate is warped in the area where Campbell thought the fault died out or was interrupted. The warp caused the Clinchport fault to change its stra\u00ad tigraphic position from low in the Rome Formation (Lower Cambrian) to the basal part of the Rutledge Limestone (Middle Cambrian). By chance, north-dip\u00ad ping beds of the Rutledge in an anticline in the Clinch\u00ad port plate were brought in contact across the thrust plane with north-dipping beds of the Rutledge in a syncline in the Hunter Valley thrust plate-thereby producing a pseudo syncline-anticline couple (fig. 3). Campbell apparently observed this relationship and er\u00ad roneously assumed that the Clinchport fault was de\u00ad creasing in displacement and dying out in a fold. After tracing the Clinchport fault northeastward from Clinchport through the Dungannon area, the au\u00ad thor realized that northeast of Dungannon, as suggested U.S. GEOL. SURVEY PROF.

The trace of this major fault extends about 140 miles northeast of Dungannon through parts of West Virginia and finally dies out in an anticline in Alleghany County, V a. Recognition that the Clinchport is a major structural element in Virginia suggested to the author the possi\u00ad bility that in Tennessee the Clinchport fault overrode and buried the Hunter Valley fault plate, instead of merging with the Hunter Valley thrust as suggested by Rodgers (19\u00b753a, p. 131). According to such an inter\u00ad pretation, the two large areas referred to as \"fault slices\" i!1 the Hunter Valley plate by Rodgers would be rem\u00ad nants of that fault projecting from beneath the Clinch\u00ad port fault plate. Previous work by several geologists, including the author, in parts of Virginia and Tennessee has sug\u00ad gested that displacmnent along major thrust faults probably amounts to a number of miles. The displace\u00ad ment tends to obscure regional facies changes by bury\u00ad ing large segments of the section and by bringing into juxtaposition facies which accumulated in separate\u00b7 parts of the original basin of deposition. 'Thus, rocks of the same formation tend to show abrupt and marked changes in lithology and thickness in very short dis\u00ad tances from plate to plate. In contrast, rocks of the same formation commonly show gradual and progres\u00ad sive changes in lithology and thickness along strike within a fault plate. Both the marked local changes and the regional progressive changes are illustrated on figure 2 by rocks of the Conasauga Group in two 36\u00b0 45' 36\u00b0 Pumpkin Valley Shale B51 0 10 MILES H4 0. ~ 0 ~ ro DO ~ ro DO ~ ro (/) ro c 0 () FIGURE 2.-Index map and facies diagram of the area between Tazewell, Tenn., and Clinchport, Va.

Sawteeth are on the upper plate of the Clinchport fault of this report. thrust plates in the area between Clinch port, V a., and Tazewell, Tenn. In this area the Rutledge and Mary\u00ad ville Limestones show a progressive and orderly thin\u00ad ning to the southwest, and the intervening Rogersville Shale shows a corresponding thickening in both the Clinchport and Hunter Valley thrust plates. In con\u00ad trast, a comparison of stratigraphic sections across the plates normal to the thrust faults demonstrates that the limestones consistently thicken abruptly to the southeast in a relatively short distance (sections H3 and C4). The rocks in the two fault slices between Tazewell and Sneedsville (fig. 2) show a much greater similarity to the rocks of the Hunter Valley plate northeast of Sneedsville than to the rocks of the Cona\u00ad sauga Group exposed immediately to the southeast of the fault slices in the Clinchport fault plate. Consider\u00ad ing these data, the writer concludes that the rocks in the fault slices are isolated parts of the Hunter Valley plate projecting northwestward from below the main mass of the Clinchport plate. Thus, the Clinchport thrust is the major thrust in this area, which increased in displacement from northeast to southwest and over\u00ad rode and buried the Hunter Valley plate in the area between Sneedsville and Tazewell. About 35 miles southwest of the remnants of the Hunter Valley thrust sheet, Rodgers ( 1953a, p. 131) \u00b7 sug\u00ad gested that his Hunter Valley fault (the Clinchport fault of this paper) appeared to merge with the next fault to the north-the Wallen Valley (fig. 1). South\u00ad westward from the point of apparent merger he called HARRIS B53 the fault the Whiteoak Mountain. It seems unlikely that the Clinchport would override the intervening Hunter Valley sheet to merge with the next succeeding fault, the Wallen Valley. Rather it seems more likely that the Clinchport overrode and buried in turn the Hunter Valley and the Wallen Valley sheets. From the point of override the Clinchport (Whiteoak Moun\u00ad tain) can apparently be traced southwestward into the Taylor Ridge fault in north Georgia where it ends in an area of complex faulting. The existence and to a great degree the extent of the Clinchport fault and component segments (White\u00ad oak Mountain, Honaker, St. Clair, and Taylor Ridge) have been known since the late 19th century; however, lack of detailed information in key areas delayed recog\u00ad nition of the Clinchport thrust as a continuous major structural element in the southern Appalachians. The Clinchport thrust can be traced for about 380 miles through parts of West Virginia, Virginia, Tennessee, and Georgia. Along its course between West Virginia and Georgia it completely overrides and buries two thrust sheets. The total width of these buried sheets is on the order of 6 mi]es, which suggests a minimum displacement for the Clinchport fault. Certainly the Clinchport ranks with such other major thrust faults of the southern Appalachians as the Saltville and Pulaski. REFERENCES Brent, W.

GEOLOGICAL SURVEY 'RESEARCH 1965 CORRELATION OF CRETACEOUS AND LOWER TERTIARY ROCKS NEAR LIVINGSTON, MONTANA, WITH THOSE IN OTHER AREAS OF MONTANA AND WYOMING By ALBERT E. ROBERTS, Denver, Colo. Abstract.-Cretaceous and lower Tertiary rocks exposed in the vicinity of LivingSiton, in southwestern Montana, comprise a marine and continental sequence of sedimentary and volcanic rocks 17,000 feet thick. From recent studies of structure, facies relations, paleontology, and nomenclature, the following units (in ascending order) are correlated with rocks in other areas of Montana and Wyoming: Kootenai Formation, Thermopolis Shale, Mowry Shale, Frontier Formation, Cody Sbale, Telegraph Creek Formation, Eagle Sandstone, Cokedale Formation, Miner Creek Formation, Billman Creek Formation, Hoppers Formation, and Fort Union Formation. Lateral variation in lithology and thickness of roeks assigned to the Cretaceous and lower Tertiary of south\u00ad western Montana presents many problems in correlation. Brief deseriptions and a eorrelation ehart are presented here to summarize the writer's interpretation of these stratigraphie relations' of the Cretaeeous and lower Ter\u00ad the Livingston area, in southwestern Mon\u00ad tana, with other areas in Montana and Wyoming. REGIONAL STRATIGRAPHY OF CRETACEOUS AND LOWER 'TERTIARY ROCKS In Late Jurassie time, the Ellis sea that eovered most of Montana withdrew northward into northern Canada, and eontinental deposition prevailed into the Early Cre\u00ad taeeous. During this time of nonmarine deposition, the Upper J urassie Morrison Formation and Lnver Cretaeeous Kootenai Formation and their stratigraphie equivalents were deposited. Near the middle of the Early Cretaeeous the southward transgressing arctic sea again eovered most of Montana. The depositional his\u00ad tory during Colorado and Montana time along the west\u00ad ern edge of the Cretaeeous Interior basin of Montana includes several westward transgressive stages and several eastward regressive stages. Oseillations of the Cretaeeous epieontinental sea that formed these stages probably resulted from a gradual filling and sinking of the trough of the basin to the east. The lower and upper sandstone members of the Thermopolis Shale, the Frontier Formation, the Eldridge Creek Member of the Cody Shale, and the Eagle, Miner Creek, and Hoppers Formations or their stratigraphie equivalents represent the Cretaeeous regressions in southwestern Montana. In very Late Cretaeeous (post-Eagle) and Paleocene time the area north of the Beartooth Range and east of the Bridger Range gradually warped downward, form\u00ad ing the Cr~zy Mountains basin (fig. 1). STRATIGRAPHY OF CRETACEOUS AND LOWER TERTIARY ROCKS NEAR LIVINGSTON The Cretaceous System and Paleoeene of Late J urassie age.

The correlation and stratigraphic relations of the Cretaceous roeks of the Livingston area, Montana, with those of other areas in Montana and Wyoming are shown on figure 2.

The base of the Cretaceous sequence in the Living\u00ad ston area of southwestern Montana is marked by the massive bed of indurated chert pebbles newly assigned in this paper to the Pryor Conglomerate Member. The Pryor is the basal member of the Kootenai Formation and unconformably overlies the Upper Jurassic Mor\u00ad rison Exposures of the continental se\u00ad quence of the Kootenai Formation in the vicinity of Livingston suggest deposition over an extensive low\u00ad land bordered on the west by a highland area. Streams from the west during early deposition of the Kootenai dropped their sediment to create alluvial fans, channel sandstones, and flood-plain deposits. During the re\u00ad mainder of the deposition of the Kootenai the area was predominantly lacustrine, with deposition of very fine grained clastic sediments, predominantly of vol\u00ad canic origin, and a few limestones. The Kootenai is 245 to 295 feet thick, including the 24-to 37-foot Pryor Conglomerate Member. The Kootenai Formation at Livingston is probably equivalent to the Lakota Forma\u00ad tion of northeastern Wyoming and the Cloverly Forma-tion of south-central Montana and central Wyoming, where the name Cloverly is restricted to Cretaceous rocks (fig. 2). The Thermopolis Shale overlies the Kootenai Forma\u00ad tion and is subdivided into the lower sandstone member, middle shale member, and upper sandstone member. In areas of good exposures these members would be of formation rank; however, in the northern part of the Gallatin Range, valleys with very few outcrops are developed on these units. The Thermopolis Shale is 490 to 530 feet thick and is predominantly soft dark\u00ad gray to black marine shale with prominent sandstone ridges or ledges formed by the lower and upper members. The lower sandstone member rests unconformably on the Kootenai Formation, in many places filling depres\u00ad sions in its upper part. The hiatus between the Koo\u00ad tenai Formation and the lower sandstone member of the Thermopolis Shale is presumed to be small because the index fossil Protelliptio douglassi occurs immedi\u00ad ately above and below the widespread disconformity separating the two formations CW.

The lower sandstone member of the Thermopolis Shale is probably equivalent to the Greybull Sandstone and Rusty beds of north-central Wyoming, the Fall River Formation of the Black Hills area of northeast\u00ad ern Wyoming, and the Flood Member of the Blackleaf Formation of northwestern Montana (fig. 2). The middle shale member conformably overlies the lower sandstone member of the Thermopolis Shale. The middle shale member is a black marine shale rang\u00ad ing in thickness :from 350 to 390 :feet. The lower 100 :feet contains numerous thin beds of siltstone and very fine grained sandstone. The member contains a spore and pollen assemblage similar to that of the Skull Creek Shale of north-central Wyoming (G. 0. W. Kremp, written communication, 1960). The middle shale member is also correlative with the Taft Hill Member of the Blackleaf Formation of northwestern Montana (fig. 2). The upper sandstone member overlies the middle shale member, probably conformab ly. The upper sandstone member is a fine-grained arkosic sandstone with some interbedded shale in the middle part; it contains a large proportion of heavy minerals and in this it differs :from the lower sandstone member. It ranges in thickness from 90 to 105 feet, and generally only the lower part is exposed. Glauconite is present in the upper part of the upper sandstone member. The member is probably equivalent to the Muddy Sandstone Member. of north-central Wyoming, the Newcastle Sandstone of the Black Hills area of northeastern \u00b7wyoming, and the Vaughn Member of the Blackleaf Formation in northwestern Montana. The Mowry Shale conformably overlies the upper sandstone member of the Thermopolis Shale. The Mowry is a dark-gray to brownish-gray marine and nonmarine claystone with interbedded siltstone and sandstone throughout. Its thickness ranges from 430 to 500 feet. Septarian concretions are common in the lower part of the formation, and conspicuous greenish\u00ad gray claystone with red specks of heulandite is present in the upper 100 feet of the formation. The Mowry at Livingston is probably equivalent to the Bootlegger Member of the Blackleaf Formation in north western Montana. To distinguish the Thermopolis Shale :from the Mowry Shale in the Livingston area, emphasis may be given to lithology, fabric, and color. The Thermopolis is predominantly shale (fissile), while the Mowry is predominantly claystone ( nonfissile). Also, the Ther\u00ad mopolis Shale is dark gray, weathers to light gray, and is not very tuffaceous; on the other hand the Mowry Shale is brownish gray, weathers to yellowish gray, and is very tuffaceous. Porcelanitic sandstones are present only in the upper 200 feet of the Mowry. Upper Cretaceous formations The Upper Cretaceous Series near Livingston con\u00ad sists of the Frontier Formation, Cody Shale, Telegraph Creek Formation, Eagle Sandstone, Cokedale Forma\u00ad tion, Miner Creek Formation, Billman Creek Forma\u00ad tion, Hoppers Formation, and the basal part of the Fort Union Formation. The Upper Cretaceous Series is 10,830 feet thick, it consists of dark-gray shale with interbedded siltstone and sandstone in the lower part, and of clastic material derived from Precambrian meta\u00ad morphic and metasedimentary, Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary, and Cretaceous volcanic rocks in the upper part. Massive indurated ridge-forming sandstones of the Frontier Formation overlie the Mowry Shale and are probably conformable upon it. The boundary between the Mowry Shale and the Frontier Formation is the base of the lowest well-defined sandstone of the Boulder River Sandstone Member above the Mowry Shale. These sandstones contain an abundant heavy-mineral suite, and their general appearance is that of \"salt and pepper\" sands. The Frontier contains spores, pollen, and a few shallow-water mollusks (both marine and brackish-water :forms); its thickness ranges from 350 to 415 feet. East of the Livingston area, Richards (1957, p. 415) named a prominent 100-:foot-thick sandstone unit exposed along the west side of the Boulder River valley near McLeod, Mont., the Boulder River Sand\u00ad stone Member of the Colorado Shale. This unit, which represents the basal part of the Frontier Formation of the McLeod area and of adjacent areas, is here redesig\u00ad nated as the basal member of the Frontier Formation. At Livingston the Boulder River Sandstone Member is 120 :feet thick. At its top is an excellent persistent marker bed of mottled sandstone. The mottling is due to crystallization clusters of analcite in the cementing material, which give the weathered surface the appear\u00ad ance of a small-pebble conglomerate. Siltstone and shale with streaks of coal are present near the middle of the Frontier. Approximately 100 feet from the top of the Frontier is a persistent thin bed of chert-pebble con\u00ad glomerate. The Frontier Formation at Livingston is approximately equivalent to the Belle Fourche Shale of northeastern Wyoming (fig. 2). The Cody Shale overlies the Frontier Formation and is subdivided into three units, the lower shale member, the Eldridge Creek Member, and the upper shale mem\u00ad ber. The Cody Shale at Livingston is 1,285 to 1,375 feet thick and is predominantly a dark-gray marine shale. ROBERTS B59 Overlying the Frontier Formation, apparently con\u00ad formably, is 400 to 590 feet of clark-gray to dark-brown marine shale with interbedded siltstone throughout. This shale unit, the lower shale member of the Cody Shale, is correlative with the Greenhorn Formation, the Carlile Shale, and the lower part of the Niobrara For\u00ad mation of northeastern Wyon1ing (fig. 2). In the lower part of the lower shale !fiember is a persistent calcareous zone that is correlative with the Greenhorn Calcareous Member of the Cody Shale of south-central Montana. A persistent thin-bedded greenish-gray fine-grained sandstone named the Eldridge Creek Member of the Cody Shale (Roberts, 1964c) overlies the lower shale member with apparent conformity. This excellent marker bed contains a shallow-water marine middle Niobrara fauna (W. A. Cobban, written communica\u00ad tion, 1958) and is very glauconitic. The Eldridge Creek Member ranges in thickness from 90 to 120 feet. The upper shale member conformably overlies the Eldridge Creek Member and consists of 500 to 845 feet of dark-gray to bro~n marine shale and siltstone with interbedded very fine grained sandstone. The member gradually increases in total sand content in the younger beds. This upper shale member is correlative with the upper part of the Niobrara Formation of northeastern Wyoming (fig. 2). The Montana Group equivalent in the Livingston area consists of the Telegraph Creek Formation, Eagle Sandstone, Cokedale Formation, Miner Creek Forma\u00ad tion, Billman Creek Formation, and part of the Hoppers Formation. \u00b7The Telegraph Creek Formation is of shallow-water marine origin; the Eagle Sandstone is of littoral or brackish-water origin; and the Cokedale, Miner Creek, Billman Creek, and Hoppers Formations are predominantly of nonmarine origin. The Telegraph Creek Formation consists of thin beds of calcareous sandy siltstone and sandstone that contain abundant biotite and a heavy-mineral suite similar to that in the Eagle Sandstone. The Telegraph Creek is approximately 275 feet thick at Cokedale, Mont., 9 miles west of Livingston, and at Livingston it is 295 feet thick. Weed (1893, p. 16) referred to the steeply dipping small ledges in this part of his stratigraphic section at Coke\u00ad dale as the Tmnbstone Sandstone. In the Cokedale\u00ad Livingston area the Telegraph Creek Formation is tran\u00ad sitional in grain size between the very fine grained clastic material of the upper shale member of the Cody Shale and the fine-to medium-grained clastic material of the Eagle Sandstone. The base of the Telegraph Creek is generally covered by Quaternary deposits; in the few localities where the lower part of the formation is exposed, its contact with the Cody Shale is arbitrarily placed at the lowermost biotitic sandstone bed. 758-810 0 -65 - 5 The Eagle Sandstone conformably overlies the Tele\u00ad graph Creek Formation, and the boundary between the two formations is gradational. The Eagle consists of 515 to 860 feet (average about 600 feet) of sandstone with intercalated beds of coal and carbonaceous silt\u00ad stone. A massive, light gray, arkosic sandstone 110 feet thick at its base is called the Virgelle Sandstone Member. The coal beds, some of which are of commer\u00ad cial quality, are usually lenticular with rapid lateral changes; however, the zones in which they occur are laterally persistent (Roberts, 1957, p. 45). According to W. A. Cobban (written communication, 1961), faunas collected from the Eagle Sandstone 50 miles south of Livingston indicate that the top of the Eagle in this area is no younger\u00b7 than the lower part of the Eagle of central Montana and that an even older age is possible (fig. 2). Late in the Santonian Stage of Late Cretaceous time, epeirogenic arching began in western Montana, and the Eagle seas regressed to the east. This period of orogeny and erosion was accompanied by volcanism that formed the thick Elkhorn Mountains volcanic pile (Klepper and others, 1957, p. 31-41). Following with\u00ad drawal of the Upper Cretaceous Eagle seas in western Montana, the area east of the Bridger Range and north . of the Beartooth Range was gradually warped down\u00ad ward forming the Crazy Mountains basin. The Crazy :Mountains basin is elongated northwest and is approximately 40 to 10 miles wide and 130 miles long (fig. 1). The basin is asymmetrical, with more than 13,000 feet of sedimentary rock derived predomi\u00ad nantly from andesitic volcanic rock of the Elkhorn Mountains deposited in the deeper (western) part of the basin during the remainder of Upper Cretaceous and Paleocene time (Roberts, 1963, p. B86). The strat\u00ad igraphic sequence for this part of the basin indicates that deposition was continuous and that the rocks grade laterally to the east and northeast into finer grained marine and nonmarine beds. The nonmarine sequence near Livingston, Mont., has been subdivided into the Livingston Group, which includes the Cokedale, Miner Creek, Billman Creek, and Hoppers Formations of Late Cretaeeous age, and the Fort Union Formation of Late Cretaeeous and Paleocene age (Roberts, 1963). The Livingston Group represents rapid vertical and lateral variations in lithology commensurate with part of the Laramide orog-eny. The type Cokedale Formation is a nonmarine unit 1,550 feet thick comprised of siltstone and sandstone with lesser amounts of claystone, tuff, bentonite, and coal in the lower part. The Cokedale is correlated eastward with the Claggett Shale, the Judith River Formation, and the Bearpaw Shale, and in northwestern Montana B60 STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY AND STRATIGRAPHY with the Two Medicine Formation (fig. 2). The Coke\u00ad dale rests conformably on the Eagle Sandstone at the type section at Cokedale, Mont. The difference in the lithologies of the Eagle Sandstone (predominantly quartz grains) and the Cokedale Formation (predomi\u00ad nantly andesite fragments) is considerable. However, the boundary is not represented by an abrupt change in lithology. The contact is placed at the top of the ar\u00ad kosic sandstone that overlies the uppermost minable \u00b7 coal bed in the Eagle Sandstone (Roberts, 1963, p. B90). The Miner Creek Formation conformably overlies the Cokedale Formation. The type section is 1,350 feet thick. The Miner Creek consists largely of alternating beds of nonmarine siltstone and sandstone; the Sulphur Flats Sandstone Member, a 160-foot-thick unit that forms prominent ridges, is at its base. The Miner Creek Formation is correlated eastward with the lower part of the Hell Creek Formation, and the Sulphur Flats Sandstone Member is the nonmarine facies of the marine Lennep Sandstone and the Horsethief Sandstone (fig. 2). The type Billman Creek Formation is a nonmarine unit, 2,590 feet thick comprised of red, purple, and green tuff, bentonite, and claystone with a few intercalated beds of sandstone. Claystone constitutes about 65 per\u00ad cent of the formation; three samples of the claystone averaged 40 percent montmorillonite, 50 percent mixed\u00ad layer montmorillonite-illite-vermiculite, 5 percent illite~ and 5 percent chlorite (L. G. Schultz, oral communica\u00ad tion, 1962). A 20-foot continuous sandstone unit 96 feet above the base of the Billman Creek Formation con\u00ad tains abundant spherical ealeareous sandstone concre\u00ad tions, generally 1 to 2 feet in diameter, and is an excel\u00ad lent marker bed. The Billman Creek Formation is cor\u00ad related northward and eastward with the middle part of the Hell Creek Formation (fig. 2). The Billman Creek rests conformably on the Miner Creek Formation at the type section on Billman Creek, near Cokedale, Mont. The type Hoppers Formation is a nonmarine unit, 965 feet thick, comprised of sandstone and conglomerate with some interbedded siltstone, claystone, and tuff. The basal 140 is a conspicuous yel\u00ad lowish-gray, erossbedded, cliff-forming sandstone that is conglomeratic in many places. The sandstones are generally banded by layers of ferromagnesian minerals. The Hoppers Formation is correlated northward and eastward with the upper part of the Hell Creek Form3\u00b7 tion (fig. 2). Upper Cretaceous and Paleocene formation The Livingston Group at Cokedale, Mont., is over\u00ad lain by a nonmarine sequence of sandstone and conglom\u00ad erate alternating with siltstone and claystone which is 6,615 feet thick and is assigned to the Fort Union For\u00ad mation (fig. 3). The Fort \u00b7union includes three litho\u00ad logic units: a lower conglomeratic sandstone member 975 feet thick, a middle member of sandstone and claystone 3,840 feet thick, and an upper conglomeratic sandstone member 1,800 feet thick. There is an erosion surface at the top. Evidence from fossils, stratigraphic position, and tectonic history as interpreted from the types of rock in the unit indicates that the lower member is of Late Cretaceous age. Conglomerate in the Livingston Group consists ehiefly of Cretaceous volcanic-rock frag\u00ad ments, whereas igneous, and Meso\u00ad zoic formations. The position of the boundary between rocks of Late Cretaeeous and Paleoeene age is uneertain but may lie somewhere in the lower 800 feet of the middle member of the Fort 1Jnion, as these beds contain a flora shown by plant mierofossils to be transitional between Cretaceous and Paleocene (R. H. Tschudy, written com\u00ad munication, 1962). Approximately 3,100 feet above the base of the formation the writer eollected part of a jaw\u00ad bone with teeth that was identified by C. L. Gazin (writ\u00ad ten communication, 1958) as Tetraclaeonodon cf. sym\u00ad boUcu8 Gidley, a middle Paleocene fossil which has been deseribed from the Lebo Member of the Fort Union For\u00ad mation. Eocene formations The northern part of the Gallatin Range continued to undergo erosion during deposition of the Fort Union Formation in the southwestern part of the Crazy Moun\u00ad tains basin. Later this area was covered by Tertiary flows, flow breccias, and related sedimentary deposits. At the northern extent of these rocks, near Chimney Rock, Mont. (Roberts, 1964e); the post-Fort Union stratigraphic section consists predominantly of con\u00ad glomerates, flow breecias, agglomerates, and mud flows similar to the types of rocks deposited nearthe periph\u00ad ery of large voleanie piles. At the base of the section is 160 feet of cliff-forming coarse conglomerate com\u00ad posed predominantly of dacitic volcanic roek but with lesser amounts of Precambrian igneous metamor\u00ad roeks. A earbonaeeous claystone found locally at the base of this eonglomerate \u00b7 (W. J. MeMannis, written eommunication, 1962), eontains plant spores and pollen identified by R. H. Isehudy (written eommunication, 1962), as Wasatehian provineial age of Wood and others (1941) of the Eocene. The cliff-forming conglomerate is overlain by 60 feet of loosely consolidated, slope-form\u00ad ing eonglomerate that eontains only volcanic. rock (gen\u00ad erally andesitic) .

The Wasatchian provincial age of the claystone at the base of the section and petrographic comparisons of the over\u00ad lying rocks with those in the Absaroka Range indicate that the lower conglomerate is a lateral facies of part of the \"early acid breccia\" of Hague ( 1899) in the Ab\u00ad saroka Range or Reese Formation of Calvert (1912) in the southern part of the Gallatin Range, or the Cathe\u00ad dral Cliffs Formation of Pierce (1963) in the Clarks Fork area of northwestern Wyoming; and that the up\u00ad per conglomerate and overlying rocks are equivalent to the \"early basic breccia\" of Hague ( 1899) of Bridgerian provincial age of the northern Absaroka Rang_e and Yel\u00ad lowstone National Park area, Wyoming. B62 STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY AND STRATIGRAPHY Post-Fort Union tectonic history The Bridger Range on the west edge of the Crazy Mountains basin is the result of uplift and basinward (eastward) thrusting, and the Beartooth Range on the south edge is the result of uplift and basinward (north\u00ad eastward) thrusting. The uplift was gradual during deposition of the Livingston Group and Fort Union Formation, and the thrusting postdates these units. The Livingston area was relatively stable in comparison with the Bridger Range to the west and the Beartooth Range to the southeast. As the Bridger and Beartooth uplifts were forced basinward the area between Boze~ man and Livingston developed into an area of arcuate, northwest-trending, en echelon folds, each of which is convex toward the southwest and parallels the axis of the Crazy Mountains basin (Roberts, 1964a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and h). Folding in the Livingston area continued until the major anticlines became asymmetric, with the steeper dips on the southwest flanks. The Canyon Mountain anticline progressed until it became recum\u00ad bent on its southwest flank. The crustal forces continued until failure of the folds occurred and large thrust or high-angle reverse (de\u00ad pending on degree of dip) faults were developed in a similar en echelon arrangement paralleling the folds. Field relations of these faults suggest that deformation was shallow seated. The general clip on the plane of these faults was west or south, depending on proximity to the Bridger or Beartooth Ranges. Mapping of the southwest flank of the Canyon Mountain anticline indi\u00ad cated several pulses of thrusting with intervening periods of erosion (Roberts, 1964 a and b). Compressive forces continued to move the Bridger block eastward and the Beartooth block northward, and folding continued in the Livingston area but with less magnitude than previously. The thrust plates were folded at this time, changing the general dip of the fault planes to a basin ward or north-to-east direction. Extensive erosion accompanied the folding, and by Late Cretaceous time the Bridger and Beartooth uplifts were truncated to expose Precambrian rocks. The basal conglomerate of the Fort, lTnion Formation in the Liv\u00ad ingston area, which is of very Late Cretaceous age, con\u00ad tains rock fragments derived from Precambrian (in\u00ad cluding the Belt Series), Paleozoic, and Mesozoic rocks (Roberts, 1963, p.

GEOLOGICAL SURVEY RESEARCH 1965 AN UPPER CRETACEOUS DEPOSIT IN THE APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS Bv ROBERT H. TSCHUDY, Denver, Colo. A\u00b7bstraot.-Samples of a black sandy clay from the Appa\u00ad lachian Mountains region near Chambersburg, Pa., yielded a suite of Late Cretaceous pollen and spores. Evidence from known stratigraphic ranges of some forms and from the number and percentage of triporate pollen found indicates an extreme age range extending from early Turonian through middle Cam\u00ad panian, with a probable age for the deposit of late Turonian through early Campanian. The discovery is approximately 80 miles west of the nearest known Upper Cretaceous outcrop. Preliminary palynological examination of a sample of black sandy clay submitted by IC. L. Pierce from the vicinity of Chambersburg, Pa., indicated a Late Creta\u00ad ceous age. The discovery, approximately 80 miles west of the nearest known Upper Cretaceous outcrop, neces\u00ad sitated further confirmation. R. M. Kosanke, of the lT.S. Geological Survey, obtained six additional samples from separate parts of the original mine dump. All the samples provided by Kosanke yielded pollen and spore assemblages almost identical in composition with the assemblage in the original sample and with each other. The dominant element of the spore and pollen flora is bisaccate coniferous pollen with probable podocarpa\u00ad ceous affinities. Secondary elements are monosulcate, probably araucarian pollen; and fern spores including representatives of the genera Oica.tricosiYporites and Appendici,sporites. Angiosperm pollen of the tricol\u00ad pate and tricolporate types is common, and triporate pollen is rare. The palynological taxa discussed in this account are a small pa.rt of the complete assemblage. Thorough taxo\u00ad nomic treatment would involve description of some new taxa and emendation of others; the complete assemblage of more than 60 different palynomorphs will be the sub\u00ad ject of a taxonomic paper at a la.ter date. SOURCE OF MATERIAL All samples were obtained from an old mine dump, referred to hereafter as the Pond Bank deposit. The samples were uniform in appearance and consisted of a black, organic sandy clay. Lignite from the original mine cou]d not be obtained. The mine shaft is located 8 miles southeast of Chambersburg, Pa., 1,250 feet north of lat 39\u00b052'30\" N. and 11,150 feet west of long 77\u00b030' W. On the Scotland 7% minute quadrangle, Pennsyl\u00ad vania, the location is 2,600 feet S. 37\u00b0 W. of the lookout tower on Little Mountain. It is on the east side of the Greenwood-Mount Alto road, between the junction of the English Valley road and the Pennsylvania Railroad crossing, and is 1.6 miles south of Greenwood and U.S. Route 30. METHODS The exterior of large consolidated pieces of the sam\u00ad ples was removed to lessen the possibility of contam\u00ad ination by recent pollen. The material was then broken up and treated with 10-percent potassium hydroxide, followed by heavy-liquid flotation with zinc bromide. No modern contaminants were observed in any of the preparations. STRATIGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF FOSSILS Some of the more significant plant microfossils found in the Pond Bank \u00b7ma.terial are shown on figure 1. The forms figured provide the principal basis for the age de\u00ad termination. The knowledge of the known stra.ti\u00ad graphic ranges of some of the forms discussed below has been supplemented by unpublished da.ta accumulated in the U.S. Geological Survey palynological laboratory at the Denver Federal Center. Appendieisporites (fig. 1, a) has not been reported from any post-Cretaceous rocks in the United States. It is, however, commonly present in both the Upper and Lower Cretaceous (Barremian according to Bren\u00ad ner, 1963; Coniaeian-Maestrichtian according to un\u00ad lJ.S. Geological Survey data). Although Weyland and Krieger ( 1953) state that this form genus is known only from the Late Cretaceous, Couper (1958) reports it from the Wealden (Early Cretaceous), and Lantz ( 1958) from the Purbeckian (Late Jurassic). Somewhat similar spores belonging to the genus Oica\u00ad tricosisporites occur in both the Cretaceous and Terti\u00ad ary. The species shown on figure 1,b is Oica.tricosispo\u00ad rites cf. 0. subrotund'WJ Brenner 1963.

The genus Parvisaccites, represented by figure 1, c, is a coniferous pollen type which is common in the Pond Bank deposit. This genus was originally described by Couper ( 1958) from the \"vVealden and Aptian\" of Brit\u00ad ain. A similar form Dacrydiu1npollenites was reported from the Tuscaloosa Formation (Groot and others, 1961). Leopold and Pakiser ( 1964) report Parvisac\u00ad cites from 1963) found it in almost every polleniferous sample from the Potomac Group in Maryland; and I have seen it in the Magothy Formation (Coniacian) in Maryland, the Ripley Formation (Campanian to Maestrichtian) in Kentucky and Tennessee, in the Clayton Formation (Paleocene) in Kentucky and Tennessee, but not above the Clayton. Thus the range of this pollen type in the eastern United States extends from the Lower Creta\u00ad ceous into the Paleocene. Araucariacites, represented by figure 1, d, is limited to the Cretaceous within the Mississippi embayment re\u00ad gion. East of the Mississippi embayment, Brenner (1963) found this genus in the Arundel and Patuxent Formations (Barremian to Aptian) but in greater abun\u00ad dance in the Patapsco Formation (Albian according to Brenner). Leopold and Pakiser (1964) have found it in the Tuscaloosa Group (Cenomanian to Turonian) and in the McShan Alabama B66 PALEONTOLOGY (Turonian to Coniacian) . I have found it in the Coffee Sand and in the Ripley and Owl Creek Formations but not above them. In the eastern United States this genus seems to be limited to the Cretaceous. Figure I, e and/, shows hisaccate pollen with rugulate crests of the Podocarpus type. The form genus is Rugubivesiculites. This genus has been reported from the following Cretaceous units in the United States: The Dakota Sandstone of Minnesota (Pierce, I96I) ; the Tuscaloosa and Magothy Formations of the Eastern United States (Groot and others, I96I); the Tuscaloosa Group and Eutaw and McShan Formations of Alabama (Leopold and Pakiser, I964); the Frontier Formation of Wyoming; 1 and the Eagle Ford Shale of eastern Texas (Brown and Pierce, I962). The genus occurs in samples from the type locality of the Magothy For\u00ad mation of Maryland, and from the Ripley Formation of Tennessee. In Tennessee and Kentucky this form is present in the Upper Cretaceous, hut it has not been found in the overlying Tertiary. The distinctive monosulcate group with small vesicles, Granabivesicul ites? (fig. I, ,q), has been reported here\u00ad tofore only by Pierce (I96I) from the Dakota Sand\u00ad stone (Cenomanian -Coniacian? according to Pierce) of Minnesota. Pierce erected three generic names for this group: Granabivesiculites, BacubivesicuUtes, and Ola\u00ad 'oabivesiculites. The swellings or at each side of the sulcus suggest aJfinity to the conifers with more fully developed bladders. This fossil type is rare in the Ripley Formation of Tennessee and Kentucky. In the Pond Rank material it is one of the common genera; at least three distinct species are reeogni;;:able. The most common angiosperm pollen type in the Pond Bank material is represented by figure I, h ( Rhoipites sp.). It is a tricolporate pollen with a well-developed coarse reticulum. A form which is similar, if not iden\u00ad tical, is common in the Magothy Formation at its type locality in Maryland. The same species occurs rarely in the Ripley Formation of the Mississippi embayment region. This form has not been observed above the Cretaceous. The triporate pollen species with endoplicae (Plica\u00ad pollis sp.) shown on figure I, i has not been reported previously from the United States. It is present in preparations from the type locality of the Magothy For\u00ad mation and in both Upper Cretaceous and lower Ter\u00ad tiary rocks of the Mississippi embayment region. The triporate genus Proteacidites (fig. 1, j) is a nu\u00ad merically minor constituent of the Pond Bank assem\u00ad blage. Proteacidites in the United States has been found in the Upper Cretaceous and Eocene rocks but not 1 C. F. Upshaw, 1959, Palynology of the Frontier Formation, north\u00b7 western Wind River Basin, Wyoming: Missouri Unlv. thesis. in the Paleocene. It has not previously been reported from any Cretaceous localities in the Eastern United States, but I have found it in the Ripley Formation in Kentucky and in the Cusseta Sand of Alabama. The range of the genus Proteacidites is based on too few oc\u00ad currences to ascribe a post-Santonian age to the Pond Bank pollen and spore flora with confidence. The evolutionary stage in the diversification of angio\u00ad sperm taxa provides a second line of evidence bearing on the age of the Pond Bank deposit. It is well known that rapid diversification of the pollen of angiosperms is characteristic of the Late Cretaceous. Among angio\u00ad spermous pollen types the triporates are probably of the greatest stratigraphic significance (Groot and others, I96I; Pflug, I953). The number and percentage of triporate pollen species present in a sample provide a clue to the approximate stratigraphic position of the sample in the Upper Cretaceous sequence. Unfortun\u00ad ately, palynological data for the Eastern United States are very limited, and no early Campanian or Santonian data are available. The number of triporate species present in a sample ranges from zero in the Albian (Brenner, 1963) and Cenomanian (Pierce, I96I) to at least 50 in the Ripley Formation of late Campanian to early Maestrichtian age. In the accompanying table, I have listed the number of triporate taxa found in Upper Cretaceous samples from the Eastern United States, and have shown the relation of triporates to the total pollen and spore as\u00ad semblage, expressed as percentages. Both the num~er and percentage of triporates in a sample decrease with the age of the sample. In the Pond Bank material, triporate pollen is rare, amounting to less than 0.5 percent of the total plant microfossils present. Only 6 species, including norma\u00ad polles types of Pflug, were found in the entire blage. This paucity of triporate pollen certainly elim\u00ad inates the Maestrichtian and late Campanian from consideration and suggests an age considerab le older (see table) . AGE Figure 2 charts the stratigraphic ranges, in the East\u00ad ern United States, of some of the genera and groups found in the Pond Bank material. The presence of angiosperm pollen indicates an age no older than Albian (late Early Cretaceous). No unequivocally angiosperm pollen has been reported from pre-Albian rocks any~ where in the world. The presence of the gymnosperm genera Rugubivesiculites, Araucariacites, genus Appendici\u00ad sporites, dates this deposit as older than Tertiary. The TSCHUDY B67 presence of triporate pollen indicates an age no older than Turonian.

Dashed lines indicate possible but un\u00ad proved age ranges. The paucity of triporate angiosperm pollen in both numbers and species contrasts sharply with the diver\u00ad sity and abundance of triporate angiosperm pollen in the Ripley Formation (late Campanian and early Maes\u00ad trichtian). This indicates that the Pond Bank material is older than late Campanian. The extreme age limits of the Pond Bank material must then be early Turonian and middle Campanian. The evidence from the number of triporate pollen taxa found suggests a probable Turonian to Coniacian age, which, in the absence of data from the Santonian, must remain under consideration. The evidence from the genus Proteacidites is contradictory. In the East\u00ad ern United States this genus is not known from below the Cusseta Sand (Campanian). I believe, however, that further work will reveal its presence in older Cre\u00ad taceous strata in this region. The evidence presented by the genus Proteacidites, indicating a Campanian or younger age, is contradicted by the abundance a.nd variety of the Granabivesiculites group, which suggest a Cenomanian to Coniacian age. Although the Granabivesiculites group ranges from Cenomanian through Maestrichtian, its occurrence is very rare above the Coniacian . The composition of the Pond Bank pollen and spore flora as a whole most closely resembles the flora seen in samples from the Magothy Formation and the Eutaw and McShan Formations. The known ranges of the palynomorphs discussed, the early evolutionary stage represented by the triporate angiosperm assemblage, and the similarity of the as\u00ad a whole to Eutaw and Magothy assem\u00ad blages, rather than to younger or older assemblages, leads me to place the Pond Bank material in the interval represented by the late Turonian through early Campanian.

GEOLOGICAL SURVEY \u00b7RESEARCH 1965 CLASSIFICATION OF THE SUPERFAMILY HEALDIACEA AND THE GENUS PSEUDOPHANASYMMETRIA SOHN AND BERDAN, 1952 {OSTRACODA) By I. G. SOHN, Washington, D.C. Abstract.-The shape of the carapace, the muscle-scar pat\u00ad tern . and the inferred nature of the soft parts of the fossil superfamily Healdiacea suggest that it does not belong to the suborders Platycopina and Metacopina but should be referred to the order Podocopida. On the basis of muscle-scar pattern the genus Pseudophanasymmetria is assigned to the superfamily Healdiacea. The diagnosis of this genus is emended to dimorphism, and Pseudophanasymmetria? afoveata is dimorphic form of P. toveata. Living ostracodes are identified in part by the struc\u00ad ture of the valves that completely enclose the soft parts, but mostly on detailed study of the appendages. Fossil ostracodes are classified solely on the morphology of the valves. With few exceptions, extinct genera and families are readily distinguished by study of the shell structures; however, the ordinal classification of fossil groups and its incorporation in the scheme for living forms is difficult. This paper discusses some criteria deduced 'from fossil ostracode shells that aid in the neontological classification of the Healdiacea.

Di\u00ad morphism was not mentioned in the description of the superfamily. Moderate sexual dimorphism was, how\u00ad ever, inferred for most of the genera in the family Healdiidae. The stratigraphic range was given as Devonian to Lower Cretaceous. The Late Cretaceous (Maestrichtian) genus Pseudo\u00ad phanasymmetria Sohn and Berdan, 1952 (type species Phanassymetria foveata van Veen, 1936) was originally assigned to the Bairdiidae? ( Sdhn and Berdan, 1952, p. 10). Later (Moore, 1961, p. Q208), the genus was referred to the Bairdiacea, family uncertain, and Coryell (1963, p. 68, 1120) referred to this genus as \"Uncertain, probably Macrocyprididae.\" Current studies on the relationship of post-Paleozoic ostracodes with their Paleozoic ancestors indicate that Pseudophanasymmetria, might more properly be re\u00ad ferred to the Healdiacea, and that the superfamily Healdiacea should not be referred to the suborders Me\u00ad tacopina or Platycopina. Griindel (1964) described the family Pseudohealdiidae for healdiids with a reduced number of individual scars in the adductor muscle-scar complex. According to his diagnosis, members of Pseudoheal\u00b7 diidae have seven or fewer relatively large oval scars that may be surrounded by additional smaller scars. Working with Early Jurassic specimens, he traced the reduction in the number of individual scars from aggre\u00ad gate numerous scars in Ogmocorwha through seven scars of what he called a cytherellid shape in Pseudohealdia (Ledahia) Griindel, 1964, to five scars of a darwinulid shape in Pseudohealdia (Pseudohealdia) Griindel, 1964, (fig. 1) and concluded that Healdiacea properly belongs in the Platycopina. Van Morkhoven (1962, p. 104) suggested a similar classification for the Healdi\u00ad acea. Triebel had earlier ( 1950, p. the e f g \" a FIGURE 1.-Muscle-scar pattern of several representatives of Healdiacea.

Griindel (1964) illustrated a transitional series of ad\u00ad ductor muscle scU~rs from typical healdiid thr\u00b7ough cytherellid to darwinulid, all based on specimens from the Liassic. This does not demonstrate a phylogenetic sequence; it merely suggests a group of pre-Liassic an\u00ad cestors. This sequence is pertinent to the present dis\u00ad cussion because of the similarity of the muscle-scar pattern of Pseudohealdia ( T.edahia) (fig. 1, e) to the muscle-scar pattern of Pseudophanasymmetria (fig. 2, b), suggesting the probable superfamily classification of the latter genus. -~ \\ \\ a b FIGURE 2.-Pseudophanasymmetria toveata (van V een, 1936) . a, complete carapace, dorsal view, approximately X from radiograph, approxi\u00ad mately X113.

Mestrichtian, S:outh Limburg, the Netherlands, paratype, USNM 108232. From Sohn and Berdan, 1952, text figs. 3, 5. The removal of the Healdiacea from the suborder Metacopina is reasona.ble, but classifying the Healdiacea in the Platycopina (Platycopida Sars of Sohn, 1961, p. 109) raises several objections. The muscle-scar pattern of the Healdiacea consists of an adductor complex ( cen\u00ad tral muscle scars of van Morkhoven, 1962, p. 47) and one or more accessory scars (frontal scars of van Mork\u00ad hoven, 1962, p. 48). Frontal scars have not been re\u00ad corded in the Platycopina. The Platycopina are of ap\u00ad proximately equal height at the ends in lateral outline, presumably to accommodate the well-developed terminal end with its platy \u00a3urea in the posterior and the stubby biramous second antenna in the anterior portion. Heldiids usually have unequal ends with a lower poste\u00ad rior portion. This suggests a rudimentary styliform \u00a3urea, like that of the Podocopida, or longer frontal appendages. I indicated the importance of the type of \u00a3urea and frontal appendages (second antenna) in the ordinal classification of living Ostracoda (Sohn, 1961, p. 109), but did not emphasize the fact that these termi\u00ad nal appendages are probably some of the more phylo\u00ad genetically stable features of the group. The Healdia\u00ad cea usually have spines or vertical ridges near the posterior; the Platycopina do not have such structures. The Platycopina may have marginal rims ( Oytherel\u00ad loidea) ; the Healdiacea do not. The overlap of the Platycopina is right valve over left; that of the Healdia\u00ad cea is left valve over right. Hartmann's suggestion (1963, p. 23 and following) that the Platycopida, in which he includes the Metaco\u00ad pina, are ancestral to the modern Podocopida, and that divergence must have occurred during or before the Ordovician, may be partly correct. Samabella Roundy, 1926 (Palaeocopida, Kloedenellocopina fide Moore, 1961, p. Q187) and an undescribed marine Middle Triassic genus (Sohn, 1963, p. C58) have an aggregate muscle\u00ad scar pattern of the healdiid type (fig. 1,b) that resembles the muscle scar of the Devonian species of Quasillites (Moore, 1961, p. Q379, text fig. 298, fig. 2). Quasillites Coryell and Malkin, 1936 ( Quasillitacea, Metacopina fide Moore, 1961, p. Q374) has a tripartite hinge and a ventrally truncated posterior, both characteristic of the Podocopida. The Healdiacea may be considered as an independent lineage, starting in or before the Devonian and extend\u00ad ing to at least the Late Cretaceous. For the reasons enumerated above, the Healdiacea should be considere d as distinct from the Pln.tycopida. On the basis of these considerations the classification below is suggested for the Healdiacea and the genus Pseudophanasymmetria. SOHN B71 SUGGESTED CLASSIFICATION FOR THE HEALDIACEA AND THE GENUS PSEUDOPHANASYMMETRIA Orde-r Podocopida Sars, 1865 The reference of the order Podocopida to Miiller, 1894, stems from the fact that both the Russian treatise (Chernysheva, 1960) and the American treatise (Moore, 1961) :followed Pokorny (1953, p. 221, 231) in classify\u00ad ing the suborders Podocopa Sars, 1865, and Platycopa Sars, 1865, in the order Podocopida. I have discussed this classification ( Sohn, 1961, p. 109) and pointed out that because of the marked differences in the structure of the appendages and body of the two groups, they should both be given ordinal status. The reason that Muller, 1894, is credited with the com\u00ad bined taxon is that he used clude Sars' two Al\u00ad though Sars ( 1865) is usually listed under the year 1866, I follow Sars (1922, p. 2, 1928, p. VIII) who recorded the publication as 1865. The fact that this publication is included in the Zoological Record for the year 1865 is additional evidence that the paper was published in 1865. Suborder unknown As stated above, the superfamily Healdiacea has been classified in the suborder Chernysheva, 1960), in the Moore, , and the suborder Platycopina (van Morkhoven, 1962, and Griindel, 1964). The reasons for removing this superfamily from the Metacopina and the Platycopina were previously The muscle-scar pattern of the Healdiacea dif\u00ad fers radically from the patterns known in the other superfamilies in the suborder Podocopina, except pos\u00ad ~ibly that ineluded in the Healdiacea (Mandelstam, in Cherny\u00ad sheva, 1960, p. 337). Pending additional information it is considered best to leave the subordinal classification of the superfamily in doubt. Superfamily Healdiacea Harlton, 1933, emend. Grunde.l, 1964 The original definition of the Healdiacea should be modified to include dimorphic forms and to exclude the families Darwinulidae and Scrobiculidae. Swain (in Moore, 1961, p. superfamily winulacea for this fresh-and brackish-water was questionably assigned to the superfamily Kirkbyacea by Moore (1961, p. Q168), although Sohn (in Moore, 1961, note under Placideidae) disagreed with that assignment. This family differs from the Healdiacea in that the genera referred to it are reticulate or punctate and have equal ends in lateral outline. Family unknown Pseudophanasymmetria does not fit into Griindel's family Pseudohealdiidae because of the 8 muscle scars in the adductor muscle-scar pattern, the greater asym\u00ad metry o:f the valves, and the simple hinge. The genus does not belong to the Krausellidae (Healdiacea ~'Meta\u00ad copina fide Moore, 1961, p. Q371) because the posterior end of neither valve is produced as a spine. It is ex\u00ad cluded from the Macrocyprididae (Bairdiacea, Podo\u00ad copina, Podocopida) by presence of a straight dorsal margin, absence of duplicature, and different muscle\u00ad scar pattern. The description of a new family for this genus is deferred until more information becomes avail\u00ad able.

In the orig\u00ad inal paper Sohn and Berdan referred afoveata van V een, 1936, to Pseudophanasymmetria questionably bec.ause of the absence of the curved ridge on the larger valve (fig. 2, a). Both species are from the same collection, and it is now apparent that the dif\u00ad ference between them is due to a type of dimorphism common to many groups of ostracodes. VanVeen dis\u00ad cussed the presence of a minute dorsoposterior spine that is not visible on her illustrations nor on the para-B72 PALEONTOLOGY types available for study.

GEOLOGICAL SURVEY RESEARCH 1965 STRATIGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF THE LATE CAMBRIAN MOLLUSK MATTHEVIA WALCOTT, 1885 By ELLIS L. YOCHELSON, j. F. McALLISTER, and ANTHONY RESO,' Washington, D.C., Menlo Park, Calif., Houston, Tex. Work done partly in cooperation with the California Division ot Mine.~ and Geology Abstract.-Spedmens of Matthevia, a genus that bas defied precise classification , are widespread in the Western United States. Characteristical ,ly they are silicified and may be identi\u00ad fied on the outcrop by the presence of two narrow deep cavities in a solid subpyramidal mass. The genus seems to be confined to rocks of Late Cambrian Trempea leau age. In 'the Funeral Mountains of the Death Valley region, California, and in the Pabranagat Range of southern Nevada, extensive fieldwork has demonstrated the stratigraphic utility of Matthevia in correlat\u00ad ing sections of complexly faulted rocks. Except for this fossil, the rock sequences studied are poorly fossiliferous and other\u00ad wise difficult to correlate. The enigmatic fossil 111 atthevia Walcott, 1885, was first described from the Late Cambrian Hoyt Lime\u00ad stone Member of the Theresa Dolomite near Saratoga Springs, N.Y. Specimens consist of a massive sub\u00ad pyramidal moderately narrow calcareous piece, in which are two elongate cavities, separated by a wide internal septum. Most specimens are more than 2 cen\u00ad timeters long. Although ViTalcott recognized the morphologic peculiarities of this genus, he thought that it had a single-piece shell, and as a matter of conven\u00ad ience he placed it w1der the \"pteropod\" gastropods. The type lot was refigured twice more by Walcott, but no additiona l descriptive work was done. The Hoyt Limestone Member is now conventionally placed in the Trempealeau Stage of the Upper Cambrian and dated by the occurrence of other fossils, particularly trilo\u00ad bites, in the fauna. In recent years, new occurrences of Matthevia have been found outside the type area. Indeed, the genus is now known from such widespread areas in the vVest\u00ad ern United States that it is assuming the status of a useful guide fossil to the Trempealeau. The rocks 1 Stall' Research Geologist , Tenneco Oil Co., Box 2511, Houston , Tex. from which it has been collected are mainly unfossilif\u00ad erous and without the occurrence of this fossil their ' . sequence would constitute something of a problem m precise age determination and correlation- All the western specimens are silicified (fig. 1), and they are relatively easy to recognize in the field as they commonly etch out in partial relief from the limestone or dolomite matrix; many are rusty brown when weathered. The majority of the specimens are worn; the occurrence of the two cavities in the fossil provides shell areas particularly susceptible to erosion. A col\u00ad lection will thus provide specimens of several different shapes and sizes. Some specimens may be worn so that only one cavity is preserved; others are worn to a saddle shape, and at one locality a few of the specimens have been so strongly modified that they superficially re\u00ad semble amphineuran plates like Pmcochiton Billings. Nevertheless, the effects of this prefossilization modi\u00ad fication are immediately obvious and the specimens may be readily identified in the field. In every collection at least one specimen shows a deep narrow cavity within the mass of silica, and commonly there are specimens which show the two characteristic cavities. Although there is a danger of confusing incomplete specimens with small chert nodules, the regular external form of M atthevia can be recognized, with a little experience, in even severely worn specimens. In spite of the extensive wear of many specimens, there are some specimens on which growth lines and relatively delicate details are preserved, indicating that the specimens are virtually complete. The large bulk of specimens, and particularly the better preserved ma\u00ad terial, suggests an alternative zoological placement to that of the \"pteropods.\" There appear to be subpyram\u00ad idal masses of two slightly different shapes, though U.S. GEOL.

It may be that these two parts are the anterior and posterior of the same animal. The mode of preser\u00ad vation of both calcareous and silicified specimens and the presence of growth lines strongly suggest that Mat\u00ad thevia is a mollusk. The morphology of the hard part or parts is not typical of any of the known classes of mollusks, and the genus may be the sole representative of a class that has left no other traces. This matter is discussed in more detail elsewhere (Y ochelson, report in preparation) . Regardless of its zoological position, specimens of the genus are of considerable interest as stratigraphic guides. In the Funeral Mountains of the Death Valley region, California (fig. 2), where detailed mapping has been done by McAllister, Matthevia occurrences have been instrumental in interpreting some parts of the complex structure. The genus has proved equally use\u00ad ful to Reso in mapping the Upper Cambrian of the Pahranagat Range, Lincoln County, Nev. (fig. 2) and in correlating the thick sequence of virtually barren Upper Cambrian cherty dolomites within the range and with those in other areas.

Though the occurrences in these last two States are interesting in themselves, more in\u00ad formation is available about the far western localities. OCCURRENCE OF MATTHEVIA IN NEVADA AND CALIFORNIA In the Funeral Mountains, specimens of M atthevia occur in the Upper Cambrian Nopah Formation. Where the formation was measured in a continuously exposed section 1,720 feet thick (fig. 3, locality 1) north of Pyramid Peak, specimens were found only in the 280- foot dark-gray to 1nedium-dark-gray dolomite unit des\u00ad ignated n8 (fig. 4), somewhat above the middle of the formation. The measured section of the Nopah ex\u00ad tends from the underlying Racetrack Dolomite in the Middle and Upper Cambrian to the base of the Pogonip Group in the Lower Ordovician. The Nopah Forma\u00ad tion consists of alternating dark and light units sporadically chert-bearing dolomite above a conspicu\u00ad ously clastic, 36\u00b030' 0 116\u00b045' 5 MILES ]\"'IGURE 3.-0utline of the quadrangle, showing localities where JJI atthevia has been eolleded in the Funeral Mountains, 758-810 0-65 - 6 z .... < Q) 0 C\\1 :::!: Medium-gray dolomite; chert nodules from limestone, cherty Dark-gray dolomite; to medium-dark\u00ad gray dolomite; chert nod\u00ad ules 45 to 65 feet above base of unit, sparse in widely spaced higher beds Very light gray dolomite Dark-gray to light-brown siltstone, some shale, pre\u00ad part, with USGS FIGURE 4.-Stratigraphic column of the Nopah Formation in the Funeral Mountains, Calif.

B76 PALEONTOLOGY The sequence of gray dolomite units is interrupted near the top of the formation by a silty limestone unit (fig. 4, n13) , lithologically like the Pogonip 125 feet higher. The dark dolomite units where they are isolated by faults or alluvium are difficult to distinguish from each other and from dark units in the underlying 3,700 feet of section. M atthevia at several of these places is a key to the stratigraphy and to a better resolution of structure. The usefulness of M atthevia as a guide fossil of the Trempealeau Stage as far west as California is sup\u00ad ported by a gastropod fauna associated with it in unit n-8 of the Nopah Formation in the Funeral Mountains and gastropods in a correlative part of the formation in the Quartz Spring area (fig. 2) about 60 miles west\u00ad northwest. At localities 1 and 2 (fig. 3) in the Funeral Mountains, the fauna includes Strepsodiscus sp., Scae\u00ad vogyra sp., and M atherella. n. sp., the last two suggest\u00ad ing equivalence to the Potosi and Eminence Dolomites in the Upper Cambrian of Missouri. The gastropod fauna in the Nopah of the Quart,z Spring area, which also contains 8trep8odi8cu.cs and Malherella, is placed very high in the Upper Cambrian by Josiah Bridge (in McAllister, 1952, p. 10) on the basis of his compari\u00ad son with a fauna in the upper part of the Eminence Dolomite of Missouri and the Hoyt Limestone Member of the Theresa Dolomite of New York. Assignment of unit n8 to the Trempealeau Stage on this basis is in conformance also with the next faunas known below and above. About 800 feet lower in the Nopah, unit n1 contains Upper Cambrian trilobites and brachiopods (identified by A. R. Palmer, written communication, 1963) that occur in the Dunderberg Shale at Eureka, Nev. (Palmer, 1960, p. 56-57). About 710 feet above unit n8 and approximately 180 feet above the top of the Nopah, R. J. Ross, Jr., collected from the Pogonip north of Pyramid Peak a Lower Ordovician fauna that he assigns (written communication, 1963) to zone B of the Garden City Formation in lTtah (Ross, 1951, p. 29). The Pahranagat Range \"lT pper Cambrian sequence (Reso, 1963, p. 904-905) is generally similar to that of the Funeral Mountains. Beds of Franconian age con\u00ad taining Billingse7la and beds containing Early Ordo\u00ad vician trilobites about 400 feet above the base of the Pogonip Group are stratigraphically separated by about 2,400 feet of virtually unfossiliferous rocks (fig. 5). Beds containing the Trempealeauan M atthevia about 800 feet above the beds with Billing8eUa therefore form an important mapping zone. Here again, the speci\u00ad mens of llf atthevia are associated with algae and with small gastropods, tentatively identified as Sin1topea,, another characteristic Late Cambrian form. Moreover, M atthevia provides the only current evidence for the age of the base of the exposed section in the Arrow Canyon Range to the southeast (Langenheim and others, 1962) and for possible correlation of the Arrow Canyon section with sections in the Delamar Moun\u00ad tains (fig. 5). The discrete fault blocks and isolated outcrops in this part of the stratigraphic column em\u00ad phasize the local importance of the key horizon.

O'CONNOR, Denver, Colo. Work done in cooperation with the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission A_bstract.-A classification for quartz-rich igneous rocks based on feldspar ratios is designed to relate chemically similar plu\u00ad tonic and volcanic rocks. The plutonic rocks are named mod\u00ad ally, according to common geologic usage, and their normative mineralogy is calcul.ated and used as the basis for a system to classify volcanic rock norms. The rocks to which this classifi\u00ad cation may be applied should have more than 10 percent quartz. The rock names are characterized as fields on a triangular dia\u00ad gDam with percentage of Ab, Or, and An as the vertices of the triangle. Many rock classification schemes have been applied to igneous rocks. Ho\u00b7wever, few, if any, of these classi\u00ad fications take into account both the different methods of study of volcanic and plutonic rocks and the chemical similarities between igneous rocks of different crystal\u00ad lization history but common magmatic origin. Petro\u00ad graphic classifications generally fall into three types: modal, chemical, and modified chemical (for example, normative). Modal classifications are inadequate to de\u00ad scribe aph~nitic or glassy volcanic rocks. Chemical and modified chemical classifications are generally used to classify volcanic rocks. Because of differences in chemical composition of normative minerals in volcanic rocks and modal min\u00ad erals in plutonic rocks, ehemically similar volcanic and plutonic rocks end up in different groupings in many elassifieations. An abundance of petrographic classifi\u00ad cations, generally formulated without regard for the chemical variability of roek-forming \u00b7minerals, has given rise to a proliferation of names for individual rock specimens. The following names were derived for the same rock specimen (a volcanic rock from the Nevada Test Site) fron1 some of the commonly used rock classi\u00ad fieations: rhyodacite (Williams and others, 1954) ockolds, 1954) ( tT ohannsen, 1939; Petersen, 1961). In this report the author will present a scheme whieh attempts to blend the presently used classifications into a simple system capable of adequately deseribing both voleanic and plutonic rocks. This system uses the modal mineralogy of plutonic rocks and the normative min\u00ad eralogy of volcanic rocks, but allows direct comparison of the data gathered by these different methods. PROPOSED CLASSIFICATIONS The quartz-rich igneous roeks are those which have cmnpositions such that their normative (or modal) mineralogy may be closely represented by points in the Qtz-Or-Ab-An tetrahedron with more than 10 percent quartz. Most petrographic classifications take advan\u00ad tage of this compositional grouping and classify the silicic. igneous rocks by projecting their compositions on one or more faces of the tetrahedron. We, too, will utilize this grouping and the fact that a:bove 10 percent quartz the variation in quartz content is a negligible factor in determining the rock type. After it is estab\u00ad lished that more than 10 percent quartz is present in the rock, the parameters used for classification are Or, Ab, and An. This an1ounts to a projection of composi\u00ad tional points from within part of the tetrahedron onto the feldspar face of the tetrahedron. In order to establish an equivalence between the clas\u00ad sifieation diagrams for volcanic rocks and plutonic rocks, it is first necessary to define one of the two di\u00ad visions. Since modal data for plutonic rocks are abund\u00ad ant in the geologic literature and modal analysis is the most common method of defining these rocks, the plu\u00ad tonic elassifiea.tion is set up first (fig. 1) . This classi\u00ad fication is adapted from Nockolds (1954), Williams and others ( 1954), Tuttle and Bowen ( 1958), and other up\u00ad published classifications. While figure 1 is similar in appearance to figure 3 and bears some resemblance to Hietanen's ( 1961) classification, it is a modal and not a norn1ative classification.

The Ab-An ratio was determined from the plagioclase feldspar. The granite field of figure 1 comprises most of the lower part of the diagram along the Ab-potash feldspar join. In other classifications (for example, Nockolds, 1954) granite has been distinguished from quartz mon\u00ad zonite by the relative plagioclase content, no matter what the plagioclase composition. The presence or ab\u00ad sence of plagioelase in a rock with the chemical com\u00ad position of a granite is~ however, the main difference be\u00ad tween the subsolvus- and hypersolvus-granite of Tuttle and Bowen (1958). This criterion subdivides rocks formed from chemically identical magmas but with dif\u00ad ferent crystallization histories, not rocks formed from chemically different magmas. This statement is not an attempt to abrogate the part played by chemical compo\u00ad sition in forming the minerals of a particular rock; it merely points out that over the wide range of pressure-temperature conditions under which granitic rocks may form, chemical identity does not imply, a priori, min\u00ad eralogic identity. Plotted normative compositions of typical granite and \"quartz monzonite\" with plagio\u00ad clase less calcic than An25 fall in the same area of the Ab-An-Or triangle (fig. 2). The trondhjemite field is defined according to Gold\u00ad schmidt (1916) and Hietanen (1943). The of trondhjemite (Goldschmidt, 1922; Turner and Verhoogen, 1951) are sufficient reason for perpetuating the preexisting name for this rock type, although mineralogica1ly trondhje\u00ad mite is an extension of the granite clan. The rocks of the tonalite and adamellite groups of this classifieation are typieally richer in lime than the rocks of the granite group (see Larsen, 1948). In the n1odal classifieation these rocks are restricted to fields with modal plagioelase more ealcic than An25 The adamellite field includes both granodiorite and quartz-O'CONNOR An EXPLANATION o Granite + Quartz monzonite Granodiorite o Tonalite 20 80 Trondhjemite 40 60 0 0 60 ... 40 0 TONALIT~ o Granodior-ite I I 0 0 i/ I 0 0 0 I ADA~ELLITE I I I I I I I 80 I Quartz I 20 0+ 1 :._monzonite/ +I+ I . .. oo TRONDHJEMITE + Cb oO Cbog o o 0 0 f(5l o o oc{] o oS 0 0 \u00b0 0 t)O 20 40 60 80 FIGURE 2.-Nol'Illative feldspar ratios from silicic plutonic rocks.

The field boundaries have been drawn to maintain the equivalence between the normative fields of this diagram and the modal fields of figure 1. The fields are labeled for the plutonic rock type to emphasize this correspondence; for the equivalent volcanic rock types see figure 3. The symbols represent the rock type as deter\u00ad mined modally on figure 1. B81 monzonite. The name \"adamellite\" has been used in this sense to maintain parallelism with the dellenite field in the volcanic classification, which is explained below. one diagram and volume-percent ratios in the other have been taken into account. To define the normative volcanic fields, 125 plutonic .rocks were selected which had been analyzed both modally and chemically. After classification of the rocks by plotting their modal analyses on figure 1, the normative mineralogy of the plutonic rocks was calcu\u00ad lated and .the molecular ratios of Or-Ab-An plotted on figure 2. Field boundaries were drawn so that the rocks defined by the modal feldspar ratios of figure 1 were similarly defined by the normative feldspar ratios of figure 2.

The phenocryst mineralogy should be useful in defining some units with similar normative min\u00ad eralogy (for example, \u00b7with modal which plot in the quartz-monzonite field have normative mineralogies which coincide with the potash-rich granodiorites (fig. 2). For this reason it is suggested here, as by other authors (Wahlstrom, 1955), that a general term, del\u00ad lenite, is applicable to the volcanic equivalents of both granodiorite and quartz-monzonite. This general name \"dellenite\" does not abrogate the usefulness of the rock names \"rhyodacite\" and \"quartz-latite\" but indicates that the latter are less definitive. CALCULATION OF THE MOLECULAR NORM The use of this classification requires that the petrog\u00ad rapher calculate the normative feldspar composition of the rock to be classified. The author has expressed this normative mineralogy in molecular percent be\u00ad cause this simplifies most mineralogic applications in petrologic studies. The molecular percentage of a min\u00ad eral in a rock may be calculated in several ways, with different results, depending upon the conventions used in establishing the chemical formula of the mineral. For general calculation of norms, the author uses Barth's ( 1962) modification of the Niggli system but, since the three feldspars used in this classification have the same number of cations in their conventional for\u00ad mulas, a simple method of direct calculation from a table is possible (table 1). O'CONNOR B83 TABLE 1.-Guide for direct calculation of partial molecular norm [Based on chemical analysis in weight percent; adapted from Wahlstrom (1955)] 1 percent of- sphene, fluorite are calculated first (for example, 0.20 percent C02 in the analysis equals 0.20X 1.274 percent=0.25 percent CaO and 0.20X2.274 percent=0.45 percent CaC0 8). Sphene is calculated only if insufficient FeO is present to produce ilmenite. The CaO for calcite, apatite, sphene, and fluorite is subtracted from the total CaO in the analysis, and the weight percentages of Ab, Or, and An are calculated respectively, from N a20, K20, and the residual CaO. If the calculated feldspars do not exhaust the alumina or silica in the analysis, the normative feldspars are divided by their respective mo\u00ad lecular weights (Or=278.4, Ab=262.2, An=278.2} and recalculated to 100 mole percent. If-alumina is not present in enough quantity to allow all the K20, N a20, and CaO to form feldspars, anorthite is reduced in quantity until the alumina deficiency is removed. If all the anorthite is used up without removing this de\u00ad ficiency, albite is reduced in quantity until the alumina deficiency is removed. If the chemical analysis does not contain sufficient silica to produce the feldspars and 10 percent quartz, the rock will not fit into the classi\u00ad fication proposed here.

These rocks should properly be called rhyolite. They include the roeks of the Piapi Canyon Formation, the rhyolites of Fortymile Canyon, the rhyolites of Sho\u00ad shone Mountain, rhyolites of the Calico Hills, the rhyolite ash-flow tuffs of the Thirsty Canyon Tuff, and the rhyolite lava-flows of Pillar Spring. Intermediate silicic rocks such as the sequence at W ahmonie Flat and Mount Salyer have norms which fall in the dacite, rhyodacite, and quartz latite fields. Probably the ma\u00ad jority of the rocks of the sequence at Wahmonie Flat and Mount Salyer belong in the rhyodacite category. This report has offered a classification for those igne\u00ad ous rocks which have a chemical composition in the silicic (more than 10 percent quartz) portion of the Qtz\u00ad Or-Ab-An tetrahedron. Many of the rocks lying near the low-siliea (less than 10 pereent quartz) portion of this tetrahedron can be classified by a similar diagram. However, abundant iron with its variable oxidation states, and the presence of different modal and norma\u00ad tive feldspathoids, makes direct comparison between plutonic and volcanic rocks of low silica content more difficult. This problem is left for further study. REFERENCES Barth, T. F. W., 1962, Theoretical petrology: New York, John Wiley and Sons, Inc. Goldschmidt, : Geol.

Work done in cooperation with the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission Abstract.-Silicic glass from the Gold Flat Member is chemi\u00ad cally very similar to pantellerite glasses from the island of Pantelleria. The analysis shows very high percentages of Na, Fe, Zr, Cl, and F and very low percentages of AI, Ca, and Mg. The minor elements B, Be, Nb, Pb, Sn, Th, the rare alkalis, and the rare earths are 5 to 30 times more abundant than in typical granitic rocks. Remarkably diverse suites of volcanic rock were erupted from a number of centers in southern Nye County, Nev., during the late Miocene and Pliocene (Noble and others, 1965). Alkalic and peralkalic rocks were erupted from two of the centers, the Black Moun\u00ad tain center (Christiansen and Noble, 1965) of middle Pliocene age, and an unnamed older center located 20 miles east of Black Mountain. The purpose of this pre\u00ad liminary note is to document an unusual silicic rock of extreme composition which was erupted from the Black Mountain volcano. GEOLOGY The Gold Flat Member crops out over an area of approximately 300 square miles centered on Black Mountain (fig. 1). The member is the fourth in the sequence of five ash-flow units of the Thirsty Canyon Tuff (Noble and others, 1964) which were erupted from the Black Mountain volcano. It is a compound cooling unit (Smith, 1960) made up of at least a dozen individ\u00ad ual ash flows. The source of the member is now rep\u00ad resented by an ovoid collapse caldera 3lf2 miles in maxi\u00ad mum diameter centered 1 mile west of Black Mountain. The original volume of the unit was between 2 and 5 cubic miles, only a fraction of which is now preserved. The other members of the Thirsty Canyon Tuff are of comenditic, were erupted from the Black Mountain volcano interfinger with the Thirsty Canyon Tuff near Black Mountain. PETROGRAPHY AND MINERA'LOGY The Gold Flat Member varies from densely welded to partially welded. Eutaxitic structure is readily seen at most outcrops. Although the groundmass of most rocks is devitrified to a fine-grained intergrowth composed mainly of alkali feldspar and cristobalite and (or) quartz, a thin basal vitrophyre is present at most outcrops. Phenocrysts, most of which are fractured portions of original euhedra, compose from 10 to 25 percent of the rock. Alkali feldspar makes up 80 to 90 percent of the phenocrysts, quartz 4 to 12 percent, sodic plagioclase 1 to 4 percent, and olivine, clinopyroxene, amphibole, and iron ore 0.5 to 2 percent each. Biotite, zircon, apatite, and chevkinite are present in trace amounts. Only pre\u00ad liminary optical, X-ray, and analytical work has been done on the phenocrysts. Complexly twinned euhedra of lime anorthoclase rimmed by a thin shell of soda\u00ad rich sanidine 1 to 2 centimeters in length make up about 20 percent of the alkali feldspar. The remainder con\u00ad sists of soda-rich sanidine crystals with a maximum diameter of about 5 millimeters. The olivine pheno\u00ad crysts range in composition from Fo5 varia\u00ad tions in refractive index and pleochroism also suggest a range in the composition of the pyroxene phenocrysts. The amphibole is an iron-rich barkevikite with an iron to magnesium ratio of 15 to 1. Lithic fragments 0.1 to 2 em in diameter, consisting of fine-grained aggregates of alkali feldspar with very small amounts of clinopyroxene, and occasional inclusions of medium-grained porphyritic to non\u00ad porphyritic igneous rocks of various compositions, make up an additional 5 to 20 percent of the rock.

The glass is dark greenish brown, refractive index 1.509, and contains numerous subequant anhedral microlites less than 10 microns in diameter. Such glass, because it has escaped the extensive ground\u00ad water leaching that most hydrated natural glasses have undergone, accurately represents the liquid phase of the pantellerite magma. The sodium, iron, zirconium, and halogen content of the glass are extremely high for a silicic rock, and the aluminum, magnesium, and cal\u00ad cium content are abnormally low. The molecular ratio of alkalis to alumina is 1.8, whereas typical calc-alkalic rhyolites have a ratio of less than 1 and comendites a ratio only slightly greater than 1. The analysis is very similar to those of hyalopantellerites (table 1, columns TABLE l.-Chemical analyses of pantellerites and pantellerite glass 78 . 01 .19 . 00 . 08 .78 1. 30 . 62 2 8.59 70.1 2.2 5.5 .11 . 47 6.8 4. 7 ND .12 . 01 69.0 69.5 67.1 10.5 11.5 10.4 3.0 4.0 4.2 2. 1 1.2 1.5 . 1 .3 . 36 .4 .5 .39 7. 1 5.2 4.8 4.6 4.8 4.7 . 15 . 13 ND . 1 .6 2.6 ---------- .3 . 28 .6 .6 ND . 05 . 72 --__ --__ 99.63 1.

B88 PETROLOGY AND PETROGRAPHY 2 and 3) and pantellerite glasses (table 1, column 4) from the type area, the island of Pantelleria in the Mediterranean (Washington, 1913, 1914).1 With the marked exception of sodium and the halo\u00ad gens, the whole-rock composition of the Gold Flat Mem\u00ad ber (table 1, column 5) calculated from (1) the glass analysis and (2) the inferred composition of the pheno\u00ad crysts and lithic material in the tuff agrees well with the whole-rock analyses of densely welded, devitrified tuff from the Gold Flat Member (table 1, column 6). More than a quarter of the sodium originaJly present in the Gold Flat Member has been lost from the devitri\u00ad fied rocks of the unit. As a result of the very high original alkali to alumina ratio of the rock, even with an the ferrous iron assigned to normative arfvedsonite and the remainder of the ferric iron assigned to acmite, more than 2 percent N !40 is available beyond that re\u00ad quired to form feldspar. The exact phase or phases that this excess soda entered into on cooling of the Gold Flat Member are not definitely known. However, it seems most probable that they were very soluble and thus readily removed by ground water. In addition, some sodium was probably leached by ground water :from \"stuffed\" cristobalite formed by devitrification of the originally glassy groundmass at relatively high temperature (Noble, 1965). An even greater amount of sodium has been leached by ground water from den~ely welded vitrophyric tuffs (table 1, column 7). Halogens, particularly chlorine, were lost :from the tuffs part metal halides devitri\u00ad fication and were subsequently removed by ground wa\u00ad ter. Fluorine and chlorine contents o:f an analyzed 1 'The term \"pnntell erite\" should be applied only to rocks which have approximately the same chemical composition as the type pantellerites (and in particula1\u00b7 the hyalopantellerites) from sim\u00ad more silicic rocks such as the obsidian described by Lacroix (1930, analysis D). Comenrlites have the same chemical characteristics as pantellerites, but are less mafic and less peralkallne. Sorla rhyolite is a more general term, which, in addition to comendlte, includes metaluminous and subaluminou s soda-rich rhyolites and sodlc rhyolites with high alumina and low normative quartz content which are transitional to trachyte . Because the abnormally high iron and titanium content of pantellerites is highly atypical of rocks which are generally tcrmed rhyolite, the specific term \"pantellerit e\" should be used when it is warranted, instead of the more general term \"soda rhyolite. \" Grounrlmass chemistry is critical in the interpretation of peralkaline rocks. The phenocrysts lnrluded in a whole-rock analysis of a por\u00ad phyritic rock will tend to obscure the true degree of differentiation that the magma has undergone. Thus a pantelleritlc liquid may be so di\u00ad luted by sanidine and quartz phenocrysts us to make the whole-rock analysis that of a comendite. .Moreover, because of the vagaries of crystal accumulation and separation, whole-rock analyses will not, in general, represent a previous ly existing magmatic liquid. vitrophyre (table 1, column 7) are similar to those o:f analysis 5 in table 1, and several hydrated glass separates have a halogen content almost as great as the nonhy\u00ad drated glass. These data show that the chlorine and fluorine analyses of the nonhydrated glass are repre\u00ad sentative o:f the original halogen content of the ground\u00ad mass o:f the member as a whole. The results o:f quantitative spectrographic analysis o:f the glass from the Gold Flat Member are given in table 2, column 1. In addition, semiquantitative spec\u00ad trographic analysis (Myers and others, 1961) o:f this glass gives the :following values (in weight percent) : Th 0.02, U <0.05, Ce 0.15, Nd 0.07, Sm 0.015, and the remainder the rare earths below the limits o:f detec\u00ad tion as given by Myers and others (1961, table 2).

NOBLE B89 concentration of Be, Nb, Ph, Sn, Th, the rare earths, and the rare alkalis are abnormally high, being as much as 10 times greater than in a typical comendite glass from the Spearhead \u00b7Member of the Thirsty Canyon Tuff (table 2, column 4), which in turn is several times richer in most of these elements than the crustal average for granitic rocks (Taylor, 1964). Analytical data on other alkalic and peralkalic glasses and rocks from southern N ye County show that the concentration of most of the minor elements discussed above varies systematically with the concentration of zirconium. This suggests that the Pantellerian pantel\u00ad lerites, which contain less than half the zirconium of the Gold Flat Member, also contain appreciably less Be, Nb, and rare earths than the Gold'Flat. GENESIS The normative quartz-albite-orthoclase proportions of analyzed pantellerites are very similiar to minima of the \"pantellerite\" systems studied experimentally by Carmichael and Macl(enzie ( 1963), strongly suggesting that crystal-liquid equilibria are involved in the genera\u00ad tion of natural pantelleritic liquids. The normative quartz-feldspar proportions of the glass from the Gold Flat Member are compatible with this interpretation. The available analyses of comenditic and pantelleritic glasses show a strong positive correlation between both alkali/alumina and Na20/l{ 20 ratios and total iron. This relation, readily explainable by crystal fractiona\u00ad tion, is difficult if not impossible to understand if the high sodium and total alkali contents of pantellerite liquids are explained by volatile transfer of alkalis. The high iron, titanium, zirconium, and halogen con\u00ad tent of pantellerites and their very low magnesium con\u00ad tent suggest that they represent very late stage residual liquids. Moreover, the abnormally high concentration of rare earths, niobium, and other minor elements in the glass from the Gold Flat Member, analogous to that in the late-crystallizing fractions of alkaline intrusive bodies, as well as the high gallium to aluminum and rubidium to potassium ratios, can best be explained by extreme fractional crystallization. The concentration of these minor elements in the liquid portion of the pan\u00ad tellerite mag1na, shown by the whole-rock spectro\u00ad graphic analyses (table 2, columns 2, 3), is consistent with such an origin. Carmichael and MacKenzie (1963) believe that pan\u00ad tellerite liquids form by the separation of sodium-rich Ab60 to trachytic tion. To develop a high N a20 to K20 ratio as well as a high alkali to alumina ratio in a residual liquid by the separation of feldspar, the feldspar must be more potassic than the liquid from which it crystallizes. Al\u00ad though trachyte lavas and tuffs were erupted from the Black Mountain volcano both before and after the em\u00ad placement of the Gold Flat Member, the ratio of N a20 to K20 in these rocks never exceeds unity. A melt with the extremely high N a20 to K20 ratio of the glass from the Gold Flat Member obviously cannot form by re\u00ad moval of sanidine with a N a20 to K20 ratio greater than 1.1 from a liquid containing subequal amounts of these oxides. Mafic and low-silica intermediate alkalic rocks in gen\u00ad eral have much higher N a20 to K20 ratios than do alkalic trachytes. The Gold Flat Member, and possibly most pantellerites, are thus tentatively believed to have been generated by the direct fractionation of liquids of alkali basalt, mugearite, or \"mugearite-trachyte\" com\u00ad position without the existence of magma of trachytic composition as an intermediate phase. OTHER PANTELLERITE OCCURRENCES Although a few comendites have previously been recognized in the western hemisphere, only two rocks that might accurately be termed pantellerites have been described. The groundmass composition computed from the whole-rock chemical analyses and the modal data given by Walker (1961) from a study in Oregon are, however, somewhat richer in aluminum and poorer in sodium than the Pantelleria glasses. The rock from Texas described by Lord (1900) is likewise high in alumina content. The obsidian artifact from Chichen Itza, Mexico, analyzed by Washington (1923) contains much less iron and titanium than do the Pantelleria glasses, and should be termed a comendite. The Gold Flat Member is also one of the few pantel\u00ad lerite ash-flow tuffs known. Others occur on the island of Pantelleria and on the Eolian islands, both in the Mediterranean (Borsi and others, 1963), and published descriptions strongly suggest that similar rocks are present in at least several areas in east Africa.

GEOLOGICAL SURVEY RES\u00b7EARCH 1965 PRECIPITATION AND RECYCLING OF PHOSPHATE IN THE FLORIDA LAND-PEBBLE PHOSPHATE DEPOSITS By Z. S. ALTSCHULER, Washington, D.C. Abstract.-Precipitated apatite and layered claylike apatite occur in the weathered and crudely reworked residuum of the Hawthorn Formation and are sources of some pellets and pebbles reworked into the overlying Bone Valley Formation. The occurrence of both types of apatite demonstrates that the phosphate pellets are not principally of fecal origin. The resi\u00ad dual zone underlying the Bone Valley is characterized by rapid alternations of quiet-water sedimentation and turbulent re\u00ad working. The immaturity of first-cycle elastics derived from this littoral environment suggests that the well-rounded pellets that occur in the Hawthorn and Bone Valley Formations are the products of more extensive reworking. Many marine phosphate deposits are composed of nodular or pelletal apatite which, by virtue of internal structure or texture or the petrography of its setting, can be ascribed to primary or early diagenetic origins. However, the phosphate pellets of the Hawthorn and Bone Valley Formations, in the land-pebble district of central Florida, are petrologically ambiguous. They are distinguished by derivative textures, and show little evidence of primary deposition. They lack (1) the spherulitic structure of the concretionary phosphates in the Cretaceous shales of Montana (Pecora and others, 1962) and Wyoming (McConnell, 1935), (2) the ag\u00ad glomerate or accretionary textures shown by the oolitic phosphate like that in the Phosphoria Formation (McKelvey and others, 1953) and the Karatau deposits in Kazakhstan (Bushinsky, 1964); and (3) the filled protozoan tests of the North African phosphorites (Cayeux, 1939). PETROGRAPHY OF THE PELLETS The pellets in the Bone Valley Formation are largely detrital. The Bone Valley is a Pliocene transgressive deposit of graded-bedded marine and estuarine clayey and pebbly sands. Its phosphate was concentrated and reworked from the underlying Hawthorn Formation as phosphatized and residually enriched weathering debris. The weathering and marine reworking of the Hawthorn pellets are manifest in their Bone Valley occurrence in better rounding, in lighter colors (indicative of leaching and oxidation) , and in a lower content of carbonate impurity and higher contents of phosphate and fluorine (Cathcart and McGreavy, 1950). In the Hawthorn Formation, which is an extensive body of sparsely phosphatic Miocene limestones, dolo\u00ad mites, and marls, the pellets occur. as lustrous ellipsoids and ovules of sand to granule size. These are crystal\u00ad line aggregates of carbonate-fluorapatite (Altschuler and others, 1952) so fine grained as to be optically iso\u00ad tropic, or only faintly birefringent, and microgranular in texture. They are generally dark and structureless. Fine-grained inclusions of quartz and calcite and rhombs are common, and phosphate pseu\u00ad domorphs of rhombs are also present. Many pellets con\u00ad tain fine debris of protozoan tests and finely divided or\u00ad ganic matter and iron oxides. The organic matter may be rudely clustered and alined, and the internal clusters may rarely display flow texture, as in fecal pellets. How\u00ad ever, these pellets in the land-pebble field are totally lacking in the surface markings and shaping that would make fecal-extrusion origin a certainty. Other pellets are clearly detrital fragments of bone or replaced fos\u00ad siliferous limestone. Still others are featureless, diffi\u00ad cult to classify, and possibly syngenetic. The presence of a small percentage of rounded re\u00ad fractured grains offers proof that some Hawthorn pellets have been transported. Transport is even more widely inferred from additional evidence: Quartz in\u00ad clusions in pellets are commonly finer than the quartz deposited with the pellets, the pellets are generally highly rounded and polished, and many pellets have bleached outer rims. Thus the ovoidal pellets of the land-pebble district pose a problem, for whether they originate principally as fecal pellets as suggested by Bushinsky ( 1964) for all phosphate pellets, as replacements of nonphosphatic pellets, or as detrital fragments of syngenetic or re- U.S. GEOL.

This prob\u00ad lem was recognized in other deposits by Cayeux ( 1939), who postulated that the pellets require two spatially separate environments-an area of precipitation in which pellets were formed by agitation, and an area of accumulation to which pellets were transported by bot\u00ad tom currents. Many beds in the Phosphoria Formation contain irregular phosphate pellets mnbedded in a ce\u00ad ment or matrix of texturally similar phosphate, and many of the Phosphoria oolites contain cores of pelletal phosphate (Lowell, 1952; Cressman and Swanson, 1964). Similar direct progressions from precipitated to accretionary and reworked phases are seen in the l{aratau phosphorites (Bushinsky, 1964; fig. 3). But layered precursors of clastic phosphate in the land\u00ad pebble phosphates are obscure. In 1949, Altschuler and Boudreau reported observa\u00ad t~ons of ~rimary intimately asso\u00ad Ciated w1th their clastic derivates in the Bone Valley Formation, but the report was classified until 1956. After 1956 the authors have been engaged in other phases of the work. The current expansion of interest in the phosphates, and in their exploitation, recreates a forum and a stimulus to present anew our unpublished data and explanations on primary phosphate, along with more reeent facts and suggestions. PRE-BONE VAL'LEY WEATHERING AND CONCEN,TRA TION Preceding the deposition Bone Valley Forma\u00ad tion the Hawthorn was subaerially weathered and its s~rface was marked by irregularitie~s, karst features, and nver channels (Cathcart, 1963). Its uppermost zone eharacteristically became enriched in the less soluble eonstituents, and it has therefore been referred to as a zone .of residual enrichment. It is marked not merely by static leaehing, however, but also by penecontem\u00ad poraneous slump and brecciation, erude lensing eolluvial of carbonates, and by phosphatization (Altsehuler and others, 1964a, b). The eon current op\u00ad eration of these processes is clearly implied in the sub\u00ad aerial weathering and development of karst features on phosphatic There is also evidenee of eontemporaneous marine in\u00ad cursion and reworking in the fonn of extensive bur\u00ad rowing, and in the many elastie fragments of littoral fossils, with molds and casts showing detailed preserva\u00ad tion of small struetures and surfaee ornamentation. This indicates nearby derivation and short transport. P\u00b7RIMARY PRECIPITATION AND RECYCLING OF APATITE In addition to the mechanical concentration of apatite during weathering, chemieal concentration, or precipi\u00ad tation, of apatite occurred during the marine incursions in the zone of residual concentration. It is manifest in thin ( 1-5 mm), discontinuous seams of brown hard aphanitic apatite. These deposits encrust surfaces of clay and dolomite, and coat and impregnate the inner linings of animal burrows. In many places the precipi\u00ad tated apatite infiltrates and incorporates sand and silt from the underlying substrate, or simply includes detri\u00ad tus rolled in during growth. Some of the crusts con\u00ad tain scattered protozoan-test fragments like those in the pellets of the Hawthorn and Bone Valley Formations. Fragments representing all stages of phosphate encrus\u00ad tation and incorporation occur as disoriented slump breecia in filled borings and as angular elastic pebbles reworked into adjoining or overlying lentils. Further\u00ad more, small, angular or subrounded brown flakes and granules derived from this precipitated apatite occur among the other apatite pellets in overlying sands of the lowermost Bone Valley Formation. They may be distinguished from the more \"normal\" older Hawthorn detritus by their flatter shapes and greater angularity. They nevertheless indicate a pattern of derivation which becomes obscured through more extensive transport and reworking, but which may be of considerable import\u00ad ance in the generation of rounded pellets. Striking additional examples of the reworking of precipitated phosphate are seen in the coarse black and brown pebbles and cobbles of phosphatized limestone and dolomite which have been transgressively reworked into the graded-bedded lower unit of the Bone Valley Formation. These pebbles are commonly flat or plate\u00ad like fragments with outer zones of black or brown or\u00ad ganic-rich apatite, and cores of only partly replaced carbonates. Figure 1 illustrates a pebble showing two successions of recycling. Phosphate precipitation be\u00ad gan in a quiet organic-rieh environment colonized by boring organisms, and deposited a layer of black apatite that vms devoid of coarse detritus. Precipitation was followed by high -energy erosion that tore off a slab of coherent precipitate and adjoining substrate. The frag\u00ad ment, probably somewhat eroded, was then redeposited in obverse position in a second \u00b7quiescent lagoon or pan, where again apatite was precipitated from water of high biologic activity, coating the other side of the fragment and filling the old borings with a new generation of apatite of different color. The second surface was also bored prior to incorporation of the pebble in the Bone Valley gravels.

R\u00b7ight, Obverse of cobble, showing second coating of apatite (b) and later borings. Another important variety of parent material, found in the Homeland, Fla., area, consists of cements and clayey members of graded sets in the lower Bone Valley. It is a mixture of very fine grained apatite and clay, and 'ms described by Altschuler and Boudreau (1949) as follows: The layering consists of a cycle of units ranging from 3 rom. to 1 em. in thickness. The complete ~ycle may be broken down into the following four phases in order of superposition: ( 4) Medium- to fine-grained sand of quartz and detrital phosphate with a phosphatic cement ( 3) Coarse-grained sand of quartz and detrital phosphate with a phosphatic cement or matrix (2) Pebbles of clay like phosphate (1) Bedded claylike phosphate Not all of the units are present in every cycle. In much of this layering the units are not sharply defined, but grade into one another. 'l'his is particularly true where the layers of cLaylike phosphate are absent, and the succession becomes merely one of alternating fine-and coarse-grained material. Some of the claylike phosphate layers show shrinkage cracks [or borings] which are filled with material of different appear\u00ad ance. The material filling the shrinkage cracks is detrital at some horizons (see pl. 9 [fig. 2 of this paper]) but in many samples it is a form of differently colored precipitated phos\u00ad phate. Thus, the tilled cracks do not necessarily represent a period of subaerial exposure. The cracking may be due to post\u00ad depositional shrinkage and the filling may be the result of wave or current action or of circulating ground-water solutions .

However, whatever interpretation is finally adopted must account for several salient features: the gradation from coarse-to fine-grained material, the probable derivation of the pebble layers by erosion of the claylike layers, and the possi\u00ad bility of occasional subaerial exposure clue to very slight changes in sea level. This combination of features can be explained in a general manner by assuming an area of shallow-water phos\u00ad phate deposition subjected to wave and current action of fluctu\u00ad ating competence. Recurrent and possibly seasonal changes associated with climatic variation could easily cause an alterna\u00ad tion of periods in which currents were of greater and lesser competence. A possible interpretation is illustrated diagram\u00ad matically below: Possible interpretation Lithology Submergence or greater . wave activity.

Possible emergence Quiescence ____________ Clay like bedded phosphate. Cla~like phosphate is also found as irregular layers of white, chalky, aphanitic and lightweight apatite in\u00ad terspersed with true clay in the residual zone. It is commonly impure even if devoid of quartz or clastic apatite, being admixed with cla.y and occasionally with carbonates. Many white pebbles of obviously first-cycle natu~e, both in the residual zone as angular fragments and m the Bone Valley as rounded fragments, must derive from such material. This white claylike apatite may be widespread parent material in the land-pebble field, but it is not unequivocally a precipitated material. Its dominantly white color, despite occurrence in green or gray matrix, suggests that it is materi:tl that was bleached or weathered prior to deposition. Similar materials occur in the \"hardrock\" phosphate deposits of northern Florida as a fine phosphatized limestone powder interstitia ,] to the Unequi\u00ad vocally supergene deposits of white apatite also occur in the Bone Valley Formation (Altschuler and Boudreau, 1949) and in the coastal plain of New Jersey (J. P. Owens, 1963, oral communication) under zones of leaching. The hydraulic operations by which the hard\u00ad rock phosphates were mined in the past used to create artificial lacustrine deposits of \"white soft-rock\" phos-phates. It appears that natural deposits of weathered fine material, composed of phosphatized clay-size lime\u00ad stone and of clay, were common at some stages of the subaerial exposure and reworking of the Hawthorn Formation, and that similar materials were also washed into nearshore lagoons and basins during normal stages of clay accumulation. Such materials, even though o\u00a3 replacement origin, are nevertheless primary deposi\u00ad tional precursors of first-cycle white phosphate pebbles. The quantitative importance of the precipitated apa\u00ad tite crusts and of the claylike phosphate is difficult to assess without amassing quantitative petrographic data. The apatite pebbles of the Bone Valley Formation are largely made up of replaced Hawthorn limestone, al\u00ad though many of these pebbles are also veneered with precipitated apatite. The pellets in the Bone Valley may have been largely reworked as Hawthorn pellets, because many pellets also conta.in the veneers of later apatite. However, precipitated apatite is clearly the source of some first-cycle pellets in the Bone Valley Formation and may be an important source of original Hawthorn pellets. Bedded claylike white phosphate is relatively rare in the land-pebble district. Its im\u00ad portance as a source material should be evaluated from the occurrence of first-cycle pellets and pebbles depos\u00ad ited as white or light-colored detritus, in the midst of darker matrix. GENETIC IMPLICATIONS The occurrence of both precipitated and claylike de\u00ad posits of apatite in the residual, or transitional, zone of the Hawthorn Formation establishes parent mate\u00ad rials for a variety of pellet and pebble types in the Bone Valley Formation. However, the precipitated apatite does not necesarily reflect \"normal\" marine pre\u00ad cipitation but rather a form of chemical recycling in which shallow marine apatite is derived from highly phosphatic waters enriched by weathering of low-grade phosphorites on the adjoining landmass. It is o\u00a3 in\u00ad terest to note that this process, as well as the accumu\u00ad lation of detrital flour as layers of clay like apatite, took place in a littoral environment in shallow quiescent basins. Both types of deposit were also characteristic \u00ad ally reworked in turbulent transport by shortlived events, possibly single storms or tidal events. In the residual zone these characteristics of cyclicity, and of rapid alternation of chemical and clastic facies, found expression in rudimentary bedding, in poor sort\u00ad ing, poor rounding, and in chaotically oriented soft fragments of apatite, attapulgite, montmorillonite, and dolomite, above their bleached and burrowed parent ALTSCHULER B95 layers. In these circumstances the moderately well rounded nature of most of the Hawthorn pellets sug\u00ad gests a history of extensive reworking, and possibly dis\u00ad tant transport, rather than a derivation as syngenetic or fecal material from the' immediate environment.

GEOLOGICAL SURVEY \u00b7RESEARCH 1965 DISTRIBUTION OF TANTALUM IN SOME IGNEOUS ROCKS AND COEXIS.TING MINERALS OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BATHOLITH By DAVID GOTTFRIED and JOSEPH I. DINNIN, Washington, D.C. Abstract.-Neutron-activation and chemical analyses of tanta\u00ad lum have been made on 8 comagmatic igneous rocks, 7 pairs of coexisting biotite and hornblende, and 11 samples of the acces\u00ad sory minerals sphene, ilmenite, and magnetite. The results help fill a marked gap in the published geochemical literature. Tan\u00ad talum content is lowest in the gabbroic rocks, 0.13 to 0.24 ppm, increases to a maximum in the tonalities, 0.45 ppm, and re\u00ad mains relatively constant in the and quartz mon\u00ad zonites, 0.38 to 0.45 ppm. Biotite and hornblende, which account for about 80 percent of the tantalum in a tonalite and quartz monzonite, are progressively enriched in tantalum in the more siliceous rocks, but concomitantly decrease in abundance. The distribution coefficient, Ta in biotite/Ta in hornblende, ranges from about 2 in tonalites to 1 in granodiorite and 0.5 in the quartz mo~onites. Sphene has the greatest tantalum content, 36 to 100 ppm, of any mineral in the batholith ; ilmenite con\u00ad tains 6 to 10 ppm, 0.3 to 1.8 ppm. From the lim\u00ad ited data available the average tantalum content of the batholith is estimated to be 0.4 ppm. Since the comprehensive study of Rankama (1944), our knowledge of the geochemistry of tantalum in igneous rocks has increased very little. The chief dif\u00ad ficulty has been the lack of suitable analytical methods for the analysis of tantalum in the very low parts-per\u00ad million range. Consequently, systematic studies on the distribution of tantalum in igneous rocks and minerals of batholithic complexes of the ealc-alkalic magma type are still virtually nonexistent. Recently, however, neutron-activation analysis has been applied to the de\u00ad termination of the tantalum eontent of a limited num\u00ad ber of igneous rocks by Morris and Olya ( 1960), Atkins and Smales (1960), Butler and Thompson (1962), and Butler and Smith (1962). The precision of this method is such that quantitative analyses can now be made to within \u00b1 10 percent on rocks and minerals containing only a few tenths of a part per million of tantalum. Analyses for tantalum by this technique have been uti-lized in this report and were particularly valuable for evaluating the results obtained by a chemical method developed specifically for the determination of tanta\u00ad lum in the parts-per-million range in roeks and min\u00ad erals. The neutron-activation analyses reported here were made by J. Thorn pson of the Imperial College of Science and Technology, University of London, to whom we are extremely grateful. The chemieal method used for the determination of tantalum (Dinnin, report in preparation) is based upon the seleetive extraction from fluoride solution of a tantalum-triphenylmethane complex. Tantalum is separated with niobium from the bulk of the rock\u00ad forming elements by extraction with methylisobutylke\u00ad tone from a mixture of dilute hydrofluoric and hydro\u00ad chloric acids. The earth acids are stripped with dilute hydrogen peroxide solution, and the tantalum fluoride,_ crystal violet complex is selectively extracted from di\u00ad lute hydrofluoric acid with benzene. The absorbance of the extracted solution is compared at 600 millimi\u00ad crons with standards similarly extracted. A few tenths of a part per million of tantalum can be determined on a 1-gram sample with an uncertainty of 0.1 part per million. TANTALUM IN ROCKS The igneous rocks of the Southern California batho\u00ad lith provide us with an excellent opportunity to follow the behavior of tantalum through the various stages of differentiation of a calc-alkalic magma. Detailed field and laboratory studies of the igneous rocks by Larsen (1948) and Miller (1937) and of minerals by Larsen and Draisin ( 1950) make it possible to relate analyses for tantalum to the geologic occurrence, miner\u00ad alogy, and chemical composition of some of the rocks and minerals of the batholith. The additional rocks and minerals used in this study are from the same rock U.S. GEOL. SURVEY PROF. PAPER 525-B, PAGES B96-Bl00 B96 GOTTFRIED AND B97 units described by them. Neutron-activation analyses for tantalum on eight selected rocks ranging in com\u00ad position from olivine norite to a highly siliceous quartz monzonite are listed in table 1.

These data clearly show that tantalum is indeed an extremely rare element, inasmuch as none of these rocks contains more than half a part per million tantalum. Tantalum content is low\u00ad est in the gabbroic rocks and appears to increase sys\u00ad tematically from 0.13 ppm in the lime-rich silica-poor olivine in the more siliceous horn\u00ad blende norite. This progressive increase continues up to the tonalites, which contain about 0.45 ppm tantalum. The 0.45 ppm tantalum. Thus, tantalum shows approximately a twofold increase in absolute enrichment in the early stages of differentia- ~ 0.5 :J ..J i 0.4 a:: IJJ a..

Obviously, more extensive data are required to define the trend more precisely. TANTALUM IN COEXISTING BIOTITE AN.D HORNBLENDE Data on the manner in which tantalum is distributed among the various minerals of these rocks are of great importance for understanding the pattern of the varia\u00ad tion of tantalum in the suite as a whole. Studies by Rankama (1944, 1948) and Fleischer and others (1952) on tantalum and niobium have clearly shown that there is a strong geochemical affinity between these elements and titanium. The ionic radii of these elements are 0.69 A for Nb+5, for Ta+5 and 0.68 A for Ti+4 ( Arhens, 1952). An excellent discussion of the crystal chemistry and mineralogy of these elements has been published by Kuzmenko ( 1961). On the basis of this information, selected suites of the titanium-bearing minerals biotite, hornblende, sphene, ilmenite, and mag\u00ad netite-from a wide range of rock types from the Southern California batholith-were analyzed for tantalum. Analyses for tantalum in the hornblendes and bio\u00ad tites are listed in table 2, which also compares the anal\u00ad yses by neutron activation with those determined by the chemical procedure. Except for the wide discrep\u00ad ancy on one sample (EL 38-167, hornblende) the agree\u00ad ment between the completely independent methods is excellent. Plots of the tantalum content of these min\u00ad erals against the chemical composition of their host rocks (fig. 2) yield smooth, well-fitting variation curves. These curves show that biotite and hornblende are pro\u00ad gressively enriched in tantalum in the more siliceous rocks. However, it is significant that in the tonalites, biotite contains about twice as much tantalum as the coexisting hornblende; whereas, in the granodiorite, the tantalum content is the same in each mineral, and in the quartz monzonites, biotite contains about half as much tantalum as the hornblende. Figure 3 shows the partitioning of tantalum between seven pairs of coexisting biotite and hornblende. The points fall on a smooth curve on this distribution dia\u00ad gram, and it appears likely that these coexisting min\u00ad erals crystallized under equilibrium conditions. Mueller (1963) has examined the chemical data on five pairs of coexisting biotite and hornblende published by Larsen and Draisin ( 1950) and points out the possibility that a rather high degree of equilibrium was attained by these minerals with respect to iron and magnesium.

The coefficient ranges quite widely but sys\u00ad tematically, from 2.3 in the most mafic tonalite to about 0.5 in the quartz monzonites. As pointed out by Neu\u00ad mann and others (1954) and Kretz (1961), distribution coefficients of coexisting mineral pairs can be expected to vary with composition and temperature of crystalliza\u00ad tion of the minerals. In the Southern California batho\u00ad lith, the composition of the magma, and hence of these minerals, has changed substantially during the course of differentiation, and crystallization may have taken place over a considerable temperature range. Thus the variations in the distribution coefficient obtained are quite expectable. TANTALUM IN OTHER ACCESSORY MINERALS Analyses for tantalum in titanium-bearing accessory minerals are listed in table 3. Listed in order of de\u00ad creasing average tantalum content, the minerals are TABLE 3.-Results of chemical determinations of tantalum in sphene, magnetite, and ilmenite from igneous rocks of the Southern California batholith. Sample sphene, ilmenite, magnetite. tains from 36 to 100 ppm tantalum and tends to be higher in the granodiorites. Magnetite contains from 0.3 to 1.8 ppm tantalum, the maximum Ta concentra\u00ad tion occurring in the magnetite from a highly siliceous granodiorite. Two samples of ilmenite contain 6 and 10 ppm tantalum, indicating a\u00b7 twelvefold tantalum enrichment over that of magnetite from the same rocks. TANTALUM BUDGET IN THE ROCK The quantitative distribution of tantalum in a tona\u00ad lite and a quartz monzonite is shown in table 4. The data indicate that the minerals considered in this paper account for nearly all the tantalum in the containing rocks. In each rock, biotite and hornblende account for more than 80 percent of the tantalum in the bulk rock. Most of the remaining tantalum is tied up in sphene, magnetite, and ilmenite. In the tonalite, biotite is by far the most important host mineral for tantalum; whereas in the quartz monzonite, hornblende contributes as much tantalum to the whole rock as does biotite. The data show that although the tantalum content of hornblende and biotite is greater in the quartz monzonite, these minerals are less abundant in such rocks than in the tonalites. In their study of the distribution of tantalum in granites containing biotite, ilmenite, and rutile, Znamenskii and others ( 1957) found that 50 to 73 per\u00ad cent of the tantalum in the rocks is present in biotite. However, in allanite- and sphene-bearing granitic rocks which contain about 0.3 percent sphene, at least 60 per\u00ad cent of the tantalum in the rocks is concentrated in sphene ( Znamenskii and others, 1962; Znamenskii ::i ...J ~ a:: UJ c..

From this point on, the amaunt of tantalum in the rocks depends chiefly upon the amount of biotite and hornblende present and upon the tantalum content of these minerals. Biotite and horn\u00ad blende are present in progressively smaller amounts in the granodiorites and quartz monzonites, whereas con\u00ad comitantly the tantalum content progressively increases in these minerals in the more siliceous rocks. Because of this inverse relation the amount of tantalum in the rocks ranging from tonalite to quartz 1nonzonite re\u00ad mains relatively constant. Chemical analyses of biotites and hornblendes from rocks of the Southern California batholith ranging in composition from gabbro to quartz monzonite (Larsen and Draisin, 1950) show that these minerals vary widely in composition. These variations indicate that the rocks have crystallized over a wide range of physico\u00ad chemical conditions. The increase of tantalum in the minerals, which are similar to the minerals chemically analyzed, corresponds closely to Fe+2 content and the Fe+2 /Mg ratio, whereas no systematic relations exist between tantalum and titanium. Inasmuch as a coupled substitution is required for the substitution of tantalum for titanhun, the amount of tantalum in these minerals may be controlled to a large extent by variations of the other chemical constituent\u00b7s in the minerals. The role of the minor constituents may be equally as important. Lithium, for example, is highly concentrated in mica and according to Kuzmenko (1963) plays an important role in the crystal chemistry of tantalum. Thus it appears that the variation of tantalum in these minerals is governed by the interaction of crystal-chemical and petrologic factors. Considerably more data are required to make a reason\u00ad able estimate of the average tantalum content of the batholith. The available data, however, indicate that the tantalum content is on the order of 0.4 ppm. Ac\u00ad cording to Rankama (1944) the average tantalum con\u00ad of igneous rocks is 2.1 ppm. The average niobium content of the batholith is believed to be approximately 5 ppm (Gottfried and others, 1961). Thus, for the batholith as a whole the Nb/Ta ratio is 12.5. This ratio agrees reasonably well with the Nb/Ta ratio of 11.4 given by Rankama for igneous rocks. REFERENCES Ahrens, L. H., 1952, The use of ionization potentials. I.

Abstract.-Electronmicroprobe analyses of meteoritic metal\u00ad lic copper indicate an iron content of 1.1 to 4.5 percent. Phase equilibrium considerations suggest that these values are too high. On the basis of electronmicroprobe analyses of copper\u00ad iron boundaries and of iron coated with small thicknesses of copper, we conclude that analyzed values of iron in meteoritic copper are unreasonably high because of fluorescence effects. Copper in most of the stony meteorites occurs as small (1-20 micron) grains associated with troilite and nickel\u00ad iron (Ramdohr, 1963). In the Norton County, Kans., enstatite achondrite, copper grains almost as much as 1 mm in diameter occur. Electronmicroprobe analyses of this copper indicated an iron content of about 4.2 weight percent (Keil and Fredriksson, 1963). How\u00ad ever, phase relations in the system Cu-Fe-S are incon\u00ad sistent with reported microprobe determinations of meteoritic copper. R. A. Yund (written communi\u00ad cation, 1964) has shown that the assemblage troilite is stable only below 475\u00b0+25\u00b00, being above that temperature by the assemblage bor\u00ad nite-Fe-troilite. It is doubtful that bornite was ever present with iron and troilite in meteorites at elevated temperatures, because the small amount of copper pres\u00ad ent could be contained in solid solution in troilite. The solubility of copper in troilite is about 2 weight percent at 600\u00b00 (Gehlen and I{ullerud, 1962). At 475\u00b0C or less, copper with a low iron content would exsolve from the troilite, forming the observed Cu-Fe-troilite as\u00ad semblage. Copper formed at 475\u00b0C in equilibrium with iron contains less than 0.2 weight percent iron in solid solution (Tammann and Oelsen, 1930), much less than the microprobe analyses show. This discrepancy sug\u00ad gested the present study. The iron content of copper in the Miller, Bath, and Penokee chondrites (see accompanying table) was de\u00ad termined by using the microprobe constructed in a U.S. Geological Survey laboratory. Natural, copper\u00ad free troilite was used as a standard, and the data were corrected for background, counter deadtime, and fluo-GEOLOGICAL SURVEY \u00b7RESEARCH 1965 METALLIC COPPER IN STONY METEORITES By MICHAEL B.

The apparent iron content ranged from 1.1 to 4.5 percent and varied within single copper grains, suggesting that analytical uncertainties were involved. The analyzed copper grains ranged from 10 to 20p. in diameter, which is larger than the spot size of the elec\u00ad tron beam (2p.). The principal uncertainty appeared to lie in the possibility that CuKa radiation from the analyzed copper grain excited FeKa radiation in the sur\u00ad rounding iron-rich minerals.

The speci\u00ad mens were analyzed using hoth an Applied Research Laboratory microprobe and the USGS probe at excita\u00ad tion potentials shown in figure 1. For the thinnest layer the FeKa radiation is produced by direct penetration of the electron beam and by secondary (fluorescence) excitation due to the X-ray continuum and the char\u00ad acteristic CuKa radiation. For greater thicknesses the electron beam is entirely absorbed by the copper layer, and the Fei{a radiation arises only from fluorescent ex\u00ad citation, primarily by CuKa. The intensity of FeKa apparently decreases exponentially with the thickness of the copper layer, but is equivalent to 3 percent or more of iron for iron covered by 3.5p. of copper. The data show the importance of both the excitation potential and the X-raytakeoff angle on the fluorescence effect. The ARL probe may be used at lower excitation potentials than the USGS probe. The lower the po\u00ad tential, the smaller the beam penetration and hence the smaller the fluorescence effect. For a given excitation potential, the USGS probe, which has an X-ray takeoff U.S. GEOL.

It is necessary, therefore, to analyze large grains or to separate the copper from the matrix in order to determine the true iron content. Although the reported size of copper grains in the Norton County achondrite is apparently large enough to greatly reduce the fluorescence effect, the thicknesses of the grains analyzed by l{eil and Fredriksson are unknown. We were unable to examine the copper analyzed by them because the largest copper grain in their sample was destroyed by mild repolish\u00ad ing (Prof. P. Ramdohr, oral communication, 1964). Our search of Norton County achondrite fragments rich in metal and sulfides disclosed no copper grains large enough for electronmicroprobe analysis (the cop\u00ad per is present as thin plates, in some cases enclosing sul\u00ad fide grains), and we have been unable to repeat their analyses.

WALTHALL, Denver, Colo., Beltsville, Md., Washington, D.C. Abstract.-K-Ar and Rb-Sr dating of biotite occurring in the Carmel Formation gave ages ranging from 165 to 140 m.y. and 163 to 85 m.y., respectively. No simple relation between chemi\u00ad cal or physical factors and the variation in ages was discerned. However, the data strongly suggest that the variation in iso\u00ad topic age is a result of alteration caused by the base-exchange action of ground water on the biotite. In southwestern Utah, the Carmel Formation at the type locality, Mount Carmel (fig. 1), contains lime\u00ad stone with marine mollusks which date the lower part of the formation as Middle Jurassic (Bajocian). In this area the limestone overlies bentonite which consists chiefly of illite, kaolinite, and mixed-layer chlorite\u00ad illite-montmorillonite in variable proportions with amounts of biotite, sanidine, quartz, apatite, hornblende, and zircon (Schultz and Wright, 1962).

Ages are in millions of years : K-Ar age in roman (as, 165) , Rb-Sr in italic (as, 85). biotite from bentonite layers in the Carmel Formation would give a definitive isotopic age for the Bajocian strata in Utah. However, variable K-Ar and Rb-Sr ages preclude a unique age assignment, and the varia\u00ad tions in the measured ages, rather than a definitive iso\u00ad topic age for the Bajocian, are the main topic of this paper. Bentonite layers, averaging only an inch in thickness, occur at many places in the Carmel Formation. In southwestern Utah, the bentonite is at or near the base of the Carmel Formation, usually resting directly on the Navajo Sandstone of Triassic(?) and Jurassic age (Wright and Dickey, 1962). A Bajocian age for the limy lower unit of the Carmel Formation in south\u00ad western Utah is shown by an association of molluscan species that includes the pelecypods Thraeia 'Weeda Stanton, Trigonia Meek, and (Meek and Hayden) (Imlay, 1964, p. C3-C4). In central Utah this unit of the Carmel contains, in ad\u00ad dition, montanaensis Meek, and an ammonite genus similar to Zemistephanus. In the Twin Creek Ljmestone of Wyoming and northern Utah this assemblage as a whole, as well as some of the individual species, is restricted to Member C, which is considered late Bajocian because it contains ammo\u00ad nites resembling Zendstephanus and Ohondroceras, and because it immediately overlies Member B, which con\u00ad tains an ammonite assemblage indicative of early late Bajocian age (R. W. Imlay, written communication, September 1964). In the soutlnYestermnost corner of Utah (between Gunlock and Cedar City), a red siltstone within the U.S. GEOL. SURVEY PROF. PAPER 525-B, PAGES B104-B107 Bl04 MARVIN, WRIGHT, AND WALTHALL B105 lower part of the Cannel Formation underlies the biotite-bearing bentonite. No fossils have been found in the red siltstone, but because of its similarity in lith\u00ad ology and stratigraphic position to Member A (Gypsum Spring Member) of the Twin Creek Limestone, it is considered of Bajocian age. The bentonite layers of east-central Utah which oc\u00ad eur near the top of the Carmel FoTination are younger and possibly were foTined during the Bathonian. These lie above the limestones containing marine mollusks used to date the Carmel Fonnation, and hence a somewhat younger age might be expected. Schultz and Wright (1962) investigated the benton\u00ad ites of southwestern lTtah and found that they range in composition from dominantly montmorillonite to kaolinite and illite. The nonclay crystals of sanidine, biotite, apatite, hornblende, zircon, and, rarely, quartz. Only the sporadic presence of a few microcline crystals indicates that any part of the bentonite beds is non volcanic in origin. The bentonite layers occurring in east-central Utah were not included in the mineralogic investigation by Schultz and Wright (1962), but they are mineralogi\u00ad cally the same as the layers in southwestern Utah and are closely related to them in geologic time and strati\u00ad graphic occurrence. The location and a brief description of the bentonite samples used in this investigation are given in table 1. Approximate locations are shown on figure 1. Descrip\u00ad tions of the biotite samples are given in table~; analyti\u00ad eal data and computed ages are given in tables 3 and 4. Potassium analyses were made by flame photometry using lithium as an internal standard; argon, rubidium, and strontium were determined by isotope-dilution tech\u00ad The overall analytical error for the l{.:Ar teTininations is approximately -+-5 percent of the calcu\u00ad lated age. The estimated errors given for the Rb-Sr age determinations (table 4) include a probable error assigned on the basis of the enrichment in radiogenic strontium. The biotite concentrated from the six bentonite sam\u00ad ples ranges from dark green to dark yellow brown. Apatite is present as microscopic inclusions. A sub\u00ad ordinate part of the biotite in all concentrates has been oxidized to opaque black iron-rich oxybiotite which is common in volcanic rocks. The biotite in sample 1 has been partly altered to veTiniculite; this is evident both under the petrographic microscope and in X-ray powder diffraction photographs. Samples 3 and 6 are contaminated with kaolin flakes carried into the mag\u00ad netic concentrate by attached minute grains of hydrous iron oxide.

Six Rb-Sr age determinations Bl06 GEOCHRONOLOGY (table 4) also are variable, ranging frmn 85 to 163 n1il\u00ad lion years. The maximum ages approach the value of 166 million years, which Kulp (1961) gives as the time boundary between the Bajocian and Bathonian. The range in ages is attributed to chemical altera\u00ad tion of the biotite; however, the data fail to reveal a simple relation. For example,, sample 1 with a low potassiun1 content of 3.96 percent gives a 1{-Ar age of 165 million years (table 3), the highest value found. The rubidium content of the sample is 484 parts per mil\u00ad lion (table 5), the highest in the group, and the ratio KjRb of 82 is the lowest of the group. The abnormally low ratio of K/Rb might be explained as the result of TABLE 3.-K-Ar age determinations of biotite from the Carmel Formation [K determinations by P. Elmore and F. G.

Sample 1 contains 110 ppm of normal strontium (table 4) compared to 12-38 ppm in the other 5 samples. The large amounts of rubidium and strontium in sample 1 suggest the possible introduc\u00ad tion of these elements from ground water. The com\u00ad puted age of 85 million years has no real significance. Three Rb-Sr determinations give similar ages of 163 m.y. (table 5), which fall between the two K-Ar ages of 162 and 165 m.y. The rmnaining ages, excluding sample 1, range from 140 to 154 1n.y., averaging 148 m.y. Again, two Rb-Sr ages are similar, 147 and 148 m.y., whereas the K-Ar ages give the extremes. The grouping of the ages suggested the possibility of a second event at approximately 150 m.y. ago, but the variability of the K-Ar ages and the unreasonably low Rb-Sr age of 85 m.y., computed for sample 1, argue more strongly for alteration of the biotite by ground water. This conclusion is supported by the partial vermiculite structure of the biotite in sample 1 and the alteration of enclosing tuff to various clay minerals. Also, there is no evidence for deep burial of the Jurassic sedi\u00ad mentary rocks or of a thermal event in the sample lo\u00ad calities that would account for the lower ages. There is an apparent correlation between the K Ar age and size range of the analyzed samples. The finer grained mica gives lower ages. Although the lower ages for the finer grained biotite might suggest loss of argon through diffusion, an equally reasonable explana\u00ad tion n1ight be the greater ease of attack by ground water. Samples 3 and 6 have a large percentage of clay con\u00ad taminant; the effect of the contaminant on Rb-Sr ages could not be ascertained. Sample 3 gives a Rb-Sr age compatible with samples 2 and 5; sample 6 gives a lower age but agrees with the age of sample 4. We conclude that the best minimum age for these bentonite layers is 163 m.y. Ground-water alteration of the biotite is the principal cause of the variability of the K-Ar and Rb-Sr ages. The chemical processes of al-MARVIN, WRIGHT, AND WALTHALL B107 teration may have been very c01nplex. The l{-Ar and Rb-Sr isotopic systems have not been altered to the same degree, but even more difficult to comprehend is that neither system gives consistent results. Kulp and Engels ( 1963), in discussing the causes for discordance in K-Ar and Rb-Sr ages of 1nicas, point out that base exchange in micas may result through the action of ground water. They conclude that very large amounts of potassium may be removed from biotite by base ex\u00ad change without affecting the K-Ar age; however, addi\u00ad tion of rubidium from ground waters would be expected to be accom.panied by removal of Sr87, so that \"the Rb-Sr age will be lowered relative to the unchanged l{-Ar age\" (Kulp and Engels, 1963, p. 234). In the samples from the Carmel Formation, sa1nple 1 follows the l{ulp-Engels suggestion, with the Rb-Sr age being less than the l{-Ar age; sample 2 gives virtually concordant results; samples 3, 5, and 6 are reversed with the l{-Ar age less than the Rb-Sr, suggesting perhaps a thermal effect. However, this seems unlikely, consid\u00ad ering the proximity of samples 2 and 3 and samples 5 and 6. Thus, a definitive conclusion cannot be drawn 758-810 0-65 -8 from the available data, except that ground-water al\u00ad teration which may have acted over a long period of time in a variable manner appears to be the 1nost satisfactory explanation. Our study further em.phasizes that cau\u00ad tion is required in dating biotite from altered tuffs. Biotite-sanidine pairs afford a useful combination but, unfortunately, sufficient sanidine for analysis was not available in the samples from the Carmel Formation. REFERENCES Imlay, R.

GEOLOGICAL SURVEY RESEARCH 1965 POTASSIUM-ARGON AGES OF SOME PLUTONIC ROCKS, TENAKEE AREA, CHICHAGOF ISLAND ' SOUTHEASTERN ALASKA By MARVIN A. LANPHERE, ROBERT A. LONEY, and DAVID A. BREW, Menlo Park, Calif. Abstract.-Potassium-argon age measurements are compatible with the interpretation that a Chichagof Island granitic com\u00ad plex composed predominantly of syenite is early Paleozoic in age. Discordance between apparent ages of hornblende and biotite probably reflects the metamorphic effects of a nearby tonalitic batholith of Mesozoic age. An age of 406 m.y. ob\u00ad tained on hornblende from syenite is considered a minimum for the Paleozoic intrusive complex. These results are similar to potassium-argon and lead-alpha ages reported for intrusive rocks about 230 miles farther south in the Bokan Mountain area of Prince of 'Vales Island. In a recent investigation, Lanphere and others ( 1964) reported potassium-argon and lead-alpha age me~t~ that an early Paleozoic, probably Or\u00ad dovician, age for granitic rocks of the Bokan Mountain area of Prince of Wales Island, southeastern Alaska (fig. 1) .. In the present study, potassium-argon ages that we Interpret to represent an early Paleozoic age were obtained for comagmatic granitic rocks in the T~nakee area of Chichagof Island, approximately 230 miles northwest of the Bokan Mountain area. A reconnaissance geologic map of Chichagof Island has been publi~hed by Loney, Berg, and others (1963), and more detailed reports are in preparation. Loney, Condon, and Dutro ( 1963) studied the stratigraphy of the middle Paleozoic rocks in an area located a few miles north of Tenakee Inlet (fig. 1). The eastern third of the Tenakee area is underlain by and interbedded con\u00ad glomerate. The age assignments of some of these units are based on more recent work. The western two-thirds of the area is underlain largely by intrusive rocks of Paleozoic and probable or inferred Mesozoic age. A large tonalitic batholith which occupies the south\u00ad western part of the Tenakee area is Mesozoic, probably Cretaceous, on the basis of a lead-alpha age of 110-+-20 million years (T. W. Stern, written communication, 1963) for zircon from tonalite on the south shore of Tenakee Inlet and west of the area covered by figure 1. Smaller areas of granitic rocks in the vicinity of Tena\u00ad kee Inlet (fig. 1) are inferred to be of Mesozoic age. Ages measured on the Gypsum Creek Quartz Monzonite located about 10 miles north of Tenakee Inlet provide additional evidence of Mesozoic plutonism on eastern Chichagof Island. A potassium-argon age of 103-+-5 m.y. for biotite (R. F. Marvin, written communication, 1964) and a lead-alpha age of 150-+-20 m.y. for coexist\u00ad i~g zircon (T. W. Stern, written communication, 1963) differ by more than analytical uncertainty, but these ages indicate a probable Cretaceous age of the Gypsum Creek Quartz Monzonite. The igneous complex extending from Point Hayes northward past the town of Tenakee lies just west of the Devonian limestone-conglomerate sequence. Horn\u00ad blende syenite and biotite biotite\u00ad and sodalite-bearing sye\u00ad nite are less abundant rock types (Loney, Berg, and o~hers, 1963). The presence of abundant clasts of sye\u00ad nite and of related rock types in the limestone-conglom\u00ad erate sequence suggests that they were derived from the adjacent plutonic complex and that the plutonic roeks are pre-Devonian. Unfortunately the field rela-. ' tions between the units are not clear beeause of poor exposures. The Paleozoic age assignment for this com\u00ad plex of intrusive rocks is based on data presented in this paper. A belt of hornfels, schist, and marble lies between the syenite-rieh complex and the tonalitie batholith to the west. Smaller areas of these metamorphic rocks occur northeast of the syenite-rich complex and as iso- U.S. GEOL. SURVEY PROF. PAPER c.

The 406+16 m.y; age for hornblende from sample 62ALe15 suggests an early Paleozoic age for the syenitic complex. The stratigraphic significance and regional implications of this result are discussed later in this paper. The analyses of sample 62ALe11 reflect the contact metamorphic effects of the nearby tonalitic batholith. The 119-m.y. potassium argon age for sample 62ALe11- biotite indicates that the biotite was formed or recrystal\u00ad lized during the period of Mesozoic plutonism; this date agrees well with the lead-alpha and potassium-argon ages mentioned previously. We were unable to obtain a pure hornblende concentrate, free of fine-grained, in\u00ad tergrown biotite, from sample 62ALe11. An X-ray dif\u00ad fraction trace of the hornblende concentrate which was used for the isotopic analysis showed that the concen\u00ad trate actually is a hornblende-biotite mixture. The high potassium content (see table) also suggests that the hornblende concentrate contains an appreciable amount of biotite. The 247-m.y. age measured on the horn\u00ad blende-biotite mixture is a minimum age for the horn\u00ad blende component, and this result confirms the Paleozoic age assigned to the syenitic complex on the basis of the age of 62ALe15. It is clear that 62ALe11 hornblende retained a significant \"memory\" of a Paleozoic age, though the extent of this memory cannot be calculated because the X-ray data are not precise enough to make a correction for the biotite impurity. The clasts in the conglomerates of the eastern part of the area must be Devonian or older in age because Devonian fossils are found in limestone which inter\u00ad tongues with the conglomerates (Loney, Berg, and oth\u00ad ers, 1963). But the 275-m.y. date for hornblende from the quartz diorite boulder (sample 62ALe14a) in the conglomerate is at least 70 m.y. younger than the 345- m.y. elate accepted for the end of the Devonian Period LANPHERE, LONEY, AND BREW Blll (Kulp, 1961). The alteration of the bouider suggests the possibility that it may have been affected by emplace\u00ad ment of the granodiorite pluton located approximately 1 lj2 miles south of South Passage Point (fig. 1), but the reason for the apparent loss of radiogenic argon from the hornblende of sample 62ALe14a is not definitely kno\u00b7wn. Clasts of syenite collected at Peninsular Point were not suitable for analysis because the hornblende has been cmnpletely replaced by chlorite. The 406-m.y. age for hornblende (sample 62ALe15) suggests a Silurian age for the syenitic complex of the Tenakee area, based on current estimates of the geologic time scale (Kulp, 1961). However, '\\Ve consider a Silu\u00ad rian assignment a minimum because, as stated previ\u00ad ously, we assume that the potassium-argon ages are min\u00ad imum values. \u00b7lve suggest a probable Ordovician age for the syenitic complex, based on the agreement, within analytical uncertainty, between the potassium-argon ages of sample 62ALe15 hornblende and the 431 +21- m.y. and 446+22-m.y. ages of hornblende from the quartz monzonite and quartz diorite units of the Bokan )fountain area of Prince of 'Vales Island (Lanphere and others, 1964). In the Bokan Mountain area, which is about 230 miles south of the Tenakee area, the meta\u00ad morphic effects attributable to Mesozoic plutonism are minor, and the potassium-argon ages of hornblende from the older intrusive units were interpreted to indi\u00ad cate emplacement during the Ordovician period (Lan\u00ad phere and others, 1964). Although the composition of plutonic rocks is quite different in the widely separated Tenakee and Bokan Mountain areas, the similar potas\u00ad sium-argon ages obtained in the two areas suggest that southeastern Alaska was the locus of important early Paleozoic granitic emplacement.

GEOLOGICAL SURVEY RESEARCH 1965 A LARGE TRANSITIONAL ROCK GLACIER IN THE JOHNSON RIVER AREA, ALASKA RANGE By HELEN L. FOSTER and G. WILLIAM HOLMES, Washington, D.C., Beltsville, Md. Abstract.-The rock glacier in the Johnson River area is notable because of its well-developed mesorelief features, because it is one of the few reported in Alaska which descends below tree limit, and because it is visibly moving forward. The rock glacier, approximately 1 mile long, is an end member of an un\u00ad broken series of ice-related features and merges upvalley with an ice-cored moraine 2 miles long, which merges with an ice glacier in the cirque. \u00b7A long narrow train of bouldery debris fills a tribu\u00ad tary valley in the drainage basin of the Johnson River in east-central Alaska (fig. 1) ; the lower third of the train is a rock glacier. As defined by Capps (1910), \u00b7a rock glacier is an accumulation of rock debris in a tongue-shaped, fan-shaped, or spatulate form, resem\u00ad bling a small glacier. It has characteristic longitudinal ridges and transverse crescentic furrows and ridges on its upper surface, and, when active, terminates in a steep bare slope. The rock glacier is one of several in the Johnson River area, but rock glaciers are not as abundant here as Wahrhaftig and Cox (1959) found them to be in the central Alaska Range. Although rock glaciers are not commonly reported in literature on Alaskan geology, they are known to occur in the Brooks and Wrangell Ranges and in the Chugach, Talkeetna, and Mentasta Mountains. The rock glacier described in this paper merges up\u00ad valley with a long ice-cored ablation moraine whose sur\u00ad face form indicates that the moraine is slowly moving clown the valley. The ablation moraine extends up\u00ad valley for nearly 2 miles to an area where it is transi\u00ad tional with a small active cirque glacier. Most rock glaciers in the Alaska Range heretofore described do not 1nerge with ice-cored ablation moraines or with gla\u00ad ciers, but head in empty cirques or extend outward from valley sides ('\\Vahrhaftig and Cox, 1959, p. 409). Hence, the rock glacier described in this paper is a fea-ture transitional between a moving ice-cored moraine and a rock glacier at present unrelated to glacial ice. FORM Moraine.- The dimensions, form, slope, and meso\u00ad relief features of the moraine and rock glacier are shown on figure 2. The upper end of the moraine is unmarked by a terminal ridge, but lies along a zone where rocky debris becomes so concentrated as to ob\u00ad scure the glacier ice. The most prominent features of the moraine are longitudinal ridges which extend for about 2 1niles from the ice glacier to the rock glacier. The ridge on the south side is covered by the toe of a talus fan near the ice margin; it is joined down valley by two smaller ridges which also originate fron1 talus fans. These ridges are apparently stable, are covered by tundra vegetation, and appea.r to contain more small interstitial debris than the main body of the moraine. A fosse as much as 25 feet deep lies between the mar\u00ad ginal ridges and the valley wall except where talus fans encroach on the edges. The north side of the moraine is bounded by an unstable ridge of _unweathered boul\u00ad ders about 18 feet wide and 25 feet high. A deep fosse separates this ridge from the valley wall. In the fosse, a small stream flows to a point near the lower boundary of the moraine, where the strean1 has been diverted through the valley side to the north. To the south of this ridge is a second, lower ridge, covered with weathered and lichen-covered boulders. Down the cen\u00ad ter of the moraine is a broad boulclery ridge or elon\u00ad gated lobe, approximately 75 feet wide and 25 to 40 feet high. Between these ridges are hummocks and lobes as much as 25 feet high, composed mostly of un\u00ad weathered boulders arranged in an apparently random fashion. A few thaw pits occur in the moraine; the largest (fig. 1) is located at about 4,500 feet above sea level near the lower end of the moraine. This pit is U.S. GEOL. SURVEY PROF. PAPER 525-B.

Boulders and smaller fragments as well as vegetation fre\u00ad quently can be seen sliding down the active face. The lower boundary of the rapidly moving surface layer is dashed. about 50 feet deep and contains banded glacial ice ex\u00ad posed in the walls, underlying bouldery ablation morame. Rock glacier.-The boundary between the ablation moraine and the rock glacier is difficult to place without drill holes or excavations. It probably lies in the area between the lowest thaw pits and the uppermost con\u00ad centration of concentric furrows and ridges (Wahrhaf\u00ad tig, written communication, 1962). This area is about 4,300 feet above sea level. A gravity survey might be used to determine this boundary. The gross slope of the rock glacier is nearly the same as that of the moraine, with a slight increase in gradient near the lower end of the rock glacier. The north side of the rock glacier is oversteepened, with slope angles of as much as 45\u00b0, whereas the south flank is gently in\u00ad clined. Oversteepening of the north flank is probably caused by spreading of the rock glacier at a slight bend in its course. Boulders roll down the north flank and over the adjacent tundra. Widening of the rock gla\u00ad cier in this area is also indicated by the diversion of a lateral stream (A, figs. 1 and 2) into the next valley. The two marginal fosses of the moraine continue along the sides of the rock glacier. The terminus is asym\u00ad metrically bilobate; the northern lobe reaches the lower elevation and is apparently more active. The moving face (fig. 3) of the northern terminal lobe is at a 33\u00b0 angle of repose, and is about 150 feet high. A two-layer structure in the rock glacier can be seen at the moving front (fig. 3). The upper layer, 15 to 25 feet thick, is composed of unstratified, poorly sorted, blocky debris. The lower layer is compose? of som~\u00ad what sorted, finer debris. The textural difference IS the result of a crude sorting process as the upper layer is disturbed and slides over the lower layer. The larger blocks cascade to the foot of the slope, leaving finer debris on the slope at the angle of repose. Diagnostic mesorelief features abound on the rock glacier. These include transverse crescentic furrows and ridges 25 to 800 feet long, bowed downslope, and typically with relief of 5 to 10 feet. Many of the fur\u00ad rows are covered with boulders which are nearly free of lichens; the absence of lichens may be due to per\u00ad sistent snow drifts and to recent movement of the sur\u00ad face. In places, lichen-covered boulders have rolle.d into the furrows, suggesting surface movement. Longi\u00ad tudinal trenches, also characteristic, are common. Most of them are about 5 feet deep (although some are as deep as 25 feet) , V shaped in profile, and floo:ed by lichen-free boulders. Radial trenches, resemblm~ extension fractures of a glacier, intersect both the longi\u00ad tudinal ridges and the crescentic furrows. Steps occur in the terminal area. The treads are typically 100 feet wide, and the risers are roughly 20 feet high. Boulders on the treads of the steps are mostly lichen covered, but those on the risers are fresh, indicating recent movement. COMPOSITION The rock glacier and ice-cored moraine are com\u00ad posed of various mixtures of rock, ice, and water. The rock component consists of material ranging from boul\u00ad ders to silt-and clay-size particles, and resembles till. However, because a significant source of material is talus, a bulk analysis would probably show that the material is coarser than the local till. From exposures at the snout, on the flanks, and in steps and lobes it is apparent that boulders ar~ c?n\u00ad centrated on the surface. This may be due to a slftmg out and downward migration of fine material by move\u00ad ment of the surface layer, to downward migration of fine material, or to contribution of large fragments from talus fans. Surface boulders are typically large\u00ad commonly 3 feet in diameter. Nearly all the boulders are angular or subangular, and none of those seen are faceted or striated. Boulder counts made in the rock glacier show granite to be predominant (47 to 88 percent), with minor amounts of fine-grained mafic rocks (7 to 19 percent), diorite (2 to 28 percent), and felsite (1 to 9 percent). This lithology bears out the conclusion of Wahrhaftig and Cox (1959, p. 415) that rock glaciers in the Alaska Range are derived mostly from roeks which break up into large blocks, such as granite, rather than rocks which weather into small slabs, such as schist. FOSTER AND HOLMES Bll5 The ice content of the ablation-moraine section may be 80 percent or more, even near the lower end of the section. At 4,500 feet elevation a large thaw pit re\u00ad vealed slightly dirty glacial ice overlain by only about 5 feet of rock debris. The ice content of a rock glacier may also be high. W ahrhaftig (written communication, 1962) reports that tunnels in rock glaciers in the San Juan Moun\u00ad tains of Colorado and in the Sierra Nevada of Cali\u00ad fornia show that below a thick layer of debris these rock glaciers are almost pure ice. As the Alaska Range rock glaciers are in the permafrost zone and at high elevations, their ice content must be comparable to those in the mountains in Colorado and California. This ice may have been inherited from the ablation moraine or, less likely, may have formed as massive ice bodies in permafrost. Minimum potential ice content could be inferred from calculations of the porosity of rock gla\u00ad cier debris if such data were available. In the absence of these data, porosity values for till may serve as a guide. Published values for 6 Connecticut till samples range from 11.5 to 21 percent (Meinzer, 1923, p. 11) and for 3 till samples (boulder clay) from England, from 23.4 to 25.5 percent (Manger, 1963, p. E42). We cal\u00ad culated approximate porosity values for about 30 till samP.les from New Hampshire, based on specific gravity of the till samples (Goldthwait, 1948, p. 10-11) and specific gravity of rocks similar to those in the State (Birch and others, 1942, p. 14, 20-25); these values range from 12 to 28 percent. Therefore, on the as\u00ad sumption that permafrost occurs in the rock glacier and that adequate moisture was available, the minimum ice content is probably one-tenth to one-fourth of the volume of the rock glacier. Water is present in liquid form, during the warm season, above the permafrost table and in the glacier ice beneath the moraine. It may fill thaw depressions in the ablation moraine, but very little was observed flowing from the snout of the rock glacier or in lateral channels, and none of that was milky. The small amount of rock flour in the streams may be explained by : (a) a small quantity of ice within or below the debris of the rock glacier, (b) little grinding of rocks within the rock glacier or glacier, (c) filtration of rock flour by the debris downvalley, or (d) a very conserva\u00ad tive regime characterized by low accumulation and low ablation. The first suggestion is not consistent with W ahrhaftig's report of ice in the rock glaciers in the Sierra Nevada and the San Juan Mountains, and the second seems unlikely because we saw much fine-grained material in the moving front and in thaw pits. The clarity of the streams probably results from low abla\u00ad tion, which may be due to the protecting cover of debris, together with some filtering action by the large mass of material. SOURCE OF DEBRIS Debris in rock glaciers originates from talus, from moraines, or from a combination of these sources (Kes\u00ad seli, 1941, p. 203-204). The rock glacier here described is composite in origin, being composed of talus, of morainal material, and of debris from a small tributary rock glacier. The ice-cored ablation moraine appears to be the chief source of the debris. This is suggested by the physical relation with the moraine and by relic patterns and forms on the rock glacier similar to morai\u00ad nal topography (fig. 1). Talus now plays a small role in contributing rock material to the debris train, al\u00ad though renewed talus formation is evident on the south wall of the valley, where there is a series of long, un\u00ad weathered, visibly active talus fans beneath the steep granitic face of the canyon. Negligible debris is now being contributed by the three easternmost fans, but the fans upvalley are encroaching on the old, weathered lateral ridge of the moraine. The amount of debris from the tributary rock glacier is minor. VEGETATION The most common form of vegetation on the rock glacier and moraine is lichen, which covers most bould\u00ad ers, except those in furrows and trenches, those on the risers of steps, and those on the moving margins. Grass, moss, blueberry, and other low plants are abundant on the upper surface of the terminal area, as well as along the margins up to an elevation of about 4,500 feet. Shrubs ( alde.r, birch, and juniper) grow up to an eleva\u00ad tion of about 3,400 feet on the northern lobe and a little higher on the southern. Spruce and aspen occur up to the tree limit, about 3,100 feet above sea level and about 240 feet from the northern snout. The forest trees are scattered, but none appear tilted except at the edge of the moving fro~t. However, the thin, peat-enriched soil and turf are disrupted in the terminal zone, a p\u00ad parently from irregular shear stress parallel to the sur\u00ad face. The largest tree near the lower edge of the northern lobe is approximately 125 years old, as deter\u00ad mined by a tree-ring count. The oldest tree, located on the southern lobe, is about 150 years old. MOVEMENT The dynamic character of the rock glacier is shown in several ways. In June 1960, boulders and smaller fragments were observed sliding and bouncing down the advancing face at intervals of 1 or 2 minutes. One fragment struck a member of the field party, which is a B116 GEOMORPHOLOGY AND PLEISTOCENE GEOLOGY warning to future investigators working in this area. Abundant evidence of the movement of material was seen. Uprooted green aspen and spruce trees were lying on the face of the rock glacier, and large living trees around the foot of the rock glacier were gashed and 1nutilated as a result of blows from cascading blocks. Small earth flows occurred on the talus slope, probably as a result of the thawing of seasonal frost. The north side of the rock glacier, about half a mile from the snout, has spread laterally, as was indicated by the ex\u00ad posure of unweathered and lichen-free debris on the flank and by the encroachment of boulders over the tundra vegetation. Other evidence for movement is provided by ( 1) the crescentic ridges, which Wahrhaftig and Cox (1959, p. 434) suggest are surface expressions of thrusting along closely spaced shear surfaces in the rock glacier, and by (2) the recent formation of steps and trenches. The maximum rate of movement of the upper surface near the snout can be estimated from the distribution and age of the trees growing there. The maximum possible distance of travel of a tree growing on the surface is from the tree limit (at the upper edge of the forest on the northern snout) to the edge of the moving face, a distance of about 240 feet; the oldest tree found near the edge was about 125 years old. Thus, the most rapid downvalley movement possible of the upper sur\u00ad face by this calculation is about 1.9 feet per year. This agrees with the measured upper-surface velocities on the Clear Creek rock glacier in the Healy ( 1 :250,000) quad\u00ad rangle, in the Alaska Range, where the rate ranged from 1.3 to 2.5 feet per year (Wahrhaftig and Cox, 1959, p. 396). It is apparent, however, that movement of the upper surface of the snout is not rapid enough to prevent continual establishment of forest growth up to the local tree limit, even as the surface slides down\u00ad valley. Wahraftig and Cox (1959, p. 396) have developed a formula which states that the ratio of the thickness of the upper layer of debris to the total thickness of the rock glacier at its snout is proportional to the ratio of the velocity of the toe of the rock glacier to the velocity of its upper surface. Using this relation, the toe of this rock glacier is computed to be advancing at a maxi\u00ad mum rate of about 0.019 to 0.031 foot per year. How\u00ad ever, limited observations indicate that the computed figure may be a minimum one for this particular rock glacier. REFERENCES Birch, Francis, Shairer, J. F., and Spicer, H.

GEOLOGICAL SURVEY RESEARCH 1965 DISSECTED GRAVELS OF THE RiO COPIAPO VALLEY AND ADJACENT COASTAL AREA, CHILE By KENNETH SEGERSTROM/ Denver/ Colo. Work done in cooperation with the Instituto de Investigaciones Geologicas de Chile under the attspices of the Agency tor International Development, U.S. Department of State Abstract.-Cenozoic history of the area is largely shown by the sediments and landforms of upland-gravel, stream-terrace, and marine-terrace deposits. Upland gravel was probably de\u00ad posi,ted in late Tertiary time before the present course of the Rio Copiap6 was established. Fluviatile-terrace gravel repre\u00ad sents a major episode of river aggradation during an inter\u00ad ruption of a long Pleistocene cycle of valley deepening. Surfaces of marine-terrace deposits at altitudes of 95 to 140m and 171}..- 235 m above sea level may represent interglacial or interstadial episodes, or both. Local fauUing has vertically displaced a high marine terrace at least 40 m. Much of the Cenozoic history of the valley pf the Rio Copiap6, one of the few through-going rivers of ex\u00ad tremely arid northern Chile, and of the adjacent coastal area, must be interpreted through study of dissected gravel deposits. These deposits are here described and related to the sequence of events that produced and modified the present river valley and coastal terrace. DRAINAGE AND RELIEF The Rio Copiap6 (fig. 1) is the major (and only perennial) stream in the area. The channel of the Rio Copiap6 falls a little more than 1,200 meters in a dis\u00ad tance of 156 kilometers. The mean discharge of the stream near its mouth is about 200 liters per second, but along much of its upper and middle courses the flow is perhaps 3 to 5 times that much. The present discharge of the river bears no relation to its natural regimen be\u00ad cause large quantities of water are withdrawn for irri\u00ad gation. Tributaries of the Rio Copiap6 are all without perennial surface flow in the area of figure 1. The terrain is generally rugged; steep slopes are com\u00ad mon, particularly near the valleys of the river and of some of its tributaries. Some interfluves 1,500 to 2,500 m above sea level, or as much as 460 m higher than the river nearby, are parts of a less-rugged matureland. Fluviatile terraces which are a few meters to 100 m or more above the river extend along the sides of major valleys, and a broad marine terrace is present along the coast. UPLAND GRAVEL Upland gravel occurs as remnants of a broad rolling plain that formerly covered extensive areas on both sides of the Rio Copiap6 valley from about 16 km south\u00ad east of Elisa de Bordo to Pabell6n (fig. 1). The plain is considered to be a southerly extension of the pampa of northern Chile, because it follows the same aline\u00ad ment as that feature and is at the same altitude, 1,000 to 1,300 m above sea level. The plain is interrupted by hills and ridges of resistant rock (Segerstrom, 1963b). West of Elisa de Bordo an east-facing escarpment which attains a height of 460 m above the river (fig. 2, left) exposes a section of horizontally bedded gravel, 60 to 100 m thick, that overlies southeast-dipping con\u00ad glomerate and volcanic rocks of the Cerrillos Forma\u00ad tion (Cretaceous) with great angular discordance (fig. 3). The gravel deposit is a mixture of boulders, cob\u00ad bles, and pebbles of volcanic, plutonic, and sedimentary rocks, in a matrix of sand, silt, and clay. The deposit is ill sorted, thick bedded, and, so far as is known, un\u00ad fossiliferous. The proportion of granite cobbles is dis\u00ad proportionate ly high in relation to the limited occur\u00ad rence of plutonic rock in the vicinity, which suggests that part of the gravel material was transported from distant outcrops in the high Cordillera. Therefore, the deposit and landform presumably were very extensive. The upland gravel is important in the physiographic history of the region; like the deeply weathered bedrock that underlies it, the upland gravel is a relic U.S. L__:_j deposits of Llano de Caldera terrace and adjacent terraces 10 15 KILOMETERS Fault U, upthrown block; D, downthroum block 70000' FIGURE 1.-Index map of part of the Rio Copiap6 watershed, and adjacent areas, showing locations of figure 2 left and right, and distribution of marine-terrace gravel.

At least locally the river was superposed on the gravel cover at the east side of a broad ancestral valley that extended from the south along the present Quebrada Sacramento. STREAM- TERRACE DEPOSITS Stream-terrace deposits, or \"fringing gravels,\" which are fill deposits along the Rio Copiap6 and its tribu\u00ad taries, are much younger than the upland or \"mantling\" gravels (Willis, 1929, p. 95). The most extensive fluvi\u00ad atile terrace along the Rio Copiap6 flanks the east side of the valley for about 16 km, from Nantoco to San Miguel (fig. 2, right). The terrace, which descends rel\u00ad atively steeply from Sierra Ladrillos toward the Rio Copiap6, consists chiefly of material derived from the east rather than from farther up the main valley (to the south) . The deposit has been deeply dissected, and the underlying bedrock is exposed in large areas between the terrace segments. The segments typically stand about 70 m above the adjacent valley floor at the lower brink of the terrace and 150 m at the upper limit. However, at some places where the terrace es\u00ad carpment has been cut back unusually far from the river, the brink is as much as 100 m or more above EXPLANATION D Upland gravel 0 2 KM 27\" 45' A METERS s 1400 ,e ~ ~ \" 1200 rJl .g ~ .<:) 1000 ., & 800 600 Vertical exaggeration X5 FIGURE 2.-Maps and sections showing distribution of upland gravel and stream-terrace deposits in two areas in the Rio Copiapo valley.

Two well-preserved terrace remnants remain on the west side of the river near Nantoco (fig.~' right). The more southerly remnant has an abrupt eastern escarp\u00ad ment 107 to 115m high that drops directly to the river. On the opposite side of the river, the brink of a ter\u00ad race north of the mouth of Quebrada Cerrillos is 93 m above the river. Small remnants of fluviatile-gravel terraces with es\u00ad carpments approximately 20 m high occur along the northern flank of the valley between San Miguel, at the mouth of Quebrada Paipote, where the Rio Copiap6 swings westward, and a point about halfway between Toledo and Piedra Colgada. Similar remnants on the southern flank extend up Quebrada Vinita, Quebrada Cardones, and along Rinconada de Bodega. An iso\u00ad lated terrace of about the same height occurs far down\u00ad stream, to the north of Margarita. Locations are shown on figure 1, but because of space limitations the fluvia\u00ad tile terraces are not shown on this figure. The character of the bedding and sorting in the stream-terrace deposits is highly variable. At some places, bedding is excellent; at most places it is ill de\u00ad fined. Some of the thickest deposits contain boulders as much as 2m in diameter set in a matrix so clay rich as to be virtually impervious. In some lenses of gravel\u00ad to silt-size material, sorting is excellent. All gradations of sorting between the two extremes are exhibited. No plant remains or other fossils have been found in the stream-terrace deposits, despite intensive search. Multiple terraces are present on the lower reaches of Quebrada de las Peiias, a tributary of the Rio Copiap6 west of Totoralillo (fig. 1). About 1 to 2 km upstream from the west edge of the Rio Copiap6 valley, five terraces in the fill deposits of the quebrada rise steplike above the channel (fig. 4). The highest of these ter\u00ad races is about 20 m above the present watercourse, and the lowest one 4 to 5 m. Such a valley-in-valley cross profile, where more than one terrace is present on both sides of the stream channel, is fortuitous and highly localized. The present channel of the quebrada is being widened by the undercutting and caving of its gravel banks during the infrequent storms that produce runoff, and this is probably how most of the intermediate ter\u00ad races have been destroyed. The most persistent terrace is the highest, at the 20-m level. The terrace levels at 70 to 115 m along the main valley represent a major episode of river aggradation-an in\u00ad terruption of a long Pleistocene valley-deepening cycle. The level is evidence of a later degradational epi\u00ad sode. The lower levels along the Quebrada de las Peiias represent minor degradational episodes in a Recent cycle of large-scale aggradation whose existence is shown by a thick fill of clastic deposits over bedrock in the main valley bottom. The bottom fill has been modified by later smaller scale trenching. FIGURE 3.-View westward from E'lisa de Bordo, deposits of upland gravel that unconformably tilted of the Cerrillos Formation.

SEGERSTROM B121 MARINE- TERRACE DEPOSITS From Margarita to the sea (fig. 1) the Rio Copiap6 valley traverses an area that was a marine embayment during Pleistocene time. Several marine terraces are preserved, the main one of which is called the Llano de Caldera terrace. At the latitude of the Rio Copiap6, the Llano de Caldera terrace extends about 16 km eastward, rising from about 95 m above sea level at the brink of a sea\u00ad ward escaq)lnent to 137m at the foot of the escarpment north of Maria Isabel. The terrace extends 60 km southward from near Caldera to Bahia Salado. It is 8 to 16 km wide. Eolian deflation in a central un\u00ad drained zone has produced a basin whose bottom is 83 m above sea level (shown with depression contour on fig. 1) 0 Along the north side of the river valley a higher ter\u00ad race extends about 8 km eastward, rising from about 175 111 at the brink of the scarp north of Maria Isabel to 230 111 at the brink of an east-facing escarpment. A north-northeast-striking fault which crosses the valley (fig. 1) has dropped the eastern block 40 to 50 m with respect to the western block. From the foot of the fault scarp the downfaulted terrace extends as much as 11 km farther up the valley, on the south side of the river, to an altitude of 180 m, where the terrace level becomes practically that of the present floor of the Rio Copiap6 valley. On very narrow elevated beaches at the eastern edge of the former embayment, shells have been found as high as 268m above sea level. Along the present coast, an escarpment about 10 km south of Caldera (fig. 1) marks the boundary between the Llano de Caldera terrace and a lower zone of ter\u00ad race levels 15 m to 60 m above sea level. Elsewhere, this zone is very narrow and because of scale limitations is not shown on figure 1. Marine beds that underlie the Llano de Caldera and higher terrace surfaces to the east are sandy and gravel\u00ad ly; they contain abundant mollus~s and so~e. sha:ks' teeth, most of which are morphologically undisbnguish\u00ad able from the remains that litter modern beaches (Seger\u00ad strom, 1963a). Specimens of the mollusk I sognomon collected near Quebrada Seca at about 100 m above sea level are larger than the average of modern forms; they may represent a warm-water species (Jose Cor\u00ad vaJan oral communication, June 1962). Hence, at least ~he uppermost Llano de Caldera terrace sediments were probably deposited during an interglacial or inter\u00ad stadial period. There is abundant evidence of Quaternary crustal movements along the Chilean coast (Segerstrom, 1964, p. 167-168); in northern Chile the amount o~ general crustal uplift probably exceeds that of eustatic fall of sea level. The faults near Monte Amargo and the Morro de Copiap6 are local evidence that at least part of this uplift is differential.

According to Robinson and Peterson (1962, p. 7) these cracks accom\u00ad pany land subsidence which is a result of the differ\u00ad ential com paction of heterogeneous unconsolidated al\u00ad luvial deposits. Thus, land subsidence and the accom\u00ad panying formation of cracks in the surface can be added to the suggested causes of gullying, which include changes in climate, tectonic uplift, destruction of vege\u00ad tative cover by fire or overgrazing, cutting of ruts along wagon trails, or a combination of these and any other factors that upset the regimens of streams. Compaction by plastic deformation is part of a con\u00ad tinuous complex process in the lithification of detrital sedimentary rocks (Pettijohn, 1949, p. 477). Compac\u00ad tion involves the elimination or reduction of pore spaces, accomplished by the partial squeezing out of interstitial fluid and the closer packing, reorientation, crushing, and deformation of grains. However, sedimentary ma\u00ad terials vary greatly in their compressibility. Coarse\u00ad grained material, such as sand, is deposited with rela\u00ad tively low porosity and undergoes very little change in volume thereafter. Fine-grained materials deposited in quiet water generally have high initial porosity and are susceptible to great changes in volume with loading. In the Basin and Range physiographic province the basins are underlain to a considerable depth by un\u00ad consolidated and semiconsolidated sediments derived from the bordering mountains. These sediments, rang\u00ad ing in particle size from clay to boulders, are distri\u00ad buted as lenses of different thickness and areal extent. Under natural conditions, the sediments having the higher porosities are compressed more under equal loads of overburden. The amount and distribution of land\u00ad surface subsidence are related, therefore, to the thick\u00ad ness and areal extent of the more compressible ma\u00ad terials. In places where the subsidence rates differ appreciably within short horizontal distances, the re\u00ad sulting buildup of tensile stresses in the earth materials commonly leads to the fonnation of ruptures extending U.S. GEOL. SURVEY PROF. PAPER 525-B, PAGES Bl22-Bl25 B122 KAM B123 downward from the land surface. Earth cracks thus produced may trend at any angle to the existing drain\u00ad ageways, and also may appear within playas. Wherever a newly formed crack transects a drainage\u00ad way it produces a lower local base level for the up\u00ad gradient segment of the drainageway. Gullying is likely to occur in this upstream segment if the crack is sufficiently wide and deep, and if it penetrates suf\u00ad ficiently permeable material, so as to transmit down\u00ad ward all the overland runoff from an appreciable area. The rate at which gullies form and the size and depth that they attain probably are governed principally by the relative rates at which water enters the crack and is absorbed by its walls or bottom, and by the length of time required for the crack to become so filled with sediment that gullying upstream from that point is arrested. Figure 2 shows a typical crack along which gullying is in progress. A long earth crack in western Pinal County transects several drainage ways (fig. 3). U pstrearn from their points of transection some of the drainageways have be\u00ad come deeply entrenched, but downgradient from the same points they have remained shallow. The presence of trees and shrubs now growing in the earth crack shows that it has served as an effective drain for several years; the approximate age of the crack probably could be determined from shrub-and tree-ring analyses. The longer an earth crack serves as an effective drain by permitting the infiltration of water which flows into it, the more likely the upstream drainageway segments emptying into it are to become entrenched, and the less likely the former pattern of drainage is to become reestablished. According to Pashley (1961, p. 96), runoff entering a crack ordinarily does not flow laterally along it but moves downward to flow into unsaturated permeable FIGURE 2.-Lett, Earth crack 13 miles northwest of Phoenix in sec. 2, T. 2 N., R. 1 W., Maricopa County, Ariz.

However, where all the water cannot be transmitted downward, lateral flow in the crack is initiated; where the gradient along the crack is favorable, part of the gully may grow along the crack and a change in the pattern of surface drain\u00ad age may be established.

However, prior to pumping, the same effect probably manifested itself in long, extremely dry climatic periods, during which pressure losses in the artesian aquifers and grav\u00ad ity drainage from the water-table aquifers occurred naturally.

GEOLOGICAL SURVEY 'RESEARCH 1965 GLACIAL DEPOSITS OF NEBRASKAN AND KANSAN AGE IN NORTHERN KENTUCKY By M. M. LEIGHTON and L. L. RAY, Urbana, Ill., Washington, D.C. Abstract.-Contirmatory evidence that the glacial drift of pre\u00ad Illinoian age on the uplands of northern Kentucky represents two distinct ages has recently been found. Two tills that are deeply weathered and widely separated in time of deposition have been well exposed in a roadcut some 15 miles southwest of downtown Cincinnati, Ohio, in Boone County, Ky. On the basis of their topographic position and their relation to the re\u00ad gional distribution of younger glacial deposits, their profiles of weathering, and their relation to the geomorphic development of the region, the older till is assigned a Nebraskan age and the overlying till a Kansan age. Glacial drift on the uplands of northern Kentucky has been given several age designations. Although Wright ( 1890) described it as lying beyond the mo\u00ad raines now known to mark the boundary of the ice of Wisconsin age (fig. 1), he concluded that the moraines and the deposits beyond were of the same age. T. C. Chamberlin (in Wright, 1890, p. 15) disagreed with this age designation, stating, \"I entertain the view that the drift sheets of the interior which terminate in attenu\u00ad ated borders-and I hold that there are more than one of these-are more ancient than the drift which termi\u00ad nates in the recognized ridged moraines.\" By the turn of the century Leverett (1899, 1902) and others had concluded that the drift of northern Kentucky was of Illinoian age, an interpretation followed on the \"Gla\u00ad ciall\\Iap of North America\" (Flint and others, 1946). Later studies (Durrell, 1956) showed that the boundary of the drift of Illinoian age was not coincident with the outer margin of the drift on the uplands of northern Kentucky, but was more restricted (fig. 1), and that no drift of Illinoian age occurs on these uplands. Therefore, the drift on the uplands must be of pre\u00ad Illinoian age. On the \"Glacial Map of the United States East of the Rocky Mountains\" (Flint and others, 1959) it is shown as Kansan in age. It has been sus-pected (Durrell, 1961) that the drift of Kansan age on the uplands of northern Kentucky may represent more than a single drift, but confirmatory evidence has been lacking. A new cut along Pleasant Valley Road in Boone County, Ky. (fig. 1), provides the confirmatory evidence. Interpretations made here suggest the frame\u00ad work for revisions of older interpretations, as suggested by Rich (1956). GLACIAL DEPOSITS ALONG PLEASANT VALLEY ROAD The gently rolling upland crossed by Pleasant Valley Road has been dissected by a network of small creek valleys. There is no indication from surface features that the upland has been glaciated. Deeply weathered glacial drift is exposed in numerous shallow roadcuts; however, two distinct tills, marked by advanced profiles of weathering, crop out in an especially deep roadcut 1.8 miles northwest of the junction of Pleasant Valley Road with U.S. Highway 42 (see fig. 1 and U.S. Geolog\u00ad ical Survey 71f2-minute topographic quadrangle, Union, Ky.). This roadcut, about 300 feet long and up to 25 feet deep, is at the long grade where Pleasant Valley Road descends from the uplands to cross a small un\u00ad named creek valley (fig. 2). Here, especially well ex\u00ad posed on the northeast side of the road (figs. 2 and 3), an upper till overlies a lower till. The interpreta\u00ad tion that the lower till is of Nebraskan age and the over\u00ad lying till is of J{ansan age rests on the relation of these two tills to the regional distribution of younger tills, on the topographic position of the Pleasant Valley road\u00ad cut, and on the relation of the advanced profiles of weathering to the geomorphic development of the re\u00ad gion, whid1 they reflect and confirm. The following three sections made at this roadcut indicate the character of the two tills : U.S. GEOL. SURVEY PROF.

LEIGHTON AND RAY B129 As of 1964 in a roadcut 0.9 mile to the southeast, there is expo::;ed 5 feet of deeply weathered till. At a lower altitude, some 200 feet down the road, 4 feet of cal\u00ad careous till containing limestone pebbles overlies non\u00ad calcareous gumbotil of which only 1 foot is exposed. Thus, two distinct old tills are recorded-one, assigned Kansan age, over lying one assigned Nebraskan age. Half a mile farther southeast along Pleasant Valley Road, on the upland at an altitude of 860 feet, 3 feet of gumbotil crops out in a roadcut (fig. 4) beneath 4 feet of FIGURE 4.-Exposure on Pleasant Valley Road, 1.4 mile south\u00ad east of area shown on figures 2 and 3. Pick marks top of Kansan gumbotil (3 feet exposed), which is overlain by 4 feet of second-cycle silttil. At the surface is a 2-foot mantle of Wisconsin loess with a well-drained profile of weathering. Marginal arrows mark top of silttil and base of Wisconsin loess. silttil and 2 feet of surficial loess. This gumbotil is the upper till of the uplands to the northwest, and it is identified as Kansan till because its advanced weather\u00ad ing :far exceeds that o:f drift of Illinoian age. PROFILES OF WEATHERING AND THE RELATED GEOMORPHOLOGY Profiles of weathering in the upland tills reflect the character of the drainage conditions and thus of the landscape. 'Where conditions of drainage were poor, gumbotil developed; where conditions of drainage were good, silttil developed. 'Where gumbotil was developed in the primary cycle of weathering and drainage con\u00ad ditions improved, secondary silttil developed (Leighton and MacClintock, 1930, 1962). Thus, changes in con\u00ad ditions of drainage, which are related to the glacial and geomorphic history of the Cincinnati region, are in turn reflected in the character of the profiles of weathering of the upland drifts. The first glacier to invade the Cincinnati area, the Nebraskan, moved across an extensive upland of low relief into the area that today is northern Kentucky (fig. 1). Conspicuous remnants of the preglacial up\u00ad land, locally at elevations of 800 to 900 feet, are widely recognized in southeastern Indiana, northern Ken\u00ad tucky, and southwestern Ohio, where they have been referred to the Lexington peneplain (Fenneman, 1916, 1938). In the Cincinnati area the upland appears to have been drained by northwardflowing streams which occupied broad, shallow valleys 50 to 100 feet below gently undulating interfluves. Preglacial drainage was disrupted by the ice inva\u00ad of Nebraskan age, which dammed Proglacial outwash and other sediments deposited in these ponded valleys in front of the advancing ice were overridden at some places (see section 3). Ponded streams were forced into new channelways, some of which, augmented b} the voluminous glacial melt waters, became permanently established. Thus, by the close of Nebraskan time the Ohio River appears to have been established upon the upland surface of the Cincinnati area. Its course dif\u00ad fered in part from that of today, however, for it fol\u00ad lowed the well-known ancient channelway northward around Cincinnati to Hamilton, Ohio, and thence south\u00ad westward to join what is now the present Ohio valley west of Cincinnati (fig. 1). Drainage was poorly organized, especially in the gla\u00ad ciated areas, after establishment of the Ohio River across the upland. During Aftonian time, the master stream, the Ohio, entrenched its valley below the drift-covered upland surface. Bedrock benches indicative of this stage of landscape dissection have been noted (Brand, 1934; Durrell, 1961), but without the interpretation here given. Short tributary streams sharply entrenched in bedrock eroded head ward from the deepened major val\u00ad ley into the margin of the poorly drained upland, there\u00ad by improving drainage conditions. Far from the mas\u00ad ter stream, however, glacial drift on the upland re\u00ad mained little eroded and poorly drained; it became deeply weathered in place, as is indicated by the pres\u00ad ence gumbotil. B130 GEOMORPHOLOGY weathering and the Kan\u00ad san ice advanced across the drift-mantled uplands of northern Kentucky, south and southwest of Cincinnati. This advance appears to have been slightly less extensive than that of the earlier Nebraskan . Effacement of the glacial surface features by deep weathering and erosion during Yarmouth and later time was so complete that virtually no surface features referable to either of these glaciations remain. During Yarmouth, the longest of the interglacial times, the Ohio River in the Cincinnati area appears to have cut its bedrock valley to its greatest depth, the so-called \"Deep Stage\" (Rich, 1956). It was one of the major rivers of the continent and a striking exam\u00ad ple of early glacial diversion of pre-Pleistocene drain\u00ad age. Valleys tributary to the major streams were ac\u00ad cordingly deepened again and extended farther headward into the drift-covered upland where weather\u00ad ing of the drift was continuing in place. The presence of gumbotil in the profile of weathering, as in sections 1 and 3, indicates that the area crossed by the Pleasant Valley Road remained poorly drained throughout most of Yarmouth time. The silttil, which resulted from a second cycle of weathering imposed on the primary cycle, records the headward extension of valleys into this area, which in turn created better drainage and led to eluviation of much of the clay from the gum\u00ad botil. The sharply incised valley shown in figure 2 and the topographic position of the silttil in the same figure disclose the striking relationship between silttil and topography. Gumbotil of Nebraskan and that of Kan\u00ad san age could not have been formed after the present valley had been cut. Development of the silttil on drift of Kansan age required the improved drainage conditions. The topographic unconformity here is thus intermediate in age. During the third glacial invasion of the area, the Illinoian, which came late in the Pleistocene, the en\u00ad trenched river channel around Cincinnati was in large part ice blocked so that is was not then a through drainageway (fig. 1). It was at this time that a new channel was developed beyond the ice margin from the present mouth of the Little Miami River to the mouth of the Miami River (Durrell, 1961). The re\u00ad sulting gorgelike river channel in this area separated the drift-covered uplands of Kentucky from those of Ohio. No ice of Illinoian age moved on to the uplands of northern Kentucky. It did, however, occupy a part of the upland north of Cincinnati (Goldthwait and others, 1961), and marginal lobes extended into and down the deeply entrenched valleys (Durrell, 1956, 1961). At several places along the Ohio, both above and below Cincinnati, ice assigned an Illinoian age pushed across the entrenched Ohio valley and deposited small masses of till along the valley wall in Kentucky (fig. 1). Lev\u00ad erett ( 1929) noted that some of this till occurs at, and perhaps well below, present river level. Weathering and erosion of the drift in northern Ken\u00ad tucky continued during both the Illinoian ice invasion and the succeeding Sangamon time, for lack of a man\u00ad tle of loess in this area left the older till exposed at the surface. When drainage conditions on the uplands improved, however, as a result of the deepening and extension of the drainage net, profiles of weathering on the glacial deposits were modified. Conditions were no longer favorable for the formation of gumbotil, and second -cycle silt til developed on the exposed gumbotils. Today, drift deposits generally have second-cycle silttil where good drainage conditions have been long established. Although the last glaciation, the Wisconsin, fell short of reaching northern Kentucky, its extensive outwash valley trains choked the major glacial drainageways in the Cincinnati area. These were source areas for the thin veneer of loess that mantles the glaciated areas in this part of northern Kentucky. The loess ranges from 6 or more feet in thickness nearest the source areas to less than 2 feet near the outer boundary of the up\u00ad land drift. It is thoroughly leached and silty and ex\u00ad hibits a profile of weathering indicative of good drain\u00ad age. Where the loess overlies silttil it may merge with it so imperceptibly that, where the loess is thin, the two may be difficult to separate in the field except on the basis of the weathered chert, quartz, and quartzite peb\u00ad bles scattered through the silttil. Where the loess is thicker, its demarcation from the silttil can be more readily determined. Weathering of the underlying drifts has been impeded since deposition of the blanket of loess.

GEOLOGICAL SURVEY 'RES\u00b7EARCH 1965 AGE AND ORIGIN OF THE PUGET SOUND TROUGH IN WESTERN WASHINGTON By DWIGHT R. CRANDELL, DONAL R. MULLINEAUX, and HOWARD H. WALDRON, deposits indi\u00ad cate nonglacial aggradation in the Puget Sound lowland from more than 35,000 years ago to 15,000 years ago. Subsequent ponding of lowland drainage by the Puget glacier lobe during the Vashon Stade of the Fraser and deposition of outwash the Puget lobe resulted in further ag\u00ad gradation. Aggradation was followed by advance of the lobe and ice scour of the Puget Sound trough to a maximum depth of about 930 feet below present sea level. The deep troughs and intervening plateaus of the Puget Sound lowland are the dominant physiographic features of the area, and their formation, which was chiefly in Pleistocene sediments, has been discussed re\u00ad peatedly. Most recent authors have favored a hy\u00ad pothesis under which the troughs were fluvially eroded into a preexisting plain, then modified by glacial scour during the last glaciation. However, recent detailed study of the Pleistocene geology of Seattle and recon\u00ad naissance study of the central part of the low land sug\u00ad gest that the Puget Sound trough was actually formed by ice scour rather than simply modified by it. This paper, which presents the evidence and interpretations that lead to this conclusion, concerns the trough oc\u00ad cupied by the main body of Puget Sound. However, some of the discussion probably bears on the age and origin of other deep troughs in the central part of the lowland. The Puget Sound trough, which extends from Ad\u00ad miralty Inlet southward to Tacoma (fig. 1), is about 40 miles long and generally 3 to 5 miles wide. Throughout most of its length, its depth is 600 to 700 feet; a maxi\u00ad mum depth of about 930 feet below sea level is reached at a point just north of Seattle (U.S. Coast and Geo\u00ad detic Survey Chart 6401). Puget Sound is connected to the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the Pacific Ocean by Admiralty Inlet, which is only 100 to 200 feet deep at its northern end. The Puget Sound trough is the largest of many comparable troughs in the Puget Sound low-land; most of these, such as Hood Canal and Saratoga Passage (fig. 1), are now occupied by sea water. The last glaciation of the lowland occurred during the Vashon Stade (see accompanying table), when an ice sheet originating in the coastal mountains of south\u00ad western British Columbia flowed southward into the Puget Sound lowland to form the Puget lobe. At its maximum extent this lobe terminated about 50 miles south of Seattle, and it probably attained a thickness of at least 4,000 feet over the Puget Sound trough at Seattle.

According to Bretz ( 1913, p. 188-194, 199, 226-227) the sediments are chiefly alluvium :formed by glacial streams that aggraded the lowland to a broad U.S. GEOL.

By a second interpretation (Willis, 1898, p. 119), the sediments are ice-marginal outwash deposited between adjacent ice tongues during repeated occupations of the lowland by the Puget lobe; the ice itself preserved preexisting troughs while outwash built up the adjacent uplands. A third interpretation, sug\u00ad gested by our current studies, is that the sediments represent virtually continuous nonglacial and glacial aggradation just before and during an early part of the Vashon Stade. A nonglacial deposit at the base of the sequence in the Seattle area, on the east side of the Puget Sound trough, consists of interbedded sand, silt, and clay which are of fluvial and lacustrine origin (Mullineaux and others, 1964). A correlative deposit occurs in the up\u00ad land on the west side of the Puget Sound trough west and south of Seattle; south of the latitude of Seattle the deposit commonly includes beds of fluvial gravel. Radiocarbon dates from peat and wood in the non-B134 GEOMORPHOLOGY AND PLEISTOCENE GEOLOGY glacial deposits range from about 15,000 to 24,000 years before the present in the Seattle area (Mullineaux and others, 1964) and from about 28,000 to 35,000 years B.P. in the low land south of Seattle ( Dorn and others, 1962). The deposits probably were formed on the broad, locally ponded flood plains of rivers that drained northward toward Admiralty Inlet during the Olympia Interglaciation (Mullineaux and others, 1964). The flood plains were bounded by uplands that consisted chiefly of sediments formed during older glaciations and interglaciations. To what extent the uplands of the present coincide with those old uplands is not known. The flood-plain deposits now extend to a height of about 65 feet above present sea level on the east side of the trough at Seattle, and to a comparable altitude on the west side of the Puget Sound trough directly opposite ( Sceva, 1957, pl. 1) . Deposition of the nonglacial fluvial sediments was brought to an end by the southward advance of the Puget glac!er lobe, which blocked the northward drain\u00ad age from the lowland and formed a proglacial lake. Silts and clays were deposited in this lake, conformably over the nonglacial sediments, to a height of 150 feet or more above present sea level. These silts and clays constitute the Lawton Clay Member of the Vashon Drift (Mullineaux and others, 1964). The Lawton Clay Member grades conformably upward into the Esperance Sand Member of the Vashon Drift, which is regarded as proglacial outwash and is the youngest widespread deposit formed before the glacier overrode the low land. The interpretation of these deposits is fundamental to an explanation of the history of the trough. The age, distribution, and conformable nature of the non\u00ad glacial deposits and Lawton Clay Member provide a lower limit for the age of the trough, while the origin and distribution of the Esperance Member may bear on its location and configuration. Newcomb (1952, p. 20) recognized two n1ajor units within the Esperance and stated that \"The earlier phase of the sand member appears to be a coarser continua\u00ad tion of the horizontal Admiralty clay, whereas the later outwash phase is undoubtedly the advance outwash of the Vashon glacier.\" In this paper the Esperance Sand Member is restricted to the \"later outwash phase\" of Newcomb, :following the usage proposed by Mullineaux and others ( 1964). The Esperance Sand Member is chiefly fine to medium sand that contains some thin beds of silt. Len\u00ad ticular beds of coarse sand and granule- to pebble\u00ad gravel are common, and in some areas increase upward in abundance, thickness, and coarseness. The sedi\u00ad ments display a variety of types of stratification. Most commonly the lm,ver part of the sand is massive or horizontally bedded, suggesting that the early part of the deposition occurred in quiet, ponded water. Cur\u00ad rent bedding and cut-and-fill stratification become more abundant toward the top, indicating later fluvial depo\u00ad sition. The direction of foresetting in the sand in the central part of the low land indicates southward or southeastward transport of sediment. The Esperance Sand Member is widely distributed in the uplands, both east and west of the Puget Sound trough, from Admiralty Inlet to Tacoma. The sand is widely distributed in the Seattle area between alti\u00ad tudes of about 150 and 400 feet. Many of the sea cliffs west of Everett expose as much as 150 feet of the sand. In Kitsap County, Sceva (1957, pl. 1) mapped the cor\u00ad relative of the sand along the east side of Hood Canal. The Esperance Sand Member is an extensive and thick sedimentary deposit formed before the lowland was overridden by the Puget lobe. The sediment is believed to have come from the Puget lobe ( 1) because of the south and southeast dips of the foreset bedding of the deposit, and ( 2) because the only likely alterna\u00ad tive sources, alpine glaciers in the Cascade Range dur\u00ad ing the Fraser Glaciation, were apparently of insignif\u00ad icant size during the advance of the Puget lobe (Vance, 1957). We postulate, therefore, that the Esperance was deposited by outwash streams, and that it probably was derived largely from the reworking of older un\u00ad consolidated glacial and nonglacial deposits in the low\u00ad land by the Puget lobe during its advance, even though part of the sand may represent alluvium introduced by streams draining the Cascade Range. Following deposition of the Esperance Sand Mem\u00ad ber the Puget lobe overrode the Seattle area, terminat\u00ad ing near the southern margin of the Puget Sound low\u00ad land about 50 miles from Seattle. Subsequent retreat of the glacier uncovered the Seattle area by about 13,500 B.P. (Rigg and Gould, 1957). Thus, using the young\u00ad est date ( 15,000 B.P.) for the nonglacial deposits as an older limit for the Vashon Drift, we conclude that the episode of deposition of the Lawton and Esperance ~\u00a3embers and occupation of the Seattle area by the Puget lobe was limited, before and after, by dates of about 15,000 and 13,500 years, respectively. The short time between these limiting dates suggests that the Esperance was overridden by the glacier immediately after its deposition. ORIGIN OF TROUGH Three hypotheses for the origin of the Puget Sound trough and other simi]ar troughs in the lowland have previously been suggested : ( 1) glacial scour into a pre\u00ad existing fill (LeConte, 1874); (2) preservation of pre-CRANDELL, MULLINEAUX, AND WALDRON B135 glacial valleys during building up of intervening ridges (Willis, 1898); and (3) stream erosion into a preexisting fill (LeConte, 1874; Bretz, 1913). LeConte thought that glacial erosion was the more probable of the two hypotheses he suggested; he proposed that in either case the t:roughs had been cut when the region was higher above sea level than it is now. Willis as\u00ad sumed the existence of preglacial valleys and proposed that ice tongues in the valleys preserved them while glaciofluvial deposits built up the adjacent uplands to form broad plateaus. Bretz pointed out, however, that the plateaus are not cored with bedrock, and that some deposits can be correlated from one plateau to another. He favored fluvial erosion of the troughs in a preexist\u00ad ing fill, after regional uplift of about 1,000 feet during a pre-Vashon nonglacial episode. The evidence now recognized along the Puget Sound trough and described above suggests that glacial scour is the only hypothesis consistent with facts now at hand. The stratigraphic sequence and age of the deposits at Seattle provide the most compelling evidence. These indicate that the site of the Puget Sound trough ad\u00ad jacent to Seattle had been aggraded to a surface several tens of feet above present sea level by the end of the Olympia Interglaciation, only about 15,000 years ago. Subsequently, with no evidence of an intervening ero\u00ad sional period, the fill was further raised to a level more than 150 feet above present sea level by the deposition of lacustrine silt and clay as the Puget lobe blocked the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Uninterrupted aggradation continued with the deposition of sand over the silt and clay until the glacier overrode the Seattle area. This evidence seems to prove that no deep trough existed when the glacier reached the area, yet the trough in virtually its present shape had been formed by the time the glacier retreated, less than 1,500 years later. Thus, the glacier must have eroded the trough. Although this interpretation depends chiefly on the stratigraphic se\u00ad quence and age of the deposits, it is strongly supported by the alinement and shape of the Puget Sound trough and other troughs. First, the long axes of these troughs closely parallel the dominantly southward direction of movement of the Puget lobe during the Vashon Stade. Second, the floor of the Puget Sound trough lies hun\u00ad dre.ds of feet below the deepest part of Admiralty Inlet, whiCh strongly suggests deepening by glacial scour. Finally, smaller basins with several hundred feet \u00b7of closure indent the floor of the main trough, and their direction of elongation parallels the trend of the trough (see U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey Charts 6445 and 6446). Implicit in the proposal that glacial scour produced the trough is a rejection of the commonly held idea that the Puget Sound region was elevated and subsequently depressed by as much as 1,000 feet in late Pleistocene time (Bretz, 1913; Newcomb, 1952; Sceva, 1957; Cran\u00ad dell and others, 1958) . This hypothesis of regional up\u00ad lift and subsidence rests wholly on the depth of the troughs and on the inference that they were subaerially eroded by streams or glaciers. We have found no inde\u00ad pendent evidence of late Pleistocene change in .level of this amount in the Puget Sound low land. We do not know why or how the glacier eroded so deeply at one place in the broad low land and not at another. Three alternative explanations may be noted: ( 1) If the Esperance Sand Member was spread in front of the Puget lobe as a continuous sheet, burying pre\u00ad existing topography up to a present altitude of about 400 feet, the locations of the Puget Sound trough and other similar troughs might well be random. ( 2) If, however, the gross outline of the trough existed during Olympia time, the trough might have localized deposi\u00ad tion of the Olympia sediments, the Lawton Clay Mem\u00ad ber, and the Esperance Sand Member. The difference in resistance to erosion between these loose, saturated sedi\u00ad ments and the older, highly compacted deposits might then have favored deepest scour where the younger sedi\u00ad ments were thickest. ( 3) Finally, a. preexisting trough might have influenced ice scour if it were not com\u00ad pletely filled with the Esperance Sand Member ( J. H. Mackin, University of Texas, oral communication, 1964). By this last interpretation, a tongue of ice may have entered a shallow preexisting valley or trough in advance of the main body of the Puget lobe, preserving the trough as the later, upper parts of the Esperance were deposited beyond its margins. The preexisting trough then localized ice scour, resulting in erosion of the trough to its ultimate depth. Although such a lobation of the Puget glacier may satisfactorily explain localization of the Puget Sound trough, it seemingly does not adequately account for the position of some deep depressions, such as the Lake Washington trough, that are closed at their northern ends. It may well be that some depressions were local\u00ad ized by preexisting topography, that others were scoured in wholly random positions, and that still oth\u00ad ers were localized by factors not yet understood. The postulated eroding ability of the Puget lobe dur\u00ad ing the Vashon Stade was probably not unique, for the presence of an extensive erosional unconformity below the youngest pre-Vashon till in the central part of the lowland suggests the possibility that the glacier that deposited the till also deeply scoured the lowland.

GEOLOGICAL SURVEY RESEARCH 1965 RATE OF ICE MOVEMENT AND ESTIMATED ICE THICKNESS IN PART OF THE TETON GLACIER, GRAND TETON NATIONAL PARK, WYOMING By JOHN C. REED, JR., Denver, Colo. Abstract.-Markers placed on the Teton Glacier near the snowline in August 1963 advanced as much as 37 feet in 13 months while the terminus of the glacier remained in the same position. Movement was nearly uniform in amount and direc\u00ad tion across the glacier to within less than 100 feet of the edges; evidently the glacier moved mostly as a rigid mass, presum\u00ad ably by intense shear in a thin basal and marginal zone and by slippage over the bed. Computations based on changes in sur\u00ad face slope and elevation suggest that the glacier may be as thin as 50 feet at the line of markers. The Teton Glacier lies at altitudes of between 10,200 and 11,400 feet, at the head of a spectacular cirque be\u00ad tween the east ridge of the Grand Teton and Mount Owen (fig. 1). The glacier has been described by Fryxell ( 1935), and its retreat since 1929 has been dis\u00ad cussed by Reed (1964). On August 16, 1963, metal stakes and marks on boulders were placed along a line across the glacier (Reed, 1964, fig. 1 and table 2) just below the snowline. Figure 2 shows the outline of the glacier and the position of the line of markers. On September 21, 1964, these markers were resurveyed, and a new set of stakes was placed along the original line. Table 1 shows the direction and amount of movement of the 1963 markers; table 2 gives the position of the 1964 stakes. A large erratic boulder marked as point G, about 300 feet downglacier from the line of markers, was perched on a 5-foot ice pedestal when its was sur\u00ad veyed in 1963. In 1964 the boulder was found 105 feet S. 47\u00b0 E. of its 1963 position. This amount of move\u00ad ment, which is far greater than that of any of the marks in the line of profile, is thought to be due to toppling and sliding from successive pedestals in the manner de\u00ad scribed by Fryxell ( 1933).

The metal stakes driven into the ice in 1963 had melted out of the ice and lay on the glacier surface in 1964, but the horizontal position of all but one of them could be recovered within a foot or two by taking the center of a small circle of painted rocks originally piled around them. Although toppling of the stakes pre\u00ad vented direct measurement of ablation and of the amount of vertical movement, ablation must have ex\u00ad ceeded 1.5 feet-the depth to which the stakes were originally driven. There was no indication that the stakes or the rocks piled around them affected the rate of ablation. So that their further movement can be determined in subsequent years, each of the 1963 stakes was redriven in its 1964 position. REED B139 1000 0 I I 6.

The profiles show that the glacier in September 1964 was generally from 1 to 3 feet thinner along the original line of markers than about 13 months earlier, in August 1963. The terminus of the glacier remained in virtually the same position in 1964 as in 1963. A thickening of the upper part of the glacier noted in 1963 (Reed, 1964) has not yet af\u00ad fected the profile at the line of section, and at the present rate of horizontal movement would not be expected to do so for several decades. The change in altitude of th~ ice surface at the original markers between 1963 and 1964 represents the loss due to ablation and the descent due to downhill movement. For all markers the change in altitude exceeds the difference between the 1963 and 1964 profiles, which demonstrates a downward com\u00ad ponent of movement, but lack of ablation data prevents a determination of the inclination of the movement with respect to the ice surface. Direction and amount of horizontal movement are surprisingly consistent across nearly the entire width of the glacier and are independent of the local slope of the ice surface. Points near the edges moved almost as rapidly as points near the center (table 1). The sur\u00ad face ice in this part of the glacier apparently moves as a nearly rigid mass, and differential movement is mostly confined to narrow zones at the sides (and presumably to a zone at the base) . The rate of horizontal movement is comparable to rates reported by Alden ( 1923), Gibson and Dyson ( 1939), and Johnson ( 1964) for the Grinnell Glacier in Glacier National Park, but it is unexpectedly rapid for such a small glacier in a region of much lower pre\u00ad cipitation. The maximum movement measured by W al\u00ad drop (1964) in the Arapaho Glacier, Colorado, was only about 12 feet per year. Apparently the glacier is nearly in equilibrium (Reed, 1964). W. B. Myers (oral communication, 1964) has pointed out that such rapid movement therefore suggests that the ice must be relatively thin, in order to arrive at any reasonable mass budget for the glacier. The thickness can be calculated by considering basal shear stress as a function of the cross-sectional geometry of the glacier. Meier (1960, p. 39), following Nye (1952, p. 85), stated the general relation in the form (1) where u is the shear stress at depth Z below the center line, 'Y is the specific weight of ice, R is the hydraulic radius of the section, d is the total depth, and a is the Bl40 670 E 660 .a <a \"C 650 Q)\u00ad> Q) _g.!!! 640 <a 1: from mark south wall, in feet A.

Surface slope and change in elevation of the ice sur\u00ad face near the middle of the profile were estimated from contour maps of the glacier in 1954 and 1963 (Reed, 1964, fig. 1). These data and ice thickneses calculated from equation 2 are given in table 3. The thicknesses, less than 50 feet, seem rather small, but they are sur\u00ad prisingly consistent in view of the uncertainties in\u00ad volved in the estimates of slope and change in sur\u00ad face elevation. Even if they are of only the correct order of magnitude, they support the inference that the central part of the Teton Glacier is very thin. This may explain the lack of internal plastic flow in the movement profile (fig. 3). Direct measurements of surface slope and change in elevation along the profile in the future may allow more reliable estimates of ice thickness.

GEOLOGICAL SURVEY RESEARCH 1965 USE OF MAGNETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY AND GRAIN DENSITY IN IDENTIFICATION OF BASALT FLOWS AT THE NEVADA TEST SITE By K. A. SARGENT/ Denver1 Colo. Work done in cooperation with the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission Abstract.-Two lithologically similar groups of olivine basalt flows were distinguished by plotting magnetic susceptibility versus grain density. The identification was found to be more rapid than, and as accurate as, that based upon petrogravhic criteria alone. l\\{agnetic susceptibility and grain-density analyses proved to be useful criteria for identifying two basalt groups of very similar appearance and lithology. The groups studied occur in the Jackass Flats and Skull l\\fountain quadrangles of the Nevada Test Site, N ye County, Nev. Each group is about 250 feet thick and consists of seven or more flows of olivine basalt of Ter\u00ad tiary age. The older unit is the basalt of Skull Moun\u00ad tain; the younger is the basalt of Kiwi Mesa. Mega\u00ad scopic separation of these units is impossible in outliers and outcrops where recognizable overlying or underly\u00ad ing rocks are not exposed. Petrographic data pro\u00ad vided useful criteria for identification, but magnetic susceptibilty versus grain-density plots were found to be as accurate and more rapid. PETROGRAPHY The basalts are generally similar in texture and com\u00ad position, except for. the presence of local quartz xeno\u00ad crysts in the basalt of Skull Mountain. in subordinate amounts. Quartz xenocrysts occur in many flows of the basalts of Skull Mountain. The xenocrysts are cor\u00ad Reaction rims sidic augite and brown glass (N <balsam) are present around the quartz.

Accessory hypersthene, and N < 1.53) is colorless to dark brown and gray and locally contains abundant fine-grained magnetite. Secondary minerals include iddingsite and hematite as major constituents and uralite, sericite, chalcedony, and calcite as minor constituents. Seventeen modal analyses based on 500 to 1,000 point counts are given in table 1. Figures in volume percent are reported to the nearest one-tenth percent. Although their mineralogical characteristics overlap, the basalts of Skull Mountain generally contain less \u00b7 groundmass plagioclase, more phenocryst plagioclase, more groundmass pyroxene, and less opaque material than those of Kiwi Mesa. A comparison (table 2) of the ratio\u00b7 of total plagi\u00ad oclase to total pyroxene plus olivine shows that basalts of Kiwi Mesa (with one exception) have a ratio of more than 2.5, while basalts of Skull Mountain have a ratio of less than 2.5. The exception is an aberrant basalt with nearly 40 percent of total olivine and pyroxene (KAS 5-23-3).

INTERPRETATION OF VARIATIONS IN PHYSICAL PROPERTIES Werner ( 1945, .p. 50) reports that the magnetic susceptibility of rocks is determined mainly by the mag\u00ad netite content. He also notes two observations perti\u00ad nent to this study: (1) susceptibility values show con\u00ad siderable scattering for similar volume percent of magnetite, and (2) the suspectibility decreases consid\u00ad erably faster magnetite content. Mooney and Bleifuss ( 1953) concur and further state that the scat\u00ad ter of susceptibility values probably results from varia\u00ad tions in shape and orientation of magnetite grains. Koenigsberger (1938, p. 123} reports that magnetic susceptibility decreases with decreasing grain size; how\u00ad ever, Mooney and Bleifuss (1953, p. 386} suggest an opposite trend.

The sample regression line shown SARGENT B145 on figure 2 indicates that magnetic susceptibility in\u00ad creases with increasing average grain size of opaque minerals and supports the view of Koenigsberger (1938, p. 123). This plot (fig. 2) and plots of grain density versus percentage of opaque minerals plus oli\u00ad vine (fig. 3), and of grain density versus percentage of glass (fig. 4) split the basalts into two fields. There is one aberrant point in each plot; however, none of these aberrant points refer to the same sample in the separate graphs.

The basalts of Kiwi Mesa probably have more of ~heir total iron in the form of magnetite, whereas the basalts of Skull Mountain either have less total iron or they have proportionately more of their iron tied up in less magnetic minerals such as pyroxene and olivine.2 These data indicate that magnetic susceptibility in these basalts varies directly with magnetic-mineral con\u00ad tent and with magnetic-mineral grain size. The use of magnetic susceptibility and grain density in correlation has been found to be of particular value where the flow in question occurred in an isolated outcrop and determinative field evidence is lacking.

EDWARD MANGER, Washington, D.C. Work done in cooperation with the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission A.bstract.-A study of the porosity of 10 selected specimens of lapilli tuff from the Nevada Test Site shows that (1) porosity based on water-displacement and mercury-displacement bulk volume differs by about 1 percent; (2) total and apparent po\u00ad rosity where based on the same bulk volume are virtually equal, but a seeming excess of total over apparent porosity arises be\u00ad cause the densities of the powdered portions of the test speci\u00ad mens are not typical of the grain densities of the whole speci\u00ad mens; and (3) the volume of sealed-off pores, including sealed\u00ad off vesicles, does not exceed 0.1 percent porosity. Because of the wide range in porosity, tests on 234 specimens would be neces\u00ad sary to obtain a mean porosity with a standard error of only 0.25 percent. For the evaluation of the effects of underground ex\u00ad plosions on the physical properties of tuff at the Nevada Test Site in southern Nevada, questions arose whether the methods used for the porosity determinations yielded the best values, whether vesicles that may be present represent sealed-off pores, and whether the po\u00ad rosity of large volumes of tuff is adequately represented by tests on a limited number of specimens. Experiments which were limited by field-laboratory conditions were performed on 10 specimens of lapilli tuff from subunit T of the bedded tuffs of the Paint\u00ad brush Tuff.1 The specimens are parts of a core obtained at a depth of about 400 feet from an air-drilled hole which extended laterally about 25 feet from a tunnel to a chamber which later served as the site for a nuclear / explosion. The core samples from which the test speci- mens were derived were irregularly spaced along the drill hole. TECHNIQUE Composition of test specimens The test specimens consisted of well-consolidated white lapilli tuff. The surfaces of the shaped test speci\u00ad mens were very fine grained and smooth. According 1 Formerly called subunit T of the Survey Butte Member of the Piapi Canyon Formation of the Oak Spring Group. to F. A. McKeown and D. D. Dickey (U.S. Geol. Sur\u00ad vey, written communication 1958), chalky white tuff with many lithic fragments is characteristics of subunit T. The lapilli tuff commonly contained dark rock frag\u00ad ments from less than 1 mm to 4 mm long, but fragments of such size were not present in the test specimens. R. E. Wilcox and Theodore Botinelly (U.S. Geol. Survey, written communication, 1958) report that the average tuff from subunit T (their specimen B-222) consists of 1.8 percent phenocrysts, 4.5 percent xenoliths, and 87.9 percent shards and lapilli. The 87.9 percent shards and lapilli consists of 35 percent heulandite, 8 percent cristobalite, 11 percent montmorillonite, and 34 percent amorphous material and crystalline material too fine for X-ray identification. Vesicles are stated to con\u00ad stitute 5.8 percent of the specimen. Additional work by Botinelly (written communication, 1961) shows that much of the heulandite is close to clinoptilolite in com\u00ad position but shows some variation in thermal and X-ray properties. The 1.2 percent of vesicles is near the mini\u00ad mum that has been reported for the Paintbrush Tuff. The actual test specimens were not examined micro\u00ad scopically. However, the laboratory measurements (see table) indicate that such mineralogical variation as was present resulted in a maximum of less than 9 percent variation about the mean of the measured grain-powder densities for all10 samples. The grains of the groundmass of the white lapilli tuff of subunit T are reported to fit closely together, and there is very little interstitial material (Wilcox and Botinelly, written communication, 1958). This close fit of the grains and the very small amount of interstitial material may explain the observed stability of the speci\u00ad mens in water. The elements of porosity determinations Total porosity is a measure of the total void volume of a rock and is the excess of bulk volume over grain volume, per unit of bulk volume. Experimentally, as B146 U.S. GEOL. SURVEY PROF. PAPER 525-B, PAGES Bl46-Bl50 MANGER B147 in this study, total porosity is usually determined as the excess of grain density over bulk density, per unit of grain density. Apparent porosity, often called effective or net porosity, is a measure of the apparent void vol\u00ad ume of a rock and is\u00b7 determined as the excess of bulk volume over grain volume and occluded pore volume, pe:r unit bulk \u00b7volume. The excess of bulk volume over grain volume and occluded pore volume, or apparent void volume, is determined by the fluid capacity of the permeable pores of the rock. Experimental procedure Sequential tests were run on 10 specimens. Pieces of core were shaped to rounded multiplaned specimens from about 4 em a to 7 em 3 in volume, and were free of reentrant surfaces. The specimens were ovendried at 105\u00b0C for 8 hours and cooled in a desiccator. A selected specimen 'vas weighed to 1 milligram. This measurement and all others were made to 4 significant figures. Bulk V'olume was determined as the volume of mercury displaced by the specimen from a heavy\u00ad walled cylindrical glass bottle provided with a center\u00ad hole glass stopper. While the stopper was being pressed in place, the specimen was kept submerged in the mer\u00ad cury and moved by means of a needle inserted through the stopper hole in order to release possibly entrapped air bubbles. The volume of the displaced me.rcury was obtained from its weight by a correction for an ambient temperature of about 25\u00b0C. When removed from the glass bottle the specimen was brushed to re\u00ad move the adhering mercury, redried in the oven for 2 hours at 105\u00b0C, cooled in the desiccator, and reweighed. The loss of weight given by the difference between the first and second dry weights represents attrition occur\u00ad ring during the determination of bulk volume by mer\u00ad cury displaeement. This loss of weight was considered to be proportional to the loss of volume and permitted correction of the mercury-displacement bulk volume in terms of the subsequently determined water-displace\u00ad ment bulk volume. The specimen '\"as then evacuated to less than 1 mm of mercury pressure in a glass desic\u00ad cator, which pressure was held for half an hour, after which enough de-aerated water was admitted to cover the specimen. Bubbling ceased in about 15 minutes, and, after an additional 15 minutes, the vacuum desic\u00ad cator was opened to the atmosphere :for at least 2 hours. On removal of the water-saturated specimen from the vacuum desiccator, the \"excess\" water was eliminated by touching the specimen with thoroughly moist absorb\u00ad ent pa.per, and the specimen was weighed as quickly as possible, to 1 milligram. Pore volume was determined as the weight of water absorbed, corrected to 4\u00b0C from an average ambient temperature of about 25\u00b0C. Im\u00ad mediately after the saturated specimen was weighed in ai~, its bulk volume was determined from the loss of weight by suspended immersion in previously boiled and cooled tapwater, with the loss of weight similarly corrected for the temperature of the immersing tap\u00ad water. The effect of dissolved solids on the specific gravity of the tapwater in which the samples were weighed was considered to be negligible, as a representa\u00ad tive sample of tapwater at the Nevada Test Site showed only 389 parts per million total dissolved solids (Alfred Clebsch, Jr., U.S. Geol. Survey, oral communication, 1958). Subsequent to the determination of the loss of weight in water, the specimen was ovendried at 105\u00b0C for 8 hours and cooled in a desiccator. A portion of the specimen was pulverized to yield a'bout 2 grams of powder for the determination of grain density in a 50- ml pycnometer with a side arm and a glass-stopper thermometer. Distilled water served as the pycnometer liquid. In order to de-aerate the powder, the mixture of water and powder was boiled in the pycnometer about 10 minutes. Temperature corrections for the density of the distilled water were made to 0.1 \u00b0C. For checking purposes, repeated sequential tests were made on several specimens. Conditions which interfere with obtaining the best val;ues of porosity There are a number of conditions which interfere with obtaining the best values of porosity. It is well known that the observed bulk volumes are method\u00ad dependent and that bulk volumes obtained by water displacement and mercury displacement rarely are equal. An excess of total over apparent porosity re\u00ad sults from the presence of occluded pores, but a spurious excess of total porosity results from the following inter\u00ad fering conditions: ( 1) significant adsorption of water by the grain powder during the pycnometric determina\u00ad tion of its volume, (2) incomplete saturation of per\u00ad meable pores during the determination of apparent pore volume, and (3) a density of the grain-powder portion of the specimen greater than the grain density of the whole specimen. According to the methods used in this study, the only known cause, other than measurement error, for a spurious and unreal deficiency of total porosity with respect to apparent porosity is that the density of the grain-powder portion of the specimen is less than the grain density of the whole specimen. RESULTS The bulk volume effect The data obtained by the experiments are shown in the accompanying table. For all10 specimens of lapilli tuff the means of total and apparent porosities based on water-displacement bulk densities or volumes exceed the means based on mercury-displacement bulk densities B148 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF ROCKS or volumes by about 1 percent porosity. For specimen No. 13, however, the total porosity based on mercury\u00ad displacement bulk density is in excess. This is due to a larger mercury than water-displacement bulk volume. The abnormally high grain-powder densities of speci\u00ad mens Nos. 10 and 11 apparently are due to the chance inclusion in the tuff of a fragment or of fragments of lapilli tuff or xenoliths of unusually high density. If these 2 specimens are omitted the porosities which are based on water displacement bulk volumes are in excess by about 0.8 percent porosity. Thus a difference of about 1 percent porosity is due to differences in the water-and mercury-displacement bulk volumes. Excess of total porosity due to occluded pores or to spurio.usly i\u00b7nd\u00b7icated oc.cluded pores The table shows that for all 10 specimens of lapilli tuff the mean excess of total over apparent porosity where based on water-displacement bulk density or volume is about 1 percent porosity. Similarly the mean excess of total over apparent porosity where based on mercury-displacement bulk volume is about 1 percent porosity. Although the mean total porosity is in excess, specimens Nos. 15, 2, 7, and 1 show unreal excesses of apparent porosity; these are specimens which in gen\u00ad eral show the lowest grain-powder densities. With the omission as before of the 2 specimens with the highest grain powder densities, the excess of total porosity for the remaining 8 specimens is reduced to 0.18 percent porosity. Thus the volume of occluded pores, or the spurious volume of occluded pores due to the mentioned interfering conditions, lies between 0.18 percent and 1 percent porosity. The preceding relations suggest that the excess of total porosity over apparent porosity depends upon the grain-powder density. This dependence is illustrated in figure 1, where the excess total porosity is plotted as a function of the grain-powder density. The dependence of the excess of total porosity over apparent porosity on the grain-powder density is expressed numerically (Ezekiel and Fox, 1959, p. 130) by the coefficient of determination ( r) where ( r) is the coefficient of cor\u00ad relation. The coefficient of determination shows the extent to which the variance in one variable is deter\u00ad mined by the variance in another variable. If the dependence is causal, the coefficient sho,vs the extent to which the variance in one variable is caused by the variance in another variable. Because repeat determi\u00ad nations of grain-powder density indicate that measure\u00ad ment error is not significant, the deficiencies of total porosity as shown by 4 of the 10 specimens are caused by the density of the powder portion of the speci1nen being lower than the grain density of the whole speci\u00ad men. The 10 specimens in the table show a mean excess of total porosity based on water-displacement bulk density over apparent porosity based on water-displacement bulk vo]ume of 0.96 percent and a coefficient of deter\u00ad mination of 0.88. Thus it is indicated that 0.88 of the 0.96 percent average excess of total over apparent poros\u00ad ity, or 0.84 percent excess total porosity, is caused by the fact that the powder densities are not typical of the specimen. Then 0.96 percent porosity less 0.84 percent porosity, or 0.12 percent porosity, represents the maxi\u00ad mum possible volume of occluded pores, or the maxi- Total and apparent porosity of lapilli tuff of subunit T of the Paintbrush Tuff from the Nevada Test Site in southern Nevada [Measurements by G.

Both total and apparent porosity are based on bulk volume as determined by water displacement. mum possible spurious volume of occluded pores due to the previously mentioned interfering conditions. In contrast to the large coefficient of determination shown by the relation of the excesses of total porosity over apparent porosity to grain-powder density, the coeffi\u00ad cient of determination for the total porosities with respect to grain-powder density is 0.07 and for apparent porosities with respect to grain-powder density, 0.06. With the 2 extremely high excesses of total porosity of figure 1 omitted, the mean of the excesses and defi\u00ad ciences of the remaining 8 specimens as previously stated is 0.18 percent porosity, and the coefficient of determination is 0.55. Accordingly, the maximum pos\u00ad sible volume of occluded pores, including those repre\u00ad sented by any vesicles which may be present, is 0.08 percent porosity. Grain density The mean value for the grain density of the specimens may be obtained from figure 1. After elimination of the 2 specimens with the highest grain-powder densities, the grain-powder densities of the remaining 8 speci~ mens are equally distributed about zero median excess total porosity. This distribution suggests that the excesses and deficiencies of total porosity are due to normal sampling error in the selection of portions of the specimens for the determination of grain-powder density, and that the mean grain density of the speci\u00ad mens is indicated at the point on the graph where the excess total porosity is zero. At zero excess total poros\u00ad ity the grain-powder density is 2.298 g em -3 with a standard error of the estimate (Sy\u00b7x) of 0.011 g cm-3, - 2;z2 where S~ \u00b7 x-n-2' with z=the excess of the actual over the estimated grain-powder density, and n= the number of observations, which in the present case is 10. Because at zero excess total porosity the total and apparent porosities are equal, the mean grain density may also be derived by use of the relation that the grain density is equal to the bulk density divided by 1 minus the fractional apparent porosity. By this rela\u00ad tion the same mean value of 2.298 g cm-3 is obtained for the grain density of the specimens, whether the relation is based on water-displacement bulk density and bulk volume or on mercury-displacement bulk density and bulk volume. CONCLUSIONS The smooth surfaces of the test specimens suggest that the best values of bulk volume, and therefore the best values of porosity, may be based on mercury\u00ad displacement bulk volume. The mean apparent poros\u00ad ity in the table of the 10 samples so based is 36.69 percent and the mean total porosity is 37.68 percent. In view of the fact that for 1 of the 10 specimens the mercury-displacement bulk volume exceeds the water\u00ad displacement bulk volume, a more conservative poros\u00ad ity may be based on an average of water-and mercury\u00ad displacement bulk volume; accordingly, the mean apparent porosity is 37.19 percent and the mean total porosity is 38.16 percent. Because in the present speci\u00ad mens of tuff the volume of occluded pores does not ex\u00ad ceed 0.12 percent porosity, and may be zero, the mean apparent porosity of 37.19 percent is considered to be the better value. Owing to the wide range in porosity of the 10 speci\u00ad mens of lapilli tuff as shown in the table, the standard error of the mean (SMx) is 1.21 percent, where SMx= s~, . -vn with Sx=standard deviation the items in the uni\u00ad verse, and n=the number of items in the sample, which in the present case is 10. To obtain a mean with a standard error of only 0.50 percent porosity would require tests on 59 specimens, and to obtain a mean with a standard error of 0.25 percent would require tests on 234 specimens. The methods used in this study excluded the effects of one interfering condition which should be 1nentioned. B150 PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF ROCKS For specimens of tuffaceous sandstone obtained from near the present specimens of la.pilli tuff, apparent porosity based on the volume of air evacuated from the test specimens exceeded apparent porosity based on the volume of absorbed water by 17 percent. Obviously, air should not be used as a measure of the pore volume of tuff from the Paintbrush Tuff. The specimens which were used in the porosity tests did not exceed 7 milliliters in bulk volume. Limiting the bulk volume to this value may have helped in ob-taining the indicated complete saturation of the evacu\u00ad ated specimens as a measure of pore volume. Boiling the mixture of grain powder and water evidently re\u00ad sulted in complete removal of entrapped or possibly adsorbed air in the pycnometrie determination of grain\u00ad powder density.

A.bstract.-An improved device using the photoneutron re\u00ad action Be\" (gamma-neutron) Be8 has been developed for the quantitative analysis of beryllium in crushed rock samples and solutions. The operating part is an annular-shaped chamber consisting, from center outward of a y-source, sample holder, lead y-shield, paraffin moderator, and a ring of low-voltage pro\u00ad portional counters. A remotely controlled pneumatic system is used to raise a 1-curie gamma source from storage below floor level to the center of the sensitive chamber for each analysis. A beryllium content of 1 ppm can be determined with a 400-g sample. Eaeh analysis requires approximately 5 minutes. Several instruments using the Be9 (gamma-neutron) Be8 reaction for Vaughn, 1960; Mezhiborskaya, 1962). The principal differences be\u00ad tween the earlier instruments and the instrument de\u00ad scribed here are the use of B10-lined low-voltage pro\u00ad portional counters for thermal neutron operated pneumatic \"rabbit\" system for han\u00ad dling the radioactive source safely and reliably, and an annular-shaped sensitive chamber. Detection is made possible by the fact that beryllium in a gamma flux of 1.66 million electron volts (minimum energy) is randomly converted to Be8 with the emission of a photo\u00ad neutron. The photoneutrons, decreased in energy to thermal range, can be counted and the results converted to a value of beryllium by comparison with a standard calibration curve. The equipment developed by the U.S. Geological Survey has been in use for approximately 4 years. A minimum amount of maintenance has been required, and the only equipment replaced has been the radio\u00ad active isotope (Sb124), which has a useful life of about 4 months. Solid and liquid calibration standards have been carefully prepared. Each standard weighs 400 grams and is permanently sealed in aluminum contain\u00ad ers identical with those used for sample analysis (see fig. 1). The analytical time depends somewhat on the GEOLOGICAL SURVEY 'RESEARCH 1965 GAMMA ACTIVATION DEVICE FOR LOW-LEVEL BERYLLIUM ANALYSIS By WILLIAM W. VAUGHN, WILLIAM G. CRAMER, and WILLIAM N.

Except for being crushed to 14-inch size, the solid samples are untreated and are not subjected to contamination by extensive preparation procedures~ The liquids are usually laboratory solutions, but sam\u00ad ples taken directly from natural waters and contained in a polyethylene bottle are easily accon1modated. Most of the determinations made with the instrument have been made using solid sample material. The Be analyzer has served a twofold purpose in our geologie program: (a) the arbitrary classification by beryllium content of a large number of untreated rock and alluvium samples, and (b) the detailed study of the distribution of beryllium in the parts per million range in a given geologic environment. The reproducibility and accuracy of the quantitative determinations made with the beryllium analyzer com\u00ad pare favorably with results from wet chemieal methods and emission spectrography. The large sample size, which assures a representative analysis, and the freedom from matrix effects, inherent in spectrographic methods, are m1ique advantages of this teehnique. Brief studies were made of interferenee from naturally occurring neutron absorbers, such as lithium and boron, and from density contrast in natural rock. Neither effect is con\u00ad sidered serious in geologic studies.

With a high-voltage setting of 667 volts on the counter tubes, thermal neutrons will produce pulses with ap\u00ad proximately 4 millivolts amplitude at R1 A conventional scaler with an input sensitivity variable down to 1 mv is adequate for this instrument technique. It is desirable to have a well-regulated power source, and the room temperature should be con\u00ad trolled to +5\u00b0 F. The only background interference is due to cosmic radiation and amounts to approximately 70 counts per minute. CALIBRATION Typical calibration curves for liquid and solid stand\u00ad ards are shown in figure 4. Both curves are virtually linear; however, the solid standard gives a higher count\u00ad ing rate per unit value of beryllium, probably because of the greater absorption of neutrons in the liquid. Liquid samples are advantageous over solid material, however, because of their low density contrast and homogeneity. Sb124 GAMMA SOURCE The antimony source pellet is fabricated and thoroughly tested for physical defects before it is irradi\u00ad ated and becomes a radioisotope. Solid metallic anti\u00ad mony of commercial grade is sealed with a heliarc weld in a stainless steel (type 347) case (fig. 1). The case and weld are surfaced with an abrasive polishing com\u00ad pound to a satin finish and heated to 1000\u00b0F. After cooling, the weld is inspected visually with a micro\u00ad scope. In ttddition the capsule may be tested for leaks under vacuum by immersion in water. The capsule is then irradiated in a reactor to the specified 1-curie intensity.

The antimony before activation has a natural relative abundance of 57.25 percent of Sb121 and 42.75 percent of Sb123 On activation the Sb121 becomes radioactive Sb122, which decays rapidly to stable Te122 The Sb12a becomes radioactive Sb124 and similarly by beta-gamma decay becomes stable Te124; however, there are two iso\u00ad meric short-lived forms of Sb'2\\ one of which may by transition through gamma emission become Sb124 with a 60-day half life; the other may decay directly by beta emission to Te124 The Sb124 with 60-day half life, which is the principal isomeric form, provides the gamma rays for the photoneutron ( y-n) reaction with beryllium (Bradford, 1953). The threshold for neutron yield from the beryllium atom is 1.63 Mev, and many of the gammas from Sb124 are above this threshold. Although it is possible to re\u00ad lease neutrons from beryllium with other forms of atomic projectiles, antimony is particularly suitable as a gamma-emitting isotope because of its convenient half life, low cost, and availability. The gamma activation or photoneutron method of detecting and analyzing for beryllium can be adapted to many special situations. Specifically the technique can be applied to borehole logging, to continuous sample or ore scanning, to specific small-size sample analysis [this last apparatus would use solid-state components and the Be9 (a-n)03 reaction]. Some of these applications al\u00ad ready have been used by the Geological Survey, and work and development along these lines will continue. REFERENCES Bradford, J.

GEOLOGICAL SURVEY \u00b7RESEARCH 1965 USE OF X-RAY FLUORESCENCE IN DETERMINATION OF SELECTED MAJOR CONSTITUENTS IN SILICATES By HARRY j. ROSE, JR., FRANK CUTTITTA, and RICHARD R. LARSON, Washington, D.C. Abstract.-An X-ray fluorescence method is described for the quantitative determination of Ah<>a, total iron, CaO, K20, Ti02, and MnO in milligram amounts of silicates. Sample solutions are adsorbed on powdered chromatographic paper, the paper is dried and pelletized, and then exposed to the X-ray beam. Par\u00ad ticle-size, absorption, and enhancement effects common to the analysis of powered samples are eliminated, the method being generally applicable to elements with Z>12. Furthermore, standards are easily prepared from solutions of pure metals or oxides to cover the anticipated analytical range. Working curves are linear, with detection limits being in the microgram and submicrogram level. Results for these elements are com\u00ad parable to those obtained by analysts for diabase W-1 and granite G-1. The method can be used for the microanalysis of major constituents in very small amounts of geologic and extra\u00ad terrestrial materials such as rocks, minerals, impactites, tektites, and meteorites. A switching arrangement which greatly fa\u00ad cilitates the use of a single electronic array for both the vacuum and controlled-atmosphere spectrometers is also presented. The search for techniques that can increase analytical capabilities, especially in quantitative micro-to semi\u00ad microanalysis, is a continuing effort in U.S. Geological Survey laboratories. Analysis of geologic and extra\u00ad terrestrial materials such as impactities, chondrules, tektites, minerals, and phase separates of meteorites and rocks often requires microanalytical techniques because of limited sample size. Semimicro determinations of the major constituents (Si02, Al202, total iron, Ti02, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy using 50- milligram samples have been reported by Rose and others (1964). This procedure has been used to analyze a wide variety of geologic materials, and the method has been found applicable to quantities as small as 25 mg. However, this amount represents a practical lower limit for the L~B40 7 La20s fusion technique (Rose and others, 1962, 1963), particularly for the analysis of ele\u00ad ments of low atomic number. Yet, in many instances, compositional data are needed where the total amount of material being studied is much less than 25 mg, espe\u00ad cially when rare mineral specimens or scarce extra\u00ad terrestrial materials are involved. A method has been developed in which solution techniques combined with X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy are applied to the quantitative determination of Al20s, total iron, K20, CaO, Ti02, and MnO in milligram amounts of silicates. Many of the problems inherent in the X-ray fluores\u00ad cence analysis of powdered samples (Claisse, 1956; An\u00ad dermann, 1961; Rose and others, 1962), such as particle size, crystal structure, and matrix effects due to absorp\u00ad tion and enhancement, \u00b7are eliminated by the presenta\u00ad tion to the X-ray beam of a homogeneous specimen in the form of sample solution adsorbed onto commercially available powdered chromatographic paper (powdered cellulose), dried at 80\u00b0C, and pelletized on a cellulose backing. Solution techniques also offer a means of sep\u00ad arating or concentrating very low levels of elements of interest by precipitation with a carrier, by extraction, or by microelectrolytic methods. Furthermore, in addition to using reference standards such as granite G-1, diabase W-1, and National Bureau of Standards standard samples, standards as needed are easily prepared from solutions of pure metals or oxides which may be combined in varying proportions to cover the anticipated analytical range. Experimental data show that calibration curves are linear, with determi\u00ad nation and detection limits at the microgram and sub\u00ad microgram levels, respectively. The oxide concentra\u00ad tion present in the samples is obtained from the calibra\u00ad tion curves relating X-ray intensity to chemical com\u00ad position. INSTRUMENTATION Two single-channel X-ray spectrometers were used, one an air-or helium-path unit equipped with a plati\u00ad num target X-ray tube, and the other a vacuum spec\u00ad trometer having a dual-target (chromium and tungsten) B155-B159 0 -65 -11 B156 ANALYTICAL TABLE !.-Operating conditions for X-ray fluorescence analysis Element 13A1-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -2&Fe 2 Ka1 reflection used. X-ray tube. The platinum target was used for the de\u00ad termination of Fe203, MnO, and Ti02 and the chrom\u00ad ium target for CaO, K20, and Al20s. A switching arrangement, described below, was devised that greatly facilitated the use of a single electronic array for both spectrometers. A constant-potential source operating at 50 kilovolts and 40 milliamperes was used. A pulse\u00ad height analyzer was used with a 4.5-volt base level, a 12-v window, and a line pulse adjusted to 7.5 v. Count\u00ad ing times were selected by determining the interval re\u00ad quired to attain reasonable statistics on the lowest stand\u00ad ard for each element. The operating conditions, crystals used, and other pertinent data are given in table 1. Because fluorescent radiation of elements hav\u00ad ing atomic numbers z...::::::22 is absorbed by air, the spec\u00ad trometer sample chamber is flushed with helium for the determination of elements in the range Z ~2 but > 12 where Z = 12 is the cutoff for detection by this method. In order to allow the system to come to equili\u00ad brium between sample changes, it is advisable to flush the sample chamber for about 1 minute. Only a single electronic console, which provides ac\u00ad cessory power and electronic readout circuits, is neces\u00ad sary to operate the two spectrometers. Because the two spectrometers have identical electrical requirements, a relay-switching circuit was devised to provide an auto\u00ad matic and instantaneous switchover. Such an arrange\u00ad ment eliminates the time-consuming changing of cable connections that invariably contributes to the failure of one or more of the circuits. As shown in figure 1, the switch consists of three four-pole, double-throw relays for the power and volt\u00ad age circuits and a coaxial relay to handle the signal circuits. All the relays are actuated from a single tog\u00ad gle switch mounted on the front panel of the console. Connectors were mounted on the back panel of the con\u00ad sole to accommodate all the cables from the spectrom\u00ad eters. There is one precaution that should be observed. Al\u00ad though heavy-duty relays were selected, the high volt\u00ad age to the detector tube should be turned off before switching from one spectrometer to the other, to pre\u00ad vent arcing at the contacts.

DISCUSSION AND RESULTS Optimum ratio of solution to absorbent Figure 2 presents data for titania, showing the in\u00ad crease in counting rate as the ratio of absorbent to solution is decreased (curve A). The sample weight was kept constant by absorbing 1 ml of a solution of GW-1 (1.54 mg/ml) on 100-, 200-, 300-, 400-, and samples of powdered cellulose. Although the in\u00ad tensites are higher with smaller quantities of a,bsorbent, the optimum ratio of solution to absorbent is 1 ml to 500 mg, a, ratio that just provides complete absorption of the sample solution.

One\u00ad milliter aliquots containing 1, 2, 3, and 4 mg of ooch of three reference standards (granite G-1, diabase W-1, and a 1 : 1 mixture of G-1 and W -1) were processed by the solution-pellet method, and the resultant X-ray counting rates were related to the titania content of the samples. The data show that even a fourfold change , in sample weight has little or no effect upon the linearity of the concentration-intensity relation. This direct cor\u00ad relation is also implied in curve B (fig. 2), where the data shown in curve A were replotted to represent the counting rates associated with the titania content (in ~ 600 ~ 0 (.) w en 0::: 500 - w 0... en ~ 400 :::> 0 (.) z 300 - ~ 1- ~ 200 - w 1-z ~ 100 0::: x EXPLANATION o Diabase W-1 Granite G-1 6 GW (1: 1 mixture of G-1 and W-1) y 10 15 20 25 30 Ti02, IN MICROGRAMS 35 40 45 FIGURE 3.-X-ray intensity as a function of variable sample weight of Ti.Os for constant weight of absorbent (500 mg). micrograms) per 100 mg of the sample-impregnated absorbent. Effect of variable co:mposition Effects arising from the variability of composition of silicate samples might have been expected to sig\u00ad nificantly interfere with the accurate determination of oxide concentrations in an unknown sample. A suite of analyzed silicates (granite, diabase, tektites, and syn\u00ad thetic glasses) was processed using a constant amount (500 mg) of absorbent and sample weights ranging from 4 to 10 mg. These reference materials represent a variable silica content ranging from 45 to 87 ;percent. The data for titania are presented in figure 4. The linearity of the curve indicates that variations in com\u00ad position of silicate samples have little or no effect upon the direct correlation of the oxide concentration with the X-ray fluorescence intensity. The lack of compositional effects may be attributed to the fact that the sample submitted to the X-ray beam is virtually powdered cellulose, and as such, the role of the sample matrix on X-ray absorption or en\u00ad hancement is reduced to a minimum.

GEOLOGICAL SURVEY RESEARCH 1965 THE PROBLEM OF AUTOMATIC PLATE READING AND COMPUTER INTERPRETATION FOR SPECTROCHEMICAL ANALYSIS By A. W. HELZ, Washington, D.C. A.bstra.ct.-The problem of completely automating spectrum\u00ad plate reading and interpretation is discussed. Spectrochemi\u00ad cal analyses of geologic rna terials by such means would bene\u00ad fit from the use of more of the data recorded in the spectrum than is feasible by manual methods. Increased speed and ac\u00ad curacy could be expected to result. Quantitative spectrochemical analysis is based upon the determination of the intensity of a spectral line either relative to some other spectral line or background, or to the same spectral line produced under known standardized conditions. Spectral-line intensities are measured with highest precision by the direct use of multiplier phototubes. Because of the necessity of in\u00ad tegrating the intensities over an extended exposure time, the apparatus required for this increases in complexity as the number of lines to be observed increases. For the analytical problem where the primary objec\u00ad tive is the determination of many elements rather than the attainment of the highest precision on a few, the photographic plate is without peer because of its ability to record 10,000 lines simultaneously. In an analytical scheme in which many elements are sought, the spec\u00ad trographer, for practical reasons, makes use of only a fraction of the information displayed on a photograph of a spectrum. There is just too much information to use effectively. For elements in concentrations above the limits just detectable, lines in addition to the most sensitive come into view. The relative intensities for the lines of any one element present at fixed concentra\u00ad tion are not constant, but depend upon the excitation conditions, which in turn are dependent not only upon the energy input to the source but also on the kind and amounts of other elements present, their chemical com\u00ad bination, and physical state. The same statement also applies to the intensity of a line for any one element relative to the intensity of lines for every other element present in the source. An analytical determination could be improved if more of the information in a spectrum were used than is practical now. One can conceive of a computer, with its facility for handling very large amounts of data extremely rapidly, that would base a decision on the concentration of any one element on all of the observ\u00ad able lines for that element, and include corrections for the concentrations of all other elements present, major and minor, and for perhaps arc conditions based on carbon lines, cyanogen bands, and other concomitant factors. Much of the information needed for such a computational problem is not as elusive as may seem at first; it may be found in spectra of analyzed standards. By using a sufficient variety of standards covering all pertinent combinations of concentrations of major and minor elements, the essential reference data are a vail\u00ad able. The critical features are the large amount of data to be handled and the high precision needed for trans\u00ad ferring the information from the spectrum to a form suitable for computer handling. If 60 elements are sought in the analysis the computer may have stored information on more than the mini\u00ad mum number of spectral lines, perhaps twice as many. This opportunity to handle a greater amount of data is the chief -advantage sought. The data consist of ( 1) wavelengths (for identification), (2) the relation be\u00ad tween line intensity and concentration for each line, ( 3) the relation between percent transmission of the de\u00ad veloped photographic line and the intensity of the radia\u00ad tion that produce the image, and ( 4) corrections for background, emission source, spectral interferences, and matrix and interelement effects. AVAILABLE APPARATUS Computer development and precise and rapid data reading from photographs sufficient for handling the above problem have been demonstrated in numerous U.S. GEOL. SURVEY PROF. PAPER 525-B, Bl60-Bl64 B160 HELZ Bl61 other applications. Anderson and Moser (1958) de~ scribe the use of a computer for converting spectro\u00ad graphic-line transmittances to element concentrations with an improvement over manual methods in both speed and reliability. These authors start with manu\u00ad ally selected lines and transmittancy measurements. A similar example of the use of a computer for completing spectrochemical calculations is given by Schalge and others ( 1964). A table is supplied by the computer giving information on not only the concentrations of the elements but also error estimates and initial data. Tunnicliff and Weaver (1964) extend the computer handling of manually collected data to include correc\u00ad tions for interferences frmn other elements and to choos\u00ad ing the \"best\" value to report for each element. Their program was used routinely for determining 15 ele\u00ad ments, with gains in economy and accuracy. There are a number of commercially available direct\u00ad reading spectrometers-that include automatic data com\u00ad putation. Calibration curves and corrections for inter\u00ad element interferences are electronically represented, and results are given directly in percentage composition. Computer handling of data such as illustrated above starts with input data of specific spectral lines and with either the corresponding \"blackness\" on the photograph\u00ad ic plate or the output of a photomultiplier tube. The Initial problem of data collecting requires rapid highly precise instrumentation for either ( 1) measuring all the lines in a spectrum or ( 2) measuring a predeter\u00ad mined set of lines selected from the large number pres\u00ad ent. An example of method (1) above, recording all spectral lines with high accuracy, is given by Steinhaus and Engleman, 1 who described a comparator and digital computer programmed to find and measure spectral lines recorded on photographic plates. A precision densi\u00ad tometer and linear comparator supply the computer with a list of optical transmission values at equal inter\u00ad vals ( 1 or 5 microns) along the spectrum. More than 200 lines per minute are measured with a precision better than 0.1p. for sharp lines 25p. wide. Four line shapes are distinguished: symmetrical, shaded toward longer wavelength, shaded toward shorter wavelength, and wide lines. The second method of data collecting, measuring a predetermined set of lines, would reduce the amount of data collected before involving the computer. This method is more exacting in that an instrument is re\u00ad quired to measure transmittancies at numerous pre\u00ad selected spectral positions regardless of the actual pres- 1 D. W.

High -speed counting and switching sys\u00ad tems as well as other programming devices are available for accomplishing such a reading schedule. A brief survey of the factors that indicate the size and complexity of the problem follows. FACTORS AFFECTING AUTOMATIC PLATE READING AND COMPUTE\u00b7R INTERPRETATION Choice of spectral lines In a procedure for the quantitative spectrochemical analysis of rocks, ores, and minerals, Bastron and others (1960) list 154 spectral lines commonly employed, along with the useful concentration ranges. Not all useful lines are included and not all the lines listed are used in an analysis. Variations in excitation techniques and sample materials determine the choice. However, the list suffices to illustrate the problems involved. In total number of lines, the table is not much different from that ultimately required. In table 1 the lines given in the above reference are arranged in order according to wavelength-as they would appear in a spectrum. (Potentially useful lines in the cyanogen region have been added.) The calcu\u00ad lated spacing of the lines as obtained with a high dis\u00ad persion grating spectrograph is also shown. The table was arranged specifically to illustrate several aspects of the problem. Uneven distribution of spectral lines The irregular spacing of the special lines imposes stringent but attainable requirements for the precise location and rapid response of the microphotometer for recording the lines. A constant-velocity traveling mi\u00ad croscope is envisioned for recording percent transmis\u00ad sion of the lines. If 5 minutes is taken as a reasonable time for scanning a 20-inch spectral length and a line width of 25p. is assumed, then the transmission of lines must be recorded at a rate greater than 68 readings per second in order to measure 2 lines just touching each other, or to record the transmission during the time for traversing 1 spectral line.

Two very different methods for atta.cking the problem of an uneven distribution of spectral lines in plate read\u00ad ing are suggested : ( 1) The microphotometer may be programn1ed to record the transmission every time it reaches a position along the spectrum where a line is calculated to be. In this approach it cannot be assumed that all positions can be calculated from a single start\u00ad ing point. For various reasons there may be \"stretch\u00ad ing\" errors frmn one spectrun1 to the next. These errors may be minimized experimentally or may be compensated for by the use of a number of fiducial points within the spectrum for length compensation. These points may be obtained by incorporating an in\u00ad ternal standard eleinent in the spectrum source. ( 2) One could transfer the selection problen1 to the compu\u00ad ter. The microphotometer is arranged to record the transmission at equal intervals of length along the spectrum. For lines 25 fL 'vide, readings taken every 5 p. would supply good reading definition. Thus 101,600 readings would be required for 20 inches of spectrum. For the previously assumed time of 5 Ininutes for read\u00ad ing the entire spectrum, 339 readings per second would be required, a high but not impossible speed. Too little space between spectral lines In searehing through table 1, column 5, for lines 2 line-width units apart or less ( 0.05 mm), (assuming this to be the limiting practical resolution) 5 occurrences are noted: Ni 3065 Pt, Be 3131 Tm, Hf 3135 Er 3221 Ir, and Sr 3465 Re. Table~ 2 shows the pertinent data on these lines given by Bastron and others (1960). If the Inierophotometer gave a positive indication above speetral background at 3064-.7, for example, are Ni, Pt, TABLE 2.-Close pairs of analytical lines Element Line wavelength Concentration range (angstroms) (weight percent) ----- Ni _________________________ 3414. 76 0. 0002-0. 01 3050. 82 . 001 -. 1 3101. 55 . 001 -. 1 1 3064. 62 . 01 -.5 Pt _________________________ 2659. -1 1 3064. 71 . 001 -1 Be 2348. 61 0. 0001-0. 001 3130. 42 . 0005-. . 001 -. 05 Hf _________________________ 2866. 3134. .2 Er _________________________ 3230. 58 0.

B164 ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES or both present~ This first example illustrates the ad\u00ad vantage of the multiplicity of data.. It will be noted that the above question can be answered from informa.\u00ad tion supplied by the other lines for Ni and Pt, provided that there are no other interferences. For Er-Ir, ac\u00ad cording to table 2 there is no multiple choice. Actually as noted in a more extensive table (National Bureau of Standards Monograph 32) the iridium spectrum has a number of lines nearly as strong at 2544A, 2925A, 3133A, 3514A, 3800A, and so forth, with decreasing intensity. If no solution were available here to resolve the confusion between Er and Ir, a knowledge of the material being analyzed may serve as a discriminatory guide. For geologic materials, geochemical reasoning indicates that Ir is likely to be present if other elements of the platinum group are detected, that is Pt, Pd, Os, Rh, or Ru. Er is indicated if other members of the same rare-earth group or Yare present. Interfering elements Whether or not one spectral line interferes with an\u00ad other depends not only on their proximity but also on their relative intensities, kind of excitation, and nature of the sample material. The following discussion is restricted to the use of a d-e carbon are in silicate rock analysis for which' these data were compiled. A sample differing much from a normal silicate rock may require special care to avoid misinterpretation because of line interferences. A number of possible interferences are noted in the last column of table 1. As in the previous section, a definitive result almost always is available because of the multiplicity of data. For example, the first entry on table 1 indicates that Zr 2348.59A may interfere with Be 2348.61A. If this were so, the much stronger lines Zr 3273.05, Zr 3391.98, and Zr 2752.21 would of the beryllium lines 3130.42 or 3131.07 would be relied upon, depending upon the absence of other potential interferences with those lines. This is determinable by repeating the same procedure for the newly selected beryllium line. SUMMARY A spectrum interpretation procedure as proposed here would entail the following steps: ( 1) Record the percent transmission for (a) every 5p. of spectrum or (b) a selected set of spectral lines. (2) If ehoice 1a is made for nlat.e readin.q, then pro-gram a computer to select the required set of spectral lines resulting in a tabulation of wavelengths and per\u00ad cent transmissions. ( 3) Correct percent transmission for spectral back\u00ad ground and excitation errors. ( 4) Select the best line for each element. This in\u00ad volves the complex interplay of interferences noted above. ( 5) Calculate the intensity of each of the selected lines relative to an internal standard line or spectral background. Plate-calibration data a~ used for this to define the relation between percent transmission and intensity. ( 6) Calculate concentration of the elements, using stored data to define the relation between intensity and concentration for each of the lines. The problems of applying automatic data acquisition and computational methods to the spectrochemical de\u00ad termination of many elements in geologic materials stem from the large amount of data to be handled. The required plate-reading speed and accuracy have been attained in other applications, and similar data-storing, rapid -access, sorting, and calculating problems have been handled with computers. The complete automation of spectrum-reading and interpretation appears fantastically complex because of the large number of elements, multiplicity of spectral lines, and many additional variables of interfering ele\u00ad ments, matrix compositions, and excitation conditions. Many simplifications would be found and compromises made in a serious attack on the problem. Developments along these lines are encouraged by the possibilities of eliminating much manual labor and obtaining a better analysis, through the use of much more of the informa\u00ad tion recorded in a spectrum, than is now possible.

GEOLOGICAL SURVEY 'RE'SEARCH 1965 A PLATINUM-LINED BOMB FOR THE HIGH-TEMPERATURE DECOMPOSITION OF REFRACTORY MINERALS By IRVING MAY, j. j. ROWEl and RAYMOND LETNER, Washington, D.C. Abstract-A platinum-lined bom.b is described for high~tem\u00ad perature acid decomposition of small mineral samples for chem\u00ad ical analysis. The apparatus consists of an easily removable platinum-lined Nichrome crucible which is inserted into a Morey-type bomb. As the crucible can be removed from the bomb while still sealed, there is little danger of contaminating the sample solution. No failures have occurred with runs up to 425\u00b00 and pressures of approximately 6,000 psi. Obtaining complete decomposition is a major problem in the \u00b7analysis of refractory minerals. Nearly all such minerals can be decomposed by acids at high tempera\u00ad tures. Such decompositions are performed best in bombs capable of withstanding not only high tempera\u00ad tures and pressures but also the corrosive effects of acids. Bombs suitable for these decompositions should have acid-resistant liners such as platinum or Teflon. Plati\u00ad num is preferred to Teflon because it can be used at tem\u00ad peratures higher than the maximum of about 260\u00b0C possible with Teflon. The platinum-lined bomb shown on figure 1 has been used by us for the decomposition with hydrofluoric acid and hydrofluoric plus sulfuric acids of small mineral samples for semimicroanalysis. The bomb is similar in 8ome respects to one used by Von Schloemer (1962) and consists of a removable reaction vessel which is inserted into a Morey-type bomb. A novel feature is the construction of the reaction ves\u00ad sel, which is a platinum-lined Nichrome crucible having an outside taper for facilitating its removal from the bomb body. The crucible can be weighed conveniently on an analytical balance before and after a. run. As the crucible can be removed from the bomb without break\u00ad ing the platinum seal there is little danger of contami\u00ad nating the sample solution during transfer of the solution from the crucible. The body of the crucible, made of Nichrome, protects the platinum liner from mechanical damage during in-sertion and removal from the bomb body, made of Hasteloy, and from chemical contamination by the Hasteloy. Removal of the crucible at the termination of .a run is aided not only by its taper but also by the projecti?n of the crucible through . a hole in the bottom of the Steel cap_.

PAPER 525-B, Bl65-Bl66 B165 B166 ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES Hasteloy body. This enables the direct application of pressure with a press for releasing the crucible. The volume of the crucible is 3\u00a52 milliliters, which permits the use of sample weights of as Inuch as 100 milligrams and acid volumes of 1 to 2 ml. Temperatures as high as 425\u00b0C have been used for bomb runs with pressures estimated as high as 6,000 pounds per square inch. Pressures were estimated from the temperature and degree of filling, using Bridgman's tables. The bomb has proven to be very reliable. No :failures of the bomb nor of the platinum liner have occurred after 35 runs for periods of 16 to 24 hours each with a variety of oxide and silicate minerals. Sealing the crucible is effected by the pressure exerted by tightening the cap against the plunger. The plunger is pushed against an annealed copper washer which transmits the thrust to the pia tin urn sealing disk. The body of the bomb is made of Hasteloy -C and is cylindrical except for two flat surfaces which enable its being held in a vise for sealing and opening of the bomb. The main bore has a taper of 1%0 included angle. Two threaded diameters (eight threads per inch) provides a doubling of thread with a given travel of the cap (Morey and Hesselgesser, 1952). The cap, which is made of No. 4140 steel, is threaded to make a loose fit with the body. The top of the cap is cut to a 2%6-inch hexagonal nut. Pure platinum was used in the original liner because a massive piece was available in the laboratory. A 20- percent iridium alloy of platinum is more resistant to deformation and was used in a, newly constructed cru\u00ad cible. The wall of the liner is l;16 inch thick, the lip is %6 in deep, and the outside diameter of the liner is 3%4 inch. The weight of the platinum is approximately 65 grams. The inside bore of the Nichrome crucible is straight sided with a rounded bot1tom to make a press fit with the platinum liner. The outside diameter is tapered to match the bomb body; a shoulder on the base of the cru\u00ad cible makes contact with the inside shoulder of the bomb cavity. The base of the crucible protrudes l;10 inch from the bottom of the bomb. Prior to insertion of the liner, a vent hole is drilled with a No. 80 drill through one side of the Nichrome crucible near the bottom. The vent releases air and n1oisture entrapped between the platinum and nichrome, thereby preventing deforma\u00ad tion of the liner. The plunger, made of No. 304 stainless steel, fits freely in the bomb body and is counterbored at the bot\u00ad tom to hold a copper washer. Near the top of the plunger are two parallel flat surfaces for easy manipu\u00ad lation of the plunger with a wrench. The top of the plunger is threaded for a nut which is used when neces\u00ad sary for extracting the plunger by turning the nut against a short piece of tubing inserted over the plunger between the cap and the nut. The copper washer is made of oxygen-free copper and the platinum disk, 0.006 inch thick, of pure plati\u00ad num. Loose-fitting stainless-steel spacers are used as required. Before making a run, the lip of the platinum liner, the lower surface of the copper washer, and the upper surface of the platinum disk are coated with Aquadag to prevent the metal surfaces from sticki~g together. After a run, the bomb is permitted to cool to room temperature and the cap is removed with a wrench. The crucible is freed by setting the bomb body in a hydraulic press and gently exerting pressure until the crucible is released. The platinum disk sealing the cru\u00ad cible can usually be removed cleanly with gentle prying. The crucible, when being handled outside the bomb, is supported conveniently in a lightweight circular alum\u00ad inum holder with a center bore to fit the lower portion of the crucible.

GEOLOGICAL SURVEY RESEARCH 1965 RAPID FIELD AND LABORATORY DETERMINATION OF PHOSPHATE IN NATURAL WATER By MARVIN j. FISHMAN and MARVIN W. SKOUGSTAD, Denver, Colo. .Abstract.-This method is based on the formation and reduc\u00ad tion of phosphomolybdic acid by using a single-solution reagent prepared immediately before use by dissolving a measured amount of a mixture of dry chemicals consisting of ammonium molybdate, ascorbic acid, and antimonyl potassium tartrate in dilute sulfuric acid. In the presence of phosphate an intense blue color with maximum absorbance at 882 mJL develops within 10 minutes after addition of the reagent solution. Results are accurate to \u00b1lJLg PO . Soluble phosphate in water is usually determined quantitatively by a phosphomolybdate or \"molybdenum blue\" method based on the formation of phosphomolyb\u00ad dic acid, which, upon reduction, produces an intensely colored blue complex (Rainwater and Thatcher, 1960}. Although a solution of stannous chloride is commonly used as the reductant, its use does have several limita\u00ad tions and disadvantages, not the least of which are the instability of the reagent, the slow rate of color devel\u00ad opment, and the instability of the resulting color complex. Ascorbic acid has been proposed as a preferred re\u00ad ducing agent (Harvey, 1948; Murphy and Riley, 1958}. Even though its use provides several advantages, it has not been widely adopted, primaijly because of the very slow rate of reduction and color development. More recently, Murphy and Riley (1962) described an improved procedure based on their observation that the presence of added antimony results in rapid reduction of phosphomolybdic acid. Their procedure is extreme\u00ad ly simple, involving only the addition of a measured amount of a single-solution reagent to an aliquot of the test sample and, after 10 minutes, determining the ab\u00ad sorbance of the intense blue-purple complex at 882 mp.. The reagent is prepared by dissolving appropriate amounts of ammonium molybdate, ascorbic acid, and potassium antimonyl tartrate in dilute sulfuric acid . This reagent solution is unstable and must be used with\u00ad in 24 hours. The Murphy and Riley procedure offers several dis\u00ad tinct advantages over methods using stannous chloride as the reductant. The authors of this paper felt that the inconvenience of preparing the reagent solution for each analysis could be overcome by a simple modi\u00ad fication of the procedure. Moreover, the method ap\u00ad peared to be sufficiently simple and sensitive to be useful as a field method, when only a minimum amount of equipment is available. Thus, this paper describes a simplification of the Murphy and Riley procedure, and adapts their procedure to the field determination of phosphate in natural water samples, through the prep\u00ad aration of a set of permanent color standards against which test sa.mples may be compared. To avoid the inconvenience of \u00b7preparing the single\u00ad solution reagent fresh for each set of analyses, the dry reagents, ammonium molybdate, ascorbic acid, and po\u00ad tassium antimonyl tartrate, are mixed in the propor\u00ad tions recommended by Murphy and Riley (1962). When an analysis or a series of analyses is to be made, an appropriate amount of the mixture of the dry re\u00ad agents is dissolved in the required volume of dilute sul\u00ad furic acid. In actual practice, and for convenience in the field, dilute sulfuric acid is prepared in advance and stored in 1.00-ml bottles. The exact weight of the dry reagent mixture to be added to the dilute acid is not critical. It has been found that a small scoop which will repeatedly deliver between 0.8 and 1.2 g of the powder is satisfactory for preparation of the reagent solution. The concentration of phosphate ion in solu\u00ad tion can be determined by using a spectrophotometer or, alternatively, by using (1) a colorimeter, or (2} visual color standards. U.S. GEOL.

This reagent is stable for 3 to 4 months. Sulfuric acid, 2.5N: Add slowly, with constant stirring, 70 ml cone H2S04 to about 800 ml demineralized water and dilute to 1 liter. Phosphate reagent, solution : Dissolve 1\u00b10.2 g phosphate reagent powder in 100 ml 2.5N H2S04. The initial color will be blue. Allow to stand for about 15 minutes before using (pale yellow\u00ad green color). Prepare fresh daily. Color standards : The preparation of permanent color standards is a trial-and-error procedure. \"Castolite\" transparent dyes of blue, green, and violet (The Castolite Company, Woodstock, Ill.), in proper proportions, are satisfactory for preparing an alcoholic mixture of concentrated dye of the proper shade. Permanent color standards to match the color of each phos\u00ad phate standard ( 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 ppm P04) are conveniently prepared from the concentrated dye by dilution with ethyl alcohol in 1-oz (French square) bottles. Samples containing phosphate are then matched with the permanent color standards against a white background. Visual match\u00ad ing permits phosphate to be determined with an accuracy of \u00b10.1 ppm. DISCUSSION AND RESU'L TS Quantitative preparation of the single-solution re\u00ad agent from the powder is not necessary. Identical results are obtained using from 0.75 to 2.0 g of mixed powder to approximately 100 ml2.5N H2S04. It is not necessary to prepare a calibration curve each time phosphate is determined since the calibra.tion curves are reproducible from day to day. The calibration curves obtained at 882 mp. are almost identical to the ones reported by Murphy and Riley (1962). The accuracy of the method has been checked by ana\u00ad lyzing 12 natural water samples containing 0.02 to 1.0 ppm P04 and comparing the results using the method of Rain water and Thatcher ( 1960). The results agreed to \u00b10.01 ppm (see accompanying table). Replicate determinations are reproducible to +0.01 ppm. The method is subject to the same interferences as reported by Rainwater and Thatcher (1960).

GEOLOGICAL SURVEY RESEARCH 1965 LEACHABLE SILICA AND ALUMINA IN STREAMBED CLAYS By EDWARD C. MALLORY, JR., Denver, Colo. Abstract.-Partial dissolution of samples by boiling for 2.5 minutes in 0.5N NaOH gave approximate upper limits of leach\u00ad able silica and alumina in 19 concentrates of streambed clays. Silica ranged from 0.8 to 19.2 and alumina from 0.5 to 5.9 weight percent of air-dried clays. These ranges seem to be caused primarily by climate and geology. .Amorphous materials commonly occur in rocks and soils (Patterson, 1962, p. 42; .Aomine and Jackson, 1959, p. 210; Bates, 1960, p. 5 ; and Fieldes and others, 1952, p. 204-205) , yet the literature contains little informa\u00ad tion on the content and geographic distribution of these materials in clay fractions of streambed sediments. This paper presents information helpful in placing a p\u00ad proximate upper limits upon the variation of amorphous Si02 and amorphous .Al20 3 The data were obtained in the course of a study of the mineralogy and exchange capacity of streambed sediments made under the super\u00ad vision of V. G. Kennedy during 1961-63. This study of the leachable components of streambed sediments involved 56 samples of sediment collected at 20 sites on 19 different streams ranging from the Juniata River at Newport, Pa., to the 'Mad River at .Arcata, Calif. Figure 1 shows the locations and the drainage basins of these sites. Kennedy ( 1964) has described the clay mineralogy of streambed samples from the same sites. From studies of differential dissolution in N aOH solution as a means of purifying clay, Hashimoto and Jackson (1960, p. 102-113) learned that by boiling the clay preparation in 0.5N N aOH solution for as little as 2.5 minutes, allophane and free alumina and silica could be dissolved and separated from the clay, pro\u00ad vided the ratio of clay weight to solution volume was kept less than 100 milligrams to 100 milliliters. Some of their data are given in table 1. The data suggest that either the two sa.mples (kao\u00ad linite and montmorillonite) contained soluble amorph\u00ad their constituents were selec\u00ad tively leached in the 0.5N N aOH solution.

Then the clay (less than 0.004 mm) and silt ( 0.004-0.062 mm) were sep\u00ad arated by centrifugation and decantation. The differential dissolution method of Hashimoto and Jackson (1960, p. 102-104) was used to separate the leachable silica and alumina materials from the clay fraction. By this method, 50.,mg samples of air-dried clay were boiled for 2.5 minutes in 50 ml of 0.5N N aOH solution, and any soluble allophane and free alumina and silica present were separated from the nearly in\u00ad soluble clay (table 2) . .Amounts of leachable silica TABLE 2.-Results of repeat analyses of leachable silica and alumina in a single sample 1 Analysis ______________________ _ 2 _____________________ silica (percentage clay fraction) 2.3 2.3 2.3 2.3 2.3 Leachable alumina (percentage of clay fraction) 1.2 1.3 1.1 1.1 1.2 1 Each repeat analysis was made on a different day.

B172 QUALITY OF WATER and alumina dissolved were than determined by the analytical method of Shapiro and Brannock (1956, p. 31-35). To -avoid formation of an interfering precipi\u00ad tate at this stage of the determination, a 5-ml maximum aliquot of solution was used. The precision of the method is good (see table 2) . Because gibbsite, small amounts of poorly crystalline material, and very fine grained clays are soluble in boil\u00ad ing 0.5N N aOH, leachable material reported in table 3 represents an upper limit of the truly amorphous ma\u00ad terial. All 56 samples studied were examined by X-ray diffraction, and only those from the Y adkin River, in North Carolina, contained gibbsite in detectable amounts. The leachable silica content for all 56 samples aver\u00ad ages 3.9 percent and ranges from 0.8 to 19.2 percent; the leachable alumina content averages 1.5 percent and ranges from 0.5 to 5.9 percent. The combined content of the two constituents averages 5.5 percent of sample composition and ranges from 1.9 to 20.6 percent. If the samples of streambed clay from the Crooked River, in Oregon, (No. 20 on fig. 1), which are unusually high in amorphous silica, are omitted from consideration, the data in table 3 can be summarized as follows : leachable silica content of the clay fraction averages 3.2 percent; leachable alumina content averages 1.6 of leachable silica and alumina averages 4.8 percent and ranges from 1.9 to 10.7 percent. A general relation was noted between the amount of leachable material in streambed clays and Keller's ratios of rainfall to potential evaporation. Keller ( 19\u00b755, p. 67-72) showed that the intensity of weathering depends upon both precipitation and rate of evaporation of moisture; where the ratio of rainfall to evaporation is high, the degree of weathering also tends to be high. Generally, the highest content of leachable silica and alumina in streambed clays was found in streams east of long 81\u00b0 W. (sites 1, 2, and 3), where the ratio of rainfall to evaporation ranges from 1.0 to 1.3 (Keller, 1955). The next highest percentages were found in stream\u00ad bed clays between long 81\u00b0 and 102\u00b0 W. (sites 4-9), where the ratio of rainfall to evaporation ranges from 0.6 to 1.0. The lowest percentages were found between long 102\u00b0 and 111\u00b0 W. (sites 10-16) with ratios less than 0.6. Bed clays of streams west of long 119\u00b0 W.

MALLORY B173 range from less than average to above average in amount of leachable silica and alumina. Soil studies reported in the literature\u00b7 also suggest a correlation between climate and amorphous materiaL Aomine and Jackson (1959) reported that soils devel\u00ad oped on volcanic ash in Japan contained allophane. In a study of Hawaiian soils, Tamura and others ( 1953) found that soils in areas of highest rainfall contained considerable amounts of allophane. The Hawaiian soils were formed by the weathering of basalt and vol\u00ad canic ash. Patterson ( 1962, p. 64). suggests the possi\u00ad bility of abundant amorphous material on the island of Maui in the Hawaiian Islands. Fieldes and others ( 1952, p. 205) found amorphous materials in several soils of the Cook Islands in the South Pacific.. Studies by Whittig and others ( 1957, p. 226) indicate that soils of northwestern Oregon contain allophane. All the regions cited have a moist climate with moderate or warm temperatures. Of the samples analyzed, strea.mbed clays in Brandy\u00ad wine Creek and in the Juniata, Y adkin, Cosumnes, and Crooked Rivers (sites 1, 2, 3, 17, and 20 in table 3) contained the highest percentages of leachable silica and alumina. The first three of these rivers are in an area where the preeipitation-evaporation ratio is at least 1.1, so a moderate to high degree of weathering is to be expected. The Yadkin River clay, in North Carolina, had the highest percentage of leachable alumina. This river is in a warm humid area where gibbsite has been re\u00ad ported in soils (Alexander and others, 1941). The greatest percentages of leachable silica were found in samples from the Crooked River, in Oregon, an area where intense chemical weathering would not be expected. In the part of the drainage basin above the sampling site, precipitation is approximately 10 inches a year, and the mean annual temperature is about 47\u00b0F (U.S. Weather Bureau, 1956, p. 37, 52). Streambed clays in this area, however, contain more than 17 percent of leachable material, most of it silica. More intensive weathering may have occurred in this area at a previous time. Russell (1905, p. 34) states that \"over nearly all of central Oregon, there is abund\u00ad ant evidence of greater precipitation and more active erosion immediately preceding the present period of aridity and weak streams.\" The rocks of the area may also account for the high content of leachable silica found in samples from the Crooked River. Large deposits of volcanic tuff occur in this drainage basin (Russell, 1905) and may weather so as to form greater amounts of amorphous silica. Russell ( 1905, p. 19) also mentions the presence of opal grains at Opal Spring, located on the Crooked River below the collection point. He believes that the opal is derived from the basaltic rock through which the springwater passes. The Cosumnes River of California. carries clay con\u00ad taining above-average amounts of leachable silica, de\u00ad spite the fact that it drains an area where intense chem\u00ad ical weathering would not be expected. The average annual precipitation of the lower part of the river basin ranges from 15 to 30 inches; that in the upper part of the basin ranges from 30 to 60 inches (Baker, 1936, p. 6). The area of greatest precipitation is at high altitude along the west slope of the SierraN evada, so lower tem\u00ad peratures would tend to decrease the degree of chemical weathering. However, in the lower part of its basin, the Cosumnes River drains an extensive area underlain by the lone formation of Eocene age. The lone consists of gravel, sand, clay, and lignite; the lower lone is char\u00ad acterized by minerals that persist through intense weathering (Pask and Turner, 1952, p. 16-20). Allen ( 1929, p.. 393, 403) concluded that a tropical or sub\u00ad tropical climate existed during Eocene time in Cali\u00ad fornia. Thus, although present-day conditions do not result in intense chemical weathering, above-average amounts of amorphous silica in the sediments of the Cosumnes may be accounted for by a previous cycle of intense weathering. The data of this study suggest the following con\u00ad clusions: 1. The amount of leachable silica and alumina in streambed clays is directly relruted to the degree of weathering induced by the climate. A warm moist cli\u00ad Inate hastens the process of chemical weathering and favors the formation of amorphous material and (or) gibbsite. 2. Source rocks may contribute anomalous amounts of leachable material in a region that does not presently have intense chemical weathering. Such rocks may have been weathered during a previous cycle when the climate was warrn and moist. REFERENCES Alexander, L. T., Hendricks, S. B., and Faust, G.

GEOLOGICAL SURVEY RESEARCH 1965 GROWTH OF SALT CEDAR (T AMARI X GALLICAJ IN THE PECOS RIVER NEAR THE NEW MEXICO- TEXAS BOUNDARY By R. U. GROZIER, San Angelo, Tex. Abstract. -Increase in the area covered by the phreatophyte salt cedar ( Tamarirr gallica) in and along the Pecos River near the New Mexieo--Texas boundary has been recorded by a series of photographs taken since 1916. Examples of the physical effects of this growth inelude a 35-percent reduction in channel conveyance, observed in the reeords of floods in August 1916 and June 1937, and a 15-percent reduction in eross section of channel from December 1932 to March 1963. A series of photographs taken since 1916 provides striking evidence of channel changes in the Pecos River near the boundary between New Mexico and Texas. These changes have resulted from an increasing growth of salt cedar ( Tamarim gallioa) and from the deposition of silt in the channel and along the banks. Reduction in stream velocity due to ponding caused by the presence of vegetation in river bottoms is well known (Robinson, 1958, p. 28) as a cause of sedimentation in many streams in the Southwestern United States. Backwater from Red Bluff Reservoir extended into this reach of the river during several periods (June 1937 to June 1938, May 1941 to July 1943, and December 1943 to April 1944), and some siltation of the river channel probably occurred during these periods. However, conspicuous sedimentation of the river channel had been observed before completion of the reservoir early in 1937. A stream-gaging station was maintained on the Pecos River near Angeles, Tex., from May 1914 to September 1937. A photograph taken in 1916 (fig. 1A), looking downstream from the gaging station, shows a wide chan\u00ad nel with little vegetation. Under these conditions the flood of August 8, 1916, reached a peak discharge of 60,000 cubic feet per second at a stage of 22.5 feet. A second photograph (fig.1B) shows that by Novem\u00ad ber 1936, before completion of the reservoir, the en\u00ad croachment of salt cedar had reduced the channel ap\u00ad preciably. During the flood of June 1, 1937, the peak discharge, 38,900 cfs, required nearly the same stage (22.3 feet) as the flood in 1916, although the discharge A FIGURE I.-Progressive growth of salt cedar in Pecos River channel downstream from a discontinued stream-gaging sta\u00ad tion, 8-4095 Pecos River near Angeles, Tex.

This same period is reported 1 to have been that in which the maximum rate of infestation by salt cedar occurred on the Pecos River. A third photograph (fig. 10), taken in October 1961, shows that growth of the salt cedar has continued to narrow the channel. Further evidence. of channel aggradation is shown by two channel cross sections (fig. 2) . In 30 years the cross\u00ad sectional area at an 18-foot stage has been reduced from 6,360 to 5,380 square feet, or 15 percent. The propor\u00ad tional reduction of channel conveyance must have been even larger than this change suggests, because of plant growth on much of the new fill. During nonfl.ood periods the water level is at about 3 to 4 feet at the location of the cross sections. Heavy salt cedar growth covers both banks above this stage. Photographs will be made at 5-year intervals to record channel changes. 1 Salt Cedar Task Force for New Mexico, 1951, Report to the Salt Cedar Interagency Council: Report prepared for Salt Cedar Interagency Council (C.

GEOLOGICAL Sti\u00b7RVEY RESEARCH 1965 EFFECT OF GREAT SWAMP, NEW JERSEY, ON STREAMFLOW DURING BASE-FLOW PERIODS By E. G. MILLER, Trenton, N.j. Work done in cooperation with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the New Jersey Department of Conservation and Economic Development .A.bstract.-During periods of high evapotranspiration the sur\u00ad face drainage out of Great Swamp, N.J., is considerably less than the inflow to the swamp. Evapotranspiration from Great Swamp is believed to cause a significant reduction in yield during periods of base flow in most of the period of June through September. Great Swamp, in the headwater part of the Passaic River basin in northern New Jersey, is one of numerous tracts of swampland which together are important in the hydrology of the basin ( V ecchioli and others, 1962) . Great Swamp consists of about 10 square miles of wet\u00ad lands, but because of the need for ease of access to sites suitable for stream -discharge measurements the area herein termed Great Swamp is defined arbitrarily, for the purpose of this paper, as the 19 square miles within circumferential roads which encircle the swamp and some adjoining territory (fig. 1). Vecchioli and others (1962) describe geologic and hydrologic conditions in the swamp. The regional ground-water body underlying Great Swamp is con\u00ad fined by relatively impermeable clay and silt beds which average about 60 feet in thickness. The artesian head in the aquifer is higher than the swamp level, indicating that the swamp is in an area of ground-water discharge. However, the quantity of water leaking upward into the swamp is estimated, on the basis of reasonable assump\u00ad tions, to be only a'bout 45,000 gallons per day (less than 0.1 cubic foot per second) in 10 square miles. Water in Great Swamp is at or near the land surface through\u00ad out most of the year, and the water table is relatively flat. Because of the slight hydraulic gradient and the low permeability of the shallow materials, lateral move\u00ad ment of ground water beneath the swamp is slow. V ecchioli and others ( 1962, p. 699-700) conclude that during the nongrowing season the storage capacity of the shallow zone of saturation is exceeded and a con\u00ad siderable amount of water is ponded. At such times nearly all the precipitation that falls runs off. During the growing season, the surface of the swamp becomes dry except for the stream channels, and the water table falls to its lowest stage. Then, they postulate, much of the precipitation which falls on the swamp and some of the water stored in the swamp are dissipated by evapotranspiration. This investigation was made, as a test of the hypothe\u00ad sis outlined above, by determining the effect of Great Swamp on the streamflow of the Passaic River near Millington, N.J., during periods of base flow (sustained or fair-weather flow) in the ice-free months when nor\u00ad mal streamflow is comparatively low. Surface inflow to the swamp was measured at 36 sites near the circumfer\u00ad ential roads on 7 different days when base flow prevailed. Measurements on Nov. 9, 1961, Apr. 20, 1962, and June 11,1962, were made from 3 to 5 days after the preceding significant rainfall, and all the other measurements were made at least 12 days after. Surface outflow from the swamp was measured at the stream-gaging station on the Passaic River near Millington, N.J., \u00b7above which the area of the basin is 55.4 square miles. For each of the 7 days the total inflow was subtracted from the total discharge from the basin at the gaging station; the dif\u00ad ference represents the effect of the swamp on the flow of the river. A summary of the measurements\u00b7, presented in the accompanying table, compares inflow and outflow and gives the difference as the swamp contribution. On days when the outflow from the swamp was less than the inflow to the swamp, the swamp contribution is ex\u00ad pressed as a negative value. The yield per square mile of Great Swamp is computed from the observed figures of inflow and outflow. To make the yield figures for U.S. GEOL. SURVEY PROF.

The mag\u00ad nitude of the diversion, about 1.5 cfs, is the differenee between columns 1 and 2 of the table. The comparison of the yield per square mile of Great Swamp with the yield per square mile of the upstream area tributary to the swamp is shown as a ratio in col\u00ad umn 9 of the table. These values show not only that the contribution of the swa.mp area to streamflow is variable, but that at times less water flows out of the swamp than had flowed into it. The values for the ratio of the swamp contribution to the inflow from the up\u00ad stream drainage area, per square mile, range from a high of 1.19 in an April observation to a. low of -1.05 in a July observation. All the examples of diminution of streamflow through Great Swamp occurred during the period J nne-Septem\u00ad ber, and it is reasonable to conclude that the high evap\u00ad otranspiration during that season caused the reduction in base flow. Vecchioli and others (1962, p. 698) indi\u00ad cate that the net ground-water movement in the area. is into the swamp. There is no significant use of water in the swamp area by man. The only remaining possible causes of water loss from the swamp, other than surface flow, are evaporation and transpiration. The nature of the swamp favors evapotranspiration. Water entering Great Swamp comes from rolling hills in well-defined channels, but in the swamp the water flows very slowly in response to low hydraulic gradients, and follows meandering courses. Near the outlet of the swamp the water is virtually ponded in channels many times the size of the tributary streams, increasing the opportunity for evaporation. Moreover, Great Swamp supports a lush growth of aquatic plants and trees which must utilize large quantities of water. Finally, evaporation\u00ad pan data from Canoe Brook, N.J., about 10 miles north\u00ad east of Millington, indicate evaporation rates (for ex\u00ad ample, 0.06 to 0.28 inch per day during the period July 14-17, 1962) which, if assumed to be representative of the rates at Great Swamp, can account for the observed losses. The measurements made in October, November, and April suggest that during the periods characterized by low evapotranspiration and by base flow, the swamp contribution per square mile may equal or even exceed the yield per square mile of the upstream region. This condition is a logical consequence of the fact that the swamp is an area of discharge for the regional ground\u00ad water body, whereas at least portions of the upstream part of the basin are are,as of recharge. Thus, during periods when evapotranspiration may be neglected and when the surface-storage space in the swamp is full, the yield of Great Swamp is the precipitation plus the ground-water discharge, whereas the yield of the up\u00ad stream region is the precipitation less the ground-water recharge.

F. POLAND and R. L. IRELAND, Sacramento, Calif. Abstract.-Compaction of sediments and shortening and pro\u00ad trusion of a heavy oil-test casing have been measured since 1962 at Westhaven in western Fresno County. Results indicate that in subsiding areas, tops of well casings are not stable bench marks, and that increased protrusion of casings is not a measure of land subsidence. The Los Banos-Kettleman City area in the San J oa\u00ad quin Valley, central California, is the most rapidly sub\u00ad siding area in the United States at the present time ( 1964). Maximum subsidence to 1963 has been 23 foot, and the present maximum rate is 1.4 feet per year. The subsidence, which occurs over about 1,200 Equare miles, mostly in western Fresno County, is due chiefly to decline of artesian head and the resulting compaction of the sediments in a confined aquifer system. In connection with its studies of land subsidence and the mechanics of aquifer systems in changing hydrologic environments, the U.S. Geological Survey in 1958 was afforded the opportunity of converting an abandoned oil-test hole into a dual water-level dbservation well in order to determine the a.rtesian- head relations nea.r the top and the base of the confined aquifer system. The well is at Westhaven, in the southern part of the Los Banos-Kettleman City area. In addition to furnishing critical information on the artesian head, the installa\u00ad tion has also furnished data on compaction of the sedi\u00ad ments and the vertical compression (shortening) of the oil-well casing in response to the eompac.tion. This paper describes shortening of the easing and the impli\u00ad cations of the shortening. Short.ening of well casings is eommon in areas sub\u00ad siding because of fluid-pressure reduetion and compac\u00ad tion of sediments. For example, in the Los Banos\u00ad Kettleman City area many hundreds of water wells have failed because of easing rupture due to vertical compression. Many casing breaks are repaired each year after photographs have been taken in the well cas-ing to show the depth and nature of the breaks. Also, at the Wilmington oil field in Los Angeles County, Calif., where maximum subsidence of 27 feet had oc\u00ad curred by 1962, shortening of many oil-well casings as a result of compaction of the oil-producing zones has been measured by local operators. Casing-collar logs have been run periodically to determine changes in cas\u00ad ing-joint lengths since the wells were first completed. Casing shortening of as much as 17 feet in a single well has been measured. Thus, the casing shortening re\u00ad ported in this paper is not unique. However, the scope of quantitative information on the rate and amount of casing shortening, casing protrusion, and compaction of the sediments, in relation to approximate land sub\u00ad sidence, is unique and provides evidence for certain spe\u00ad cific conclusions. The writers wish to acknowledge the cooperation of the Texas Co., of the California Division of Oil and Gas, and of Mr. D. A. Patterson, Manager of the Boston Ranch Co., in making this oil-test hole available for conversion to an observation well. INSTALLATION AND MEASUREMENTS When the oil-test hole was drilled by the Texas Co. in 1957, a surface string of 1V~i -inch casing weighing 54 pounds per foot and having a wall thickness of about 0.44 inch was installed from land surface to a depth of 2,004 feet. Cement was pumped into the annular space around the casing from the bottom shoo to land surface, providing a continuous seal to prevent contamination of the fresh ground water. On abandonment of the oil test, the operator placed a cement plug beneath and in the lower part of the 11%, -inch casing, extending up to a depth of 1,930 feet. The U.S. Geological Survey converted the blank cas\u00ad ing to a dual water-level observation well in April1958. As is shown on figure 1, the 11%,-inch casing was gun- U.S. GEOL. SURVEY PROF.

Four-inch standard screw pipe having a snug-fitting steel and composition packer flange at its base was then run into the 11%,-inch casing to a depth of 860 feet. The 4-inch pipe was suspended by a casing hanger resting on the top of the 11%, -inch pipe. A cement plug then was placed between the 4-inch and 11%,-inch casings in the depth interval between 840 and 860 feet to produce hy\u00ad draulic separation of the two perforated intervals, both of which then were developed by means of air lift. Soon after the 4-inch casing was installed, the junior author noticed that its hanger appeared to be rising off the top of the 11%, -inch casing, indicating shortening of the 11%-inch casing between land surface and the 850-foot depth where the two casings are bonded by the cement seal. The progressive separation was measured monthly, and by August 1962, 414 years after the 4-inch casing was installed, it totalled 1.35 feet. At that time a device for measuring compaction was installed as fol\u00ad lows: An anchor weight was lowered inside the 4-inch casing until it came to rest on the cement plug at 1,930 feet; the cable used for lowering the weight was passed over two pulleys supported on a steel rack at the land surface, and a counterweight was attached to the end of the cable (fig. 1). This installation is similar to the compaction-measuring equipment described by Lofgren (1961, p. 49), except that land-surface movement rela\u00ad tive to the reference clamp on the cable is measured at monthly intervals instead of continuously. It provides a measure of the total compaction or shortening of the interval between the cement plug at 1,930 feet and the land surface. \u00b7Also, beginning in February 1963, pro\u00ad trusion of the top of the 11%-inch casing above the land surface was measured. Increased protrusion represents the part of the compaction that did not result in shorten\u00ad ing of the casing. Figure 2 illustrates the upper part of the compaction-measuring device, and the vertical separation between the two casings. RESULTS The measurements of progressive separation of the tops of the casings, of the shortening of the distance be\u00ad tween the land surface and the cement plug at 1,930 feet, and of the increased protrusion of the 11.:3,4-inch casing furnished the evidence for plotting the total \u00b7 shortening of the 11%,-inch casing to 1,930 feet and the shortening occurring above and below the 850-foot ce\u00ad ment plug, as shown on figure 3. From August 1962 to April 1964, the shortening of the distance between the land surface and the cement plug at 1,930 feet was 1.09 feet. The total shortening of the 11%,-inch casing and its cement jacket from the top to a depth of 1,930 feet was 1.04 feet ( 1.09 feet minus the casing protrusion of about 0.05 foot). The casing shortening from the top to a depth of 850 feet was 0.49 foot (measured casing separation). The shortening be\u00ad tween depths of 850 and 1,930 feet was 0.55 foot (1.04 feet minus0.49 foot) (fig. 3). If it is assumed that the cement plug at 1,930 feet maintained a constant position with respect to the con\u00ad tiguous sediments. which seems reasonable in view of their structural bonding below the bottom of the 11%\u00ad inch casing, the 1.09 feet of shortening between the land surface and the cement plug represents measured com\u00ad paction of the sediments to a depth of 1,930 feet. Thus, during the 21-month period, the 11%, -inch casing and its cement jacket were shortened 1.04 feet in response to 1.09 feet of compaction of the surrounding sediments\u00ad tha:t is, the casing shortening was equal to 95 percent of the compaction. In the same time period, land subsidence, extrapolated from relevelings of nearby bench marks by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey in December 1959 and March 1963, was 1.2 feet. If this extrapolated figure is correct, about 0.1 foot of compaction occurred below a depth of 1,930 feet.

However, these extrapolated values for land subsidence do not affect the figures for casing shorten\u00ad ing, which are a.bsolute values. CONCLUSIONS The observations at this site indicate that even heavy oil-well casing encas~ in a cement jacket is too weak to resist the compressional force of the compacting sedi\u00ad ments and is being shortened virtually in accord with the compaction. Therefore, it is concluded that in an area subsiding because of sediment compaction due to decrease in fluid pressure, the top of a well casing is not a stable reference bench mark even though the casing may extend beneath the compacting sediments. FIGURE 3.-Shortening and protrusion of 113,4 -inch casing at Westhaven, Calif. Each dot on the plots represents an exact measurement. No dots are shown on the lower two plots from August 1962 to February 1963 because exact readings are not available for intermediate control. Increased protrusion of a casing above the land sur\u00ad face in such a subsiding area should not be considered a reliable measure of compaction or of land subsidence. The increased protrusion of the casing at Westhaven is only about 5 percent of the compaction. On the other hand, in at least one subsiding area, Mexico City, the observed protrusion of some well casings has been ap\u00ad proximately equal to compaction and subsidence. Here, POLAND AND IRELAND Bl83 well casings have protruded as much as 18 feet in re\u00ad sponse to subsidence of about the same magnitude (R. J. Marsal, written communication, August 1956), showing that under favorable physical conditions, the skin fric\u00ad tion between the compacting sediments and the well casing may not be sufficient to overcome the compressive strength of the easing. Thus, although the increased protrusion of a well casing above the land surface is evidence both for compaction of deposits within the well depth and for land subsidence, the ma.gnitude of the protrusion affords only a minimum value that may range from only a few percent to approximately 100 percent of the subsidence. Some of the factors influencing the response of a well casing to compacting forces in such a subsiding area are: 1. The casing depth compared to the depth range of the compacting zone. 2. The strength of the casing to resist vertical com\u00ad pression. 3. The magnitude of the skin friction between the com\u00ad pacting sediments and the well casing, which is determined in part by the type of well construction, the depth of the compacting zone, and the lithology of the compacting sediments. The last two factors are of 1najor influence in determin\u00ad ing the relation of shortening to protrusion. REFERENCE Lofgren, B.

GEOLOGICAL SURVEY \u00b7RESEARCH 1965 USE OF SODIUM IODIDE TO TRACE UNDERGROUND WATER CIRCULATION IN THE HOT SPRINGS AND GEYSERS OF THE DAISY GEYSER GROUP, YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK By j. j. ROWE, R. 0. FOURNIER, and G. W. MOREY, Washington, D.C. Abstract.-Sodium iodide was found to be a suitable tracer in studies of water circulation in underground hot springs and geyser conduits. Subterranean interconnections linking certain hot springs and geysers were proved, and an underground reser\u00ad voir containing at least 70,000 gallons of water is calculated to be present beneath the geyser group investigated. Water prob\u00ad ably flows into and out of this reservoir at a rate of about 90 gallons per minute. Most of the discharge from the reservoir occurs below the surface, with only 10 to 15 gpm observed at the surface. The interrelation of associated geysers pools and hot . ' ' springs in Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., was in- vestigated as a part of the study of the geochemistry of thermal waters in the park. lT nderground connections have been inferred in the past from observations of the reciprocal behavior of geysers, pools, and hot springs (Marler, 1951). Chemical tracers provide a means for proving the existence of underground connections and for determining the approximate volume of water in\u00ad volved in a particular system. Ideally, a tracer suitable for studies of water move\u00ad ment in subterranean hot-spring conduits should fulfill the following requirements : ( 1) Minute quantities of the tra.cer shoul~ be detectable, preferably, by sim\u00ad ~le, quick \u00b7analytieal procedures capable of being used In the field. ( 2) The natural water being studied should initially not contain the tracer in quantities large enough to mask small additions from a source outside the sys\u00ad tem. (3) Once introduced, the tracer should not be re\u00ad m?ved ~rom ~he wa~er by adsorption or ion exchange witl~ s?hd.s with which it may come into contact, or by pre:-Ipitatwn due to chemical processes, or by decom\u00ad position. ( 4) The tracer should he cheap, easily obtain\u00ad abl~, and should present no health hazard to any form of hfe. ~ 5) The tracer should go into solution rapidly. Organic dyes such as fluorescein and rhodamine B have been used in qualitative and quantitative studies of water movement (Japanese Government Agencies, 1958; Moon and others, 1957; Carpenter, 1960). How\u00ad ever, the dyes tend to be markedly adsorped by clays and silica (Eugene S. Simpson, written communication, April21, 1960), or they may decompose after being ex\u00ad posed for moderate lengths of time to high temperature underground. Many stable isotopes make excellent tracers in natural waters, but they are generally expensive and require a Inass spectrometer for analysis. Radioactive isotopes offer ease of recognition and analysis in the field. How\u00ad ever, they, too, are expensive, and they constitute a po\u00ad tential health hazard. It seemed likely that iodide as sodium iodide might be an effective tracer in the hot-spring waters of Yellow\u00ad stone, for the following reasons: (1) Iodide is initially absent or present in only trace amounts in the waters. (2) As little as 0.1 part per million of iodide may be detected by analytical procedures which can be used in the field. (3) Because the waters contain a high con\u00ad tent of chloride ( 303 ppm) and sodium ( 404 ppm), we can assume that iodide will not be removed by adsorp\u00ad tion or ion exchange. ( 4) Sodium iodide is relatively inexpensive and presents no health hazards. ( 5) So\u00ad dium iodide is very soluble in water. A test of the applicability of iodide as a tracer in hot\u00ad spring conduits was made in Yellowstone National Park at the Daisy group of geysers and hot springs during a period when none of the large geysers was active. The Daisy group consists of Comet, Splendid, and Daisy Geysers, Bonita and Brilliant Pools, a small unnamed geyser 40 feet south of Splendid, and two small pools near Splendid. These units are closely spaced within an area of 40 by 150 feet (fig. 1). The water in all the pools is boiling (about 92\u00b0C). Interconnections between most of these springs and geysers had previously been inferred by Marler (1951), who noted reciprocal be\u00ad havior, as for example, simultaneous rise and fall of water levels and sympathetic geyser eruptions among members of the group. Seven pounds of Nai was added to Splendid Geyser, and the iodide content of water in this geyser and adj a- U.S. GEOL. SURVEY PROF.

A colorimetric method of analysis was used, utilizing a Lumetron photoelectric colorimeter, modified to operate in the field on a 12-volt automobile battery. Iodide was oxi\u00ad dized to water, I-1+3Br~+3H20~IOa -1+6HBr, after which excess bromine was either boiled out or neutralized with phenol. The iodate formed was then reacted with KI to produce six \u00b7atoms of iodine for each atom of iodide originally present : 108 -1+5I-1+6H+1~3I~+3HJO. The iodine thus formed was measured by using either the blue color developed with starch (Rainwater and Thatcher, 1960, p. 181) or the violet color developed by extracting the iodine into carbon tetrachloride ( Ovenston and Reece, 1951). The starch method was found fo be more sensitive to small tra.ces of iodide, but the color developed in the carbon tetrachloride was more stable than the color developed with starch. The carbon tetrachloride method is considered preferable for use in the field. These methods of analysis, though ade\u00ad quate, are not as simple nor as rapid as one would desire. The iodide content of Bonita Pool before the addition of N al to the system was 4 parts per billion, determined by Dr. W. B. Lyon, of the Oak Ridge National Labora\u00ad tory, using the neutron-activation method. Such a sm.all concentration of iodide could not be detected in the field.

All the geysers in the Daisy group had been dormant for several months priortothetimeofthetracerstudy (Sept.14-15, 1963), and they continued dormant during the course of the work reported here. However, an estimated 10 to 15 gallons per minute of water was continuously dis\u00ad charged from Bonita Pool and also an estimated 4 to 8 gpm from a small geyser about 50 feet east of Bonita. The study showed that water in the surface pool at 'Splendid readily mixes with water underground and travels quickly to Bonita Pool, where some water is dis\u00ad charged from the system. The small geyser east of Bonita probably is not connected by shallow channels to the Daisy geyser group and may have no physical connection at all. The very small content of iodide ( 0.1 part per million) found in Daisy Geyser after about an hour indicates that, in the absence of an eruption, the water in the surficial pool of Daisy mixes slowly with water of Splendid's immediate system. On the other hand, 7.4 ppm iodide found in Comet Geyser after 50 minutes indicates that there is quick physical mixing with a relatively discrete body of water that also mixes readily with the water in the surficial pool of Splendid Geyser. The volume of underground pools and reservoirs can\u00ad not be calculated with certainty from the results of this study. We must assume for this purpose that iodide adsorption and (or) ion exchange with underground solids was slight. There is no certainty that the added N al ever became uniformly distributed in \u00b7all the locally available underground water. Also, from the moment that the iodide was placed in the pool of Splendid, part of that iodide began to be carried aW-ay by the water circulating underground. \u00b7 Other thermal water was continuously a.dded to the immediate reservoir from be\u00ad low to dilute the iodide locally. However, on the basis B186 EXPERIMENTAL AND THEORETICAL HYDROLOGY of the relatively constant 10\u00b1 1 ppm iodide found in the pool of Splendid during the interval from 1 hour 21 minutes to 2 hours 47 minutes after addition of the tracer it is probable that a relatively discrete body of ~ater o~ .a~out 71,000 gallons is situated underground In the vicinity of, and directly connected with, Splendid Geyser. This same pool is more remotely connected to other members of the Daisy Geyser group. It is known that the total amount of water ejected by Splendid Geyser during a single eruption lasting 10 minutes is approximately 30 to 40 thousand gallons (G. D. Marler, written eommunication, Oct. 31, 1962). Thus about half of the immediately a vailahle under\u00ad ground water may be ejeeted during an eruption of Splendid. Certainly all the water available to Splendid is not ejected during a major geyser eruption, because the water level in connecting pools such as Brilliant goes down, but the water is not completely drained. In spite of the limitations imposed by unknown fac\u00ad tors in the natural system and the dubiousness of certain assumptions, it is interesting and informative to write an equation of continuity for the eirculation and dilu\u00ad tion of the N ai placed in the water of the Daisy geyser group. In the. formulation of such an equation the following assumptions were 1nade: ( 1) A reservoir exists beneath Splendid Geyser containing 71,000 gallons (268 000 liters) of water. ( 2) The 7 pounds of N a I ( 3,175 gr~ms of N ai or 2,680 g of iodide) added to the water of the reservoir quickly dissolved, and thereafter the concen\u00ad tr~ti~:m of iodide rema,ined uniform owing to convective stirring. ( 3) The only point of discharge from the sys\u00ad tem of water containing iodide was Bonita Pool and an equal a.mou.nt of iodide-free water continuously'entered the reservoir from some underground source. The rate of flow of 10 gpm (37.85 1 per min) is used in the calculation. Let x be the number of grams of iodide in the reser\u00ad voir at the end of t minutes. The concentration C is ili@ ' ' X 0 268,000 g per I. In the time dt, 37.85 dt l of water came into the reser\u00ad voir and ~7.85 dt l of iodide solution was discharged from Bonita. Hence the change in the amount of iodide in the reservoir is dx=-37.85 Cdt -37.85 X 268,000 dt. The amount of iodide in the reservoir expected to be present after 29 hours (1,750 minutes) is then deter\u00ad mined by and rx dx J2,680 Jo dt, X ln 2 680=-0.247. ' Solving for x yields a value of 2,094 g of iodide in 268,000 I of water, or about 7.8 ppm. However, the measured concentration after 29 hours was 1 ppm. Even if the overflow of Bonita Pool was underesti\u00ad mated by two-thirds (overflow 30 gpm rather than 10), the expected concentration of iodide in the reservoir after 29 hours would be about 4.8 ppm. In order to decrease the iodide concentration to 1 ppm in 29 hours a rate of movement of water through the system of about 90 gpm would be needed. Admittedly, the above calculations are crude, and the assumptions upon which they are based are difficult to evaluate. The results are, however, compatible with the interpretation that most of the iodide has been lost from the system by underground circulation. Much of this iodide may have been discharged in the water flowing from pools and geysers outside the Daisy geyser group. On the basis of observations of apparent reciprocal be\u00ad havior of Giant and Splendid Geysers in 1952, when both of these geysers were active, George D. Marler (written eommunica.tion, Oct. 31, 1962) suggested that the Giant Geyser group (including Grotto Geyser) is connected to the Daisy geyser group. Thus, a good place to have looked for far-traveling iodide during the tracer study would have been Grotto Geyser, which is located about 1,100 feet N. 70\u00b0 E. of Splendid Geyser, and which erupted several times during the course of the study.

GEOLOGICAL SURVEY RESEARCH 1965 THE ALGEBRA OF STREAM-ORDER NUMBERS By ADRIAN E. SCHEIDEGGER, Urbana, Ill. A.bstract.-In studies of river morphology in which the con\u00ad cept of stream order is used, it is commonly assumed that where two rivers of order N join, they form a river of order N +1. No general rule is followed, however, for finding the order X of a stream formed by two rivers of different orders N and M. The order X can be computed according to the equation X =lou~ (2N+2M). In many studies of the morphology of river systems, streams a.re classified on the basis of order, proreeding downstream from the headwaters. For example, first\u00ad order streams are those which (on a map of given scale) have no tributaries, and second-order streams are those which reeeive as tributaries only streams of the first order. Horton (1945), who developed the coneept of stream order now widely used in the United States and .who based a theory of similarity of river systems on stream order, considered that the main stream should be denoted by the same ordinal number all the 'vay to its head waters, and henee he renun1bered one of the first\u00ad order streams (usually eit-her the longest or the one which seems the n1ost direct upstream eontinuation of the main stream) as second order. The proeedure was then repeated with higher-order streams, so that the Nth-order stream extends headward to the beginning A B of the longest tributary. Thus, as a stream-order map was prepared, Horton renumbered one of the lower\u00ad order streams every time two channels of equal order joined one another. Strahler ( 1957) applied the term \"order\" only to ehannel segments. He assumed that two channel segments of order N which join form a ehannel of order N + 1. Both Horton and Strahler ig\u00ad nored the junction of an Nth-order ehannel with lower\u00ad order ehannels in assigning order numbers. Figure 1 illustrates the applieation of these stream-ordering sys\u00ad tems to a hypothetical stream. Rzhanitsyn ( 1964) expanded Horton's similarity theory. He (1964, p. 3-5) stated that the eharacter\u00ad isties of eaeh river reach depend on its order (the order signifying a stream that has definite physical charae\u00ad teristics), and on its position along the length of the stream, and that similarity conditions can be expressed that are specific for each order. To determine design equations for channel works, the eharacteristics per\u00ad taining to the various orders must be related to each other. Rzhanitsyn ( 1964) followed a procedure similar to that of Horton and of Strahler, in assuming stream order to increase by 1 if a strean1 is joined by another c FIGURE 1.-St~eam-ordering systems of Horton (A.), Strahler (B), and this report (G), as applied to a hypothetical stream (m part after Bowden and 'Vallis, 196-!).

This assumption is meaningful in an idealized river system which is very regular, such as an idealized river network which consists only of the confluence of streams of the same order, combining to form a stream of the next higher order. However, real streams are more complex; many of them receive numer\u00ad ous tributaries of lower order. What, then, should be the order of a combined streain ~ As was noted above, the lower-order tributaries are ignored under the order\u00ad ing systems of Horton and of Strahler. R.zhanitsyn ( 1964, p. 26) stated that because \" ... the change of the characteristics of a stream of a given order to those of the next higher order increases the numerical values of the characteristics . . . there is good reason to con\u00ad sider that the river changes in order also in the case when, for instance, two rivers of the III order enter consecutively into a river of IV order, so that below the inflow of the second III order stream the river changes to a V order.\" The purpose of the present paper is to define a con\u00ad sistent algebra of stream-order numbers which will take into account the effect on the order of a stream of the inflow of lower-order tributaries. EXPLICIT LAW FOR THE COMPOSITION OF STREAM ORDERS The basic property of stream-order numbers is that result must be the same whether an M-order river joins an N-order one, or vice versa) it is postulated that N*M=M*N. The above postulates define completely the algebra of combination of stream-order numbers. Any integral N can be expressed in terms of smaller orders: N=(N-1) * (N-1)=(N-2) * (N-2) * (N-2) * (N-2) =M*M*M* ..... *M, where the number of \"factors\" M is equal to 2 N-M. Thus we may write N=M*'J!V-M where the asterisk in the \"exponent\" indicates that the \"multiplications\" (that is combinations denoted by *) refer to confluences of streams of the indicated order. Continuing the alg~braic analysis to include hypo\u00ad thetical zero-order streams (which do not exist in nature), N =0 *'J!V and Also, if two \"orders\" N be combined [operation denoted by Hence, setting an asterisk ( *) ] the resulting stream is of order N + 1. X=N*M Hence N*N=N+l. This relates algebraically the operation of combination and the operation of addition [denoted as usual by plus ( +)], with respect to channels of the same order. Other rules are needed for the combination of chan\u00ad nels of unequal orders. Rzhanitsyn's assumption that the confluence of two streams of order N -1 with an Nth order stream increases the order of the latter to N + 1 is shown below to lead to a consistent algebra of stream\u00ad order numbers. The effect of other streams of still lower order must also be taken into account. Therefore it is postulated that N* (N-1) * (N-1)=N+L Furthermore, in order that the distributive law be valid (that is, that the order in which the rivers join is imma\u00ad terial) , it is postulated that [N* * (N-1)]; and so that the commutative law be satisfied (since the we have, from a combination of the three previous equations: or This is the general law for the composition of strea.m\u00ad order numbers, derived from the :fundamental postu\u00ad lates for integer values of N and 11!; by analytic con\u00ad tinuation, it may be extended to noninteger values. One problem facing the geomorphologist who uses stream order in his studies lies in the identification of first-order strea.ms, which depends on the scale of the topographic map used. A stream classified :from map interpretation as being of the first order might be seen in the field to be a second-or third -order stream. The strean1-order composition law derived above does not depend significantly on the choice of stream to be desig\u00ad nated as being o:f the first order. If the second -order streams are treated as first-order streams, then all orders SCHEIDEGGER Bl89 are simply reduced by one: (M-1) * (N-1) log (2N-1+2M-l) log2 =(M*M-1. ANALYTICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE STREAM- ORDERING METHODS 1 As was noted above, the effect of lower-order tribu\u00ad t:uies on the order of larger streams is generally ne\u00ad glected, and the order of a stream is assumed to change only if the stream is joined by another of the same order (fig. lA, B). This procedure is expressed in the fol\u00ad lowing algebraic statements (in which confluence is de\u00ad noted an asterisk, as previously) : N*M=NifN>M =MifN<M;and =N+1 ifN=M. But these statements represent an algebra for which the distributive law does not hold. Thus, [ ( M -1) * ( M -1)] * M = M* M = M + 1 ( M -1) * [ ( M -1) * M] = ( M-1) * 111 = 111 In other words, two rivers of order (M-1) must first combine if their confluence with an M-order river is to increase the latter's order. Another feature of the generally accepted schemes is that \"factorization\" is not uniquely possible. A stream of a given order ( > 1) can in theory be created in an infinity of ways by combinations of lower-order streams. In nature the situation is much simpler because in most places only a relatively small number of lower-order tributaries flow into a stream of N-order before it joins another N-order stream. Nonetheless, if the hydraulic characteristics of a river reach are to be tied to its order, it seems desirable, as Rzhanitsyn suggested, to take into account the effect of all the tributaries on the order of the main stream. The new composition law for stream orders produces the ordering shown on figure 10. The italic number beside each stream segment was obtained by addition of the corresponding numbers of the segments whose confluence creates the segment in question. The order of the segment is the logarithm to the base 2 of the italic number. That is, the italic number equals 2N where N is the order of the stream. First-order streams are assigned the number 2 because where N=1, 2N=2. Once the first-order stream segments have been marked on the stream-order map, the numbers for the other segments are obtained by simple additions, and the orders by taking logarithms to the base 2.

GEOLOGICAL SURVEY RESEARCH 1965 PHOTOGRAPHIC COPYING USING REFLECTION- TRANSMISSION ILLUMINATION By ERNEST P. KRIER, Denver, Colo. Abstract. -Detail lost in shadow areas on photographic prints can be salvaged, for reproduction, by a copy process using trans\u00ad mitted light or a combination of transmitted and reflected light. Quality and detail in photographic copies of prints can be improved by using a combination of transmitted and reflected light. Most photographic copy negatives made from prints are made with reflected light and at best can show only the same detail as the original prints viewed in reflected light. Much additional detail is ap\u00ad parent on many prints when they are viewed with pre\u00ad dominantly transmitted light; black shadow areas be\u00ad come lighter, and contrasting tones appear. Prints made from copy negatives photographed with trans\u00ad mitted or a balanced combination of transmitted and reflected light generally have more detail in shadow areas than the original prints (Denstman and Schultz, 1963, p. 103). When reflected light is used, contrasting tones on a photographic print are obtained by a two-stage process of absorption by silver grains in the emulsion: first as light travels through the emulsion toward the paper backing, and second as it is reflected from the paper back through the emulsion and toward the viewer. The effect is thus proportional to the square of the absorption by the silver image (fig. 1). When transmitted light is used, this absorption occurs only once, and the ap\u00ad parent density is reduced by a factor proportional to the amount of absorption. Thus, the use of transmitted light (or a combination of transmitted and reflected light) opens up shadow areas but retains detail in light areas and is ideal for the best rendition of tones and detail in a copy print. Equipment for copying by the use of both reflected and transmitted light is easily arranged by combining a source for transmitted light-such as a contact printer, light table, or viewing box-with a source for reflected light-photoflood lamps (fig. 2.). Voltage regulators can be used to balance the light sources. REFLECTED LIGHT TRANSMITTED LIGHT FIGURE 1-Schematic diagrams showing reflection of light from a photographic print (top) and transmission of light through a photographic print (bottom). FIGURE 2.-Setup for photocopying with reflected or transmitted light or a combination of both. U.S. GEOL. SURVEY PROF. PAPER 525-B, PAGES Bl90-Bl91 BI90 KRIER B191 FIGURE 3.-Photocopy made with reflected light only. FIGURE 4.-Photocopy made with transmitted light only. A minimum of experimenting will ordinarily produce excellent results. A copy (fig. 3) made with reflected light is a faithful reproduction of the original as viewed in reflected light. A second copy (fig. 4) made with only transmitted light shows added detail in shadow areas and is more suitable for reproduction. The copy negatives were made on the same type film, were processed similarly, and were printed on the same type of paper. With the setup shown on figure 2, either transmitted light or transmitted and reflected light together can be used to bring out the detail in photo\u00ad graphic copies of prints. If the material to be copied is opaque, only reflected light can be used; if it is highly translucent, transmitted light alone may be used. Be\u00ad cause most photographic prints are neither opaque nor highly translucent, a combination of reflected and trans-mitted light usually will give the best results. Obvi\u00ad ously, the technique is limited to use of translucent prints that have no markings on the back. Use of a \"transparentizing\" solution may improve the trans\u00ad mitted image. The technique is particularly valuable in copying Polaroid prints, for which no negatives are available. It can greatly improve the quality of repro\u00ad duction not only in field photographic laboratories but also in the platemaking stage when prints are screened for reproduction.
