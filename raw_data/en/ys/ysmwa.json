Together we succeeded in cleaning up the Hudson. Today, the Hudson is the richest waterway in the North Atlantic with more pounds of fish per acre and biomass per gallon than any other waterway in the Atlantic Ocean. The miraculous resurrection of the Hudson inspired the creation of Riverkeepers on hundreds of waterways around the world. I serve as President of the Waterkeeper Alliance, the largest and fastest growing water protection group in the world with 350 waterkeepers in 46 countries. And I was representing many of them in lawsuits against coal burning power plants for discharging mercury into our waterways in the early 2000's. During that period, I was approached by many women who identified themselves as mothers of intellectually disabled kids, and each of them believed that their child had been injured by vaccines. They persuaded me to look at the science and that's what really sucked me into this issue. I saw immediately that there was a big chasm between what public health officials were telling Americans about vaccine safety and efficacy and what the actual peer-reviewed science would say. Q: Many believe that vaccines are safe because their doctors say they are. Why should people re-think this belief? A: People need to do their own research. Doctor's don't study vaccine injury in medical schools. Medical schools are largely financed by pharmaceutical companies and they teach a pharmaceutical paradigm. They're not teaching people how to improve their immune systems, and they teach virtually nothing about vaccine safety. The assumption is that all vaccines work and they never cause injury. People need to do their own research on that issue. The vaccine court has paid out over $4 billion in injuries that have been caused by vaccines - and HHS admits that less than one percent of vaccine related injuries are reported, so now multiply that by one hundred. Q: What is your greatest concern about the government mandating vaccinations? A: I have many concerns about that. My greatest concern is that vaccines are not safety-studied. And that is an artifact of the CDC's legacy, the Public Health Service, which was a quasi-military agency. The vaccine program was launched as a national security defense against biological attacks on our country. If the Russians attacked us, they wanted to make sure we could formulate and deploy a vaccine to two hundred million civilians with no regulatory impediments. But, they recognized that if they called vaccines a \"medicine\" they would have to do placebo-controlled, randomized testing which takes five years. So, they called them something else. They called them \"biologics\" and then biologics were exempted from safety testing. Back then, there were only three vaccines, and it didn't make much of an impact. But today, children are mandated to take 72 doses of 16 vaccines before the age of 18. None of them have ever been tested against placebo. Nobody knows what the risk profile is of those vaccines. And nobody knows whether the vaccines are causing more injuries than they're averting. And the science indicates that indeed, many of those vaccines - if not all of them - are causing more injuries than they are avoiding. Most people argue that vaccines are safe because the CDC says they're safe, because the WHO says they're safe, or because my doctor says they're safe. In fact, there are no studies that prove vaccines safe. There are no studies in which vaccinated populations are compared to unvaccinated populations and show vaccinated populations have better health outcomes. There are about 61 studies that we've uncovered that compare vaccinated populations and unvaccinated populations, and the vaccinated populations are always sicker. They have more diabetes, they have more autism, they have more special education, they have more hospital visits, more earaches, more auto immune diseases, they have more allergies, there's no study that we've ever been able to find that shows vaccinated populations are healthier. Q:Why should people be able to exercise their freedom in regard to what's put in their bodies? A: The answer to that should be self-evident. The government doesn't own your body and a person, a healthy person in particular, should not be compelled to submit to medical interventions without their permission. You know, we've signed numerous treaties including the Nuremberg Charter, the United Nations Charter for Human Rights, the Siracusa Principles, and others that say that that is one of the foundations of political freedom and western democracy. Q: Since you've started looking into vaccines and the vaccine industry, what's the most concerning thing that you have found? A: The explosion of chronic disease in children. We're the most vaccinated population on earth and the sickest. We have the highest mortality rates, we have the highest rates of auto-immune diseases and allergic diseases and neurodevelopmental diseases. We're looking at the sickest generation in history - 54% of our kids have chronic diseases and that's not normal. Prior to vaccines in 1940, only 6% of American kids had chronic disease. By 1986, that number rose to 12% and today's it's 54%. Q: How are you helping fight for the voiceless today in regard to legal battles over individual freedom? A: We are representing vaccine-injured kids in courts around the country, we're filing lawsuits all the time to protect people from forced vaccination, and to find remedies for people who have been injured. Q: You've been speaking out on this a lot, particularly right now with COVID going on, what kind of censorship have you faced? A: I've been censored from the beginning, 15 years. No newspaper in the country will run my editorials, and by the way, I've run hundreds of editorials prior to my vaccine involvement on environmental issues. They will not allow me to write editorials on vaccines, they won't allow me to debate on TV. (I've had one debate in 15 years and that was against Allen Dirchowitz earlier this year.) And now even social media is very open about the fact that they aren't allowing any discussions on the vaccines or any discussions on 5G. Q: Speaking of social media, we've been hearing a lot recently about major platforms' policies combatting misinformation. Why is what you're saying not \"misinformation?\" A: The term \"misinformation\" has nothing to do with whether or not a statement is true, the term \"misinformation\" in this context is a euphemism for any statement that disagrees with the prevailing government pronouncement and pharmaceutical paradigm, whether true or not. Most of the misinformation on vaccines is coming from the other side and there is no censorship. Q: Let's talk about the toxic and concerning materials that are found in vaccines, and why people should be aware of them. A: In terms of toxicity, the worst materials are adjuvants like mercury and aluminum, and those are horrendously neurotoxic. Mercury is the most neurotoxic element in the universe that is not radioactive. You wouldn't inject lead into a baby under any conditions - yet mercury is 1,000 times more neurotoxic than lead, and we are injecting it into our children. Then there are many other toxic chemicals and carcinogenic materials like borax and formaldehyde. There are also moral and religious objectives to the human fetal tissue that is in vaccines. Human fetuses are used as substrats, ground up and used to grow the viruses to create vaccines. Probably worse, from a health point of view, are some of the animal tissues, monkey and primate tissues, which are also ubiquitous because there are retro viruses in those tissues that are spreading in to the human genome. Some of them are carcinogenic like SV40 and N Virus 40. Other animal tissues include cocker spaniel tissues, insect tissues, pangolin tissues, and more. There have never been any studies on these individual ingredients on what happens when you inject them, and there have been no studies on the vaccine schedule as a whole. Q: Tell us about Children's Health Defense and what type of resources and content is available there for people to educate themselves on vaccines and other health issues. A: People should go to ChildrensHealthDefense.org. We've tried to really do the cutting edge analyses of scientific studies as they come out to make them accessible so that people can read them, but also to curate the information on our site so that we know it's scientifically accurate and you can feel safe using it.
