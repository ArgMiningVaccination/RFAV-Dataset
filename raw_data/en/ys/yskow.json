Rule 2(k), read with this rule cannot be interpreted to mean that an authorised medical attendant cannot prescribe medicines at any place other than at a Government hospital or his co nsulting room, if he chooses to do so. There should, therefore, be no objection to the reimbursement of the expenses. [G.I. MHA letter No. 7/17/60 \u2014AIS(III), dated 2 -8-1960, and 2 -2-1960 read with letter No. 7/9/61 \u2014AIS(III), dated 5 -8-1960.] 5.

[G.I. MHA letter No. 31/6/56 \u2014AIS (II), dated 27 -7-1956.] 2. State governments may take into consideration to facilities available within the State while referring the pat ients outside the State for treatment of special and malignant diseases: - Though this rule as amended permits All India Service officers and members of their families to get medical attendance/treatment outside the State for all diseases the actual intent ion in amending the rule is that the facilities for such treatment should, as far as possible be restricted to cases of special and malignant diseases like tuberculosis, cancer and polio or in respect of officer posted to under developed areas like Manipur and Tripura where reasonable and adequate facilities for treatment may not be available at a hospital within the State and where treatment at a 72 hospital in an adjoining State might be recommended. The State Government may bring this fact to notice of thei r medical authorities so that they might bear it in mind while recommending medical attendance/treatment in hospital outside the State. 2. The State Government may, however, at their discretion, permit officers in deserving cases to have treatment outside their State or other districts where the medical authorities are of opinion that there is immediate danger to life and that treatment outside the State is absolutely necessary. [G.I. MHA letter No. 7/7/60 \u2014AIS(III), dated 3 -6-1960.] 3. MoS can get medical treatment from doctors other than AMA: - Member of the Service can get medical treatment from doctors other than their authorised medical attendants (including doctors equal or immediately junior to the authorised medical attendants in the same hospital) o nly on the prior advice of their authorised medical attendants, who will further get the approval of the Chief Administrative Medical Officer of the State. The State Government can, however, allow the All India Service officers and the members of their fam ilies to get medical treatment from any government doctor stationed in the place where they are serving, if they declare principal medical officers of all separate hospitals to be the authorised medical attendants for them under rule 2(a) read with rule 2( d). [G.I. MHA letter No. 7/8/60 \u2014AIS (III), dated 9 -11-1960.] 4. Members of the family of the moS are also entitled to treatment by a Government specialist: - The Government of India have held that the provisions of the rule 6(1) are also applicable to a me mber of the family of the member of the Service and he/she may be entitled to treatment by a specialist provided the specialist is Government specialist. [G.I. MHA letter No. 7/3/64 \u2014AIS (III), dated 28 -1-1965.] GOVERNMENT OF INDIA'S ORDERS UNDER RULE 8 1. AMA could allow a moS for treatment at his residence if suitable facilities consistent with his/her status are not available at the govt. hospital: - Under rule 2(k)(v), treatment is defined to include such' accommodation as is ordinarily provided in the hospital to which the patient is admitted and is suited to his status. If, therefore, the authorised medical attendant is of the view that suitable facilities consistent with the status of the member of the Service are not available at the Government hospi tal, he could, under sub -rule (1), allow the member of the Service to receive medical treatment at his residence. [G.I. MHA letter No. 7/16/60 \u2014AIS (III), dated 4 -3-1961.] 2. It is the discretion of the AMA to decide the remoteness of a hospital considering the condition of the patient and distance of the hospital from the residence of the patient: - As remoteness' has not been defined in the rule, a doubt was raised as to whether any criteria, which should guide authorised medical attendants, in determinin g whether, in a particular case, a hospital was remote or not, had been prescribed. 2. It is not practicable to prescribe any absolute definition of remoteness in respect of any particular hospital merely with reference to its location, i.e. physical dista nce. A hospital may be at a considerable distance from the residence of a patient; but the condition of the patient may be such that he could safely be asked to get treatment in that hospital. On the other hand, there may be a patient whose condition is su ch that he 73 may not be able to attend the same hospital or even a hospital, which is nearer, but may have to be given treatment at his residence. Thus a hospital, which is not remote, for one case may have to be considered as remote for certain other cases. That is why, in this, as in number of other matters under these rules, complete discretion has been vested in the authorised medical attendant. He is trusted to decide each case on its merits after taking into consideration the location of the hospital, t he condition of the patient and the severity of illness. Any certificate issued by him may, therefore, be accepted by audit authorities without question. [G.I. MHA letter No. 7/2/61 \u2014AIS (III), dated 19 -4-1961.] 3. Members of the family of a moS are entitle d to received treatment at their residence if certified by AMA: - Under rule 8 read with rule 4, the family of a member of the Service is entitled to receive treatment at their residence only if certificates prescribed in sub -rule (3) of Rules are furnishe d by the Authorised Medical Attendant. [G.I. MHA letter No. 7/9/64 \u2014AIS (III), dated 17 -7-1964.] 4.1 MoS and his/her members of the family are entitled to received treatment at their residence if certified by AMA and claim reimbursement thereon: - The Gover nment of India have held that if the Authorised Medical Attendant is of the opinion that suitable facilities for hospitalisation are not available, or the condition of the patient is such that he cannot be shifted to the hospital without risk of deteriorat ion in his health, he may give treatment to the member of the Service (or the member of family) at his residence. In case where illness is not severe or the disease is of a chronic nature, the patient should consult the Authorised Medical Attendant, either at his consulting room (if it has been so maintained) or in the hospital as an out -door patient. 4.2 However, if an Authorised Medical Attendant, of his own free will, examines a patient at his/her residence and prescribes medicines, there is no objection if the State Government permits reimbursement of the cost of the medicines. G.I. MHA letter No. 7/7/64 \u2014AIS(III), dated Feb. 1965). GOVERNMENT OF INDIA'S ORDERS UNDER RULE 9 1. Fees paid to compounders for administering injection and nurses for attending patients at the residence is not admissible: - It has been decided that the fees paid to compounders for administering injections and to nurses for attending to a member of the Service/members of the family of the member of the Service at their residence ar e not admissible. [G.I. MHA letter No. 7/20/61 \u2014AIS (III), dated 25 -4-1962.] GOVERNMENT OF INDIA'S ORDERS UNDER RULE 14 1. Government has inherent power to grant any concession in deserving cases which are otherwise not provided in these rules : - The effect of clause (i), as far as the member of the Service is concerned, is that he is not entitled to reimbursement of any cost otherwise' than as expressly provided in these rules. But, so far as the Government is concerned, its inherent power to grant, in sui table and deserving cases, any' concession relating to medical treatment or attendance not authorised by the rules is expressly saved by clause (ii). The expression not authorised must be construed to mean not sanctioned' or not justified' by these Rule s. [G.I. MHA letter No. 7/10/61 \u2014AIS (III), dated 10 -7-1961.] 74 2. Reimbursement of expenditure other than a Government hospital can be granted in exceptional circumstances by the State Government: - Clause (ii) can be invoked by the State Government for gran ting to a member of the Service reimbursement of expenditure incurred by him for the treatment of a member of his family in a hospital other than a Government hospital outside the State provided very exceptional circumstances justify such action. [G.I. MHA letter No. 7/13/62 \u2014AIS (III), dated 1 -2-1962.] 3.1. Additional concession can be granted by the State Government in individual, deserving and suitable cases for treatment abroad: - Clause (ii) does not empower the Government to grant to the members of the All India Services general additional concessions not covered by the rules. But they can grant in individual, deserving and suitable cases any concession within or outside the framework of the rules. Accordingly the State Government can under this rule, p ermit reimbursement of the cost of medical treatment and attendance taken abroad in a suitable and deserving case, even though it is outside the scope of the rules as laid down in rule 1(2). In such cases, however, the Government of India do not, as a matt er of principle, accept any liability, though, in very special cases, they make payment equivalent to what proper treatment would have cost in India itself. 2. The powers under clause (ii) can be exercised by the State Government without any limitations. R ule 13 of these rules does not control the action of the State Govt. in such cases. It is also not necessary for them to consult the Central Government in this regard. [G.I. MHA File No. 8/62/62 \u2014AIS (III), dated 29 -8-62.] 4. Guidelines to be adopted in de aling with cases relating to Medical Treatment abroad: - The question of reimbursement of expenses incurred over treatment abroad for Central Government employees has been further considered and it has now been decided that the guidelines as in the annexu re to Department of Personnel and A.R. letter No. 11023/7/83 \u2014AIS (III), dated 7th November 1983 (reproduced below) should be adopted in dealing with the cases relating to request for medical treatment abroad. 2. The above decision also applies to members o f the All India Service serving at the Centre. 3. The State Government have been requested to consider adopting the same policy in respect of the members of All India Services working in connection with the affairs of the State as well as the State Governm ent employees. [G.I., DP&AR letter No.11023/7/83 \u2014AIS(III), dated the 7th November 1983.] Guidelines to be adopted in dealing with cases relating to Medical Treatment abroad. (i) As a rule, reimbursement of cost of medical treatment incurred abroad should not be allowed. (ii) In exceptional cases necessitating treatment of a kind yet to be widely established in the country, where Government servants on medical advise choose to go on their own for treatment abroad, reimbursement could be authorised by the Director General of Health Services but should be limited to the expenditure that would have been incurred had such treatment been received in India in a Government Hospital or in a private hospital or nursing home specially recognised and accepted by the 75 Director General of Health Service. The question of reimbursement of air passage in such cases should not arise at all. (iii) Foreign exchange may be released to Government servants for purpose of treatment abroad to the same extent as is permissible to p rivate citizens. (iv) Hospitals and clinics indicated in paragraph 3 below have facilities for specialist treatment for which requests are generally received for treatment abroad and in ordinary of which treatment facilities in ordinary Government hospita ls are still inadequate. The services provided by these hospitals may be availed by eligible Government servants. In such cases reimbursement should be allowed subject to D. G. H. S. being satisfied about the reasonableness of the claim. (v) Pending cases of reimbursement claims may be dealt with on the basis of the guidelines indicated in (i) to (iv) above. NOTE. \u2014 Only those cases which may have been brought up for consideration on or after 9th February, 1982 and not finally decided by that date would be deemed to be pending cases to qualify for such consideration. 2. The following ailments have been identified by the D. G. H. S. as being such for which facilities for treatment in India are not yet widely established. (i) Cadaver Kidney Transplant. (ii) Old operated by -pass surgery cases (in which the initial operation was done abroad) needing revascularization. (iii) Bone Marrow transplant. (iv) Operative correction for high myopia cases. (v) Complex cyanote -Heart -Lesion and newly born infants suffe ring from heart diseases. 2.1 To consider cases of the above type, a Medical Board should be constituted at the State level by the State Director of Health Services. The Board should make specific recommendations and also give reasons for recommending trea tment abroad. It should also certify that the treatment is not available in India. The certificate should be endorsed by the Director of Health Service, and sent to the Director General of Health Services, New Delhi, for his approval: 2.2 For purposes of r eimbursement, as envisaged in these guidelines, the schedule of charges as applicable for private ward treatment at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, in force from time to time should be adopted. 3.

MHA letter No. 7/10/63 \u2014AIS(III), dated September, 1963.] 6. reimbursement of the cost of medical treatment taken from a private practitioner can be allowed in exceptional cases if the State Governments are satisfied with the circumstances: - The Govt. of India have held that ordinarily a member of the Service is expected to receive treatment from the Authorised Medical Attendant' which term includes the principal medical officer' appointed by the 77 Government to attend its officers, a medical officer equal in rank or immediately junior to such principal officer a nd attached to the same hospital or dispensary. In exceptional cases, however, re -imbursement of the cost of medical treatment incurred on the advice of the private practitioner can be reimbursed by the State Government by invoking Rule 14(ii) of the A.I.S . (Medical Attendance) Rules, 1954, if the State Government are satisfied of the existence of special circumstances in which treatment could not be had through the Authorised Medical Attendant and the refusal to re-imbursement such cost, is likely to cause undue hardship to the officer. In so far as Central Government employees are concerned, their cases are regulated in terms of Ministry of Finance O.M. No. 2192 \u2014EV(5)/62. dated the 17th April, 1963. [G.I.

The State G overnment are the competent authority to regulate such procedural matters. [G.I. MHA letter No. 7/2/65 \u2014AIS (III), dated 20th April, 1965.] 8. State Governments are competent to grant any additional concession and to allow reimbursement not authorised under this rule in deserving cases: - The Government of India have held that under rule 14(ii) \u2014 (i) The State Governments are themselves competent to grant to an All India Service officer serving in connection with the affairs of the State any concession relat ing to medical attendance or treatment, which is not authorised under the A.I.S.

(ii) It is open to the State Government to allow re -imbursement of expenses when treatment has been taken from a doctor other than the Authorised Medical Attendant in case of emergencies due to the non \u2014existence of any Government/re cognised hospital within a reasonable distance from the place where the patient fell ill.

At present all cases where Central Government servants & members of their families receive medical attendance/treatment in emergent circumstances from sour ces other than those from whom it is permissible under the relevant Medical Attendance Rules, are referred to the Ministries of Finance/Health for allowing reimbursement of the Medical expenses by special sanction. Such cases are referred to the Ministries of Finance/ Health irrespective of the amount involved. In the past it has been noticed that in the majority of such cases medical attendance and /or treatment were received either from Railway/ Military/ Factory/ Local Board (District and Municipal Board s, Local Funds and Panchayats) hospital or from doctors attached thereto, or from private practitioners, due to the non -existence of any Government/recognised hospital within a reasonable distance from the place where the patient fell ill. With a view to c utting out delays in the settlement of such cases caused by frequent references to the Ministries of Finance and Health, the President has been pleased to delegate powers to all Ministries/Head of Departments to allow refund of medical expenses upto a maxi mum limit of Rs. 50/ - in each case where they are satisfied that although refund is not permissible under the strict application of the various Medical Attendance Rules, the circumstances of the case warranted medical attendance/treatment being had from ho spitals and doctors mentioned above, in the absence of Government/recognised hospital or doctors within a reasonable distance from the place where the patient fell ill. The reasonableness of the distance may be determined with reference to the nature and s everity of the ailment in each case. Further, refunds as above may be allowed only to the extent admissible under the relevant Medical Attendance Rules and subject to the general spirit of those rules being observed. Doubtful cases should continue to be re ferred to the Ministries of Finance/Health. (ii) Copy of Min. of Finance (Exp.)O.M.No. F. 21(2) EV (B)/62, dated 17th April, 1963. 1.

Ministries and Head of Departments may hencefor th allow refund of medical expenses upto Rs. 100/ - in each case in relaxation of the relevant Medical Attendance Rules subject to the consideration and conditions set out in the aforesaid orders. 3. The powers referred to above may also be exercised in cas es where medical attendance and treatment is received in a private hospital, as a result of serious accident, or on the advice of the Authorised Medical Attendant. 4. These powers can also be exercised in cases where medical attendance and treatment is rec eived from Government doctors other than the Authorised Medical Attendant, or in Government recognised hospitals or institutions without following the 91 prescribed procedure of obtaining prior approval of the Authorised Medical Attendant, Chief Administrativ e Medical Officer of the State etc. and in cases where medical tests like X -ray, Blood examination etc. are got done in private clinics due to absence of facilities in Government hospitals/institutions or due to severity of ailment which confines the patie nt to bed. 5.

The Director of Health Services, West Bengal will be deemed to be the final authority to decide whether the charges on account of accommodation and other expenses recovered from a Central Government employee in such a hospital are reasonable and suited to the status of the Government servant concerned. The same procedure may be adopted in the case o f hospitals in respect of which the Schedules of Charges have been published by the Government of India but such Schedules have undergone changes, till such charges are communicated to all concerned by the Government of India, Ministry of Health.
