Having landed himself with a plush job with an MNC just after his MBA, his life revolved around his job \u2014 either travelling or spending long hours in the office amidst sales strategies, target schedules, logistics planning, vendor management et al \u2014 and he was enjoying every bit of it. And why not? He had just been given an out of turn promotion and a hefty pay hike. So far so good. But that's when calamity struck. While taking a sales meeting one evening, Anurag complained of heavy breathing and soon collapsed. He was rushed to a hospital and diagnosed as having suffered a mild heart attack. Feel the pulse. Traditional wisdom is back \u2014 and a day not too sooner. In fact, Arun is not alone. After dabbling with modern science for decades, more Indians are finding comfort and cure in age-old Indian food, therapies and practices \u2014 albeit primarily because newer scientific research into nutrition and therapies are conclusively proving their efficacy for a healthier and disease-free life. Of course, there's no jumping off the greasy, gravy train for now. Nor are night-outs expected to be cut short? Far from it \u2014 crispy wafers, lip-smacking burgers and pizzas or thirst-quenching colas are still part of the Indian palate. Rocking night life's on, too. But alongside, there's an ever-growing tribe of people on the hinges who are going back to nature big time \u2014 and imbibing the lost virtues of routine, proper sleep timings, exercises and postures. Again, essential ingredients of Indian food for centuries \u2014 mustard oil, coarse grains, vegetables and fruits, organic crops \u2014 are all back, as are rejuvenation therapies, yoga and meditation and alternative therapies such as homeopathy, ayurveda and naturopathy, among others. And not without reason. In fact, the most compelling reason behind this change has been the rising desire among people to lead a quality life and get past poor eating habits and sedentary lifestyles \u2014 more as a matter of choice, rather than necessity, as typified by Anurag. Increasing awareness about the complexities of urban life, environmental hazards, health problems and preventive maintenance, too, seem to have been contributing to the changing lifestyles. Doctors are already noticing the shift in preferences. Explains Dr Ambrish Mithal, senior consultant, endocrinology, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, New Delhi, \"There's definitely a preference towards natural practices for overall healthcare maintenance among people. But when it comes to serious or life-threatening diseases, the preferred mode of treatment still is modern science.\" Dr Mithal should know. As a leading endocrinologist, he is often seen advising his patients to shun sedentary lifestyle and get back to natural elements to prevent and manage their diseases. \"Even as way of life, a balanced life in tune with nature's discipline is best for the people,\" he maintains. That's a chill pill \u2014 a prescription \u2014 which more Indians seemingly are following in letter and spirit. And with what effect \u2014 yoga and 'pranayam' alone are making waves and millions are latching on to meditative 'asanas' as a guide to their good health. Ishi Khosla, clinical nutritionist & director, Whole Food, acknowledges the 'farm fresh' change and feels that the stranglehold of modern science, which had taken a firm control over people's mind in the last two decades, is definitely weakening. \"It looks like we've been through a cycle and people now understand the benefits of traditional therapies and practices. More people are adopting healthy lifestyle options and there's been a major shift in eating habits.\" She, however, warns that all claims of natural and herbal are not genuine and the people must understand the side effects and other nutritional issues from qualified experts. But the trend is too strong to ignore, she points out. In fact, a quick look at the growth rate of the alternative healthcare industry reaffirms the changing preferences. Take homeopathy, for instance. The therapy accounts for 14% or Rs 630 crore of the alternative healthcare industry, estimated currently at approximately Rs 7,000 crore. Homeopathy has also been witnessing 25% yearly growth over the last five years. This apart, the segment has seen entry of new corporate brands, thereby projecting the emergence of a potential healthcare corporate sector. Elaborates Dr Mukesh Batra, CMD, Dr Batra's Positive Health Clinic, \"Just count the advantages: Homeopathy is cheap, safe, has no side-effects and works holistically towards long-term cure rather than providing suppressive and short-term relief. Of course, we see a pill-popping culture today with rampant antibiotic abuse, but this is also forcing people to look for alternatives which don't have adverse effects. Homeopathy fits the bill perfectly and is the second largest system of medication in the world.\" The proof of the pooding lies in the eating. Small wonder then that alternative therapies today are not only occupying mindspace but also entering individual homes and corporate spas because of their proven efficacy. In fact, rejuvenation, yoga and meditation and alternative pathways such as Reiki, crystal and stone touch, flower medicine and many old traditional techniques are getting popular like never before. Explains Ranjiv Malhotra, practitioner, neural wave therapy, a re-emerging ancient Indian art and a spiritual-based therapeutic technology: \"In a society grappling with career, class and health issues, Gen X is seen ailing with numerous kinds of disorders and situations mainly related to their lifestyle changes, hectic life and stressful long days of work; that are far from being treated with the normal scientific medical treatments. Neural wave therapy, clubbed with the new emerging quantum physics, is all set to challenge the conventional scientific mindset and can cure physical and emotional ailments with significant overall development of self.\" That may sound complicated, but Malhotra's patients vouch for its results. Cut to the elementary level, however, there's been a slow but steady change in the eating pattern and much of traditional Indian diet \u2014 albeit in newer forms and packaging \u2014 is getting back on the dining table. In fact, be it store shelves or kitchen cabinets, what draw attention now are probiotics, organic grains, fruits and vegetables and mono unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)-rich oils such as olive and mustard. Of course, the industry is fledgling and there's a lot of ground to be covered before this changes the Indian palate. But early movers are already seeing a strong business potential and planning a slew of activity centred around the health and wellness platform. Take mustard oil, for instance. Termed the poor man's oil, this cooking medium was long ago dumped as being too risky for human consumption. But eversince newer research came in and the myths around sunflower and other vegetable oils were shattered (too high in PUFA), mustard is back in flavour \u2014 fresher (read organic) and in newer variants. Ms Khosla spells out the benefits of the cold pressed oil. \"Mustard oil is rich in MUFA and low in saturated fats and helps in cholesterol reduction. It also has more antioxidants and vitamins as compared to refined edible oils, this prevents early ageing and also protects the body by building strong immunity. Organic oils are preferred as they are free of pesticides,\" she points out. Vivek Puri, MD, Puri Oil Mills, captures the potential when he estimates the Indian mustard oil market at Rs 1,200 crore and growing currently at an annual rate of 22%. \"With the introduction of organic mustard oil, this market will get a substantial boost, as its export potential is quite high, considering that the global organic market is growing at the rate of more than 20%,\" he reasons. Arguably, the business in oil is not slippery for Puri. And some such for a bevy of products which has sprung up to tap the growing healthcare concerns. In fact, marketers \u2014 from pharma and FMCG sectors to white goods and even real estate \u2014 are hitch-hiking on to the health bandwagon and effecting critical differentials in the marketplace. An AC which gives you a zero-bacteria environment, a TV which promises to save your eyes from stress, a refrigerator which keeps your eatables healthy or a realty project which offers a green and relaxed ambience \u2014 packaging nature in its myriad hues is the latest mantra for dressing up marketing dos. Heritage and traditional wisdom are definitely the flavour of the season \u2014 both for consumers and marketers. Take a step back for a leap forward.
