The elder Dr. Mayo came to Rochester in 1863 to practice medicine. His sons assisted him dur ing their boyhood years and later joined him in the practice of medicine. As the demand for their services increased, the Mayos invited other physicians to work with them. This pioneering venture in the private group practice of medicine became known in t he early 1900s as Mayo Clinic. This name today descr ibes an organization of over 3,300 scientists and medical and surgical specialists working together as a team for the advancement of medical and biomedical education, research in medicine and related sciences, and medical care. Mayo awarded its first Ph.D. degree in 1917 in affiliation with the University of Minnesota. Since 1984, Mayo has been an independent, degree granting institution. In January 1989, MCGSBS became a separate unit that administers Ph. D. and Master's degree programs in the biomedical sciences. Enrollment currently includes approximately 300 Ph.D. and M.D.- Ph.D. candidates, and 100 Master's candidates in biomedical science. Other educational components of Mayo Clinic include: Mayo Clinic School of Graduate Medical Education, organized in 1915 to offer programs of graduate medical education. Enrollment currently includes nearly 1,600 residents and fellows in clinical fields. Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine (MC ASOM) , an undergraduate medical school offering the M.D. degree, opened in 1972. Current enrollment includes over 200 students on the Rochester, Minnesota campus and 200 on the MC ASOM Arizona campus . Mayo Clinic School of Health Sciences, organized in 1973 to provid e training and certification in the health professions allied to medicine. The school offers 120 programs with an enrollment of more than 1,800. Mayo Clinic School of Continuous Professional Development, organized in 1977 to provide continuing education for care providers within Mayo Clinic, nationally and internationally. Mayo Clinic is accredited by The Higher Learning Commission , https://www.hlcommission.org/ . Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science i s registered with the Minnesota Office of Higher Education pursuant to Minnesota Statutes sections 136A .61 to 136A .71. Registration is not an endorsement of the institution. Credits earned at the institution may no t tran sfer to all other institutions. 8 Faculty All staff appointments are made to Mayo Clinic and this staff constitutes the faculty for the educational programs of Mayo Clinic. The 4,000 plus faculty members include full- time investigators in the biomed ical sciences, clinician investigators, and clinicians. Each member of the staff is full- time salaried and individual staff members have ample opportunity to teach. Members of the staff have the overall responsibility for undergraduate and graduate educati on in medicine and the biomedical sciences, for continuing education and research, as well as for the care of patients. Graduate faculty privileges are awarded to qualified faculty members with interest in delivering graduate level courses and in supervisi ng candidates for graduat e degrees. See listing of graduate faculty with full privileges and their research interests here . Facilities Educational programs, clinical practice and research are con ducted within three key locations ; Mayo Clinic campus in Rochester, Minnesota; Jacksonville, Florida; and Phoenix and Scottsdale, Arizona. Technology Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Arizona and Florida are linked via a sophisticated telecommunications system, which provides videoconferencing and data transmission. Staff and students in Rochester, Arizona and Florida can have live, interactive courses and seminars via TV monitors. In addition, Mayo has a telephone dialing and pager system that ties all three sites together. Mayo Clinic also provides delivery of education in a virtual setting to accommodate students who cannot be physically present in a classroom on the M ayo campus. MCGSBS utilizes Blackboard Collaborate, a web conferencing/webinar platform designed for use in online teaching , in addition to Zoom and other virtual delivery tools. The Education Technology Center and Learning Solutions Center have partnered to provide resources for students and instructors for learning in a virtual setting. Graduate Student Association The Mayo Graduate Student Association is comprised of Ph.D. students pursuing graduate degrees at MCGSBS . Membership includes a representative (rep) from each track, a first year student rep , an Arizona and Florida rep, a MCGSBS Education Committee member rep, an M.D. - Ph.D. program rep, social media rep, Mayo Clinic Alumni Association rep, International student rep, MRFA rep, IMSD rep, Communications Liaison, Treasurer, Secretary, and prior year president (s) emeritus . Its purpose is to facilitate interaction among graduate students, and among students, faculty, and administration. It provides a means for students to give input concerning coursework and curriculum and other MCGSBS issues. 9 Career Development Internships What is a Career Development Internship? Career Development Internships (CDIs) are MCGSBS -funded opportunities for upper -level PhD students to spend 100 hours (or more) as interns in one of several career environments. CDI internships allow MCGSBS students to explore possible interests, network with professionals, contribute to the mission of the CDI partner organization and gain informed appreciation for career options. The goal of the CDI program is to provide MCGSBS students with hands -on experience in diverse career environments to assist with making informed career path decisions. CDI activities are flexible, allowing approximately 100 hours of paid study leave from MCGSBS during one quarter. For off -site CDI opportunities requiring travel, the CDI program may cover travel and housing costs. Internships are individualized. The MCGSBS intern and sponsoring CDI partner work together to design the ideal experience. We are ready to partner with you to create a CDI experience designed just for you! For qu estions, please contact Carol (CJ) Prestegard -5277 to: prestegard.carol@mayo.edu. Process: PhD and MD/PhD students currently in MCGSBS are eligible to apply if they have: 1. successfully completed the written and oral qualifying exams, 2. are in good academic standing at MCGSBS (average GPA of 3.0 or higher), 3. have selected a mentor and an area of research, and 4. are making satisfactory PhD thesis research progress. The CDI application includes the following supporting documents, to be combined into a single pdf and emailed to Career Development Applications . If it is a competitive CDI opportunity, the single pdf will need to be received by the deadline specified in the email announcement. 1. CDI Application 2. Letter of recommendation from thesis mentor / or email with thesis mentor's support 3. CV or resume 4. 1-page single spaced statement of interest a. Specify which of the CDI experiences is requested and an explanation for why you are interested in this particular opportunity. Include information you wish the CDI partner to consider. The Special CDI Offering is competitive. Applications are collected for an intern al deadline, and then reviewed internally and by the external CDI collaborator of interest. CDI awards are based on matching qualifications and interests of the applicant with the proposed CDI partner. Applicants may indicate only one CDI collaborator in their application. 10 CDI Structure and Students Responsibility of Documentation After a student has been selected for a CDI experience, there is the expectation that the experience will be documented and provide to MCGSBS. 1. Selected applicants will be provided with contact information for the CDI collaborator and will have the responsibility to initiate contact. a. Record of Initial Meeting (form) 2. Working with the CDI collaborator, the student will then develop a CDI Plan to be summarized in a 1 -2 page single -spaced .pdf document a. The CDI Plan will indicate how the 100 -hour internship will occur (a single block of time, or multiple contacts), the name and contact information for the CDI collaborator mentor, and a brief descripti on of planned activities. The 1 -2 page CDI Plan summary should contain a budget proposal estimating reimbursable costs associated with any ground travel and/or accommodations. Meal costs are the responsibility of the intern. For CDI experiences involving t ravel off campus, trip and reimbursement arrangements must be made through the MCGSBS office. 3. Prior to or shortly after the internship ending, the student will host a meeting with the CDI collaborator to review the experience. a. Record of Summary Meeting (form) 4. Within 14 days of completion of the CDI experience, the intern will submit, to MCGSBS administration, a brief report summarizing their experience. a. The CDI Summary will summarize in a 1 - 2 page single -space document the CDI experience. 5. Evaluation of the CDI experience will be captured in similar surveys provided to the student and the CDI partner. The focus of the evaluation will not be on the intern performance, but on the value of the CDI experience.

Support for additional years b eyond the fifth (fourth for M.D. -Ph.D. students) must be provided by the mentor . Stipends for all graduate students are set at a uniform level ( planned for $ 35,587 for 2022- 2023) and are reviewed at regular intervals. Students who are accepted into the M. D.-Ph.D. program are provided a fellowship with stipend, tuition, and fees. The stipend is provided by Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine (MC ASOM) while the student is in the M.D. portion of training . MCGSBS provides up to four years of funding for the Ph.D. portion of the program. Extensions in the Ph.D. program beyond four years must be financially supported by the mentor . MCASOM and MCGSBS tuition and fees are provided by a full fellowship for students accepted into this combined M.D. -Ph.D. program, with satisfactory performance. Clinical residents and research fellows accepted into the Master's program continue to receive the salary from their primary appointment and do not receive a stipend from MCGSBS. Employees pursuing Master's degrees on a part -time basis receive their usual employee salary. Tuition /Program Fees Annual tuition for graduate students is $27,000 for Ph.D . students. Tuition is $700 per quarter credit. Tuition is provided by a full fellowship for students who are enrolled in the Ph.D and M.D. -Ph.D. degree programs of MCGSBS . Extramural sources of funds are used to defray tuition when appropriate and all eligible students are expected to apply for individual extramural awards. Program Fees are charged for many Master's programs to cover administrative costs. More details are available on the MCGSBS Master's Programs intranet site , including options for financial support. Registration Mayo courses are primarily intended for individuals appointed to the degree programs of MCGSBS . Others may enroll if they show appropriate prerequisites and secure the course director's approval . Tracks may have differing course enrollment criteria. Enrollment in some courses is very limited; degree candidates are given preference for these courses. Registration information is available on the MCGSBS intranet site . Registration for MCGSBS courses is accomplished through the Registrar's Office and must be made online before the applicable deadline (see Academic Calendar on previous pages ). *An individual must have an active Mayo employment or e ducation role to be eligible for MCGSBS courses. Registration for credit Unless provided through a fellowship or scholarship, students will be billed for tuition. Tuition is refunded if a course is cancelled. Changes in registration The current tuition refund policy is available on the Financial Aid intranet site . Retroactive registration after a course is completed is not permitted. Students who wish to register for a course after the registration deadline date must have written permission from the course director. Some courses may only allow late registrants up until the first day of class. 12 Grading System MCGSBS uses two grading systems: A Outstanding S Satisfactory A- Excellent N Not satisfactory B+ Very Good P Pass B Acceptable F Fail B- Marginal/below standards expected C+ Below standards C Poor/lowest performance to receive credit F Unsatisfactory The Grade Point Average (GPA) is based on: A = 4.0 B- = 2.7 A- = 3.7 C+ = 2.3 B+ = 3.3 C = 2.0 B = 3.0 F = 0.0 The grading system to be used is determined by the course director at the time the course is established. A grade of \"S\", \"P\", or \"N\" is not considered in determination of GPA. A grade of \"F\" is considered in determination of the GPA if the course is assigned the standard letter grading scale. The GPA, which is recorded on the official transcript, is calculated by dividing the sum of all grade points earned by the sum of all credits assigned grade points. Students do not receive credits for courses in which they received an \"F\" grade. In addition to the grades, the transcripts show the following, if applicable (see list below). Students have a maximum of one year to make up any deficiency. If the deficiency is not corrected within the year, the transcript will show an \"F\" or \"N\" for the course. CRX Credit by examination I Incomplete PD Proficiency demonstrated and transfer credits awarded R Indicates a student registere d for a course, did not attend, and did not off icially withdraw W Withdrawn WVD Course waived T Transfer course X Continuous registration /multi -term . A course that is continued over more than one quarter is given an \"X\" until the final quarter, when a grade is assigned. Credits are counted in the quarter the grade is entered. Z Repeated course Students may retake a course one time to improve their grade with the permission of their program director and the course director. The higher grade will appear on the transcript and will be used in computation of the GPA. Definition of Credit Hour Credit is determined by the number of contact hours per week. A one- hour lecture per week equals one credit per quarter. A quarter is usually 12 weeks. In some courses, credit is also given for laboratory time. 13 Course Numbering Graduate courses are designated with a 5 \u2014 or 6\u2014 number. The 5 \u2014 level courses are introductory graduate co urses. The 6 \u2014 level courses include MCGSBS core courses and the track courses considered to be at the boundary of what is known or done in a particular field. They can be expected to be exceptionally rigorous. Residence Requirement Regardless of how many transfer credits are awarded, candidates for graduate degrees from MCGSBS must complete a minimum period in residence after admission to their degree program. For Ph.D. degree candidates, the minimum period of residence will be two years (start date to end date) , and for Master's degree candidates the period is one year. Your Transcript Current learners and alumni employed by Mayo Clinic may request a transcript online through EdLink, the student portal . To request an official copy of your transcript, click on Student Records from the home menu. Directions on how to print an unofficial academic transcript are found on the MCGSBS Policies and Procedures intranet site . Student Responsibility Each graduate student must complete all requirements for a degree established by MCGSBS and the student's track. It is the stude nt's personal responsibility to be aware of and to understand these requirements. A student's mentor may not assume these responsibilities, nor substitute, waive, or exempt the student from any established requirement or academic standard. Such exemptions may, however, be proposed for consideration by MCGSBS . MCGSBS reserves the right to modify requirements at any time. Extensions Ph.D. appointments are for up to five years and M.D.- Ph.D. appointments are for up to four years in the Ph.D. program. Extensions beyond the fifth year for Ph.D. students and beyond four years for M.D.- Ph.D. students are permitted with evidence of satisfactory performance and a recommendation signed by at least four of the five members of the student's Thesis Advisory Committee an d the program director. Each extension is for a maximum of one year. If a Ph.D. student is extended into a sixth year or an M.D.-Ph.D. student into a fifth year, the student's stipend and benefits must be provided by the mentor . For more details, see the Extension Request Proc edure and Extension Request Form found on the MCGSBS intranet site . Confidentiality of Student Records The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) afford students certain rights with resp ect to their education records. The FERPA policy is av ailable on the MCGSBS Policies and Procedures intranet site. Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science upholds all federal and state laws that preclude discrimination on the basis of race, sex, age, religion, national origin, marital status, sexual orientation, disabilities, or veteran status. 14 Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Biomedical Sciences Degree Program Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Track (BMB) Biomedical Engineering and Physiology Track (BMEP) Clinical and Translational Science Track (CTS) Immunology Track (IMM) Molecular Pharmacol ogy and Experimental Therapeutics Track (MPET) Neuroscience Track (NSC) Regenerative Sciences Track (REGS) Virology and Gene Therapy Track (VGT) Purpose and Philosophy The Biomedical Sciences Ph.D. Program is intended to train students in the most modern approaches to biomedical research, and to assist with development of analytical, technical, oral, and written communication skills, which allow students to become independent investigators of the most important and challenging problems in biomedical research. Students are provided with a supportive atmosphere where they can find role models and mentors to emulate in the development of their research skills and begin acculturation into the biomedical research community. Courses introduce students to the body of information most important to their subsequent research endeavors and other educational activities facilitate the development of independent learning skills. Students are assisted with formulation of career goals and pathways which best utilize their individual talents and skills. Mayo Clinic 's Ph.D. program places heavier emphasis on research training than on course work. This philosophy is a natural outgrowth of the institution's long history as a center for investigation in the life sciences. Courses are, nevertheless, an integral part of the Ph.D. program providing the intellectual foundation necessary for a well -rounded scientist. A minimum of 66 credits is required of all Ph.D. students matriculating 2020 and forward; 42 for matriculants p rior to 2020. (Difference now granting credit for Predoctoral Research course registration vs. no credit .) Mayo Clinic 's graduate level courses in specific disciplines of the basic sciences will be adequate preparation for most students. All Ph.D. candid ates must complete at least two years of full- time course registration at Mayo to be eligible for the degree. Admission Appointment Requirements To be considered for admission to the Ph.D. program, applicants must: 1. Hold a bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university with a minimum 3.0 grade point average based on a 4.0 scale and supply the official transcript . a.

Ph. D. and M.D.- Ph.D. students will be notified by MCGSBS when they are required to take the refresher course and no grade will be assigned. 16 Area of Specialization/Track In addition to the core courses, track courses are also required. These courses are chosen with the aid and approval of the student's mentor . Courses required by the different tracks are outlined in the next section. Any remaining credits needed to meet th e minimum 66 required credits may be selected from any area that the student and mentor deem appropriate and necessary. The typical program structure is as follows: Year I Core, track course work, and laboratory rotations Year II Advanced courses and commencement of thesis research Year III, IV, & V Primarily thesis research with some additional advanced courses, seminars, and journal clubs . All students enrolled in the Ph.D. program are full- time students. Full -time enrollment each quarter may includ e any combination of course work, laboratory rotations or research. This does not preclude students from registering for research before course work is complete. These students retain full -time enrollment status and will be graded on the S -N scale. No credit hours will be assigned, and research is not calculated in the GPA. Students who have completed all course work and are engaged in full -time thesis research must register for research each quarter. Laboratory Rotations Each student must complete three laboratory rotations in three different laboratories for a total of six credits. Rotations must be done in the laboratories of faculty with full graduate faculty privileges. These credits count towards the track credits required. Some compa rable research experiences already completed may be considered to substitute for a required lab rotation. Eligible experiences for consideration include: Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF); Mayo Post -baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) ; Graduate Research Education Program (GREP) ; and r elevant Master's degree or other post -baccalaureate experience. For more details see the Lab Rotations Policy on the MCGSBS Policies and Procedures intranet site . Mentor A Ph.D. degree mentor must have fu ll graduate faculty privileges and must be selected after three laboratory rotations have been completed. For more details see the Mentor Selection, Withdrawal and Transfer Policy on the MCGSBS Policies and Procedures intranet site . Official Degree Planning Tool s The use of a Degree Planning Tool (DPT) is required and allows students to list the course work to fulfill degree requirements, including transfer credits. Fifty percent of the credits counting toward degree must be graded on the A -F grading system. The DPT must be completed during the first academic year and should be updated as courses are completed throughout the training program. The DPT should be reviewed periodically with the mentor or program director; frequency of review is at the program's discretion. Variation from the original course plan must be approved by the program director. A final completed DPT must be submitted to the school when a tentative defense date has been determined to be cleared to graduate. The DPT is available on the MCGSBS intranet site under For Students/General Forms/Resources/PhD Forms . Ph.D. students who matriculated prior to 2015 are allowed to submit a Degree Planning Form (DPF) in place of the DPT. All M.D. -Ph.D. students use the DPF in lieu of the DPT. 17 Minimum Grade Requirements Students are expected to maintain a grade point average of 3.0 in didactic course work. Students whose performance falls below this standard in a given quarter will be placed on academic probation, as described in the Deficiencies and Unsatisfactory Progre ss Policy and Warning, Probation , Dismissal and Appeal Policy found on the MCGSBS Policies and Procedures intranet site. Transfer Credits A total of 21 credits may be tran sferred into the Ph.D. Program. For more details, see the Credit Transfer Polic y on the MCGSBS Policies and Procedures intranet site . Qualifying Examinations The qualifying examinations are intended to test the student's fund of information in the sciences related to the chosen field of study and to evaluate the student's ability to reason critically. Written Qualifying Examination The written qualifying examination will test the breadth of biomedical knowledge, and analytic and critical reasoning skills. The content and format of the examination is determined by each track. The written qualifying examination may be taken no more than twice. If it is not passed on the first attempt , the exam must be retaken by the end of the quarter following the quarter in which the exam was first taken. Failing the examination once will result in the student being placed on academic probation. Failing the examination twice will result in dismissal. The written qualifying examination must be completed by timeline defined by track, but at latest before September 30 of the third year for Ph.D. students , and before September 30 of the second year for M.D.- Ph.D. students. MCGSBS must be informed of the exam date three weeks in advance so that the Ph.D. Written Qualifying Examination Report form can be sent to the exam chair. For more details, see the Written Qualifying Exam Procedure on the MCGSBS Policies and Procedures intranet site . Oral Qualifying Examination Oral qualifying exam committee composition is determined collaboratively between student and student's mentor and requires approval of the program director and the school . Selection timeline varies by track, but at very latest must be before September 30 of the third year for Ph.D. students, and before September 30 of the second year for M.D -Ph.D. students. All members must have graduate faculty privileges. The oral qualifying exam committee must consist of a minimum of four members a nd membership must include: OQE Chair Mentor A minimum of three members must have Full Faculty Privileges (FF). A minimum of two members must be designated Experienced Examiners , in any track . Note: Tracks may have more specific requirements For more det ails, see the Oral Qualifying Exam Committee Selection and Procedure on the MCGSBS Policies and Procedures intranet site . When MCGSBS is notified that the written qualifying examination has been passed, the oral qualifying examination may be taken. MCGSBS must be informed of the date of the examination three weeks in advance so that the Ph.D. Oral Qualifying Examination Report form can be sent to the oral qualifying examination committee chair. The oral qualifying examination timeline varies by track, but at lates t must be completed before December 31 of the third year for Ph.D. students, and before December 31 of the second year for M.D .-Ph.D. students. All approved committee members must be present at the exam. Any 18 absent me mber is considered a dissenting vote. Only one dissenting vote will be allowed for a \"Pass\" or \"Conditional Pass.\" In the event of a Conditional Pass, the specific requirements that must be satisfied by the student must be listed on the back of the Ph.D. Oral Qualifying Examination Report form. The oral qualifying examination may be taken no more than twice. If it is not passed on the first attempt, the exam must be retaken by the end of the quarter following the quarter in which the exam was first taken. Failing the examination once will result in the student being placed on academic probation. Failing the examination twice will result in dismissal. Thesis Thesis Advisory Committee Ph.D. candidates are expected to submit to the MCGSBS office the composition of their Thesis Advisory Committee (TAC) within 90 days of selecting a mentor . The TAC composition is determined collaboratively between student and student's mentor and requires approval of the program director and the school . All members must have graduate faculty privileges. The TAC must consist of five members and membership must include: TAC Chair Mentor Three faculty members must have Full Faculty Privileges (FF), including the C hair. A minimum of two members must be Experienced Examiners , of any track . Two faculty members must have mentored a student to Ph.D. degree. The committee for M.D.- Ph.D. students must include a member of the M.D.- Ph.D. Executive Committee either as a voting member or ex -officio. The student may consider having the mentor and TAC Chair be separate to avoid potential conflict of interest. This is recommended by the graduate school, but not required. Note: Tracks may have more specific requirements . For more details , see the Thesis Advisory Committee Meeting Selection and Documentation Procedure on the MCGSBS Policies and Procedures intranet site . Thesis Proposal A written thesis proposal, presentation and thesis committee discussion of the proposal must be completed by December 31 of the student's third year for Ph.D. students, depending on track, and by December 31 of the second year for M.D.- Ph.D. students. This requirement may be accomplished during the oral qualifying examination or at a separate committee meeting for this purpose. The TAC must be approved prior to this committee discussion. The Mayo Institutional Review Board must review all protocols for res earch involving the use of human subjects. It is the candidate's responsibility to secure approval of any such protocols before the research is undertaken. Preparation of thesis The thesis is the most important document that the Ph.D. candidate will prepare during the course of graduate study and is a record of the scientific accomplishments that justify the awarding of the degree. The thesis is archival. Consequently, MCGSBS has developed standards for its format and style, which should be closely followed. MCGSBS Thesis Guidelines for Ph.D. thesis are available on the MCGSBS intranet site under For Students/ General Forms /Resources . The student's mentor must sign a form 19 indicating that he/she has read the thesis and that it is ready for defense prior to distribution t o the thesis advisory committee members. The Verification Thesis Ready to Defend form can be accessed on the MCGSBS intranet site under For Students/ General Forms /Resources . The thesis must be submitted to the TAC at least three weeks prior to the final oral examination. Students enrolled in the M.D. -Ph.D. program must submit their final thesis to their TAC and the Veri fication of Thesis Cor rections Form must be signed and submitted to the MCGSBS office before they can resume studies in Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine (MC ASOM) . Student Progress Students must have meetings every six months with their TAC. Students are expected to register each quarter and will be contacted if they have not registered. To remain in good standing, compliance with all requirements is expected. Continuation of stipen d depends u pon remaining in good standing. Fellowship Award Submission Students must submit an application for extramural fellowship award or equivalent during their training. All Ph.D. students must submit a fellowship application, preferably during their 2nd year of study but by end of 3rd year. (Applies to students who matriculated in 2020 or after.) Alternatives for international students are explained in the Academic Success and Graduation Requirements Policy. All M.D. -Ph.D. students must submit an NIH F30 fellowship application (or equivalent) by the end of their 2nd PhD year. Students unable to identify an external organization to apply for a fellowship award must submit an F31 grant application template internally to the graduate school to meet th is graduation requirement. For more details , see the Fellowship Application and Award Policy on the MCGSBS Policies and Procedures intranet site. Publication Requirement Ph.D. thesis research must make a substantial contribution to the biomedical literature and preparing work for publication is an important part of research training. The expectation is that student thesis research will result in multiple publications, with the requirement for graduation of a minimum of one peer- reviewed first-autho red original paper accepted for publication. Students are required to indicate in publications their affiliation with and support from MCGSBS . Exceptions to the publication requirement must be submitted as a recommendation from the TAC with endorsement from the program director, and approval by the MCGSBS Education Committee. For more details , see the Publication Requirement Policy and Publication Exception Request Procedure on the MCGSBS Policies and Procedures intranet site. Final Oral Examination The final oral examination will be scheduled after 1) the written qualifying and oral qualifying examinations have been passed, and 2) all course and non- course requirements have been met. , MCGSBS must be informed of the date of the examination three weeks in advance so that the Ph.D. Final Oral Examination Report form can be sent to the T AC Chair. The exam will be open to the Mayo public. Members of the TAC should receive copies of the thesis at least three weeks prior to the final o ral examination. The Chair must be present at the defense as a real time participant. Additional, v oting members of the TAC must be present in real time via physical presence or video - or teleconferencing at the final oral examination. Only one dissentin g vote will be allowed for a \"Pass.\" Any absent voting member is considered a \"Fail\" vote. Passage of the final oral examination requires a minimum of four passing votes, otherwise a determination of \"Fail\" must be made. Thus, no more th an one TAC member m ay be absent 20 for the final oral examination. The final oral examination may be taken no more than once. Failing the examination will result in dismissal. PhD appointments in MCGSBS will continue no more than 30 days beyond a successful thesis defense date. For more details , see the Final Oral Examination -Thesis Defense Procedure on the MCGSBS Policies and Procedures intranet site. Final Thesis Corrections After the student has passed the final oral examination, the student has no more than 30 days to complete all degree requirements. The chair of the TAC must sign a form indicating he/she is satisfied that the final corrections to the thesis have been made and before the student will be cleared for graduation. MCGSBS will not certify completion of degree requirements until the final thesis has been submitted . This requirement is satisfied by uploading the final thesis into ProQuest for publication with the option of adding a publication hold if needed . If a student does not wish to have their thesis published, they must submit a PDF version of the final thesis to the graduate school by their student end date. Graduation Students are granted degrees four times a year (3rd Friday except in May it is the date of commencement) : February, May, August, and November. The May date involves a formal ceremony as part of the Mayo Clinic graduation exercises in conjunction with MCASOM . No ceremony is held in February , August, and November, but students who graduate at one of these times are encouraged to participate in the May ceremony. Students are allowed no more than 30 days to complete Ph.D. degree requirements after a successful thesis de fense Students should a lso keep in mind that Ph.D. appointments in MCGSBS will continue no more than 30 days beyond a successful thesis defense when scheduling the thesis defense. If a student does not meet the thesis deadline, they will be required to re- defend their thesis. For degree conferral in: Defend by: All Post -Defense Requirements completed by: February January 1 February 1 May April 1 May 1 August July 1 August 1 November October 1 November 1 21 M.D. - Ph.D. Program The M.D.- Ph.D. program is a highly competitive program for students with exceptional academic records and previous research experience. Both the M.D. and Ph.D. degrees may be earned in an integrated seven -to eight -year program. Students follow the Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine (MC ASOM) curriculum for two years. Step 1 of the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) must be taken by the end of the second year and a passing score must be documented before entry into the Ph.D. phase of the dual degree. Students then begin Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences (MCGSBS) training. The advanced course work in the track and the thesis research are undertak en and usually completed in the next three to four years. During the final two years, students complete the MCASOM curriculum . The elements of the Ph.D. training for students enrolled in the M.D.- Ph.D. program are generally the same as those for non- M.D. -Ph.D. candidates, except for laboratory rotations. M.D.- Ph.D. students are required to take the following courses: Core Courses CORE 6000 Responsible Conduct of Research CORE 6100 Chemical Principles of Biological Systems (all tracks except BMEP) CORE 6150 Genome Biology CORE 6300 Molecular Biophysics (required for BMEP) MGS 5000 Fundamental Skills (required starting with 2021 G1s ) Intermediate and A dvanced Quantitative Biology Courses - 2 courses required ( not required for BMEP) BMB 6100 Macromolecular Structure and Dynamics BMEP 6350 Advanced Concepts in Molecular Biophysics CORE 6300 Molecular Biophysics CORE 6450 Molecular Pharmacology and Receptor Signaling CTSC 5400 Introduction to Bioinformatics Conc epts and Core Technologies for Individualized Medicine Approaches CTSC 5600 Statistics in Clinical and Translational Research CTSC 5602 Utilizing Statics in Clinic Research CTSC Methods II CTSC 5650 CTSC 6160 Genomic Data Interpretation for Rare & Undiagnosed Diseases MPET 6450 Applied Data Science and Artificial Intelligence 6813 Tutorial in for MD -PhD Students MDPH 5200 Critical Reading Skills for MD- PhD Students Weekly M.D. -Ph.D. C onference - Required to register each year during the Ph.D. phase of the program: MDPH 5300 Weekly MD -PhD Conference Submission of a fellowship application . All M.D. -Ph.D. students will work with their Mentor s to prepare and submit an application for an F30 or equivalent fellowship before their 48th month in the program. Submission of a fellows hip application is a program requirement . 22 Clinical Experience Elective Course. For MD -PhD students in the research years to maintain focused clinical training after having taken CLNX 7640 (MD -PhD Clinical Experience) for credit through MCASOM. MDPH 6100 MD-PhD Clinical Experience Senior Post Graduate MD -PhD Research Experience. For students who have completed all PhD requirements, completed all required medical school courses and electives and would like to return to the laboratory to work on a new project with a new laboratory mentor or complete a promising project that was starte d with their original mentor. MDPH 6200 Senior Post Graduate MD/PhD Research Experience Track R equirements M.D. - Ph.D. students must complete all track- required courses, journal clubs and seminars; however, there are exceptions allowed for t rack electives and MCGSBS laboratory rotations. As a result of these exceptions, M.D.- Ph.D. students are allowed to take less than the standard 66 credits. Track electives are fulfilled by preclerkship medical school coursework. Laboratory rotations are s atisfied by completing 2 or 3 one -month, full -time rotations. It is recommended that one rotation be completed before entering medical school, the second between during the preclerkship curriculum , and the third (optional) between medical school and gradua te school ( before or after taking USMLE Step 1).

Directed research projects under the supervision of a faculty mentor . Lab Selection, Qualifying Exams and Thesis Research Students are expected to complete their rotations and select the laboratory for their thesis studies within six months of joining the program. 24 Written Qualifying Exam Written qualifying exam: Students take the written qualifying exam at the end of the first year. The exam is a one -day exam held at the beginning of July. The exam consists of demonstrating critical evaluation and understanding of two published primary res earch papers relevant to the broad field of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology as covered in the core courses CORE 6100, CORE 6150 and CORE 6250 as well as the elective courses, CORE 6400 and BMB 5000. Three sets of papers reflecting the three areas of emp hasis of the track: BSB, CBG and CB, will be made available to the students three days before the exam . On the day of the exam, students are required to answer a series of specific questions associated with any two of the six papers . The questions will cov er foundation of knowledge in addition to synthesis of concepts. The exam is prepared and graded by the faculty and a n overall grade of 70% is required for successful completion of the exam. Oral Qualifying Exam Students are expected to take the oral qual ifying exam by the end of the ir second year. This exam includes a thesis proposal and it is presumed that preliminary data in support of the project will be in hand. Concerns pertaining to the timing of this exam should be directed to BMB Track leadership. Before taking the exam, the student must prepare a final version of their thesis proposal and circulate it to their thesis committee at least two weeks before the examination. The thesis proposal serves as a springboard for faculty to probe the student's background knowledge, ability to propose and defend hypotheses, and design experiments to test these hypotheses. The oral qualifying exam committee must conform to MCGSBS requirements and be approved by the p rogram director. Thesis Proposal The written t hesis proposal matches the format of NIH F31 grants and, hence, is limited to 8 pages, including illustrations but not including references. In the student's own words, the proposal should outline the rationale for the proposed project and how it is to be executed. The proposal is subdivided into the following sections. 1) Abstract: Summary of your project (30 lines of text limit) 2) Specific Aims page: Describe briefly the aims of your project and hypotheses (1 page limit). 3) Research Strategy (6 page limit) Significance: Put your project into context with what is known about this area of biology and show the importance of the questions you are asking ( 1-1.5 pages). Innovation: How is the project you are proposing novel and groundbreaking ( 0.5-1 page). Approac h: Describe what you plan to do and how you plan to do it. Include preliminary data for each aim that sets the scene and supports your hypotheses ( 3.5-4.5 pages). Reflecting the importance the track puts on the quality of this document and the role it p lays in planning your thesis studies, 2 credits are given for preparing and defending the proposal (Registration in BMB , 6900) . All students are expected to submit an F31 or equivalent grant to the NIH or any other funding agency that they are eligible for . Any student unable to identify a mechanism for which they are eligible must submit the grant to the graduate school. 25 Biomedical Engineering and Physiology (BMEP) - Ph.D. Degree Kristin D.

This occurs largely as a result of lab rotations. By the beginning of the second year all students should select an area of emphasis. Students may combine areas. At the beginning of the second year, all students must take and satisfactorily pass a comprehensive qualifying exam, consisting of both written and oral components. The written qualifying exam focuses on required core curriculum courses tak en in the first year and tests the conceptual integration of material in these courses. The oral qualifying exam will include a presentation of proposed research and tests the synthesis of course work and research interests. During the second year of the pro gram it is expected that all students will have selected thesis mentor and a Th esis Ad visory Commi ttee with approval of the Biomedical Engineering & Physiology Edu cation Commi ttee. Students must have their first thesis committee meeting by March of their 3rd year. Each student is expected to meet with their TAC at least twice a year to discuss progress towards their dissertation research. The TAC will decide when the research has progressed sufficiently so that a dissertation can be written, and the student will then write their dissertation and publicly defend it. 28 Clinical and Translational Science (CTS) - Ph.D. Degree Felicity T.

In addition to the core and track requirements, courses should be selected after consultation between the student, their mentor , and the p rogram director/ associate program director. Depending on the student's area of c oncentration (laboratory, patient or population- based translational science) additional advanced courses will be selected from either CTSC track courses or MCGSBS core courses in the basic science disciplines. Qualifying Exams and Thesis Research Written Qualifying Examination (WQE) The written qualifying examination tests your breadth of biomedical knowledge, as well as your analytical and critical reasoning skills. This examination must be completed before the end of your second year in the program. The CTS predoctoral programs education coordinator will assist you with the examination timeline . The purpose of the Written Qualifying Examination (WQE) is to evaluate student's PhD thesis project. The examination will be in the format of a project proposal pulling components from the NIH F30 grant for dual degree candidates (MD/PhDs), the F31 grant for doctoral trainees (PhDs), other equivalent grant appropriate upon approval. In general, the proposal -based examination consists of documents that demonstrate the following: The ability to identify a substantive proposal topic The ability to formulate valid and testable hypotheses The ability to identify the importance of an d justification for the proposed research, by preparing a comprehensive review of related research literature and presenting the proposed project in that context The ability to prepare a sound research plan that includes both appropriate techniques and approaches suitable for the testing of the hypotheses and alternative strategies and hypotheses The ability to articulate an understanding of clinical and translational science and team science as it relates to proposed research These courses must be com pleted before you take the exam: CORE 6000 R esponsible Conduct of Research CORE 6050 Critical Thinking and Writing CORE 6051 Scientific Writing Part II CORE 6100 Chemical Principles of Biological Systems CORE 6150 Genome Biology CTSC 5020 Regulatory Issues in Clinical Research CTSC 5370 Introduction to Epidemiology CTSC 5600 Introduction to Statistics in Clinical and Translational CTSC 560 2 Introduction to Utilizing Statistical Software in Clinical and Translational Research 30 Oral Qualifying Examination (OQE) For the oral qualifying examination, students submit a written thesis proposal and defend their thesis research proposal to the Oral Qualifying Exam Committee. The proposal should summarize the goals, methods, and rational e for the research project. The specific guidelines for the form of this proposal are available from the CTS predoctoral education coordinator. This proposal must be submitted to the oral qualifying exam committee at least one week prior to the examinatio n. The oral examination is composed of two or three parts. The first part will be an oral presentation by the student of their proposal; the second part will be a discussion between the student and the committee about this proposal. If there were any co nditional elements or weaknesses identified at the time of the written qualifying exam, the committee may then add a third part to the examination which will include a wide -ranging discussion of either the area of deficiency or course work material covered by the student during the first two years. Students will be notified after their written qualifying examination whether this third component should be expected during the oral qualifying exam. Pre-Thesis Advisory Committee (Pre -TAC) CTS students are strongly advised to form a pre -TAC by the end of their first year after their mentor selection to support their experiential training. This will prepare students for the formation of their formal TAC. The pre- TAC will help the student and mentor identify key team members for an official TAC and formulate specific aims that will form the basis of the student's thesis proposal moving forward. Thesis Advisory Committee The student, their thesis mentor and the CTS predoctoral program director/associate director will establish a formal TAC to monitor the student's thesis research progress. This should be established no later than the beginning of the student's second year. The student's adviser is chair of the committee. Students are required to meet with their t hesis advisory committee at least once every six months. At the meetings, the student will present progress on his, her, or their thesis project. The committee will offer advice, and an evaluation of the student's progress will be discussed with the studen t at the end of the meeting. Thesis proposal Students must complete a written thesis proposal, presentation and thesis committee discussion of their proposal. This requirement may be accomplished during the oral qualifying examination or at a separate com mittee meeting for this purpose. The student's TAC must be approved prior to this committee discussion. Publication requirement Ph.D. thesis research must make a substantial contribution to the biomedical literature, and preparing work for publication is a n important part of research training. The expectation is that thesis research will result in multiple publications. To graduate, students need to publish at least one original peer -reviewed paper on which they are first author. 31 Immunology (IMM) - Ph.D. Degree Kay L.

MD -PhD students are only required to take 4 elective credits from upper- level courses; these are often MD -PhD program required courses. Any group of courses offered by MCGSBS can be used to fulfill this requirement; however, students are expected to choose courses that complement their thesis work and careers. Also, the plans for elective coursework must be approved by the IMM graduate program director. In addition , before completion of the program, all students are encouraged to attend the one week long summer course in advanced immunology sponsored by the American Association of Immunologists. Research (minimum 24 credits required) MGS 6890 Predoctoral Research (3 cr./qtr x minimum 8 terms) Must enroll every quarter once a thesis laboratory is selected for remainder of program. Directed research projects under the supervision of a faculty mentor . Qualifying Exams and Thesis Research By the end of the first year of the program, each student is expected to select a laboratory and thesis mentor . At the beginning of the second year, all students take a written and oral qualifying exam. The written exam precedes the oral exam and is administered over two consecutive half -day sessions. This exam covers fundamental Immunology, including the material taught in the core Immunology course and the six required Immunology tutorials. The exam is prepared and graded by the faculty responsible for teaching the courses. All student are strongly encouraged to schedule and take the IMM oral qualifying exam 8 weeks after the written qualifying exam. All students must take and satisfactorily pass the oral qualifying exam no later than October 31 of the third year. Immunology T rack stude nts are required to have five faculty members on their exam committee, the composition of which will be determined by the Immunology P rogram Director with input from the student and the mentor . The student and mentor may choose two examiners , and the Immunology Program Director, drawing from a designated pool of examiners, will choose the remaining three. A written thesis proposal, presentation, and Thesis Advisory Committee (TAC) discussion of the proposal must be c ompleted by the middle of the student's third year. Immunology T rack degree candidates, however, are strongly encouraged to complete this requirement within two months of successfully passing the oral qualifying exam. The student should work with the lab m entor to prepare a 6-7 page written thesis prop osal (single -spaced, \u00bd inch margins on all sides, Arial 11 font; references are required but are not included in the 6 -7 page limit) in the format of an F31/F30 NIH fellowship grant. Students who have taken CORE6050 are taught how to write such a document during the course. All students are expected to prepare the thesis proposal by working closely with their lab mentor. The composition of the TAC will be determined by the m entor with input from the student and must be approved by the Immunology P rogram Director and MCGSBS . The TAC must consist of a minimum of five faculty members; three members must have full privileges. 33 Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics (MPET) - Ph.D. Degree Martin E.

M.D.- Ph.D. students must take the written qualifying exam before December 31 of the second year. The written exam covers the fun damentals of pharmacology, including the material covered in all of the required MPET track required courses including , (MPET 6450), Applied Data Science and Artificial Intelligence in or ( MPET 6813 ), Tutorial in Systems Pharmacology. In addition, each student is asked to write an \"NIH -style grant\" based on data in a recent research article in one of the fields of molecular pharmacology. The exam is prepared and graded by the faculty. Oral qualifying exam: The oral qualifying exam must be taken by December 31 of the student's third year. In this exam, students orally present a preliminary thesis proposal, whic h serves as a springboard for faculty to probe the student's background knowledge, ability to propose hypotheses, and design experiments to test hypotheses. The oral qualifying exam committee must conform to the MCGSBS requirements and be approved by the p rogram director. Thesis proposal: A written thesis proposal in the format of an NIH R01 grant must be presented to your Thesis Advisory Committee within two months of completing the oral qualifying exam. The proposal should be divided into the following sections: Abstract: Summary of your project. Specific Aims: Describe briefly the aims of your project and hypotheses. Significance and Innovation: Put your project into context with what is known about this area of biology and show the importance of the q uestions you are asking. Approach: A. Background and Preliminary Data: Describe the results you (and others) have obtained, in your host laboratory (and in collaboration), that set the scene for your proposal and supports your hypotheses. B. Rationale: Here, you summarize AGAIN your key background and preliminary data , facts and say why they support your hypothesis and approach. Explain why in general you chose your particular specific aims/experiments/approach to test your hypothesis. C. Research Plan: Describe what you plan to do and how you plan to do it. Break this down by specific aims. Include expected outcomes and potential pitfalls for each aim. 35 Neuro science (NSC) - Ph.D. Degree Owen A.

Directed research projects under the supervision of a faculty mentor . Sixty- six credits are required for graduation. In addition to the core and track requirements, additional course s should be selected after consultation between the student and their mentor . Any courses offered by the MCGSBS may be taken for elective credit. Thesis Mentor Ideally, you will have identified a thesis mentor by the end of your third rotation. However, additional rotations can be performed if necessary. If you have not identified a thesis mentor after three rotations, you should meet with the program director to discuss any problems/concerns you may have experienced during your rotations and to discuss the identification of another rotation. If you are unable to choose a mentor after 5 rotations you must resign from the program. Thesis Advisory Committee You s hould form your thesis advisory committee within 90 days of selecting your mentor and joining their lab. This committee has a minimum of 5 members who should be identified with the help of your thesis mentor . The committee composition must be approved by the program director. In consultation with your mentor you should select one committee member other than your mentor to serve as the chair of this committee and they must, therefore, have full graduate faculty privileges. Overall, three of the committee me mbers must have full graduate privileges, two of the members must have successfully mentored a student to degree, and two members must be from your degree track. This committee is intended to help you become a successful scientist - as such, and due to the natural evolution of Ph.D. research projects, the committee composition may change over time. Any changes should be discussed thoroughly with your thesis mentor and approved by the program director. Appropriate paperwork for the committee roster must be filed within 90 days of selecting your thesis mentor. First TAC Meeting: Your first TAC meeting should occur within 90 days of selecting your thesis lab. At this meeting you will introduce your committee to your proposed thesis project area and should inc lude the hypothesis, specific aims, and experimental objectives that you intend to accomplish during your Ph.D. research. Your committee will discuss your intentions and determine whether they represent an appropriate starting point for your thesis researc h. The initial thesis proposal is not a contract between you and the committee - all Ph.D. projects evolve in response to actual experimentation and your final thesis research may differ substantially from your original proposal. Likewise, your committee m ay modify their expectations and requirements throughout the course of your thesis research. An important aspect of successful Ph.D. training is constant communication with your thesis committee. Qualifying Exams and Thesis Research Written Qualifying Exam Neuroscience students will meet the requirement of the written qualifying exam by preparing a submission -ready pre- doctoral grant application (F31 or equivalent) by the end of fall quarter, year 2. Students will receive ample instruction in to the format and expected content of the proposal during CORE6050/6051 the scientific writing courses. All pre -doctoral grants will be reviewed by faculty for quality before a passing grade is conferred. Completion of an acceptable pre- doctoral grant will constitute a passing grade on the written qualifying exam. All students are required to submit the application to a funding agency during the following calendar year (January- December/Yr2 -3). 37 Oral Qualifying Exam The oral qualifying exam is a critical step on the road to acquiring the Ph.D. You are strongly encouraged to discuss the oral exam with the program director or educational coordinator well in advance of the end of your 6th quarter. Timing: The graduate s chool formally allows students to delay their oral exam until the end of the 2nd year. While this remains an option, Oral qualifying exams should be scheduled no earlier than the 5th quarter, but before the end of your 8th quarter (basically towards the end of your second year). Students will disseminate their Thesis Proposal (F31 or equivalent grant application prepared for the written qualifying exam) to members of their oral exam committee at least 3 weeks before the exa m. This document will be used as the basis for your oral exam. Paperwork must be submitted with the graduate school at least three weeks before the scheduled exam. Committee Composition: The oral exam committee usually mirrors your TAC and includes a mini mum of 4 members chosen for their expertise in the general area of research relevant to the student's proposal. The oral exam committee will always include two designated examiners, one of whom should be a member of the NSC Education Committee in order to ensure that all candidates meet a standard level of general background knowledge and to ensure that each candidate is tested fairly on the basis of their readiness for advancement to candidacy, rather than upon the quality of their preliminary data, the na ture of their research project, or the influence of their faculty mentor. All members must be approved by the program director and site -specific associate director and should be selected after extensive discussion between the student and their faculty mentor. Exam Format: The exam will be driven by a well- written, in -depth F31 -like proposal focused upon the student's general research area. The oral exam will emphasize general neuroscience knowledge, the ability to generate hypotheses, the ability to \"think on your feet\", and the ability to diagram and explain scientific concepts (a \"chalk talk\" format). The exam will also probe the depth of knowledge specific to the proposed area of research. Ultimately, any aspect of scientific thinking and general scientific knowledge is fair game, but the intention of this exam is not to trick or confuse but rather to provide a fair and supportive environment in which each student can prove their readiness for advancement to candidacy. Fellowships All eligible students are required to apply for pre -doctoral funding via the National Research Service Award (NRSA) mechanism (F31) or equivalent . The written qualifying exam and thesis proposal format is intended to assist in the preparation of a competitive NRSA application. Fur ther information is available at http://grants.nih.gov/training/nrsa.htm or the Publication Requirement Policy. Lab Changes Changes in thesis mentor are strongly discouraged after the 6th quarter. If changes are requested after this time they will be approved at the discretion of the p rogram director and School . 38 Regenerative Degree Isobel Ph.D ., Program Director Quinn P.

This examination must be completed before the end of your second year in the program. The REGS Education Coordinat or will assist you in ensuring completion of this exam on schedule . For the WQE, students will develop a research question and prepare a submission -ready pre- doctoral grant application (F31 or equivalent). The pre -doctoral grant will be reviewed by faculty and a passing grade granted for completion of the WQE. The grant proposal will be evaluated to determine the 40 student's understanding of the field of regenerative sciences, ability to establish a research plan to address the proposed question and ability f or independent thought. The following courses must be completed before you take the exam : CORE 6100 Chemical Principles of Biological Systems CORE 6150 Genome Biology CORE 6250 Molecular Cell Biology REGS 5300 Stem Cell and 6400 Regenerative Medicine Principles to Practice* *Courses must be completed or students must be concurrently enrolled at the time of the exam. Oral Qualifying Examination (OQE) For the oral qualifying examination, students will be evaluated on their theoretical and practical knowledge in the regenerative sciences. Students will defend their thesis research proposal to the Oral Qual ifying Exam Committee. The proposal should summarize the goals, methods, and rationale for the research project. This examination must be completed before the end of your second year in the program. The guidelines for this oral presentation are available from the REGS Education Coordinator. The oral examination is composed of two or three parts. The first part will be an oral presentation by the student of their proposal; the second part will be a discussion between the student and the committee about this proposal. If there were any conditional elements or weaknesses identified at the time of the written qualifying exam, the committee may then add a third part to the oral examination which will include a wide - ranging discussion of either the area of deficiency or course work material covered by the student during the first two years. Students will be notified after their written qualifying examination whether t his third component should be expected during the oral qualifying exam. Formation of Thesis Advisory Committee (TAC) REGS students are strongly advised to form a TAC by the end of their first year and within 90 days of mentor selection to support their experiential training. TAC formation at this early stage will help the student and mentor chart progress through coursework, qualifying exams , and project development. TAC members may change during PhD studies. Early TAC formation should be viewed a s a starting point to aid the student in formulat ing specific aims that will form the basis of the thesis proposal. Including a TAC member external to Mayo Clinic is encouraged, but not required..

Mentor A Master's degree mentor must have MCGSBS full or Master's graduate faculty privileges. A list of Faculty with Privileges can be found on the MCGSBS intranet site. Official Degree Planning Tool The use of a Degree Planning Tool (DPT) is required and allows students to list the course work to fulfill degree requirements, including transfer credits. Fifty percent of the credits counting toward degree must be graded on the A -F grading system. The D PT should be completed during the first academic year and should be updated as courses are completed throughout the training program. A final completed DPT must be reviewed with the student's mentor before finalizing a defense date, and submitted to the school when a defense date has been determined (ideally 8 weeks prior to defense) . The DPT is available on the MCGSBS intranet site under For Students/General Forms/Resources/Master's Forms . Minimum Grade Requirements Students are expected to maintain a grade point average of 3.0 in didactic course work. Students whose performance falls below this standard in a given quarter will be placed on academic probation, as described in the Deficiencies and Unsatisfactory Progress Policy and Warning, Probation, Dismissal and Appeal Policy outlined on the MCGSBS Policies and Procedures intranet site. Examinations Written Examination A comprehensive written examination must be taken before completion of the training program. The written examination may be taken no more than twice. Failing the examination twice will result in dismissal. The written examination must be passed before the final oral examination may be scheduled. Final Oral Ex amination Candidates for the Master's degree are expected to pass the final oral examination before completion of the Mayo residency or fellowship training program. The final oral examination may be taken after: 1) the written examination has been passed, 2) all course w ork has been completed, and 3) the thesis is reviewed and deemed ready to defend. 45 Voting members of the Thesis Advisory Committee must be present in real time via physical presence or video - or teleconferencing at the final oral examination. Only one dissenting vote will be allowed for a \"Pass.\" Passage of the final oral examination req uires a minimum of three passing votes; otherwise a determination of \"Fail\" must be made. Thus, no more than one Thesis Advisory Committee member may be absent for the final oral examination. The final oral examination may be taken no more than twice. If i t is not passed on the first attempt, it must be retaken by the end of the quarter following the quarter in which the exam was first taken. Failing the examination twice will result in dismissal. Thesis Research Proposal: The research proposal must cle arly define the candidate's role in the project and must have sufficient detail to permit review by an advisory committee. Additional details on the research proposal can be found on the Master's Forms web page . Thesis Advisory Committee : After approval by the track , students submit the Master's Thesis Advisory Committee E-Form rec ommending the members of their Thesis Advisory Committee (TAC ). All members must have graduate faculty privileges and the chair must have a minimum of Master's graduate faculty privileges. The TAC must consist of : o Four members, including the student's mentor o Mentor serves as the chair of the TAC o Any additional memb ers beyond four will be designated as ex -officio and will not vote at the final defense. o No more than two members may have Teaching/Examining Privileges (TE). Some tracks may define more specific criteria. Progress Meetings: The Master's Thesis Advisory Committee must meet at minimum every six months from the date of committee approval. Doc umentation of student progress using a progress meeting report form , must be signed by all members of the Thesis Advisory Committee, and saved within the program. Th e report form templates can be found on the Master's Forms web page . Preparation of Thesis: The thesis is the most important document that the Master's candidate will prepare during the course of graduate study and is a record of the scientific accomplishments that justify the awarding of the degree. The thesis is submitted to ProQuest. Consequently, MCGSBS has developed a standard for its format and style, which should be closely followed. Guidelines for Master's thesis are available on the MCGSBS intranet site under For Students/ General Forms/Resources. Final Thesis Corrections: After the student has passed the final oral examination, the chair of the Thesis Advisory Committee must sign a form indicating he/she is satisfied that the final correctio ns to the thesis have been made. The chair must sign before the student will be cleared for graduation. MCGSBS will not certify completion of degree requirements until the final thesis has been submitted. Graduation Students are granted degrees four times a year (3rd Friday except in May it is the date of commencement) : February, May, August, and November.

Formation of Thesis Advisory Committee (TAC) Master's students are strongly advised to form a TAC within 6 0 days of mentor selection to support their experiential training. TAC formation at this early stage will help the student and mentor chart progress through coursework, qualifying exam and project development. TAC members may change over the course of master's stud ies and this early TAC formation should be viewed as a starting point to aid the student to formulate specific aims that will form the basis of the student's thesis proposal moving forward. The student, their thesis mentor and the REGS master's program director/associate director will establish a formal TAC to monitor the student's thesis research progress. This should be established no later than 90 days from the beginning of the student's program start . The student's mentor is chair of the com mittee. Thesis Advisory Committee Meetings Students are required to meet with their thesis advisory committee at least once every three months. At the meetings, the student will present progress on his, her, or their thesis project. The committee will off er advice, and an evaluation of the student's progress will be discussed with the student at the end of the meeting. Thesis Proposal Students must complete a written thesis proposal, presentation and thesis committee discussion of their proposal. This req uirement may be accomplished during the written qualifying examination or at the first thesis committee meeting. The student's TAC must be approved prior to this committee discussion. Thesis Defense (Final Oral Examination) The final oral examination cannot be completed until the following criteria have been met: The Written Qualifying Examination has been passed, All coursework has been completed with a GPA of 3.0 or higher, All program milestones have been met, and REGS master's program director/asso ciate director have reviewed and approved the thesis proposal Publication Requirement Master's thesis research must make a substantial contribution to the biomedical literature and preparing work for publication is an important part of research training. The expectation is that thesis research will result in publication . To graduate, students need to publish one or two original peer -reviewed papers on which they are first author. 57 Virology and Gene Therapy (VGT) - Postdoctoral Master's Degr ee Michael A. Barry, Ph.D., Program Director Autumn J. Schulze, Ph.D., Associate Program Director Postdoctoral Basic Science Master's Degree - 45 credits required over 2 years The Postdoctoral Master's degree track in Virology and Gene Therapy has two pathways to choose from: The REGULATORY/TRANSLATIONAL PATHWAY student will gain a broad scope of gene therapy and will learn how to develop a gene based therapeutic from an idea to a validated product. Various gene therapy strategies will be considered in relation to a broad spectrum of human diseases illustrating ho w genes can be used for gene replacement, tissue engineering, destruction of unwanted tissues, or immune stimulation. Stages in the development of gene -based drugs & biologics will be studied from vector design through preclinical proof of efficacy, clinic al protocol development, product manufacture, pharmacology and toxicology testing, analysis of clinical trial outcomes, regulatory affairs, patenting and partnering with industry. The Regulatory/Translation pathway is designed for those learners who desire to conduct or participate in research that will identify therapies/devices that will move into manufacturing facilities. The RESEARCH PATHWAY student will learn from and work alongside faculty members who have primary interests in virology, viral vectors and gene therapy and will develop research skills in conducting and participating in vaccine and gene therapy discovery. These areas overlap with the fields of biochemistry, cell and molecular biology, genetics, and immunology and regulatory science. The Research pathway is designed for learners who desire to be an informed member of a research team conducting or participating in Virology and Gene Therapy research.

A form signed by the track program director will be submitted to MCGSBS upon successful completion of the written qualifying exam. Advisory Committee In consultation with the program director, the student will select a Master's project mentor within the first year of the program. The mentor must have MCGSBS faculty privileges and must not be the employee's direct supervisor. In consultation with the program director and the Master's project mentor , the student will select an Employee Master's Advisory Committee comprised of four faculty members. This committee must include, at a minimum, either the track program director or the associate program directors. This committee should meet yearly to assess the student's progress and to provide guidance regarding the Master's scholarly review article (f inal project). A form indicating the composition of the committee must be submitted to MCGSBS . Master's Scholarly Review Article (Final Project) The project forms the central element of the Master's degree. The student should enroll in MGS 6400, Master's Scholarly Review Article (Final Project) during the final quarter of tenure in the program in order to finalize the scholarly review article (final project). In general, the project will take the form of a substantial and scholarly review of the current field related to a specific topic of interest to the student. While the final form of the scholarly review article (final project) is at the discretion of the Employee Master's Advisory Committee, a 50 -100 page, double -spaced document comprised of text, figures, and tables as appropriate, is recommended. This document must be written in close consultation with the Master's project mentor and must be submitted to the Employee Master's Advisory Committee for review at least one month prior to the final scholarly review article (final project) defense date. Upon successful completion of the defense and careful editing of the document, the track will pay to have 3 copies bound (one for the Master's project mentor , one for the track, and one for the student). Binding should be coordinated with the program director or associate program directors. The scholarly review article (final project) defense is the final committee meeting. Prior to this meeting the committ ee will carefully review, edit, and critique the scholarly review article (final project) and will provide any changes to the student during the meeting. Committee members may orally examine the student's general and specific knowledge. Significant defic its in the project will require the student to revise and resubmit the document to the committee within 30 days of the defense. Three of four committee members must vote to pass the student and a form signed by all committee members must be submitted to M CGSBS immediately upon completion of the defense. 71 Virology and Gene Therapy (VGT) - Employee-Professional Masters Michael A. Barry, Ph.D., Program Director Autumn J. Schulze, Ph.D., Associate Program Director There are two pathways to choose from: The REGULATORY/TRANSLATIONAL PATHWAY student will gain a broad scope of gene therapy and will learn how to develop a gene based therapeutic from an idea to a validated product. Various gene therapy strategies will be considered in relation to a broad spectrum of human diseases illustrating how genes can be used for gene replacement, tissue engineering, destruction of unwanted tissues, or immune stimulation. Stages in the development of gene -based drugs & biologics will be stud ied from vector design through preclinical proof of efficacy, clinical protocol development, product manufacture, pharmacology and toxicology testing, analysis of clinical trial outcomes, regulatory affairs, patenting and partnering with industry. The Regulatory/Translation pathway is designed for those learners who desire to conduct or participate in research that will identify therapies/devices that will move into manufacturing facilities. The RESEARCH PATHWAY student will learn from and work alongside faculty members who have primary interests in virology, viral vectors and gene therapy and will develop research skills in conducting or participate in vaccine and gene therapy discovery. These areas overlap with the fields of biochemistry, cell and molecular biology, genetics, and immunology and regulatory science. The Research pathway is designed for learners who desire to be an informed member of a research team conducting or participating in Virology and Gene Therapy research. Course Require ments A total of 45 credits to be completed over two to four years with maintenance of at least a 3.0 GPA are required for graduation.

Training in research is emphasized. The degree program provides a structure for development of a plan to address a research problem, an orderly approach to the project, assurance of the credentials of the mentor , appropriate supervision, and a suitable approach to the analysis and presentation of the results. Courses in basic biomedical sciences are required to provide the student with the knowledge to address a research problem, conduct the research and evaluate the results. Courses in the track are required in addition to provide special skills, techniques or knowledge related to the specialty track. General program requirements and specialty track descriptions are outlined on the following pages. Degree candidates must be enrolled in the program at least one year prior to graduation. Eligibility This program is designed for Mayo residents who hold appointments to the clinical progr ams of Mayo School of Graduate Medical Education. Potential candidates for the degree must hold appointments of sufficient duration to complete degree program requirements. The opportunity to take graduate school courses is a benefit and privilege for qualified trainees, but not a guarantee. Permission to take courses may be restricted and/or forfeited at the discretion of the learner's program director if expectations of the learner's primary training role are not being met. Any violation of Mayo Clinic policies may forfeit acceptance into a Master's degree program. Tuition No tuition or program fee; incorporated into residency training . 74 Application Candidates must complete an Application for Graduate Training Master's Program in Biomedical Sciences -Clinical Specialties form. The application must be approved by the track program director and MCGSBS . This form is available from the MCGSBS Master's Programs web page . Time Requirement All requirements must be satisfied within 30 days of the thesis defense. Registration Requirement At least 75% of the coursework for the Master's degree must be compl eted in MCGSBS . Enrollment in the degree program for a minimum of one year is required. It is expected that a minimum of six months will be devoted to research. Minimum Credit Requirements Students must complete a minimum of 12 credits in basic biomedical sciences and 12 additional credits in the track (credits may vary depending on the chosen track but the minimum MCGSBS credit requirement must be met). Six of the 12 credits in the track must be didactic credits. It is expected that a minimum of six mont hs will be devoted to research. Students are not admitted to a specialty track unless there is reasonable assurance that course work required for completion of degree requirements is available. Transfer Credits A total of 6 didactic credits may be transferred into the Clinical Master's Program. For more details, see the Credit Transfer Polic y on the MCGSBS Policies and Procedures intranet site . Mentor A Master's degree mentor must have MCGSBS full or Master's graduate faculty privileges. A List of Faculty with Privileges can be found on the MCGSBS intranet site. Official Degree Planning Tool The use of a Degree Planning Tool (DPT) is required and allows students to list the course work to f ulfill degree requirements, including transfer credits. Fifty percent of the credits counting toward degree must be graded on the A -F grading system. The DPT must be completed during the first academic year and should be updated as courses are completed throughout the training program. Variation from the original course plan must be approved by the program director. A final completed DPT must be submi tted to the school when your defense date has been determined. The DPT is available on the MCGSBS intranet site under For Students/General Forms/Resources/Master's Forms . Minimum Grade Requirements Students are expected to maintain a grade point average of 3.0 in didactic course work. Students whose performance falls below this standard in a given quarter will be placed on academic probation, as described in the Deficiencies and Unsatisfactory Progress and Warning, Probation and Dismissal policies outli ned on the MCGSBS intranet Policies and Procedures webpage. 75 Examinations Written Examination: A comprehensive written examination must be taken before completion of the training program. MCGSBS must be informed of the date of the examination three weeks in advance so that the Master's Written Examination Report form can be sent to the track progra m director. The written examination may be taken no more than twice. If it is not passed on the first attempt, it must be retaken by the end of the quarter following the quarter in which it was first taken. Failing the examination twice will result in dismissal. The written examination must be passed before the final oral examination may be scheduled. Final Oral Examination : Candidates for the Master's degree are expected to pass the final oral examination before completion of the Mayo residency or fellows hip training program. The final oral examination may be taken after: 1) the written examination has been passed, 2) all course work shown on the Degree Program form has been completed, and 3) the thesis is reviewed. MCGSBS must be informed of the date of the examination three weeks in advance so that the Master's Final Oral Examination Report form can be sent to the Thesis Advisory Committee chair. The student's mentor must sign a form indicating that he/she has read the thesis and that it is ready for defense prior to distribution to the Thesis Advisory Committee members. The Verification that the Thesis is Ready to Defend form can be accessed on the MCGSBS intranet site. A copy of the title page of the thesis and the form must be submitted to the MCGSBS office. The thesis must be submitted to the Thesis Advisory Committee at least three weeks before the final oral examination. Voting members of the Thesis Advisory Committee must be present in real time via physical presence or video - or teleconferencing at the final oral examination. Only one dissenting vote will be allowed for a \"Pass.\" Passage of the final oral examination req uires a minimum of three passing votes; otherwise a determination of \"Fail\" must be made. Thus, no more than one Thesis Advisory Committee member may be absent for the final oral examination. The final oral examination may be taken no more than twice. If i t is not passed on the first attempt, it must be retaken by the end of the quarter following the quarter in which the exam was first taken. Failing the examination twice will result in dismissal. Thesis Thesis Protocol: This protocol must clearly define the candidate's role in the project and must have sufficient detail to permit review by an advisory committee. An Outline for the Master's Thesis Protocol is available on the MCGSBS intranet site. The Recommended Action on Thesis Protocol for Clinical Master's Degree form ( thesis protocol form ) is also available on the intranet site . The Mayo Institutional Review Board must review all protocols for research involving the use of human subjects. It is the candidate's responsibility to secure approval of any such protocols before the research is undertaken. Thesis Advisory Committee : With the thesis protocol, students must submit the Master's Thesis Advisory Committee e- form r ecommending the members of their thesis advisory/ final oral examining committee and the Degree Program form. All members must have graduate faculty privileges and the chair must have a m inimum of Master's graduate faculty privileges. The examining committee must consist of four members, one of whom is the student's mentor , who serves as chair of the committee. Any additional Thesis Advisory Committee members beyond four will be designated as \"ex officio\" and will not vote at the final defense. No more than two members of the committee may have teaching/examining privileges. The recommended committee must be approved by the track program director and MCGSBS . 76 Progress Meetings : The Master's Thesis Advisory Committee must meet every six months from the date of committee approval. Doc umentation of student progress , using the progress meeting form , must be signed by all members of the Thesis Advisory Committee, and saved within the program. Preparation of Thesis : The thesis is the most important document that the Master's candidate will prepare during the course of graduate study and is a record of the scientific accomplishments that justify the awarding of the degree. The thesis is submitted to Proquest. Consequ ently, MCGSBS has developed a standard for its format and style, which should be closely followed. Guidelines for Master's thesis are available on the MCGSBS intranet site at For Students/General Forms/Resources. Final Thesis Corrections: After the studen t has passed the final oral examination, the chair of the Thesis Advisory Committee must sign a form indicating he/she is satisfied that the final corrections to the thesis have been made. The chair must sign before the student will be cleared for graduati on. MCGSBS will not certify completion of degree requirements until the final thesis has been submitted. Graduation Students are granted degrees four times a year (3rd Friday except in May it is the date of commencement) : February, May, August, and November. Students are allowed no more than 30 days to complete M.S. degree requirements after a successful thesis defense. If a student does not meet this deadline, he/she will be required to re- defend their thesis. 77 Dentistry - Orthodontics (ODON) - Clinical Master 's Degree Chad M.

The goal of the course is to enable the student to employ greater discernment in identifying the ethical issues raised by technologies, and to routinely prospectively consider and address ethical challenges and implications in the development and implementation of new technologies. The history of bioethics is a history of surprised reaction to new developments in biomedical technology. The technologies on the horizon, near and far, are of such power and potential for harm, as well a s good, that we cannot afford to remain in reactive mode. Increasingly, biomedical and other technological innovations have dual use potential, that is, the potential to be weaponized, or be used in ways contrary to respect for human life and human dignity in addition to their usually intended beneficial use. Innovators, engineers and technologists have a moral obligation if possible to anticipate, prevent, and mitigate potential harms and misuse before the damage is done. Those in developmental pathways ar e in the ideal position to identify those issues early, but only if they embrace this task. This course will examine similarities between medical ethics and engineering ethics, reviewing professional codes for engineering ethics, discussing classic cases o f engineering misadventures, and examining contemporary challenges now facing us.

Klee, L. Schimmenti , F. Pinto e Vairo - Analysis of genomic data from patients suffering from genetic disorders is now an essential skill for physicians and scientists in the clinical and translational arena. Patients who suffer from rare and undiagnosed disease are sometimes referred to as \"medical mysteries\". To find a diagnosis for a medical mystery patient, sequencing of the entire coding region of the genome (exome sequencing), or the entire genome (genome sequencing), is employed. Currently, there is a shortage of individuals who possess the bioinformatics and genetics knowledge to analyze the sequencing data and identify potentially pathogenic variants leading to a diagnosis for medical mystery patients. This course is designed to give students the essential skills to take exome or genom e sequence data from real patients and identify a pathogenic sequence variant that leads to a diagnosis. In this course, students will be provided with clinical data from an actual medical odyssey patient from the Mayo Clinic. The cases have been previousl y solved by the Translational Omics Program (TOP) team through a Genomic Odyssey Board (GOB) within the Center for Individualized Medicine and identified to have pathogenic sequence variants that are consistent with their medical phenotype. Students will b e given raw exome sequencing data and the medical phenotype of the patient only.

Purpose To define options and set expectations for students seeking an absence from their educational programs while maintaining good standing in their MCGSBS appointments. Policy Attendance Students are expected to attend and be on time for all required learnin g activities, including in the classroom, laboratory, or other learning environments. Students who are absent, tardy or depart early from their required learning activities, are considered an unexcused absence, unless approved for one of the excused absenc es listed below. Unexcused absences and tardiness will be addressed through the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science Warning, Probation, Dismissal and Appeal Polic y and Procedure . Excused Absences Vacation Students are allowed 15 days of vacation per year beginning on the date of commencement of their appointment. Weekends and holidays are not charged as vacation time. MCGSBS observes federals holidays as defined in the Mayo Clinic Holidays Policy . Vacation cannot be carried over from one 12 month period to another; Approval of when to take vacation is obtained from the graduate school program director until a mentor has been iden tified. Students will not be paid for unused vacation. If a student is denied the ability to use vacation days this must be reported to the graduate school. L eave of Absence MCGSBS allows students to take an approved Leave of Absence ( LOA ) when significant extenuating personal circumstances impact their ability for continuation in the program. 139 An LOA must be approved by the MCGSBS Academic Affairs Committee and communicated to the program director and mentor (if assigned). An LOA must be requested in accordance with the Absence and Leave Procedure . Lack of communication or failure to provide required documentation for an LOA will result in student being placed in an unpaid personal leave until documentation is provided, disciplinary action or both. Failure to return from a leave of absence on the expected return date without an approved extension is considered voluntary resignation. In order to allow equal training time for PhD students, an LOA will result in an automatic extension of training end date, e.g. a three month LOA pushes out training end date three additional months. This change will be made in the student record after completion of the LOA. o This change of end date does not apply to MD-PhD students due to the impact on return to MD training; however LOA time is considered if an extension of training is requested. A student on LOA must be allowed for responsibilities associated with their training to be suspended throughout the leave period. MCGSBS can provide assistance as needed to negotiate these expectations with the student's mentor, including any re quired assignments, courses, meetings, or research- related responsibilities. A student is not eligible to take qualifying exams while on LOA. Leave Types Medical Leave of Absence (Medical Leave) Medical Leave can be used for a qualifying serious health condition of the student or of an immediate family member who requires the student's direct care. To qualify for a Medical Leave the student must submit medical documentation to Student Services from their health care provider supporting their condition that results in their inability to perform the essential functions of their training with or without ac commodations. (See Confirmation of Leave in Definitions below and the Provider Instruct ions Medical LOA for guidance.) o Documentation from the student's health care provider must be submitted to Student Services within 15 calendar days of the start of the LOA. (See exceptions below for International Students which must be completed prior to start of LOA.) If a letter cannot be obtained within 15 calendar days, the student must contact Student Services within this timeline to discuss expected date of receipt; else the absence will be considered unpaid personal leave until documentation is provided. If communication or documentation is not received by Student Services within 30 calendar days of the start of LOA, the absence will be considered unexcused absence and will be addressed through the Mayo Clinic Colleg e of Medicine and Science Warning, Probation, Dismissal and Appeal Policy and Procedure . 140 o In the absence of such documentation, the student must use vacation or be placed on unpaid Personal LOA (see below). o Final approval for the use of Medical Leave is m ade by the College Disability Officer, not the graduate school.
