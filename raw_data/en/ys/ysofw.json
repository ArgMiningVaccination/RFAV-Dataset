The following section is from [nccih.nih.gov/health/naturopathy](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/naturopathy) Education and licensing differ for the three types of naturopathic practitioners: - Naturopathic physicians generally complete a 4-year, graduate-level program at one of the North American naturopathic medical schools accredited by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education, an organization recognized for accreditation purposes by the U.S. Department of Education. Some U.S. states and territories have licensing requirements for naturopathic physicians; others don't. In those jurisdictions that have licensing requirements, naturopathic physicians must graduate from a 4-year naturopathic medical college and pass an examination to receive a license. They must also fulfill annual continuing education requirements. - Traditional naturopaths, also known simply as \"naturopaths,\" may receive training in a variety of ways. Training programs vary in length and content and are not accredited by organizations recognized for accreditation purposes by the U.S. Department of Education. Traditional naturopaths are often not eligible for licensing. - Other health care providers (such as physicians, osteopathic physicians, chiropractors, dentists, and nurses) sometimes offer naturopathic treatments, functional medicine, and other holistic therapies, having pursued additional training in these areas. Training programs vary. \"Naturopathic treatment is guided by six principles: - First, do no harm. Traditional naturopathy embraces only therapies or procedures designed to enhance healing and produce wellness. Naturopathic doctors use minimally invasive and nontoxic remedies, proven safe and effective by research and clinical practice. - Recognize the healing power of nature. The human body has the capacity to heal itself and maintain homeostasis. Naturopathy works in harmony with nature to restore and support the body's natural healing systems. In providing treatment, naturopathic doctors are educated in the use of natural remedies, and refer as appropriate for surgery of pharmaceutical medication. - Educate the patient and encourage self-responsibility. Naturopathy places responsibility for wellness with the individual. A high value is placed on education and counseling to help patients address lifestyle, nutritional, emotional, and dietary factors under their control. - Consider the whole person. For individual care, naturopathic doctors consider not only lab results, family history, and physical symptoms but also the mental, emotional, environmental, social, and spiritual factors that affect health. - Identify and treat the cause. Naturopathic doctors strive to identify and treat the cause of disease. Correction of the cause is considered the most plausible and sustainable way to eliminate symptoms. Rather than using pain killers to reduce joint pain, for example, the doctor would address the medicines, inflammation, conditions, injury, nutritional deficiency, or other causes of the pain. - Prevent disease. Naturopathic doctors advise patients about preventive measures to maintain health and avoid disease.\" \"The doctor of the future will give no medicine but will interest his patient in the care of the human frame, in diet and in the cause and prevention of disease.\" - Thomas Edison, 1903 "}
