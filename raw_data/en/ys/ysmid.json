His research has focused on developing better methods of detecting disease-causing organisms and preventing viral infections in animals. He has clinical experience in hog, dairy, cow-calf and feedlot herd health. In this episode, learn why testing every animal at birth is so important, well as why stillbirths, abortions and sudden deaths should also be tested. Dr. Chase discusses different testing methods, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests using ear-notches or blood samples. He also covers when pooled laboratory samples may be appropriate. Dr. Chase recommends working with your veterinarian on a testing strategy to help minimize contaminated samples and the influence of recent vaccination that may impact test results. Finally, you'll learn about transient BVDV infections, or infections that the animal's immune system can clear it on its own, and when it might be worth a 30-day quarantine for animals that test positive.
