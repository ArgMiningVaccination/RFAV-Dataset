Calendula is helpful for easing sunburn or calming bug bites, and because it's so gentle, Manley also formulates all of her brand's baby products with the flower. The plant is an antiseptic, and has been shown to help heal abrasions and wounds thanks to its antiviral properties. Its high levels of flavonoids are thought to restore capillary function and benefit blood flow, make it ideal for increasing circulation and relaxing muscles. Calendula is also hydrating and firming; it leaves skin soft, rejuvenated and glowing, which is why it's frequently included in facial mists and cleanser formulas.

Estheticians at Nature's Spa By Jurlique at the Kimpton Hotel Palomar San Diego use several of the brand's calendula-infused products in the customizable Jurlique Signature Facial (30-90 min./$95-$185). \"If a guest has redness or sensitivity, calendula is great for calming their complexion,\" says spa director Gwen McGuire. \"We're able to rehydrate, soften, cool and soothe the skin, leaving the client with a nice, healthy glow instead of a bright red face.\" Her team also opts for the calendula products following pumpkin peels or the use of glycolic, lactic or salicylic acids. \"Resurfacing treatments can be a bit harsh but the Calendula Redness Rescue Restorative Treatment Serum calms skin within minutes; the guest doesn't feel like they've had a chemical peel\u2014just a nice exfoliation without the downtime,\" she says. McGuire also reports that having the Calendula Redness Rescue line on hand has been helpful for her team. \"When a guest expresses concern about their sensitive skin, we can actually promise them that after their treatment they'll have a healthy, glowing complexion,\" she enthuses. \"They're always amazed\u2014and completely comfortable\u2014walking out of the spa without makeup on!\" Quick Facts: - Calendula blooms should be harvested in the summer, on hot days when resins are high and dew has evaporated. - To maintain its bright color, calendula is dried carefully at low temperatures. - In Medieval Europe, calendula was \"poor man's saffron.\" Today, it's used as a spice and natural coloring in icings, custards, rice and other foods. - The flowering herb grows quickly and reseeds itself, making it easy to cultivate in pots or a garden.
