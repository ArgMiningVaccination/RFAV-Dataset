Structural Considerations in the ; 1iI-= Preface In recent years, the International Association of Chiefs of Police has become aware of increasing demands for help in understanding poli~e discipline.! Disci\u00ad pline is an important concern to both citizens and law enforcement profes\u00ad sionals. Police administrators have faced challenges by the community and in court, as well as morale problems in their own departments. However, there has been little effective study of this subject, and adequate guidance has not been available to those who are daily involved in discipline. Citizens have pressed-for justification and reform of the entire system. Police officers have raised objections to rules, procedures and dispositions which they deem unfair and improper. Too often, antiquated disciplinary procedures have been maintained without review. Rank-and-file officers have felt frustrated with the differing interpretations of the rationale and effect of controversial rules. Because court decisions surrounding some disciplinary issues have not been widely studied, many departments enforce rules and procedures which are illegal. This need at a practical level was the motivation for the extensive study begun early in 1974 by the IACP and reported herein. Many aspects of discipline were examined in seventeen selected police departments. The purpose of the project was to give insights into the determinants of effective discipline manage\u00ad ment and to provide practitioners with useful recommendations for understand\u00ad ing and improving their disciplinary practices. The study was funded by the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, National Institute of Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice. The initial project task was to review all available literature, make a survey of common mlel; and procedures used by representative agencies, and visit nearby departments to determine the dimensions and character of common disciplinary practices. An advisory board contributed direction throughout the project. This preliminary phase was undertaken to formulate the precise areas and variables to be addressed, and to develop the research design. As is often true in projects of this type, several obstacles were encountered in the early period of problem definition. There was little evidence in everyday 1 The term police discipline, as used throughout this text, refers to discipline in all types of law enforcement organizations. v PREFACE practice that discipline was employed to enhance overall performance of depart\u00ad ments. No commonly accepted objectives of discipline were available as refer\u00ad ence points for the study. A number of conceptual schemes were developed and evaluated by the project staff as possible frameworks for field work. Research methodology consultants, chosen by IACP and NILECJ, aided in selecting and defining a final research design. Many design decisions were necessary in limiting the study to an effective scope. One decision was to limit research to issues affecting sworn officers, and to exclude from study the special situation of civiliaI! police department employees. This limitation was felt to be desirable due to fundamental differ\u00ad ences between civilian and sworn personnel with regard to imposed standards of conduct, training. Joh performance requirements, internal administrative proce\u00ad dures, and expec:.Jtions of the community. After all instruments were pre-tested and field work was initiated, the research design Wf:lS tailored to accommodate departmental differences. Deficiencies in dep,,:tmental records on disciplinary matters were common. In many instances, personnel records were not maintained in a manner to facilitate sampling. At times, IACP staff found it difficult to ensure an appropriate degree of anonymity for the individuals tested and interviewed. These constraints, how\u00ad ever, appear to be of no greater consequence than is to be expected in survey research. Participating agencies were very cooperative in adapting to project requirements. The seventeen ;~t'lice departments involved in the main study phase were chosen to present a wide range of operating conditions. Each participating department made available all materials relating to disciplinary standards and procedures, and provided &ccess to many individual administrators and field officers for interviews. The data-gathering and analysis by IACP staff were con\u00ad ducted from the following four perspectives: administrative, government official and community interest group, officer attitude, and legal. This approach allowed independent views of each of a number of issues, giving a more sound basis for interpreting the overall data. All four types of data were gathered at the site of each of the seventeen agencies with one exception. Employee questionnaires were not completed at the request of one agency wh:ch was involved in labor negotiations at the time of the IACP visit. The results of the project are: (a) an individual report of findings to each participating department; (b) this document, which conveys the general practical implications of the combined findings, including detailed quantitative results of the research at the project sites; and (c) a summary report highlighting major project findings and recommendations. vi <; i Preface The purpose of this document is to share with the reader an interpretation by the project staff of the information gathered in this research. The informa\u00ad tion has diverse sources, yet common themes and relationships have clearly emerged. The intention, from the beginning of the projec:, has been to deve~o? guidance useful to the widest possible audience. Accor?mgl y, no one explICIt \"model\" for optimum diScipline is applicable to all agenCIes. Any model must be modified for local variations, such as laws, size of agency, type of agency, and status of labor relations. An analysis of the issues relating to discipline has been given, followed by a synthesis of those findings to demonstrate how important factors might be identified in different local situations. Chapter One explores the sources of the trad~tional ~iew of discipline. as a management technique to control employee behaVIOr. It dIscusses the negatIve character of discipline and the view that discipline is a single isolated manage\u00ad ment function. It also contrasts the military model of management and discipline with a more adaptive organizational approach. A self-appraisal by police managers, with these models in mind, will identify starting points for con\u00ad structing a new disciplinary system. Chapters Two, Three, and Four treat im~ortant areas of departmental operation, including the tools of discipline, the processes used, and the people involved. Separate analysis of these subjects will help the reader to diagnose specific agency problems. Chapter Two discusses the usefulness of tools for effective discipline. These tools are the structural resources of management. These resources are basic building blocks which, when integrated with processes and people, make an effective system possible. The structural resources available to a department are many and varied. A few examples are written directives delineating management expectations, assignments of authority and accountability, units for inspection and control, and goals and objectives for internal discipline. Chapter Three develops the idea that in the handling of disciplinary cases, the process is similar for all major cases. Often as many as ten elements are included, such as conduct of investigations, imposition of sanctions, and appeals. For minor infractions, the process may be simplified. The purpose, application and results of each elemen t are discussed. Chapter Four deals with the effects of the personalities, skills, motives and roles of people involved in the management of diSCipline. People are a significant resource which management must use wisely. Selecting individuals and assigning them to formal organizational pOSitions is a fundamental task of leadership. Participating, monitoring, recognizing expectations, and coping with conflicts among values and roles, are some of the topics covered in this chapter. vii ,------~ ------ - I'REPACE Chapter Five compiles key ideas from the t!tree previous chapters, with page references. Statements selected and grouped hi Chapter Five present a com\u00ad pact, practical outline for persons who are considering organizational changes. Chapter Six is a prototype document containing rules of conduct and disciplinary procedures for police organizations. These rules and procedures are designed to promote effective management control of officer behavior, and to provi.d~ officers with a degree of persona! freedom appropriate to contemporary condItIOns. The rules and procedures are based on recent court decisions as well as the discipline experience of many departments, The prototype should serve as a foundation for departments to develop variations in accordance with their local needs. The concepts and evidence discussed here must be compared with individual agency characteristics. Methodical self-diagnosis and corresponding follow-up action by police management teams are necessary. It is hoped that this report will serve to stimulate and guide in that effort. The first edition of this book was published in 1976. Since then, many new cases on police discipline have been decided. These decisions are reported in Appendix B. Except for the addition of these new cases, the text remains basically the same as in the first edition. As ~as stated previously, the prototype rules and procedures presented h~r~ a.re mtended only as a guide to assist others in developing a sound dlsclp11l1ary system. No one should assume that the rules and procedures can be implemented without careful review and alteration to meet local conditions . Likewise, the cases presented in the Annotated Bibliography (Append'ix B) are mtended as a reference only. The complete text of any case referred to should b,) carefully reviewed and analyzed before making a decision as to its meaning and relevance to a particular issue at hand. viii Acknowledgements Two key resources made this project possible: funding by the National Institute of Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice (NlLECJ), and the cooperation of many police departments across the United States. Staff members at NILECJ (the research component of the Law Enforce\u00ad ment Assistance Administration) made valuable critiques of the early concept papers prepared by the Legal Research Section of the lACP, and approved fund\u00ad ing of the project in April 1974. Seventeen police agencies representative of a large segmen t of the police community in this coun try were selected to partici\u00ad pate. These agencies committed substantial staff resources and were most cooperative in meeting research needs. We are grateful to the over 2,000 pohce officers who responded to the lACP questionnaire. We also thank those addi\u00ad tional departments which furnished materials relating to their disciplinary practices. The project staff was fortunate to have the assistance of a dedicated advisory board.

GLEN R. MURPHY Director Bureau of Governmental Relations and Legal Counsel international Association of Chiefs of Police xi ---------------~-----------------------------~----------------------~~========--------------- 1 Discipline as Part of the Management System INTRODUCTION The subject of police discipline is an excellent example of the maxim that \"the definition of the problem is half the solution.\" Discipline is not well understood. Critical analyses of disciplinary practices are rare in most police organizations. Normally, criticism originates with an individual who has a narrow interest and demands a solution to an immediate problem; i.e., a citizen wants to know why a particular complaint was not recorded, a police officer wants to know the reason for being singled out for reprimand, a police administrator wants to know why simple regulations cannot be enforced without throwing the entire depart\u00ad ment into turmoil. This attitude is similar to the behavior of an irate customer who has lost a ccin in a cigarette machine. By kicking the machine, the customer hopes either to get the coin back or to get the cigarettes. This individual is not overly COll\u00ad cerned with the reason for the coin sticking nor the inner workings of the machine. Perspectives usually held by people toward police discipline, while some\u00ad what varied, do tend to share the idea that discipline (or creating a desired quality of discipline) is one of several distinct functions of police management which is to be carried out througll the simple exercise of authority-in short, a matter of \"kicking the machine.\" Frequently discipline is given a negative connotation-referring to either a technique to prevent negative behavior on the job, or a punishment when such negative behavior occurs. While the word \"diScipline\" was originally defined as 1 DICIPLlNE PART OF THE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM instruction, teaching or training, its meaning has shifted toward a concept of control. As stated by A. C. Germann, \"[N] egative discipline is the threat or imposition of punishment upon the person who failed to conform or in a sense did not learn.\"! The distinction between teaching and control is i~portant in it~ implications for any organization's management, and specifically p~lice manage\u00ad ment. Too many police organizations stress control, while placing minor empha\u00ad sis on instruction. In response to the statement, \"[T] he term 'discipline' can best be defined as ... ,\" only 20 percent of police officers sampled in the cur\u00ad ren~ study chose the completing phrase, \" ... training or counseling to improve poltce o~~cer perfom1ance.\"2 The first-line supervisor, in particular, is prone to use pU~ltJve ';!ethods to control behavior. Egon Bittner has described the police supemsor as ... someone who can only do a great deal to his subordinates and very little for them. ,,3 A POSITIVE VIEW OF DISCIPLINE The dominance of negative aspects of discipline has disturbed many police obse~:rs who f~el that a positive emphasis will improve the morale and pro\u00ad ductlVlty .of pohc~ office:s. A first step in approaching discipline differently is to reconsl.der basIc premls.es .. ~or example, it is easy to think of disciplinary problem.s In terms of the 1I1dlvldual who will not conform; but the focus may be~ong mstead on organizational practices in establishing and making known SUItable rul.es .and procedures, or in processing disciplinary cases. Several military research studIes suggest that the conforming behavior of individual members depends more on perceptions of these practices than on soldiers' personal characteristics.4 Similarly, it is too common for rules of conduct and disciplinaty proce\u00ad dUres to be used as an end in themselves-their purpose as an aid to reaching departmental goals is f~rg?t~en. It is necessary to question the origin of present rules of conduct and dlsclplmary procedures in order to pinpoint the intended 1 Thomas~i9i8}~~rr~~~n, Police Persollnel Management (Springfield, Winois: Charles C. for standards of conduct\" \"5 t\u00b7 \" t' d' ' officers to obey police standards\" 30 t ,~percen, an at ItU e whIch causes 3 ' percen.

Mahan, Jr., \"Attitudes Predictive of Marine Combat Effectiveness, Journal ojSocial Psychology, 83 (1971), pp. 55-62. L: JIlf!lIendng Officer Behavior: The MilitalY Legacy 3 goals. There are different solutions to these problems because the problems themselves are different. Without question, both social and organizational environments are changing dramatically. Citizen perspectives of the police service, as well as officers' views of their departments have changed. Many citizen groups demand a high level of integrity from their police agency, and expect responsiveness to complaints and rapid resolUtion to all incidents of mis\u00ad conduct. At the same time, officers have adopted new standards of conduct consistent with new societal values. The role of discipline during this period of change cannot escape revision. Now is an appropriate time to treat discipline as a managerial resource in need of development. If the disciplinary aspects of managing police officers can be given positive emphasis, a much needed manage\u00ad ment tool will be created to replace a system which too often acts to reduce morale and motivation, and which strains police-citizen relationships. INFLUENCING OFFICER BEHAVIOR: THE MILITARY LEGACY M1Jnagement's goals in any organization are not necessarily the inherent goals o{ employees. A basic tactic of sophisticated management is to bring these goals into harmony. A common approach to management which attempts to converge these goals can be called the \"military model.\" This approach has been the dominant influence in the development of to day's police organizations. The term \"military model\" is used here to describe a management style, rather than to denote militaristic quality in the execution of law enforcement per se. This model comprises the total body of management philosophy and techniques used to achieve compliance to direct orders. This style reached the peak of its expres\u00ad sion in most of the world's armed forces of the first half of this centmy. Several management principles, such as unity of command, clearly delineated au thority, formal communications through channels, and standardization of roles, were applied to achieve control in these organizations. This style of management was also adopted at an early date by private and public sector management to achieve c(;mtrol of employee conduct. While private industry has discarded many of the more visible 3nd control-oriented features of the military model, the public sector in general and police organizations in particulllr have not. In the military context itself, several techniques are used in an attempt to cause an integration of the goals of management with those of the soldier. For example, considerable attention is given to training soldiers to internalize the goals of protecting their territory from incursions of other armies and of preserv-I f. II 4 DISCIPLINE PART OF THE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ing the liberties of their fellow citizens. However, the military model makes use of a more foC!.!~ed technique for controlling and directing soldier behavior toward desired \"common\" goals. To buttress this effort, the concept of military discipline has been developed. Discipline in this form has a clear identity and is elaborated in well-defined codes and procedures. In this context, discipline has been defined as \" ... a function of command that must be exercised in order to develop a force amenable to direction and control.\"s The implicit aim of this approach is to achieve more certainty of control over behavior. Also implied is the idea that there is \"one best way\" for individuals to behave in pursuit of organizational goals, and that deviance from that way should be detected and corrected. Advocates of the military model hold that in addition to behavioral con\u00ad trol induced by simple threat or fear of sanctions, soldier self-discipline is also gained. At one level, those who comply would feel rewarded for their com\u00ad pliance simply by seeing punishment suffered only by those who deviate. If supervisors can maintain this consistency, each officer may voluntarily follow management directives. Furthermore, those who com pI} may be rewarded by peer approval. Thus, the military model is aimed at two outcomes. The first is self\u00ad discipline, believed to be developed through activities such as stress training and continuous, explicit applications of rewards and punishments tied to a wide range of behavior. The second is group discipline, or esprit de corps, depending on a self-reinforcing relation!1hip among peers and between the peer group and its leadership. Both of these outcomes are also often associated with the challenge of high standards (e.g., in the form of competition) and pride in accomplishment. In the military, intermediate goals with which soldiers can readily identify, such as winning at team sports, are sometimes introduced for the purpose of building esprit. The intention is that positive results will general\u00ad ize to any situation in which the primary goals of management are pursued. TESTING THE MODEL AGAINST CHANGING NEEDS The military model of management and the sub-model of military disci\u00ad pline were developed and found in their purest form in a time and context markedly different from the world of police management in the 1970s. Even within the military, discipline has changed over the years, particularly since Sw. B. Melnicoe and 1. Mennig, Elements of Police Supervision (Beverly Hills: Glencoe, 1969), p. 77. Testing the Model Against Changing Needs 5 World War II. Arguably, greater change has been realized in the armed forces than in many police departments. Generally, the total application of the military model may have a negative impact on police management effectiveness today, due to a basic lack of congruence between the premises underlying the model and conditions in contemporary law enforcement. This contrast is highlighted when related to the follOWing objectives which have been proposed by Leavitt, Dill and Eyring as important in reducing in ternal conflict in organizations:6 1. A high degree of socialization of members, 2. Well-structured tasks, and 3. A stable environment. In reference to the first objective, the military has much more influence in fostering socialization among its members than do police organizations. The police officer attitude survey conducted during this project indicates a variety of opinions among officers with factions evidenced in differing age groups, educa\u00ad tional levels, and other personal and social characteristics. While socialization can be strong within police cliques and subgroups, homogeneity across entire police organizations is not a reality. Under the second objective, military tasks are well structured in the sense that a planned team approach is adopted for operations, even when the exact nature of the mission is not known until it develops. Team operations in policing have been the exception. The majority of routine work, such as patrol, involves one or two officers in a sequence of unstructured assignments. Each daily tour of duty is unique in its pattern of events. The third objective stresses the importance of a stable environment, and While the larger environment of the military it. stable only to the extent of com\u00ad mon world circumstances, many measures are taken to modify the immediate environment of the individual soldier. Standardization of equipment, living quarters, daily work aSSignments and a far-reaching array of personnel practices all contribute to a contrived stability of environment, relatively independent of outside events. Police officers, however, incre'asingly treat their work as an o.ccupation separate from their private lives. Even though the nolice organiza\u00ad tIOn ma~ntains Some military-like measures to promote stability,; the impact on officers IS probably small compared to influences in their \"civilian\" lives. Also, 6H. 1. Leavitt, W. R. Dill and H. B. Eyring, The Organizational World (New York' Harcourt, Brace, and Jovanovich, 1973), p. 16. . 6 DISCIPLINE PART OF THE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM the role of the police department in its environment does noteI:able the depa.rt\u00ad ment to insulate itself as successfully as the military. The result IS that the pollce officer is not heavily conditioned to perceive a stable environment merely as a result of the manipulations of police management. In summary, the sources of motivation and control of milit~~ personnel, their patterns of work, and their working environn:ent as. traditIOnally. eon\u00ad ceived can differ substantially f,rom those of pollce officers, Accordmgly, milita;y models of management and discipline may not be the optimum choice for police management. TREATING DISCIPLINARY ISSUES AS INTEGRAL WITH OTHER MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES Logically, an alternative to a military management perspective might be that of business, industry and public service organizations. Although most man\u00ad agement principles of the western world had their origi~ and. earl~ developl~1ent in a military context, they have seen important modlficahons JI1 the pr~vate sector. These modifications have served to answer the survival needs of bUSiness as it copes with its environment. Police organizations operate in. th~t same \"civilian\" environment. Drawing from the same labor pool, competmg ll1 terms of working conditions and employee expectations, both pol~ce and business exist to deliver a service or product to the same market-the publIc. How do the military and business approaches to management differ? Citing superficial examples may not show a clear difference, because of wide variations in practice. It is possible to find business firms with codes.of co~du~t and scales of punishment more explicit and detailed than those whlch eXlst lt1 the military. It is also possible to find military units where disciplinary measures are left largely to peer influences, Generally, however, an important di~tin~tion of the private-sector is its flexible, experimental approach to orgalllzattOnal problems, which de-emphasizes rigid, preconceived solution~ based o.nly on managers' deliberations. This approach is careful and responsIble, ~~t.lt~ hall\u00ad mark is an openness to scrutiny and change. It is a management ll1lt1atl~e to achieve control but i1. may accommodate participation by the rank-and-fIle. It aims at consid:ring and balancing many aspects of the department's problems and possibilities at once, It is a continuous process involving many members and levels of the organization, not an autocratic approach by management to a per-Treating Discipli/lary Issues 7 manent method for running the department; it is organic, not mechanistic.7 This openness to input extends beyond the organization. A police department exists to serve its community by pursuing a long list of goals reflecting community interests. These interests are forcefully spelled out by groups as diverse as trade unions, ethnic action committees, courts, arbitrators, civil service systems, private citiZens, and political office holders. Often a mismatch develops between the expectations of the community and the police department. Community goals may become seriously incompatible with the goals of the department and of individual officers. Management policies and actions, including those labeled \"disciplinary,\" may be based on values which are not supported by some elements of the community. Management may have created a focus on internal objectives, such as overuse of the chain of command, or \"spit and polish,\" instead of external and service goals. In these cases, the agency has failed to sense environmental needs and to adapt its operation to them. The potential for these mismatches is always present. A routine watchful\u00ad ness by management and the capacity to make responsive changes is necessary. This \"adaptive coping cycle\" can be developed within the normal resources of most organizations where management is willing to involve both members of the organization and the external environment.s Contrasted with this alternative viewpoint on management, some tradi\u00ad tional ideas about diScipline appear to be misconceptions. DiSCipline does not, in the new context, appear as a system or subsystem of management to be manipu\u00ad lated independently, but as a basic dimension of organizational life, Those who claim that people can be \"pushed\" into desired behavior, and \"pulled\" away from undesirable behavior by a good diSCiplinary system, may be claiming too much. Realistically, the entire management effort, informed by a constant feed\u00ad back from the \"managed\" and those served by the department, is the determi\u00ad nant of desired performance by officers. It is also beneficial to perceive all managerial efforts on a continuum from proactive to reactive and to consider diSciplinary events as reactive management actions. The implication is that the occurrence of reactive events can be reduced by relevant proactive efforts. Those who maintain a reactive posture tend to \"manage by activities\" dealing with disciplinary problems as they occur. Often, the result of action management is the inaccurate charging of the accused officer, lack of under- 7The terms \"organic\" and \"mechanistic\" are used to indicate types of organizations which differ in the way they cope with changing conditions. See T. BUrns and G. M. Stalker, The Management of Illllovatioll, 2nd ed. (London: Tavistock Publications, 1966). 8E. H. Schein, Psychology, (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hail, Inc., 1965), pp. 98-103. 8 DISCIPLINE PART OF THE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM standing by agency employees as to the nature and scope of the disciplinary process, and dissatisfaction within the rank-and-file regarding disciplinary proce\u00ad dures. These undesirable conditions stem from the agency's failure to establish a plan for dealing with disciplinary issues. On the other end of the con tinuum are those agencies which have devoted extensive resources and energies to design and plan for dealing with discipline. These agencies manage by objectives. They have internalized discipline as part of the administrative process and consider disciplinary management no less impor\u00ad tant than planning for manpower allocation and distribution, reviewing budgets, purchasing needed equipment, and other administering management functions. Their posture on management is proactive in that actions to meet anticipated and unanticipated occurrences are predetermined by a plan. In agencies utilizing management by objectives and results, there is a concentrated effort to define the results to be achieved from the disciplinary process and steps necessary to achieve pre-determined results. Police departments which manage disciplinary occurrences by objectives and results generally have a well-defined set of written directives which do not conflict with legal standards or prior labor agreements. The reason for such lack of conflict is that adequate research, both administrative and legal, is performed before a directive becomes final. Additionally, there is a high degree of accep\u00ad tance of directives by the rank-and-file because the officers have received ade\u00ad quate training and, therefore, understand (and have internalized) management expectations. Thus, disciplinary procedures are well-established, understandable, and accepted because the procedures have been rigorously planned prior to implementation. In the following chapters, the entire phenomenon of discipline as seen in police organizations is analyzed in the proactive frame of reference. It will be assumed that discipline is a dimension of management, not a technique or a system. However, the very act of analysis requires the use of labels and cate\u00ad gories. For ease of communication, it is necessary to refer to a disciplinary \"system\" and to discuss its parts. Additionally, some of the conclusions are in the form of rules and procedures. The analysis seems to produce the same kind of results as the \"mechanical\" approach to discipline; however, it should not be assumed that the 1atter is comparable or inevitable. On the contrary, there are important differences, which will become evident in the discussion. They lie both in the management processes by which these end products are reached in each organization, and in the ways these visible parts of the discipline \"iceberg\" are used. T 2 Structural Considerations in the Management of Discipline INTRODUCTION Chapter One emphasized that all segments of the disciplinary process should be considered as integral parts of the management system. Discipline should not be viewed as a distinct aspect of management, but rather as a part of the admin\u00ad istrative process which maximizes the realization of performance norms and minimizes the likelihood of undesirable behavior. Further, diScipline must be c.onceptualiz.ed primarily as a positive tool for modifying undesirable or poten\u00ad tIally undeSIrable behavior, rather than solely as a punitive mechanism for controlling behavior. . All d;isciplinary events should be analyzed from this broad perspective. The Impor~ance ?f .th~s conceptualization cannot be overemphasized. The manager who VI~WS dISCIplIne from a narrow perspective is destined to commit some very expenSIve erro~s. This is not to say that control and punishment are not impor\u00ad ~ant means wluch can be used to secure effective diSCipline. Before such action IS ta~en, 1.lOwever, it may be more reasonable to employ nonpunitive, behavioral modIficatIOn techniques to correct improper behavior. Such decisions should be based on the severity of the offense and results of previous nonpunitive measures. In many cases, the use of positive techniques wiII result in savings in human and monetary resources. This chapter discusses methods the police manager can use to move the ?rganization t~ward effective a.nd efficient diScipline. The chapter is primarily mtended to glllde the manager m deciding how diSCipline can be integrated into the total ~rganizational structure. Furthermore, it identifies and discusses neces- 9 10 MANAGEMEj\\IT OF DISCIPLINE, STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS sary conditions for effectively determining if employees are complying with management expectations-a necessary outcome for the realization of service delivery goals.! The major management focus should be on creating an environ\u00ad ment and system for the achievement of departmcntal expectations (perfor\u00ad mance norms) and decreasing the probability of unacceptable behavior. The manager can accomplish this by using available resources (moaey, material and manpower). A key to achievement, however, is careful planning. Included in this chapter are the following major topics: 1. Identification and Discussion of Organizational Considerations-This section highlights several organizational concepts deemed essential for a workable administrative process. The foundation for effective man\u00ad agement practices, both in the public and private sector, is based on the successful application of these principles to accomplish desired goals. This section attempts to apply these concepts to the disciplinary realm, and in doing so establishes a basis for understanding the disciplinary factors to be covered throughout the manual. The issues of direction and control are presented under organizational considerations, as well as the subjects of organizational goals and objectives, the problems of determining such goals and objectives, and means of diminishing these difficulties. 2. Written Directives-A review of written directives is presented to point out the importance of establishing a system of rules and general orders to move the organization toward a common goal. 3. Establishing Responsibility for Discipline within the Organizational Structure-A discussion of responsibility within organizational units is included. This section stresses the importance of identifying these entities, delegating authority, and ensuring control over operations. ORGANIZATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS Any treatment of management tools for an organization must first begin with a concept of the organization. It is essential to establish a basic understand\u00ad ing of the need and purpose of these tools. 1 Police agencies establish delivery patterns to meet the needs of the community. To serve effectively, each agency must establish goals and objectives for effective use of re\u00ad sources. If employees do not conform to management intentions, these goals and objectives will not be realized. '\\ !

People-individuals who populate the organizational structure, who are directed by the management process, using the technology to perform tasks in order to achieve organizational goals. These elements are necessary in private industry to produce and market products at a profit, and in the police agency to meet and service the needs of the community. The general task of management is to move these basic com\u00ad ponents of the organization toward a desired goal. The varied and multi-dimen\u00ad sional relationships between the components and subcomponents are, therefore, directed and controlled by the administrative process.5 While carrying ou t this process, management must take steps to ensure that performance norms are realized and the probability of undesirable behavior is minimized. To manage effectively and efficiently, there must be a logical approach to the management task. In discussing discipline, such an approach may be realized by defining goals and objectives of affected units, promulgating management expectations to gUide these units toward the realization of particular goals, and establishing a meanS to monitor performance to correct improper actions. Man\u00ad agement can, by implementing such a plan, deal with diScipline proactively and reduce internal and external dissatisfaction with the management task. The differences in management by activity (reactive management) and management by objectives and results (proactive management) are obvious. The latter is a more effective method of managing police disciplinary problems and other complex organizational problems, George L, Morrisey states that\" [MJ an\u00ad agement by objectives and results is a profeSSional approach to management that determines: L What must be done (after careful analysis of why it must J:te done), including establishment of priorities; 2.

Often, failure by man- gem en t to evaluate their program limits the realization of their goals. 14 MANAGEMENT OF DISCIPLINE, STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS ESTABLISHING GOALS AND OBJECTIVES One of the most important facets of police management, which is often overlooked, is the establishment of organizational goals. Frequently, goals are not easily identifiable because they are not stated succll1ctly. Additionally, \"goals\" and \"objectives\" are frequently used interchangeably due to confusion over their meaning. However, there is a difference in definition. The ends toward which tl'ganizations or individuals strive may be referred to as targets, purposes, objectives, goals or missions. In the context of police organizations, goals are those measurable end results toward which the total agency strives; objectives are those intermediate organizational achievements, usually accomplished by individual units, which when realized will cause the organization to reach its goals. Where objectives represent (Ill end, goals are best described as the end toward which the organization strives. The determination of goals for the total organization and objectives for each organizational entity is important to any discussion of disciplinary systems. Since goals direct the organizational effort, failure to achieve them generally means that the procedures established to reach the goals are not being followet or are being intentionally violated. In these instances, disciplinary processe& become operational. Positive measures may be taken in the form of retraining and counseling to correct inappropriate behavior; negative actions in the form of punishments may be used to induce compliance. There is, however, an often ignored or overlooked reason why these goals are not achieved. It is quite possible that at times goals may be either incorrectly stated or unattainable. Further, even if goals are realistically stated, the strategy to achieve them may be unworkable. In such cases, the disciplinary process should not be used, because the fault lies with the strategy-not the individuals. The organizational mechanism to identify faulty strategies and to make sugges\u00ad tions for appropriate modification is termed inspections and control (to be discussed later in this chapter). One function of goals and objectives, when transformed into work plans or strategies, is to provide stability and direction to the orgllnization. Stated by Leavitt, Dill and Eyring, there is a relationship between organizational stability, goals, objectives, and the task to be performed in order to reach these goals: One thing, however, seems clear: to the extent that an organization's tasks are operationally speCific, regular and predictable, the organi\u00ad zation is likely to generate a stl'uctlll'e that is specific, regular and predictable. If an organization knows not only what it is trying to Establishing Goals and Objectives do, but how and when it must be done, then we should expect its structure to evolve directly from that task, with authority and responsibility carefully allocated, and with pieces of the task care\u00ad fully cut up and assigned.? 15 Once such tasks are assigned, direction and control are simplified because mem\u00ad bers can be held accountable for task completion, and irregularities in perform\u00ad ance are easily identifiable. !he establishment of goals and objectives also provides management with a yardstJCk to measure performance of the entire organization and particular units. Such m~asures ~a: i.ndicate that the police agency is not reaching desired goals. As apphed. to dlsc~p!l11e, goals and objectives may direct the organization toward t~e resolutlOn of CItizen allegations of misconduct, the reduction in officer viola\u00ad tIon of rules, and the maintenance of directives which are current with the law and s~UJ:d employment practices. Feedback or measurements of such activities ma~ . mdlcate t~e need to alter goals or review the actions of organizational entItles responSIble for carrying out certain tasks. These entities may not be able to meet objectives for a variety of reasons. Management must ascertain these reason.s ~nd take appropriate action. Establishing any administrative process or ?Ommlt~Ing any agency resources without a stated goal can be wasteful and 11leffectrve. Example A primary ?oal of law en.forcement agencies should be the encouragement and prope: handlmg of complamts about the service delivery system. Or, stated n:ore precls~ly, the goal is to cre!lte an environment which is conducive to effi\u00ad CIent receptIOn, investigation, and resolution of all complaints against procedures and/or personnel, from both internal and external sources. Various org~niz~tional units must select and define objectives which guide th~ ~vera.U orga1l1ZatlOn toward the realization of this goal. A fundamental ~nncl.ple.111 managing by objectives and results is that the tasks perfGrmed by .rga1l1zatl~nal .. un~ts a:e directed toward the of the total organiza\u00ad tIon. If tlus pl1nclple IS followed, there exists a common direction of action and (Har 7HarBoid J. Leavitt, W. R. Dill and H. B. Eyring, The Organizational World court, race, Jovanovich, Inc., 1973), p. 16. 16 MANAGEMENT OF DISCIPLINE, STI{UCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS continuity of purpose. Since objectives form a basis for determining what activi\u00ad ties are to be performed, the objectives might be stated as follows: 1. To provide (x) hours of training to all members of the agenc~ by (date) on the need for a mechanism which a~equately provI.des for the reception, investigation and resolutIOn of complam ts against police personnel and procedures. Such training shall not exceed (y) dollars. 2. To provide (x) hours of training to supervis~ry. and comm~nd personnel by (date) on methods of investIgatmg complamts against police personnel and/or procedures at a cost not to exceed (y) dollars. 3. To decrease the tension and apprehensions associated Wi~h making a complaint against police personnel and/or procedures. Difficulties in Determining Goals and Objectives The determination of goals and objectives is a difficult undertaking :or several reasons. First, it requires the manager to plan for the future. Most polIce executives are striving just to keep pace with present problems. However, plan\u00ad ning and goal setting are essential if the organization is to resp~nd to the cha?g\u00ad ing dynamics of society. Thus, the administrator must be cognIzant of e:,olvmg conditions and accelerated rates of change. Management should prOVIde the techniques to gather and analyze information which may affe~t tl:e ~epa~t~ent. Tllis proactive planning will profoundly influence the organIzatIOn s abIlIty to deliver service. . A second difficulty, closely associated with the first, arises when modIfy\u00ad ing established goals to keep pace with changes i~ the environment. Managers may see the task of constantly revising goals as futIle because of the ever chang- ing nature of the law and community needs. .. . A police agency exists in a political and sO~lal env~ro~n:ent. As WIth any organization, it must adapt to the milieu. The actIOns o~ mdl~lduals and gro~ps, both within and outside the agency, may alter the relatIOnshIp of the orgamza\u00ad tion with its environment. Special interest groups demanding a better system of 8Note that objective three is stated in a different format than o~e a~d. two. There are some objectives which are subjective in nature. Subjective ends are stdl cntlcal: an? should ndt be overlooked. To do so would defeat the purpose of management by obJectives. See reference 5, pages 47-48, for a complete discussion. r;----\u00ad i Establishing Goals and Objectives 17 investigating citizen complaints seldom hesitate to pressure management for rapid change. Politicians responding to constituents often make stringent demands on the police executive. To illustrate, many police agencies investigate complaints brought to the department's attention by a politician more promptly and thoroughly than complaints made by a citizen. This situation is under\u00ad standable, but it clearly demonstrates the indisputable fact that complaints filed by someone with influence usually will be handled as priority items. Pressures exerted by the mayor, city manager, alderman, councilman or county commis\u00ad sioner will cause the agency to react more vigorously than if the average citizen registered the complaint. In at least five of the agencies analyzed during this project, interviews confirm that complaints received through the governor's office, the mayor's office, or other political entity were handled directly by the internal affairs unit, while other complaints were initially investigated at a lower level. There is reason to believe that similar practices are followed in the other agencies visited. Other pressures result from new or revised legislation, collective bargaining agreements, employee organization demands, and claims of citizen interest groups. Therefore, goals and objectives must be reviewed periodically and up\u00ad dated when necessary. While this task is not easily accomplished, it is an essential function in the administrative process. Such a task may be achieved by modify\u00ad ing present strategies or creating adaptive administrative systems to solve specific problems.9 Further, it is often difficult to implement strategies for achieving goals. Methods designed to achieve goals often are unrealistic or not feasible. The goal may be clearly stated, responsive to citizen interests, and consistent with all criteria of a well-stated goal, but procedures for achieving the desired ends simply do not work. Finally, employees who must carry out the process to achieve goals and objectives may disagree with them. In many instances, goals are developed by a manager or a staff person without consulting line employees. Whenever goals and procedures are imposed without input from those who must implement the workplan, there is a risk of opposition or protest. Dimillishillg the Difficulties. Problems in setting goals and objectives can never be eliminated, but they can be diminished. One way to reduce problems is to create a unit within the agency which senses both internal and external changes in the environment. These units, which are often referred to as organiza- 9p. M.

Organizational sensor~ are used to \"k~ep on top of things\"-a task designed to discover anticipated changes and determme how they will affect existing goals and objectives. Ideally, every officer is responsible for identifying changes. However, the following units have specific responsibilities as organizational sensors: 1. Legal Unit-monitors laws which affect the service deliver~ syst~~ and discipline, and makes recommendations as to the system s abilIty to function within legal guidelines. 2. Inspection and Control-identifies undesirable conditions which can be altered by new procedures or plans. 3. Internal Affairs-identifies and investigates misbehavior uncovered f:om external sources (citizen complaints), or internal sources. Also exammes conditions which are deemed to be undesirable. 4. Planning and Research-analyzes conditions pointed out by other organizational sensors and recommends procedures for improvement. 5. Training Unit-indoctrinates officers to management expectations, both at the recruit level and for veterans requiring in-service training. Specific involvement of these units will be discussed in later sections of this chapter. DIRECTION AND CONTROL An essential task in the administrative process is the direction and control of activities and behavior of people performing work. Dire~tion involves the creation and implementation of certain management techniques which establish the level of acceptable behavior and activity (performance norms). Once such expectations have been established and measurement is mad~ possible (per\u00ad formance evaluation), it becomes essential that controls be estabhshed to correct action or behavior which is deemed contrary to the established work expecta\u00ad tions (disciplinary system). As stated by Koontz and O'Donnell: The managerial function of controlling is the measurement and cor\u00ad rection of the performance of activities of subordinates in order to Direction and Control make sure that enterprise objectives and the plans devised to obtain them are being accomplished. It is thus the function whereby every manager, ... makes sure that what is done is what is intended. Some managers, particularly at lower levels, forget the principal of control responsibility that the primaJY responsibility for the exercise of con\u00ad trol rests in the manager charged with the execution of plans. I 0 19 The establishment of work expectations implies the development of organizational plans and goals. They are generally written directives issued by management to inform subordinates of the organization's policies, procedures and rules for attaining goals and objectives. Again quoting from Koontz and O'Donnell: Since control implies the existence of goals and plans, no manager can control without them. He cannot measure whether his subor\u00ad dinates are operating in the desired way unless he has a plan, how\u00ad ever vague or for however brief a period. Naturally, the more clear, complete, and coordinated plans are and the longer the period they cover, the more complete controlling can be. I I The day-to-day operations of a police agency are so complex that a sys\u00ad tematic procedure for issuing written directives must exist. Although this is true of all police organizations, it becomes especially true as the size of the agency increases and tasks become more complex. Since police operations are carried out over different periods of time and often are separated by geography, the agency cannot operate efficiently with outdated rules or oral transmittals which do not delineate management expectations. A police agency, without a proper system for disseminating policies, procedures and rules, will not reach its maxi\u00ad mum efficiency. Even a department with a high potential for leadership will suffer without a system of written directives to insure adequate direction and control. Lacking such a system, officers must rely on their own discretion in carrying out organizational goals.

P. 359. 20 MANAGEMENT OF DISCIPLINE, STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS THE WRITTEN DIRECTIVE SYSTEM In order to attain goals and objectives, management must establish workable procedures for documenting all expectations and advising individuals of their duties and responsibilities. The recommended format is a well-defined written directive system designed to move organizational components toward common goals and set the standard for acceptable behavior. Written Directives as a Management Guide Any analysis of disciplinary procedures must start with an intensive con\u00ad centration on written directives. Directives are the organizational tools which establish the level of expected behavior. The disciplinary process, both punitive and nonpunitive, is used when performance norms, as set by directives, are not realized and undesirable behavior is noted. The disciplinary process takes place generally when the procedures, rules and policies of management are not carried out, are misinterpreted, or are inten\u00ad tionally violated. To ensure understanding in complex police organizations, management must endeavor to have all policie8 clearly stated and understood. The potential for misinterpretation of administrative thinking grows as direc\u00ad tions flow from level to level. Police executives should ensure that directives are interpreted and carried out as intended. To achieve such control, each organiza\u00ad tionallevel of command must execute its duties accurately: the administrator's job is to determine goals and adopt policy; the commander's duty is to interpret these goals and establish objectives for goal achievement; the supervisor's task is to see that the work gets done; and operational personnel are responsible, in most cases, for carrying out tasks. Numerous administrative techniques are used in police agencies to achieve the desired level of understanding. The most common approach is to publicize expectations in some form of written directive, educate employees through recruit and in-service training, and seek some form of feedback on the practical application of policies and procedures. Through field research, it was determined that the quality of such management techniques varies substantially in different agencies. It was also found that these differences contribute to variations in officer perceptions of management's ability to make known expectations. Overall, those agencies which more clearly define orders and policies, more actively seek employee input in the administrative process, and more clearly explain expectations in training programs realize more positive employee percep-The Written Directive System 21 tions of managemen t techniques to make known expectations.! 2 Ostensibly, officers in these agencies will mor~ clearly understand all management expecta\u00ad tions.! 3 The lack of a standardized format for written directives creates confusion over expectations. In many agencies studied in this project, there is an absence of an agency-wide, easily identifiable, written directive system establishing management policies, procedures and rules. SOlT'e of these department~, for example, utilize civil service rules and regulations as organizational codes of conduct. Other agencies use department memoranda as a format for general orders, special orders, information transmittals, special announcements, etl.:. Officers in these agencies frequently have difficulty determining which direc\u00ad tives are most authoritative. Further, :n some agencies, the authority to issue a written directive is not controlled. It is important that unit commanders be authorized to issue written orders. However, directives from unit commanders should not be similar in appearance to those issued by the chief executive. Also, unit commanders should not be permit!.,} to issue written directives on subjects solely within the purview of the chief of police. It was found that several agencies encounter problems by issuing general orders in broad, lengthy documents, often outdated, which give the appearance of training orders. The problems caused by conglomeration of written directives are many. Officers are not only confused by inherently broad written directive systems, but in many instances view written directives as abstract and non\u00ad authoritative documents. In some departments researched, management's inability to issue clear, acceptable, and up-to-date directives has resulted in the union contract becoming the most au thoritative document on employee conduct. In this instance, man\u00ad agement authority is clearly underminec!. As stated by several officers in these agencies, the union has simply promulgated guidelines where management failed to do so. In as~essing the effectiveness of any organization's disciplinary system, it 12 A statistical difference was found (significant at the .001 level) between those four agencies receiving highest scores (top 25 percent) and those four agcncies receiving lowest scores (lowest 25 percent). For further infOlmation, see Appendix A, pp. 247-248. !3While this question was not researched directly in this project, interviews with em\u00ad ployees provide indications that more clear understanding was evident. AdditionnlIy, it W:lS found that better understanding of disciplinary procedures is evident in those agencies which more clearly defined these procedures (see p. 53). 22 MANAGEMENT OF DISCIPLINE, STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS becomes necessary to establish the initial conditions or basis for taking disci\u00ad plinary action, If such action is to be taken, the employee must have violated one of the expected conditions of employment. These conditions should be articuiated in a written directive system, Written directives serve as the foundation for effective discipline, By defin\u00ad ing parameters of acceptable behavior, these documents provide official notice of management's position on enforcing the law, Also, management policies, when transformed into written procedl.lres, furnish a standard of conduct for those who perform daily police operations, The foundation provided by direc\u00ad tives helps limit the potential for abuses of police discretion. As recommended by the National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals: Every police agency should acknowledge the existence of [this] broad range of administrative and operational discretion that is exer\u00ad cised by all police agencies and individual officers. That acknowl\u00ad edgement should take the form of comprehensive policy statemen ts that publicly establish the limits of discretion, that provide guide\u00ad lines for its exercise within those limits and that eliminate discrimi\u00ad natory enforcement of the law, Policies should be developed to guide or govern the way policemen exercise this discreiion on the street. 1 4 Designing an Effective Directive System The following factors should be con~idered among basic requirements for an effective written directive system: 1. Only the chief should have the authority and responsibility to promul\u00ad gate directives which delineate departmental goals. The directives generated by the chief generally have agency-wide implication and should be issued lIsing a readily identifiable, distinctive format. The c!lief may also issue directives in tended specifically for one organiza\u00ad tlOnal unit or a specific group of individuals, but mllst issue such directives in a format other than that intended for agency-wide distribu\u00ad tion (memorandum or inter-office letter would be appropriate). 2. Mid-management and organizational entity commanders have the . 14Nati?nul Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals, Report Oil PO/ICe (Waslllnglon, D.C.: GPO), p. 21. The Writtell Directive System 23 responsibility and authority to promulgate written directives which explain methods of reaching the applicable unit objective (thus, direct\u00ad ing the unit toward attainment of departmental goals), 3. Management expectations must be clearly delineated if employees are to be held accountable for carrying out assigned tasks. 4. All employees, regardless of assignment, have the right to know exactly what is expected of them, To avoid a conglomeration of written directives, management must cate\u00ad gorize ,jirectives by particular purposes. While some directives are authoritative in that they define \"do's and don'ts,\" others are informational. Directives are divided into five types in this review: rules and regulations, policies, procedures (including general orders and special operating orders), instructional material, and memorandums. Rilles alld Regulatiolls. These directives are designed to cover situations in which no deviations or exceptions are permitted, The essence of a rule is its inflexibility. A rule, properly enforced, applies equally to all persons, Policies, These directives are general statements which guide the organiza\u00ad tion and its employees in the direction of organizational goals, Policies may be viewed as those directives which represent an overall plan for the organization, As stated by Koontz and O'Donnell: Policies delimit an area within which a decision is to be made and assure that the decision will be consistent with and contributive to objectives. Policies tend to predecide issues, avoid repeated analysis, and give a unified structure to other types of plans, thus permitting managers to delegate authority while maintaining control.15 Policies permit some discretion, but are generally supplemented by procedures which make the policies operational. Procedures. While policies are general guides, procedures are specific guides. Procedures are written directives which describe expected methods of operation. Procedures generally permit some flexibility within certain con\u00ad straints. Since they have organization-wide application, they cut across organiza- IS Koontz and O'Donnell, p. 56, , , --------.:I 24 MANAGEMENT OF DISCIPLINE. STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS tiona I entity lines and must. therefore, be promulgated under the authority of the chief executive. There are two forms of procedures: 1. General Orders/Standard Operation Procedures-These are permanent procedural directives which can be modified only by the authority of the chief execu tive and are in effect un til so altered or superseded by another order. 2. Special Operating Orders-These are intended to define specific policy and direct procedures for special situations or events. These orders cover temporary situations and are self-cancelling once the situation ceases to exist. hlstl'lIctiollal Material. These directives are intended to expand 011 the purpose and reason for rules or procedures. Training bulletins, fOl example, are often an extension of standard operating procedures and rules. Ordinarily, disci\u00ad plinary action would not result from the violation of a training bulletin or other instructional material. If a particular bulletin is found to describe proper methods of behavior, it should be re-issued as a rule or procedure. Memoranda. These directives are designed to either inform or inquire, or to direct. Memoranda are personal in nature and usually addressed to one person or a restricted number of persons. Memoranda are utilized to disseminate infor\u00ad mation or instructions which do not warrant a formal order. They are also used to explain or emphasize previously issued orders. Several other considerations must be addressed when preparing written directives. Planning and coordination are essential to meeting each of these tests. Policies, procedures and other written directives should not be derived hastily. All possible negative ramifications of issuing directives should be identified before dissemination. Several key considerations are presented in the following, with recommendations offered for ensuring thoroughness in the management of the written directive system. Directives Must Be Legal. Currently, many rules or procedures are partially or totally contrary to law or to the prevailing trends of the courts. This is par\u00ad ticularly true of those directives which are not periodically revised in accordance with court decisions. When there are clear indications from court decisions that a particular directive may be overruled, if challenged, it would be foolish to invite such contest. During field work, it was discovered that most legal advisors (or city, county, or state attorneys) review written directives only when asked to Tile iVritten Directive System 25 do so, or when an existing directive is challenged through legal action. To be effective, legal advice should be sought prior to implementing the directive. To avoid conOict between the proposed directive and the law, thorough research should be undertaken to determine legal views on the particular subject. Departmental legal units should research statutes and cases which may cause conflict. All directives should be reviewed periodically by the legal unit. or the city. county or state attorney. The cost of doing business without legal input can be high. Dil'ectivps ShOUld Be Acceptable to Those Affected. It is often difficult to obtain acceptance to directives. At times, unpopular directives must be insti\u00ad tuted to achieve organizational goals or objectives. Employee perceptions of these directives vary according to several factors, including amount of conflict between the employee organization and management. Some agencies with a high degree of sociali7ation of employees enjoy a basic commitment to the agency and its goals, and a Willingness to accept the authority of management decisions. In other agencies, conflict reigns between employees and police management, as well as between groups of employees. Successful methods have been applied in several orgQnizations to reduce this conflict. One of the most appropriate techniques is to increase subordinate input in the management system and in decision-making. Use of this technique can enhance employee acceptance of written directives and instill more confi\u00ad dence in the administrative system for obtaining feedback from lower level personnel. One of the organizations studied was especially solicitous of officers' opinions. The department's chief executive periodically visited officers in their homes to discuss department policies and procedures, as well as controversial issues. In this department, 87 percent of the officers surveyed stated that rules were fair as written (compared with an average of 67 percent for sixteen departments surveyed). Nearly 70 percent of the officers surveyed in this depart\u00ad ment indicated that they felt free to suggest new or revised written directives (compared with a sixteen-department average of 49 percent). Officer perceptions of agency standards of conduct were also researched during this project to determine the degree of acceptance of traditional standards. Specifically, the intention was to measure officer perceptions of dif\u00ad ferences in codes of conduct for officers and civilian employees, and for officers and the public at large. Overall, it was found that officers readily accepted these differences. It was also determined that higher scores were obtained in those agencies in which management had given a full-scale commitment to publicizing T I 26 MANAGEl\\fENT OF DISCIPLINE. STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS the explaining standards. 1 6 This finding gh\"s credence to assumptions underly\u00ad ing an additional technique for obtaining acceptance, management should strive to apprise both employees and citizens of acceptable standards. Officer perceptions of rules and regulations were also analyzed.1 7 Officers in each agency were asked to give impressions of fairness of each rule as written and as enforced. While higher agreement was noted for written rules than rules as enforced, some problems are evident. Officers are most critical of rules which restrict their behavior while off duty, specifically rules on hairstyles, off-duty employment, residency, and personal debts. Additionally, officers indicated that many of the rules were too broad or vague to be properly enforced. Rules to which greatest disagreement of this type was apparent are those involving criticism and insubordination. The important finding in this analysiil is that police agencies must modify existing rules, in many cases, to realize full commit\u00ad ment by employees to agency norms. Directives Must Be Understandable. Another difficulty in preparing direc\u00ad tives of all forms is to make them understandable. A good directive must clearly and explicitly state management intentions to avoid misunderstanding. The directive must avoid vague language which can result in several interpretations. The consequences of vague directives can be seen in many court decisions in criminal cases, and in police employee challenges to managemen t decisions. Two levels of understanding must be considered when preparing written directives. The first is that of transmitting to the reader the concept of the directive. The reader must understand what management wishes to accomplish by the directive. The second requires the order to be sufficiently explicit to tell the reader the expected behavior. During the IACP field work for this project, questionnaire analyses showed that officers did not feel that all directives offer this second level of understand\u00ad ing. The follOWing two questions were asked: (1) \"Written directives in this department generally are stated so that I can understand them.\" In 16 depart\u00ad ments, 83 percent of respondents agree with the statement, 7 percent were 16 A statistical difference (significant at the .001 level) was realizeJ between the four agencies in which highest scores were obtained and the four organizations receiving lowest scores. It is difficult, however, to identify reasons for this difference. A t best, this finding must be defined as inconclusive. For further information, see Appendix A, pp. 234-238. 17Pourteen rules were analyzed including those prescribing agency policies on off\u00ad duty employment; operation of police hairstyles; mustaches courtesy public; late duty; moral conduct; insubordination' personal debts; criticism department; use of alcohol off duty; gratuities; and residency: For further information, see Appendix A, pp. 199-212 for percentages of responses, and pp. 252-259 for analyses of results by agencies. The IVrittell Directil,e System 27 uncertain, and 10 percen t disagreed. (2) \"Written directives are stated so that I have a good understanding of what is expected of me.\" Officers responded in the follOWing manner: 70 percent agreed, 13 percent were uncertain, and 16 percen t disagreed. The responses from 2,058 police officers indicated that with few excep\u00ad tions, directives were understandable as written. However, officers tended to feel less sure about directives setting forth prescribed conduct. The 16 percent negative response to the second question above, coupled with 13 percent who were uncertain, indicat\"d an unoesirable condition. Thus, while 83 percent agreement to the first question indicated basic understanding of the directive as written, the decrease in the number agreeing in the next question indicated less confidence regarding expected behavior in work situations. A related finding is that many officers did not understand disciplinary procedures, including the role of the internal affairs unit, the internal review process, the method of receiving and investigating complaints, and the procedure for outside appeals. It was found that greater understanding was evident in those agencies which more clearly delineated such poliCies and thoroughly covered them in training progran1s.1 8 The failure of officers to understand these expectations was quite apparent in three departments visited by the IACP. In one organization which was operating under 12-year-olcl rules and regUlations, 56 percent of the respondents stated that directives did not clearly delineate expected behavior. The adminis\u00ad tration in this organization had told officers continually for fouf years that a new manual was to be issued. Increased confusion among line officers resulted from this failure to promulgate the manual. In other departments where under\u00ad standing of expectations was low (45 percent and 30 percent either disagreeing or expressing uncertainty to this question), employee manuals were outdated and practically useless in the management system. In other organizations visited, officers were quite satisfied with the direc\u00ad tive system. In two organizations exhibiting adequate directive systems, for example, understanding was quite high. One agency in particular, which uses a well-defined directive system, realized very favorable responses as to officer comprehension of directives. The message for administrators from this analysis is clear-many rules and directives are not understood by employees. This inadequacy poses a dilemma 18 A statistical difference (significant at the .001 level) was found between the top four departments on this measure, and the lowest four agencies. Further information Oil this finding may be obtained frCJm Appendix A, pp. 229-234. I ---- --- ------- --------------- 28 MANAGEMENT OF D1SCIPLlNE, STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS with ramifications for the entire disciplinary dimension-how can employees be disciplined jf they are not adequately informed of expected behavior? Directives Must Be Currellt. If directives are to be a useful tool for moving the organization toward goal attainment. they must be kept current. Unless directives which control the operations of the agency are up-to-date, there will be a strong possibility that some existing operations will be outdated and perhaps illegal. Police administrators must adapt organizations to meet changes in society and in the law. There are several methods which can be employed to assure that directives are kept current. First, it is important that the agency formalize and establish a policy and procedure for purging, updating and revising directives. Generally, there should be a total review of all directives on a semi-annual basis. This procedure should ensure that outdated and conflicting directives are purged or altered. All directives must be examined for conflicting statements that result in an uncoordinated and incompatible system. The majority of the seventeen agencies studied had no regular procedure for reviewing, updating and purging of the written directive system. Directives were examined on an \"as needed\" basis, and generally only when conflicts occurred. The difficulty with this reactive approach is that outdated directives often go unnoticed until violated. Obviously, this could cause considerable embarrassmen t to the agency. Stalldards and Controls 011 the Directive System. To be useful, a written directive system must be controlled. The directives must be prepared and issued in a rational manner and must be recognized by employees as authoritativ3 instruments. In some agencies studied, officers complained that they could not keep up with the many directives issued; they did not know which ones were the most important. They also complained about the constant changes and revision in directives and generally felt bogged down by the \"papermill.\" Obviously, ~mployee confusion and complaints in these agencies could be minimized by an Improvement in the quality of the written directive system. To further illustrate the need for a controlled written system, in three d~partments where officer opinions regarding the fairness of written directives were the lowest, two salient characteristics were noted: the department's manual was outdated (in one case, it had not been revised since it was issued fourteen years preViously), and/or department members did not recognize it as authorita\u00ad tive in matters of conduct and discipline. Authority to issue directiJles must be controlled. Not everyone in the organization can be authorized to issue all fO~l11s of directives. Although this The Written Directil1e System 29 may appear to be an obvious statement, many agencies fail to control the issuance of directives, often resulting in a conglomeration of documents. The authority of the documen ts will be questioned and often directives will contain conflicting orders and instructions. Those in supervisory positions must have a uniform means of transmitting directives to individuals in their command. Not all of these directives have equal weight, and must be issued in a manner so that the impact is known. Authority in an organization is an important tool for moving toward goal attainment; directives must reflect that authority. Police agencies should devise a system for issuing directives by the variolls levels of authority. This system should be docu\u00ad mented to avoid confusion. Directives which affect the total department must be distinctive from an others and must be issued only by the chief executive. No unit commander should be permitted to sign a directive or use a format which has not been approved by the head administrator or as stated earlier, which appears to be similar to the type of directive issued by the chief executive. Direc\u00ad tives pertaining to individual organizational entities should be issued by the commander of the unit, provided there is no conflict with agency-wide rules or procedures. Five different forms of directives were previously identified in this chapter. It is recommended that only the chief executive of the agency have the :IU thority to issue policies, rules, general orders, and instrllctionalmaterial. These directives have agency-wide applications and, therefore, must only be issued by one person. A classification and numbering system. Many police agencies issue direc\u00ad tives without regard to a system of classification and numbering. As a result, directives are not ted and maintained in chronological fashion. Thus, when reference to a parc ... \"lar directive is desired, it becomes necessary to search the entire volume of directives to locate the one sought. This inconvenience dis\u00ad courages employees from using the directive system ful!y and supports the often-heard complaint that directives are confusing. The most common error of this type noted by the IACP occurs with general orders. Such directives carry the same force and authority as agency rules and regulations, but are issued more frequently and should be revised more often. Because general orders are extremely important and iSSlled with slIch fre\u00ad quency) it is important that a system for easy classification, retention, and acceSSibility be established. One method of classification, which was encountered in field research, is to group the orders into separate categories and assign a consecutive master number to each category. One agency used this system and divided general 30 MANAGEMENT OF DISCIPLINE, STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS orders into the following seven categories: Administration, 1.0; Communica\u00ad 5.0; Patrol, 6.0; and Traffic, 7.0. This department categorized general orders by frequency of usage and the organizational entity most directly affected. For example, the general order which explains and delineates the agency's written directive system comes under Administration (1.0) because it relates to administrative matters. Other general orders found in the administrative category include practices and procedures relating to transfers and promotions, overtime, diSciplinary procedures, etc. Likewise, orders dealing with departmental correspondence, radio procedures, telephone usage, and other communications would be found under master num\u00ad ber two (2.0), Communications. The agency consecutively numbers each general order; the general order number is preceded by the master number. Thus, the first general order in the administrative category is 1.1, and subsequen t general orders are identified as 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, etc. Two ingexing methods are needed for the above described procedure. First, there should be a sequential index to identify directives. The format of the index would be as follows: No. Date File Code Subject 1.I 3/14/73 Adm Departmental Written Directive System 1.2 9/18/70 Adm Budget Procedures 1.3 2/12/74 Adm Promotion and Transfer Procedures 1.4 5/13/75 Adm Disciplinary Procedures 1.5 5/12/74 Adm Grievance Procedures 2.1 4/20/74 Comm Departmental Communication 2.2 5/15/75 Comm Radio Procedures 2.3 5/ 2/70 Comm Telephone Procedures In this index, when revisions are necessary, general orders are superseded. The updated orders are assigned the original index number with the new date indi\u00ad cating its revision. Therefore, dates are not necessarily consecutive in this index. A second type of indexing is an alphabetical listing of general orders. This system enables the employee to identify the location of the order by its com\u00ad mon title and then determine the order number. Thus, if officers need to refer to the order on disciplinary procedures, they would find the title order in the index and turn to order number 1.4. Several departments visited by the IACP made use of such a system. The Written Directive System 31 Distribution of directives. Occasionally, officers contend that they have not received copies of directives. The claim might b~ legitimate because the officer was not present during distribution due to illness, vacation, or other reasons. To hold an employee responsible for the contents of an order when such order was never received is unfair. Also, if the agency takes disciplinary action for noncompliance, the officer may successfully challenge the charges on this ground. A distribution scheme must be developed to assure that everyone affected by an order receives a copy. One method of achieving this is to hold supervisors responsible for distribution of all directives to all subordinates. In such an ap\u00ad proach, the supervisor is given sufficient copies of the order with a control list containing the names of all subordinates. When the order is distributed, each subordinate is required to sign the control form next to his or her name indi\u00ad cating receipt. If a subordinate is not present during distribution of the order, his or her absence will be readily apparent. Distribution is not complete until each subordinate receives and signs for the directive. An alternative system which places primary responsibility on the indivi\u00ad dual officer is used in one agency visited. Officers receive copies of new written directives in their mailboxes and every six months receive a memorandum listing all written directives promulgated during the preceding six-month period. The officer is responsible for obtaining all missing directives, copies of which are available at the personnel office. Each officer must then initial a receipt for all issued directives. Once the directive is distributed, its contents should be explained to the officers clarifying any ambiguities and possible misinterpretations. Most police departments explain orders at lineup or roll call so as to indoctrinate everyone at the same time. This system, based on IACP field work, does not achieve full understanding of directives. Usually, time at roll call is too limited to explain practical applications of rules. Furthermore, first-line supervisors often are not well versed in instruction methods. Many supervisors convey the impreSSion that they are only completing a tedious and unimportant task. As a result, officers may feel that such directives are not importan 1.19 Programs can be implemented which enhance employee understanding. In one agency visited, officers were assembled one-half hour early to explain new rules and general orders and to give practical examples. At the conclusion of this half hour, officers were quizzed about their knowledge of all new or revised 19 A further discussion of supervisory techniques in explaining directives will be pre\u00ad sented in Chapter Four. 32 MANAGEI\\IENT OF DISCIPLINE, STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS policies. This system, of course, may require that overtime pay be allocated for participating officers. However, these funds would be well spent on such a program to ensure officer understanding of written directives. Training 011 Written Directives. All officers should be thoroughly indoc\u00ad trinated in directives which establish agency expectations. This training should start in recruit school and be continued through periodic in-service training sessions.2o The typical police agency spends a great deal of time in recruit school discussing matters such as laws of arrest, firearms proficiency, and other operational concerns relevant to the actual performance of tasks. These pro\u00ad grams, however, are usually deficient in their explanations of rules of conduct and in discussions of discipIinalY procedures. This condition arises partly from time constraints, but even more directly from insufficient emphasis being placed on such matters. Of the seventeen agencies studied, only a few devoted more than cursory coverage to these subjects. In several departments, they were covered in as little as four hours. This situation is unacceptable in contemporary law enforcemen t. New officers may be apt to in terpret certain rules as they see fit, particularly if they are not instructed in all details of specific policies. With the increase in court chaIlenges of department standards of conduct, police organizations must exer\u00ad cise caution in making certain that officers are instructed on proper conduct. Lack of instruction is a concern to police officers, as confirmed through questionnaire analysis. When responding to the statemen t, \"My recruit training gave me a working knowledge of written directives,\" 37 percent of the total sample disagreed (either disagree or strongly disagree), 11 percent were uncer\u00ad tain and 50 percent agreed (either agree or strongly agree). The 37 percent negative score together with the 11 percent uncertainty presents an undesirable condition in that 48 percent of all respondents were not confident that expecta\u00ad tions were made known through training programs. In several of the organizations studied, over 50 percent of the officers responded negatively to the above statement. Tn those agencies in which extreme negative responses were indicated (over 60 pe!\\;ent), recruit programs contained only four hours of instruction in rules and procedures. By contrast, in one agency where 45 hours are devoted to instruction on rules and procedures, only 14 percent of the respondents indicated disagreement with the above statement while II percent were uncertain and 74 percent agreed. The significant relationship between number of hours devoted to training 20 Tn-service training sessions as discussed in this section refer to formalized proorams and not to roll call instruction. '\" Establishing Responsibility 33 on rules and procedures and the degree to which such training provides a working knowledge of directives should be considered in curriculum planning. In several departments studied, officers received extensive training through state-level law enforcement training programs, but little training in their indivi\u00ad dual departments. In all of these departments, responses to tile question on recruit training were more negative than the sixteen-department average. Obviously, individual departments should supplement such state-wide programs with instruction sessions that explain the department's rules of conduct, proce\u00ad dures, and penalties. If it is accepted that training and instruction on departmental expectations are necessary to develop in new officers a cogni::ance of their role, then it follows that such instructions must in fact reflect the actual and current thinking of the agency administration. If the teachings in the police academy are not curren t and reflective ,)f I )1e chiefs policy, the instruction given will be im\u00ad proper. Therefore, unless there is constant revision in the lesson plan which treats administrative policy. ~'; 'JCedures and rules, the instruction offered is mis\u00ad leading. To avoid transferring such incorrect information to officers, the following approach should be taken: 1. Departmental expectations (rules, procedures and policies) must be written and continually revised and updated to reflect changing condi\u00ad tions and needs. 2. Instructional lesson plans should be developed and be based on the written directives promulgated by the agency administrators. 3. The lesson plan should be submitted to the chief executive of the agency for approval. Such approval signifies acceptance of the training format and instructional content. ESTABLISHING RESPONSIBILITY WITHIN THE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE To carry out disciplinary tasks successfully, responsibility must be dele\u00ad gated to individual units within the agency. The disciplinary dimension is multi\u00ad faceted; the organizational structure should consist of several separate entities responsible for performing diverse functions. This is not to say that each func\u00ad tion will be carried out by a large specialized unit. In some cases, pJimarily in 34 MANAGEMENT OF DISCIPLINE, STRUCTURAL (,ONSflJERATIONS smaller agencies, one individual may have responsibility for completing such tasks. However, the concepts governing opera tion of these units are similar in all police organizations, for even in small departments there is a need to maintain certain skills beyond those necessary to perform operational tasks. This section is devoted to a discussion of four principal organizational units or groups of individuals given responsibility for undertaking disciplinary functions: the immediate supervisor, the internal affairs en lity, the inspections unit, and the training unit? 1 Each of these plays a vital role in the management of discipline. The key to successful operation of each is that tasks be clearly defined so that individuals responsible for certain functions, as well as the organization as a whole are aware of what the tasks are and how they should be carried out. It is imperative that definitions be specific enough so that the total meaning and requirements of the tasks are understood. Immediate Supervisor:! 2 Every supervisor has a responsibility for knowing and practicing the proce\u00ad dures established by the organization to deal with employee behavior which is contrary to expectations. Most police organizations have established some procedures to deal with violations of directives. If the ~upervisor fails to follow these procedures, he or she is not conforming to expected behavior patterns and should be subjected to some type of corrective action. One of the most important functions of the administrative system is that of direction. Direction is defined here as a process of guiding or regulating the total resourceS of the organizational entity through motivation, leadership and communication, and is an implicit task of supervision. Such direction is effected through formal written directives, verbal directives, and interpersonal relation\u00ad ships between supervisors and subordinates. Leadership is an important element of direction. Leadership involves instilling within all members of the agency the will and enthusiasm to act individually and collectively toward the attainment of the agency's goals. 21 Whereas this chapter is primarily concerned with defining responsibility for each of these units or individuals, later chapters will discuss in greater depth practical problems encountered by each entity in processing disciplinary cases. .. 22~hi~ discussion of immediate supervisor's responsibility applies to all levels of super\u00ad VISIOn wlthm the agency. A more detailed analysis of each level's responsibility together with common problems typical to many police organizations will be presented in Chapter Four. Establishing RespollsibiLity 3S It is important to recognize, however, that leadership can occur only when each member of the agency who is in a position of authority understands the responsibilities and knows the limits of authority to complete assigned tasks. Although the levels of authority vary within the hierarchy of the organization, the failure to carry out responsibilities at any level will render the organization ineffective. The previous quote from Koontz and O'Donnell is worth reiteration: Some managers, particularly at lower levels, forget the principle of control responsibility that the primary responsibility for the exer\u00ad cise of control rests in the manager charged with the execution of plans.~ 3 The necessity for the organization to adequately delineate agency expecta\u00ad tions through written directives has been previously emphasized. Additionally, it is important to stress that supervisory personnel must provide the impetus for directing manpower and other agency resources toward attainment of those expectations. To provide such direction, supervisory personnel must be granted proper authority to carry out such responsibilities, and by the same token must be held accountable for the completion of such tasks. To be functional, super\u00ad visory activities must be: 1. Legally authorized 2. Departmen tally authorized by written directives 3. Understood by everyone in the agency. The task of clearly delineating responsibility and authority is the first step to effective supervision. Also important is the agency's responsibility to provide adequate training to new supervisors and periodic in-service training to expe\u00ad rienced suptrvisory personnel. A new supervisor cannot be expected to read, digest and successfully practice the concepts and responsibilities associated with the new role withou t proper training. An older, more experienced supervisor (or command officer) cannot (and in some instances will not) keep abreast of changes affecting supervisory functions in the management system without ill\u00ad service training. Experience has shown that inadequate amounts of supervisory authority, as well as insufficient training in administrative skills and responsibilities creates 23Koontz and O'Donnell, p. 359. ---I 36 ~IANAGEMENT OF DISCIPLINE. STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS problems of role confusion affecting disciplinary situations. This is true particu\u00ad larly with first-line supervisors. Increased training for supervisors is one answer to this inadequacy. In one department studied, supervisors received regular in\u00ad service training in supervisory skills. Questionnaire responses show that officers' evaluations of the performance of supervisors in this department were consis\u00ad tently more positive than the average in sixteen departments surveyed. Although the sergeants' rank represents the first step into the managerial system, these administrators are often not considered and used by mid-or upper\u00ad management (lieutenant and above) as part of the management team. Likewise, operational level personnel (patrolman rank) may often fail to view sergeants as managers, but simply as supervisors. Thus, decisions made by first-line super\u00ad visors are often subject to criticism by employees above and below the sergeants' level of authority. This problem is compounded if the first-line supervisor's role, responsibilities, and commensurate authority are not clearly delineated. In such instances, disciplinary action taken by the first-line supervisor is a discretionary decision which often results in inconsistent disciplinary practices. If, for example, one sergeant is lackadaisical in enforcing a particular regulation while another enforces it rigorously, employees may view discipline as being arbitrary and inconsistent. Such a condition often produces morale problems and impedes achievement of organizational objectives. Another problem arising from inadequate supervisory instruction is incon\u00ad sistent recommendations for punishment, or a complete lack of action. If such problems are identified, it is imperative that causes be discovered and remedial action be taken. Internal Affairs Unit Many police organizations, especially larger agencies, have found it advisable to create specialized entities within the organizational structure to dr-al with defects in the service delivery system. Deficiencies of many types, including citizen complaints against employees or against procedures, are often handled and resolved by these units. The first type of specialized unit is that of internal affairs. Internal affairs has as its major function the receiving and processing of complaints made against employees or procedures. It also maintains staff control over such complaints. This is a necessary task in police organizations, since actual operations may falI short of ambitious efforts to realize intended goals. The most sensitive function of internal affairs is the investigation and reporting on complaints of alleged mis\u00ad conduct or violation of policies, procedures, and rules by police personnel. Establishing Responsibility 37 The existence of an internal affairs unit to deal with false or inappropriate behavior on the part of police personnel in the service delivery system should be well documen ted for the benefit of citizens and staff operating within the system. The effectiveness of the police organization is based largely on its integrity and reputation-both must be beyond reproach. A police agency cannot afford public doubt regarding its forthrightness and trustworthiness. Likewise, police employees must recognize that the behavior and method by which they deliver police service is continually scrutinized by members of the public; and when their behavior falls short of the public's and the department's expectations, they will be subject to investigation and subsequent diSciplinary proceedings. For this reason, it is imperative that all police agencies establish a stable, uniform and totally unimpeachable system for investigating complaints against the agency or any of its employees. In prevIOUS sections, the need for the administration to promulgate rules, regulations and procedures del;neating agency expectations has been established. If it is brought to light that these expectations are violated or that existing procedures are contrary to changing service delivery needs, the agency must determine the extent to which existing practices are undesirable and alter its present operation. In this regard, the internal investigation system of the agency is designed not only to deal with employee misconduct, bu t also to deal with complaints against the outdated and sometime ineffective system and process being utilized by the police agency. As stated in the National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Stand\u00ad ards and Goals: Complaints from the public provide the police chief executive with invaluable feedback. These complaints, whether factual or not, increase Ius awareness of actual or potential problems and assist him in his use of problem-solving techniques as well as providing him with another basis for evaluating the performance of his agency? 4 In essence, progressive police executives should welcome complaints from the public to determine where the existing system falls short of its intended goals. LikeWise, and equally important, a chief executive should welcome COIll\u00ad plaints about officer behavior (and misconduct) so that subsequent diSCipline, both punitive and nonpunitive, can be initiated. No doubt sllch a policy will result in frivolous and often false accusations. The frivolity and inaccuracy of 24Nutionnl Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals. p. 471. J 'I' 38 MANAGEMENT OF DISCIPLINE, STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS the complaint, however, should be determined early in ~he .investigatory ~rocess, and should not be used as a justification for discont1l1umg or hampermg the complaint reception process. A strong and responsive internal investigation entity is an indispensable part of the police administrative process. Its clear existence in the organizatiOI~al structure gives notice to both the public and the employee that the pol~ce agency is willing to \"police its police.\" Additionally, a clear and c?mpr~hens1Ve written directive delineating the process and procedures for dealmg wIth both external and internal complaints eliminates the possibility that allegations made against the police service delivery system might not be invest~gated. ~oreo:er, .it decreases the possibility that individual officers may use theIr own dIscretIOn III disposing of this vital citizen feedback. Again, quoting from the National Advisory Commission on Justice Standnrds and Goals: It is clearly in the interest of police chief executives to initiate effec\u00ad tive change in their administration of internal discipline. Otherwise, public or police employee groups, or court decisions in civillitiga\u00ad tion, may force executives to follow a course other than the one they would have chosen, and thus diminish their control over the agency.25 The investigation of alleged employee misconduct must be based on sound investigative principles and formal, written and understandable policies, proce\u00ad dures and rules. To be effective, the internal investigation unit and disciplin\u00ad ary system must be based on legal authority. This legal authority should be specified in the written procedure delineating the system. The disciplinary system should be based on sound management principles, current administrative law, and-to a certain extent\u00ad societal attitudes .... Police agencies must maintain a disciplinary system compatible with administrative law. The legal unit of the local jurisdiction, the police agency legal advisor, or management publications should provide the police chief executive with current information which he can use to administer internal discipline? 6 Since legal authority, societal attitudes, and management principles are 25National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals, p. 470. See also Rizzo 1'. Goode, 423 U.S. 362,96 S. Ct. 598 (1976). 26Nationat Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals, p. 470. f \\ ,..1 Establislzillg Respollsibility 39 dynamic, ever changing states of affairs, the need to revise the promulgated investigatory and disciplinary system of an agency is obvious. If court decisions, new legislation, improved management techniques or the demands of society make existing procedures outmoded, the procedures must be altered. It is, there\u00ad fore, imperative that the police executive develop an awareness of changes which may alter the existing diSciplinary and internal investigation system. When such changes are made, they should be reflected in the written directive system which outlines the disciplinary procedures and internal investigation process for the department. In essence, not only is the initial establishment of the internal disciplinary and investigatory system formalized, but subsequent changes also become a part of the administl'ative process. Unless accomplished, this critical and sersitive function will be viewed with distrust by both officers and civilians. The diSCiplinary system functions only when departmental requirements and expectations are not adequately met or if rules, regulations, procedures, and established policies are intentionally violated. Although the police service delivery system can never function perfectly, the extent to which it meets its objective of serving with the least complaints from the citizenry is a criterion for measuring effectiveness. If, however, the me~hanism for receiving complaints is cumbersome or nonexistent, the improper actIOns of officers cannot be measured. Moreover, unless improper operations are acted upon, the fa!'lty system will only perpetuate itself. Measures which indicate problems in the service delivery system (or im\u00ad proper officer behavior) are derived from the following two sources: citizen report of dissatisfaction, and supervisory action for violation of rules and regulations. If the agency sincerely wishes to know about every complaint regardless of its severity, complaints must be documented. There fo ff. , there must be a formalized method of receiving complaints and adequate measures of assuring that such complaints are received. The mal'ltenance of complaint files and ~tatistical compilation relating to complaints ~hould be the responsibility of the ll1te~n~ affairs unit. TJlis information should then be fed to management, speclfYlllg the type of misconduct occurring most frequently and possible reasons for this misconduct.2 7 . 27In some agencies, the responsibility for maintaining such records rests with the mspe~tions un!t. This chapter recommends that the internal affairs and inspections units establIsh workmg channels. of comn:unication so as to best identify organizational problems to. management. The phYSICal 10catJon of the complaint file in this analysis (whether it be with the internal affairs or inspections unit) is of secondary importance to the establishment of workal;le relationships between these units. -. .1 40 MANAGEMENT OF DISCIPLINE, STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS The basic purpose of internal investigations is to establish the truth .or falsity of complain ts against police officers and other members of the ~ohc.e agency. It is also the responsibility of this unit to see that each complamt IS documented and that established procedures are followed, ~ega~dless .of the degree of seriousness of the alleged infraction. Unless this functlOl~ I~ spe~lfically authorized by management and made an integral part of ~he adnlln~stratl:e pro\u00ad cess, there will be no assurance that all complaints are recorded and 1I1vestlgated. The function and responsibility for internal investigations must be codified in written procedures. Unless this responsibility is ~nder~tood by each emp!oyee, the police delivery system is jeopardized and the 111 tegnty ?~ ~he agen~y IS ~u~\u00ad ject to groups. Currently, the .responslbllIty of th.ls UI11t IS not well understood in many agencies, and there IS a great deal of discontent and suspicion over the role of the internal affairs unit. The fact that the internal affairs entity assumes primary responsibility for receiving, documenting and investigating allegations of misc?nduct .do~s. not mean that this task is not shared by other organization~l UI~ltS and 1I1~1V1~ual officers. The sensitive task of self-inspection and jnvestiga~lOn IS an orga111za tlOn\u00ad wide responsibility, with staff control for such functlOn~ dele.ga.ted to tl:e internal affairs unit. Since this responsibility applies to all offICers, It IS necessat~ that the police agency issue a policy statement explaining the reasons for tlus posture. The following policy statement is provided as an example: A proper relationship between the police an~ the public. they serve, fostered by confidence and trust, is essentIal to effectIve law en\u00ad forccment. Police officers must be free to exercise their best judg\u00ad ment and to initiate action in a reasonable, lawful and impa~tial manner without fear of reprisal. Concomitantly, they must metICu\u00ad lously observe the rights of all people. The appreciation of this philosophy imposes upon :he Depal:t~en.t the responsibility of providing a system of complal11t and dlscl~lI\u00ad nary proct:!dures which will not only subject the offic~r to correct~ve action when he conducts himself improperly, but wIll protect lum from unwarranted criticism when he discharges his duties properly. It is imperative, therefore, that adequate provision be ~ade for ~he prompt receipt, investigation and disposition of complamts regard1l1.g the conduct of members and employees of tlle Department. To tlus end, the Police Department welcomes from the people of the com-h'stablisllillg Respollsibility munity constructive critici',m of the Department and valid com\u00ad plain ts against its members or procedures. This order sets forth the purpose, organization and fUnction of the Internal Affairs Section, prescribes duties of personnel in processing complain ts and explains the disposition of sustained co.nplain ts. 28 Inspections Unit 41 The basic need of any manager is knowledge that the plans of the organiza\u00ad tion are implemented and carried out as intended. It is necessary for all adminis\u00ad trators to know if behavior is, in fact, consistent with written directives. Such stated rules and policies are plans which articulate the overall goals and objec\u00ad tives of the agency. These directives are powerful instruments for action. However, individual or unit behavior not in conformance with such directives has the effect of inhibiting achievement of all expectations. The manager must have some method of detecting this undesirable behavior. The task of detecting such defects should be delegated to the inspections entity. There are several tasks which lllay be Carried out by the inspections unit: ]. Determining if all procedures are being followed; 2. Discovering if existing methods are accomplishing the agency goals, and if Hot, why; 3. Determining if a procedure needs to be altered in order to better meet agency goals. The crux of the inspections function is to see that employees and material are performing adequately to meet stated goals and objectives. In essence, the primary responsibility of the inspections unit is the timely review of procedures, materials, and personnel. The creation of an organizational entity specifically responsible for the inspections function depends on several factors, including such tllings as the size of the agency, the complexity of the task to be accomplished, and the degree to which employees in the police agency are motivated toward abiding by estab\u00ad lished organizational procedUres. In small agencies, it is generally safe to hold unit commanders solely responsible for the inspection of personnel procedures and material under the commander's control. Their failure to correct inade- 28This statement provides an example of one department's policy for handling citi\u00adzens' complaints. \\ I., I, , i' i, .

In these departments, the chief of police generally performs the overall inspection function. In large agencies. however, the inadequacies and improper inspection of personnel, material, and procedures can often go unnoticed for extended periods of time, resulting in serious conse- quences. The need for a well-staffed and effective inspections unit was often ignored in departments studied. Many agencies had no inspections unit at all, while others had units which were understaffed or improperly utilized. One department so ineffectively utilized its inspections unit that it assigned its senior commanders to the unit as a means of \"putting them out to pasture,\" Another agency had an inspections unit listed on its table of organization, but the unlt was assigned no personnel. When an inspectional services entity is created to perform this function, it should report directly to the chief of police. The sensitivity of the inspections function necessitates a direct line of communication between that unit and the chief. The inspectional services entity should be commanded by an individual of unquestionable integrity and of sufficient rank to achieve inspectional objectives, In some instances, it may be practical to include under the direction of one commander the internal affairs function and the inspections [unction, because both perform similar tasks, This, however, is a decision best made by the agency, If the two functions, internal affairs and inspections, are not grouped under one commander, there must be a willingness on the part of both com\u00ad manders to coordinate their activities closely since both work on matters of mutual interest. The inspections unit should perform the following major duties: 1. Procedure evaluation 2, Material resources evaluation 3. Evaluation of responses to calls for services and the reporting system 4, Determine by actual on-site inspection whether the policies of the man\u00ad agement are being complied with by personnel at the operating level. The purpose of procedure evaluation is to insure that the work of the organization is conducted within the established policy framework. This neces\u00ad sarily presupposes that written policies and procedures truly reOect the view\u00ad point of the administration. A thorough inspection of each organizational entity is necessary. To this end, procedure evaluation should be accomplished on a \" 1 Establisllillg Respollsibility scheduled basis so that inspections I . unit is neglected, are p aImed and tImely, and insure that no Inspection ullit personnel should critical! established procedures to insure that the roce Yu compare ?erformance against accomplished througll the revI'ew f d p. . d res are bell1g followed.

Also discussed were management tools for creating a discipline system, This chapter focuses on the component parts of the discipline system, with special emphasis on the pror!:dures and processes involved in taking disciplinary action. The discussion will deal with the elements of the discipline process in rough sequential order; that is, in the order in which the various steps will take place during the course of a typical diSciplinary action. While the process may be Simplified or streamlined for minor infractions, each of the elements discussed should be included in any major case. The elemen ts to be discussed are the following: (1) establishment of standards and rules of conduct, (2) establishment of mechanisms f01 detecting violations, (3) intake of misconduct complaints, (4) assignment of responsibility for handling complaints, (5) temporary and emer\u00ad gency suspensions, (6) investigation, (7) charging, (8) resolution, (9) imposing sanctions, and (10) appeals. Discovery of internal police records has become a subject of great concern to police administrators. Therefore, at the end of the chapter, this matter will be explored in some depth, Discovery of persoJlnel and internal affairs records in climinal prosecutions and in civil litigation are treated separately because the development of case law in these areas has proceeded under differen t theoIies. 45 46 DISCIPLINE PROCEDURES AND PROCESSES THE DISCIPLINE PROCESS Defining Proper Behavior Any discussion of police diccipline is premised on definitions of what is and is not acceptable behavior by police officers. Before a police department can discipline an officer for misconuuct, it must have clearly defined, preferably in writing. what constitutes misconduct. There is a legal maxim which holds that there is no crime unless it has been created by law (\"nullum crimen sine lege\"). The same holds true for administrative disciplinary action. An officer may not be disciplined for action which the officer has not been informed is prohibited, nor for omitting an action which has not been required. The problem, in its current context, is best illustrated by the practice (found in many police departments) of including many unspecified offenses under the charge of \"conduct unbecoming an officer\" or \"conduct tending to bring the department into disrepute.\" Several recent judicial decisions have shown that such broad language is too vague to sustain a disciplinary action against an officer for any conduct not specifically, efined as \"conduct unbecom\u00ad ing.\" Bence 974), cert. dellied 419 U.S. 1121 (1975). Other courts have ruled that \"conduct unbecoming\" is an appropriate charge when because of common knowledge or department practice, the off1c,~r knew or should have known that the conduct was proscribed. Perea J'. Fales, 114 Cal. Rptr. 808 (Ct. App. 1974). These all inclusive rules are a source of great concern to many police officers. Of all officers surveyed by the IACP, 70 percent agreed with the neces\u00ad sity for the conduct unbecoming rule and believed that it should be included in written directives.! Interview results also demonstrated that officers are aware of the need for such an inclusive rule. A department is not prohibited from evaluating an officer on general performance characteristics and recording the evaluation in a personnel file. The data in such files need not relate to violations of specific rules but may be a gen\u00ad eral assessment of performance. However, if there is to be a penalty imposed for a specific act, the act must be defined as prohibited conduct. A major consideration in establishing rules of conduct is that they be designed for a particular purpose. To include a rule simply because it relates to I Officers were asked to respond to the statement \"the rule on conduct unbecoming should be included in written directives.\" Responses were as follows: strongly agree (22 percent), agree (48 percent), uncertain (12 percent), disagree (10 percent), and strongly disagree (8 percent), The Discipline Process 47 condur,t traditionally prohibited b tl is not a rational decision.

Another important tool for detecting violations is the citizen complain t process. Many departmental policies govern officer interactions with citizens. Supervisors may not always be present to monitor such events. In these cases, feedback concerning the propriety of officer actions will be obtained only from citizens who believe they have been treated improperly. While an officer's written reports may give some indication of failure to follow proper procedures, not all misconduct can be detected through this process. The department must maintain and rely upon an effective citizen complaint procedure to actively seek feedback regarding officer compliance. This procedure ~l!( uld be designed to \"protect the integrity of the force, to protect the pubLc 1. [,erest, and to protect the accused employee frol11 unjust accusation.,,3 In this sense, the complaint sys\u00ad tem should serve two ends: A properly administered complaint review system serves both the special professional interests of the police and the general in terests of the community. As a disciplinary device, it can promote and maintain desired standards of conduct among police officers by punishing-and thereby deterring-aberrant behavior. Just as impor\u00ad t?Dt, it can provide satisfaction to those civilians who are adversely affected by police misconduct.4 Other mechanisms for detecting violations of departmental procedures are the inspections unit and the internal affairs unit. While the inspections unit is primadly concerned with detecting procedural deficiencies within the depart\u00ad ment, it is also effective in discovering system malfunctions due to individual error or inefficiency. The internal affairs unit is primarily responsible for con\u00ad ducting investigations of misconduct allegations. As such, it does not necessarily \"discover\" the misconduct, but does confirm the existence and details of mis\u00ad conduct, and thus serves as a key element in detecting violations of departmental rules. The citizen complaint systems of seventeen agencies were assessed through IACP field research by interviewing members of the media and representatives of community groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union, Blacks, 3N.

They may be brought by citizens who believe they have witnessed or suffered from officer misconduct or may be brought by fellow officers or supervisors. Complaints of officer misconduct must be afforded the same degree of serious consideration as reports of criminal offenses. It is neces\u00ad sary that there be an established formal procedure for handling such complaints. Most departments have a system by which a supervisor may report misconduct by his subordinates. However, in some departments, the system for receiving complaints from citizens is inadequate.s Lack of an efficient procedure for intake of citizen complaints detracts from the credibility of tlle department's commitment to thorough investigation and correction of misconduct. On the other hand, the existence of a fomul com\u00ad plaint procedure provides a much needed \"safety valve\" against the explosive effects of a law suit alleging widespread toleration of misconduct. Also. a com\u00ad plaint procedure gives the department added feedback as to what kind of job its officers are dOing. The procedures themselves must be designed so that they are not so complex or burdensome that they diScourage the filing of complaints. For example, a requirement that a citizen must appear in person at police head\u00ad quarters (which in a large city or state agency may be miles away) in order to file a complaint is unreasonable. A telephone call or a trip to the local precinct should suffice to initiate the complaint. If it is necessary to speak to the com\u00ad plainant in person, an officer should go to the complainant's home or office. The following specific factors should be considered in developing an efficient complaint intake procedure. Simplicity. As mentioned above, overly burdensome procedures are to be avoided. Some departments intentionally make things complicated, bt'lieving that \"minor\" complain ts will thereby be deterred or discouraged. While there certainly is a need to screen out frivolous complaints early in the system, this should be accomplished at an initial investigatory stage rather than by discourag\u00ad ing complaints. The requirement of a sworn or notorized statement to initiate a complaint is another example of an unreasonable deterrent, as is the requiremen t of a statemen t of willingness to submit to a polygraph. Each of these steps may be appropriate at Some later stage of the complaint investigation process, bu t SThrough the administrative analysis, it was ascertained that in several departments Complaints may not be reduced to writing and as a result will not be followed by investi\u00adgations. 5:1 DISCIPLINE PROCEDURES AND PROCESSES none should be used as a prerequisite to the mere filing of a complaint. Though a citizen's complain t may appear frivolous or unfounded, it is important to document the citizen's concern. The citizen who takes the time to report an incident generally considers the alleged act important and expects the department to respond in some manner. Perhaps the expectation of a full-scale investigation is not on the citizen's mind, but some degree of attention and responsiveness by the department is anticipated. One step in fulfilling this expectation is showing the citizen that the complaint is being doc1Jmellted. In many departments studied by IACP, minor complaints were not do::umented, but were handled infom1ally. Often, this procedure resulted in citizen dissatis\u00ad faction, and in one department, it produced a rash of complaints from the community that the chief executive was insensitive to citizen concerns. With a simple complaint reception report, citizen complaints, both minor and major, can be recorded with a minimum of time and effort. Such recording will not only satisfy the citizen but will also provide the agency with docu\u00ad mented feedback to be used later for evaluation of the service delivery system. Citizen complaints, even those which might appear frivolous, provide this needed data. Also, such reports help to counter accusations that the department is not responsive to citizen allegations. Additionally, such documentation can later be used to justify budget, manpower or other resource needs. Benefits to be derived from this procedure were articulated in one agency's general order on the citizen complaint process: It is to the benefit of each member of this Department that every complaint registered by a citizen be taken courteously and recorded. Even if the complaint is known to be unfounded and a simple ex\u00ad planation of a procedure completely satisfies the citizen, that com\u00ad plaint could be a part of a justification for future budget requests for public education or information personnel. All complaints by citi\u00ad zens, real or imagined, are an essential item of required information. Familiarity. The department should endeavor to familiarize the com\u00ad munity with the basic steps necessary to file a complain t against the police. A system should be established to assure that all complaints are received by the appropriate officer. All officers should be familiar with proper responses to citizen complaints. One method of assuring that citizens are familiar with their right to register complaints is for the department to announce its policy publicly. Many departments prepare policy statements which inform the employees that com-The Discipline Process 53 plaints will be accepted and investigated, but few make this policy known to the general public. Those departments that do make known procedures have pre\u00ad ?are~ brochures or letters which state the citizen's right to file a complaint and Identify how su~h a complaint I~ay be filed. An example of this statement from one department Illustrates the pOlnt:9 The police department has recognized the fact that its officers are responsible to the public for their conduct. At certain times a con\u00ad flict may exist between a citizen and a police oft!cer in the perform\u00ad ance of his duty. If you believe that a police officer has violated your rights in the performance of his duty, you should bring it to the attention of the on-duty supervisor of the officer being complained against. The supervisor will discuss the matter with you; and if the discussion r~veals that a complaint is in order, he will assist you in the prepara\u00ad tIon of the complaint form. The initial contact may be made by telephone, letter, or a personal visit. B~ sure to give all the information concerning the incident, ll1c1uding wItnesses. Many details which seem small at the time may later prove to be of great value in the investigation. All valid complaints will be investigated per department procedures. After the investigation is completed, you will be notified of the results. This information has been prepared as an effort to promote better understanding between you and your police department. Steps should also be taken to assure officer understanding of disciplinary procedures. While one might assume that officers possess such understandin a survey results indicated that an aVerage of only 57 percent of the office;~ res~onding understood their department's procedure for receiving citizen com\u00ad plalll~s. In on~ depdrtment, only 41 percent of respondents expressed under\u00ad stanchng, and 111 another only 43 percent of those oft!\\.:ers surveyed understood procedures. Furthermore, in several departments where minor complaints were ~ummarily handled without investigatiom, 45-59 percent of the officers respond\u00ad lIlg thought that all complain ts, no matter how minor, were investigated in their departmen t, and in one department, where only written complain ts were 9Tn order t? obt~in. maxim~m this d~purt';1ent also pnnts thIS InformatIon 111 Spumsh.

In analyzing diffelences across agencies, it was found that greater officer understanding was evident in those agencies which more clearly docu\u00b7 mented policies on citizen complaint procedures and internal diSciplinary matters.10 These results indicate that agencies should devote more efforts to familiariZing officers, as well as citizens. Records and Forms. Forms should be provided for filing a complaint which will permit efficient collection of all necessary information. The initial complaint form should be designed to accommodate complaints (both internal and external) of alleged infractions by police employees, as well as those which relate to departmental policy or procedure. In designing a complaint form, the following points should be considered: Q The form should be designed so that all recording of information can be accomplished in a minimum amount of time o Sufficient information must be captured on this form to assure follow\u00b7 up if necessary o Pertinent data from the source document should be easily retrievable in order to permit identification of undesirable trends or conditions \" Sufficient copies should be prepared so that the information will be distributed to appropriate persons and organizational units I) Each complaint should be recorded on a central log in order to facili\u00b7 tate processing the complaint and to assure follow\u00b7up. Notification. As part of the complaint intake process, citizen complainants should be told that they will be notified of the outcome of complaints. It is necessary that citizens know what happened to their complaints, and what action was taken by the department as a result of the complaints. If there is no feedback from the department to citizens, they will lose confidence in the ability of the department to handle its own problems. Many police agencies fail to notify the complaining citizen of the results of the investigation, while others have developed elaborate means of keeping the citizen informed. Generally, it has been found that those agencies which person\u00b7 10 A statistical difference, (significant at the .001 level) was found between those four agencies in which officers indicated the greatest understanding (top 25 percent), and those from which officers expressed the least understanding (lowest 25 percent).

The Disciplille Process 55 ally contact the complainants and discuss the investigation and adjudication have a better relationship with the ccmmunity.ll One such agency, studied in this proje.ct, sends the .c~mplainant a letter acknowledging receipt of the complaint, and mforms the cItIzen that the allegations arc being investigated. Further, the le~te~ states tl,lat th~ citizen will be advised of the results of the investigation wltllln a cert.am pen?d. of time (generally tbree weeks, depending on workload).

You will be advised of the results of the investiga\u00ad tion in approximately three weeks. Very truly yours, Chief of Police Once the investigation is completed and a finding determined the com. plainant is notified of results. Such notification may follow two fo;ms: if the complaint is sustained, the citizen should be apprised that the agency does not condone such action and that corrective action will be taken. An example, in the form of a letter to the complainant, is provided below: Date Name Address City, State Zip Code R IINational Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards aI\" Goals eport 011 Police (Washington, D.C.: GPO, 1973), p. 478.

The Discipline Process If you desire further information in regard to the investigation or dispOSition, please contact the Internal Affairs Office, (telephone number and extension). Very truly yours, Chief of Police 57 Notification to citizens should not be a \"once-in-a-while\" practice. It should be established and codified in the written directive which explains the department's complaint procedures. Referring again to one department studied, a general order states: As the investigator receives the case folder, he or she shall imme\u00ad diately cause a letter to be sent, acknowledging the receipt of the complaint to the complainant. In cases where completion of investi\u00ad gation is delayed, an additional letter will be sent to the complainant with the assurance that the investigation is continuing. These letters shall be over the Chiefs signature and copies of the same will be maintained in the case file. A record of these letters shall also be recorded on the worksheet within the case folder. Where police departments fail to provide adequate procedures for handling citizen complaints, unrest and dissatisfaction in the community sometimes lead to legal action against the department. Courts are usually reluctant to interfere in police internal affairs. The latest statement on judicial noninterference in disciplinary systems was issued by the United States Supreme Court in January 1976. Rizzo )!. Goode, 423 U.S. 362, 96 S.Ct. 598 (1976). The federal trial and circuit courts had directed the department to draft for the court's approval a comprehensive program for dealing with civilian complaints to be formulated in accordance with the court's detailed guidelines for reviSing police rules and procedures for handling citizen complaints. The United States Supreme Court, reversing the lower courts, held that the plaintiffs had not proven an affirmative link between the occurrences of various incidents of police misconduct and the adoption of any plan or policy by the department authorizing or approving the misconduct. Also, the Court decided that the plaintiffs lacked 1l personal stake in the outcome of the case; they had. failed to establish the necessary case or controversy. The Court ruled that the lower courts had exceeded their authority and had intruded into the discretionary authority of the police administrators, The ----~-----------~ 58 DISCIPLINE PROCEDURES AND PROCESSES Court reasoned that the alleged acts which constituted a violation of individual citizen's constitutional rights were so few in number that there was no justifi\u00ad cation for the trial court to find a pattern of an unacceptably high number of incidents. The twenty incidents, conceded to be violations of constitutionally protected rights, did not establish a pattern of violati()J1s of constitutional dimension in a city of three million inhabitants with 7,500 police officers. However, the Court did not entirely foreclose federal judicial interference in internal departmental procedures. Plaintiffs in future litigation may prevail if they demonstrate a pattern of an unacceptably high number of incidents and a departmental policy responsible for such pattern. How many incidents of mis\u00ad conduct and how active the department must be in authodzing or approving the misconduct before a federal court will take jurisdiction of the case is left to future litigation. Handling Complaints Once a complaint is received by the department, decisions must be made as to how it is to be handled. Departmental written procedures should spell out most of the <lnswers in this area. Some of the more difficult issues which must be addressed are the following: 1. Under what conditions should a complaint be referred to internal affairs for investigation? 2. Under what conditions should the first-line supervisor be responsible for investigation, and/or assessing punishment? 3. To whom should inspections refer a systems problem? 4. When should the supervisor refer a case to internal affairs for further investigation? 5. When should a case be referred to the district attorney for possible criminal prosecution?! '2 111vestigatioll Responsibility: Division of Work. A question to be addressed in dealing with the investigation of allegations is the division of work. Should the internal affairs unit be responsible for the investigation of every complaint coming to the department's attention, or should some investigations be referred 12'For a more complete discussion of the effect of criminal prosecution on adminis\u00ad trative discipline, see page 68. The DisdjJ.'fne Process 59 to the commanding officer of the organizational entity against whom the alleged personneJ or service complaint is lodged? If, for example, it is determined that citizens are dissatisfied with response time, and the fault lies in the dispatch process, should the communications section be responsible for discovering the conditions and solutions relating to the difficulty? If an officer assigned to the patrol division is the subject of a discourtesy complaint, should the patrol divi\u00ad sion have the responsibility of investigating the officer's actions? Logically, the answer to these questions depends on the following: 1. Who is in the best position to determine the facts honestly and without bias? 2. Who is best qualified to institut,\u00b7 \"lange? 3. Who ha<; time available to investigate the allegation? When an allegation of a relatively minor nature comes to the attention of the agency, .it should be the responsibility of the officer's immediate supervisor to investigate the truth or falsity of the allegation. Incidents of major proportion should be assigned to internal affairs for investigation. In either case the internal affairs unit should maintain staff control over all ongoing investigations. In many instances, the complaints made by citizens are against agency policy and procedure rather than against an officer. It often happens that an officer, in responding to a call for service, arrives at the scene only to find the citizen gone or extremely irate over the length of time which it took the officer to respond. In these cases, the compJaint of the citizen is well-founded and such information is valuable in determining defects in the service delivery system. In these Situations, fault does not lie with the officer if he or she responded to the call upon receipt or at the earliest possible time. The cause of the defect may be improper manpower al1ocation, dispatch procedures, or a failure to prioritize incoming calls for services. Regardless of the reason for the defect, a citizen who is discontent with the level of service should be permitted to register a complaint. The officer on the scene is in the best position to capture this information or, if the citizen chooses, he or she may complain to head\u00ad quarters. The point is that the citizen should in no way be dissuaded from making such complaints. The willingness of the department to accept such com\u00ad plaints clearly demonstrates the agency's responsiveness to citizen complaints. Furthermore, this feedback provides evidence which can be used to justify resource requests if it is determined that !Such resources might increase the level of service. 60 DISCIPLINE PROCEDURES AND PROCESSES The division of work required to resolve procedural, proCp.ss or service delivery system complaints is straightforward. The investigation and subsequent recommendat:ons for change should be the responsibility of the unit carrying out the functional responsibilities most closely related to the complaint. For example, a citizen complaint about the failure of detectives to adequately follow up on an incident that is determined to be the fault of the report processing or workload should be turned over to the detective division to ascertain the cause of the backlog and methods of eliminating it. If the communication process is not effective and results in a lengthy response time, the communication section should investigate the procedure and devise ways to decrease the response time. Although this concern might appear to deal with situations beyond the scope of a disciplinary study, experience indicates that many complaints against police officers arise from an inefficient process which does not maximize the department's capability to deliver police service promptly and effiCiently. This type of fact finding should be coordinated with the inspections unit as dis\u00ad cussed earlier in this report. Internal Investigation Unit: Investigations and Staff Control. Staff control implies a centralization of the internal investigatory function of the organiza\u00ad tion. Such centralization is required regardless of where in the organization the actual investigation is conducted. Thus, even though an investigation of alleged officer misconduct is performed by a supervisor, the internal affairs unit should have knowledge of the ongoing investigation and maintain pertinent depart\u00ad mental records relating to the action. As stated previously, the basic purpose of internal investigation is to estab\u00ad lish the truth or falsity of complaints against police officers regardless of the seriollsness of the alleged infraction. In large police organizations, this procp.dure can become a complex task which requires administrative safeguards to assure that all complaints are properly handled. It should be clearly understood that the purpose of internal investigations is to examine, consistently and critically, all areas of police action which repre\u00ad sent potential hazards to the integrity of the agency. Misconduct should be discovered as qUickly as possible so that prompt corrective action can be ini\u00ad tiated. In order to perform the in ternal investigation function, appropriate staffing is needed to assure that the workload can be effectively and efficiently performed. A suitable office, a records storage area, and an interview room will be required. The office should preferably be located away from the general flow of foot traffic, but not hidden in an undesirable part of the police building. The location of the Internal Affairs office should provide easy access to citizens. Some agencies have found it advantageous to place the internal affairs operation The DiSCipline Process 61 in the same general area as administrative offices, i.e., chief or deputy chief. This stresses the im portance of the unit to citizens. The internal investigation unit should receive, process and file all com\u00ad plaints lodged against police employees, as well as establish and maintain abso\u00ad lute control of the conduct of investigations and all records pertaining thereto. Acces~ to internal investigations files should be limited to those having a legiti\u00ad mate need for such access, as defined by departmental regulations.13 The internal investigation unit should maintain an internal investigations control log, with complaints against officers transmitted to personnel in charge of the control log. After logging, complaints should be referred to the appropriate investigating officer, who may be in one of the line units or a member of the internal investigation unit. All records of investigations should be filed by number only, with access through an alphabetical master name index. The master index card should contain only the name of the officer, victim, com\u00ad plainan t or witness, and the file number. All files, including the master name index, should be locked when not in use. Desks should be provided for all personnel, and all work papers and notes should be locked when the office is vacant. Unmarked vehicles should be allocated for internal investigations personnel. Complaint investigation involves (1) formal investigation by members of the internal investigation unit of complaints against any personnel, and (2) staff supervision of complaint investigations conducted by line commanders. Line commanders should be aware of their individual and collective responsibilities in the areas of disciplinary control, and in investigation of complaints of mis\u00ad conduct against their subordinates. The special investigations function involves confidential investigations affecting agency personnel. These investigations should be initiated only at the direction of the chief of police. Such investigations may arise as a result of official complaints lodged against an officer or may be of internal origin and have no connection whatsoever with an external complaint. Investigative work may have to be carried (Jut covertly at times. For this reason, security precau\u00ad tions should be observed during active investigations. The unit's administrative duties should also include the preparation of investigative summaries on a regular basis so that an accurate record may be maintained, not only of the total number of complaints received, but against whom they are J1l1.de, and how often an officer is the subject of a complaint. 13State freedom of information acts may contain provisions governincr access to and the release of these files. '\" i~ I' 1\\ ;,J', ' ---~ 62 DISCIPLINE PROCEDURES AND PROCESSES Quite often, patterns of irregular behavior will be discovered that otherwise might have remained undetected for a long period of time. The internal investigation unit should also keep a suspense file of inves\u00ad tigations which have been referred to line supervisors. Investigators should advise appropriate commanders if investigations are delinquent or inadequate. Additional administrative functions should include the preparation of a response by letter, in person, or by telephone to those who contacted the police with complaints concerning real or imagined abuse of police authority or mis\u00ad conduct. Officers against whom complaints have been lodged should always be informed of the complaints unless doing so might jeopardize the ensuing inves\u00ad tigation. Officers should also be informed of the results of the investigation. Officer morale in these instances is just as important as the need to satisfy the civilian complainant. Traditionally, many police agencies have overstressed the importance of maintaining internal satisfaction as opposed to citizen conii\u00ad dence.14 Administrators must develop practices which achieve both of these objectives in order to realize sound discipline. From IACP experience, it is clear that many agencies have difficulty in finding the correct formula for achieving these objectives. Perhaps the major reason is that departments do not sufficiently define the duties of the internal investigations unit and supervisors. Many agencies researched did not require staff control by internal affairs over investigations, did not clearly delineate the responsibilities of this unit as opposed to supervisors, and failed to notify all complainants of the receipt of a complaint, as well as its final disposition. Suspensions Suspellsions Pending Further Action. It is common to provide in dis\u00ad Ciplinary procedures for the temporary relief of an officer from active duty, pending some further processing of the case. Such a suspension is distinguished from a suspension imposed as a pun,ishment following a final determination of misconduct. The temporary suspension is generally, but not always, with pay. If without pay, and the officer is later exonerated, the officer is usually entitled to back pay. The purpose of such a suspension is generally to assure that the officer is available at all times to participate in any investigation or hearings which may take place, to relieve the officer from th!! burden of daily work while under the 14T1\u00b7 \" 1 . 115 SituatIOn maya so serve ;lS a detnment to control of police corruption. See Herm;ln Goldstein, \"Administrative Dilemmas,\" Police Corruptioll-A Perspective on its Nature alld COlltrol (Washington, D.C.: The Police Foundation, 1975), p. 32. --~~----~----------- The Discipline Process 63 strain of an inVestigation, and to avoid any embartassment or conflict which might arise from the continued service of an employee who is accused of, or charged with misconduct. In some departments and under some circumstances, a line officer under investigation may be maintained on active status, but transferred to an adminis\u00ad trative or staff assignment, such as communications. Or the officer might be attached to the inspections or internal affairs diviSion, and instructed to remain at home and/or report perindicaHy. Normally, this situation occurs when the investigation and resolution process is expected to be concluded quickly. It is not necessary to hold a hearing prior to initiating a temporary sus\u00ad pension; under proper circumstances an officer may be summarily suspended or relieved from active duty. Wilson v. Minneapolis, 168 N.W.2d 19 (Minn. 1969); Cain v. Civil Service Comm'n, 411 P.2d 778 (Colo. 1966), cf., Arnett v. Ken\u00ad nedy, 416 U.s. 134 (1974). However, due process requires that the officer be given a right to a hearing before any permanent disciplinary action is imposed. Perry v. Sindermann. 408 U.S. 593 (1972), unless the' officer serves at the will and pleasure of the appointing authority. Bishop v. Wood, 426 U.S. 341 (1976). Effects of Suspension. As indicated earlier, the normal result of 110 suspen\u00ad sion is to interrupt an officer's right or responsibility to perform his or her regular duties. A suspension may include a total revocation of the officer's police power, or it may be limited to an order not to report for work_ The department official ordering the suspension normally may attach any lawful conditions deemed fit, so long as his or her power has not been limited by departmental rule. In some cases, departmental rules specify that a supervisor may relieve an officer from duty for only one day or for one work period; suspensions for a longer period require action by the chief, as do prohibitions of caring of firearms, exercise of arrest power, etc, Generally, a suspension is given in the form of a direct order to the officer. Violation of the terms of the suspension, e.g., carrying a firearm after being ordered not to do so, may constitute a further violation (e.g., disobedience of an order). Duration of Suspension. A suspension is, by its nature, temporary. A permanent suspension would amount to a dismissal. A suspension may, however, be open-ended, and need not be imposed for a specific period. A \"suspension until further notice\" is proper. Also, a suspension may be set by its tern1S to expire at some future specified time, or upon the occurrence uf some event, including an event within the control\u00b7 of the suspended officer. For example, an officer may be suspended pending the outcome of a criminal prosecution against the officer, or until he or she complies with an order to terminate improper out-:! ,~}, --.;a ~ ---~--- - ----- -------~----- 64 DISCIPLINE PROCEDURES AND PROCESSES side employment. See generally, Romanowski v. Board oj Education, 213 A.2d 313 (N.r. Super. 1965). Suspensio1l Without Pay. Police officers may be suspended without pay pending final disposition of the case. Adams v. Rubil1ow, 251 A. 2d 49 (Conn. 1968); Arnett v. Kennedy, supra. Normally, officers later acquitted on miscon\u00ad duct charges are reinstated with full back pay, but not necessarily. Graham p. Asbwy Park, 174 A.2d 244 (N.J. 1961). Salary earned from other sources during the suspension may often be deducted under the doctrine of \"unjust enrichment.\" Also, if officers are cOIlvicted of misconduct, but the verdict is later set aside or reversed on appeal, they may not be entitled to back pay. Snider 1>. Martin's Feny, 260 N.E.2d 129 (Ohio Ct. App. 1970). Finally, if the charge of misconduct is upheld, disciplinary action may be imposed retroactively to the date of the offense, and any temporary suspension may count as part of the final punishment imposed. Investigations Perhaps the most critical aspect of any police internal diSCipline process is the investigation of an allegation of misconduct. More can go wrong at this stage, and with more serious consequences, than at any other point in the process. As with any investigation, the department must, using lawful procedures, gather all evidence pertaining to the allegation, so that a good faith decision may be made, whether to dismiss the complaint or continue with the charges against the officer. The investigation must be seen by the community, and by members of the department as diligent and impartial. A decision to exonerate an officer or to sustain a charge against the officer based on faulty or incomplete evidence will antagonize one party or the other, and detract from the credibility of manage\u00ad ment's adherence to its own objectives. The process of gathering evidence is a familiar function of a police department. No detailing of investigative tecIu1iques is required in this report. However, when the investigation is for internal disciplinary purposes several important modifications, primarily of a legal nature, must take place. In general, there are fewer legaJ restrictions on an internal administrative investigation than on a criminal investigation. But the restrictions which do exist are rigid, and it is important that they be recognized and followed. The failure to do so may result in improperly gathered evidence being overturned upon appeal by the officer, just as a criminal conviction may be reversed for procedural error. The Jegal restrictions on internal investigations stem primarily from judicial interpretations of constitutional provisions, but may also be found in The Disciplille Process 6S statutes such as the \"Police Officer's Bill of Rights,\" or in collective bargaining agreements. They may also come from local ordinances or administrative regu\u00ad lations, such as civil service or personnel department rules. For pUrposes of the following discussion, only broadly applicable constitutional or common statu\u00ad tory provisions will be discussed. Criminal Prosecution. At an early stage of any internal investigation, it is necessary to decide whether the evidence and the allegation warrant criminal prosecution of the police officer. If it appears that a criminal charge may be brought, the investigation must adhere to all of the restrictions of a normal criminal investigation. Search and seizure restrictions apply, and Miranda warnings must be given. (In two departments studied, investigators are required, either b~\" contract or by the Police Officer's Bill of Rights, to give Miranda\u00ad type warnings to accused officers, even where it is certain that no criminal charges will be brought). An officer may face both criminal and internal charges, but evidence gathered for internal discipline which violates ctiminal investigative standards may not be used in the criminal prosecution. Therefore, careful con\u00ad sideration must be given to the method by which the department will proceed agains t the officer. Far1ure to Cooperate. At the outset, it should be noted that whenever an officer may be legally ordered to take (or not to take) some action (e.g., answer questions or stand in a lineup) regarding an internal investigation, and fails to obey that order, such failure may be the basis for a further charge against the officer. The officer must be informed, however, that his or her failure to coop\u00ad erate may lead to further diSCiplinary action, including discharge. Seattle Police Officers' Guild v. Seattle, 494 P.2d 485 (Wash. 1972). Whether the officer may be lawfully ordered to take some action is discussed below. Questioning the Officer. One of the most efficient methods of investi\u00ad gating a complaint against an officer is to question the officer. The questions asked officers must be \"narrowly and directly\" related to the performance of their duties and the ongoing investigation. Gardner v. Broderick, 393 U.S. 273 (1968). In other words, officers may not be forced to answer questions having little to do with their performance as police officers or unrelated to the matter under investigation. Police officers do not have the right to refuse to answer questions that are directly and narrowly related to their official duties. An officer who refuses to answer such questions may be ordered to do so. However, when an officer is being questioned about conduct that is or could be criminal, he or she should be advised of his or her Miranda tights prior to the interview. Any inCriminating statements by an officer, obtained under direct order, will not be admissible in a ________________ \u00b7\u00b7 _______ , _____________ \u00b7 .. oI!!oI!!~~f--------------- ________ ~ 66 DISCIPLINE PROCEDURES AND PROCESSES criminal prosecution unless the officer has been advised of his or her Miranda rights and has waived them. Garrity v. New Jersey, 385 U.S. 493 (1967). Incriminating statements obtained under direct order will, however, be admis\u00ad sible in an administrative hearing arising out of the alleged misconduct. Officers may not be forced to waive their privilege against self-incrimination under threat of losing their jobs. Such coercion makes the waiver involuntary. Garrity supra; Varela v. Commissioners, 283 P.2d 62 (Cal. Ct. App. 1951). A slightly different, but related issue arises concerning the questioning of officers by grand juries. Officers being questioned regarding criminal activity by a grand jury may not be forced to waive their rights against self-incrimination, either by the grand jury or by the department. Confederation of Police v. COl1lisk, 489 F.2d 891 (7th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 416 U.S. 956 (1974). The department may, for internal purposes, ask the officer about the same criminal activity, but it may not discipline the officer simply for failure to answer grand jury questions. Right to Counsel. There is no constitutional right to counsel during an internal administrative investigation. Jones v. Civil Service Comm '11., 489 P.2d 320 (Colo. 1971). Therefore, in the absence of a statute, contract provision or personnel rule providing otherwise, an officer has no right to have counsel present while being interrogated, unless criminal prosecution is contemplated. Boulware \u00bb. Battaglia, 344 F.Supp. 889 (D. Del. 1972), aff'd, 478 F.2d 1398 (1973). However, if it appears that the presence of counsel will not disrupt the investigation, there is no good reason to prevent counsel's presence. The depart\u00ad ment should make it clear that it is not adopting a general policy of allowing counsel to be present, for then violation of that policy in a specific case might be deemed \"arbitrary\" and inherently unfair. If the department does adopt a general practice of allowing attorneys to be present, it should be careful not to violate that practice without clearly stated reasons. In several departments researched, officials expressed a policy of allowing an accused officer to have an attorney present during questioning, although some would not allow the attorney to participate. Others stated that tlley have never been confronted with this Situation, but would probably allow an attorney to be present upon request. Polygraph. The law in most jurisdictions is clear that a police officer may be compelled to submit to a polygraph exam for internal purposes. Roux v. New Orleans, 223 So.2d 905 (La. App. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1008 (1970). Polygraph results usually are not admissible in a criminal court. Frazee v. Civil Service Board, 338 P.2d 943 (Cal. App. 1959). The polygraph results may be admissible in an internal administrative hearing. Chambliss v. Board of Fire & The Disdpbile Process 67 Police Commissiollers, 312 N.E.2d 842 (Ill. Ct. App. 1974). This is not true, however, in all jurisdictions. Most all of the agencies visited during this study made USe of the poly\u00ad graph in intemaJ investigations. It was found that thE-se agencies had qualified operators on their staffs to administer the tests. Commonly, officers were disci\u00ad plined for insubordination if they refused to take the polygraph. Physical Tests. The law regarding the taking and use of non testimonial evidence is the same for administrative purposes as for criminal prosecutions. Police officers may be compelled to submit to breatlt or blood tests, voiceprin t exams, handWriting samples, hair samples, etc., and such evidence may be used against them. Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757 (1966); N.Y.S.2d aff'g, 302 N.Y.S.2d 109 (1969). Search and Selzul'e. Police officers have the right, under the Fourth Amendment, to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. Fourth Amend\u00ad ment warrant requirements apply to any search of an officer's personal property including clothing, car, home or other belongings. McPherson v. New York City Hsg. Authority, 365 N.Y.S.2d 862 (1975). Evidence obtained from illegal searches cannot be used as evidence, even in administrative disciplinary pro\u00ad ceed.tngs. Smyth v. Lubbers, 398 F.Supp. 777 0V. D. Mich. 1975);McPherson, supra. Departmental property used by the officer, such as lockers, vehicles, desks, etc., may be searched without a warrant. People v. Tidwell, 266 N.E.2d 787 (Ill. 1971). It is best that there be an announced department policy that such property is subject to search at any time, in order to vitiate any expectations of privacy. ;:,ee U.S. v. Katz, 389 U.S. 347 (1968). Wiretaps and Eavesdropping. The use of wiretaps, body transmitters, moni\u00ad toring of conversations, etc., in an internal investigation is subject to the Same restrictions which are applicable to citizens in general. 18 U.s.C.A. \u00a72511 ; Allen v. Murphy, 322 N.Y.S.2d 435 (197 1); Bou[ware v. Battaglia, supra. However, the monitoring of phones used exclusively for departmental business by one having authority to supervise and control the use of the phones may be permissible. People v. Canard, 65 CaL Rptr. 15 (Ct. App. 1967), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 912 (1969). Lineups. A police officer may be ordered to stand in a lineup to be viewed by witnesses or complainants of police misconduct. There is no need for probable cause and the officer may be disciplined for refusal. Biehunik Jl. Felicetta, 441 F.2d 228 (2d Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 403 U.S. 932 (1971). Of course, the lineup must be fairly constructed so as not to be unfairly suggestive. The same rule applies to photo arrays. ,'1 68 DISCIPLINE PROCEDURES AND PROCESSES Entrapment. The defense of entrapment seems to have no application to administrative hearings. While the law on this ~',ubject is changing, and there is some dispute as to what constitutes entrapment (see United States v. Russell, 411 U.S. 423 (1973\u00bb), there have been no cases which have held that an officer may raise the defense at a discipline proceeding. One case holds that he may not. JOlles v. Civil Service Comm 'n, supra. Other Investigative Tools.

Constitutional concepts such as due process and nght to pnvacy hmlt investigative methods to the same extent as in criminal cases. On the other hand, it must be remembered that even those methods which are constitutionally permissible may be restricted or prohibited by local statute, rule, or contract. Charging The formal filing of charges against an officer in an administrative disci\u00ad plinary case serves the same purpose as the issuance of an indictment or fin infor\u00ad mation in a criminal case. It serves to officially notify the officer that he or she is being charged with a violation of departmental rules, states the underlying basis of the charge, and informs the officer of steps tv take to answer the charge. This step i~ ::Jften overlooked or inadequately handled by polir.e departments, which oft!!'I' leads to later difficulty in upholding disciplinary action. Effect of Criminal Ozarges. Often police misconduct may be of such a nature as to constitute a violation of the criminal law as well as of departmental rules. Where criminal charges are brought against the officer, there is a question as to what effect this has or should have on the filing of internal discipline pro\u00ad ceedings. Likewise, when the criminal case has been resolved either by convic\u00ad tion or acquittal, there is a question as to the effect on discipline. As to the latter issue, the law in most jurisdictions is that the criminal and administrative procedures are two entirely separate and unrelated events with no effect on one another. Thus, an acquittal of a criminal charge does not prevent the department from diSciplining an officer for the same conduct. Board of Education v. Calderon, 110 Cal. Rptr. 916 (1974), appeal dismissed, 419 U.S. 807 (1975); Howle v. Persollnel Board of Appeals, 176.S.E.2d 663 v. Paull, 177 A. 352 CR.!. 1935). Cases which have held that an employee may not be di~ciplined where there has been an acquittal on criminal charges seem to have l!1volved situations where the officer was charged by the department with \"violation of II Ij The Discipline Process 69 the criminal law\" per se, rather than with the underlying act. Thus, where the officer is acquitted of the crime, it is impossible to prove that he or she \"violated the law\" for in ternal purposes. Had the department charged the actual conduct rather than \"a criminal act\" (e.g., \"larceny\" rather than \"violation of the penal code\") it could have proceeded to prove the larceny by its own evidence, rather than having to dismiss the case because of a criminal acquittal. See Reeb v.Civil Service Commission, 503 P.2d 629 (Colo. Ct. App. 1972). It is often easier to prove a case in a diSciplinary hearing than in a criminal court. Therefore, a criminal a<;:quittal should not bar any administrative action. . The other issue regarding simultaneous criminal and administrative charges IS delay ('If the administrative hearing pending the outcome of the criminal trial. This is not strictly a legal issue, but often the possibility of a criminal acquittal is cited as requiring the delay of the disciplinary action. As just pointed out, this is not a legal concern. More important is the tactical concern. The facts pre\u00ad sented by the department in a disciplinary action are normally a matter of public record. Therefore, a defense attorney in a criminal action against the officer would hav\\! easy access to a great deal of the prosecution's evidence, which may be a disadvantage to the state. On the other hand, the harm done by delaying the administrati \"';) hearing may oatweigh the benefits. Criminal trials and appeals frequently drag out for months and years. For the department to delay bringing charges often means that the administrative case must be presented on stale evidence, witnesses have disappeared, old wounds are reopened, the community becomes agitated anew, and the officer and family are kept in limbo that J'rluch longer. If the department ultimately loses the diSciplinary action, there may'be a large amount of money to be paid in back wages. Finally, diSciplinary action delayed for too long loses its deterrent effect on the remainder of the department. In fact, it may have the opposite effect. Police officers often complain about the delays in the criminal trial process. They should be careful to avoid building the same delays into departmental prvcedures. Drafting Charges. The notice to the officer need not be in any particular form. A simple letter from the chief or other charging party is suffiCient. How\u00ad ever, the content of the notice must be sufficient to :nform the officer ade\u00ad quately as to precisely what it is he or she is accused of dOing, and the specific violation of departmental rules which is charged. The officer is also entitled to receive the notice sufficiently early to have a reasonable time to prepare an answer or defense to the charges. Niazy )J. Utica Civil Sel1Jice Comm 'n, 206 N.W.2d 468 (Mich. Ct. App. 1973). If the officer fails to object to the lack of specificity or timeliness of the charges, there may be a waiver of any defect in 70 DISCIPLINE PROCEDURES AND PROCESSES them. Baker v. Woodbury, 492 S.W.2d 157 (Mo. Ct. App. 1973). However, some courts may hold that such defects are fatal, and failure to object at an early stage does not constitute waiver. Niazy, supra. In order to avoid problems of vagueness, it is advisable to draft charges in terms similar to a warrant or indictment. Thus, In addition to conclusory lan\u00ad guage (' ... did violate Art. 4 \u00a7 13 of Department Rules, prohibiting acceptance of gratuities .. .\"), the charge should include a brief statement of the facts underlying the charge (\" ... in that the officer did, on October 4,1975 at ... \"). A related asper:t of the \"vagueness\" problem is that of inherently vague departmental rules, such as those on \"conduct unbecoming an officer.\" Some courts have held that such rules are so broad that it is impossible for an officer to know what conduct is prohibited and what is not. Therefore, the courts have held, it is unfair to charge some specific act which the officer had no way of knowing in advance would be held \"conduct unbecoming.\" See Sponick. v. Detroit police Dept., Ct. App. 1973); Bence JI. Breier, SllP!:t. This is not a problem of drafting charges, but of formulating the rules of ,he department. If the rule itself is inherently vague, no amount of after-the\u00ad fact inclusion of facts will suffice to validate a charge under the rule. Resolution The law of most states and federal due process standards require that an officer be allowed a hearing on disciplinary charges. It is not mandatory that the hearing be before departmeiital personnel, or even that the police department offer a hearing at all. It is enough that. at some point before any disciplinary action becomes permanent and final, the officer be given the right to a due process hearing. Deering JI. Seattle, 520 P.2d 638 (Wash. 1974), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1050 (1975); Amett JI. Kennedy, supra. Thus, officers may be suspended, demoted or discharged before an adn1inistrative due process hearing so long as they are given an opportunity to have a due process hearing within a reas~na~le time. However, if the officer serves at the will and pleasure of the apP01l1ting authority, no hearing is required. Bishop v. Wood, 426 U.S. 341 (1976). The hearing requirement does not apply to probationary employees. Pro\u00ad visions for a period of probation for new employees usually specify that a probationer may be discharged from the department at any time, for any reason. Therefore. an employee on probation has noexpe'~tation of job security, and no \"property interest\" in the job. Since discharge does not, therefore, infringe on any property right, there is no need for a due process hearing. There are, how\u00ad ever, three exceptions. A probationer is entitled to a hearing if: The Discipline Process 71 1. The discipline is for the exercise of a constitutional right such as free speech. Perry v. Sindermanll, supra. 2. The discipline is for any reason which would put in doubt the officer's good name, reputation, honor O[ integrity; for example cheating on an exam or taking bribes. Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.'s. 564 (1972); 3. The discipline action would bar the officer's reemployment by other g~ve~nment employers; for example, state law may provide that the dIsmIssal from one police department would automatically prevent employment by any other department in the state. Board of Regents JI. Rotil, supra. The hearing need not be conducted like a criminal trial, but basic due process must be afforded. At a minimum tlus means the right to call conf 0 t and .. ' r n , . cross-examltle \\~ltnesses. In e:ception number one, the findings must be supported .by the weIght of the eVIdence; however, in exceptions two and three the probatIOl<jer'S right is only to record the facts. Composition of Hearing Board. The persons before whom the hearing is held must be neu~ral, impartial and detached from prior proceedings in the I11fttter. ~e:~nd tl1lS ge~~ra! rule, there !s no particular constitutional require\u00ad ment rega, dJl1g compOSItIOn of the hearIng board. In fact, it is not mandatory that there be a \"board\" at aU; a single hearing officer is sufficient. In some areas state .law, local ordinance, or departmental rule mandate that certain person~ constItute the hearing ~ane1. S? ~ong as all such persons meet the \"impartiality\" ~est, any arra~lg~ment ,IS penmsslble. There is no requirement that officers be Jud~ed by their peen ; they are not constitutionally entitled to have officers of ~hel: own. ran~ on ~he paneL Factors such as blood relationship to one of the ,JartJes, pnor dIrect lJ1volvement in the case, a direct benefit in the outcome 0 any .o~he~ such conflict of interest will be enough to support a motion for diS~ quahfIcatlon of a hearing officer. Mank v. Gral1ite City 288 N E 2d 49 App. 1972). ' . . .. . . ~ majority of the departmerlts studied by the IACP used internal dlsclphnary boards to advise the chief in disciplinary cases. Approximately 50 percent of these boards included' a member of the accused officer's rank According to questionnaire results, 85 percent of the officers survey~d though; ~hat an ac~used officer should have the right to be judged by a group whicl) 1l1cluded hIS ~ellow.offic~rs. While such representation is not mandated by law, i~ ~ppears that lJ1cJuslOn ot an officer of the accused's rank on disciplinary boards ll1creases officer confidence in the disciplinary hearing process. ': , , , 72 DISCIPLINE PROCEDURES AND PROCESSES It was found in most agencies, however, that officers did not make full use of this hearing to question administrative actions. Many officers, as expressed during interviews, do not feel that internal hearing boards afford .am~le op?or\u00ad tunity for full and objective review of the facts. It was stated dunng 1l1tervle~s that the lack of a concrete policy on the board's use and the lack of commIt\u00ad ment by certain superior officers to an impartial hearing limit the usefulness of the board. Right to Coullsel. An officer does not have a constitutional. right to counsel in an administrative disciplinary hearing. Boulware v. Battaglza, supra. There may be statutory or contract provisions for such a right, but it does not exist as a Sixth Amendment right. However, there are several reasons why the department might want to allow counsel to be present and participate full~ in an internal hearing. First, counsel will often stipulate to facts and concluslO~s without full proof (to save time, expense and unnecessary presen~e o~ WIt\u00ad nesses); second, the likelihood of the defense presenting irrel~vant, .Jrf~t~onal, incompetent or scandalous evidence or testimony is substantIally dlm1l1lshed; third, issues and arguments presented after the conclusion of testimo~y are mO.re narrow, direct and to the point; and fourth, it will avoid any later claJl11 of de111al of Sixth Amendment righ ts, and adverse resolu tion of such a claim, tlntS preserv- ing greater control in the hands of the department. . Sllbpoellas. State or local law may give the department subpoena po~er 1:1 internal discipline cases. Where such administrative subpoena power e~lsts It normally requires judicial enforcement. That is, the department may Issue a subpoena., but if the subpoena is not obeyed, the department must go to ~ourt to obtain a court order compelling obedience to the subpoena. NoncomplIance with the court order may be punishable as contempt. . Administrative subpoenas are useful, especially in obtaining productlOn of documents such as medical records, bank record;;, telephone and other utility records, etc. However, the authority to issue such subpoenas must be estab- lished by law, not simply by departmen tal rule. ..' Open Hearings. An officer does not have a constItutIOnal fight to an \"open\" or public hearing. Kelly v. Stern, 299 A.2~ 390 (~.J', 1973;,', cert. denied, 414 U.S. 822 (1974); Klein v. Board of police & Fire Comm 15,318 N .E.2d 726 (Ill. ct. Apr. 1974). On the other hand, the department may hold an open hearing even though the officer objects. F.C.C. v. Schreiber, 381 U.S. 279 (1965). . There are various reasons both for and against open heanngs. In favor of closed hearings are the facts that public disclosure mi~ht giv.e the hear~ngs a punitive, rather than corrective atmosphere', open heann~s might result IJ1 the The Discipline Process 73 curtailment of liberal discovery proceedings due to sensitive information bein presented; and public confidence in the agency might be undermined by ex~ posure of every departure from departmental rules. O.n. the ~ther hand, there is in the law a general policy favoring disclosure ?f ad~1111stratlve poceedings. Openness may promote public confidence in the l.ntegr~ty of .the depa:.~ment and the fairness of the proceedings, and act as a restramt agamst the fllh1~ of frivolous or insubstantial charges against an officer. In order to overcome this legal preference for openness, the department must show a good r.eason for closing any hearing, especially where the officer has requested that It be open. Fitzgerald v. Hampton 467 F.2d 755 (U SAD C 1972). ,.. pp. . . TI'~lIscripts and Findings. A court reviewing a disciplinary action upon appeal Will lo.ok only at the written record of the proceedings. No new evidence may b~ cOllSlClered by the court, and the court will not presume any facts 110t stated 111. the record. Ther~fore, it is. essential. that a record of the proceedings be made (preferably ~ verbatIm tra.nscnpt), and It is essential that the hearing board clearly state the eVIdence on which its decision is based. A written opinion of the board, like a judicial opinion, should state the facts which the board beiieves to have beel.1 proved by the evidence, include reference to any pertinent documents upon which the board relies, and contain a clear statement of the reasons behind the bo.ard:s final action. In general, an officer is eniitled to a copy of the tra~lscnpt 111 order to prepare an appea1. Bowles v. Baer 142 F.2d 1r. heanng IS the nght to call and cross-examine witnesses (this is another area where administrative subpoena power is critical). If the officer or the ~oard cannot compel the presence and testimony of essential witnesses, the hearIng may not comply with requirements of due process. All available l11~asures, including judicial subpoena, should be utilized to obtain necessary wltn~sses. See, generally, Riclzardson v. Perales, 402 A.2d 99 (Pa. 1959). . Rlll~s of Evidence. In general, strict adherence to rules of evidence is not requ~r~d Ill. an administrative hearing. Richardson JI, Perales, supra. Some state admu1!stratIve pror:e.dures acts are applicable to law enforcement agencies; how\u00ad ever, even tl:ose whIch do apply to such agencies do not usually require adher\u00ad ence to stnct rules of evidence at internal discipline hearings. Therefore a dep~rtl11ent hearing board is free to consider hearsay evidence and/or \"expe~t\" testimony, and need not requir~ the laying of a foundation for receipt of evi\u00ad dence. American Rubber Products v, NLRB, 214 F.2d 47 (7th Cir. 1954). It is ','f --- -~~--~ ~--- ~ ~.---r 74 DISCIPLINE PROCEDURES AND PROCESSES generally provided that irrelevant, immaterial, and repetitive evidence shall be excluded, but the test for determining such conditions is loosely applied. Any evidence which is admitted shall be given its \"natural probative effect.\" Diaz v. United States, 223 U.S. 442 (1912). That is, if the evidence is admitted, it is to be considered along with all other evidence, for whatever it is worth, in determining the facts. Some kinds of evidence must be excluded. For example, the attorney\u00ad client or marital privileges still apply, and illegaltv seized evidence is not admis\u00ad sible. This latter rule is a corollary of the fact, discussed above, that an officer does not lose the right against illegal search and seizure. Smyth JJ. Lubbers, wpra; McPherson v. New York City Hsg. Authority, supra. Any officer's personnel record may be admissible for some purposes. If the officer is charged with incompetence, dereliction of du ty, ineffiCiency or some such offense involving a pattern of behavior over a period of time, the record may be admitted to show the pattern. Hughes v. Department of Public Safety, 273 N.W. 618 (Minn. 1937). Most courts hold, however, that an officer's record is only admissible for purposes of determining the punishment to be im\u00ad posed, not for G::!termining guilt or innocence on the particular charge. Mil/bum Twp. v. Civil Service Comm'n, 16 A.2d 824 (NJ.l940). Few, if any, of the departments studied adhered strictly to the rules of evidence at administrative hearings. In fact, many of the hearing officials inter\u00ad viewed were actively hostile regarding rules of evidence, viewing these as legal technicalities used by defense lawyers to keep the board from determining the facts of the case. Standard of Proof' Burdell of Proof. The \"presumption of innocence,\" applicable in a criminal prosecution, is not applicable in an administrative hearing. Nevertheless, in bringing the charges, the department has the burden of presenting its case prior to the defense stating its case. Heidebur v. Parker, 505 S.W.2d 440 (Mo. 1974). The burden is on the department to prove guilt, and the officer need respond only after a qrima facie case has been established. In order to be upheld on appeal, any disciplinary action imposed must be supported by at least \"substantial evidence.\" The usual standard in criminal cases is that guilt must be proved \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" In administra\u00ad tive hearings, however, the standard is lower. \"Substantial evidence\" or a \"pre\u00ad ponderance of the evidence\" is the usual standard of proofin civil cases. This is the minimal standard for internal discipline cases. Kammerer v. Board of Fire & Police Comm'l's, 256 N.E.2d 12 (I11. 1970); Q11Z S.W.2d (Tex. eiv. App. 1969); Kelly v. Murphy, 282 N.Y.S.2d 254 (1967).

The police officer, in the daily performance of duties, encounters many stress-producing sihwtions. The officer may also experience marital problems, financial difficul\u00ad ties, or other extra duty problems which aff(;ct his or her performance. Traditionally, law enforcement has used internal disciplinary measures to correct these undesirable situations. However, it has been found that this approach does not eliminate the problem or provide any information to management regarding future causes of misconduct.16 Alternative means should be employed to rectify these problems and perhaps aid an officer who ha& much to contribute. Two approaches which attempt to create more positive means for cor\u00ad rectino stress-related problems are the \"peer review panel concept,\" used by the K\"'ansas City Police Departmentl7 and other agencies, and the \"psycho\u00ad logical services concept\" used by the Dallas Police Department and other organizations. 1 8 Peer review concept. This is a technique uoed to identify potential sources of misconduct arising from family problems, the identification of psychological disord'~rs and/or personality characteristics which may affect job performance. Officers are referred to a panel of peers for consultation at their own initiative, at the request of other 'officers, or after receiving three or more external or internal complaints in one year. The panel u~es peer pressure to foster self\u00ad awareness of difficulties and point out that similar problems are faced success\u00ad fully by other officers. The strength of this approach is its emphasis on pusitive treatment of problems without exposure to the negative ramifications of control and punislmlent. . Psychological services cOl1cept. This is a proactive approach to preventll1g putcntial difficulties which relies on the identification of officers and resorts to counseling sessions to correct problems. Officers may be referred to this unit, consisting of qualified psychologists, by fellow members of the agency, superiors, or internal affairs personnel. The principal objective of the unit is to \"better utilize and maintain manpower resoufCI.!s .... by providing an alterna- . I 't' t' ,,1 9 tive or adjunct to stnct y pum lVe, corree lve measures. The success of these approaches is largely dependent on officer reactions to the use of counseling services. Police administrators should stress the advan- 16 James S. Hillgren and L. W. Spradlin, \"A Positive Disciplinary System for the Dallas Police,\" Police Clzief, XLII, No.7, July 1975, p. 65. 17Kansas City, Missouri Police Department, \"Peer Review Panel Office,\" Kansas City, Mo., 1973 (Mimeographed). 18 Hillgren and Spradlin, p. 66. 19Hillgren and Spradlin, p. 67. The Discipline Process 77 tages that may result from their use. One department visited by the IACP was in the process of developing a psychological services unit. The importance of officer acceptance (as opposed to skepticism and ridicule) was pointed out by the department psychologist. He stated that officers with difficulties will be able to recognize their own problems and their need for the counseling service, when there is a full commitment to the counseling unit by all agency personnel. Legal Restrictions on the Imposition of Sanctions. The major consider2\u00b7 tion in imposing sanctions is that the \"punishment\" must fit the offense. If the sanction is excessive, unfair, or arbitrary in comparison to the harm done by the offense, a court may reduce the penalty. Pell v. Board of Education, 313 N.E.2d 321 (N.Y. 1974). Often a court will review the penalty in terms of whether it is so excessive as to \"shock the conscience\"; if not, the penalty will stand. Few courts are willing to overturn an administrative decision regarding the imposition of a sanction. However, as more and more police discipline cases are subjected to binding arbitration under employee contracts, a greater number of penalties are being reduced by \"impartial\" arbitrators. A common tactic of an arbitrator, who is paid by both parties to the action, is to find that the employee has engaged in misconduct, but to lJduce the penalty for the offense.2 \u00b0 Nevertheless, it is true that penalties may not be inconsistent or arbitrary. It often happens that because the composition of trial boards varies from case to case, widely disparate penalties are imposed for substantially similar conduct by officers with similar recOlds. In such cases, it will be difficult for the department to justify the more severe sanction. Clear reasons must be stated to support a finding of \"guilt\" in a discipli\u00ad nary hearing; there also must be a clear statement of reasons for imposition of a particular sanction. The usual factors involved in the determination of a punish\u00ad ment will be the nature of the offense and the officer's prior record. These are legitimate factors to consider, but the particular Significance accorded each factor must be stated. The more severe the punishment, the more it must be sup\u00ad ported by the record. In order to avoid problems of inconsistency in punishment, some depart\u00ad ments have established a \"schedule\" of sanctions appropriate for variolls offenses. Just as each criminal offense carries a prescribed penalty, each offense has been assigned a certain type of penalty. Some departments assign a certain range of maximum and minimum penalties for each offense, in order to allow for other factors, such as previous record, to enter into the c1cision-making 20 International Association of Chiefs of Police, Public Safety Labor Reporter, Discipline: 2-74 (1973). .,-,.r 78 DISCIPLINE PROCEDURES AND PROCESSES process. Such a procedure of predetermined sanctions eliminates a great deal of potential abuse or inconsistency in settine penalties for misconduct. On the other hand, it may diminish the flexibility and discretion to consider such factors as extenuating circumstances and the officer's prior record. Appeals An officer has a legal right to appf,al to a court any administrative disci\u00ad plinary action. Even if there is no statutory provisiol1 for appeal (which exists in virtually all jlHisdictions), such action could be appealed on grounds of a denial of due process oflaw. Prior to appeal to a court, however, the officer must have exhausted his or her administrative remedies. That is, the officer must have taken advantage of available procedures to have the disciplinary action overruled or modified by the police chief or other executive officer, such as a civil service commission. There are a wide variety of administrative remedies established among the various states and localities. In some jurisdictions the department is the sole authority in discipline matters. In others, an agency outside the department has total control. Administrative review may range from a complete rehearing of the case, to merely examining the record to assure that a fair hearing was held and enough evidence was admitted to support the finding. Judicial review, also, may include a triai de novo of the entire case, or simply a review of the evidence presented and procedures utilized. In most cases, howe'!er, judicial review of administrative action is limited to a determination of whether enough legal evidence was produced to support the findings and action. The court will confine its review in such cases to an examination of the record of the administrative action. Another method of appealing disciplinary action against an officer is through the process of arbitration. Some state statutes and union contracts contain clauses requiring binding arbitration of grievances. When disciplinary action against an officer becomes the subject of a grievance, it is open to modifi\u00ad cation by an outside independent civilian arbitrator or arbitration panel. Again, the arbitrator will look primarily at whether the evidence supports the adminis\u00ad trative action, including the penalty imposed. The arbitrator may uphold, modify or rescind any part of the disciplinary action. As stated above, a common strategy of arbitrators is to uphold the findings of misconduct by the officer, but to reduce to a minor level the penalty imposed on the grounds that the punishment set by the department was \"too harsh.\" Thi!> is espeCially true when the employee has a relatively \"clean\" record, regardless of the severity of iff i \u00b7R The Discipline Process 79 the misconduct. For this reason, it is essential that police administrators assure that the record contains ample discussion of the reasons for impOSition of a particular pena!ty. Officer attitudes regarding external appeals were researched in this project. It Was found that most officers were uncertain about the fairness of external procedures. More negative perceptions were obtained in those agencies in which appeals were most numerous, indicating that greater familiarity, in this case, breeds dissatisfaction. This finding does not in itself indicate that external procedures are unfair, but does provide e\",idence that officers have little confi. dence in the actions of government officials in many jurisdictions.2 1 Discovery of Personnel and Internal Affairs Files Although the subject of discovery of personnel records and internal affairs files in criminal and nondiscipline civil cases may seem to be somewhat periph\u00ad eral to the discipline system, this type of discovery has a serious impact upon the effective functioning of the system. Police agencies may become reluctant to record complaints, investigations and dispositions if these materials will be made available to civil plaintiffs and criminal defendants. Witnesses may be loathe to testify, and investigators may be hesitant to write detailed reports. It is essential to the proper functioning of the discipline process that internal affairs files be confidential and not available to litigants in criminal court caSes and nondisci\u00ad pline civil cases. Criminal Cases. Defendants in criminal cases increasingly are seeking dis\u00ad covery of personnel and internal affairs files of all officers who will be called upon to testify in the criminal trial. The rationale for requesting discovery is to find negative information in the files which may be used during cross-examina\u00ad tion of the officers. Many courts have disallowed such discovery on the grounds of governmental privilege and irrelevancy of the records to the criminal case. Other courts have granted discovery on the basis that the criminal defendant needed the information to prepare his or her defense. It has been successfully argued that police personnel records are confiden\u00ad tial. Routine exposure of such files to public inspection would undermine the police department's ability to fully and accurately record officer performances. This line of thinking stems from the United States Supreme Court ruling in United States v. Reynolds, 345 U.S. 1 (1951), that a court may not auto- 21 Further information un officer perceptions of outside appeal procedures is included in Appendix A, pp. 248-250 and p. 252. ~, : '\\ 1 80 DISCIPLINE PROCEDURES AND PROCESSES matically grant an examination of confidential governmental files without a prior showing, by the one demanding the records, that they were necessary to the litigation before the court. A common procedural device used by defense counsel to compel discovery of personnel and internal affairs files is a subpoena duces tecum. In order to prevent such discovery, the prosecutor may file a motion to quash the subpoena. To support the subpoena, the defense will attempt to demonstrate that the production of the documents is relevant and material to the controversy at hand and will facilitate the ascertainment of facts and a fair trial. Frequently the prosecution or the police department, through its own attorney, will allege that a governmental pnvilege bars discovery of official information whose disclosure is implicitly against the public interest. Of course, the final determination in granting inspection lies within the sole discretion of the court. When deciding whether to permit discovery of police personnel files, the court must first consider whether the party seeking the information has at least plausible justification for inspection. Joe Z. v. Superior Court, 91 Cal. Rptr. 594 (1970). A recer:t California decision seems to suggest that the determination should be based upon a rule of relevancy; that is, the judge should decide whether the evidence sought would tend logically, and by reasonable inferences, to establish any material fact in support of the requesting party's position, or to disprove the opposing party's pOSition. An accused in a criminal prosecution may compel discovery by demonstrating that the requested information will facilitate the ascertainment of the facts and a fair trial. Thl! requisite showing may be satisfied by general allegations which establish some cause for discovery other than a \"mere desire for the benefit of all informa\u00ad tion which has been obtained by the People in their investigation of the crime.\" Pitchess v. Supel1\u00b7or Court, 522 P.2d 305 (Cal. 1974). However, it has also been held that the right of an accused to obtain dis\u00ad covery is not absolute even upon a showing of good cause: In criminal cases, the Court retains wide discretion to protect against the disclosure of information which might unduly hamper the prose\u00ad cution or violate some other legitimate governmental inter\u00a33t. Joe Z. v. Superior Court, supra. --f I t 1 : I 'I I ;1 i\u00b7.l ,I il ;1 Tile Disclj)/ille Process 81 In many states, the courts recognize a qualified privilege against disclosure. In such circumstances, a subpoena duces tecum will not have to be honored unless the person issuing the subpoena can show that: 1. The documents sought are evidentiary and relevant 2. The information cannot be obtained in advance of trial through rea\u00ad sonably diligent efforts 3. The pbrson cannot otherwise properly prepare for trial, and delay might be caused 4. The person is acting in good faith. United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683 (1975). Thus, discover) of police personnel files was refused in two 1973 New York cases. In People ).', Norman, 350 N. Y.S.2d 52 (1973), the judge opined: (TJ he courts in this state have recognized a privilege against dis\u00ad covery where a public interest will be served .... This Court is of the opinion that it is in the public interest to main tain confidentiali\u00ad ty of personnel folders of police officers. The Court recognizes the fact that the Police Department conducts thorough investigations of police candidates before they are appointed because of the sensitive nature of their employment, the pOSition of public trust which they will hold and the formidable power entrusted to them by virtue of their statutory functions .... It is not a condition of a police officer's er,1ployment that his life story should be the subject of perusal by judges, prosecutor and defense counsel each time he makes an arrest. To impose such a burden on the officer would be tantamount to an unconstitutional deprivation of his right to privacy. In another Ne\\v York case, the requisite good faith was found lacking in aUtigant who was seeking inspection on the mere possibility that the records would reval some \"b\"d act\" that would be useful in impeaclunent. People v. Fraiser, 348 N.Y.S.2d 529 (1973). \" if 1, \\r ; .. . 0 \u00b75 82 DISCIPLINE PROCEDURES AND PROCESSES The District of Columbia Court of Appeals relied upon the Nixon case, supra, in quashing a subpoena duces tecum issued by a criminal defendant charged with the negligent homicide of a police officer. Cooper v. United States, 353 A.2d 696 (D.C. 1975). In California, an assertion of privilege was sustained at an in c([mera hear\u00ad ing where neither defense nor prosecution were represented. The Court reasoned that the file of the policeman contained nothing not already known to counsel or which could possibly have aided in the defense. Thus, the defendant's request, based on the contention that the police officer had a propensity for violence, was properly denied. People v. Woolmall, 115 Cal. Rptr. 324 (Ct. App. 1974). This is in accordance with the general view that requests for discovery may be denied when the inspection constitutes nothing more than a \"fishing expedi\u00ad tion.\" People v. Fraiser, supra; Cooper v. United States, supra; Ballard v. Superior Court, 49 Cal. Rptr. 302 (1966). It must be emphasized that the privilege against release of information is not absolute, just as the right of a party seeking discovery is not without bounds. When ruling upon the question of discovery of police files, courts will balance the justification for confidentiality with the need for disclosure, and attempt to reach a result which best serves the interests of justice. Under s;,ch an analysis, it has been held that the prosecution cannot commence criminal proceedings and then invoke its governmental privileges to deprive the accused of anything that might be material to the accused's defense. Pitchess v. Superior Court, supra. In another case, an Arizona court ordered an in camera inspection of internal affairs records of officers who would be testifying against the defendant, stating, \"If any records are found to have materiality or possible usefulness to the defendant, they will be turned over to the defendant. ... \" State v. Franze, No. A-21630, Superior Court of Pima Co., Ariz. (1973). In Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), the Supreme Court stated that \"the suppression by the prosecution of e\\'idence favorable to the accused upon request violated due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punisl'tment irrespec\u00ad tive of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\" A recent District of Columbia decision holds that police personnel files might constitute \"evidence favorable to the accused,\" and hence be subject to discovery under the Brady rule. United States v, Akers (D.C. Super. Ct., November 24, 1975). When a court orders a police department to produce personnel or internal affairs records, the particular records listed on the order must be produced. Failing to respond to such an order amounts to contempt of court. An alterna\u00ad tive to complying with the order wo.llrl.be to have the prosecutor dismiss the case. Pitclzess, supra. This choice is tile same as the one available to the govern-1 I ,I \\1 I \\1 The Discipline Process 83 ment when faced with an order to disclose the identity of a confidential informant. Civil Cases. Generally, the discovery of records is more wide ranging in civil cases than in criminal cases. However, more extensive discovery is becoming the rule in criminal cases. This pattern has been illustrated in the analysis of dis\u00ad covery of personnel and internal affairs records of officer-witnesses in criminal cases. Civil litigants seek personnel and internal affairs records of officer\u00ad witnesses as well as of officer-defendants in order to impeach the witnesses and defendants and to prove a propensity for violence or ether misconduct of officer-defendants. Three basic approaches have been followed by courts in ruling on dis\u00ad covery of these records in civil cases. Some courts have granted discovery. Ogilvie v. City of New York, 353 N.Y.S.2d 238 (1974). Other courts have permitted limited discovery. Caison v. Scott, 59 F.R.D. 347 (D. Haw. 1973). Thirdly, judges have denied discovery. McMillan v. Ohio Civil Rights Comm'n., 315 N.E.2d 508 (Ohio Ct. C.P. 1974). In allowing interrogatories to discover information about discipline records, the court in Los Angeles v. Superior Court, 109 Cal. Rptr. 365 (1973) stated: These interrogatories seek to discover matters of fact and not opinions, speCUlations or conclusions. Conceivably a particular officer's suspensions could be so numerous and grow out of such serio~s charges that an employer would be put on reasonable notice that the officer was not fitted to perform the duties of a peace officer. Conceivi>blv tI~e dates and reasons for such suspension could serve to wam an employer that the officer was not suited to per\u00ad form, either temporarily or permanently, the particular duties to which he had been assigned. If the suspension record of Officer Murphy were to suggest these possibilities, then an amendment of plaintiffs complaints to add other causes of action might be appIG\" priate. For these reasons we think information about suspensions of Officer Murphy ... is relevant to the subject matter of the action and might become relevant to the issues in an amended complaint. The Superior Court correctly required defendant to answer these interrogatories. Limited discovery including that of factual police reports, has been per\u00ad mitted by several courts, while discovery of evaluative summaries, opinions and 84 DISCIPLINE PROCEDURES AND PROCESSES conclusions has been disallowed. In Boyd v. Gullett, 64 F .R.D. 169 (D. Md. 1974), the court granted limited discovery. Although no general privileges against discovery of police files exists, certain restrictions on discovery would be appropriate. Thus investi\u00ad gatory files relating to investigations currently in progress may properly be withheld. The names of informers, if any, may be deleted from records subject to discovery. Material of a non factual nature, i.e., official criticisms, recommendations of action, policy recommendations or opinions of supervisory personnel may be sub\u00ad mitted to the court for in camera review. Although the latter mate\u00ad rials could well be relevant to the plaintiffs case, some supervision of discovery may be necessary to protect the decision-making process in the various government agencies involved in this case. Because of the delicate information which may appear in the dis\u00ad covered materials, only the plaintiffs' attorneys of record and designated paralegals and law students may see and consider any items discovered as a result of this opinion. Refusal to grant discovery may be based upon confidentiality of internal investigations records, impairment of the department's capacity to investigate misconduct, diminution of the department's ability to control officer accounta\u00ad bility, violation of officers' rights of privacy or imposition of a chilling effect on internal investigations. McMillan v. Ohio Civil Rights Conlin 'n, supra. The rationale of lack of relevancy may not be as persuasive in civil litigation as it has been in criminal cases because cf the greater acceptance by courts of liberal discovery in the former cases than in the latter. In criminal prosecutions, the government may opt for dismissing the prosecution in lieu of pern1itting discovery of police records. Pitchess, supra. This choice is not available to officers and departments that are defendants in civil litigation. In such cases, the police department may protest the discovery, seek to limit the scope of the discovery or request the court to examine the documen ts in camera before turning any of them over to the plain tiff. If internal affairs records are segregated from personnel records, the department may have a stronger argument for confidentiality of internal affairs records than if these records are combined with personnel records. The chilling effect of discovery on internal investigations rather than upon all personnel records should be a com\u00ad pelling argument to the judiciary. 4- The Human Element in Discipline INTRODUCTION All activities of any organizational entity, including operational and special staff units, are defined through management directives and ,J<arried out by individuals. The success of these entities in accomplishing objectives is depend\u00ad ent on human competence and motivation. Specific tasks cannot be completed successfully without well-conceived personal effort and ample direction. Managing the human enterprise has for these reasons become a fundamental and most important task of organizations. Many current issues in law enforcement revolve around this central ques\u00ad tion: How can management make the best use of available resources to confront the day-to-day problems of police administration? This theme pervades all attempts to improve police operations. A recent analysis of the success of pro\u00ad gressive patrol strategies, innovative experiments and sophisticated equipment concluded C1at: In most of these efforts, however, it has been apparent that eventual success depends on the critically important element of human re\u00ad sources. Sound personnel practices, therefore, may well be the single most vital consideration in the quest for effective law enforcement.] ] O. Glenn Stahl and Richard A. Staufenberger, eds., Police Persollnel Administra\u00ad tion (Washington, D.C., 1974), p. iii. 85 \" , I 86 THE HUMAN ELEMENT IN DISCIPLINE In the typical law enforcement agency, many organizational units become involved in carrying out discipline. The authority and responsibility of these units differ by agency, and the amount of input of each often varies according to a particular situation. Units, however, have one thing in common-each is composed of individuals performing necessary tasks in the management of discipline. Since the outcome of disciplinary practices is based on actions by these units, it is clear that discipline cannot be carried out effectively without \"just\" and \"suitable\" behavior by the assigned individuals. In polke organizations, as in other walks of life, it is often difficult to detect and analyze behavioral problems. Analysts of human behavior agree that a myriad of psychological, physiological, and sociological factors affect per\u00ad formance. Thus, it may be difficult to determine why one individual or an aggregate of individuals performs in a particular way. Such analyses, neverthe\u00ad less, are necessary if human behavior is to be understood and controlled-an outcome essential to the achievement of organizational goals and objectives. Private industry has for many years realized the importance of such in\u00ad sight, and in many cases conducted rigorous research for purposes of evaluating performance. By contrast, the study of behavior in the public sector, and especially in law enforcement, is an emerging concern. Much can be learned from the experiences of private enterprise, as well as from the few available studies of behavior in police agencies. Moreover, additional research should be undertaken to obtain further information on job performance. Much insight can be gained not only from intensive research, but from practical every day situations involving human interactions. Differing values, personalities, communications techniques, leadership styles, and roles are all examples of situations that -;:an lead to poor interpersonal relationships which consequently act as deterrents to the achievement of goals and objectives. Man\u00ad agement can and must keep abreast of these potential problem areas by periodically monitoring employee daily performance. This may be accomplished by detecting problem areas, isolating the specific human problems, and develop\u00ad ing strategies to alter attitudes and/or behavior. Unfortunately, many police organizations are not equipped to conduct such analyses and, therefore, are unable to resolve personnel problems. This chapter will explore some typical human problems relating to disci\u00ad pline. Several concepts will be analyzed in light of IACP experience with the seventeen police agencies studied, and from the perspective of tried and tested managerial practices in other types of organizations. Numerous employee-related problems are discussed and recommendations offered. Throughout the chapter, emphasis is placed on the need for management to assume a proactive posture in identifying and rectifying human problems. -- Achieving Effective Manpower Utilization 87 A predominant focus throughout the chapter is on the responsibilities of the chief executive. However, sophisticated management is a team effort; many of the stated concepts and recommendations apply equally to top level com\u00ad manders, mid-management, and supervisory level personnel. A crucial probleIT' in many police organizations ill the failure of these managers to recognize their individual and collective roles in resolving human problems. Such recognition and positive action are needed at all levels of the organization to attain manage\u00ad ment goals and achieve effective diSCiplinary practices. ACHIEVING EFFECTIVE MANPOWER UTILIZATION In most law enforcement agencies, the chief executive is responsible for administering internal discipline. Experienced practitioners and management theorists alike endorse this form of operations. It is not good practice, however, for the administrator to personally assume the authority for completion of all disciplinary tasks. The chief executive's duties are multifaceted; with his or her time usually divided between a variety of administrative responsibilities. The chief may, therefore, be unable to give adequate attention to the numerous dimensions of discipline. In most cases the chief will not, without staff assis\u00ad tance, be able to research and draft policies regarding proper employee conduct, give thorough consideration to the many personnel issues involved in a particular case of misconduct, and monitor the organization to identify potential sources of policy infractions. The chief executive will be able to deal with these tasks appropriately only if a program of staff 3ssistance is devised which \"brings to him the considered judgment and advice of . subordinate personnel, covering a wide range of disciplinary actions.\"2 Such assistance is invaluable not only in large municipal police depart\u00ad ments, but also in suburban and rural agencies. Disciplinary issues have become too complex for an administrator to resolve independently. Court mandates, labor organization agreements, and interest group demands, all accent the need for quick and effective disciplinary practices which will withstand legal scrutiny and be acceptable to both employee and citizens. Because the chief cannot be an expert in all phases of management, it is necessary that staff members capable of rendering proper recommendations in this crucial and sensitive managerial con\u00ad cern be selected and aSSigned specific tasks. As noted in IACP field investigations, many police chief executives do not 2George D. Eastman and Esther Eastman, Municipal Police Administration (Washing\u00ad ton, D.C., 1971), p. 205. J. 88 THE HUMAN ELEMENT IN DISCIPLINE have available the type of staff assistance necessary for effective discipline. There are two primary reasons for this problem. First, many chief executives do not recognize the need for specific staff input. There is a tendency to try and complete all disciplinary related work independently since many decisions are sensitive in nature. Also, many chief executives who do have available staff clo not make appropriate use of their talents. Often, the need for planning and research personnel to review all policies and procedures is overlooked, or similarly, inspections personnel are used only for mundane purposes, such as issuing and inspecting equipment. The potential of these and other work units is not realized because of the narrow perspective of the chief executive. To illustrate, in one agency visited, training personnel were used solely as armorers (those who issue and inspect weapons). They did not participate in either recruit or in-service training programs, and generally were uninformed of any revisions in policy or procedures. This situation is most inadequate. Training personnel should communicate frequently with other staff and operational units to keep apprised of changes in management expectations. Most revisions in policies or procedures should be explained eitller by training personnel or by supervisors. In the event supervisors explain such changes, training personnel should monitor performance to determine if correct expectations are conveyed. Secondly, appropriate staff may not be available due to financial COfl\u00ad straints. In agencies where this problem surfaced, it was generally explained that government officials do not understand the need for such staff input. The feeling was expressed that city or state officials were interested primarily in reducing crime and did not desire to finance programs which could not be related to street activity. A misconception among such officials is that staff efforts do not directly affect on-the-job performnnce. This sentiment may be accurate if the administration is using staff ineffectively, but to simply deny management the tools necessary to support operations is inappropriate. Proper use of staff assistance in the areas of planning, legal review, inspections, and in ternal investi\u00ad gations not only supports openltional personnel, but renders the entire organiza\u00ad tion more effective and makes the realization of goals and objectives'po\"sible. In order to acquire the best qualified staff input, the chief administrator should first engage in human resource planning. SUGh planning is essential for effective management in general and for efficient and just diSCipline in particu\u00ad lar. This concept has been defined as follows: Human resource planning is a department-wide ~ystematic, and coor\u00ad dinated approach to placing an adequate number of the right persons Achieving EffectiJ1e Manpower Utilization in the right places at the right time. It is essential in order to provide for the continuous and proper staffing of the police agency.3 89 Through human resource planning, the administrator can select individuals with special talents. It is a mistake to assume that any successful patrol officer or experienced supervisor may fit the role of a \"planner\" or an \"investigator.\" These positions require unique abilities not possessed by all officers. The chief administrator can identify these skills only through a continuing assessment of personnel capabilities. Chief executives in large departments cannot, in most cases, complete the task of human resource planning without assistance. These executives must delegate this work to specialists with knowledge and experience in conducting personnel planning. It seems only logical that this task should be assigned to the personnel unit. Unfortunately, this often causes difficulty because the agency will not have experienced staff available, such as specially trained personnel experts, to handle these matters.4 Successful human resource planning is based on a six-step approach to select staff members for certain key positions.s The first step concerns the inter\u00ad relationships between organizational planning and manpower; goals and objec\u00ad tives will not be realized unless sufficient manpower is assigned to each task. Most police managers do not seem to give ample consideration to this depend\u00ad ency. Secondly, human resource planning involves the ascertainment of man\u00ad power requirements for particular task requirements, possibly by defining job descriptions. Thirdly, manpower inventories should be undertaken to identify personnel capable of meetin'g job criteria. This task should include skill assess\u00ad ment, as well as the determination of availability. Detemlining \"net manpower requirements\" constitutes the fourth step in planning.6 In this step, the im\u00ad portance of factors such as age, training and experience should be assessed. Decisions made at this stage thell become the basis for action. Once these decisions are made, however, there may be a need for further training in specific areas. This is the fifth phase in the human resource plan. The chief executive 3petcr Smith Ring and Frank Dyson, \"Human Resource Planning,\" ed. O. G. Stahl and R. A. Staufenberger, Police Personnel Administration (Washington, D.C., 1974), p. 460. 4Personnel experts could possibly be recruited as civilian staff, or sworn officers could attend specialized training courses to acquire such knowledge. 5This six-step approach combines models proposed by P. S. Ring and F. Dyson, pp. 45-56, and by Leon C. jl'!eggin,;on, Tile Mallagemellf of People at Work (New York, 1965), pp.405-406. 6The term I'net manpower requirements\" has been used by Megginson to describe the process of assessing the impact of many personal variables on staff mem ber selection. : ';,,) \" H i: 90 THE HUMAN ELEMENT IN DISCIPLINE should carry out the sixth and final stage of the plan by ensuring that the agency is prepared for the future by continuing to identify individuals best suited for certain staff positions. Law enforcement agencies generally have not adopted a human resource planning capability, although some departments are considering methods of per\u00ad sonnel assessment. These agencies are undoubtedly the exception. In conducting field work, the IACP could not identify such thorough planning in any agency studied. Most personnel units are not equipped to carry out such an involved task. The chief executive, in this case, is obliged to personally conduct all human resource planning, possibly with the assistance of an outside firm knowledgeable in this specialized area.? The chief, in such situation, shou).: personally maintain all sensitive information on manpower skills. This is not to say, however, that the agency in this situation could not work toward developing its personnel function to provide data for decision-making. DELEGATING APPROPRIATE AUTHORITY Some police administrators fail to give unit commanders sufficient authority to complete tasks. These executives may feel that since they have ulti\u00ad mate responsibility for all department operations, they sr\\C,Jd take it upon themselves to make sure that all work is completed, even with./..l~ Hdequate time to do so. lt is imperative that, upon analyzing human capabiV ties and selecting unit commanders, the chief executive take steps to ensure that thl!, authority of com\u00ad manders is commensurate with responsibility. The importance of delegating this authority for direct responsibility for the completion of tasks cannot be minimized, for it establishes the \"right to manage\" on the part of division and unit commanders. Most chief administrators in the seventeen agencies studied by the IACP did seem to realize the importance of delegating authority. For the most part, each administrator made an attempt to surround himself by qualified staff mem\u00ad bers who were given authority to get the job done. However, there seemed to be a tendency among some of these administrators to override commanders' authority in sensitive disciplinary cases. If, for example, a serious allegation of brutality surfaced, the chief would be apt to take immediate action without waiting for commanders to conduct a thorough investigation and to make a 7This may be the case, particularly in smaller agencies with limited finances. ~ 1,1 , . , Delegating Appropriate Authority 91 recommendation. It is understandable that the chief would desire to take im\u00ad mediate action when so demanded by public opinion. Nevertheless, the commanders have been given the responsibility to carry out objective and thorough investigations and suggest appropriate action. If the chief con\u00ad tinually subverts this process, commanders may lose the motivation to do a good job and question their actual authority. One problem evident in many police agencies is that first supervisors rarely are delt!gated appropriate authority to detect and resolve disciplinary situations. When they are granted even small amounts of authority, they are often not knowledgeable in the best way of using it, because supervisory responsibilities are not clearly delineated and made known through training programs. One area of specific research in this project was officer perceptions of supervisory actions. It was found by correlating administrative analysis results with questionnaire findings that officer perceptions of supervisors were higher in those agencies which did clearly define first-line management responsibilities and trained supervisors in their role.B In those agencies that did not define the super\u00ad visors' role, it was common practice for these first-line managers to exercise unauthorized responsibilities in diScipline; this situation often led to inconsistent enforcemen t of in ternal rules. Delegating appropriate authority sets the stage for carrying out discipline. It is essential, however, that management realize that certain human factors may limit actual authority to perform tasks. The concept of authority in police organizations brings to mind the formal chain of command in which the superior officers are empowered to control many actions of their subordinates. This conception, however, is rather lin.ited for it frequently implies in bureaucratic organizations only the \"right to command\" and \"duty to obey.\" Perhaps a more complete understanding of authority can be obtained through a discussion of power. Pfiffner and Sherwood have stated tllat power is the politics of how things get done.!) Power in organizations may be held by people without authority. The union official, the old line patrol supervisor, and the expert in a particular field such as law or psychology may all exhibit power in a police organization from the standpoint that they can influence attitudes and behavior. The chief executive, as well as the top subordinates and unit super\u00ad visors, must be able to identify and deal in a positive manner with these indivi- B A statistical difference (significant at the .001 level) was found between the four agencies in which highest scores were noted and four agencies in which lowest scores were obtained. For further information, see Appendix A, pp. 234-238. 9 John M. Pfiffner and Frank P. Sherwood, Administrative Organization (Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: 1960). .1 92 THE I-IUMAN ELEMENT IN DISCIPLINE duals if set policies are to be carried out. Unfortunatdy. this does not always occur in polke organizations because the administrator often refuses to deal with informal leaders, and instead attempts to use more authority for purposes of controlling the organization. Leavitt has addressed the weakness of this a?pro.a:h stating that managers relying on this style of leadership emphasize sImplIcIty and speed in administration. Leavitt points out the disadvantage of this tactic by stating that: [Employees working in such a system] who expect to be censured whenever they are caught loafing may learn to act busy (and when to act busy) and also that the boss is an enemy. They are thereby provided with a challenging game to play against the boss: who can think up the best ways of loafing without getting caugl:\u00b7: a game in which they can feel that justice is on their side and a game they can usually win.! 0 Moreover, the manager's reaction to this situation is often too elementary. When recognizing that authority has been '''undermined' by the 'sabotage' of subordi\u00ad nates, the supervisor ... may assume that what he needs is more authority because authority is the only tool he knows.\"!! ' Such a management style may be inappropriate for contemporary law enforcement. Administrators (both the chief executive and unit commanders) must learn the intricacies of organizational politics and use them to their advan\u00ad ta.ge. This is especially true if these commanders wish to instill in employees the will to voluntarily comply with policies and procedures. Many managers have not yet learned how to apply such principles in nolice or~anizations. Administrators frequently apply the traditional rnanag~ment philosophy that all officers should comply with expectations simply because they are told to do so. This approach is workable in theory, bu t does not result in voluntary compliance. Officers will learn how to \"get around\" such system, as was confirmed by interviews in this project, and thus fail to carry out man\u00ad agement intentions.! 2 A fundamental message for police managers is evident from this discussion. In addition to delegating authority commensurate with responsibility, they must ~~Harold J. Leavitt, Mallagerial Psychology, 3rd_ cd. (Chicago, 1972), pp. Leavitt, pp. 171-175. 12 A sample of ?f~ic~rs ~~as interviewed in each agency. These officers frequently stated that total seJf-dlsclphne may not be a realistic goal in their agency,\" and that man\u00ad agement should endeavor to recognize individual differences. --r: I i Employee Participation in Policy Formulation 93 alert commanders to the pitfalls of managing only through the formal system; any administration which ignores the influence of powerful individuals or groups on employee attitudes and behavior will not achieve full officer compliance to rules and procedures.! 3 ENCOURAGING EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION ON POLICY FORMULATION As with all other forms of police administration, it is important that the chief executive solicit input regarding rules of conduct and disciplinary proce\u00ad dures from all levels of the organization. Both lower echelon and supervisory personnel will undoubtedly have opinions about the efficacy of certain rules and procedures, and will bc able to provide information concerning employee attitudes on particular policies. This input is invaluable to administrators for it enables them to identify the practical ramifications of a change in policy. Such input often may uncover unanticipated consequences leading to probiems in the delivery of police services. Further, this managerial technique facilitates em\u00ad ployee conformance to policies, in that representatives of various ranks have input in the policy formulation. The benefits of participative management have been realized by private industry for many years. Empirical research has demonstrated that several advantages may be gained by bringing employees into the decision-making process. One study in particular. designed to measure the effects of hierarchical as opposed to participative styles of management, indicates that participative techniques result in significant increases in the following: degree of satisfaction with supelvisor's ability to represent employee needs, extent to which managers were perceived to be \"employee oriented,\" and extent to which employees felt respoJ1sibility to see that work gets done.14 This same project concluded that although administrators using hierarchical styles of management may realize short term successes in productivity, \"this increase is obtained ... at a cost to the human assets of the organization.\"! 5 Costs such as 'iincreased hostilities; a greater reliance on authority; decreased loyalties; reduced motivation to pro\u00ad duce, together with increased motivation to reshict production. and increased turnover are the prices management must pay for adhering to non-participatory fonm of administration.,,16 !3For further information. sec Eastman and Eastman, p. 200. 14Rensis Likert,New Pattcms o[Mallagemcllt (New p. 71. !6 Likert, p. 71. I ~ 94 THE HUMAN ELEMENT IN DISCIPLINE Furthermore, other studies have shown that giving employees a voice in the \"how\" and \"when\" of the work process tends to raise self-esteem and en\u00ad hance productive motivation and general performance. Through such processes employees begin to identify with managerial goals and objectives which they have helped establish. Through its examination of disciplinary practices in seventeen law enforce\u00ad ment agencies, the IACP has discovered very few practices which actually work to solicit officer input. This conclusion is supported by a question concerning employee perceptions of the climate for recommending changes in directives. When responding to the statement\" [0] fficers feel free to suggest new or revised written directives to superiors,\" only 49 percent elicited a positive response, 17 percent were uncertain, and 34 percent responded negatively. The fact that in most departments surveyed (ten of sixteen agencies) less than 50 percent of the respondents answered this item positively tends to support the hypothesis that typical law enforcement agencies do not provide adequate mechanisms for establishing participatory management schemes. An analysis of management practices in these agencies indicates that traditional practices such as the \"open door policy\" and the \"suggestion box\" are wholly inadequate. Instead, management should actively seek officer input through an established procedure whereby meetings are held and documentation is maintained, and/or through an informal system designed to enable lower echelon personnel to meet with top management in a very personable and human manner, possibly during off-duty hours away from the headquarters facility. Only a few examples of such procedures were noted in the agencies studied. Four distinct approaches, however, seemed workable and are worthy of mention. In one agency, management appointed separate work groups, consisting of officers of different ranks, to research and draft new policies. These groups developed several new general orders, including a revised hairstyle rule. From all indications, it appears that this approach is workable and resulted in greater officer acceptance of the new rule. One other agency used an informal task force as a sounding board for all new policies, as well as a feedback device for ascertaining employee perceptions of various policies or procedures. This group met once every week and did not use a structured agenda. The group consisted of only patrolmen, and minute.:. of meetings were not kept. In the opinion of departmental staff, informality and lack of documentation was the key to the success of this group in raising several issues of concern to lower echelon personnel and subsequently realizing appro\u00ad priate changes in operation. --~------------------- ..... -.... -........ ---\u00ad~I E'mployee Participation in Policy Formulation 95 The third and fourth techniques selected for discussion here were both used by one organization. The first approach was a formal structured one, whereby officers were permitted to submit memorandums to Planning and Research, suggesting new policies or revisions in current general orders. If the idea was considered worthy of further development, the memo was returned to the suggestor for further input. This technique seemed quite workable in that the officer could continue to be involved in the process and formal documenta\u00ad tion was retained. The only disadvantage may be that Planning and Research, upon being deluged with memorandums, could possibly turn down suggestions with particular merit simply due to a lack of time and/or manpower for ade\u00ad quate review. The second style L.bserved in this agency for soliciting officer opinion was quite informal. The organization's chief executive, during off-duty hours and in civilian clothes, traveled to the homes of officers and met with the individual's entire family. This procedure tended to reduce the formality existing during work hours and enhanced candid conversations and was considered quite satis\u00ad factory among line officers. It gave them a chance to appreciate the problems a chief executive must face, as well as an understanciing of the rationale for particular rules and regulations. The difficulty with this technique is that its success depends on the time availability of the chief executive. This combined formal and informal system of seeking employee sugges\u00ad tions and feedback seemed to establish the feeling among officers that top level managemen t does have the interests of the troops in mind, and therefore tends to instill greater support for administrative decisions and policies. Officers in this agency responded more positively to the question concerning \"feeling free to suggest new or revised directives\" than did officers in any other organization. A total of 72 percent of the respondents elicited affirmative answers, 7 percent were undecilled, and 21 percent answered negatively. These score~ were appre\u00ad .Jably higher than those obtained in any other agency (the amount of agreement was 11 percentage points higher than for any other organization; the amount of disagreement was equal to one other department and five percentage points lower than for any other organization). It can be concluded that the best system for seeking input may utilize both a formal, structured approach as well as an informal style. Two observa\u00ad tions may be made in favor of this combined approach. First, the officer making a suggestion has direct contact with persons of sufficient rank and authority to initiate change-an approach which Vlould seem to produce workable results. And secondly, tllese persons in authority provide some form of recognition to r ' 96 THE I-IUMAN ELEMENT IN DISCIPLINE the officer. Both of these desirable characteristics are absent in traditional forms of ~eeking input. The above techniques of seeking officer input are innovative. The fact that several agencies are experimenting and having success with such concepts demon\u00ad strates that nontraditional styles of management can be effective and should be used to obtain full compliance to directives. Police administrators, through their own experience, are aware of the wide latitude of discretionary power inherent . in the patrol function, and should realize that conformance will not occur solely because an administrative decree is made. Forward 100JrJng executives have implied that the future of professional law enforcement rests with patrol officers who have been trained to use their discretion properly to \"resolve conflicts that threaten public order.\"1 7 However, is it enough to say that police officers can be taught to use their powers cor\u00ad rectly, or will there always be the temptation to stretch the meaning ofa general order to legitimitize certain activity, or to simply ignore managemen t directives altogether with the hope of not getting caught. It is pl)ssible that the latler analysis is more realistic. Management should strive to analyze reasons for non\u00ad compliance and take appropriate steps to correct particular problems. One reason for nonconformance is differing perceptions of police goals. As noted by Johnson during field research, an officer subculture exists, with dis\u00ad tinct norms and values other than those shared by supervisory personnel or top management, having \"the means to neutralize the organizational goals that patrolmen (sic) do not consider 'appropriate' to the role enactment of a patrol\u00ad man (sic).\"18 Through participative management techniques, administrators should be able to identify these expectations of officers and do whatever is possible to integrate these needs with organizational goals. Such an effort may result in the assimilation of management goals and objectives by officers. Examples of differences in goals between management and patrol officers were evident in IACP field research.l 9 Whili: many agencies, through the admin\u00ad istration, selected the admirable goal of accepting and investigating all citizen complaints, only 30 percent of the officers responding to the questionnaire thought that all complaints should be investigated. Also, patrol officers felt 17The National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals Report 011 Police (Washington, D.C.: GPO, 1973), p. 22. ' 18Thomas A. Johnson, \"A Study of Police Resistance to Police Community Relations in a Municipal Police Department\" (Ph.D. dissertation, University of California, Berkeley, 1970), p. 315. 19For a full review of variations in perceptions according to rank and seniority, see Appendix A, pp. 258-261. I I L Employee Participation ill Policy Formulation 97 much more strongly than did supervisors or commanders about officer input in the internal review process. It is the general feeling that patrol officers desire more certainty than is presently evident in disciplinary decision-making. There are several reasons for this apparent lack of sensitivity to seeking input in the planning ano deciSion-making process, not the least of which is the inability of management t,-' create a mechanism for obtaining this input.2 0 I-Iow\u00ad ever, the most dominant influence may be the organizational structure itself and the traditional militaristic mode of operation. By reviewing the principles underlying the bureaucratic model of controlling human behavior as set forth below, it is not difficult to determine that little, if any, room is left for enter\u00ad taining ideas of subordinates and apprising employees of work plans. Tradi\u00ad tional assumptions about decision-making and use of employees do not provide the opportunity for obtaining such inpu t. A review of basic propositions of the traditional, bureaucratic organization highlights reasons for this lack of sensitivity: 1. The only relations that matter between people in organizations are those defined by charts and models; 2. The behavior of people is governed by explicit logical thinking; 3. The subordinate will do what the objectives and circumstances of the organization require if the rules and regulations are clear alld if the incen tives reward their logical behavior; 4. Major problem solving and decision-making are the responsibility of the administrator; 5. The way to get things done is through the power of the leader's position; and 6. Employees will be more efficient if they are not required to be responsible for evaluating the quality of their work.2 1 Creativity is not intentionally stifled in such a system, but rarely occurs due to many impediments. Communication is designed to flow downward in this system with interpersonal interactions occurring on a one-to-one basis between, for example, the officer and his or her sergeant, or the sergeant and the lieu- 20 In many agencies administrators may not be aware of proper methods to use to obtain employee input. 21Chris Argyris, Interpersonal Competence alld Organizational EjjectiJleness (Home\u00ad wood, Illinois: 1962), pp. 36-37. 98 THE HUMAN ELEMENT IN DISCIPLINE tenant. The officer who seeks to suggest a change in policy consequently must submit the idea to the immediate superior and then just hope it is communicated accurately to an individual possessing the experience and authority to either carry the suggestion forward or explain why it is not feasible. There is little opportunity for the officer who initiated the idea to be rewarded if, in fact, the suggestion leads to a change in policy. And even if this input does get to the office of the chief, it is most likely that a high level commander will communi\u00ad cate the idea personally rather than direct the officer to discuss the matter with , the chief. .... ,;::.. ._------ -. Moreover, reliance on the above stated principles is reinforced through promotional processes. Managers developed within this system usually will have little experience in resolving human problems which transcend the bureaucratic structure (e.g., employee morale problems, employee organization demands, etc.). This is unfortunate, for these managers will often come face to face with such problems upon reaching top level positions. Such a system is not conducive to developing strategies for maximizing employee input. It is up to the chief execu live to devise a workable procedure and ensure that managers are trained in its proper use. MONITORING THE ORGANIZATION TO DETECT HUMAN RELATED DEFICIENCIES The chief executive is invariably the last person in the chain of command to be formally apprised of many types of police officer misconduct. The chief must determine why such incidents occurred, as weIl as what appropriate find\u00ad ings and sanctions should be applied. To do this requires that much information be obtained concerning not unly the facts of the case, but also what adminis\u00ad trative actions may have led, either directly or indirectly, to this incident. For example, some questions the chief might ask are: Is the supervisor negligent in not informing the individual officer of police directives, or has the supervisor condoned similar behavior in the past simply because the consequences were not as grave? Was mid-management responsible for not ensuring supervisor objec\u00ad tivityin dealing with personnel problems, or were these managers remiss in not requiring supervisors to document all ,lllegations of improper behavior, regard\u00ad less of severity? Was the division or bureau chief negligent in not recognizing high levels of employee dissatisfaction with and open disregard for a particular policy? Perhaps this commander should have detected serious amounts of line\u00ad supervisor hostility in his division and taken steps to avert any negative occur---I\\d 1.1 Monitoring to Detect Human Related Deficiencies 99 rences. These questions, among others, must be raised by the chief executive if, in fact, the chief is to control organizational disorders creating disciplinary problems. Similar inquiries should also be raised by unit commanders in order to detect and correct problems before they become disciplinary cases. Such prevention does not often occur, however, for in most police organi\u00ad zations internal discipline is crises oriented. As illustrated by the National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals: \"Most agencies simply react to employee misconduct. They do a good job of investigating after incidents have occurred, but they do little to prevent them.,,22 Further, few agencies maintain thorough record systems of disciplinary actions to facilitate analyses of organizational defects tending to create disciplinary situations. Instead, these departments will most likely document within an employee's per\u00ad sonnel jacket only allegations of misconduct together with dispositions. Individual officers often do violate agency norms, and therefore should be sub\u00ad jected to some type of punitive or corrective action. Much can be learned by diagnosing cases, particularly those which tend to reoccur, for offi(;ers may not be completely negligent in their misconduct. A particular policy, for example, because of the way it is worded or eJ(plained may conflict with other directives given the officer, therefore, creating confusion. Or, many human errors, some of which were discussed above, may establish an environment not conducive to good discipline or achieving voluntary compliance to norms and policies. The questions that the administrator must ask in diagnosing these cases are: To what extent was the officer guilty of improper behavior? and To what extent were other factors involved? If accurate responses are obtained to tllese questions, the administrator will most likely learn of many organizational prob\u00ad lems requiring attention. Management must change its tendency of simply looking at the officer who is charged as the sole perpetrator of misconduct, and hence the object of discipline. This approach is not adequate for rectifying organizational problems, as demonstrated by the following experience of the IACP during this project. The chief executive in one large agency was under considerable pressure from the city government to increase the department's responsiveness to citizen complaints. Many instances of misconduct were being publicized, and citizens were alarmed. When tllese cases were processed, often including external hea.\u00ad ings, all adverse results would be reflected on both the chief in terms 0f negative publicity and the officer involved in terms of diSciplinary sanctions. Top com- 22The National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals, p.492. 1 ' 100 THE ~IUMAN ELEMENT IN DISCIPLINE manders and/or mid-level administrators would rarely be affected by the cases. This particular chief became disturbed at these results when realizing that several supervisors had knowledge of previous incidents involving the same officers. These supervisors, however, had failed to take corrective action and document incidents, thereby giving the impression that such activity was not considered serious. Further, mid-management personnel, through past experiences, had not required supervisors to report and document all cases of misconduct. The chief executive resolved this situation by instituting a directive that all allegations of misconduct, regardless of how minor, were to be documented by supervisors, reviewed, and maintained in the office of shift commanders. TIns chief advised his management personnel that, in future incidents, they would be held accountable for omissions of their responsibility or any improper actions. If an officer was to be disciplined and management was found negligent, punitive action would also be taken against the concerned supervisor or commander. This action by the chief seemingly established an atmosphere in which individuals at all levels of the organization recognized their responsibility and therefore took actions to prevent future misconduct. One other problem, as reported to IACP consultants during field work, was a double standard among ranks in complying with rules of conduct. When asked in the employee questionnaire why they felt certain rules were not enforced fairly and reasonably, many respondents replied that \"superior officers do not follow this rule.\" The officers gave this response in regard to many rules, especially the following: use of alcohol off duty, residency, personal debts, hair\u00ad styles, mustaches and beards, and off-duty employment. Apparently, in some agencies management level personnel are not held to a standard of conduct as strict as are subordinates. This practice is detrimental to good discipline and should be corrected. Inconsistent enforcement or a double standard of compliance to rules gives officers the impression that it is not important to abide by these rules. This type of officer reaction is quite natural since perceptions of a particular rule are based not only on formal pronouncements issued by top management, but also on the demeanor, attitudes and behavior of supervisors in communi\u00ad cating and abiding by such rules. As stated previously, the essence of a rule is its inflexibility. If exceptions are to be made, it is far better to completely eliminate the particular rule. To do otherwise simply weakens the department's policy respecting rules. As stated by Whisenand and Ferguson: Tile success of internal controls as applied to such matters appears to be dependent upon two major factors: (1) the attitude and commit-Recognizing Value Conflicts and Differing Expectations ment of the head of the agency to policies being enforced and (2) the degree to which individual officers and especially supervisory officers have a desire to conform.2 3 101 If the policy of the department is strict enforcement to rules, then all members, individual officers and supervisory personnel, must abide by the standard. Here c:gain, the often-neglected role of the supervisor is vital. While super\u00ad visors are frequently given primary responsibility for explaining new or revised written directives (normally at roll call), they receive little or no training in skills necessary to make such explanations properly. Additionally, the explana\u00ad tion given to supervisors of new rules and the rationale behind them is often inadequate? 4 Supervisors should be trained in the explanation function and apprised of the vital importance of accuracy. Those who do not recognize the importance of this task, or do not explain directives in a thorough and clear manner, will probably not elicit as much confidence among subordinates as supervisors who do explain changes in rletail. 2 S RECOGNIZING VALUE CONFLICTS AND DIFFERING EXPECTA nONS A concern in contemporary police management is the lack of recognition by chief executives and other key administrators of shifts in organizational and societal values. Several proponents of change in police administration have sug\u00ad gested that the manager must operate within the framework of these changes and recognize that all organizational actions will be judged at least in part by individuals with varying value systems. The chief executive must be able to identify and control value conflicts between the organization and the com\u00ad munity, and among staff and line members. Individual members come to the police department with a set of their own values and often are influenced through societal pressures to retain their philoso\u00ad phies or pOSSibly to adopt new values. Additionally, internal value conflicts often arise concerning methods of accomplishing a particular job, or between 23Paul M. Whisenand and R. Fred Ferguson, The Managing of Police Organizations (Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: 1973), p. 199. 24When asked in interviews why they did not explain changes in policy, supervisors in several agencies visited stated that management had not informed them of the change. 2 SThe ability of supervisors to explain directives was one important difference in those agencies with highest perceptions of supervisors and those with low ratings. A statis\u00ad tical difference (significant at the .001 level) was found between these two groups. Further information may be found in Appendix A, pp. 234-238. . ''1 102 THE HUMAN ELEMENT IN DISCIPLiNE differing levels of the organization (e.g., the chief and high level commanders may foHow one value system which differs appreciably from those of super\u00ad visory personnel or line members). Such conflict is not necessarily harmful. In fact, it is considered an attribute of a healthy organization. Active debate be\u00ad tween the chief executive and top commanders on a proposed policy, for example, is often beneficial in that alternative strategies for achieving quick implementation and officer adherence are identified. And, differences in opinion among mid-management personnel regarding methods of securing compliance to this policy may lead to the development of more workable supervisory tech\u00ad niques for coping with rule violatioll'>. Unfortunately, however, this conflict in expectations does have negative implications which limit conformity to rules and policies. It is the responsibility of the chief executive and other administrators to identify these harmful con\u00ad flicts and to devise a method of integrating the myriad of values inherent in the organization so as to best achieve managerial goals. This is often a most difficult task for police management, and in mal1Y cases, is not accomplished satisfac\u00ad torily. To illustrate, one objective for effective management is uniformity in disciplinary practices, regardless of rank, assignment or other criteria. Although many police administrators may ascribe to this goal and enact general orders setting forth their expectations, it is often difficult to achieve full compliance among employees. Managers at all levels of the organization use different methods of resolving incidents of misconduct. Such practices range from the formal processing and documentation of all incidents, irrespective of how minor, to mere oral admonishment for most cases of improper behavior. Many factors affect this decision-making process. However, tl:e most pre\u00ad dominant influence may be the value system of the manager. Does this adminis\u00ad trator, for example, believe that first time violators should only be warned verbally, with no records being maintained of the specific action? Or, will he or she be f,rone to issue formal records of all warnings, records that may be sent to the personnel division, maintained within the particular work unit and/or kept by the individual manager in a personal record system? Additionally, managerial values often influence enforcement practices concerning rules of conduct. While a manager will demand strict adherence to grooming and personal conduct standards, he or she may Lnd to overlook minor violations of operational policies due to a feeling that the nature of police work dictates that a wide latitude in enforcement discretion should be given the patrol officer. Another supervisor, perhaps working in the same division, may feel that infringements of operational policies have more serious consequences for the organization than do violations of rules on personal conduct. It is easy to see -. Recognizing Value Conflicts and Differing Expectations 103 why such variations may present serious problems of inconsistent disciplinary practices. Personal value structures in police organizations frequently lead to a double standard of justice. The IACP has learned that too often misconduct by mid-management or top level administrators is apt to be treated less severely than would similar actions by patrol officers. Further, seniority and personality seem to have an impact on the nature of dispositions, as indicated through field interviews. Both of these inconsisiencies are detrimental to effective diScipline. The employee questionnaire used in the IACP study provides evidence that officers of divergent ranks were treated differently. When asked if \"the internal review process (the system whereby cases are forwarded through the chain of command and a decision rendered) worked consistently for officers of any rank charged with misconduct,\" 47 percent of all respondents answered negatively, while 28 percent were uncertain and 24 percent responded posi\u00ad tively. The results showed further that for sixteen of the seventeen departments studied, 40 percent or more of the respondents elicited negative answers. These findings certainly suggest a disparity in discipline according to rank. Field interviews and reviews of disciplinary records serve to confirm this finding, as well as the conclusion that officers in different divisions are often afforded varying treatment. In one organization in particular, the patrol unit commander indicated that a varying standard of conduct existed between the patrol division and the investigation division. He stated that tins disparity was widely known and is the cause of much dissatisfaction throughout the depart\u00ad ment. Apparently, actions of patrol officers were viewed much more strictly than those of investigative personnel. This inconsistency, from all indications, occurred due to the feeling that detectives have reached a certain plateau in their career where they may act more independently and will, as a result of their experience and professionalism, tend not to violate norms of conduct as fre\u00ad quently as patrol officers. This feeling may, in fact, have merit in some organi\u00ad zations, but as indicated through IACP investigations, is not justified by actual conditions in many agencies. In one other agency, IACP consultants were told that investigators actually did engage in more incidents of misconduct than did patrol officers. This was not the first indication of such difference.26 Problems of misconduct in the investigative unit are exacerbated by the greater latitude and autonomy enjoyed by these officers. The opportunity for improper behavior in this unit may be 26Bernard Cohen, The Police Internal Administration of Justice in New York City (New York, 1970), p. 19. .\" . \" ' , 104 THE I-IUMAN ELEMENT IN DISCIPLINE greater and less likely to be detected. The misconception that detectives do not require close scrutiny in the performance of their duties is thus invalid. There is an evident need for management to realize this and act promptly to correct such problems. Such an inconsistency restricts achievement of managerial objectives, for once improper behavior is overlooked policies will most likely not be practiced uniformly. This is a necessary prerequisite to achieving internal control of police misconduct as indicated by the National Advisory Commission: Once policy is uniformly applied throughout the police agency, prosecution policies and those of police agencies can be coordinated at the administrative level rather than handled case-by-case by opera\u00ad tional personnel. 27 Not all value conflicts stem from internal conditions in the policy agency. Frequently, individual officers are influenced by members of their family, friends, individuals with whom they come in contact while on the job, and by pervasive social values. The present age of an increased emphasis on personal independence in both work and non-work related matters exemplifies a value pattern with particular relevance for police administration. Such values affect the performance of all individuals, and thus organizational entities. This impact may lead to both an overt and a covert disregard for managerial policies, especially if values are shared by groups of officers. Unfortunately, such impli\u00ad cations have not always been realized in police organizations. It has been assumed that personal values will be considered less important than organiza\u00ad tional goals and therefore not affect individual performance. Studies in other bureaucratic institutions have shown such a philosophy to be inappropriate and have indicated that values are not easily changed. Many times such values are semiconscious, manifesting themselves only when challenged. Variations in value judgments of patrol officers and administrators were clearly demonstrated in this project. Patrol officers in general, and oftentimes mid-management personnel, expressed considerable discontent with internal rules governing off-duty conduct (e.g., moral conduct, off-duty employment, residency) and personal behavior (e.g., hairstyles). Those officers who disagreed with these rules did so primarily because they felt that such action was \"none of the department's business,\" or that such rules \"place undue restrictions on my 27The National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals, p. 24. Coping With Role Conflicts 105 personal rights.\" There was a mClrkedly different attitude for these rules between younger patrol personnel and senior administrators. When sensing unfairness or inconsistency in disciplinary matters, officers may feel that essential fairness does not exist, and therefore rebel against the organization either by becoming apathetic or by ignoring policies and procedures to whatever extent possible. Similarly, rules and regulations perceived as overly restrictive on personal rights may be violated either openly (e.g., by growing one's hair longer) or covertly (e.g., by knowingly violating a policy on use of force). The importance of these situations in the management of discipline cannot be minimized. To control behavior, the administrator must identify personal value conflicts and take appropriate steps to alter either behavior or attitudes. This is not an easy task, but one which should be accomplished. A combination of psychological and sociological techniques has been con\u00ad sidered the most favorable strategy for modifying attitudes and behavior. 28 The utilization of such techniques is becoming an increasingly important managerial function, especially in regard to handling diSciplinary problems. The adminis\u00ad trator should consider these approaches and adopt methods which permit successful handling of value conflicts. COPING WITH ROLE CONFLICTS Just as value conflicts may restrict achievement of organizational goals, role conflicts between individual members and among groups or work units may adversely affect performance. Role conflicts are pervasive in all organizations and can produce intense emotional strain and dissatisfaction. The degree to which undesirable factors occur tends to be dependent on management's ability to detect and reduce conflict, as well as the individual's capacity to cope with these phenomena through psychological adjustment. Role conflict in law en\u00ad forcement takes many forms; the administrator's inability to resolve such con\u00ad flict has been detrimental to effective discipline. A common type of role conflict in law enforcement is competition be\u00ad tween divisions, bureaus, sections or other work units. This conflict stems largely from specialization and division of labor. In police organizations, goals and objectives are set hy the administration and determine overall direction for all work units. A certain amount of flexibility is given to each unit, however, so that each entity may develop strategies to achieve its portion of the total job. 28Several management theorists present prototype plans for influencing behavior and attitudes. One excellent treatment of this subject is provided by Leavitt, pp. 171-175. I ,., .. \" 106 THE HUMAN ELEMENT IN DISCIPLINE This sub-organization is often characterized in police agencies by distinctive sets of policies and procedures for each division. Such sub-organization is necessary, but tends to create competition in that each element may act at cross purposes. This condition was observed through field investigations in several agencies. In one organization, professional jealoL'sy and competition were readily apparent. These qualities are not necessarily harmful, but when coupled with altering disciplinary practices, such as varying standards of conduct and different methods of disposing of investigations, they produce negative results. Divisional competition in this agency, as well as in other sample organiza\u00ad tions in which intergroup conflict was apparent, was accompanied by a lack of communication, a lack of understanding, a sense of hontility, and \"perceptual distinction and mutual negative stereotyping.\" These problems were readily evident betwel;n shifts in one division. Each of these conditions tends to limit organizational uniformity, in that unit members sense a lack of consistency in the methods of handling discipline, and hence may be less inclined to follow organizational policies. Another example of intergroup role conflict occurs between the internal investigations unit and operational units. The previously cited comment con\u00ad cerning intergroup stereotyping applies specifically in this case. The IACP dis\u00ad covered that there is little officer understanding of what internal investigations does, as well as a great distrust of officers assigned to this unit. Such perceptions stem apparently from a lack of communication and little sensitivity to the diffi\u00ad cult job undertaken by internal investigators. Officers and detectives alike tend to view internal investigators as the \"hatchetmen who sneak around the organi\u00ad zation attempting to get the goods on everyone.\" This perception, while obviously exaggerating the investigative function, is nevertheless a serious con\u00ad cern in police agencies. Questionnaire results confirmed this conclusion. A total of 34 percent of all respondents responded negatively to the statement \"I have a good under\u00ad standing of the responsibilities of this department's unit for internal investiga\u00ad tions,\" and 19 percent stated that they were uncertain (a result which may be interpreted as undesirable). Mistrust and cynicism toward this unit may have skewed these answers. However, these feelings and a lack of knowledge were undoubtedly caused by management's failure to adequately explain the internal affairs function in recruit or in-service training. This conclusion is supported by analyzing results in departments where the internal affairs role was clearly delineated in directives, and/or covered in training programs. Internal investiga\u00ad tion duties and responsibilities were more clearly documented in two depart\u00ad ments in which officers displayed greater understanding. 1 I - Coping With Role Conflicts 107 Furthermore, much can be said for programs designed to increase aware\u00ad ness and understanding of the internal affairs function. One program involves the transference of officers out of internal affairs every two years in order to limit psychological stress on the part of the investigators. It has also been con\u00ad sidered advisable in some organizations to assign many individual officers to internal affairs for one or two days so they become familiar with the investiga\u00ad tor's role. Such a program may be successful in reducing hostility, since officers will be better able to understand the need for internal affairs and the sensitivity of this work function. Tactics such as the above have merit and should be considered for use in all police agencies. These techniques may be successful due to the priority of establishing workable channels of communication and common goals among organizational units. Recognition of common problems may result from such an approach and serve as a precursor of mutual cooperation. Applying this approach to police organizations, positive results may be obtained by having top commanders of the patrol unit and the investigation unit agree to common goals. For example, a decrease in citizen complaints or the speedier processing of all complaints may be mutually acceptable objectives established to enhance achievement of organizational goals. Too often, however, these approaches are not initiated, and each unit is left to resolve disciplinary problems as it sees fit with little or no input from other concerned work groups. Such is the case with competing divisions and between an operational unit and internal affairs or inspections unit. While the value of recognizing and successfully coping with intergroup conflict is an indispensable managerial function, it is also important that admin\u00ad istrators learn to deal with intragroup conflict; that is, conflict which occurs within groups because of personality differences, varying frames of reference, and divergent expectations. Each of these situations may seriously restrict achievement of organizational goals if not resolved successfully. The supervisor and mid-manager in law enforcement must recognize that individuals are influenced by groups other than that formal unit to which they are assigned. Such influence is often manifested by subgroups or informal entities which may alter opinions and set differing expectations. Schein has stated that three types of informal groups exist within complex organizations. First, it is his contention that horizontal groups exist consisting of individuals of apprOXimately the same rank. Secondly, vertic.;l groups made up of individuals within the same bureau or division often share common feelings and aspirations based on the type of work they do (officers of different ranks in the traffic division or the investigative unit may belong to a vertical group). And finally, i'; --------------------------------~~~ ................ I~.----aM rt 108 TI-IE HUMAN ELEMENT IN DISCIPLINE mixed groups exist drawing individuals from many entities into a common bond (the most typical example of this group in law enforcement is the employee organization).29 Additionally, the individual's frame of rderence may not be based totally on membership in formal and informal groups; that is, this officer does not have to be a membel of the group to accept the group's definition of a particular situation and act accordingly. The police officer may be influenced by several groups, those to which he or she may aspire, and those which enjoy status within the organization. All influences do not emanate solely from groups. The individual officer may be persuaded by a partner. or by another officer whom he or she may emulate. The term \"peers\" is often used to distinguish such frames of referetce, although this phrase may imply common rank or area of assignment. Finally. frames of reference may be either positive or negative. Both forms of input serve as determinants of individual perceptions of events and hence attitudes and behavior. To illustrate, one patrol officer may perceive an em\u00ad ployee organization position calling for increased employee input into the disciplinary process as favorable, although this officer may not be a member of the union. As a result, this officer may show some hesitancy to express this view, and bide his or her time waiting to see how others react. When this officer ascer\u00ad tains that a previous partner, whom the officer dislikes, opposes this position the officer may be more apt to come out in favor of the union stance. In this instance, two inputs from the employee's frame of reference have helped guide the decision. The important message in this analysis is that individuals do have different expectations and therefore one managerial strategy will not always work satis\u00ad factorily for all employees. All police administrators, whether they be top level executives or first-line supervisors, should be aware of such human differences existing in the work group. Management should then develop al ternative strategies for coping with role differences. This is perhaps one of the more effec\u00ad tive ways to achieve compliance with organizational norms. It may be necessary to devise alternate explanations and control strategies to gain compliance with new policies and procedures. While one group of patrol officers may immediately see the need for a particular general order, others may not, due to varying role expectations or other problems. The second group of 29Edgar H. Schein, Organizational Psychology (Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: 1965), p.83. . , I' i Coping With Role COllflicts 109 officers may, however, indicate understanding when asked direct questions by their supervisor, and then not follow this policy in field operations. A strong supervisor should be able to detect any signs of confusion or resentment in the work group and take appropriate action to ensure con\u00ad formance, whether this necessitates individual counseling sessions or strict admonishment to control improper behavior. Such actions are often taken once improper behavior is detected. However, to be successful, a supervisor must act before the undesirable conduct occurs. To do so, he or she should be aware of individual strengths and weaknesses of work groups, and be familiar with expec\u00ad tations and individual peculiarities. This, in essence, is proactive management which identifies problems before they take place and applies steps to correct improper behavior. As stated by Likert: Supervision is, therefore, a relative process. To be effective, and to communicate as in tended, a leader must always adapt his behavior to take in to accoun t the expectations, values, and in terpersonal skills of those with whom he is interacting.3D He states further that 110 simple set of supervisory practices will always yield the best results. and that perceptions of supervisory actions are affected by many variables. However, it is this percepWm which leads to a particular reaction on the part of the subordinate. The message is clear-supervisors must adapt mana\u00ad gerial behavior to individuals and group differences, especially if they expect to achieve compliance to organizational goals and objectives. First-line supervisors have key roles to play in inducing compliance. It is this individual who, because of day-to-day contact with SUbOrdII1ates, is most familiar with individual pe\u00ad culiarities and therefore should be more aware than anyone of what it takes to achieve motivation in subordinates. Unfortunately, supervisors do not seem to make the best use of their role. As is indicated by the field questionnaire used in this project, the majority of patrol officers had very favorable impressions of their supervisors.3 1 First-line 30 Likert, p. 95. 31 A detailed analysis of supervisory behavior showed that 77 percent of all officers surveyed either strongly agreed or Jgreed with a variety of supervisory actions, while 20 per\u00ad cent wcre uncertain and 3 percellt expressed either disagreement or strong disagreement. Further information on this subject may be obtained in Appendix A, pp. 234-238. ,. \" : J i I. ,-110 THE HUMAN ELEMENT IN DISCIPLINE managers, in most cases, were perceived favorably, because they did not exercise their full authority to correct improper behavior. 32 It is the responsibility of mid-management to determine when supervisors are remiss in their duties and take appropriate action. From all indications of this research, such action rarely occurs. The interpretation should not be made that managing according to indivi\u00ad dual differences will lead to a compromising of organizational policies. Goals and objectives as delineated in rules and general orders should not be altered for individual convenience. The task at,hand is one of \"integrating\" group and individual objectives with organizational policies. ACHIEVING INTEGRATION Several managerial traits designed to achieve integration have been evalu\u00ad ated in private industry, and in many cases, have been proven effective. Many of these techniques could be utilized by executives, mid-managers or supervisors of any law enforcement agency to realize integration of organizational goals with individual needs. It should be remembered, however, that these concepts are not 'panaceas which can be adopted easily. It takes leadership to pu t these principles in prac\u00ad tice and make them work. This implies more than mere supervision which is used to carry out day-to-day duties or fill \"role prescriptions\" (those basic acts required of an individual in a job description).3 3 Leadership goes beyond simply expecting mechanical obedience to directives. To be an effective leader the , manager should take into consideration personal differences and needs, and by acting within parameters of situations, ensure that individual goals and organiza\u00ad tional needs are integrated to the best possible extent. The quality ofleadcrship is a fundamental determinant which should not be overlooked in the manage\u00ad ment of discipline. The following discussion of managerial traits is presented to provide examples of strategies which have been used to realize better productivity in organizational units, improved attitudes toward management, a reduction in . 32Through .intervie.ws, it was le~rned that many supervisors will ignore many acts of misconduct, or Simply give oral warnmgs to officers for repeated incidents meriting either more serious punishment or some form of retraining. 33Th t \"I . t' \"h b e erm ro e prescnp IOns as een used to denote those activities which are auth?rized through the formal organization and undertaken to complete certain tasks. Use of tlus term, however, does not imply management of the human enterprise. A chieving Integration 111 absenteeism, and overall conformance to management directives. For the most part, these managerial techniques have not been used to a great extent in police organizations, and were not readily noticeable in IACP investigations. Certainly, it would be desirable to test the effects of such managerial styles in police agencies. Tllis is a task for fu ture research. Using Supportive Relationships An individual's reaction to management directives is predicated largely by his or her perception of that directive. It is therefore essential that supervisors recognize how employees see things and consider these perceptions when evaluating performance. Further, the subordinate expects a supervisor to behave in a manner that is consistent with the boss's personality, and behavior which is contrary to this expectation may cause confusion and resentment. In essence, all employee reactions are affected by individual background, experience and expectations. To cope with variations in these phenomena, supervisors should take steps to: Ensure a maximum probability that in all interactions and all rela\u00ad tionships with the organization each member will, in light of his background, values and expectations, view the experience as sup\u00ad portive and one wllich builds and maintains his sense of personal worth and importance.34 As indicated from the IACP research, this principle is not applied fre\u00ad quently in police agencies. Perceptions do differ by such background characteris\u00ad tics as seniority, experience in discipline, experience in suggesting changes in the organization, and perhaps most strongly satisfaction with one's career and assignment.35 However, police administrators seem, for the most part, to manage through the formal channels with emphasis on authority rather than consideration. 34Likert, p. 103. 35 A complete review of significant correlations between perceptions and background factors may be found in Appendix A, pp. 258-261. 112 Increasing Managerial Competence and Knowledge of Expectations THE HUMAN ELEMENT IN DISCIPLINE Employee perceptions of administrative goals and objectives are influ\u00ad enced largely through the supervisor's ability to adequately explain policies, his or her capacity for resolving confusion regarding the proper method of carrying out a certain task, and his or her propensity for adhering personally to these expectations. Therefore, it is extremely important that all supervisors, regardless of rank, become fully aware of management intentions and be trained in methods to carry them out. Training of supervisors should take place at three levels: an intensive initial training program to introduce new supervisors to their roles as managers, in-service training to review and expand on the principles espoused in the initial training program, and speCialized instruction on new rules, explaining the meaning and rationale of each. Of these three, the last two have been neglected in many of the police organizations studied. Based on IACP field investigations, subordinates in many departments do not perceive supervisors to exhibit overall competence. When asked in interviews \"How well are supervisors able to explain directives and indicate the need for such policies?\" many officers responded that supervisors were not able to do so \"because they did not understand the directive themselves.\" Such result occurs in many instances because of inadequate supervisory training and poor mid\u00ad management practices in communicating policies. Working with Groups to Achieve Organizational Goals As previously discussed, the importance of both formal and informal work groups cannot be minimized. After identifying group memberships and frames of reference, the supervisor should use the work group as a means to accomplish certain tasks, and take steps to mold the organizational unit into a cooperative one with peer group loyalty and a high level of interpersonal communication. The line supervisor, in following this approach, should measure perform\u00ad ance of the shift as a whole, and by collaborating with the unit, set realistic goals for the work group. When directives are issued, this supervisor would make sure that the entire shift is aware of proposed changes in operation. He or she should also establish a system of mutual support whereby if one officer is confused over a certain policy, other officers will give assistance. If resentment or morale prob\u00ad lems in the work unit are apparent, the ,upervisor should use the impact of the grou p to resolve these problems. Although not rese::trched specifically, it was evident in field research that \u00b7-l! I I I I i ;, I, A chieving Integration 113 most supervisors do not make full use of the work group to achieve tasks. Instead, there is an ever present reliance on individual performance. Most assess\u00ad ments of productivity are determined through individual measures. Improving Morale mid Motivation The concepts of employee morale and motivation have been the subject of considerable research, and in some cases a dimension of focus in organizational development. Simply put, the problem in police organizations is motivating em\u00ad ployees to conform to managerial directives. A spin-off question concerns measures of motivation in relation to productivity. Both of these tools of analy\u00ad sis are new concepts in law enforcement which have not, in most agencies, been utilized fully or evaluated. There is little evidence to conclude that high morale leads to better pro- ductivity (largely due to inadequate measures of productivity); or in the realm of discipline, that overall satisfaction and acceptance of norms of conduct leads to self-conformance to policies and procedures. However, it has been demon\u00ad strated that employees are not motivated solely by authoritarian styles of management or by an administration accenting performance over employee needs. The individual officer has far greater needs than pure monetary reward for performance. In addition, each officer is motivated by physiological needs, safety needs, belongingness needs, esteem needs, and self-actualization needs.:> 6 Formal, authoritarian styles of management oftentimes meet the first three of this hierarchy of needs, but do little to satisfy personal needs for social esteem and self-fulfillment in a task well done. Further, evidence exists showing that \"employee-centered\" supervision promotes resolution of morale problems and has desirable effects on performance. The significance of this approach becomes noticeable in all areas of supervisor-subordinate in teraction. Certainly, the time has come for law enforcement to experiment with these concepts, as well as others, and to develop accurate measures for evaluating performance and productivity. It is not enough to say that the officer will abide by rules and procedures simply because directives are promulgated by manage\u00ad ment. Experience shows that this approach in itself is not satisfactory, in that 361t has been suggested through rigorous research that individuals ~ossess both con\u00ad scious and sub-conscious needs. Abraham Maslow has postulated that a 1!1~rarchY o.f needs exists and that man is continually motivated to reach the top level of thIS pyramId, thus realizing self-actualization. For further information on this subject see A. H., Maslow, \"~ Theory of Human Motivation,\" Readings in Managerial Psychology, ed. J. LeaVitt and LoUIS R.Pondy (Chicago, 1964), , r'\u00b7 I 0, 114 THE HUMAN ELEMENT IN DISCIPLINE many officers knowingly violate policies and procedures. It is idealistic to assume that management will always be able to integrate the needs of individuals and work groups with the goals and objectives of the administration. However, tn.any behavioral problems may be resolved by this approach. To be able to cope wIth these problems successfully is an objective seldom realized in police ~genci~s. This objectiv~ should be the utmost priority if, in fact, managerial mtentlOns are to be carned out as designed. u ___ f! ! 1 I! U 5 A Guide To Key Operational Requirements For Effective Discipline The practicing police manager with specific interests and needs regarding disci\u00ad pline will want to evaluate the possibility of making organizational changes. Change is possible at many points in a department's operations. Three important areas to explore were chosen as the topics of the preceding chapters: the tools of discipline, the processes used, and the people involved. As a guide to the operational factors which bear most directly on the effectiveness of discipline, this chapter is a compilation of principles and sugges\u00ad tions in the form of concise statements. Each statement is indexed by page number to passages in the preceding chapters which elaborate on the principle and point to specific management actions for implementation. The first section of statements refers to the structural resources of manage\u00ad ment which are analyzed in Chapter Two. Improving the design and use of these tools, such as units for inspection, investigation and research, will lay a founda\u00ad tion for solving many discipline problems. When these recommended actions are taken together with those in the other two areas, an integrated approach to organizational change is developed. 115 _.'-,-- , 116 A GUIDE TO KEY OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS PRINCIPLES FOR IMPROVING THE USE OF STRUCTURAL RESOURCES It is important to define goals and objectives for the organiza\u00ad tion in the disciplinary area, just as it is for any other aspect of Page No. organization can be developed into \"organizational sensors\" to provide information and ideas for the continuous monitoring and improvement of resource available to management for direction and con- trol of the organization is a set to issue written directives should be clearly designated, and the five types of directives (rules and regulations, policies, procedures, instructional material, and memorandums) should be used consistently for their intended must be legal (having been evaluated by a legal advisor), acceptable to those affected (having taken into account the input of officers' opinions), understandable, current, and controlled with regard should be documented to control the issuing of directives at the various levels of system of classification and numbering for easy and accurate reference is of distribution must be developed to assure that everyone affected by an order receives a copy ............... .

The need for written directives-establishing rules of conduct and procedures for handling discipline cases-has been clearly shown. Some recommendations have been made regarding specific policies and proce\u00ad dures. This chapter now seeks to implement the policies discu~sed by translating them into prototype general orders. These prototypes, establishing rules of con\u00ad duct and discipline procedures, are intended to StH' as guidelines or references for administrators who wish to modify their di!i\", .ine systems along the lines suggested in this report. The prototypes are written in the format of some departmental general orders, but the descriptive or Hlustrative commentary found in many general orders has been eliminated from the rules and procedures. Following each sec\u00ad tion, however, is a commentary section which explains the policy considerations and legal principles underlying the sectio)1 and illustrates its application. This commen tary may be used by a drafting committee as a guideline in adapting the models to local use or may be developed into a training resource document to accompany the implementation of the prototype. The prototypes are drafted to reflect legal principles and policies which are broadly applicable to law enforcement agencies today. They do not take into account local political or legal factors. The procedural model also assumes that the police internal discipline process is self-contained and totally under the 125 J.. 126 DESIGNING RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR DISCIPLINE control of the chief administrator of the department. In many jurisdictions statutes, court decisions, departmental organization, local custom, and other factors will require extensive modification of the prototypes. Also, the type and size of the law enforcement agency may have a bearing on the applicability of particular sections to the agency. In utilizing the prototypes for individual departments, consideration must be given to the interrelationship of various aspects of the rules and procedures, so that changes in one section are not made without attention to effects on other parts of the system. The prototypes include only the fundamental provisions or structures necessary to the efficient functioning of the system. While many departments have incorporated into rules of conduct and procedure much more than is included in these models, it is recommended that general orders on diScipline be limited to those provisions which may be dealt with effectively in one or two short paragraphs. More elaborate rules, requiring several paragraphs or pages for presentation should be dealt with in a separate general order on the specific topic. Finally, the models assume the presence of various units within the depart\u00ad ment; however, these units themselves owe their existence to some other depart\u00ad mental mandate. For example, substantial responsibility for handling internal discipline matters is delegated to the Internal Affairs Division, but the existence of such a unit depends upon its establishment in some other departmental general order. Thus, to some extent these models are not self-contained. The department seeking to adapt the prototypes must be aware that other regula\u00ad tions or general orders may be necessary in order for the model system to function (see Figure 6.1). Also, several rules refer to established departmental procedures or are in need of examples for clarification. These procedures and examples should be set out in separate general orders that delve into specific provisions and situations. For a complete understanding of these prototypes, reference should be made to the commentalY follOWing each section, to the earlier discussion, and to AppendixB. PROTOTYPE RULES OF CONDUCT \u00a7 1.01 Violation of Rules Officers shall not commit any acts or omit any acts which constitute a violation of any of the rules, regulations, directives or orders of the Department, whether stated in this General Order or elsewhere. .J Introduction DEPARTMENTAL GENERAL ORDER -----------\u00ad POLICE DEPARTMENT Index as: Internal Affairs Division Procedures for Handling Allegations Against Departmental Personnel/Procedures DATE FUNCTIONS OF INTERNAL ,4,FFAIRS DIVISION PURPOSE: The purpose of this order is to establish responsibility for the cen\u00ad tralization of authority over investigations into complaints made against Departmental procedures or personnel. This responsibility shall be assi!]ned to the Internal Affairs Division. I. INTERNAL AFFAIRS PROCEDURES A. Overview of Responsibilities As described in this order, Internal Affairs Division (lAD) shall be the centralized authority for maintaining control over all internal affairs activities. lAD's responsibilities shall include the following: 1. Maintain staff control over all internal investigations. 2. Maintain a central file of all complaints against service/personnel. 3. Maintain a control log for complaints against service/personnel. 4. Notify by letter the citizen (unless the complainant is anonymous) making a complaint that the complaint is being investigated. 5. Notify the attornp.y (city, county or state) of matters which may result in civil action against the department. B. lAD Responsibility for Review, Assignment and Staff Control Over Internal Investigations. 1. lAD shall review each complaint received by the department. lAD shall assign a control number to each complaint received and record the number in a log book and on the lAD copy of the Com\u00ad plaint Form. The numbering system shall be sequential, prefixed by the year (for example, 75-001. 75-002,75-003, etc.). 2. The Commander of lAD shall decide on responsibility for perform-127 ing the investigation as follows: J a. investigatory responsibility may be assigned to the accused officer's commander. b. the investigation may be performed by lAD. Fig. 6.1 General order for internal affairs division 128 DESIGNING RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR DISCIPLINE 3. lAD will assume responsibility for the investigation under the following circumstances: a. when directed to do so by the Chief of Police. b. when the matter is such that security is desirable until the inves\u00b7 tigation is completed. c. when the investigation is so complex that it would be impractical for the accused officer's commander to undertake the task. d. when several officers of various commands are involved. 4. If the officer, who originally interviewed the complaining citizen, indicates on the report that the complaint was resolved to the citi\u00ad zen's satisfaction, the lAD shall recontact the citizen (by telephontl or in person) to acknowledge receipt of report and determine if the citizen is fully satisfied. a. If the citizen indicates satisfaction and no further action appears warranted, the case shall be closed. b. If the citizen indicates satisfaction, but, in the judgment of the lAD Commander, further investigation is warranted, the case shall remain active and investigatory responsibility assigned as described in Section B,2 above. c. If the citizen indicates dissatisfaction with the action, the lAD Commander shall assign the active investigation as indicated in Section B,2 and determine the reason for the reporting officer's closure. 5. When the complaint is assigned for investigation, either to be con\u00ad ducted by lAD or the accused officer's commander, a 3 x 5 \"Pend\u00ad ing Card\" shall be completed. This card shall identify the lAD investigator responsible for the case or the commander to whom the case was referred. The card shall also state the date on which the investigation shall be completed. All investigations shall be com\u00ad pleted 10 calendar days from date assigned unless extensions ara requested by the assigned investigator or commander. 6. The pending file shall be checked daily. If an investigation is not completed on the date due, a memorandum shall be directed to the commander who originally received the investigative assignment. An additional two-day extension shall be automatically granted. II. ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS A. lAD shall be responsible for maintaining a master control file of all service/personnel complaints. B. The following Control Cards shall be prepared and maintained by lAD: 1. A 3 x 5 card shall be made for each complainant. The card shall contain the following information: a. Name of complainant-log number. Anonymous complainants shall be so listed. Fig. 6.1-continued Introduction b. Complainant's address and telephone number. c. Brief description of nature of complaint (excess use of force, discourteous, etc.) d. Date and time occurred Date and time reported Date and time received by lAD. e. Other officer{s) involved (if more than one officer is the subject of the complaint) f. The finding shall be entered when the investigation has been completed. 2. A 3 x 5 alpha card shall be made for each officer against whom a complaint is made. The card shall contain the following informa\u00ad tion: a. Name of officer-log number. b. Organizational entity to which officer is assigned. c. Brief description of circumstances (including other officers in\u00ad volved in the complaint). d. Date and time occurred Date and time reported Date and time received by lAD. e. Complainant's name. f. The findings and disposition shall be entered when the case is completed. C. A case folder shall be prepared by lAD. Each case folder shall be marked with the log number and shall be filed sequentially. The case folder shall contain a copy of the original report submitted to lAD and every subsequent document relating to the case. The case folder shall be maintained in a locked file. D. Each citizen making a complaint shall be notified by letter acknowl\u00ad edging receipt of the complaint. This will include an approximate time of complel ion. I n cases where completion of investigation is delayed, an additional letter will be sent to the complainant with the assurance that the investigation is continuing. These letters shall be over the Chief's signature and copies of the same will be maintained in the lAD Case Folder. E. A letter shall be forwarded to the office of the attorney (city, county, or state), over the signature of the Chief, informing the attorney of the receipt of any serious complaint or complaint which may result in legal action against the (officer, department, etc.). The letter shall set forth the date, the nature of the complaint and the names of police personnel against whom the complaint is made. A copy of this letter shall be for\u00ad warded to the Department legal advisor. Fig. 6.1-continued 129 130 .---.------~-~- ~-------_.------- DESIGNING RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR DISCIPLINE F. Upon disposition of a complaint against an officer, the com.plainant shall be notified by letter from the Chief whether the officer was exonerated or the complaint sustained. Similarly if the complaint is against Departmental procedures or policy, the citizen shall be informed by letter of the Departmen+'s position on issues of policy or procedure. If the citizen's complaint against Departmental policy or procedure has merit, the citizen shall be so informed. Fig. 6.1-continued Commentary. This section makes it a disciplinary offense for an officer to violate any rule of the department. Thus, by inclusion of this section, the depart\u00ad ment avoids the cumbersome process of specifying in every rule that \"violation of the rule subjects the violator to disciplinary action.\"} It is necessary to be specific when drafting charges; thus, it would not be sufficient to c.harge an officer with a violation of \u00a7 1.01 alone. The particular offense commItted and the specific rule violated must always be specified. See Chapter Three for a dis\u00ad cussion of drafting charges. \u00a7 1.02 Unbecoming Conduct Officers shall conduct themselves at all times, both on and off duty, in such a manner as to reflect most favorably on the Department. Conduct unbe\u00ad coming all officer shall include that which brings the Department into disrepute or reflects discredit upon the officer as a member of the Department, or that which impairs the operation or efficiency of the Department or officer. Commentary. For reasons discussed in detail in Chapter Three, rules on \"cond uct unbecoming an officer\" are extremely controversial today. In some cases courts have struck them down as being unconstitutionally vague and, in othe; cases, such rules have been upheld. This rule must be distinguished from \u00a7 1.01 which relates to violations of any other defined rules of the department. 1 This section is to be used for violations of any department rules, regulations, direc\u00ad tives, orders or policies which are not included in the prototype rules of cond uct. Prototype Rilles of Conduct 131 The basic purpose of an \"unbecoming conduct\" rule is to serve as a catch\u00ad all, prohibiting acts which are not otherwise proscribed. Because departments cannot possibly define in advance all the acts which are inappropriate for a police officer, it is essential to have such a general rule. Departments should have specific rules to cover foreseeable misconduct. In each instance, before charging an officer with \"unbecoming conduct,\" a department should examine all other rules to ascertain whether a specific rule violation is applicable. If a particular rule applies, it should be used instead of \"unbecoming conduct.\" See Appendix B for cases dealing with specific types of unbecoming conduct. \u00a7 1.03 Immoral Conduct Officers shall maintain a le}Jel of moral conduct in their personal and busi\u00ad ness affairs which is in keeping with the highest standards of the law enforce\u00ad ment profession. Officers shall not participate in any incident involving moral turpitude which impairs their ability to pelform as law enforcement officers or causes the Department to be brought into disrepute. CommentaJY. This section is subject to many of the same challenges as \"unbecoming conduct\"-vagueness and a variety of interpretations. It is difficult to define with any exactIiess what is immoral conduct. An acceptable standard must be established against which to judge the morality of the conduct. Section 1.03 includes a number of standards which should be specific enough to give the rule real meaning. First, there is the \"highest standard of the law enforcement profession.\" This phrase may have meaning through the officer's oath of office, the Law Enforcement Code of Ethics, or his or her status as an officer of the court or a public official. Second, the concept of \"moral turpitude\" is well established in the law and has a fairly precise meaning. Third, impairment of ability to perform as a law enforcement officer refers to the individual's loss of respect among the community or other officers to the point that the notorious nature of the individual's personal character overshadows the authority of his or her office so that he or she can no longer effectively exercise that authority. Fourth, causing the department to be brought into disrepute refers to the same situation as the third factor above, with the exception or addition that the individ ual's conduct reflects adversely on the departmant as a whole, where, for example, the individual's conduct is generalized by the community to involve the entire department, and thus interferes with every officer's effectiveness. It is important to note that when a department charges an officer with conduct which interferes with the effectiveness or the reputation of the officer or the department, it is necessary to prove, as one of the elements of the offense, ., i\u00b7 ----------'n-, ~~ 132 DESIGNING RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR DISCIPLINE that damage has, in fact, been done to the effectiveness or reputation of the department or the officer. \u00a7 1.04 Conformance to Laws A. Officers shall obey all laws of the United States and of any state and local jurisdiction in which the officers are present. B. A cOllviction of the violation of any law shall be prima facie evidence of a violation of this section. Commentary. This section also is a general provision. Subsection A is intended to establish clearly that violation of any law is a departmental disci\u00ad plinary offense as well as an illegal act subjecting the violator to criminal penalties. It is not necessary, under this section, to establish that the illegal act in any way affects departmental operation or that the officer has been convicted of the crime. However, the rule must be applied with caution, especially where the criminal act is minor. Subsection B applies to an officer who has been convicted of a crime. SinCe: proof beyond a reasonable doubt has been established, disciplinary action against the officer is appropriate. \u00a7 1.05 Reporting for Duty Officers shall report for duty at the time and place required by assignment or orders and shall be physically and mentally fit to pelform their duties. Tltey shall be properly equipped and cognizant of information required for the proper pelformance of duty so that they may immediately assume their duties. Judicial subpoenas shall constitute an order to report for duty under this Section. CommelltaJY. Because many police operations function on a shift basis around the clock, it is important that officers going on duty be prompt and pre\u00ad pared to assume their duties as soon as the earlier shift is relieved. Also, while there are judicial penalties for ignoring a subpoena, this section provides for administrative action if an officer fails to respond to a subpoena. \u00a7 1.06 Neglect of Duty Officers shall not read, play games, watch television 01' movies or otl1elwise engage in entertainment While on duty, except as may be required in the per-I, I I I,] t , i ! I j ; Prototype Rules of Conduct 133 formance of duty. They shall ~20t engage in any activities or personal business which would cause them to neglect or be inattentive to duty. Commentary. This rule is more narrowly drafted than most departmental neglect of duty rules. It covers conducting personal business or attending to personal pleasures which might distract officers from their responsibilities or hamper them from responding to calls for service. \u00a7 1.07 Ficticious Illness or Injury Reports Officers shall not feign illness or injury, falsely report themselves ill or injured, or otherwise deceive or attempt to deceive any official of the Depart\u00ad ment as to the condition of their health. Commentary. This section is aimed at preventing misuse of sick leave. While most departments have procedures for reporting illness, with medical certification required in some instances, this section adds administrative penal\u00ad ties to the false reporting of illness or injury. The section is also aimed at pre\u00ad venting false claims of injury for purposes of workman's compensation or disability retirement. Of course, care must be exercised in distinguishing between an outright false report or claim, and one involving an honest difference of medical opinion. \u00a7 1.08 Sleeping on Duty Officers shall remain awake While on duty. Ifl/nable to do so, they shall so report to their superior officer, who shall determine the proper course of action. Commentary. Sleeping on duty is a serious problem for some police officers. Irregular hours, emergency situations, and long periods of relative inactivity, take their toll on the human body. However, sleeping on the job is not only dangerous, it is a waste of the taxpayers' money and harmful to the reputation of the department when a sleeping officer is discovered by a citizen. If an officer is not able to stay awake on the job, the supervisor should take appropriate action such as relief from duty, reassignment or disciplinary measures. \u00a7 1.09 Leaving Duty Post Officers shall not leave their assigned duty posts during a tour of duty except wizen authorized by proper authority. , t i t I j, I, I , 1 . ! I' f 1 f 1 f \\, , ! 1 ! j,:,' : t. :. \" ~ .. ~ ~-~. ==~~-~~~\"\"2&\" .. j\"i\"\"\"\"\"------------------~ni. -------------------------------- 134 DESIGNING RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR DISCIPLINE Commelltary. An officer's failure to remain on his or her assigned post can have serious repercussions which endanger the safety of other officers and the public. There may, however, be occasions when an officer's du ties will f;!quire him or her to leave hi3 or her post. Those occasions which can be antici\u00ad pated should be described in a separate general order on this subject. \u00a7l.lO Meals Officers shall be permitted to suspend patrol or other assigned activity, subject to immediate call at all times, for the pwpose of having meals during their tours of duty, but only for such period of time, and at such time and place, as established by departmental procedures, Commentary. Most departments place fairly rigid restrictions on when and where an officer may take his or her meals while on duty. This section serves to enforce those rules. The restrictions themselves are often necessary to aSSUre that not all officers on the shift are eating at the same time, and that they do not go too far from their assigned post for a meal. \u00a7 1.11 Unsatisfactory Performance Officers shall maintain sufficient competency to properly pel/orm their duties and assume the responsibilities of their positions. Officers shall pel/arm their duties in a manner which will maintain the highest standards of efficiency in carrying out the functions and objectives of the Department. Unsatisfact01Y performance may be demonstrated by a lack of knowledge of the application of laws required to be enforced; an unWillingness or inability to perform assigned tasks; the failure to conform to work stalldards established for the officer's rank, grade, or position: the failure to take appropriate action on the occasion of a crime, disorder, or other condition deserving police attention,' or absence with\u00ad out leave. In addition to other indicia of unsatisfactory performance, the follow\u00ad ing will be considered prima facie evidence of unsatisfact01Y performance: repeated poor evaluations or a written record of repeated infractions of rules, regulations, directiJles or orders of tlze Department. Commentary. This rule covers unsatisfactory performance and includes several methods of establitshing unsatisfactory perfonnance or incompetency. Most of the occasions for use of this rule will arise from an officer's failure to perform as required. Failure to perform, or inaction, is usually more difficult to prove than a specific act of misconduct. If specific acts amounting to neglect of ; : ) . Prototype Rules of COllduct 135 duty are present, \u00a7 1.06 should be charged. If a pattern of poor evaluations or rule violations is present, this rule applies. Other instances covered by this sec\u00ad tion are spelled out. The standards set by the departmen t for job perfonnal'lce may be used for comparison with a particular officer's knowledge, abilities, or actions. \u00a7 1.12 Employment Outside of Department A. Officers may engage in of/duty employment subject to the following limitations: (1) sllch employment shall not illtel/ere with the officers' employ\u00ad ment witll tile Department; (2) officers shall submit a written request for offduty employment to tlle Chief, whose approval must be granted prior to engaging in sucl/ employment; and (3) officers shall /lot engage in any employ\u00ad ment or business involving the sale or distribution of alcoholic be)lerages, bail bond agencies, or investigatiJle work for insurance agencies, private guard ser\u00ad vices, collection agencies or attorneys. B. Approval may be denied where it appears that the outside employ\u00ad mellt might' (1) render the officers unavailable during an emergency, (2) physically or mentally exltaust the officers to tlte point that their pe,formance may be affected, (3) require that any special consideration be given to schedul\u00ad ing of the officers' regular duty hours, or (4) bring the Department illto dis\u00ad repute 01' impair the operation or efficiency of the Department or office,: CommentaJY. Departments have taken a variety of positions on this type of rule. The alternatives range from a total ban on outside employment, to per\u00ad mitting limited kinds of jobs, to allowing most types of employment, to no rule on outside employment. Although courts l1ave upheld a complete ban on second jobs, there is usually unequal enforcement of the rule because some kinds of outside income are not covered. For example, the officer may OWn a farm, the officer's family may operate a store, or the officer may build cabinets to sell or trade. Officers who responded to the lACP questionnaire strongly favored being allowed to have a second job. It is difficult to argue effectively that an officer should be prohibited from working at another job when other activities, such as hobbies or schooling, can be as disruptive to the officer's work performance as a second job. The best solution seems to be a compromise policy, permitting certain types of employment, under certain conditions, such that there will be no conflict of interest nor interference with the primary duty to the police department. This section seeks to implement such a policy. The particular types of employment which are prohil:>ited should be carefully evaluated by the department. Local modifications may be necessary. 136 DESIGNING RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR DISCIPLINE \u00a7 1.13 Alcoholic Beverages and Drugs in Police Installations Officers shall flat store or bring into any police facility or velzicle alcoholic beJlerages, controlled substances, narcotics or hallucinogens except alcoholic beverages, COil trolled substances, narcotics or hallucinogens which are held as evidellce. CommelltGlY. Police officers should not have drugs in police facilities un\u00ad less the drugs are being held as evidence. Also, in order to avoid the appearance of impropriety or temptation, police facilities should not be used for personal liquor. \u00a71.14 Possession alld Use of Drugs Officers shall not possess or liSe any colltrolled substances, narcotics, OJ' hallucinogens except wilen pl'escl'ibed ill the treatme/lt of officers by a physician or delltist. Wlzell controlled substances, narcotics, or hallucinogens are pre\u00ad scribed, officers s/zallllotify t!zeir superior officer. Commentary. Since nonprescription possession or use of controlled sub\u00ad stances is in most cases a criminal act, this section does not add to the rules of conduct any prohibition not applicable to the general public or applicable to the officer through \u00a7 1.04. However, this section is specific to drugs, and it requires the officer to notify the department of any authorized medical use of such sub\u00b7 stances. This notification alerts the department to possible physical or mental effects of drug use and gives the department an opportunity to take appropriate action. \u00a7 1.15 Use of Alcohol on Duty or ill Uniform A. Officers slzallllot consume intoxicating beverages while ill ulliform or all duty except i/1 the performance of duty alld while acting under proper alld specific orders fi'O/11 a sllperior officer. B. Officers shall /lot appear for dllty, or be 011 duty, while under fILe inf7uence of intoxicallts to allY degree whatsoever, 01' witl! al1 odor of ii/toxi\u00ad cants Oil their breath. Commelltmy. This section prohibits officers from drinking alcohol while on duty or in uniform except when under orders to do so. Some departments may choose to modify this rule to permit officers to drink on duty in certain limited situations, such as when in plain clothes and at some social or business if , I \\ \\ Prototype Rules of Conduct 137 functions. The rule also applies to off-duty drinking which impacts in certain ways upon the officer's duty time. \u00a7 1.16 Use of Alcohol Off Duty Officers, while off duty, shall refrain from consuming intoxicating beverages to .:'e extent that it results in impainnent, intoxication, or obnoxious or offensive behavior which discredits them or the Department, or renders the officers llIlfit to report for their next regular tour of duty. Commentary. This section prohibits off-duty drinking which results in dis\u00ad crediting officers or the department or which causes officers to be unfit for scheduled aSSignments. Officers, who were interviewed by IACP staff, frequently stated that off-duty drinking, as other off-duty behavior, was their own private business and should not be interfered with by the department. This rule is drafted to be a reasonable approach to the officers' contentions, as well as a pro\u00ad tection to the department's legitimate interests. \u00a71.17 Use of Tobacco Officers, wilen ill uniform, //lay use tobacco as long as (1) they are IlOt in a formation, (2) tlley do !/Ot llape to leave their assignment or post for tlle sale purpose of doing so, and (3) they are not engaged ill traffic direction and con\u00ad trol. When they are ill direct contact witll tile public, officers must obtain per\u00ad missioll to llse tobacco from tile public with wlzom they are ill direct contact. Commentary. Use of tobacco by officers in uniform is primarily a ques\u00ad tion of \"public image.\" Obviously, an officer should not smoke during a formal ceremony, when in formation, nor when the officer has to leave all assignment to do so. When in direct contact with the public, the officer should be aware that, to some people, smoking is offensive. For a variety of reasons, a citizen who is offended, even slightly, by a public employee, such as a police officer, may complain about the matter more strongly and publicly than if the offending party were in the private sector. \u00a7 1.18 Insubordination Officers shall promptly obey any lawful orders of a superior officer. This will include orders relayed from a supellor officer by all officer of the same or lesser rank. o !) .. I i I _,ilMXUlCiKk Z\u00a3 .5. 138 DESIGNING RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR DISCIPLINE Commentary. Failure to obey a lawful order is a clear case of misconduct. The only question which nwy arise is whether the order is lawful or is in conflict with another order. This situation is addressed in \u00a71.19. \u00a7 1.19 Conflicting or megal Orders A. Officers who are given an otlzenvise proper order which is in conflict with a previous order, nile, regulation or directive shall respectfully inform the superior officer issuing the order of the conflict. If the superior officer issuing the order does not alter or retract the conflicting order, the order shall stand. Under these circumstances, the responsibility for the conflict shall be upon the superior officer. Officers shali obey the conflicting order and shall not be held responsible for disobedience of the order, rule, regulation or directive previously issued. B. Officers shall not obey any order which they know or should know would require them to commit any illegal act. Ifin doubt as to the legality of an order, officers shall request the issuing officer to clarify the order or to confer with higher authority. Commentary. This section provides procedures for an officer to follow if the officer is given an order which conflicts with other orders or is issued an order which the officer considers to be illegal. If an officer receives conflicting orders, the officer must notify the superior officer so that the conflict may be resolved. Failure to do so may render the officer liable for disobedience of both the order and this section. An officer who receives an order which he or she reasonably believes would require him or her to commit an illegal act must at least question that order, and refuse to obey it if not satisfied as to its legality. An officer may not be disciplined for questioning the legality of an order. \u00a7 1.20 Gifts, Gratuities, Bribes or Rewards Officers shall not solicit or aCI..<.:pt from any perSOll, business, or organiza\u00ad tion any gift (including money, tangible or intangible personal property, food, beverage, loan, promise, sel'Jlice, or entertainment) for the benefit of the officers or the Department, if it may reasonably be inferred that the person, business, or organization: 1. seeks to influence action of an official nature or seeks to affect the per\u00ad fonnance or nonperfonnance of an official duty, or Prototype Rules of Conduct 139 2. has an interest which may be substantially affected directly or indirect\u00ad ly by the performance or nonperformance of an official duty. Commentary. There is a heightened awareness among most public officials of the controversy surrounding gifts, gratuities, bribes, and awards. Some offi\u00ad cials construe gifts and gratuities as personal courtesies, and dismiss any connec\u00ad tion with official position, while most officers are able to distinguish between those gifts which are personal in nature from those which bear some relation to official responsibilities. Also, a public official's own interpretation of the situa\u00ad tion may be inaccurate or not acceptable to the pUblic. The language of this section draws heavily from the New York City Board of Ethics Opinion No. 210, issued in the wake of the Knapp Commission hear\u00ad ings. See Figure 6.2 for a complete general order on the subject of gifts and bribes, which establishes guidelines construing the rule. The order reflects the view that absolute prohibitions of gratuities are unenforceable, and that adminis\u00ad trators should therefore draw up standards permitting the acceptance of minor gratuities, under certain conditions. An opposing viewpoint prevalent among police administrators is that all gratuities, no matter how minor, should be banned because of their corrupting influence. Often the discussion of gratuities focuses en whether an officer should be allowed to accept a free cup of coffee.2 The general order illustrates a practical approach to this issue. It allows an officer to accept a free cup of coffee only if he or she has offered to pay for it and the payment has been refused. \u00a7 1.21 Abuse of Position A. Use of Official Position or Identification. Officers shall not use their official position, official identification cards or badges: (1) for personal or finan\u00ad cial gain, (2) for obtaining privileges not othelwise aJlailable to them except in the pelionnance of duty, or (3) for avoiding consequences of illegal acts. Officers shall not lend to another persoll their identification cards or badges or permit them to be photographed or reproduced without the approval of the Chief. B. Use of Name, Photograph or Title. Officers shallilot authorize the use of their names, photographs, or official titles which identify them as officers, in connection with testimonials or advertisements of allY commodity or com\u00ad mercial enterplise, without the approval of the Chief. 2See Herman Goldstein,Police Corruption, pp. 28-29, 1975. 140 DESIGNING RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR DISCIPLINE Commentary. This section prohibits an officer from loaning or abusing identification cards or badges, as well as commercial exploitation of official position. DEPARTMF.NTAL GENERAL ORDER ___________ _ POLICE DEPARTMENT DATE Index as: Gifts and Gratuities GIFTS AND GRATUITIES PURPOSE: The purpose of this order is to establish fair and reasonable guide\u00ad lines construing Rule 1.20 of the Rules on Conduct. Seeking or Accepting Gifts, Gratuities, Bribes or Rewards by employees of the Police Department. I. DEPARTMENTAL POLICY This Department construes Rule 1.20 of the Rules on Conduct to mean that officers shall not place themselves in a position where the officers' private interests may appear to or may actually conflict with their official duties or by reason of which the officers' loyalty, objectivity or judgment may be impaired. The appearance which officers project, as well as their actions, are deemed by the Department to be important elements in determining whether or not there is compliance with or a violation of Rule 1.20. Certain conduct which might seem to violate Rule 1.20, if it were to be liberallY construed, does not appear to the Department to raise any genuine question concerning conflicts of interest. This order sets forth guidelines for compliance with Rule 1.20. II. PERMISSIBLE ACTIONS A. An officer may accept an individual serving of a non-alcoholic beverage offered for free or at a reduced price if the officer has offered full pay\u00ad ment for it and such payment has been refused. B. An officer may accept unsolicited advertising or give-away material such as pens, pads, calendars, diaries or similar items of little or nominal value. Fig. 6.2 General order regarding gifts and gratuities Prototype Rules o/Conduct III.PROHIBITED ACTIONS Except as provided in \u00a7 II of this order, officers shall not accept any: A. Food B. Beverage C. Goods D. Services for free or at a reduced price, if it may reasonably be inferred to be con\u00ad nected with the officer's official position. IV.REPORT AND DISPOSITION OF UNSOLICITED GIFTS A. Report 1. Any officer receiving an unsolicited gift, which may reasonably be inferred to be connected to the officer's official position, shall immediately report the receipt of such gift to the Chief who shall determine its disposition. 2. During the officer's next tour of duty, the officer shall file a written report with the Chief. B. Disposition The Chief shall dispose of the gift in an appropriate manner and shall notify the original recipient of its disposition. Fig. 6.2-continued \u00a7 1.22 Endorsements and Referrals 141 Officers shall not recommend or suggest in any manner, except in the transaction of personal business, the employment or procurement of a particular product, professional service, or commercial service (such as an attorney, ambu\u00ad lance service, towing sel1lice, bondsman, mortician, etc.). In the case of ambu\u00ad la.'lce or towing service, wizen sllch service is necessaJY and the person needing the sel'vice is unable or unwilling to prOCllre it 01' requests assistance, officers shall proceed in accordance with established departmental procedures. Commentary. In orier to avoid any possibility of the appearance of con\u00ad flict of interest or \"kickback\" arrangements, officers must be prohibited from recommending particular products or services related to the performance of their duties. Usually, this section will apply to an officer's dealings with persons out\u00ad side the department. Although general information may be provided, there must -( ~~~ __ ,_p, _____ ~~~=====\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\",, _______ -'KJIUII~ ___ 142 DESIGNING RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR DISCIPLINE be no appearance that the officer or the department has taken any part in select\u00ad ing the product or service, except as stated. \u00a7 1.23 Identification Officers shall carry their badges and identification cards on their persons at all times, except when impractical or dangerous to their safety or to all inves\u00ad tigation. They shall fumish their name and badge number to any person request\u00ad ing that information, when they are on duty or while holding themselves out as having an official capacity, except when the withholding of such information is necessary for the perfonnance of police duties or is authorized by proper authority. Commentary. Officers should be required to carry their identification at all times, on or off duty. If it becomes necessary for the officer to take police action while off duty, the offic.er must be able to identify himself or herself. The only exceptions to this requirement apply to officers in covert operations where revelation of the officer's identity might be dangerous, and situations where the officer is at home or outside his or her jurisdiction, or has no practical way to carry his or her identification. \u00a7 1.24 Citizen Complaints Officers shall courteously and promptly record in writing any complaint made by a citizen against any officer or the Department. Officers may attempt to resolve the complaint, but shall never attempt to dissuade any citizen from lodging a complaint against any officer or the Department. Officers shall follow established departmental procedures for processing complaints. Commentary. It is the responsibility of every officer to record complaints from citizens regarding police service or performance. An officer may attempt to explain an incident or a department policy to a citizen. Any officer receiving a citizen's complaint shall record the complaint on the appropriate forms and forward them to the appropriate persons. \u00a7 1.25 Courtesy Officers shall be courteous to the public. Officers shall be tactful in the performance of their duties, shall control their tempers, and exercise the utmost patience and discretion, and shall not engage in argumentatiJle discussions eJlen in the face of extreme proJlocation. In the performance of their duties, officers Prototype Rules of Conduct 143 shall not use coarse, Jliolent, profane or insolent language or gestures, and shall not express any prejudice concerning race, religion, politics, national origin, lifestyle or similar personal characteristics. Commentary. More citizen complaints result from police discourtesy than from almost any other cause. Discourtesy may include overt rudeness, annoy\u00ad ance, abusive or insulting language, racial or ethnic slurs, overbearing attitude, sexual or social references, disrespect, or a lack of proper attention or concern. In the performance of their duties, officers must maintain a neutral and detached attitude, without indicating disinterest or that a matter is petty or insignifican t. \u00a7 1.26 Requests for Assistance When any persoll applies for assistance or adJlice, or makes complaints or reports, either by telephone or in person, all pertinent illformation will be ob\u00ad tained in all official and courteous manner and will be properly and judiciously acted upon consistent with established departmental procedures. Commentary. Like discourtesy, inattention, delay in response or failure to respond to requests for assistance are major causes of complaints against a police department. To the party requesting assistance, the matter is of paramount importance and an attitude indicating a lack of concern or a failure to respond efficiently is irritating. If the department knows that a request cannot be handled immediately, the requesting party should be informed of the nature and reason for the delay. It is improper for an officer to intentionally and unreason\u00ad ably fail to respond to or delay response to a can for service. \u00a7 1.27 Associations Officers shall avoid regular or continuous associations or dealings with per\u00ad sons whom they know, or should know, are persons under criminal investigation or indictment, or who haJIe a reputation in the comml{nity or the Department for present i11J10lvement in felonious or criminal behavior, except as necessmy to the pelformance of official duties, or where UllaJIoidable because of other personal relationships of the officers. Commelltary. The underlying policy which this section seeks to implement is that persons of notoriously bad character or reputation must be avoided because of the appearance of impropriety and the danger of contaminating an officer's character or reputation. The rule is drafted so as to take into considera\u00ad tion that persons, who have had notoriously bad characters or reputations, may 144 DESIGNING RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR DISCIPLINE have been rehabilitated; therefore, associations with such persons is no longer prohibited. Some flexibility is allowed in unavoidable personal relationships, such as when the officer's spouse or child are included with the prohibited associati ons. \u00a7 1.28 Visiting Prohibited Establishmen ts Officers shall not knowingly visit, enter or frequent a house of prostitu\u00ad tiOIl, gambling house, or establishment wherein the laws of the United States, the state, or the local jurisdiction are regularly violated except in the pelf orm\u00ad ance of duty or while acting under proper and specific orders from a superior officer. Commentary. Except in the performance of duties, a law enforcement officer should not be in a place where the officer knows illegal activity is taking place. Of course, some leeway must be granted, for if the officer has no reason to know of illegal activity, he or she should not be held strictly accountable. Also, if the illegal activity is occasional or sporadic, or limited to a few persons in a public establishment (such as a bookie working out of a bar) the officer should not always be presumed to have knowledge of the illegalities. On the other hand, if it can be shown that the officer had actual knowledge, or at least should have known, the officer should be held accountable. \u00a71.29 ',Gambling Officers shall not engage or participate in any form of illegal gambling at any time, except in the performance of duty and While acting under proper and specific orders /i'01n a superior officer. Commentary. While not all forms of gambling are illegal, those which are should not be engaged in by police officers any more than should other forms of illegal activity. All illegal activity is prohibited by \u00a7 1.04 of course; this section simply serves to point out the specific policy in regard to gambling. It also serves to clarify that gambling may be authorized when necessary to the performance of the officer's duties; for example, when the officer is operating undercover in a gambling investigation. \u00a7 1.30 Public Statements and Appearances A. Officers shall not publicly criticize or ridicule the Department, its policies, or other officers by speech, writing, or other expression, where such Prototype Rules of Conduct 145 speech, writing, or other expression is defamatory, obscene, unlawful, under\u00ad mines the effectiveness of the Department, intelferes with the maintenance of discipline, or is made with reckless disregard for truth or falsity. B. Officers shall not address public gatherings, appear on radio or tele\u00ad vision, prepare any articles for publication, act as correspondents to a newspaper or a periodical, release or divulge investigative illformation, or any other matters of the Depanment while holding themselves out as representing the Department ill such matters without proper authority. Officers may lecture on \"police\" or other related subjects only with the plio]' approval of the Chief. Commentary. This section recognizes the officer's First Amendment rights to freedom of speech, as well as the need of the Department to operate without unlawful or destructive criticism. A blending of these factors is present in the rule, which as been upheld by a federal district court in the Magri case listed in Appendix B. The second segment of the rule limits officers' statements when officers are holding themselves out as representing the Department. \u00a7 1.31 Personal Appearance A. Officers 0/1 duty shall weal' uniforms or other clothing ill accordance with established departmental procedures. B. Except when acting under proper and specific orders from a superior officer, officers all duty shall maintain a neat, well-groomed appearance and shall style their hair according to the following guidelines. 1. Male Officers (a) Hail' must be clean, neat and combed. Hair shall not be wom lOllger thall the top of the shirt collar at the back of the neck when standing with the head in a normal posture. The bulk or length of the hair shall not intelfere with the normal wearing of all standard head gear. (b) Wigs or hair pieces are permitted if they cOllform to the above standards for natural hair. (c) Sideburns shall be neatly trimmed and rectangular in shape. (d) Officers shall be clean shaven except that they may have mustaches which do not extend below the upper lip line. 2. Female Officers (a) Hair must be clean, neat and combed. Hair shall not be worn longer ! I _ f I I I \" f i 146 DESIGNING RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR DISCIPLINE than the top of the shirt collar at the back of the neck when stand\u00ad ing with the head in a normal posture. The bulk or length of tlze hair shall not interfere with the normal wearing of all standard head gear. (b) Wigs or hairpieces are permitted if they conform to the above standards for natural hair. Commentary. Departments may require their employees to be neat, pre\u00ad sentable, and well-groomed. This extends to keeping the uniform clean and pressed, shoes shined, hair properly cut, and so on. The most frequent problem to arise in this area involves grooming standards. For example, as fashions change in the larger society, police department hairstyle standards often lag behind. Frequent conflicts arise because officers wish to adopt the grooming styles of the larger society of which they are a part; they view their police officer role as only one, limited, aspect of their personal identity, and do not wish to limit their appearance to that applicable to only a single element of their lives. On the other hand, the Department may hlive sound reasons for establishing somewhat restrictive standards, including the desire for uniformity of appearance, con\u00ad siderations of safety and equipment usage, local community standards, and others. The rule as drafted has taken into consideration the departmental need for some uniformity of appearance and the relationships between hairstyle and the job of a police officer. \u00a7 1.3 2 Political Activity A. Officers shall be pennitted to; 1. Register and vote in any election; 2. Express opinions as individuals privately and publicly on political issues and candidates; 3. Attend political conventions, rallies, fund-raising fUllctions and similar political gatherings; 4. Actively engage in any nonpartisan political functions; 5. Sign political petitions as individuals; 6. Make financial contributions to political organizations; 7. Serve as election judges or clerks or in a similar position to perform nonpartisan duties as prescribed by state or local laws; Prototype Rules of Conduct 147 8. Hold membership in a political party and participate in its fUnctions to the extent consistent with the law and consistent with this Section; 9. Otherwise participate fully in public affairs, except as provided by law, to the extent that such endeavors do not impair the neutral and effi\u00ad cient perfonnance of official duties, or create real or apparent conflicts ofinterest. B. Officers are prohibited from: 1. Using their official capacity to influence, interfere with or affect the results of an election; 2. Assuming active roles in the management, organization, or financial actiJlities of partisan political clubs, campaigns, or parties; 3. Se;-ving as officers of partisan political parties or clubs; 4. Becoming candidates for or campaigning for a partisan elective public office; 5. Soliciting )Iotes in support of, or in opposition to, allY partisan candi\u00ad dates; 6. Sel1ling as delegates to a political party convention; 7. Endorsing or opposing a partisan candidate for public office in a political advertisement, broadcast, or campaign literature; 8. Initiating or circulating a partisan nominating petition; 9. Organizing, selling tickets to, or actively participating ill a fund-raising function for a partisan political party or candidate; 10. Addressing political gatherings in support of, or in opposition to a partisan candidate; J 1. Otherwise engaging in prohibited partisan activities on the federal, state, county or municipal level. Commentary. State statutes similar to the federal Hatch Act regUlate political activity by public employees such as police officers. Restrictions on such activity are necessary to avoid favoritism in hiring and promotion of public employees, to prevent the building of political \"machines,\" and to assure impar\u00ad tial administration of the laws. First Amendment protections limit the kinds of restrictions which may be placed on political activity. The United States Supreme Court has upheld the Hatch Act and other similar statutes insofar as ___ DESIGNING RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR DISCIPLINE they limit partisan political activity by public employees or use of a public office to influemce an election. Most other political activity may not be restricted. \"Partisan\" refers to an organized political party. The list of activities permitted and prohibited in this section is substantially similar to rules issued by the United States Civil Service Commission (5 C.F.R. 733) and approved in United Stales Civil Sel1Jice Commission v. National Ass'n. of Letter U.S. 548 (1973); see Appendix B. \u00a7 1.33 Labor Activity A. Officers shall have the right to join labor organizations, but nothing shall compel the Department to recognize or to engage in collective bargaining with allY such labor organizations except as provided by law. B. Officers shall not engage in any strike. \"Strike\" includes the concerted failure to report for duty, willful absence from one's position, unauthorized holi\u00ad days, sicklless unsubstantiated by a physician's statement, the stoppage of work, or the abstillence in wlzole or ill part from the full, faithful and proper perform\u00ad allce of the duties of employment for the purposes of inducing, influencing or coercing a challge ill conditions, compensation, rights, privileges or obligations of employment. C011lmentmy. Public employees have a constitutional right to join labor organizations. Laws prohibiting such actions are void. Persons may not be pun\u00ad ished for exercising a constitutional right. However, while the Constitution allows police officers to join a umon, it does not require the employer to recog\u00ad nize or negotiate with that union. Some states have statutes which do require the public employer to recognize a collective bargaining organization under certai.n conditions. Other states have laws which declare a contract between a publIc employer and a union unenforceable. An \"employee association\" is not sub\u00ad stantively different from a union unless it is a purely social group and does not seek to represent members' interests with an employer. \u00a7 1.34 Payment of Debts Officers slzallnot undertake any fin{[llcial obligations which they know or should know they will be unable to meet, and shall pay all just debts when due. An isolated instance of financial irresponsibility will Ilot be grounds for disci\u00ad pline except in lIIlUS1/{/lly severe cases. However, repeated instances of finallcial difficulty may be cause for disciplinal)' action. Fili/lg for a volll/ltmy bankruptcy petition shall not, by itself, be cause for disciplille. Financial difficulties stem- Ii I, I' j' , ! I' ,J Prototype Rules o/Conduct 149 ming from unforeseen medical expenses or personal disaster shall not be cause for discipline, provided that a good faith effort to settle all accounts is being undertaken. Officers shall not co-sign a note for any superior officer. Commentary. Some administrators question whether a police department should have a regulation regarding payment of debts by officers, while other administrators think that such a rule is essential. The usual reasons given in favor of a rule prohibiting \"bad debts\" are as follows: (1) financial difficulties may lead to corruption and bribe-taking, (2) it is embarrassing to the department to have a \"deadbeat\" as a police officer, (3) financial irresponsibility may be indicative of other personality or character defects which may have a negative impact 01' job performance, and (4) the papciwork necessary to administer a garnishment or wage assignment of an employee's wages is costly and time-consuming for the agency. In the private sector, the latter factor is a major reason behind personnel rules dealing with bad debts. Private employers do not get involved with the employee's creditor at all, unless a court judgment has been obtained. Police departments, on the other hand, often are asked by creditors to step in and pressure the officer to pay his or her bills, even without a garnishment having been obtained. Departments often comply with such requests out of a fear of \"embarrassment.\" There are many reasons why assisting a creditor is inappropriate, the most important of which is that the officer may have valid legal reasons for not paying tht'l debt. The department is in no position to determine the validity of the credi\u00ad tor's claim against the officer, and should not get involved in a nonadjudicated claim of indebtedness. Were the department to take a \"hands-off' policy toward officer financial matters requests by creditors for pressure on the officer might substantially diminish. The Consumer Protection Act of 1972 provides that an employer cannot discharge an employee for a single garnishment. If, however, the administration of garnishments is a serious problem for the department, it may legitimately take disciplinary action against an employee with a history of garnishments. The con\u00ad duct of the officer in such a case may be found to be clearly \"job-related.\" If the department is concerned that, because of financial problems, the officer may be a target for corruption, it should deal with the corruption problem directly or assist the officer in straightening out his or her financial difficulties, or both. \u00a7 1.35 Residence Officers shall reside within the jurisdiction served by the Department. New fj __ ~ ______ ~========-=. =--=TI~=-~======~~ __________________ nDa_~_~I'~j ___ 150 DESIGNING RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR DISCIPLINE officers shall reside within the jurisdiction within olle year of their appointl1lent~ or Officers shall reside within [thirty (30) minutes trm'el time!

New officers shall reside witlzin [thirty (30) minutes] [fifteen (15) lI1ile~j of allY duty station witlzin one year of their appointment. C0111l11enfalY. Some departments are required by law to establish a particu\u00ad lar residency rule for officers. Where there is no such law, the department may elect one of the alternatives proposed by this section, depending largely on the particular local circumstances. In determining whether or not to require resi\u00ad dency within the jurisdiction, the department should consider the availability of housing and other essentials, the need to develop community awareness and rapport with citizens, and officer response time to emergency calls. The latter could be handled by requiring officers to live within certain minutes or miles of any duty station. Another alternative is to require residency in close proximi\u00ad ty to the officer's present duty station. Of course travel time may vary due to road conditions, traffic and weather. \u00a7 1.36 Telephone Officers shall hal't! telephones ill their residences, and shall immediately report any changes of telephone numbers or addresses to tlzeir superior officers and to such other persons as may be appropliate. Com mell {aJY. Police officers may be called to active duty at any time. The police department must have an efficient means of getting in touch with its offi\u00ad cers in emergency situations. Therefore, it is necessary that each officer have a telephone-the most efficient method of communication in such circumstances. The cost of maintaining the telephone in most departments is the responsibility of the officer, just as is the cost of getting a haircut and of travel to the work site. \u00a7 1.37 Dissemination of Information Officers slzall treat tlze official business of the Depar\u00b7tment as confidential. Infonnation regardinK official business shall be disseminated only to those for whom it is intended, in accordance with established departmental procedures. Officers may remove or coPy official records or reports from a police installation I Prototype Rilles a/Conduct 151 only ill accordance witII established departmental procedures. Officers slzallnot diJlulge the identity of persons giJling confidential information except as authorized by proper authority. Commen/ary. Police officers regularly come into possession of information of extreme sensitivity. The confidentiality of this information must be main\u00ad tained. Confidential information must not be used to the officer's personal bene\u00ad tH, nor to damage the reputation of any person, nOr to assist any person in avoiding the consequences of criminal acts. \u00a7 1.38 Intervention A. Officers shallllOt intelfere with cases being IIandled by other officers of the Departmellt or by any other go Jlernm en tal agellcy ullless: 1. Ordered to interJlene by a superior oflicer, or 2. The intel1Jening officer belieJ'es beyond a reasonable doubt that 11 mani\u00ad fest injustice would result from failure to take immediate action. B. Officers shall not ulldertake any bwestigatioll or other official actio II IlOt part of t!zeir regular duties without obtaining permission from their superior officer unless the exigencies of the situatioll require immediate police actioll. Commelltmy. Each police officer in a department draws his or her police authority from the same source-generally the state law. Within the confines of whatever administrative restrictions may be placed upon him or her, each officer's power to make arrests is exactly the same as every other officer's power. For purposes of administrative efficiency, some officers are a',signed primary responsibility for certain kinds of offenses-vice, for examr.'!e, or organized crime. Where such assignment of responsibility has taken place, it would disrupt department operations for officers to involve themselves in \"uses assigned to other units or officers. OccaSionally, two units or officers will find their areas of involvement overlapping and possibly conflicting-as where the vice unit wishes to arrest and bring charges against a person, but the narcotics unit wishes to have the person free to act as an informant. In such cases, it should be mandatory that the deci\u00ad sion be left to a ranking officer with authority over both i.ll1its or officers. \u00a7 1.39 Departmental Reports Officers shall submit all lIecessmy reports on time and in accordance with I /! I: (' I I J~~ ---~~. --------~-~-~---~1~1--\u00b7----------------------------------- i i 152 DESIGNING RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR DISCIPLlNE established departmelltal procedures. Reports submitted by officers shall be truthful and complete, and no officer shall knowingly enter or cause to be entered any inaccurate, false, or improper informatioil. COl1lmellfmy. The integrity of the departmental record system must be maintained. This must include both criminal and administrative records. \u00a7 1,40 Processing Property and Evidence Property or evidence which lias been discovered, gathered o~ received in connection with departmental responsibilities will be processed in accordance with established departmental .'Jrocedures. Officers shall not convert to their own use, manufacture, conceal, falSify, destroy, remove, tamper with 01' with\u00ad hold any property or evidence in connection with an inJlestigation or other police action, except ill accordance with established departmental procedures. CommentGlY. Maintenance of the \"chain of evidence\" is essential to a criminal investigation. Improper handling of evidence may imperil the prosecu\u00ad tion of the offender. Police officers frequently come into possession of quanti\u00ad ties of very valuable property, and the department must be diligent in preventing loss, destruction, or alteration of such property. Systems and procedures for its protection must be established, so that any impropriety is discovered imme\u00ad diately and the persons responsible are identified. Possession of property or evi\u00ad dence outside of the established systf.m or chain should be prima facie evidence of improper conduct. \u00a7 1.41 Abuse of Process Officers shall not make false accllsations of a criminal or traffiC charge. Commel/fa/Y. This section is designed to prevent false charges. Withhold\u00ad ing and manufacturing of evidence are covered by \u00a7 1.40. \u00a71,42 Use of Department Equipment Officers shall utilize Department equipmelH only for its intended pUlpose, in accordance with established departmental procedures, and shall not abuse, damage or lose Department equipment. All Department equipment issued to officers shall be maintained in propel' order. Commentary. Police officers are entrusted with a great deal of very valuable equipment and must exercise the utmost caution in its use and mainte\u00ad nance. Also, especially in the case of vehicles, officers should not be permitted I; I Prototype Rules of Conduct 153 to use departmental equipment for personal business, except where speCifically provided for by the department. If ufficers are allowed to use departmental equipment, including radios or uniforms, in any outside employment, such as private guard services, the potential for conflict of interest and legal liability are great. \u00a7 1,43 Operating Vehicles Officers shall operate official vehicles in a careful and prudent mallner, and shall o&ey all laws alld all departmental orders pertaining to such opera\u00ad tion. Loss or suspension of any driving license shall be reported to the Depart\u00ad men. immediately. COlnmelltalY\u00b7 Police officers, especially patrol officers, spend a lot of time operating motor vehicles, and citizens observe and complain about bad driving by police officers. This undercuts the Department's enforcement of the motor vehicle laws. \u00a7 1 ,44 Carrying Firearms Officers shall carry firearms in accordance With law and established depart\u00ad mental procedures. Commel1tary. The Department should isslle specific general orders relating to carrying firearms on duty and off duty. Examples of when to carry and when not to carry firearms off duty should be cited. \u00a7 1,45 Truthfulness Upon the order of the Chief, the Chief's designee or a superior officer, officers shall tluthfully answer all questions speCIfically directed and narrowly related to the scope of employment and operations of the Department which may be asked of them. Commentary. This section requires an officer to respond truthfully to any questions under certain conditions. The section is not limited to internal investi\u00ad gations. An officer who is the subject of an internal investigation nlay be ordered to answer questions, even though the answers might incriminate the officer. Failure to obey an order to answer all questions may result in discipline of the officer, However, the answers which the officer gives in such a situation may not be introduced against him Or her in a criminal prosecution of the officer. If it is intended that the officer's statements be used in a criminal prosecution, the ',.'.' :J 154 DESIGNING RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR DISCIPLINE officer must be given Miranda warnings. See Chapter Three for a more extensive discussion. \u00a7 1.46 Use of Polygraph, Medical Examinations, Photographs, and Lineups A. Polygraph Examinations. Upon the order of the Chief, officers shall submit to polygraph examinations when the examinations are specifically directed and narrowly related to a particular internal ilwestigation being COIl\u00ad ducted by the Department. Whenever a complaint from a citizen is the basis for the investigation, the matter is noncriminal, and /10 corroborating information has been discovered, officers shall not be required to submit to polygraph examinations unless the citizen also submits to a polygraph examination which is specifically directed and nal7'owly related to the complaint. B. ]v[edical Examinations, Photographs, and Lineups. Upon the order of the Chief or the Chief's designee, officers shall submit to any medical, ballistics, chemical or other tests, photographs, or lineups. All procedures can'ied out unler this suhsection shall be specifically directed and narrowly related to a particular intel7lal investigation being conducted ;;y the Department. Commelltary. A police officer may be compell~d to submit to a polygraph examination for purposes of an internal investigation .. While there usually is ot',ler evidence in addition to the polygraph results to support a disciplinary action, polygraph results may be admissible in an internal hearing for whatever they are worth. When an officer is ordered to submit to a polygraph exam, the questions asked must be directly related to the matter under investigation. An officer should not be ordered to submit to a polygraph exam if he or she is the subject of a criminal investigation. Only if the officer is given Miranda warnings and then consents, should a polygraph be given in a criminal case. Even then, in most jurisdictions, the results are not admissible in court. Frequently a citizen complains of abuse by a police officer, but there are no witnesses or other outside evidence, and the officer denies the offense. In a \"one-on-one\" situation, there may be no more reason to suspect the officer of lying than to suspect the complainant of doing so. In such cases, it may be unfair to require the officer to submit to a polygraph, unless the complainant is also willing to submit. On the other hand, this type of restriction could seriously hamper the effective completion of an investigation if all other investigative efforts are fruitless. In addition, such a restriction may appear tantamount to the undesirable practice of not accepting a citizen's complaint unless he or she appears in person or signs a sworn statement. Just as a criminal suspect may not refuse to give \"nontestimonial\" evi-, , i' Prototype Rules of Conduct 155 dence against himself or herself, an officer in an internal investigation may be re\u00ad quired to give such evidence. The only restriction is that the evidence be related to the particular investigation. See Chapter Three for further information. \u00a7 1.47 Financial Disclosure Upon the order of the Chief or the Chief's designee, officers shall submit financial disclosure statements in accordance with departmental procedures in connection with a complaint in which this information is material to the inves tigatioll. or Officers shall submit financial disclosure statements in accordance witli departmental procedures. These statements are to be maintained by the Clzief and shalll/ot be available for public disclosure. Commentary. Upon appropriate orders, or when an officer is the subject of an internal investigation, the officer may be required to submit personal financial data. In some jurisdictions, local law requires certain public employees to file regular \"financial disclosure\" statements to guard against conflicts of interest. \u00a7 1.4& Treatment of Persons in Custody Officers shall not mistreat persons who are in their custody. Officers shall handle sllch persons in accordance with law and departmental procedures. Commentary. Mistreatment of persons in custody might in some cases fall into the category of misuse of force and could be charged as sllch. However, because of the extreme degree of control over prisoners, there is the possibility of mistreatment other than by use of excessive force. Therefore, a separate sec\u00ad tion is necessary to address this issue. The department should isslle detailed instructions specifying how prisoners are to be handled, taking into considera\u00ad tion such factors as safety, security and personal needs. \u00a7 1.49 Use of Force Officers shall not use more force in any situation than is reasonablv neces\u00ad sm)} under the circumstances. Officers shall use force in accordance ~'ith law and departmental procedures. r;.: \\l. 156 DESIGNING RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR DISCIPLINE Commentary. This section follows the general rule on use of force, i.e., use only that amount of force which is reasonably necessary under the circum\u00ad stances. Departmental procedures should spell out the details for use of force. \u00a7 1.50 Use of Weapons Officers shall not use or handle weapons in a careless or imprudent man\u00ad ner. Officers shall use weapons in accordance with law and departmental procedures. CommentOiY. No weapons should be handled improperly. Departmental procedures should establish the proper methods for use of weapons. \u00a7 1.51 Arrest, Search and Seizure . Officers shall not make any arrest, search or seizure which they know or should know is not in accordance with law and departmental procedures. Comme1ltary. Officers should make only those arrests, searches and seizures which are legal and in accord with departmental procedures. COMMENTARY: DISCIPLINE PROCEDURES Before studying the suggested diSciplinary procedures which follow, it is essential to keep in mind that these procedures represent an \"ideal.\" The proto\u00ad type should not be implemented until a careful analysis has been made of local conditions including laws, collective bargaining agreements, civil service rules, etc. This theme has been stated preViously in the manual and must be reiterated. The prototype disciplinary process which follows is intended to offer ideas. These ideas must be shaped to meet particular departmental needs and resources. If the prototype procedures are overly complex for a department, they must be streamlined. Conversely, if the procedUres are too simplistic or do not meet a particular need, obviously an adjustment must be made. The prototype proce\u00ad dures which follow are intended as a guide to creative thinking. The suggestions must be studied and debated before reaching a conclusion on appropriate pro\u00ad cedures for any particular agency. The prototype discipline procedures establish a fair and efficient system for dealing with complaints against officers and against the department. These procedures are not intended to be used for every violation of departmental rules no matter how minor the violation. Many extremely minor violations can best r Commentary: Discipline Procedures 157 be handled verbally by an officer's first-line supervisor as part of his or her routine counseling and supervision of the officer. It is difficult, however, to determine exactly which violations are ex\u00ad tremely minor. Even violations that are minor in many instances can be aggra\u00ad vated in others. Certainly there is a difference between reporting for duty two minutes late and two hours late, but at what point does the violation become serious enough to warrant formal corrective or disciplinary action: at five minutes, thirty minutes, sixty minutes? Similarly, how many times must an officer repeat the same minor violation, for which he or she has previously been counseled, before formal corrective or disciplinary action is imposed? All too often, these decisions are totally within the discretion of the officer's first-line supervisor. Since major and minor violations and their respective gradations cannot be defined with sufficient precision, it is necessary to use other means to insure that a disciplinary system is used uniformly. It would be patently unfair for one officer to be disciplined for the same misconduct which would be ignored if committed by another officer. In response to these problems, the following guidelines are suggested. All citizen complaints should be recorded on a complaint form. When, however, an officer initiates an allegation of misconduct, the officer should fill out a com\u00ad plaint form if he or she believes that the possible violation of a departmental rule is serious enough to warrant formal corrective or disciplinalY action. If a com\u00ad plaint has not been filed and a supervisor believes that a violation would warrant formal corrective or diSciplinary action only if repeated, the supervisor should counsel or warn the officer and record this fact on a counseling form. These counseling forms should be used to record counseling sessions between a super\u00ad visor and an officer regarding deficiencies and corrections which do not warrant formal corrective or diSciplinary action. They are not disciplinary records. Both the officer and the supervisor should sign the form. These forms will be very important in proving a course of conduct in any later disciplinary proceedings. They will also be useful in performance evaluations. To insure that supervisors are using counseling forms uniformly, the internal affairs division (lAD) and inspections division should review them on a regular basis. The prototype procedures specify a variety of formal corrective or disci\u00ad plinary measures the department may utilize in cases of misconduct. These measures consist of corrective' training, counseling, written reprimand, suspen\u00ad sion, demotion, discharge, or any combination of these actions. Disciplinary records will be kept of each instance in which corrective or disciplinary measures are imposed. 158 DESIGNING RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR DISCIPLINE Many of the features incorporated in the discipline procedures have been discussed in previous chapters and in connection with the Prototype Rules of Conduct. The commentary on the prototype procedures frequently refers to Chapter Three, Discipline Procedures and Processes, particularly in regard to the legal basis for the procedures. The following paragraphs summarize the prototype diScipline procedures. A more detailed discussion is included in the commentary following each section of the procedures. When a complaint is lodged against an officer, a copy of the complaint form is sent directly to lAD (Section One). The officer's immediate supervisor begins a limited, preliminary investigation of the alleged misconduct unless stopped by his or her unit commander or lAD (Section Two). The resu1t~ of this investigation are sent through the chain of command to the officer's unit com\u00ad ~land~r (~ecti~n Three). The unit commander reviews the case, completes the mvestIgatIOn, If necessary, and makes recommendations for the disposition of the case. These recommendations are forwarded through the chain of command to lAD (Section Four). If lAD approves the recommendations, the unit com\u00ad mander implements them. If lAD believes that the recommendations are jnappropriate, the case is referred to the Conduct and Procedures Review Board which reviews it, makes recommendations regarding its disposition, and forwards the recommendations to the unit commander for implementation (Section Five). The unit commander implements tne recommendations by 1) exonerating the officer, 2) ordering corrective action, or 3) issuing charges and recommendations for corrective or disciplinary action on a charging form (Section Six). lAD may aSSllme control of and conduct an internal investigation at any time. At the conclusion of an lAD investigation, lAD forwards its report to either the officer's unit commander or to the Conduct and Procedures Review Board for recommendations regarding the disposition of the case. A case is referred to the latter if it involves a large number of officers or officers from different units (Section Five). The unit commander's recommendations must be reviewed by lAD; the Board's recommendations are sent to the unit commander for implementation (see preceding paragraph). An officer who has been charged may demand a hearing before either the Trial Board or the Conduct and Procedures Review Board. If the officer does not demand a I:earing, the case goes dilectly to the chief (Section Seven). The Trial Board provIdes the officer with a formal due process hearing (Section Eight). The .Cond~ct and Procedures Review Board provides an informal hearing (SectIOn Nme). At the conclusion of a hearing, the hearing board forwards its findings and recommendations for the disposition of the case to the chief. After Prototype Discipline Procedures 159 reviewing the case the chief determines what action the department will take against the officer (Section Ten). Figures 6.3 and 6.4 summarize the prototype diSciplinary process. (The figures are all the following two pages).

Section One describes the process for recording complaints. A complaint may be made by a citizen or by any officer. All complaints, regard\u00ad less of the source, mllst be recorded on a complaint fOfm. Any officer may record a complaint, or may refer it to a superior officer or to TAD fOf recording. An officer may not refer a complaint to a subordinate for recording. Copies of the complaint form are sent directly to lAD instead of going through the chain of command. Each department should establish an efficient means of notifying the immediate supervisor of the officer complained against in the complaint. For example, the officer recording the complaint could be required to send a copy of the complaint form to or otherwise notify the imme\u00ad diate supervisor, particularly if both officers are under the same immediate supervisor. Alternatively, lAD may be responsible for notifying the immediate supervisor. In any case, the complaint form should indicate whether the imme\u00ad diate supervisor of the officer complained against has been notified or is aware of the complaint. All citizen complaints must be recorded even if the complaint is resolved to the citizen's satisfaction. Recording these complaints will help prevent cover\u00ad ups and provide the Investigations Unit with a valuable source of information (see Chapter Three). lAD should check their accuracy and file these complaint fonus. Section Two: Supervisor's Action \u00a72.01 A. Upon becoming aware of a possible violation of Department rules, the immediate superl'isor of the officer complained against shall, as soon as practical, begin a preliminary illI'estigation to determine whether a violation occun\u00b7ed. B. Tile unit commander or lAD may, at any time, order the immediate supervisor of the officer complained against to stop a prelimil101Y inl'estigation. \u00a72.02 The prelimil101Y investigation shall be limited to questioning officers under the immediate supervisor's direct supel1 Jision, questioning wit\u00ad nesses and complail/ants who are immediately aJlailable and gathering evidence which may be lost if not secured immediately. Tile immediate supervisor shall flOt take any investigatiJle action which might jeopardize a simultaneous or sub\u00ad sequent investigation. The preliminary investigation shall be completed within two work days. \u00a72.03 Immediately after following the appropriate procedures ill \u00a72.02, Prototype Disciplille Procedures 163 tile immediate sllperJlisor sllall fonvard, through channels, to the unit com\u00ad mallder 1. a report of the alleged violatiol/ 2. all additiO/lal documellts relating to the investigation, and 3. if the illvestigation has yielded sufficient eJlidellce, recommelldations for (a) charges alld correctiJlc or diSCiplinary action (b) correctil'e action, or (c) exolleration. CommelltOlY. Previous chapters have discussed why first-line supervisors are primarily responsible [or enforcing departmental policies and taking action in the face of violations. In the prototype procedures, the immediate supervisor of an officer against whom a complaint has been filed is responsible for conduct\u00ad ing an immediate, limited investigation, unless ordered not to do so by lAD or by his or her unit commander. The intent of this procedure is to allow lAD to maintain staff control over the investigatory process in the agency. In many instances, particularly those involving min01 violations (e.g., late for duty, sloppy uniform), all the necessary information will be obtained during the preliminary investigation. More complex cases will require further investiga\u00ad tion by the unit commander. At the conclusion of a preliminary investigation, the immediate supervisor must forward the results of his or her imestigation, through channels, to the unit commander. If there is sufficient evidence, the immediate supervisor also for\u00ad wards recommendations for the disposition of the case. Section Three: Intermediate Review \u00a73.01 An intermediate supel1Jisor below the unit commander wllo receives a report and recommendations, if allY, pursuant to \u00a72. 03 ji'om a low.!r ranking stlpel1 Jisor shall review the report and recommendations and either approve or disapprm'e them, stating reasons therefore. Within one work day after receipt of these materials, the report and recommendations, if ally, together with tile intermediate supel1Jisor's comments and all additional docu-164 DESIGNING RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR DISCIPLINE ments relating to the investigation, shall be fO/warded, through channels, to the unit commander. CommenfOlY. Supervisors between the immediate supervisor and the unit commander are required to review the immediate supervisor's report and recom\u00ad mendations and approve or disapprove them, stating their reasons. Intermediate supervisors cannot order further investigation or change the recommendations. They can, however, add their comments before forwarding the case to the unit commander. Section Four: Command Action \u00a74.01 A unit commander receiving a report and recommendations, if any, pursuant to \u00a72.03 or \u00a73.01 shall immediately fonvard, through channels, to lAD one copy of the report, recommendations, if any, and all additional docu\u00ad ments relating to the investigation. \u00a74.02 A. The unit commander shall review the case. If the unit com\u00ad I/wnder believes that further investigation is necessmy, the uHit commander shall, unless directed otherwise by lAD, proceed with a complete investigation. The Llilit commander may at allY time request, through channels, the assistance of lAD in conducting an intemal investigation. B. At the conclusion of the im('~tigation or upon receiving all investigative report from lAD, pursuant to \u00a7J.07, the unit commander shall state that 011 the basis of the evidence a violatioll of a departmental rule has or has I/ot occurred, alld shall: 1. Recommend charges and corrective or disciplinary action for tlte of lice I' complained against in tlIe format set out in \u00a76.01 2. Recommend corrective action for the officer complained against, or 3 .. Recommend exoneration of the of lice I' complained against. \u00a74.03 If lAD iltfomls the unit commander that lAD is assuming responsi\u00ad bility for an investigation pursuant to \u00a75.02, the unit commander shall ceaSe further investigation. If and when lAD provides the unit commander With an i/1)IestigatiJle report, and returns the case to the unit commander, pursuant to \u00a75.07, the unit commander shall proceed pursuant to \u00a74.02(B). \u00a74.04 The ullit commander, through channels, shall immediately forward to lAD allY recommendations made pursuant to \u00a74.02(B), together with a report of the alleged violation and all additional documents relating to the investigation. Protot),pe Discipline Procedures 165 \u00a74.05 Any commander superior to a unit commander who receives a report and recommendations made pursuant to \u00a74.02(B), shall review the report and recommendations and either approve or disapprove them, stating reasons therefore. This commander may return the matter to the unit commander for further investigation, and may add comments and new material to the report and recommendations before forwarding them, through channels, along with all addi- tional d(,lcuments relating to the investigation to lAD. , \u00a74:06 A Llnit commander who receives notification of a superJIisor's action pursuant to \u00a712.01, may order the immediate superJIisor of the officer relieved from duty to proceed pursuant to Section Two. Commentary. When a caS(l reaches the unit commander, he or she can make recommendations, if satisfied that the investigation is complete. If not, the unit commander can complete the investigation. Unit commanders need not con\u00ad duct the investigations themselves, but can delegate thio responsibility to subor\u00ad dinates. If a complaint is relatively minor, it should be the responsibility of the officer's immediate supervisor to investigate it. When the investigation is completed, the unit commander must indicate whether there has been a violation of departmental rules. In addition, he or she must make recommendations for the disposition of the case, The unit com\u00ad mander has three options in this regard. lfthe.unit commander recommends that charges be brought against the officer complained against, he or she a1so must recommend what, if any, corrective or disciplinary action should be imposed. Alternatively, the unit commander may recommend corrective action without recommending that charges be brought against the officer. Written reprimand, suspension, demotion, or discharge can be recommended only along with charges. Finally, the unit commander may recommend that the officer be exonerated. Commanders superior to a unit commander are required to review the reports and recommendations they receive from a unit commander and approve them or disapprove them, stating their reasons. While these commanders may order the unit commander to investigate further, they cannot change the recom\u00b7 mendations. They can, however, add their comments before forwarding the case to lAD. Section Five: Internal Investigations \u00a75.01 lAD shall act on behalf of the Chief in canying out allY internal departmental investigation. lAD shall receive complaints against offic~rs or against the Department as provided in Section One. lAD shall have pnmary : ,) ;} , ~ 'f ~J ~:. 166 DESIGNING RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR DISCIPLINE responsibility for conducting such internal investigatiolls, and for oJlerseeing internal illJIestigations by a unit commander. \u00a75.02 Upon receiJIillg Ilotice of a possible Jliolation or at any time there\u00ad after, fAD sllall determine whether an investigation shall be conducted by fAD. lAD\" may assume control of or supplement:ny lilternal inJlestigation at allY time. fAD shall giJle priority to cases of serious offenses, cases illJIolvilzg multiple officers or officers [rom diflerent units, and other cases wllich would !zaJle difficulty illJIestigating eflectipely. \u00a75.03 A. fAD shall notify a citizen complainant, if ally, tlzat the con:\u00ad plaillt is being investigated, unless to do so might jeopardize the il1J1estigation or unless the citizen's address cannot be ascertained. B. fAD may recolllmend to the Chief that a case be referred to the prosecuting attorney for criminal c/zargp.s. \u00a75.04 Any officcr who is the subject of an internal inJlestigatioll shall be afforded all rights and protections prol'ided by law alld by departmental rules and regulatiolls. \u00a75.05 fAD or the pers(>!l wlzo conducts all internal inJlestigation (here\u00ad after referred to as iilJlestigator) may order any officer to cooperate in sllch all investigation. For the purposes of conducting sllch inpestigation and issuing appropriate orders, tlze illJ1estigator shall be the Chief's designee. In addition to any otller authorized utilize tlze following inJles\u00ad tigative procadures wizen appropriate. 1. An officer may be ordered to appear before tile inJlestigator at a reason\u00ad able time and place to submit to questioning or other illJ:estigatioll. 2. fll an interrogation of all officer, the questions shall be narrowly and directly related to the matter under inJlestigation. If a criminal prosecu\u00ad tion is contemplated against an officer who is to be interrogated by an investigatOl; the officer shall be given tile Miranda warnings and allowed to Izave COUl\u00b7'\". : or other representative present. If 110 crimillal prosecu\u00ad tioll is contt \"~lated, tlze respond to ques\u00ad tions. COllnsel or other representatiJle for the officer may be present at tlze discretion of the illJIestigatOl: 3.

If criminal prosecution is not contemplated, counsel or representat!ve may be present at the discretion of the investigator. 1- Prototype Discipline Procedures 167 4. An officer may at any time be ordered by the Chief to submit to a polygraph examination which is specifically directed and . narrowly related to an internal i!1J1estigatio/l. However, when a complal/lt from a citizen is the basis for tlze illJIestigation, the inji'action is noncriminal, and no corroborating information has been discoJlered, tlze of lice I' shall not be required to submit to a polygraph examination unless the citizen also submits to a polygraph examination which is specifically directed and narrowly related to llze inJlestigation. 5. All oflicer's personal property shall not be subjected to search or seizure without probable cause, and a warrant where required by law. Departmental property may be searched at any time, even if assigned to or used exclusiJlely by a single OJ/iceI'. 6. Departmental communications facilities lIlay be monitored at any time, under conditions permitted by law. Other communications or cOIlPersa\u00ad tions may be monitored at any time, under conditions permitted by law. 7. An investigator investigating a suspected serious 'violatioll of departf~1en\u00ad tal rules may, if neceSSaT)', engage in conduct wlzich might constl:ute entrapment unless criminal prosecutiun against tlze officer complallled against is contemplated. \u00a75.06 Whenever an internal inJlestigation yields evidence of possible criminal misconduct by persons other than officers of the Department, the z\"ilJlestigator shall immediately notify the Chief, who shall take whatever action may be deemed appropriate. . . \u00a75. 0 7 At tlze conclusion of an fAD inJlestigation, the fAD lIlvesngato.r shall in writing documellt all evidence gathered, alld may state that on the baSIS of the evidence, the fAD investigator belieJJes that a violation of a department~l rule has or has not occurred. lAD shall forward its report to eitlzer the Ulllt commander from whom it received tlze case, or to the Conduct and Proc:dur~s ReJliew Board as determined by the following factors: if only one offlcer IS inJlolved or a small number of officers under the command of the same unit commander, the case shall be referred to that commander for action pursuant to \u00a74.02(B); if a large number of officers are inJlolJled, or officers under the command of different unit commanders, the case shall be referred to the Con\u00ad duct and Procedures Review Board for action pursuant to \u00a79.05. \u00a75.08 A. Wizen fAD is notified, pursuant to \u00a74.04 of r~commel~dations made pursuant to \u00a74.02(B), and believes that the recommendatIOns are I/lappro-I ~\" i '; 1 I' f 168 DESIGNING RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR DISCIPLINE priate, lAD shall fmward the matter to the Conduct and Procedures Review Board and request that Board to review the case, pursuant to \u00a79.0S. B. When lAD is notified, pursuant to \u00a74.04 of the unit com\u00ad mander's recommendations, and believes that the recommendations are appro\u00ad priate, lAD, through channels, shall so notify the unit commander who shall implement the recommendations by: 1. issuing charges and recommendations for corrective or disciplinalY action pursuant to \u00a76.01 2. issuing an order for corrective action pursuant to \u00a76.02, or 3. issuing an exoneration pursuant to \u00a76.03. Commentary. lAD is responsible for controlling and maintaining records of all internal investigations.3 While lAD at any time may assume control of or supplement any internal investigations, it must give priority to certain typeF of cases enumerated in \u00a7 5 .02. Consequently, many investigations will be con\u00ad ducted by the unit commander. lAD, however, must have knowledge of these investigations and keep records rdating to them. Since lAD performs a monitoring and c0ntrol function, it never makes recommendations regarding the disposition of a case. At the conclusion of an lAD investigation, lAD sends its report either to the unit commander of the officer complained against or to the Conduct and Procedures Review Board, depending upon the number of officers involved. If the case involves only one officer or a small number of officers under the command of the same unit com\u00ad mander, that unit commander makes recommendations pursuant to \u00a74.02(B). If the case involves a large number of officers or officers under the command of different unit commanders, the Conduct and Procedures Review Board will (1) draft charges and recommendations for corrective or disciplinary action, (2) recommend corrective action, or (3) exonerate the officers. Although lAD does not make recommendations regarding the disposition of a case, it does review all recommendations made by a unit commander. If lAD believes that these recommendations are inappropriate, lAD forwards the case to the Conduct and Procedures Review Board which will (1) draft charges and recommendations for corrective or disciplinary action, (2) :ecommend cor\u00ad rective action, or (3) exonerate the officer. If lAD approves the recommendations of the unit commander, it will notify the unit commander of this fact. The unit commander will then issue a 3 See also Fig. 6.1. Prototype Discipline Procedures 169 charging form, all order for corrective action or an exoneration, pursuant to Section Six. \u00a7 5.05 specifies particular investigative procedures which may be utilized by any person conducting an internal investigation. Thesf! procedures are dis\u00ad cussed in Chapter Three, pp. 64-68. Section Six: Charges and Disposition without Charges \u00a76.01 A. When the unit commander is notified (1) that lAD has approved the recommended charges and corrective or disciplinary action pur\u00ad suant to \u00a7S.08(B); (2) of the charges and recommended corrective or disci\u00ad plinary action drafted by the Conduct and Procedures Review Board pursuant to \u00a79.05; or (3) that the Chief has remanded the case pursuant to \u00a710.02(B), the unit commander shall issue the charges and recommendations for corrective or disciplinalY action to the officer complained against C.'~ .? charging form. The charging form shall include: 1. The particular rule or rules alleged to haJ1e been violated 2. The date or dates upon which and the place or places at which the alleged acts or omissions occurred 3. A statement of the alleged acts or omissions 4. The recommended corrective or disciplinalY action and 5. The charged officer's right to appeal to either the Trial Board or the Conduct and Procedures Review Board pursuant to \u00a7 7.01. B. One copy of the charging form shall be given to the charged officer and one copy shall be forwarded through channels to fAD. \u00a7 6. 02 When the unit commander is notified (1) that fAD has approved the recommended corrective action pursuant to \u00a75.08(B); or (2) that the Condllct and Procedures Review Board has recommended corrective action, but no charges, pursuant to \u00a79.05, the unit commander, in writing, shall issue an order for corrective action and fOJward, through channels, one copy to lAD and one copy to the Chief, \u00a7 6. 03 When the unit commander is notified (1) that fAD has approved the recommend r-' exoneration pursuant to \u00a75.08(B); or (2) that the Conduct and Procedures .t<eview Board has exonerated an officer complained against pursuant to \u00a79.0S, thfJ unit commander, in writing, shall exonerate the officer and forward, through channels, c'ne copy to fAD and one copy to the Chief, 170 DESIGNING RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR DISCIPLINE Commel1fary. There is no question that the chief must be informed of the disposition of all disciplinary cases. However, requiring the chief to review and determine the disposition of every case, no matter how minor or frivolous, would be too burdensome. To alleviate this problem, the prototype procedures establish a system of checks and balances, which insure that cases which terminate without reaching the chief are decided fairly. lAD's review of the unit commander's recommenda\u00ad tions is one such check. The Conduct and Procedures Review Board is another. A case will terminate without reaching the chief, if TAD has approved a llnit commander's recommendations for exoneration or for corrective action but no charges. A case also will terminate prior to reaching the chief, if the Conduct and Procedures Review Board. pursuant to \u00a79.05, exonerates or recommends ccrrective action but no charges. In such cases, the unit commander will issue the appropriate implementing ord~r or exoneration to the officer. The unit com\u00ad mander will then notify the chief of the termination and disposition of the case. If an officer has been charged, the officer's case cannot terminate without tb' approval of the chief. An officer is charged when hb or she is given a charging form. For reasons discussed in Chapter Three, pp. 69-70, the charging form should include the five it~ms listed in \u00a76.01. Section Seven: Officer's Appeal \u00a7 7.01 A. An officer who has been charged, within ten days of receiving the charging form pursuant to \u00a76.01, may demand a hearing before the Trial Board or the Conduct and Procedures Review Board. The charged officer may not demand a hearing before both Boards. The charged officer who has elected a hearing before tlze Conduct and Procedures Review Board will be deemed to have waived the right to a due process Izearing. The charged officer's decision shall be final, with the exception, as provided in \u00a79.06, that the Conduct and Procedures Review Board, under certain conditions, may decline to hear a case alld refer the matter back to the charged officer for a hearing before the Trial Board. B. If tlze Conduct and Procedures Review Board declines to hear a case, pursuant to \u00a79.06, the Board, in writing, shall so notify the charged officer. Witlzin ten days of receiving such notice. the charged officer may demand a hearing before the Trial Board. C. A charged officer who demands a hearing shall make such demand ill writing to his or her unit commander. The unit commander, through channels, shall fa/ward anI! copy of such demand to the Chief. Prototype Discipline Procedures 171 \u00a7 7.02 If the charged officer fails to demand a hearing withill ten days of receiving notice of charges and recommendations for corrective or disciplinary action pursuant to \u00a76.01, or notice pursuant to \u00a7 7.01(B), the unit commander shall forward, through channels, to the Chief, one copy of the charging form and all reports, documents and recommendations pertaining to the case. \u00a7 7.03 If an officer charged under \u00a76.01 demands a hearing as provided in \u00a7 7.01, the unit commander shall, through channels, forward parts 1,2, and 3 of the charging form to either the Trial Board or the Conduct and Procedures ReJliew Board, as determined by tlze officer's request for a hearillg. Recommen\u00ad dations for corrective or disciplinOlY action (part 4 of the charging form) shall not be forwarded to either Board, but shall be forwarded to the Chief along with all reports, documents, and recommendations pertaining to the case to be held by tlze Chief ulltil the Board that hears the case fO/wards additional materials to tlze Chiefpursuallt to \u00a78.05 or \u00a79.10. Commentary. Once an officer has been charged, he or she may demand a hearing or accept the recommended corrective or disciplinary action. The officer mu~t make this choice within ten days of receiving the charging form. Failure to demand a hearing within the ten days constitutes a waiver of the right to a hearing. An officer who has not been charged has no right to a hearing. A charged officer has a right to a hearing before the Trial Board or the Conduct and Procedures Review Board. The officer may not demand a hearing before both Boards. A Trial Board hearing is a due process hearing; a Conduct and Procedures Review Board hl!aring is not. Only the Trial Board can hear com\u00ad plex or serious cases, such as those in which criminal charge3 have been filed against a charged officer. By demanding a hearing before the Conduct and Pro\u00ad cedures Review Board, a charged officer waives his or her right to a due process hearing, unless that Board refuses to hear the case because it is so complex or serious that it should be heard by the Trial Board. In such cases, the charged officer has ten days in which to demand a hearing before the Trial Board. When a charged officer demands a hearing, the Board that will hear the case must be given the following information about the case: the particular rule(s) alleged to have been violated. ~he date(s) on which and place(s) at which the alleged acts or omissions occurred, and a statement of the alleged acts or omissions. To help insure that the Board remains neutral and impartial, the Board is not given the recommendations for corrective or disciplinary action. These recommendations are forwarded to the chief, who will review them after the Board has heard the case and sent its report to the chief. If a charged officer does not demand a hearing, the case goes directly to the chief. , , 172 DESIGNING RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR DISCIPLINE Section Eight: Trial Board \u00a78.01 The Trial Board shall hear cases of violations of niles appealed by a charged officer pursuant to \u00a7 7.01. The Trial Board shall be a formal, administra\u00ad tive hearing; however, the rules of evidence shall not apply. \u00a78.02 The Trial Board shall be appointed by the Chief of Police. A new Board shall be appointed for each case, except that one Board may hear multiple charges against one or more officers if the charges arise out of the same transac\u00ad tion or occurrence. The Board shall consist of three officers, who shall be selected as follows: the Chief shall furnish the charged officer with the names of five officers, one of whom shall be of the same rank as the charged officer. The charged officer shall strike two of these names. One member of the Board shall be designated by the Chief as presiding officer. \u00a78.03 The Trial Board shall provide timely notice to the charged officer of the charges and of the time and place of the hearing, which shall be not more than thirty days from the date of the charged officer's demand for a healing, unless criminal charges are pending against the charged officer, in which case the hearing may be postponed until the conclusion of the criminal trial. The charged officer, prior to tlze healing date, may request and receive one continuance of not more than twenty additional days. The citizen complainant, if any, also shall be notified of the time and place of the hearing, and shall be permitted to attend, unless there is a compelling need for secrecy, as determined by tlze pre\u00ad siding officer of the Trial Board. \u00a78.04 Trial Board proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with due process. The charged officer is entitled to be represented by counsel at the hear\u00ad ing, but counsel shall not be provided by the department. All proceedings shall be recorded. The charged officer shall have the riglzt to present evidence, to call witnesses on his or her behalf, and to cross-examine witnesses against him or her. The burden shall be on the department to prove the violation of the rule by substantial evidence. Witnesses shall testify under oath. The Board may appoint all attorney to nile upon motions and advise the Board. The department may have its case presented by an attorney. The hearing shall be open unless there is a compelling need for secrecy, as determined by the presiding officer of the Trial Board. \u00a78.05 At the conclusion of a hearing, the Trial Board by a majority vote, in writing, shall summarize the evidence, make findings of fact based all substan\u00ad tial evidence and fa/ward such to the Chief, together with recommendations for action pursuant to \u00a7 1 O. 03. ==-n \u00b71 ! ! I 1 r Prototype Discipline Procedures 173 Commentary. The Trial Board provides a charged officer with a formal due process hearing (see Chapter Three, pp. 69-74). Board members are appointed by the chief for each case. The charged officer is given the names of five prospective members, one of whom must be of the same rank as the charged officer. The charged officer must strike any two of these names. Thus the charged officer is given the opportunity to have one of his or her peers sit on the Board. The Trial Board hearing must be open and the citizen complainant per\u00ad mitted to attend, unless the presiding officer of the Board determines that there is a compelling need for secrecy. Such need would be present if confidential or particularly sensitive material is being presented. All action taken by. an adminis\u00ad trative hearing board should be well documented and clearly explall1ed. There\u00ad fore at the conclusion of the hearing, the Trial Board, in writing, summarizes the ~vidence and makes findings of fact and recommendations for the disposi\u00ad tion of the case. This material is then sent to the chief. Section Nine: Conduct and Procedures Review Board \u00a79.01 The Conduct and Procedures Review Board is hereby esta~l~s~led under the direct authority of the Chief.

Commelltary. The Conduct and Procedures Review Board is one of the most innovative parts of the prototype discipline procedures. The Board has two major functions: policy review and conduct review. The conduct review func\u00ad tions are described in \u00a79.0S-\u00a79.1O. The policy review functions would be described in a separate general order. Members of the Board are chosen by the chief and serve at the chiefs pleasure. Virtually all ranl.:s and major functions within the department are represented. There is also additional input from a community representative when the Board considers policy matters. When the Board sits for conduct review functions, neither the community representative nor the legal advisor participate. The community representative is excluded because civilians are often unaware of the complexities and ramifica\u00ad tions of many police policies and actions, due to their lack of police experience. In addition, the prototype procedures establish a totally internal disciplinary system with no form of civilian review. The legal advisor is excluded from conduct review functions in order to maintain the trust and confidence officers must have in their legal advisor. Involving the legal advisor in disciplinary matters 176 DESIGNING RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR DISCIPLINE could make field personnel reluctant to discuss enforcement problems with him or her, especially if their conduct is possibly improper. The Conduct and Procedures Review Board has two conduct review func\u00ad tions. First, in either of two instances, the Board may (1) exonerate an officer, (2) recommend corrective action, or (3) draft charges and make recommenda\u00ad tions for corrective or disciplinary action (\u00a79.0S). The Board can take such action when lAD believes that recommendations made by a unit commander pursuant to \u00a74.02 are inappropriate (\u00a7S.08(A)) or when lAD has conducted an investigation involving a large number of officers or officers from different units (\u00a7S.07). lAD cannot review the Board's actions. The Board's second conduct review function is to hold hearings on charges of violations of departmental rules. As was previously discussed, the Board may decline to hear any case which is so complex or serious that it should be heard by the Trial Board. Once the Board (minus the legal advisor and community representative) decides that it should hear a case, the charged officer must strike two members. The remaining five constitute the hearing panel which will hear the case. Unlike a hearing before a Trial Board, a hearing before a Conduct and Procedures Review Board hearing panel is informal. It is not a due process hear\u00ad ing. The following chart lists the major similarities and differences between the two types of hearings. Trial Board 1. Chief appoints five potential members; one must be the same rank as charged officer. 2. Officer strikes two names. 3. Three members. 4. Due process hearing. S. Open hearing unless compelling need for secrecy. 6. Citizen complainant permitted to attend unless compelling need for secrecy. Conduct and Procedures Review Board Hearing Panel 1. Seven poten tial members from Conduct and Procedures Review Board. 2. Officer strikes two names. 3. Five memt:m:. 4. Informal hearing. 5. Closed hearing. 6. Citizen complainant permitted to attend unless' compelling need for secrecy. f; Prototype DiscipliHe Procedures 7. Officer may be represented by counsel; department may have attorney present its case; Board may appoint attorney to rule on motions and advise Board. 8. Proceedings recorded. 9. Rules of evidence do not apply. 10. Witnesses must testify under oath. 11. Officer has right to present evi\u00ad dence, call witnesses, and cross\u00ad examine witnesses. 12. Substantial evidence required. 13. Department must prove viola\u00ad tion of rule. 14. Summarizes evidence, finds facts, makes recommendations for the disposition of the case. 177 7. No attorneys. 8. Proceedings not recorded. 9. Rules of evidence do not apply. 10. Witnesses may be required to testify under oath. 11. Panel may call witnesses at re\u00ad quest of officer or citizen com\u00ad plainant. 12. Substanthl evidence required. 13. Panel may accept investigative reports as full and fair statement of facts unless officer presents contrary evidence. 14. Summarizes evidence, findE facts, makes recommendations for the disposition of the case. There are several advantages to a hearing before a Conduct and Procedures Review Board hearing panel. The fact that the hearing is informal and that due process does not apply, will tend to create a less adversary atmosphere t~an will be present at a Trial Board hearing. The five members of the panel are lIkely to represent a wider range of departmental experience than the three members of the Trial Board. Panel members are also likely to be more attuned to depart\u00ad mental policies and procedures, due to their policy review functions. In any case an officer will know who the potential panel members are before he or she demands an appeal; he or she will have no way of knowing whom the chief might appoint as potential Trial Board members. . Although an officer is entitled to a due process heaflng, he or she may not want to bother with the formality and expense of one. For example, if an officer wanted to contest only the recommended corrective or disciplinary action and not whether he or she committed a violatiC'n of a departmental rule, , () I; 1 ~ . -\\ ~'\"\"\" \\ \"\" 178 DESIGNING RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR DISCIPLINE it would be advantageous to appeal to the Conduct and Procedures Review Board. A charged officer may demand a hearing before the Board even if the Board drafted the charges against the officer, pursuant to \u00a7 9 .05. At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing panel, like the Trial BOkrd, summarizes the evidence, and makes findings of fact and recommendations for the disposition of th case. This material is then sent to the chief. Section Ten: Chief's Action \u00a710.01 Upon receipt, the Chief shall review all summaries, findings, reports, and recommendations received pursuant to \u00a7 7.02, \u00a7 7.03, \u00a78.05, and \u00a79.10. \u00a7 1 O. 02 A.

In deciding upon a corrective or disciplinOlY action, the Chief may consider the nature and severity of the violation, the officer's personnel record, recommendations of the charged officer's supel1 1isors and commanders, recommendations of the Trial Board or Conduct and Procedures Review Board, and corrective or disciplina/y action imposed in prior cases of a similar nature. \u00a710.04 The Chief, through channels, in wliting, shall notify the charged officer of any action taken pursuant to \u00a710.03(A), (B), or (Cj and of the officer's right, if any, to appeal to a court or other body. \u00a7 1 0.05 The Chief, in writing, shall notify the citizen complainant of the disposition of any case involving the citizen's complaint. Any unit commander il1Jlo/Jled in the termination of a citizen's complaint prior to the case reaching the Chief shall assure that the Chief is notified immediately of the terminatioll so that tht: Chief may notify the citizen complainant of the disposition of the case. \u00a7 10.06 A. The Chief, in writing, shall notify lAD of the specific final action taken by the Department on each complaint. B. If the charged officer appealed pursuant to \u00a77.01, the Chief shall notify the presiding officer of the Board that heard the appeal of the specific final action taken by the Department on the complaint. Commentmy. The disposition of each case in which an officer has been charged is determined by the chief. By the time a case reaches the chief, the chief should have received 111 reports, recommendations, and other matenuls pertinent to the case. After a thorough review the chief decides whether to exonerate the officer or sustain the charges and impose corrective action. Cor\u00ad rective training may be ordered even when the officer is exonerated. As dis\u00ad cussed in Chapter Three, there must be substantial e1ddence supporting the charge, and the \"punishment\" must fit the offense. In deciding upon a corrective or disciplinary action, the chief may con\u00ad sider many factors, including the recommendations of the charged officer's supervisors and commanders and the recommendations of the Trial Board and Conduct and Procedures Review Board. The chief is not, however, bound by these recommendations. Administrative consideration of evidence always creates a gap between the time the record is closed and the time the decision is made. During this time new evidence may be discovered, particularly if the chief has remanded the case for additional investigation. Occasionally, such newly discovered evidence will II p 180 DESIGNING RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR DISCIPLINE be important enough to warrant giving the charged officer the opportunity for a new hearing. The four criteria listed in \u00a7 10.02A.1. are similar to those used by courts in granting new trials because of newly discovered evidence. If newly dis\u00ad covered evidence meets these criteria, the case should be referred for action to the unit commander (pursuant to \u00a74.02) or to the Conduct and Procedures Review Board (pursuant to \u00a79.05), depending upon the number of officers involved. If, as a fflsult, the officer is recharged, he or she has the right to appeal . pursuant to \u00a77.01. When the chief remands a case for further investigation and no new evidence meeting the criteria in \u00a7 10.02A.1. is found, the chief may determine the disposition of the case pursuant to \u00a710.03. The chief may also remand a case to the charged officer's unit commander for recharging if the chief believes that the charge is inappropriate. An officer who is recharged has a right to appeal pursuant to \u00a77.01. Section Eleven: Probationary Officers \u00a71l 01 Except as proJlided in \u00a711.02, a probationary officer may be summarily discharged for just cause by the Chief after written notice of the reasons therefore, but without a hearing. \u00a7 11. 02 After the probationaJY officer has been summarily discharged and if in the judgment of the Chief the conduct giving rise to the summwy dis\u00ad charge falls within either of the following categories, a probationaJY officer shall ha)Je the right to a hearing before the Trial Board as provided in \u00a7 7. 01, hut shall not lzaJle a right to a hean'ng before the Conduct and Procedures Review Board. 1. If the conduct constitutes the exercise of a constitutional right and the Chief summarily discharges the probationer for this conduct, the Department r,lUs! demonstrate at the hearing that the exercise of the constitutional right has resulted in ar impairment of the operation or efficiency of the Department. 2. If the conduct charged will cause the good name, reputation, honor or integrity of the probatiollwy officer to be brought into disrepute and tlze C/itef summarily discharges the probationer for this conduct, a hearing will be held for the purpose of permitting the officer to record for future employment any facts in mitigation of the charged conduct. The Chief may proceed with the discharge regardless of the facts pre\u00ad sented at the hearing. Commentary. Section Eleven covers the procedures that apply to the sum\u00ad mary discharge of probationary officers. Since probationers have no expectation Prototype Discipline Frocedures 181 of job security and in most ca3es no right to a due process hearing they can be sum~a~il~ discharged (see Chapter Three, p. 70). However, no oth~r corrective or d~scI~hnary actions may be summarily imposed. Although the law does not req~Ire It, the prototype procedures provide that a probationer must be given notice of the reason for his or her summary dismissal. Section Twelve: Temporary Relief from Duty, Summary Suspension or Discharge . \u00a712.01 A supervisor may temporarily relieJle from duty an officer under hIs or her superJlision for a period of not more than one work day on the grou~ds that the officer is unfit for duty. \"Unfit for duty\" may include any phYSical or mental condition which might, in the judgment of the supervisor render. the officer incapable of adequately pelf arming duties, or performin; them III such a way as to emban'ass or discredit the Department, or jeopardize the sa~ety of any person or property. The supervisor shall immediately notify the umt commander of the officer relieJled from duty of any action under this section. . \u00a712.02 A supervisor who relieJles an officer from duty under \u00a712.01 may dl~ect that the officer be carried on sick leaJle, Jlacation time, or other appro\u00ad pnate leaJle with pay. A relief from duty under this Section shall not inJloiJle a loss of pay; howeJler, loss of pay for the period of relief from duty for this o.ccurrence ~ay be .imposed in addition to allY subsequent disciplinary suspen\u00ad Sion, demotIOn or discharge based on this occurrence. \u00a712.03 A unit commander, through channels, may recommend to the Chief that an officer, against whom a complaint has been filed or about whom an inJlestigation is pending, be relieJled from duty for a period not to exceed 30 days. Power to issue such a relief from duty shall be Jlested solely in the Chief. If the c~~e canno~ be resolJled within 30 days, the Chief may continue the relief for additIOnal perIOds, not to exceed 10 days each. A relieffrom duty under this Se~tion shall not inJlolJle a loss of pay; howeJler, loss of pay for the period of relzef from duty for this occurrence may be imposed in addition to any suose\u00ad quent diSciplinary suspension, demotion or discharge based on this occurrence. \u00a712.04 If any case in which: 1. an officer engages in a strike as defined in \u00a71.33(B) of the Rules of Conduct, 2. an officer has been indicted for a criminal Jliolalion, or 3. an information or a warrant for the officer's arrest has been issued :1'->;>\"\"------- 182 DESIGNING RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR DISCIPLINE the Chief, in writing, may summarily suspend or discharge the officer from the Department, thereby terminating the officer's salmy. In case of such summary suspension or discharge, the officer shall have the right to demand a hearing before the Trial Board as provided in \u00a7 7.01, but the officer shall not be paid for the period after the summary' suspension or discharge, unless the Chief elects to reinstate the officer with back pay for part or all of the period of the suspension or discharge. Commentary. Under some conditions it may be in the best interest of the department and an officer to relieve the officer from duty for a temporary period. Where the officer is not fit for duty (for example, if the officer is intoxi\u00ad cated, ill, physically tired. sleepy or injured), it would not be wise to allow til\" officer to perform his or her regular duties. Likewise, if the officer has been involved in an emergency situation and is emotionally upset, or if the officer is suspected of some serious misconduct which throws into question his or her character or fitness, the officer should be relieved from duty immediately. This section allows such a relief from duty to be imposed for not more than one day by an immediate supervisor, and for not more than 30 days, with extensions if necessary, by the chief. The longer period might be appropriate where an investi\u00ad gation is taking place, or where an officer has been charged with an offense and a hearing or trial is taking place. The common provision of suspension \"until further notice\" is not pro\u00ad vided here because it is unnecessarily vague. The provision for a thirty-day relief from duty, with ten day extensions assumes that the matter will be periodically brought to the attention of the chief, who may then take steps to eliminate unnecessary delays in the ongoing process. Also, it should be noted that the temporary relief from duty is with pay. Only if a charge of misconduct is upheld and a lo~s of pay imposed as part of a disciplinary action, mayan officer lose pay for the period of the relief from duty. In cases where a criminal charge has been brought against an offIcer, it is not necessary that the department wait until the criminal case is concluded before taking disciplinary action. The officer who has been criminally charged may be summarily suspended or discharged from the department, and thereby removed from the payroll. However, the officer may still demand a full hearing and the department must provide him or her a hearing if he or she so demands. The hearing may be postponed pending the conclusion of the criminal case (see Chapter Three, Suspensions). At the hearing, the department may decide to affirm or rescind the summary suspension or discharge. If the suspension or dis\u00ad charge is rescinded, the officer would be entitled to back pay. r---d Ii I I: ) f, Prototype Disciplille Procedures 183 .

' ',I I) [\\ APPENDIX A Methodology and Statistical Findings INTRODUCTION This appendix presents a description of the methodology selected for analyzing the employee questionnaire together with other accumulated data. The principal thrust in the analysis is a comparison of data from this questionnaire with quali\u00ad tative data collected from the administrative and legal analyses. The appendix includes descriptions of the methodology used for data collection and analysis, and the study domain. Relationships are also explored between key study variables, intuitive propositions, and research questions formulated during the project. Questionnaire data are then presented by type of analysis. All agencies studied via the questionnaire are analyzed as a group and individually. METHODOLOGY Existing conditions were studied in seventeen diverse police agencies through three forms of analysis: an administrative analysis; a two-part legal analysis which included (1) an assessment of internal rules and procedures and (2) interviews with selected government officials and citizen group representa\u00ad tives; and an employee questionnaire designed to ascertain officer perceptions of existing practices.! These data were analyzed for purposes of defining com- ! Sixteen departments participated in the questionnaire assessment of officer opin\u00ad ions. The remaining agency refrained from questionnaire administration. At the time of the IACP field visit, the agency was involved in contract negotiations with its employee organi\u00ad zation and felt that a directive encouraging participation in the survey would possibly strain management-labor relations,. 185 jJ' 186 APPENDIX A mon disciplinary problems of law enforcement and identifying new and innova\u00ad tive techniques for resolving these problems. All results were compared with current legal proscriptions on internal discipline (as well as successful manage\u00ad ment strategies used by the private sector) to prepare a prototype set of rules of conduct and disciplinary procedures capable of adaptation in any law enforce\u00ad ment agency. An objective in the analysis was to compare similar information on like management practices collected through the three field instruments. Through such comparison, it was possible to contrast differing perceptions of several diSciplinary practices. The quality of written directives, for example, was assessed from a management perspectillCl through the administrative analysis and from the employees' viewpoint through the questionnaire. Although this tech\u00ad nique proved successful in many instances, it was not possible to compare all procedures and practices from each of Ih.e three perspectives. Certain subjects, such as the legality of rules or procedures, were not susceptible to employee assessment or to administrative analysis and were analyzed only from the kgal perspective. Such infonnation is not included in this appendix, but is most valuable in that it provides a basis for structuring the prototype rules of conduct and disciplinary procedures.2 This appendix presents conclusions fryr comparable administrative analysis and attitudinal questionnaire data. Thes',' ;\u00b7\u00b7;nclusions are preliminary in the sense that a wealth of information is provtded on a subject which heretofore has not been researched extensively. And perhaps more importantly, the conclusions have policy implications in that several problems in internal discipline are identi\u00ad fied requiring immediate attention. A review of findings would not be complete without some description of the method of (1) questionnaire administration and coding, (2) the administra\u00ad tive analysis data collection plan, and (3) the analytical design. This information is detailed in the following sections. Questionnaire Administration and Coding The questionnaire was administered to a sample of officers in each agency, stratified by rank, seniority, assignment and race.3 This stratification plan was 2Specific baseline data on the legality of rules of conduct and disciplinary procedures are included in Apper,dix B. 3The actual sampling breakdown for each criterion comprised the following: rank (commanders, supervisors, and patrol personnel); seniority (less than one year, more than one year but not greater than three years, more than three years but not greater than five years, more than five years but not greater than twelve years, more than twelve years); assignment (field operations, investigation, and administrative services); and race (Black, Oriental, Mexican-American, Methodology and Statistical Findings 187 chosen to ensure that all samples approximated actual popUlations. Responses were expected to vary according to fach of the sampling criteria. For example, it was felt that officers of different ranks would possess varying levels of under\u00ad standing of departmental disciplinary procedures, and divergent attitudes regarding the quality of disciplinary practices. The same assumption was made concerning seniority. Younger officers with less experience in diSciplinary matters were expected to perceive diSCiplinary actions as more fair than older officers, and would be more apt to understand diSciplinary policies covered in recruit training programs. Similarly, officers assigned to 2!dministrative positions (e.g., planning and research, training, personnel) would more than likely have a greater knowledge of management poliCies than operational personnel assigned to patrol or investigations. And the investigator, because of his or her experi\u00ad ence, was thought to have different perceptions of disciplinary practices than the average patrol officer. Race was also considered an important sampling criterion. Black officers and officers of Mexican-American descent were expected to have different perceptions of discipline than the average white officer. Samples ',vere selected through a quota sampling technique utiliZing these four strata. In most agencies, administrations were conducted at roll call sessions with each respondent's years of service, rank, assignment and race tabulated by IACP personnel while questionnaires were being completed by the officers. 4 If it was found that after several administrations the sample did not approxi\u00ad mate the population in one or more sampling criteria, additional questionnaires were administered to selected individuals, thus meeting desired sample criteria. The value of this approach is that it provided an estimate of the total population value (actual responses for all officers in each agency) without necessitating that stringent prearranged sampling requirements be placed on each agency. If, in contrast, a probability sampling design was used it would have been necessary to \"pre-select\" all participants and then administer the questionnaire. This would have been most difficult considering the practical considerations of the adminis\u00ad tration.s In all cases, appropriate samples were obtained for each sampling criterion. Only in very few instances did sample proportions vary considerably from overall popUlation proportions (the greatest variation for anyone sampling criterion was 31 percent; the average variation for all agencies was 5.25 percent 4In some agencies, practical considerations mandated that offic~rs be called f:om duty in small groups to participate in questionnaire administration. Most often, this tactic was used when insufficient time was available at roll call. or in those instances in which daily ~oll call did not occur (e.g., if the agency deployed personnel in some form of a team polic\u00ad mg program not requiring daily instruction). sThe use of such techniques would have required more extensive travel time by the research staff, and would have placed unworkable demands on each participating agency. ! , 188 APPENDIX A for each sampling criterion). This finding indicates that for all four strata (rank, seniority, assignment, race) sample proportions were quite similar to the actual proportions. On the aver::tge, each element of the strata (e.g., commander, supervisor, officer for the rank strata) varied only 5.25 percent from actual proportions. . . The number of officers sampled in each agency vaned accordmg to the quota sampling design and to the overall size of the departm:nt. A samp~ing plan was developed to account for the size of each agency. ThIS plan speclfed ~h.e minimum number of officers required to ensure an adequate sample. ThIS mInI\u00ad mum number was frequently exceeded to fiU quota requirements. If it were found, for example, that a particular strata did not approximate act~al propo:\u00ad tions, although a minimum number of questionnaires had been obtamed, addi\u00ad tional administmtions were conducted. The questionnaire was completed individually by officers who were given instructions by an IACP staff member. Officers were advised of the anonyn:ity of their responses and told that if they did not wish to complete the question\u00ad naire they did not have to do so. This approach proved successful in that many officer concerns about the use of the data were addressed and minimized. As a result, an overall response rate of .995 was obtained for the sixteen agencies surveyed. Officers who refused to complete the instrument did s~ beca~se they felt they could not give objective responses. Major reasons for thiS feelmg w~re that a pending appeal or major disciplinary case involving the officer would bIas personal attitudes. Questionnaire data were coded through use of a standard code book. All coders were trained and results were verified. In some instances, coders were retrained to rectify misunderstandings and confusi~n. All data were, verified after final coding with an average error rate of two Items per agency ~an error rate of .014 for 2,165 cases). Administrative Analysis Data Collection Plan The administrative analysis instrument was designed to facilitate expedi\u00ad ency in data collection. Instrument items were organized in such manner to permit complete analysis with a minimum number of interviews (up ~o seven administrative personnel were interviewed in each agency). The fo~lowmg st~ff members participated in the interviews: planning and research coordmator, tr~In\u00ad ing director, inspectional unit member, internal affairs staff member, first-Ime supervisor, individual unit commander, and chief of police. The instrument was arranged according to functions, and in those cases where one or more of the Methodology and Statistical Findings 189 above seven functions was not carried out, less than seven interviews were com\u00ad pleted. Also, in some agencies more than one of these functions was performed by the same individual. In such a case, this person was interviewed for all applicable portions of the instrument. For example, in several agencies, respor,Ji\u00ad bility for the internal affairs function and the inspections function was assigned to one organizational unit. In such case, one staff member would be inter\u00ad viewed for portions of the administrative analysis dealing with both functions. Interviews were scheduled prior to visiting each agency and an itinerary developed for all appointments. Generally, interviews followed the instrument format, although in some cases staff members were forced to digress and discuss other problem areas of discipline. This outcome, however, was anticipated and did not in the opinion of staff directly bias results in that pertinent subjects were still researched. Analytical Design The basic intent in the design was to compare data from the questionnaire with selected data from the administrative analysis. The research staff conducted this analysis by structuring attitudinal scales and indices from the questionnaire to reflect officer opinions on specific management practices.6 By comparing these data and other single questionnaire items with administrative analysis results, it was possible to develop a descriptive profile of those management techniques which produce the most positive responses by employees. Through such a technique, it was possible to contrast conditions in those agencies receiv\u00ad ing high scores on particular scales to those which received low ratings. Key factors in the administrative process contributing to such scores were isolated for study through this process. Prior to analyzing these scores, a set of preliminary propositions was devel\u00ad oped to explain differences in departmental scores. These propositions focused on selected concepts In the administrative process that were thought to affect officer perceptions. For example, it was conceived that more positive scores on questions measuring understanding of disciplinary policies would be obtained in those agencies incorporating general orders on disciplinary matters in written directives, and presenting thorough explanations of disciplinary policies in train\u00ad ing programs. 6 As used in this project, an attitudinal scale is a composite group of like instrument items with sufficient internal consistency to be used in tests of relationships, while an index is a set of items combined by the researchers to provide basic descriptive data on factors of interest. r ! )\" f 1 1 ' j I' : , 190 APPENDIX A Once sufficient data were obtained, these propositions were analyzed statistically through factor analysis and tests of relationships to determine (1) if questionnaire and administrative analysis data included ample material to test such suppositions, and (2) whether the effects of other factors, such as personal characteristics and experiences in discipline, precluded conclusive statements regarding these propositions. Througt\"t this process, the propositions were refined and a final set of measures selected. The next step in the analysis was the determination of the impact of personal factors, such as individual demographic criteria and experiences in dis\u00ad ciplinary matters, on results. All background factors included in the question\u00ad naire were compared with scales, indices and other selected items to ascertain degrees of variation in attitude according to personal differences. Significant relationships were noted, and variations were noted to determine the impact of these data on overall results. Agencies were then compared for scores on each scale and index, and con\u00ad clusions were derived. All findings were tested for significance and analyzed by background factors and other data to identify possible spurious relationships. Those findings which could well have been produced by chance or which were obtained due to some extraneous reason were then defined as inconclusive. STUDY DOMAIN The theoretical framework underlying this research centers on officer perceptions of mallagement actions in discipline. The rudiments of this design may be explained by indicating that in police agencies behavioral norms are delineated by management through formal directives and training programs, and further defined by the actions of commanders, supervisors and patrol officers. Each officer formulates his or her perception by aSSimilating fornlal instructions and then comparing this concept to what is observed in actual practice. Once actual experience occurs, perceptions of the quality of actions are possible. Each officer derives these perceptions from a variety of sources including feed\u00ad back received from supervisors and peers, as well as personal experiences. These perceptions in part establish the level of individual confidence in internal disci\u00ad pline. Officer confidence in discipline is therefore depr.,ldent to a certain extent on the type of management practices used to carry out diScipline. Such practices admittedly vary by type of agency; Ievl;'lls of confidence will necessarily vary across police agencies. This focus on agencies as one unit of analysis enabled the researchers to identify disciplinary practices which appeared to maximize Methodology alld Statistical Findings 191 officer confidence, and conversely those practices which were not perceived as satisfactory. This theoretical framework was selected to research several long estab\u00ad lished propositions in police administration. Management theorists and police practitioners alike stress that disciplinary processes should be based on several precepts crucial to sound management. First, all employees have a right to know exactly what is expected of them by management. Second, once employees are made aware of expectations, they should be held accountable for their conduct. And finally. disciplinary action, which is to be taken when violations occur should be positive in nature and imposed uniformly with as little delay a~ possible. Proponen ts of sound management have advocated adoption of such principles, among others, for many years. These theorists and practitioners have in addition recommended definitive procedures to be adopted by management for achieving such goals.7 Administraturs who implement these recommenda\u00ad tions expect to realize greater quality in discipline, as well as improvements in officer satisfaction. An inherent difficulty in adopting such recommendations is that most of these strategies are little more than untested concepts. Internal disciplinary prac\u00ad tices have been exposed to relatively little analYSis, and until recent years were basically unquestioned. Today, however, police officers and community groups are demanding more responsiveness throughout the disciplinary process. Many questions have been raised about the efficacy of internal policy decisions. This research proposed to describe internal diSCiplinary practices and, by comparing officer perceptions of results, to depict those procedures which appear most workable. Elements of the discipline process were analyzed through the administrative analysis. These elements, or correlates, were then analyzed from the officers' perspective to describe current conditions in sample agencies, and to compare actual practices with perceptions of quality. For purposes of this theoretical framework, disciplinary elements have been grouped into three categories. Correlates are defined from this theoretical perspective to guide quantitative analyses of officer perceptions. The three cate- 7 See for example George Strauss and Leonard R.

Specific recommendations of management theorists and practitioners will not be recapitulated in this appendix, but are stated in various portions of the text of this manual. . , r, I' 192 APPENDIX A gories are broken down by phases of the disciplinary process. Included are (1) methods of making known rules and procedures of conduct.~nd performance, (2) techniques of receiving and investigating comph;nts ofmisctll1duct, and (3) approaches for resolving cases of misconduct and handling appeals. ,2- Making Known Rules and Procedures From the moment the reciUit is sworn in as an officer, he or she is in\u00ad formed of certain agency expectations. This process begins with recruit training and is continued throughout the officer's career as management .promulgates new directives defining prescribed conduct and holds roll call or in;service train\u00ad ing for purposes of acquainting experienced officers with new or revised policies and procedures. A long-standing proposition among police administrators is that this process will be effective only when directives are .clearly delineated in an easily identifiable format, made avaiJable to all affected personnel, and revised as necessary. All alterations to existil;;!:: directives or newly prepared procedures or policies should be clearly explained to all officers to avoid contusion. The question which has not been asked, however, is, Do these procedures produce understanding of expectations, or is some other method of delineating expecta\u00ad tions more effective? Further, the foundation for understanding of norms and policies begins with the recruit training program. All recruits should be exposed .to a substantial discussion of rules of conduct and disciplinary procedures to maximize com\u00ad pliance and ease in operations. The same principle may be applied to all in\u00ad service training programs. Without a definitive explanation of expectations, officers may not understand management intentions and hence presc;ribed conduct. Each of these elements of the administrative process was analyzed in this research to determine if ag:tn>ies do, in fact, adhere to such principles and if such application is effective ~tn achieving officer understanding of written direc\u00ad tives in general, and of disciplinary procedures in particulai. The officer's understanding of standards of conduct is also largely affected -by management's conformance to prescribed norms of rules and procedures. Quite often this informal method of setting standards has the greatest impact on the officer's perception of what is and what is not expected behavior. To illus\u00ad trate, officers, upon observing management violations of internal policies for handling misconduct, may feel that the applicable policy is unworkable and perhaps undesirable. If, for example, an agency institutes a procedure for review\u00ad ing allegations of internal violations and this policy is consistently violated by Methodology alld Statistical Findings 193 members of the chain of command, line officers may feel tllat the procedure is ineffp.ctive. . To avoid misinterpretation, it has been advocated that standards of con\u00ad duct be applied equally for all personnel, regardless of rank or assignment, and that managers adhere consistently to established disciplinary procedures. Research was undertaken to determine the degree of perceived uniformity in disciplinary practices and the perceived extent of consistent application of rules of conduct among all personnel. Perceptions of the level of consistency in disci\u00ad pline are most important for it is such interpretations which guide understanding and thus confOl\"mity; Receiving and Investigating Complaints Once misconduct is suspected, the focus of the diSciplinary process shifts from setting expectations and ensuring accountability to determining the merit of the complaint. Divergent techniques are used for receiving externally as opposed to internally generated complaints. The specific method used for the investigation is chosen to ensure thoroughness and impartiality. Quite often, the agency's unit for internal investigations will handle all cases of a serious nature and monitor investigations conducted by supervisors. Key auestions which remain unanswered center on this distinction. Do officers understand the respon\u00ad sibility of the internal investigations unit, and if so, do they perceive this unit as. effective? Moreover, incidents of misconduct are often resolved at the immediate level ?f supervision. These incidents, frequently not recorded or challenged, are perceIved by officers as disciplinary events. If there are differences in officer perceptions of supervisory operations, what supervisory practices are related to this difference, and what outcomes occur? Certainly, supervisors are delegated and achieve varying levels of authority and possess different abilities. The manner in which these supervisory variances are applied will affect the percep\u00ad tions of events by officers. Two questions researched in this project are: What levels of quality in supervisory performance are perceived? and What practices are related to these perceptions? Other correlates are citizen complaint procedures, both for receiving com\u00ad plaints and conducting investigattons. Officers have often criticized management practices for handling such complaints, but. the question of whether or not officers actually understand these procedures is unresearched. And, if officers do understand this process do they, in fact, agree with it or are they totally opposed \" --i 'r 194 APPENDIX A to the existing practice? Throughout this project, such questions were asked in identifying and explaining differences in agency practice. The intent in this analysis was to detennine which practices elicit the most positive response by officers. Resolving Cases of Misconduct and Handling Appeals The completion of the investigation initiates review and resolution processes. Final internal decisions are then followed by the appeal procedure in which cases move from administrative control to external review. At this time, officers have a chance to question management decisions. This research has focused on the perceived quality of both internal review and decision-making practices and the appeals process. The question is asked, What review procedures, including channeling through the chain of command or use of an internal review board, or a combination thereof, produce the most positive response by officers? In this analysis, actions of supervisors, mid-management personnel and top level administrators are analyzed to determine perceptions of confidence. Certainly, the amount of involvement by each of these managers varies in each agency. This research has focused on perceptions of specific involvement. A critical element in the perception of quality is the appeals procedure. Officer knowledge of this process is measured in this research in conjunction with perceived levels of confidence. The intent is to describe perceptions of current appeals procedures, and to determine those factors leading to a positive response. Through such an approach, it is possible to determine if officers perceive external appeal procedures to provide a fairer review than internal processes. PROPOSITIONS AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS To assist in understanding relationships between variables several proposi\u00ad tions were developed. To ensure validity in measurement, composite scales were used in analyzing these propositions. Scales were devised by intuitively combin\u00ad ing like questionnaire items, factor analyzing results, and testing internal consistency of scale items. The resulting five scales were then used in describing differences in agencies. All scales had a reliability of .65 (coefficient alpha) or above. Each of these five propositions is analyzed in depth. The five scales achieving the desired reliability were perceived understanding of disciplinary pro\u00ad cedures, perceptions of supervisory behavior, perceptions of standards of con\u00ad duct, perceptions of fairness of internal review procedures, and perceptions of -~---------------------------------~ Methodology and Statistical Filldings I 195 t~e quality of methods of making known rules and procedures. The five proposi\u00ad tIons that were tested are: PI: A greater degree of clarity and definition in written procedures for di~cipline will produce a greater degree of understanding of disci\u00ad pl~nary procedures. P2: A greater degree of codified responsibility and training in super\u00ad visory disciplinary functions will produce a greater amount of positive response to supervisory behavior. P 3 : A greater degree of clarity and thoroughness of instructions in departmental standards will produce a greater amount of positive response to prescribed standards of conduct. P4: A greater degree of knowledge of and participation in decision\u00ad making procedures for internal discipline will produce a greater sense of officer cont1dence in agency review procedures. P 5 : A greater degree of clarity and thoroughness in methods of making known rules and procedures will produce a greater degree of positive perceptions of these methods. In addition, several composite indices (aggregate groups of like variables) ~ere analyzed across departments. This information was also extremely valuable\u00b7 ~n th.e process of deSCribing differences in disciplinary practices. The indices used 111 thiS research were: 1. Perceived fairness of rules of conduct as written 2. Perceived fairness of rules of conduct as enforced 3. Perceived fairness of outside agency appeal procedures 4. Perceived knowledge of citizen complaint procedures 5. Perceived fairness of citizen complaint procedures This an~ysis of management practices is essential in describing variances in s~m~l~ agenCIes. However, many other factors, not necessarily related to the dlsclplmary process, could possibly have an effect on officer perceptions. One group of such determinants is the background criteria of partiCipating officers. Several demog~ap~ic variables were measured in the questionnaire and analyzed by scales and mdlces to define possible differences in attitude. Such analyses 196 APPENDIX A were c:onducted to answer the f~liowing researci~ Do officer per'~ep\u00ad tions vary by the seniority, sgx, race, education, rank or assignment of partici- pating officers? - In addition, officer experiences in discipline were considered critical deter- minants of perceptions. Officers were asked if complaints had ever been filed against them, and secondly if complaints had ever been. sustained. Finally, those officers who had received disciplinary sanctions were asked to describe the type of sanction imposed. Each of these answers was analyzed by scales and indices to seek possible explanations for variance in responses. The following research question was answered in this process: Do officer perceptions vary by experi\u00ad ences in discipline? Officer level of involvement in the administrative process was researched to further define differences in perceptions. Those officers who had suggested changes in written directives were analyzed as a separate group, as were those officers who had appealed disciplinary decisions. Two questions were answered through this process: (1) Do officer perceptions vary if they have suggested changes in written directives and (2) D~o officer perceptions vary if they have appealed disciplinary decisions? The amount of satisfaction in present assigl1luent and in overall career were considered significant supplemental variables. These variables were analyzed by scales and indices to define differences among officers. The research questions posed to investigate such relationships were: (1) Do officer percep\u00ad tions vary by level of satisfaction in present assignment and (2) Do officer perceptions vary by level of satisfaction in >overall career? QUESTIONNAIRE DATA All survey findings are presented in eight topic areas to provide ease in reviewing results. The topic areas are: survey scores for all items; demographic and personal history data for sample officers; data scales and indices, including factor analyses results; correlations between personal data and experiences, and attitudes. The data are presented in total and, in some cases, by agency and groups of agencies. The sixteen participating agencies are coded in alphabetical form (A through P) to ensure anonymity. Statistical findings are accompanied by a brief narrative explaining the practical meaning of results. Several statistical n-------\u00b7----\u00b7------,l Methodology and Statistical Findings 197 formulas are used in reviewing these data. Each of these is described to assist the reader in interpreting results: 1. Mean-The average score of any set of data. The mean is computed by summing all possible scores and dividing by the number of scores. 2. Median-The middle score of any distribution. The median is that point in the distribution above which are located 50 percent of the scores and below which are located SO percent of the scores. The median is com\u00ad puted by finding the SOth percentile in the distribution. 3. Mode-The score which occurs most frequently in any set of data. 4. Correlation Coefficient-Correlation is a technique used to measure the association or relationship between any two variables. The correlation coefficient is one number which indicates the strength of the relation\u00ad ship. Coefficient scores range from + 1.00 to -1.00. A perfect positive relationship is noted by a score of +1.00. A -1.00 indicates perfect negative correlation. A correlation of zero indicates no relationship between the variables. The closer a score approximates +1.00, the stronger the positive relationship, and the closer the score approximates -1.00, the stronger the negative relationship. For these data, a Spear\u00ad man rank difference correlation coefficient is used to measure differ\u00ad ence in groups of data. The Spearman coefficient is symbolized by rs' S. Chi-Square Test-The chi-square test is used to measure the relationship in sets of variables. The chi-square score is symbolized as X2 and is calculated by testing differences between all score categories for sets of variables. An obtained chi-square value is compared with a predeter\u00ad mined value of significance using the appropriate degrees of freedom. The degrees of freedom are directly related to the number of categories of data used, and must be considered in selecting the predetermined value. If the obtained chi-square value exceeds the predetermined value, it is concluded that there is a relationship between the two variables. 6. Brandt Snedecor Test-A variation of the chi-square test used to mea\u00ad sure the independence of any two sets of variables arranged into a 2 x k table (2 columns and k rows), where k may vary to accommodate two or more categories of data. 7. Factor Analysis-This statistical technique is used to test a set of data 198 APPENDIX A to determine if any underlying pattern of relationships exists among items. Factor analysis rearranges variables into a smaller group of items that can be used to describe observations about the data. Factor analy\u00ad sis does not specify exactly what the common pattern is among items. The researcher must infer like patterns from observation. Each variable is correlated with common factors. Correlation scores are produced indicating the strength of relationship between each variable and the common factor (these scores are defined as factor loadings). As is the case with all correla.tions, scores range from -1.00 to + 1.00. 8. Coefficient Alpha-This is a measure of the internal consistency of a grouped set of variables. Coefficient alpha is based on the average cor\u00ad relations among variables and the number of variables. Coefficient scores closest to + 1.00 indicate greatest internal consistency, which is a measure of the reliability of the data. 9. Statistical Significance-Throughout this review, reference is made to statistical Significance. This concept is used in research as a standard for determining confidence when drawing conclusions about relation\u00ad ships between variables. It is important to determine if a sample rela\u00ad tionship is representative of the entire population; that is, if similar results could be obtained in repeated studies. The test of significance determines how many times the result would be obtained by pure chance and is therefore not representative. A .05 level of significance indicates that the result would occur by chance only five times in 100 similar studies. Considerable confidence .:an be placed in relationships showing such significance. The .05 level of significance is used as a standard in this study. However, levels of significance showing a stronger relationship (e.g., .01, .001) are also reported. The level of significance is indicated by the p value (e.g., p = .05) for all tests of relationships. At certain points in this analysis, a p value smaller than .0001 was obtained. Tn such case, values are truncated to four decimal points and reported as p = .0001. FREQUENCY SCORES FOR ATTITUDINAL SURVEY ITEMS Frequency scores were obtained for each survey item to determine the actual numbers of officers responding in the five categories (strongly agree, Methodology and Statistical Findings 199 agree, uncertain, disagree, strongly disagree).8 These results are presented below in percentages. Median scores are given for each question in which ranked data were obtained (strongly agree through strongly disagree), and the actual number of responses are cited for each question. A total of 2,165 officers representing sixteen agencies completed the survey. However, in some cases certain questions were omitted. Question 1: Definitions of Discipline Based on Overall Experience in Sample Department 22 Behavior according to police standards of misconduct 30 An attitude which causes officers to obey police standards of conduct 20 Training or counseling to improve police officer performance 24 Punishment for officer misconduct 2 Other, please specify ______________ _ N = 2128 No median is calculated for this item since it is a nonranked question. Question 2: Perceived Fairness of Rules and Regulations, As Written 7 strongly agree; 61 agree; 13 uncertain; 15 disagree; 4 strongly disagree N = 2099 Median = 2.21 Question 3: Perceived Fairness of Enforcement of Rules and Regulations 3 strongly agree; 32 agree; 18 uncertain; 32 disagree; 15 strongly disagree N =2096 Median = 3.34 Question 4: Perceived Fairness of Specific Rules, As Written This question, consisting of fifteen items, was presented as a chart of rules and regulations. Officers were asked to give a reaction to each rule and regula\u00ad tion listed. If they disagreed or strongly disagreed, they were asked to select a reason for their score from an accompanying chart. Scores are presented below for each rule and reasons for disagreement are cited immediately 8The survey instrument used is presented in Appendix C. 200 APPENDIX A following the listing of percentages. It should be remembered that the per\u00ad centages cited for reasons apply only to rf'~ponses of disagree or strongly disagree.

Specifically, these analyses were undertaken to determine if any type of officer was more likely to be involved in disciplinary situations, was more likely to suggest changes in written directives, or was more satisfied in his or her present career or overall assignment. All data were intercorrelated through cross\u00ad tabulations. Findings are presented below in three categories: ]. Personal background data (seniority, sex, race, education, rank, assign\u00ad ment) correlated with disciplinary experiences (filing of complaint, sus\u00ad taining of complaint, types of complaints taken, and filing of appeal); 2. Personal background data (same as above) correlated with suggestions of changes in written directives; 3. Personal background data correlated with satisfaction in present assign\u00ad ment and overall career. Tables 14-16 depict chi-square scores (X2) for relationships significant at the p = .05 or greater. Degrees of freedom are also specified and denoted as (DF = _). Significance levels are included and presented as (p = _). An asterisk (*) indicates that a significant value was obtained but findings were con\u00ad sidered inconclusive due to small numbers of cases (N of less than 30). For this reason, caution must be used in generalizing results. The principal finding in this analysis is that seniority, more than any other personal background variable, is related to receiving complaints and receiving Some form of sanction for misconduct. As seniority increases, the numbers of 224 APPENDIX A complaints received 'and sustained increases for sample officers: Also, older officers are more likely to receive formal oral reprimands, written reprimands, work days off in lieu of suspension and be suspended than are younger officers. These results are understandable since increases in seniority may be accompanied by increases in opportunities to engage in any form of misconduct or to be charged with an allegation. An interesting finding is that for several of the correlations in disciplinary experiences (filing of complaint, sustaining of complaint, receiving written repri\u00ad mand and working days off in lieu of suspension), reported incidents of discipline increase with experience until officers reach the over twelve-year category. This result implies that officers reach a specific plateau where incidence of discipline no longer increases with seniority. One reason for this finding may be that a large percentage of officers in the over twelve-year category are mid-level com\u00ad manders, who are less likely to be charged with misconduct (an additional analysis not reported herein showed that commanders were more likely to have greater than twelve years of service than any other seniority category). Other findings worthy of consideration are correlations between the following: 1. Race and Disciplina/y Experiences-Generally, white officers received fewer allegations and disciplinary sanctions than either blacks or Mexican-Americans. Only for the category of working days off in lieu of suspension did white officers report a greater number of sanctions, and this difference may be explained by the relative difference in seniority between whites and blacks (black officers have less experience overall). This type of punishment is being phased out in many agencies; thus, those officers with greater experience may have had more occa\u00ad sion to receive such sanction. Another interesting finding concerns reported filing of appeals. While only a small percentage of both black and white officers reported an appeal, it was found the!. all Mexican\u00ad American officers in the sample had appealed a disciplinary action. 2. Sex and Disciplil1a/y Experiences-Findings in this category are not fully conclusive due to the relatively small numbers of females in the sample (42). Female officers reported slightly fewer incidents of com\u00ad plaints and disciplinary sanctions. This result may be explained, how\u00ad ever, by differences in seniority between males and females (greater numbers of female officers have been hired recently in most agencies studied). r en (,,) l- en a: w \\-<1: -l 2 et- 2~ 0-en(,,) a: en wEi a. u.C 02 en et 2 o l- et -l W a: a: o U ... ., en o en 0 0 M<tC!

Education and Disciplina/y Experiences-Overall, an increase in educa\u00ad tional attainment is accompanied by increases in the likelihood of receiving formal complaints, although one interesting exception to this pattern was noted. The corresponding increases in complaints occurred in all categories except that which included college graduates (B.A. degree). This finding implies that such officers are less likely to receive complaints. 4. Rank and Disciplinary Experiences-Very little relationship is noted between rank and disciplinary experience. One of only two significant findings (a relationship of rank to receipt of formal oral reprimand) indicates that higher ranking officers may be less inclined to receive such a sanction. The other finding (filing of appeals) shows that the higher the rank, the less likelihood of filing such an appeal. Methodology ami Statistical Fi/ldings 227 All personal background characteristics are related to suggesting changes in written directives as followe: 1. Seniority and Suggesting Changes-There is a definite relationship between these factors showing that more senior officers are more in\u00ad clined to suggest changes. 2. Sex and Suggesting Changes-Correlations show that male officers are more likely to suggest changes than female officers (most likely due to greater experience). 3. Race and Suggesting Cltanges- White officers in this sample are more apt to suggest changes in written directives than either black or Mexi\u00ad can-American officers. Differences in seniority and rank between these races may influence this result. 4. Education and Suggesting Changes-This correlation shows that the tendency to suggest change increases with greater levds of education . More officers who had received a B.A. degree reported that they had made suggestions than any other educational category. 5. Rank and Suggesting Clzanges- There is a marked increase in the amount of suggested changes with increases in rank. 6. Assignment and Suggesting Changes-The only difference in this cate\u00ad gory is with officers assigned to administrative positions. A much higher percentage of these officers reported making suggestions than either field operations personnel or investigative personnel. Similar percent\u00ad ages were reported by officers assigned to these two positions. Significant findings are examined below for relationships between reported satisfaction and each personal background characteristic: 1. Seniority and Satisfaction-These correlations demonstrate that officer satisfaction, in assignment and overall career, increases with seniority. One exception was found in these results. Satisfaction increases for officers with less than one year of experience, over one year but leJs than three years of experience, 5-12 years of experience, and for officers with over 12 years of service. However, this pattern of increas\u00ad ing satisfaction does not occur with officers of over three years but not greater than five years of service. This finding is consistent with inter-228 APPENDIX A view findings indicating that officers in this category often become most disgruntled with management practices. 2. Race and Satisfaction-Data analysis showed that white officers are slightly more satisfied in their assignments than black officers, and appreciably more satisfied than Mexican-American officers. 3. Rank and Satisfaction-Data correlations indicate that commanding officers are more satisfied than either supervisors or patrol officers, in both their present assignments and overall careers. There is a slight tendency for satisfaction to increase with promotions in rank. 4. Assignment and Satisfaction-Investigative personnel are somewhat more satisfied in present assignment than both patrol officers and administrative officers. Personnel in these two assignments expressed similar degrees of satisfaction with their assignments. Concerning satis\u00ad faction with career, administrative personnel and investigative officers responded similarly showing greater satisfaction than patrol officers. ATTITUDINAL SCALES AND INDICES Attitudinal scales and indices were constructed to reduce the number of study variables to manageable size. This process of combining common items made possible measurements of officer perceptions of several aspects of the discipline process. The scales to be discussed in this analysis are: perceived understanding of disciplinary procedures, perceptions of supervisory behavior, perceptions of agency standards of conduct, perceptions of fairness of internal review procedures, and perceptions of management techniques of making known expectations of conduct and procedures. Scales are used in this analysis to measure a concept (perceptions of management practices) and draw inferences concerning the ordering of sample departments with respect to these percep\u00ad tions. Through use of scales, it is also possible to test the relationship between a set of perceptions and specific demographic criteria (e.g., perceptions of internal revi.ew procedures as related to officer rank). Such relationships are tested in this analysis. The index is (l less precise form of measurement which is used in this analysis to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of additional officer perceptions. Selected groups of questions, which intuitively were thought to ~ If :1 I' i I Methodology and Statistical Findings 229 measure like factors, were treated as indices rather than scales due to either the lack of internal consistency in questions or the small number of questions actually measuring the specific perception. Although definitive mathematical conclusions cannot be drawn by analyzing these indices, it is possible to derive more meaning from the data using this form of analysis. Three indices will be discussed in this section: perceived officer awareness of citizen complaint pro\u00ad cedures, perceptions of the fairness of citizen complaint procedures, and percep\u00ad tions of the fairness of nondepartmental appeal procedures. In addition, officer perceptions of rules of conduct, as written and as enforced, are reported in this analysis. These data are not treated as scales or indices, but are analyzed in ranked categories of most fair and reasonable rules to least fair and reasonable rules. Coded alphabetical references for participating agencies will be used throughout this analysis for purposes of anonymity. The codes A through P represent sixteen departments participating in questionnaire administration. Scales Each of the five scales and accompanying analyses are presented below in the following order. The scales are described with questionnaire items presented, factor loadings are depicted demonstrating the relationship of questions to the scale, and the median, mode and number of actual responses (N) to the scale are provided. The reliability of the scale is then discussed to indicate internal consis\u00ad tency. Median scores for sample departments are then presented in graph form. These data are then analyzed by groups of agencies-the top four departments (receiving highest scores on the scale) and the lowest four departments (receiving lowest scores) are then compared by use of the chi-square test to examine dif\u00ad ferences in the two groups. A description of these differences then follows to identify management practices eliciting more favorable employee perceptions. Scale 1: Perceived Understanding of Disciplillary Procedures. TIlis scale consists of seven items derived from the questionnaire. The items measure perceived understanding of several aspects of the discipline process, including the citizen complaint procedure, the internal review procedure, and the pro\u00ad cedure for appeals outside the department (see table 17). The items were selected as a result of heavy loadings on the first factor obtained from the factor analysis of thirty-eight questions. An item measuring perceptions of fairness in internal review was included due to a high factor loading.

Through use of the chi-square test of independent 1 ! Methodology ami Statistical Findings 231 samples, it was possible to test if there was a significant difference between these two groups. A variation of the chi-square test, the Brandt-Snedecor test, was used for this analysis since the data were arranged into a 2 x 5 table (two samples and five categories of agreement). The number of officers in each group and their responses are reflected in table 18 below. TABLE 18 TEST OF INDErENDENCE OF GROUPS 1 AND 2 FOR SCALE 1 Attitude Strongly agree .... Agree .........

The analysis for this scale indicates that approxi\u00ad mately 50 percent of sample officers report a basic understanding of disciplinary procedures, but do not express full comprehension of these regulations. This conclusion is supported by the median scores for scale items, which range from 2.50 to 3.00 (figure 1). Since the median is equivalent to the 50th percentile, it can be inferred that close to 50 percent of the sample indicated either uncer\u00ad tainty or lack of understanding of these procedures. This conclusion is also sup\u00ad ported by field interviews in which many officers stated that they did not learn how the disciplinary process works unless they Were charged with misconduct. The analysis also shows that there is a significant difference in perceived officer understanding of diSCiplinary procedures between the top four agencies and the lowest four agencies. To understand why this difference exists, it is necessary to review management practices in these departments to identify pro\u00ad cedures or actions which may lead to better understanding in group 1, and practices which are not conducive to good understandin3 in group 2. This was accomplished by reviewing administrative analysis material. The foIIowmg results were obtained. The primary difference between these groups appears to be accurate delineation of and instruction in disciplinary procedures in groilp I, and out\u00ad dated and in some cases missing directives in group 2. The responsibilities of the internal affairs unit and the workings of the citizen complaint procedure are specifically documented in a much clearer and comprehensive manner in those departments in group 1, as opposed to those in group 2. The written directive systems of agencies in group 1 are by far superior to those in group 2; two agencies in group 2 (Depts. F and L) still operate from general order manuals which were published in 1965 and 1961 respectively and have not been updated since. Those agencies receiving the highest scores all make use of recent manuals of directives and have updated directives as needed. Department A, in particular, employs a system of reviewing every directive at least unce each year to ensure that it is current. Training also seemed to differ significantly between these two groups, specifically training in rules of conduct and disciplinary procedures. Whereas every agency in group 1 includes at least ten hours of training on rules and pro\u00ad cedures in their recruit program, those agencies in group 2 did not cover these procedures in such depth. And, the internal affairs function and the citizen com\u00ad plaint process in these four agencies is not covered at all. This lack of training appears significant in two of the lower four agencies (B and I), since in 1974 new directives were promulgated explaining the citizen complaint process, but these procedures. were never explained (in either recruit or in-service training) to officers.

These conclusions, tooether with the test score results discussed above, serve to support the proposi- '\" tion that \"a greater degree of clarity and definition in written procedures for discipline will produce a greater degree of understanding of (llsciplinary procedures. \" TABLE 19 SCALE 2 -ITEM ANALYSIS Item Factor No. Item Loading Median Mode N 26 Present supervisor is fair in determining facts in regard to misconduct ............. .754 2.02 2.00 2,139 27 Present supervisor does not show favoritism in deter- mining facts regarding misconduct .............. .749 2.14 2.00 2,141 8 Present supervisor does a good job when explain- ing new directives .......... .733 2.57 2.00 2,158 7 Present supervisor is consis- tent in enforcing written directives ................ .708 2.13 2.00 2,156 28 Present supervisor uses counseling and retraining to deal with misconduct ...... .643 2.79 2.00 2,141 17 When new or revised direc- tives are L\"ued, present supervisor explains them satisfactorily .............. .639 2.33 2.00 2,148 9 Officers feel free to suggest changes in written directives ................ .310 2.57 2.00 2,158 Total scale ............. .... 2.09 2.00 2,118 Scale 2: Perceptions of Supervisory Behavior. This scale, constructed from the second factor derived from the factor analysis procedure, consists of seven items addressing a variety of supervisory actions (see table 19). 'These items Methodology alld Statistical Findi/lgs 235 ascertain officer perceptions of actions in discipline, such as determining facts in investigations and tendency to use counseling rather than punishment, as well as overall management functions (e.g., explaining changes in directives). One item, included after factor analysis, measures officer perceptions of the climate to suggest changes in written directives. Answers to this question may possibly pertain to mid-management personnel, as well as supervisors. Reliability, A coefficient alpha of .810 was calculated for this scale indi\u00ad cating strong internal consistency among all items. Chi-square test. The Brandt-Snedecor test of independent samples was used to test for significant differences between group 1 consisting of the four departments receiving highest median scores on this scale (Depts.

Through scale analysis of officer perceptions of supervisory behavior, it is possible to draw conclusions concerning perceived quality in discipline related supervisory functions. As can be seen from the profile of department medians in figure 2, most all officers sampled elicited favorable opinions of their supervisors. Obtained medians of 1.86 to 2.37 indi\u00ad cate that an overwhelming majority of officers agree with measured supervisory practices. This result was not anticipated by IACP field researchers in light of many disparaging comments received about supervisorstluough field interviews. In several departments, Bne personnel stated that supervisors were inconsistent in administering discipline, did not fully comprehend their supervisory responsi\u00ad bilities in discipline in many cases, and did not do an adequate job when explain\u00ad ing new or revised policies or procedures. The fact that these opinions were not reflected in the data analysis is, therefore, somewhat startling. Two reasons for this difference were identified by IACP staff: 1. Officers do not view the first-line supervisor as an integral part of the management team, but instead perceive the supervisor as a member of the work force, similar to a foreman in private industry, and therefore may be reluctant to critically analyze his or her performance; 2. Officers were hesitant to reveal negative sentiments about their \"pres\u00ad ent supervisor\" for fear of reprisals (this feeling may have prevailed despite continuing IACP assurances that the questionnaire was com\u00ad pletely anonymous and would not be viewed by anyone in the organi\u00ad zation. The best possible interpretation is that a combination of these factors, as well as other differences, influenced these scores. The impact of these influences is reviewed further in analyzing differences between group 1 and group 2. The chi-square test shows a significant difference between group 1 and group 2. The administrative analysis instrument was reviewed to identify possible reasons for this result. It is difficult to arrive at striking differences between these two groups. However, some noteworthy observations should be mentioned. The major reason for divergent scores is varying levels of codified au\u00ad thority for discipline between groups 1 and 2. Whereas three of the four agencies in group 1 (Depts. D, L, and P) confer disciplinary authority on the supervisor for imposing at the minimum formal oral reprimands (and in two agencies written reprimands), there is little authority for discipline by supervisors in group 2 agencies.

The supervisor must document all incidents in these agencies, and receive permission from mid-management before imposing any type of sanction. Also, in Department C, the agency receiving lowest scores on t!lis measure, patrol officers complained vociferously about inconsistency in supervisory disCiplinary actions. (When answering question 7,62 percent of sampled officers expressed agreement with the statement that supervisors were consistent in enforcing written direc\u00ad tives. This result is 11 percent lower thlil1 the average for 16 departments surveyed.) In researching reasons for this finding, it was found that disCiplinary authority is poorly documented in this agency and also that there is a conflict in authority for investigations. (Whereas the investigative function is omitted in one rule delineating supervisor responsibilities, it is stated in another rule covering citizens complaints that \"supervisors shall receive and investigate complaints of misconduct.\" This conflict certainly may lead to officer confusion.) Another possible difference explaining scores is amounts of supervisory training. While such training was generally unsatisfactory in most agencies, it was observed that in two of the top four departments (Depts. Land P) first-line supervisors receive greater amounts of required training in management tech\u00ad niques than do supervisors in other agencies. Further, these two agencies had recently instituted in-service training for supervisors to clarify the supervisory role. Finally, it was noted that in the top four agencies, supervisors tended to do a better job in roll call instruction, and were thought to be closer to subor\u00ad dinates, thus maximizing opportunities to explain policies and procedures. This analysis demonstrates that greater clarity in explaining the super\u00ad visory role through written directives is related to higher perceptions of super\u00ad visors by employees. Also, greater supervisory competence in explaining rules and procedures is significant in obtaining such results. These findings support the proposition (P2) that a \"greater degree of codified responsibility and training in supervisory disciplinary functions will produce a greater amount of positive response to supervisory behavior.\" Scale 3: Perceptions of Standards of Conduct. The third scale obtained from the factor analysis contained high loadings on items measuring percep\u00ad tions of agency standards of conduct. Four items were included in this scale (see table 21), measuring desired standards of conduct for officers as opposed to civilian employees and the public at large, and also ascertaining officer opinions of the rule on conduct unbecoming as a standard to be used for proper behavior.

Overall conclusions, derived from this scale analy\u00ad sis, indicate that officers are in favor of higher standards of conduct for police officers as opposed to civilian employees in thair department, and to the public at large. Not one item in the scale received a median lower than 2.13 (figure 3), indicating many officers strongly agree with existing standards of conduct. Also significant is that sample officers strongly feel the need for a rule on conduct unbecoming. The chi-square results show a significant difference between group 1 and group 2. The proposition tested in this research was that \"a greater degree of clarity and tho,'oughness of instructions in departmental standards will produce a greater amoun; of positive response to prescribed standards of conduct.\" Data from the adminislrative analysis was researched to find possible reasons for the significant difference in groups. It was not found that agencies in group 1 defined standards OS} the whole any better than agencies in group 2. In fact, one department in group 1 (Dept. D) was still operating under an obsolete manual of conduct and procedures, and two agencies in group 2 (Depts. A and G) ade\u00ad quately defined standards of conduct in rules and regulations. The difference in these two groups seems to be caused more by internal conflict and employer-employee relationships rather than any definitive manage\u00ad ment practice in defining expectations. In all four of the agencies in group 2, this conflict was noticeable; in one department (Dept. K) the employee organization had considerably strained the labor-management relationship. In contrast, there seemed to be less tension of this type in the top four agencies. As a result of this finding, proposition P3 as stated above can only be labelled inconclusive in that no significant reason for differences was obtained in this research.

This set of measures demonstrates that officers in sixteen agencies do not place much confidence in exi~tin~ review proce~ur~s.

N u: Another reason for more positive perceptions is more clearly codified u diSciplinary authority. In the top four agencies, commanders and supervisors generally are given greater authority for taking action, and in three of the four agencies (Depts. E, Land P) this authority is stated clearly and concisely in co department directives. Authority for discipline is less clear in the four agencies in group 2; in only one agency (Dept. B) was the authority of commanders and \u00ab supervisors articulated in directives. Union involvement in discipline, in the form , of challenging management decisions, seems to be a factor affecting employee confidence in Departments F and K.

The Brandt-Snedecor test was used, as with previous scales, to test for independence between agencies in group 1 (Depts. L, P, Band E) and those in group 2 (Depts. I, D, K and F).

The analysis of scale results indicates that most officers perceive management methods of making known rules and procedures as satisfactory. The median scores for all items (ranging from 1.82 to 2.79) confirm this result (spe figure 5). Written directives, in particular, are thought to provide an understanding of what is expected. Training programs are perceived as ade\u00ad quate. However, in checking administrative analysis data, it is obvious that more attention should be given in training to discussions of rules of conduct and di~d\u00ad plinary procedures. Also noteworthy is the finding that many officers are uncertain about the amount of time taken for disciplinary decisions (median = 2.46) and the action of the chief of police in internal review (median = 2.79). The significant difference between group 1 and group 2 can perhaps best be explained by reviewing departmental directive systems. Agencies in group 1 utilize comprehensive directive systems including sections on rules of conduct. In three of the four departments included in group 2 (Depts. F, K and D), directive systems had not been revised for 9, 14 and 13 years respectively. Directives in many instances were not well indexed in these agencies and gener\u00ad ally were not used as authoritative documents to publicize expectations. Training also appears to be a reason for this difference. All departments in group 1 have longer training programs than those in group 2, and in all cases rules and regulations were discussed in greater detail in the first, as opposed to the second group. Finally, three of the four agencies in group 1 (Depts. L, P and E) imple\u00ad mented workable programs for seeking employee input in the directive system. Only one of the agencies in group 2 used such a system (Dept. D). These findings support proposition (Ps) that \"a greater degree of clarity and thoroughness in methods of making known rules and procedures will pro\u00ad duce a greater degree of positive perceptions of the~e methods.\" Indices The three indices were constructed from the attitudinal questionnaire to facilitate further analyses of officer perceptions of specific management prac\u00ad tices.

A correla\u00ad tion coefficient of .610 was calculated for these two items. A total of 2,150 officers was included in this measure. The major finding derived from this measure is that officers in many departments have misconceptions about the citizen complaint process. The answers to this measure are quite positive indicating that officers feel that com\u00ad plaints, regardless of how frivolous they may be, are recorded and investigated in their respective agencies. Administrative analysis findings in these agencies indicate that complaints may be handled informally _,d not documented. Officers ~eem to disregard this practice. This may occur due to the perceived minor nature of these complaints. While these officers most likely would become aware of publicized complaints to which the agency responds with a full-scale report and investigation, they would not be aware of minor complaints handled at the immediate level of supervision. It is also interesting to note that in several of the agencies in which highest scores occurred, management had recently publicized the importance of receiv\u00ad ing and recording all complaints of misconduct. Departments Band E, for example, promulgated general orders in 1974 explaining the citizen complaint process. On the other hand, many of the agencies in which lowest scores re\u00ad sulted either did not have a written directive on citizen complaint procedures or utilized outdated directive systems. Index 2. This index, which seeks officer assessment of how citizen com\u00ad plaint procedures should function, is constructed from two items (question 21: All citizen complaints, regardless of how minor, should be recorded and ques\u00ad tion 24: All citizen complaints, regardless of how minor, should be investigated) with a correlation coefficient of .649. A total of 2,152 officers was included in the analysis. Police offieers are not avidly inclined to accept arguments that all citizen complaints should be recorded and investigated, as indicated in this analysis. In nine of sixteen agencies, the most common score was 4.00, and in one depart\u00ad ment the mode was equal to 5.00. This result is not surprising since the acceptance and investigation of citizen complaints questions the credibility of an officer trying to perform his or her job. It is quite interesting to analyze results for this index, especially since in two agencies scores are quite atypical (Depts. F and L). High positive scores for these agencies seem to indicate that management has taken steps to educate employees of the values of a receptive citizen complaint process. Research results do not, however, confirm this assumption. It appears that other factors, i ,- /' ,l I ~--- - ,.'; \\ \" 252 APPENDIX A such as the small number of cItizen complaints and general harmony between citizens and police in Dept. L, and the lack of an efficient management process for both detecting and investigating complaints in Dept. F (officers in this agency are apparently unhappy with the inept approach of management for resolving complaints) produce such scores. Index 3. Officer perceptions of extra-departmental appeal procedures are analyzed through the use of this index. Two items make up the index. These items (question 40: I feel that appeal procedures outside this department give an officer a fairer review than do internal procedures, and question 39: I feel that an officer can get a \"fair shake\" through the appeal procedures outside this department) have a correlation coefficient of .210. A total of 2,149 cases was included in the calculation of this index. While most officers appear to be uncertain about these appeal procedures, the analysis does point out that perceptions vary with frequency of contact with appeal bodies. In Depts. A and C, for example, all suspensions of thirty and five days respectively must be reviewed through extra-departmental channels. Officers in these agencies are more negative about such procedures. On the other hand, officers in Depts. F, G, K and 0 are favorably disposed toward outside appeal procedures. Administrative analyses findings indicate that through such appeals in Depts. G and 0, officers will most likely receive lighter sanctions, while in Depts. F and K disciplinary decisions are frequently taken to arbitration with tlle officer receiving a less severe punishment. This finding demonstrates that officer confidence in appeals processes is not generated through formal policies, explained in training programs but instead is enhanced by favorable results of appeal decision-making bodies. Perceptions of Rules of Conduct Two charts (questions 4 and 5) were included in the attitudinal question\u00ad naire to measure officer perceptions of fourteen rules of conduct, as written and as enforced. A fifteenth rule could be added by the respondent, if so desired. Attitudes toward this added rule were mostly negative; as a result these are not included in the tables below. For each chart, rules were ranked from most agree\u00ad ment (ranked as 1) to least agreement (ranked as 14) to provide a concise measure of officer attitudes and to easily identify rules which seemingly create the most difficulty. Table 28 below presents the rank ordered results of officer perceptions of rules as written, while table 30 depicts results for analysis of perceptions of rules as enforced. A description of key findings follows each table. Officers were also requested to indicate reasons for disagreement.

'\" ..c: 0 4 4 3 2 3 2 4 3 3 2 2 4 4 3 3 2 The major conc)usion to be drawn from this analysis is that officers disagree most with rules of conduct affecting their personal, off-duty behavior. Traditionally, police agencies have attempted to control officer conduct by Metlzodology and Statistical Findings 257 promulgating rules prohibiting off-duty employment, monitoring personal finances, dictating residency requirements, and prescribing moral standards. While it cannot be said that most officers disagree with such rules (see pages 199-266 for a breakdown of actual scores) it may be concluded that the amount of disagreement is significant to warrant examination and possible revision of agency rules of conduct. The rule to which most disagreement is evident is that governing grooming standards. The debate over appearance requirements has become quite vocal in recent years, and in some agencies, including two of those visited by the IACP, management has relaxed its standards. This is another example of officers' resentment of traditional management attempts to control personal behavior. Many officers are quite vocal in their sentiments that police officers should not be required to look and act differently than much of society. Another interesting observation may be derived from analyzing officer perceptions of operational rules. Officers do not disagree with performance standards, such as courtesy to the public, use of physical force and late for duty. Even the rule on use of firearms, a regulation often criticized by police associa\u00ad tions, is perceived as quite fair and reasonable. These data indicate that officers disagree most heavily with rules that either affect their personal habits or lifestyles, or are stated in broad, ambiguous directives. These results plus those reflected in table 30 provide evidence that management should carefully reexamine rules which govern off-duty perfor\u00b7 mance and those which are by nature not stated clearly or concisely (e.g., insubordination, gratuities). Ranked responses to the rules of conduct, as enforced, are similar to answers obtained to the ranking of perceived fairness of the rules, as written . It is evident that off\u00b7duty employment and grooming regulations are not agreed with in written form, or as applied. Rules prohibiting use of alcohol off duty and criticism of the department also appear too difficult to enforce. As was the case with perceptions of written rules, officers do not disagree with the enforcement of operational rules governing, for example, courtesy to public, gratuities and use of firearms. From this analysis, it appears that officers of all ranks and in different departments are in agreement with these standards and assure that they are enforced fairly and reasonably. It should be remembered, in reviewing these results, that officers are less satisfied with the enforcement of rules of conduct than with the rules them\u00b7 selves (see pp. 206\u00b7212). The overwhelming reason for disagreement to enforcement for all rules of conduct studied and for all departments is supervisory inconsistency. This 258 APPENDIX A appears to be a major problem in police disciplinary systems. Inconsistency is also manifested through double standards of compliance for several rules of con\u00ad duct. Superior officers are perceived as not complying with these rules (e.g., use of alcohol off duty, mor~ conduct) while informing patrol officers that they should confornl. Many respondents checked the other category to indicate disagreement. In many cases, these answers were variations of the first seven reasons, and at other times were reflections of personal experiences. It is difficult to determine a common trend among these responses, and for this reason these data will not be reflected in this analysis. CORRELATIONS BETWEEN PERSONAL BACKGROUND DATA AND DISCIPLINARY EXPERIENCES, AND ATTITUDES Another type of analysis was conducted to examine further the relation\u00ad ship between officer background factors and experiences, and their attitudes. Eighteen background factors (appearing in tables 1-13) were compared with eight attitude measures in cross tabulations tested with the chi-square statistic. The scales and indices discussed previously were used as measures: Scale 1: Perceived understanding of Disciplinary Procedures Scale 2: Perceptions of Supervisory BehaVIOr Scale 3: Perceptions of Standards of Conduct Scale 4: Perceived Fairness of Review Procedures Scale 5: Methods of Making Known Rules and Procedures Index 1: Knowledge of Citizen Complaint Procedures Index 2: Perceived Fairness of Citizen Complaint Procedures Index 3: Perceived Fairness of Outside Appeals Procedures Whereas previous analyses revealed relationships among background fac\u00ad tors, and variation among departments on these factors, this analysis addresses background/attitude relationships. The results identify trends which may be useful in considering personnel decisions to which attitudes are sensitive. The results of these comparisons are given in Table 32. The entries in this table are levels of significance of the possible relationships denoted by the matrix. No entry appears when the test yielded a significance value numerically Methodology and Statistical Findings 259 greater than .05 (suggesting a lack of real relationship). All values shown indicate a probable relationship, and smaller numbers suggest that the observed relation\u00ad ships are more likely to be real, and have not arisen simply by chance. The background factors having the most consistent relationship with all other measures are seniority, rank, and assignment. When the underlying data are examined, it is found that more positive attitudes on all but one or two of the eight measures are held by those officers with longer service and higher r?nk, an? those in administrative assignments rather than patrol and investiga\u00ad tIon. ThiS pattern suggests that those officers who stay in the department and progress through the ranks tend to take an accepting or positive view of most aspects of the way discipline is handled. In many cases, of course, these higher-ranking administrators are per\u00ad sonally involved and responsible for making the system work, and would thus reflect this \"ownership\" in their responses. Additional evidence of a generalized positive attitude or \"halo,\" operating in these data is seen in the satisfaction factors in Table 32. Individuals who expressed higher levels of satisfaction with their assignments and careers also showed a more positive attitude on seven of the eight measures concerning discipline. Another area of interest in these data concerns officer involvement with complaints. Those officers against whom complaints had been tiled or sustained, or who had appealed complaints, had a less positive attitude on six of the eight measures. This kind of result may be inevitable, but it draws attention to the possibility of debriefing such individuals routinely, to learn what parts of their experience they perceived as unjust, and their reasons. It may be possible in this way to discover features of the system which can be changed to improve both technical effectivene~s and officer acceptance. It is interesting also to note the attitudes of officers who suggested changes in written directives. On four of the five measures for which there was a signifi\u00ad cant relationship, these officers had a generally positive attitude. Only on Index 3, concerning outside appeals, was their attitude more negative than those who did not suggest changes. Of particular interest is the relationship between this measure and Scale 1. Those officers who reported suggesting changes stated that they understood disciplinary procedures better than those who did not. This finding gives additional support to the general principle that police man\u00ad agement can benefit from encouraging officer involvement in policymaking, under proper conditions. A great deal of further analysis of the relationships in table 32 is possible. Only limited exploratory work could be done within the resources of this study. One analysis, undertaken to further test relationships, involved holding constant I .} 260 TABLE 32 CORRELATIONS OF Or-FICER BACKGROUND DATA WITH SCALES/INDICES Scale 1 2 3 4 d sample (less than thirty officers) b \"These four results are based on a restncter h t they had been demoted or dismissed, relatively small incidence of reports by of Icers t a . . . . erience measures and testing the strength of either satisfaction or dlsclplmary exp d l'. t s and attitudes Through this nal backgroun Jac or . relations!up between perso '!

Perea v. F~les, 114 Cal. Rptr. 808 (Ct. App. 1974)-A police officer who d.ro'/e at hIgh speed through a residential neighborhood while off duty was gIven a five-d~y suspensi?n for conduct unbecoming.

And second, the conduct must be of the type which common knowledge or department practice indicate is unbecoming, so that the officer has adequate notice that a violation may occur. 4. PhilIi~s v. Adult Probation Department, 491 F.2d 951 (9th Cir. 1974)\u00ad Sustall1ed ~1~ suspension of a probation officer who displayed posters of wanted fugItIves (e.g., H. R. Brown, A. Davis, E. Cleaver) despite the fact that there was not any specific probation department regulation which pre\u00ad cluded the placing of posters on walls of offices. In rejecting Phillips' First Ame.ndment arguments, the court stated that \"it is not essential that a publIc employer spell out in detail all conduct which is deemed improper and may result in disciplinary action.\" 5. Fora~ v. Murphy, 342 N.Y.S.2d.4 (1973)-Upheld the forfeiture of thirty ?ays ,~a~ of an., officer for lymg during an official police department mv~stIgatlOn despIte the fact that the grand jury failed to indict Foran for perJ~ry.

Milwaukee Civil Service Commission, 212 N.W.2d 158 (WIS. 1973)-Holds that where hospital attendant was disciplined for absenteei~m and tardiness, to use the same acts for a charge of conduct unbecommg an employee is to torture tha rule beyond its plain meaning.

King v. City of Gary, 296 N.E.2d 429 (Ind. 1973)-Held that Civil Service Commission's findings that police officer, engaged in lsambling and drinking of intoxicating liquor while at gambling house where officer displayed cocked gun and demanded that his losses be repaid to him, supported con\u00ad secutive 90-day suspensions for engaging in conduct unbecoming a police officer and for engaging in immoral conduct. 10. Paris v. Civil Service Commission, 510 P.2d 910 (Colo. Ct. App. 1973)\u00ad Holds that the filing of a libel suit against an employer is not in and of itself a sufficient predicate for removal under a statute which proscribes conduct unbecoming to a state employee and which requires state employees to maintain \"satisfactory and harmonious working relationships with other employees.\" The initiation of the suit, however, can be considered along with other actions as conduct unbecoming a state employee and insubor\u00ad dination and disloyalty. 11. Stolte v. Laird, 353 F. Supp. 1392 (D.D.C. 1972)-Overturned the court martial of soldiers who were distributing antiwar leaflets while off duty and while in civilian clothes. The court, in ruling that the First Amendment sanctioned the plaintiffs conduct, stated that \"to proscribe speech by servicemen there must be truly direct and palpable prejudice to good mili\u00ad tary order and discipline.\" (Reasoning may not survive in light of holding in Parker v. Levy, infra.) 12. Rogenski v. Board of Fire and Police Commission, 285 N.E.2d 230 (Ill. 1972)-Reversed the dismissal 0f a policeman for conduct ynbecoming an officer who, while giving an elderly woman a ride in his cruiser and while inadvertently leaving his radio on, discussed politics and used profanities.

City of Bethlehem, 289 A.2d 767 (Pa. 1972)--Affirmed the dis\u00ad missal of a police officer for engaging in intimate activities with a woman who was not his wife. \"Unbecoming conduct on the part of a municipal employee, especially a policeman or fireman, is any conduct which ad\u00ad versely affects the morale or efficiency of the bureau to which he is assigned.\" ~: 14.

Gerace v. Los Angeles, 100 CaJ. Rptr. 917 (Ct. App. 1972)--Holds that the fact that deputies, who confessed during departmental investigation to violating abortion laws, would have been discharged if they failed to answer questions, or had given untruthful answers, did not preclude use of the con\u00ad fessions as a basis for discharge where they were granted immunity from use of the confessions in any crimim, I prosecutions. 17. Commissioners of Civil Service v. Municipal Court, 268 N.E.2d 346 (Mass. 1971)-Holds that the record sustained findings of the hearing officer that the discharged employee had been guilty of conduct unbecoming a police officer in two assaults on a fellow officer, and the record fniled to disclose any basis for the municipal court judge's conclusion that the decision of the hearing .officer was not justified; absence of such a basis was an error of law. 18. Olivo v. Kirwan, 322 N.Y.S.2d 844 (App. Div. 1971)-H.olds that efforts to \"fix\" two traffic ticke. one for individual with a record and bad reputa\u00ad tion, combined with attempt to persuade a justice of the peace to refuse to cooperate with a state police investigation, were serious in nature and grossly inconsistent with the integrity expected from one in a trooper's position of great sensitivity and trust, and dismissal was not dispropor\u00ad tionate to the offense. 19. Wright v. Looney, 323 N.Y.S.2d 702 {l971)-Holds that suspension was sufficient for a charge that the petitioner has misappropriated departmental property by converting two gallons of gasoline to his personal use, and that the penalty of dismissal was excessive and abuse of discretion. 20. Kammerer v. Board of Fire and Police Commissioners, 256 N.E.2d 12 (Ill. 1970)-Holds that evidence in disciplinary proceeding against police officer who allegedly kicked squad car and made unauthorized radio transmissio~ impugning the character of chief of police, was sufficient to justify dismis\u00ad sal, and dismissal was not arbitrary or contrary to great weight of evidence. 21. City of Little Rock v. Hall, 459 S.W.2d 119 (Ark. 1970)-Holds that even though circuit court confirmed city Civil Service Commission's finding that :1 __ \"'''''-''.<0#0 __ ._....:1 . \"._ 274 APPENDIX B police officer had violated regulations by slapping a suspected felon, circuit court could reduce punishment to a 30-day suspension notwithstanding the Commission's decision that the officer should be discharged. 22. Kryvicky v. Hamtramck Civil Service Commission, 170 N.W.2d 195 (Mich. CL App. 1969)-Holds that testimony of bar owner, customer of bar, and several police officers present at station where dismissed officer was booked and charged indicating that officer, while off duty, had bep.n annoying and molesting other patrons of bar and that commotion had developed when dismissed officer was taken to police station was sufficient to warrant dismissal, though officer had been founel not guilty on charge of disordt:rly conduct. 23. DeGrazio v. Civil Service Commission, 202 N.E.2d 522 (Ill. 1969)-Holds that findings of Civil Service Commission that police lieutenant was guilty of conduct unbecoming a police officer by reason of a trip to Europe with certain individual whose reputation was bad, and that by reason thereof cause existed for lieutenant's discharge, was not contrary to manifest weight of the evidence, and hence the order of the Commission discharging the lieutenant was proper. 24. Etscheid v. Police Board, 197 ,N.E.2d 484 (Ill. App. 1969)-Holds that Police Board's discharge of policeman for appearing in public attired in women's undergarments was not unreasonable or arbitrary. 25. Orlandi v. State Personnel Board, 69 Cal. Rptr. 177 (Ct. App. 1968)-Holds that state traffic officer's fixing of a ticket was the sort of behavior which would cause discredit to the Highway Patrol and to the state traffic officer so as to come within statute authorizing punitive action. 26. Belshaw v. City of Berkeley, 54 Cal. Rptr. 727 (Ct. App. 1966)-Holds that the letter written by a fireman and published in a newspaper was nothing more than an exercise of his constitutionally protected right of free speech, for which, in the absence of a showing that his conduct impaired the public service, he could not properly be punished under the personnel rules of the city or the rules of the fire department. 27. Smith v. Landsden, 370 S.W.2d 557 (Tenn. 1963)-Held that evidence supported charge of neglect of duty and charges that officer violated depart\u00ad mental rules in rf!vealing proposed movements or actions of the police department to unauthorized persons. Therefore Commission's acts as to dismissed employee was valid and could not be controverted in a col\u00ad lateral issue. 28. Campbell v. Hot Springs, 341 S.W.2d 225 (Ark. 1960)-Holds that the city attorney had authority to prosecute an appeal from the Civil Service --11--- I ~ 1 I ! 1 1 i 1 I Selected Cases all Police Discipline 275 Commission ordering reinstatement of the petitioner and that the evidence sustained the judgment of dismissal of the petitioner for working in a gambling house in the city on his off hours. 29. Barr v. San Diego, Cal. Rptr. 510 (Ct. App. 1969)-Holds that the record indicated that findings and decisions by Civil Service Commission which ordered officer's discharge for conduct unbecoming an officer after marijuana was found in his possession were supported by substantial evi\u00ad dence, that officer was not denied a full and fair hearing before Commis\u00ad sion and that statutory rules of procedure were substantially followed by the Commission, which did not exceed its jurisdiction. 30. State v. Miami Beach, 97 So.2d 349 (Fla. Ct. App. J957)-Holds that where a police officer, in following the dictates of an order of his superior, placed the operator of a city automobile under arrest upon his failure to prcduce a current driver's license, even though city might have been embarrassed by the actions of such police officer; nevertheless, under the ci{cumstances, charges made against the police officer that he falsely and maliciously arrested the operator of a municipal automobile, knowing that such arrest would hinder and delay performance of the operator's official mission to the detriment of the city, did not constitute just cause for his dismissal. 31. Yielding v. Stevens, 92 So.2d 895 (Ala. 1957)-Holds that in proceeding on charge that detective was guilty of conduct unbecoming a public employee because he had been party to a plan to embarrass the police chief by men\u00ad tioning alleged payments to him and to coerce police chief into changing his testimony regarding detective's grades and of raising detective's grades, where evidence was undisputed that detective remained silent at one end of the room and took no part in conversation or negotiation with chief of police, finding of Personnel Board against defendant was not supported by any legal evidence. 32. Gaudette v. Board of Public Safety, 127 A.2d 836 (Conn. Super. 1956)\u00ad Holds that where police officer failed to cooperate in investigation of a theft and withheld information concerning it and was guilty of insubordination, Board's action in dismissing him was not illegal.

Civil Service Commission, 244 N.W.2d 609 (Mich. Ct. App. 1976)-Police officer was discharged for knowingly leaving scene of an accident in which he was involved. Basis for discharge was violation of rule which held conduct unbecoming an officer to include any act or conduct not specifically mentioned in the rules which tends to bring the department into disrepute, or reflects discredit upon the individual as an officer. This provision was held not to be unconstitutionally vague in light of Parker II. Levy, infra. 2. Bence v. Breier, 501 F.2d cert. 419 U.S. 1121 (1975)-Statute allowing disciplinary action for \"conduct unbecoming a member and detrimental to the service\" held unconstitutionally vague. Vagueness permits arbitrary enforcement and chills First Amendment rights. :'Conduct unbecoming\" standards have fixed meaning in the military which IS not transferable to civilian police context. 3.

Cif. 1973), rev'd, 418 U.S. 676 (1974)-The Court of Appeals ruled that the General Articles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice were unconstitutional.

Allen v. City of Greensboro, 322 F. Supp. 873 (M.D.N.C. 1971)-Holds that administrative proceedings resulting in the demotion of policeman did not deny him substantive due process ofIaw on grounds that charge against policeman of condUcting himself in a manner unbecoming an officer and a gentleman was vague and overly broad, where policeman knew that conduct for which he was charged was within proscription of regulation and he suf\u00ad fered no uncertainty regarding propriety of his behavior. 6. Gee v. California State Personnel Board, 85 Cal. Rptr. 762 (Ct. App. 1970) -Holds that, in regard to civil service auditor, rule proscribing conduct that causes discredit to the agency applies to conduct whether publicizGd or not. Court rejects void for vagueness argument stating that there are many acts so inherently wrong and reprehensible that they need not be listed by the agency. 7. SEE ALSO: Arnett v.

City and County of San Francisco, 541 F.2d 841 (9th Cif. 1976)-Police department regulation proscribing unofficer-like conduct as tending to subvert good order, efficiency, or discipline of department, was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to police lieutenant who was suspended for making disrespectful and disparaging remarks about a superior officer while addressing his subordinates during morning inspec\u00ad tions. 2. Hanneman v. Department con\u00ad fidentiality was unconstitutionally applied to officers who had dis\u00ad tributed a letter confirming the existence of an internal police investigation, when the existence of the investigation had already been publicized and the letter contained no statements which were known to be false or which were made with reckless disregard for the truth.

Wis. 1975)\u00ad Holds that police officers may not be disciplined under a rule requiring confidentiality of police business for discussing race and sex discrimination within the department with federal investigators. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employer retaliation against employees who cooperate in federal investigations. The employees were also permitted to give interviews to federal agents without prior approval from the chief, and need not file post-interview reports. 4. Aycock v. Police Committee, 212 S.E.2d 456 (Ga. Ct. App. 1975)-Held that an officer could be summarily discharged for publicly criticizing the official actions of his superior officers, since department's rules prohibiting such conduct are reasonable and necessary to maintain good order, disci\u00ad pline and efficiency within the department. The court also ruled that due process did not require a hearing before rather than after the officer's discharge. 5. Magri v. Giarrusso, 379 F. Supp. 353 (E.D. La'. 1974)-Sustained the dismis\u00ad sal of a police sergeant who made derogatory statements concerning the police superintendent and other public officials.

Janetta v. Cole, 493 F.2d 1334 (4th Cir. 1974)-Discharge of fireman for circulating a petition critical of department policy violated his constitu\u00ad tional rights, in absence of showing that his actiun,~ interfered witIt the effiCiency of the public services performed by the department. 7. Amburgey v. Cassady, 370 F. Supp, 571 (E.D. Ky. 1974)-Discharg(! of teacher for excessive and abusive criticism of superior did not violate First Amendment rights. PJght to comment must be balanced against interest of school in regulating speech which interferes with its operation. First Amend\u00ad ment does not protect insulting and profane persona! statements about individuflJs not touching upon factual issues (,r' public or private concern. 8. Nebraska Department of Roads Employees' Association v. Nebraska Depart\u00ad ment of Roads, 364 F. Supp. 251 (D.

Pa. 1973)-Holds that discharge of nurse fo~ow1l1g pubh.ca\u00ad tion of news article in which she was critical of patient care 111 state hospital at which she was formerly employed violated First Amendment rights. In absence of showing that speech creates adverse effect on operation of hos\u00ad pital, criticism may not be suppressed. Mere staff anxiety is not sufficient reason for discharge. 11. Dendor v. Board of Fire and Police Commissioners, 297 N.E.2d 316 (Ill. App. 1973)-Discharge of fireman for public criticism of his superior not proper in the absence of a finding of adverse effect on department.

Johnson v. Santa Clara, 106 Cal. Rptr. 862 (Ct. App. 1973)-Holds that suspension of probation officer for posting a poem protesting his tran~fer did not violate First Amendment rights. State must show the practIcal necessity of limiting First Amendment exercise, although in this case there was no showing of interference with the efficiency or delivery of the depart\u00ad ment's services. Disciplinary action was based on what poem revealed of employee's attitude toward superior authority. 13. Meehan v. Macy, 392 F.2d 822 (D.C. Cir. 1968)-Di5charge of Canal Zone police officer for publishing defamatory attack on Governor of Canal Zone did not violate First Amendment rights.

Ruddick, 243 So.2d 566 (MISS. 1971)\u00ad Evidence was sufficient to support police chiefs order discharging, under Municinal Civil Service Act, a police department clerk-typist who allegedly stated ~hat \"Captain __ 's wife was a whore prior to the time she married Captain ___ ,\" on grounds of wantonly offensive conduct or la~guage toward public, superior or fellow employees and conduct unbecom1l1g to 280 APPENDIX B employee of city either while on or off duty, as having been made in good faith for cause. 15. Flynn v. Giarrusso, 321 F. Supp. 1295 (E.D. La. 1971)-Suspension of police cfficer for writing an article critical of police administration could not be sustained where it was based on regulations which were, on their face, unconstitutional, and police officer was entitled to reinstatement and back pay and other benefits he would have received had he not been sus\u00ad pended. 16. Muller v. Conlisk, 429 F.2d 901 (7th Cir. 19?O)-Police department's rule prohibiting policeman from engaging in any activity, conversation, delibera\u00ad Hon or discussion which is derogatory to the department or to any member or policy of the department was overbroad and invalid. Reprimand given on alleged violations of invalid rule must be expunged from police officer's record and held to be of no effect. 17. Brukiewa v. Police Commissioner, 263 A.2d 210 (Md. 1970)-Police officer's alleged public criticism of police department wherein he stated that the reporting system and patrol procedure were problems, that the depart\u00ad ment's morale had \"hit its lowest ebb,\" and that, in relation to what would happen within the next six months if the situation continued, \"I feel the bottom is going to fallout of this city,\" where the statements were not directed toward a superior with whom officer would come in daily or fre\u00ad quent contact and were not shown to have affected discipline or harmony or genera,! efficiency or effectiveness of police department, did not go beyond bounds of permissible free speech for which police officer could be disciplined. IS. In re Gioglio, 248 A.2d 570 (N.J. Super. 1965)-Evidence, including attitude expressed by police officer that he intended to fight order issued him by police chief to report for duty with uniformed patrol, together with impression he left with director of department that he did not intend to obey the order and the fact that he appeared at a meeting of the Board of Commissioners to castigate the police chief and further his claim for paid time off in lieu of compensation for overtime worked, indicated that his failure to report for duty was willful, and was sufficient to support his con\u00ad viction in departmental proceedings for insubordination and absence with\u00ad out leave. 19.

App. Ct. 1976)-Police officer's discharge for alleged neglect of duty based on his reporting 8-10 minutes late was overturned for the board had presented no evidence refuting the truth of the officer's explanation, which on its face appeared to be a valid and excusable reawn for being late (mechanical difficulties with car). The court also hel.d t~lat ~2 prior charges for which the officer had been reprimand.ed, though 1l1dlca~lve of prior poor performance, could not be used to establIsh that he was gUilty of the charoe for which he had been dismissed. 2.

App. Ct. 1975)-Police chief's testimony that he had observed the officer asleep on duty for approximately 3-5 minutes, though contradicted by the officer, represented the sole evidence in his discharge for neglect of duty.

City of Shreveport, 387 F. Supp. 1277 (W.D, La. 1975)-Holds that a police officer cannot be discharged for seeking voluntary bankruptcy, since this would frustrate the purposes of the federal bankruptcy laws which are designed to give the debtor a chance to start over in life. Prohibiting ftling for bankruptcy may increase the likelihood of police corruption, since the oHicer might seek illicit sources of income to settle his debts rather than face losing his job. 3.

Fantozzi v. Board of Fire and Police Commissioners, 182 N.E.2d 577 (Ill. App. 1962)-Holds that substantial evidence did not sustain findings that retention of a police officer who fIled petition for voluntary bankruptcy would place a social stigma on the department and impair reputation and efficiency of the department.

Quinn, 278 S.W. 625 (Ark. 1925)-Holds that dis\u00ad charge for indebtedness is not justified where there was no rule against having debts and no showing of misconduct or failure to perform duties. 12.

Thetford, 529 F.2d 695 (5th Cir. 1976)-Held the discharge of a probation officer for fIling suit against the orders of his superior to be a violation of the officer's constitutional rights to litigate. The court established the test for determining the constitutionality of the order as whether, from an objective standpoint, the exercise of the officer's right disrupts and materially affects the operations of the agency.

The deputy's superior was directed to follow the proper procedures applIcable to dismissals if he desired to terminate the deputy's employment. 2. Voss v. City city offer to remstate lum, followmg suspension based upon sergeant's acceptance of certain conditions, ,:as deemed to be a voluntary letter of resignation. The court found no coercIOn nor any indication of any unlawful action by which the sergeant's resignation was obtained through fear c; threats; the court s~eci~cally cited the letter in which he had stated that ' the proposed reductIOn m rank has not affected my decision\" and that \"1 don't feel I want to do this [work for] now with the ... police department.\" 3. (Ct. Cl. 1975)-Federt em~o~e~ who subjectively perceived the necessity of resigning when con ronte WIt .t, ' 1, :_' 292 APPENDIX B notice of possible forthcoming discharge made a voluntary choice to resign, and the mere apprehension of unpleasantness which would accompany a challenge to the validity of her termination was insufficient to prove that she had submitted her resignation under duress. 4. Valenzuela v. Board of Civil Service Commissioners, 115 Cal. Rptr. 103 (Ct. App. 1974)-Directed the lower court to exercise its independent judgment to determine whether weight of evidence supported Civil Service Commis\u00ad sion's finding that the petitioner's resignation as an employee of the water department was not the product of coercion or duress. 5. Bellamy v. Gates, 200 S.E.2d 533 (Va. 1973)-Officer who elected to resign from police force after having been informed by police chief that a judge had suggested it as one of three alternatives to being discharged from force could not recover damages from either police chief or judge in civil action alleging duress. The police chief was found to be exercising a discretionary function for which he could not be liable, and judges are exempt from liability for official acts. 6. Cacchioli v. Hobennan, 338 N.Y.S.2d 865 (1972)-Held that the threat to fire a probrrtionary police officer if he did not tender his resignation did not constitute duress if the department had the right to discharge him. If the only basis for seeking the resignation was that the officer had previously been adjudged a youthful offender, the court would order his reinstatement on the ground that the resignation was coerced. 7. Crouch v. Civil Service Commission, 459 S.W.2d 491 (Tex. 1970)-Held that the resignation of a police\u00b7 officer after he had been suspended for entering a building and stealing several transistor radios was voluntary, since there was ample evidence to support the contention that the officer's resignation was prompted by his desire to finalize the matter at the earliest possible time so that he might obtain other employment. 8.

Ct. 1953)-Held that where a noncitizen fraudulently secured the position of police officer by using a borrowed birth certificate, the petitioner's resignation under threat of dis\u00ad missal was not made under duress. Selected Cases on Police Discipline 293 10. WiIlbourn v. Deans, 240 S.W.2d 791 (Tex. 1951)-Ruled that there was insufficient evidence to establish that former sheriff was forced to resign. The only threats communicated to him were that if he refused to resign, legal proceedjpgs would be brought to remove him from oflJce. These threats did not constitute duress, since a threat to do what one has a legal right to do, such as bringing suit in court to enforce a cluimed civil right, cannot constitute duress. 11. Fox v. P.2cl. 763 (Utah 1951)-Ruled that plaintiff's resigna\u00ad tion from the fire department was not obtained by duress. The court held that the fact that the fire chief told the plaintiff that unless he resigned he would be discharged and that the discharge would be accompanied by ad\u00ad ver~e publicity was insufficient evidwce to show that the fireman's resigna\u00ad tion was involuntary. The court ruled that the fire chiefs conduct amounted to the giving of advice and that \"persuasion or advice does not constitute duress.\" 12. Varela v. Board of Commissioners, 238 P.2d 62 (Cal. App. 1951)-Held that a police sergeant who reSigned under the threat of being prosecuted for the crime of accepting a bribe, of which he was innocent, had the right to seek reinstatement to the police force, provided that he acted with reason\u00ad able promptness and diligence in pursuing his claim. 13. Moreno v. Cairns, 127 P.2d 914 (Cal. 1942)-Held that the section of the Los Angeles City Charter requiring any public employee claiming that he had been unlawfully suspended, laid off or discharged to file within 90 days a written demand for reinstatement with the Civil Service Commission includes those asserting that their resignations had been coerced. Thus the court refused to reinstate an assbtant fire commissioner who fIled his rein\u00ad statement petition a year after his reSignation. The plaintiff claimed that he resigned rather than be summarily discharged alld incur the attendant loss of pension rights. 14. SEE ALSO: Battle v. Mulholland (Illicit Relations) GAMBLING 1.

In re Baker's Appeal, 185 A.2d 521 (Pa. 1962)-Held that the Civil Service Commission did not abuse its discretion in discharging a police lieutenant, who had on three occasions visited an illegal gambling club. 4. Campbell v. Hot Springs, 341 S.W.2d 225 (Ark. 1960)-Held that the dis\u00ad missal of an officer from the police force was authorized where that officer openly admitted working in a gambling house in his off-time. 5.

Heckt (Dereliction) HAIRSTYLES 1. Quinn v. Muscare, 425 U.S. 560 (1976)-Upheld fire department regu\u00ad lations barring all facial hair except neatly trimmed mustaches, on the basis of Kelley, infra. The court did not rule on whether due process requires a presuspension hearing, because the department had revised its procedures to provide such hearings. 2. Kelley v. Johnson, 425 U.S. 238 (1976)-Holds that hairstyle regula\u00ad tions do not deprive police officers of Fourteenth Amendment rights. Officers challenging hairstyle regulations must show that there is no rational relationship between the regulations and the promotion of safety of persons and property. The overall need for discipline, esprit de corps, and uni\u00ad formity defeated officer's challenge based on liberty guaranty of the Fourteenth Amendment. 3. Hyatt v. Montgomery County-COral Opinion) (D. Md. 1975)-Holds a county police grooming 0rder inv,alid because of its vague and subjective standards but not necessarily invalid if carefully drawn. 4.

District of Columbia, 392 F. Supp. 1012 (D.D.C. 1975)-Holds that a police officer has no right to demand an exemption from department grooming standards on the basis of religious beliefs, and has no right to be assigned to undercover work where he could continue to wear long hair and a beard. 6. Burback v. Goldschmidt, 521 P.2d 5 (Ore. Ct. App. 1974)-Holcis that the need for a neutral and uniform appearance justifies rules limiting police officer hairstyles. 7. Eujel v. Borman, 384 F. Supp. 141 (E.D. Mich. 1974)-Holds that an employer's hairstyle regulation which applies only to males does not violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 absent a showing that it is used to hinder men from getting, enjoying, or keeping jobs. 8. Stradley v. Anderson, 478 F.2d 188 (8th Cir. 1973)-Regulation setting standards of appearance and hairstyle was rational means of maintaining efficiency and discipline of police force and assuring public confidence, and the department's interests thus outweighed the personal preferences of the officer challenging the regUlation. 9. Akridge v. Barres, 321 A.2d 230 (N.J. 1974), cen. dellied, 420 U,S. 966 (1975)-Sustained the validity of police department hairstyle regulations despite the plaintiffs' contentions that the regulations contravened their First Amendment rights to free speech and expression. The court quoted from the decision in Richards v. Thurston, 424 F.2d 1281 (1st Cif. 1971): \"However, we reject the notion that plaintiffs hair length is of a suffiCiently communicative character to warrant the protection of the First Amend\u00ad ment. That protection extends to a broad panoply of methods of expres\u00ad sion, but as the nonverbal becomes less distinct, the justification for the substantial protections of the First Amendment becomes more remote.\" 10, Yarbrough v. City of Jacksonville, 363 F. Supp, 1176 (M.D. Fla. 1973)\u00ad Upheld plaintiffs dismissal from the Jacksonville Fire Department on the ground of insubordination for refusing to obey an order to cut his hair and trim his sideburns in order to meet departmental grooming regulations. In upholding the departmental regulation, the federal court held that \"this court is unwilling to interfere with the reasonable conclusions of the respon\u00ad sible officers in the Fire Protection Division that there is a rational relation\u00ad ship between longer hair and personal safety of its firemen .... The second basis for this court's conclusion that the hair regulation sub judice does not encroach upon constitutional freedom of expression is the firm conviction ; 1 G<,.,... ... -.:;<\"~--==--'\"\"\"\" i ~, '\" 296 APPENDIX B that it is not the function of the judiciary to interfere with a fire chiefs reasonable notion as to what is necessary to maintain discipline within a 'quasi-military' organization.\" 11. Rinehard v. Brewer, 360 F. Supp. 105 (S.D. Iowa 1973)-Held that prison hair regulation for inmates was reasonable on two grounds: 1) need for instant identification, and 2) health and safety. 12. Cupit v. Baton Rouge Police Department, 277 So.2d 454 (La. 1973)\u00ad Upholds the dismissal of plaintiffs from the Baton Rouge Police Depart\u00ad ment for refusing to comply with departmental hair regulation despite the fact that the plaintiffs' religious beliefs precluded them from shaving. The court noted that the plaintiffs conceded that as long as the regulation bore a reasonable relationship to the efficient operation of the department, the regulation would not be an unconstitutional restraint on their freedom of \u00b7religion. 13. Greenwald v. Frank, 337 N.Y.S.2d 225 (App. Div. 1972)-Polict' Depart- ment hairstyle rule upheld. 14. Olsyewski v. Council of Hempstead Fire Department, 334 N.Y.S.2d 504 (Sup. Ct. 1972)-Upheld discharge of fireman for refusing to shave I:is goatee. The regulation was held to be reasonable on the grounds that faCIal hair would detrimentally affect a fireman's ability to use his equipment. 15. Schneider v. Ohio Youth Commission, 287 N.E.2d 633 (Ohio Ct. App. 1972)-Affirmed the suspension of a social worker for refusing to trim his hair. However, unless there is specifically shown to be such an expression of philosophy, idealism or point of view through a style of one's hair, no pro\u00ad tection under the First Amendment may successfully be claimed. No such showing was present in this case. 16. Garrett v. City of Troy, 341 F. Supp. 633 (E.D. Mich. 1972), afi'd 473 F.2d 912 (1973)-Sustained the discharge of a city employee, an engineer\u00ad ing assistant, for wearing a mustache and sideburns. This court found that the city acted on the basis of substantial evidence that plaintiffs appearance drew \u00b7unfavorable comments from the general public and from city employees which interfered with the proper functioning of the city. 17. Lindquist v. Coral Gables, 323 F. Supp. 1161 (S.D. Fla. 1971)-Holds that the regulation of Coral Gables Fire Department prohibiting members from wearing sideburns extending below earlobes is invalid for failure of the city to show any relationship between sideburns and interference with proper functioning of fire department; and member suspended for violating regu\u00ad lation was entitled to reinstatement with full retroactivity of tenure, status and salary. Selected Cases all Police Discipline 297 18. Elko v. McCarey, 315 F. Supp. 886 (E.D. Pa. 1970)-Where fire depart\u00ad ment members had not established any immediate irreparable injury that could not be redressed by utilization of available administrative remedies and judicial review by city service regulations, proceedings in suit under Civil Rights Act for injunctive and declaratory relief with respect to sus\u00ad pension for ten days without pay and threatened further serious disciplil'tafY action for violation of fire commissioner's memorandum regulating length and manner of grooming of Sideburns, chin whiskers and mustaches, would be stayed pending exhaustion of such remedies and judicial review. 19. Lucia v. Duggan, 303 F. Supp. 112 (D. Mass. 1969)-Held that the dismissal of a teacher for wearing a beard, and other charges, as a result of proceed\u00ad ings and on charges of which he was given no notice was a deprivation of the teacher's procedural due process rights. The right of a teacher to wear a beard constitutes an interest which may not be taken away without due process oflaw. 20. Finot v. Pasadena City Board of Education, 58 Cal. Rptr. 520 (Ct. App. 1967)-Action of Board of Education and school district in assigning high school teacher who had taught in classroom to less desirable job of home teaching because he wore a beard in violation of administrative policy or principle, was not arbitrary. capricious, unreasonable, in bad faith, or abuse of statutory discretion. Nor did it violate the Privileges and Immunities or Equal Protection Clauses of the Federal Constitution. ILLICIT RELATIONS 1. Singer v. Civil Service Commission, 530 F.2d 247 (9th Cir. 1976)-The dismissal of a government employee who openly and purposely flaunted his homosexuality, and indicated further continuance of such activities while identifying himself as an employee of a federal agency, was not arbitrary or capricious nor in violation of his First Amendment rights. The court distinguished this case from Norton v. Macy, illfra, by finding Singer's careless display of unorthodox sexual conduct in public to have had a disrupting effect upon the efficiency of the respective agency. 2. Faust v. Police Civil Service Commission, 347 A.2d 765 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1975)-Adultery committed by police officer while off duty, and in private, is grounds for dismissal as \"immorality\" and \"conduct unbecoming an officer.\" Because of the state interest in maintaining public confidence in the police force, an officer who had been \"warned\" of such a relationship APPENDIX B may be dismissed for such adulterous activity; and such dismissal will be upheld on appeal. 3. Safransky v. State Personnel Board, 215 N.W.2d 379 (Wis. 1974)-Holds that homosexual houseparent for mentally retarded teenage boy~ could be discharged where it was shown that he had made advances or remark.~ to other employees and made remarks about dressing up boys in girls clothing. This was a sufficient nexus between homosexuality and job performance to justify the dismissal. 4. Society for Individual Rights v. I'lampton, 63 F.R.D. 399 (N.D. Cal. 1973)\u00ad Holds that U.S. Civil Service Commission cannot exclude persons from government employment solely because they are homosexuals. A person can be discharged for immoral behavior only if such behavior actually im\u00ad pairs the efficiency of the service. 5. Baker v. Hampton, No. 2525-71 (D.D.C., Dec. 21, 1973)-Holds that particular circumstances must be enumerated which ~ould justify dismissal of federal employee on charges relating to homosexual conduct. 6. Acanfora v. Board of Education, 359 F. Supp. 843 (D. Md. 1973), aiI'd, 491 F.2d 498 (4th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 836 (197<t)-Homo\u00ad sexual junior high :5chool teacher could not be refused employment, trans\u00ad ferred to nonteaching duties or dismissed from faculty merely because he was a homosexual. Without some showing that his job performance was affected, or that he had discusseu homosexuality with teachers or students, or that his homosexuality was notorious, the teacher was protected by the right of privacy. Reinstatement was denied because the teacher had attracted national attention. 7. Gayer v. Schlesinger, 490 F.2d 740 (D.C. Cir. 1973)-Holds that security clearance may be withdrawn only if there is a rational connection between the homosexual conduct and national security. Refusal of employee to answer any questions is grounds for revocation of the clearance. Court refused to outlaw all questions related to homosexual conduct, only those overly broad or intimate. 8. Short v. Looney, 324 N.Y.S.2d 309 (I971)-Holds that decision of Appel\u00ad late Division modifying penalty of dismissal of police sergeant to suspension without pay for 15 months for untoward conduct while off duty and in the course of private employment would not be disturbed. 9. Battle v. Mulhoiland, 439 F.2d 321 (5th Cir. 1971)-Holds that in action instituted by Negro police officer who, under MiSSissippi law, could be dismissed from his employment without cause, evidence raised substantial issues of fact as to whether he was discharged, and if so whether his pres\u00ad sured resignation eventuated from his action in permitting two white I I, Selected Cases Oil Police Discip/ille 299 women to board in his home and whether such conduct would materially and substantially impair his usefulness as police officer that precluded sum\u00ad mary judgment for defendants. 10. Norton v, Macy, 417 F.2d 1161 (D.C. Cir. 1969)-Holds that a civil servant could not be discharged because of his homosexuality unless it was rationally related to job performance. Unstable personality, obnoxious over\u00ad tures while on the job, effect on public, and potential for blackmail are aU relevant factors for judgment. 11. Wasemann v. Roman, 168 S.E.2d 548 CW. Va. 1969)-Bolds that where regulations of police department required obedience to laws, and police officer, who was named as defendant in a bastardy proceeding, gave two directly opposite affidavits under oath, one of which was by necessity false, the officer was guilty of false swearing, which constituted a violation of police department regulations and was a proper cause for dismissal. 12. Steward v. Leary, 293 N.Y.S.2d 573 (1968)-Holds that dismissal of a married policeman on the ground that he was living with an unmarried woman, thereby conducting himself in a manner tending to bring adverse criticism on police department, was not so disproportionate to the conduct as to be arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable. 13. Righter v. Civil Service Commission, 136 N.W.2d 718 (Mich. Ct. App. 1965)-Holds that evidence supported findings of failure of good behavior on part of police officer, and that discharge of officer who had been ob\u00ad served visiting single woman at such hours and in such manner as to bring discredit upon police department was not improper or excessive as a matter of law. 14, Dew v. Halaby, 317 F.2d 582 (D.C. Cir. 1963)-Air traffic controller appointed \"subject to investigation\" could be discharged for any reason which could have justified not hiring him in the first place. Employee ad\u00ad mitted homosexual, conduct, although he was now married and had a child, and although psychiatrist testified that adolescent curiosity was the cause of the past homosexual conduct. 15. Riley v. Board of Police Commissioners, 157 A.2d 590 (Conn. 1960)\u00ad Holds that where policeman, following his appearance before City Board of Police Commissionc.rs concerning his relationship with 16-year-old girl, was ordered w refrain from seeing, talking to, or associating with the girl, and was warned that failure to obey the order would be considered insubor\u00ad dination, Board's action in subsequently demoting policeman from rank of sergeant to patrolman for failure to obey the order was warranted. When the policeman continued his association with the girl following his demo\u00ad tion, the Board was warranted in finding his conduct constituted sufficient cause for dismissal. Ii It Lee, 149 N.E.2d 193 (Ill. App. 1958)-Holds that the findings of the Commission that patrolman was guilty of conduct unbecoming a police officer and of immoral conduct were not against the manifest weight of the evidence that the patrolman was illicitly involved with a 15-year-old girl. 17. Bancroft v. Usher, 165 N.Y.S.2d 187 (App. Div.1957)-Holds that dismissal of village patrolman n:ther than suspension for 20 days or reprimand was abuse of discretion, where the customary and sanctioned practice was for the operator of a patrol car to take women and children home if they needed transportation and patrolman engaged in no improper conduct and merely permitted a girl under age 21 to remain in the patrol car for a longer period of time than was necessary to take her directly home. 18. Mayor of Beverly v. First District Court, 97 N.E.2d 181 (Mass. 1951)\u00ad Holds that District Court improperly ruled that evidence before mayor and Civil Service Commission in support of charge that police officer was guilty of conduct unbecoming to an officer, in that officer had sexual intercourse with a married Woman who was not his wife, was unworthy of belief and that the result reached by the Mayor and Commission appeared not to be based upon exercise of unbiased and reasonable judgment. 19. Brewer v. City of Ashland, 86 S.W.2d 669 (Ky. 1935)-Holds that married police officer having child by woman other than his wife was legally dis\u00ad missed by city as being guilty of conduct rendering him unfit for employ\u00ad ment by city. 20.

If, as here, they merely charge that he is incapable of performing the functions of his rank, the proper form of discipline is demotion. 7. SEE ALSO: McDonald v. Dallas (procedure-J) Thompson v. Lent (Firearms) B. Incompetence-physical 1. Meith 418 F.S!IPP. 1169 (M.D. Ala. 1976)-Found 5'9\" 160-pou~d height and weight requirements set for job of state trooper no; to be ratIOnally related to the achievement of any legitimate state interest. The court found that body height and weight have some relationship to strength, but was unconvinced that a person below an arbitrarily defined level would invariably lack the necessary strength to perform the required tasks of state trooper. 2. Mass~chusetts Board of Retirement v. Murgia; 427 U.S. 307 (I976)-Upheld the TIght of a state to set a mandatory retiremen t age for police officers. The 302 APPENDIX B Court held that the mandatory retirement rule rationally furthers the state's purpose of protecting the public by assuring physical preparedness of its uniformed officials. Since physical ability usually declines with age, the mandatory cutoff removes those whose fitness presumably has diminished. 3. Lockman v. Van Vorris, 374 N.Y.S.2d 778 (App. Div. 1975)-Upheld the termination of police officer's employment within a year after certification and appointment due to his subsequent failure to meet viSual acuity requirements which he would not also have met if the appropriate administrative authorities had not been inept in their duty to make a preliminary determination at the ti: '\"Ie of his appointment. The court held that the civil service commission would not have been able to refuse to recognize the defective appointment in the absence of statutory provisions that prohibited hiring of police officers who did not meet physical requirements and that allowed the department to investigate the qualifica\u00ad tions and background of \"eligibles\" within three years after appointment. 4. Boyd v. Santa Ana, 491 P.2d 830 (Cal. 1971)-Holds that where a police officer's disability arises out of and in the course of his duties, a city may not deprive him of valuable disability and retirement benefits by discharging him. 5. Dobbins v. Los Angeles, 89 Cal. Rptr. 758 eCt. App. 1970)-Holds that a policeman can properly be discharged because of a physical disability caused by an off-duty injury, notwithstanding that standards of physical fitness were not written into the applicable regulations. 6. O'Neal v. San Francisco, 77 Cal. Rptr. 855 (CL App. 1970)-Ho\\ds t~at where officer had acquired a history of \"grand mal\" epileptic seizures which have affected his on-duty performance, sufficient cause for dismissal because of physical disability is present. 7. Barber v. Retirement Board, 95 Cal. Rptr. 657 (Ct. App. 1971)-Holds that where no position is available that a fireman, disabled in the performance of his duty, is capable of occupying, ordering his involuntary retirement is not an abuse of discretion. 8. State v. Cantrell, 203 S.E.2d 493 (Ga. 1974)-Holds that where statute provides that before a civil service employee can be retired for medical reasons he must receive a medical examination, involuntary retirement of an employee without such an examination is invalid. 9. Otero v. New Mexico State Police Board, 495 P.2d 374 (N.M. 1972)-Holds that action by the State Police Board in dismissing a patrolman for a physical disability (diabetes) must be affirmed by the district court on Selec.led Cases on Police Discipline 303 appeal if supported by substantial evidence. Here, the evidence was sub~tan\u00ad tial and the dismissal was affirmed. 10. Tafoya v. New Mexico State Police Board, 472 P.2d 973 (N.M. 1970)\u00ad Holds that dismissal of a state police officer for failure to pass a medical examination is removal for incompetence. Therefore, in dismissing him, the State Police Board must comply with procedural requirements of a state statute regulating removal for incompetence. 11. 10hnson v. State Department of Institutions, 198 So.2d 159 (La. App. 1967)-Holds that where a civil service employee is demoted on the recom\u00ad mendation of doctors that he is physically unable to handle his present position, the employee bears the burden of proving that his dismissal was arbitrary and capricious. 12. Hamaker v. Gagnon, 297 A.2d 351 (R.I. 1972)-Holds that where a civil service clerk-typist, disabled from performing her job by an injury, is transferred to a position she is physically able to perform, her failure to perform her new work in a reasonable time and with due diligence is grounds for her dismissal. C. Incompetence-mental 1. Peterson v. Department of Natural Resources, 219 N.W.2d 34 (Mich. 1974)-Holds that public employees may not be subjected to psychiatric examination unless the examination is work-related and thorough, a copy of the report is given to the employee, and the doctor is available for ques\u00ad tioning by the employee and his lawyer. 2. Semerad v. City of Schenectady, 276 N.Y.S.2d 357 (App. Div. 1967)\u00ad Holds that where a policeman's revolver discharged during an altercation with his wife, at which time the policeman suffered a complete lapse of memory regarding the incident, the city manager had adequate evidence to conclude that the policeman is emotionally unfit for police duty. 3. Carr v. New Orleans Police Department, 144 So.2d 452 (La. App. 1962)\u00ad Holds that a police officer who suffers mental disorder while so employed is subject to discharge by the appointing authority if the disorder renders him unfit or unable to discharge his duties properly. 4. Lantini v. Daniels, 247 A.2d 298 (R.!. 1968)-Holds that where a police\u00ad man, injured while on duty, is found competent to return to work and is ordered to return, his refusal to report justified his dismissal. Where quali\u00ad fied doctors disagree on the officer's medical or mental condition, a hearing 304 APPENDIX B board has the right to weigh the evidence and accept or reject the testimony of either medical expert. D. Incompetence-probationary officers 1. Tabone v. Codd, 387 N.Y.S.2d 122 (App. Div. 1976)-Upheld termination of probationary police officers, one on the basis that police commissioner's evaluation of his scholastic career at the academy warranted the conclusion that his attitude was immature and irresponsible, and the other on the basis of medical information in his file that he did not appear to be a good prospect for police employment. Since the termination of the officers' employment did not impugn their good names, or impose stigmas which would foreclose their freedom to take advantage of other opportunities, they were not entitled to hearings prior to termination. 2. Connaster v. City of Knoxville (Tenn. Ch. Ct. 1975)-Upholds the dismissal of probationary officers who failed to pass a psychological examination. Although no hearing was required, the employees were entitled to a copy of the psychologist's reports and to place evaluations from their own psycholo\u00ad gist in their personnel files. 3. Clark v. City of Manchester, 305 A.2d 668 (N.H. 1973)-Holds that a pro\u00ad bationary officer can be discharged without written reasons for unfitness caused by an off-duty injury. The period within which the probationary officer is out of service with the injury does not count toward the comple\u00ad tion of his probationary period. 4. Application of Going, 170 N.Y.S.2d 234 (Sup. Ct. 1958)-Holds that a probationary patrolman can be dismissed at the end of his probationary period without a hearing. Statutory power of the civil service commission to dismiss a probationary employee during the probationary period is concur\u00ad rent with the statutory power of the police commissioner to dismiss at the. end of the probationary period. 5. Hanson v. Kennedy, 163 N'y.S.2d 301 (Sup. Ct. 1957)-Holds that where the police commissioner relies on the recommendation of the Examining Committee of Police Surgeons in dismissing a probationary officer because of a physical defect, the dismissal is not unreasonable even though the officer presents contrary medical testimony. 6. People ex reI. Bhllinger v. O'Conner, 142 N.E.2d 144 (Ill. App. 1957)\u00ad Holds that a petition by a probationary officer to compel his reinstatement filed a year after his dismissal (for an alleged tubercular condition) is barred by the officer's tardiness in filing suit. It recognizes the right of the police Selected Cases on Police Discipline 305 commissioner to discharge a probationary officer at any time during his probationary period if the officer proves to be physically disabled. E. Incompetence-procedural and related matters 1. Brockman v. Skidmore, 387 N.Y.S.2d 426 (1976)-Where acts of mis\u00ad conduct charged against a police officer were not willfully and intentionally perpetrated, but seemed to be the result of mental illness, a police diSciplinary proceeding was appropriate and the department need not follow the statutory vehicles for injury into mental health issues. 2. Papasidero v. Murphy, 328 N.Y.S.2d 558 (Sup. Ct. 1971)-Holds that where a policeman is discharged without receiving a statement of formal charges to which he is entitled, the discharge is invalid. An attempt to present him with formal charges seven years later is barred by the statute of limitations. 3. McGlasson v. United States, 397 F.2d 303 (Ct. CI. 1968)-Holds that a civil service employee can be involuntarily retired on disability grounds where the decision is based solely on the conclusions of psychiatric and medical examiners and made without a prior adversary hearing. The due process argument was not raised in the opinion. 4. Bouley v. Bradley Beach, 126 A.2d 53 (N.J. App. 1956)-Holds that a statute (providing that an officer, who was retired for disability purposes and who has recovered from the disability, may be reinstated if there is a position available on the force) was held not to contemplate the removal of an officer from the force to make room for the returning pensioner. INSUBORDINATION 1. Shoucair v. Department of Police, 314 So.2d 751 (La~ App. 1975)-Upholds the dismissal of an officer who was forgetful of his duties and deemed his forgetfulness trivial. The officer was originally suspended, but this was changed to dismissal when, upon being informed of his suspension, he became insubordinate, disrespectful and arrogant toward his superior officers. 2. Stephens v.

App. 1961)-Holds that firemen could be suspended for a period of ten days without pay for failure to attend a training session ordered by the fire chief.

New Jersey, 385 U.s. 493 (1967)-Holds that the threat of removal from public office under the forfeiture-of-office statute to induce police officers to rmego the privilege against self-incrimination secured by the Fourteenth Amendment rendered the resulting statements involuntary and inadmissible in state criminal proceedings. 14.

Ill. 1976)-Held that policemen's actions in reporting for duty out of uniform and refusing to I , r~ 310 APPENDIX B work in uniform did not constitute a lawful protest made for purpose of collective bargaining, but instead Was a strike .in violation of a rule that policemen have no constitutionally protected right to strike. 2.

The court found such conduct occurring over a three-day period to be commensurate with a campaign to induce the city to rescind an order whlch had demoted certain high-ranking police officials for budgetary reasons. 3. Vorbeck v. McNeal, 429 U.S. 874 (1976)-A state statute that prohibited police officers from engaging in collective bargaining was upheld on the grounds that there is no constitutional right to engage in collective bargaining. 4.

Lontine v. Van Cleave,483 F.2d 966 (lOth Cir. 1973)-Holds that a deputy sheriffs right to join a union was protected by the First Amendment, and he could not be discharged by the sheriff for exercising a constitutional right. This did not mean that sheriff could be required to bargain or that the legislature could not prohibit strikes. 7. Police Officers Guild, NUPO v. Washington, 369 F. Supp. 543 (D.D.C. 1973)-A statute prohibited police officers from joining any organization claiming the right to strike.

I, Selected Cases on Police Discipline 311 8. Newport News Fire Fighters Association v. Newport News, 339 F. Supp. 13 (E.D. Va. 1972)-Holds that the right to join a union is protected by the First Amendment.

City of Charlotte, 296 F. SUpp. 1068 (W.D.N.C. 1969)-Holds that a state cannot make it a misdemeanor for public employees to join labor unions, including national unions. State may ban strikes, since this would not infringe on First Amendment rights as broadly. Statute voiding all contracts between unions and units of government is valid; only legisla\u00ad ture may require bargaining on the part of government. 13. Mclaughlin v. Tilendis, 398 F.2d 287 (7th Cir. 1968)-Teachers, who were discharged for joining a union, sued for reinstatement.

The undisputed evidence indicated that the police officer had been stabbed in the stomach, and, either immediately thereafter or contemporaneously therewith, had fired a shot that killed the assailant. The court, in finding no violation of the departmental rule on self\u00b7defense, did sustain the evidence that showed the incompetency of the officer for haVing failed to summon appropriate assistance and for having sought the aid of an unarmed private citizen. 3. Fomuto v. Police Board of City of Chicago, 349 N.E.2d 521 (Ill. App. Ct. 1976)-Where an officer was not carrying his 3ervice revolver because its holster strap broke when he went on duty, and he was carrying another. pistol which he was qualified to carry as a second weapon, such a teclmical violation of departmental rule requiring an officer to arm himself with a regularion weapon did not warrant his discharge. 4.

Stribling v. Mailliard, 85 Cal. Rptr. 924 (Ct.

Board of Police Commissioners, 44 A.2d 80 (N.J. 1945)-Holds that a patrolman's work as toolmaker in an outside part-time capacity, in violation of rule of Board of Police Commissioners, removed patrolman from classification of an officer holding office during good behavior and justified the Board in dismissing him. 19. Calfapietra v. Walsh, 49 N .Y.S.2d 829 (Sup. Ct. 1944)-There is a rational relationship between a rule prohibiting outside employrr.ent and the effi\u00ad cient conduct and administration of the fire department. Employee WllO averaged over 100 hours per week working on two jobs, without sufficient time for rest, could not properly and efficiently perform his duties as fireman. 20. Bell v. District Court, 51 N.E.2d 328 (Mass. 1943)-Validity of rule pro\u00ad hibiting outside employment is to be upheld unless it is shown that rule cannot have any rational relation to the maintenance of an efficient fire\u00ad fighting force. 21. Reichelderfer v. Ihrie, 59 F.2d 873 (D.C. Cir. 1932), cert. denied, 287 U.S. 631 (1~32)-Rule prohibiting firemen from holding outside employ\u00ad ment and requiring devotion of full attention to duties is reasonable because of nature of work. Similar rule might not be valid for other types of employees. 22. People ex reI. Rogers v. Tinney, 172 N.Y.S. 355 (1918)-Rule requiring assistant fire department engineers to attend all fires and alarms precludes holding any outside employment which would prevent carrying out that rule, even in the absence of any incident in past. 23.

App. Ct. 1976)-Construed statute providing that \"when\u00ad ever any person who 'shall have received' any benefits from a policemen's pension fund shall be convicted of a felony such policeman shall receive 'no further' pension allowance or benefit\" to apply only to officers who were convicted of felonies after they had already been receiving benefits. The former police officers here had committed service-connected felonies while still assigned to the force and were not at the time collecting pensions. 2. Steigerwart v. St. Petersburg, 316 So.2d 554 (Fla. 1975)-Upheld a city police pension fund regulation which grants a pension to any officer who has twelve years of service and who is discharged for cause, but denies a pension to an officer removed for willful neglect of duty, disobedience, habitual drunkenness, or conviction of a felony. 3. Ballard v. Board of Trustees, 324 N.E.2d 813 (Ind. 1975), appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 806 (1975)-Holds that pensions under state compulsory contribu\u00ad tion plan are gratuities and create no vested rights. Therefore, the discon\u00ad tinuance of payments to a retired police officer convicted of manslaughter was not an unconstitutional taking of property under the legal doctrine that no conviction shall work a forfeiture of estate. 4. Tolan v. Murphy, 333 N.Y.S.2d 296 (1972)-Reversed the dismissal of a police officer for selling, contrary to departmental rules, information con\u00ad cerning criminal records to a private detective agency. The dismissal had resulted in a forfeiture of $150,000 of vested pension rights. The court ruled in placing Tolan on three years' suspension that dismissal is the ultimate punishment, and it is to be invoked only for tlle most egregious misconduct. 5. Smith v. Murphy, 330 N.Y.S.2d 146 (I972)-Held that dismissal and for\u00ad feiture of pension rights are too harsh a punishment for a police officer of twenty-two years who solicited and received unlawful gratuities. 6. Leonard v. City of Seattle, 503 P.2d 741 (Wash. 1972)-Held that criminal misconduct occurring after retirement and receipt of p!,!nsion benefits will not work a forfeiture of one's pension.

Board of Firemen, Policemen, and Fire Alarm Operators Pension i! . . . . t~ S.W.2d 319 (Tex. Civ. App. 1971)-Denied a disability pension for mental depression which was shown to be a product of one's miscon\u00ad duct. 8. Hozer v. State Police and Firemen's Pension Fund, 230 A.2d 508 (N.J. 1967)-Ruled that a pardon will not erase the effect of a criminal conviction so as to make one, heretofore ineligible for a pension, eligible for one. 9. Skaggs v. Los Angeles, 275 P.2d 9 (Cal. 1954)-Held that a criminal convic\u00ad tion alone will not work a forfeiture of pension rights for one who meets all the statutory requirements for a pension. The court adopted the position that when the plaintiff had served twenty years his right to a pension vested and his subsequent misconduct (conviction of receiving a bribe) could not serve as a bar to the receipt of his previously earned pension rights. 10. Rockenfield v. Kuhl, 46 N.W.2d 17 (Iowa 1951)-Held that a felony convic\u00ad tion will only work a forfeiture of pension benefits if the conviction occurs prior to the receipt of pension benefits. 11. McFeely v. Board of Pension Commissioners, 59 A.2d 412 (N.J. 1958)\u00ad Reversed the order rescinding the pension granted to a former Hoboken chief of police on the ground that there were pending indictments against him which rendered his service something less than honorable. The court ruled that indictments alone will not work a forfeiture of pension rights. 12. Pangburn v. Ocean City Police and Firemen's Pension Fund, 56 A.2d 914 (N.J. 1948)-Held that suspensions for misconduct involving violations of departmental rules will not serve to render one's tenure as an officer dis\u00ad honorable. A New Jersey statute required twenty years of honorable service as a condition precedent to the receipt of a pension. 13. Van Coppenolle v. City of Detroit, 21 N.W.2d 903 (Mich. 1946)-Held that one who is already receiving pension payments can lose such benefits for criminal conduct occurring while he was a police officer. 14. State ex reI. Foxall v. Cossairt, 65 N.E.2d 870 (Ohio 1946)-Held that one who persists in contracting debts which one cannot repay is acting dis\u00ad honestly and thus is not entitled to pension benefits when discharged for such misconduct. 15. Delia v. Valentine, 56 N'y.S.2d 505 (l945)-Ruled that the disposition of pending criminal charges is a requirement for the receipt of a pension. 16. State ex reI. Kirby v. Board of Fire Commissioners, 29 A.2d 452 (Conn. 1942)-Held that in the absence of a statutory provision, a pension will not be denied on the basis of a criminal conviction alone.

Retirement Board, 109 P.2d 962 (Cal. 1941)-ls authority for the proposition that an officer who is dismissed for conduct unbecoming an officer, disobedience of specific orders, and insubordination, is not entitled to a pension despite the fact that he has reached the retirement age with the necessary years of service. 18. WaIter v. Police and Fire Pension Commission, 198 A. 383 (N.J. 1938)\u00ad Ruled that a felony conviction will work an automatic forfeiture of pension rights. Walter applied for a pension two years after his position as a police officer was automatically forfeited by force of a statute when he was con\u00ad victed on a felony indictment charging him with malfeasance in office. The New Jersey statute required an individual to be a member of the police department at the time of his application for a pension. 19. Plunkett v. Board of Commissioners, 173 A. 923 (N.J. 1934)-The court took the position that the requirement of honorable service must be met during the entire period of one's tenure as a fireman. Plunkett was dismissed from the Hoboken Fire DejJ,~itment after twenty-nine years of service for embezzlement of funds from the Firemen's Relief Association. The statu\u00ad tory requirements for a p('Psio:) \\,>ere fifty years of age with twenty years of honorable service. 20. Fromm v.

St. Paul Police Relief Ass'n, 236 N.W.2d 170 (Minn. 1975)-Held that in absence of specific legislative authority or any provision in articles of police relief association allowing refund to officers of their contributions, officers were not entitled to refund when tlley left employment prior to becoming eligible for benefits. Court based support for finding on lack of any contractual provision for\"lefunds and decisions of other jurisdictions uniformly denying refunds under similar circuIllstances. Citing Derby, illira, and McFeely, infra, it held there could be no claim of the fund's unjust , \" 322 APPENDIX B enrichment because in return for contributions one has had the benefit and protection of the pension system during the period he is contributing. 2. Conrad v. City of Thornton, 553 P.2d 822 (Colo. 1976)-Held that state statutes restricting use of pension funds do not prohibit a home rule city from contracting with its firemen and policemen to refund their individual contributions upon termination of employment prior to qualification for pension benefits. 3. Policemen's and Firemen's Retirement Fund v. Shields, 521 S.W.2d 82 (Ky. Ct. App. 1975)-Under a statute which permitted the refund of pension contributions upon withdrawal or retirement from service, a police officer dismissed for misconduct was entitled to regain his mandatory contributions to a pension fund. 4. Billings v. City of Orlando, 287 So.2d 316 (Fla. 1973)-Held a refund of only 50 percent of the amounts deducted from their salaries as pension fund contributions did not deny the officers equal protection of law and was not a denial of due process, since the only property rights to pensions are statutory. 5. Gould v. EI Paso, 440 S.W.2d 696 (Tex. 1969)-Held that a fireman who voluntarily terminated his employment with the EI Paso Fire Department cannot obtain a refund of pension contributions where the statute is silent on the issue of refunds. 6. Derby v. Police Pensiqn & Relief Board, 412 P.2d 897 (Colo. 1966)-Held that police officers whose service had been terminated for either voluntary or involuntary reasons prior to becoming eligible for the receipt of their pensions could not get a refund of pension payment contributions. 7. Reagan v. Board of Firemen, Policemen, and Fire Alarm Operators Pension Fund, 307 S.W.2d 958 (Tex. 1957)-Held that a police officer cannot receive a refund of pension contributions where the relevant pension statute does not make provisions for such a refund. The court ruled that refunds are denied where (as in the case at bar) the officer was dismissed for cause. 8. Bowen v. Board of Trustees, 76 So.2d 43 (La. App. 1954)-Held, where at the time a police officer joined the force only sixteen years of active ser\u00ad vice were required to become eligible for pensipn rights, but the length of service was subsequently raised to twenty (20) years the officer was not entitled to such pension after sixteen years, nor to any refund of any con\u00ad tributions to such retirement fund. The right to pension is fixed as of the time of eligibility, and until it is earned the right to a pension is inchoate and may be modified by subsequent legislation. 9. McFeely v. Pension Commission, 73 A.2d 757 (N.I. 1950)-Held that absent Selected Cases Oil Police Dib'cipline 323 statutory authorization, a police officer cannot receive a refund of pension fund contributions. 10.

Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347 (1976)-Held that, under the First and Four\u00ad teenth Amendments, Republican employees of sheriffs department could not be dismissed from non-civil service positions because they were not members of the incumbent sheriff's political party or otherwise affiliated with the Democratic Party. The Court stated that limiting patronage dismis\u00ad sals to policymaking positions is sufficient to prevent the goals of the in\u00ad party from being thwarted. 3. Magill v. Lynch, 400 F. Supp. 84 (D.R.I. 1975)-Holds that municipal fire\u00ad men may run in a nonpartisan election as candidates for the offices of mayor and city councilman. 4. Perry v.

O'Hara v. Commissioner of Public Safety, 326 N.E.2d 308 (Mass. 1975)\u00ad Officer was suspended without pay when he filed for candidacy and again when he was elected. Court upheld department's rule governing political activity. Rule was justified by conflict of interest that might be created because canqidate-police officers might not fully enforce the law. 6. Boston Police Patrol Association v. City of Boston, 326 N.E.2d 314 (Mass. 1975)-Department can require officers who become political candidates to take leave without pay. 7. Phillips v. City of Flint, 225 N.W.2d 780 (Mich. Ct. App. 1975)-Held that two city charter provisions which prohibited city employees from engaging in certain types of political activity were unconstitutionally overbroad. 324 APPENDIX B 8. Commonwealth ex reI. Specter v. Moak, 307 A.2d 884 (Pa. 1973)-City charter required city employees to resign prior to becoming candidate for office. Court upheld charter under compelling state interest test on the grounds that candidates would use their jobs to intimidate other employees and would neglect work while campaigning. 9. Lecci v. Calm, 360 F. Supp. 759 (E.D.N.Y. 1973)-Police union sued to overturn law prohibiting police officers from contributing to or joining political organizations. Court found the law to be overly broad since it did not limit the prohibition to partisan politics. The court also said that Mitchell, infra, was not controlling because of the abolition of the right\u00ad privilege doctrine and use of the compelling interest test. 10. United States Civil Service Commission v. National Association of Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. 548 (1973)-The Supreme Court reaffirmed the Hatch Act and Mitchell, til/ra, without reaching the compelling state interest ques\u00ad tion. It relied on the finding that the statute was not overly broad because of ninety years of interpretation as to the exact meaning of the restrictions. The Hatch Act is specifically limited to partisan activities. No mention was made of the possible alternatives to an absolute ban, which was a crucial point in many of the lower court decisions prior to this one which found similar state laws unconstitutional. Among the government policies support\u00ad ing the Act were: fear of favoritism in hiring and promotion, fear of the building up of political machines, fear of an appearance of partiality in dealing with the public, and a desire to promote impartial execution of the laws. II. Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601 (1973)-lJpholds the constitutionality of a state's \"Little Hatch Act\" on the grounds that it was not substantially overbroad and was constitutiona1 as applied. The law under attack was simiiar to the Hatch Act provisions in NALC, supra. The conduct of the employees challenging the statute was patently within the scope of the prohibited activities, so they could not properly challenge the whole statute. 12. Mancusso v. Taft, 341 F. Supp. Cir. 1973)-City charter required dty employees to resign or be discharged upon becoming a candidate for offlce. Court said the charter provision did not satisfy a compelling state interest and it violated the Equal Protection Clause. The need for efficient ane! impartial civil service could be met through conflict of interest laws, punishment of actual misconduct or abuse of position, and granting leaves of absence. Statute should also specify which offices were covered, since the charter prohibited running for any office in any state. Suit was brought by a police officer. ------------ Selected Cases on Police Discipline 325 13. Kaufman v. Pannuccio, 295 A.2d 639 (N.J. 1972)-Police lieutenant was elected to the city council. A taxpayer filed suit challenging his right to sit on the council. Court ruled that the common law doctrine of incompati\u00ad bility required lieutenant to give up one job or the other. Incompatibility exists where one person holds two positions, one of which is subordinate to the other. In this case, the city council set police wages and decided on matters of tenure and promotion in the department. 14. Gray v. City of Toledo, 323 F. Supp. 1281 (N.D. Ohio 1971)-A statute and police department rules prohibited giving or receiving political contribu\u00ad tions, holding party office, running for office, or making speeches. Court found the statute too broad, since it was not limited to partisan political activity. Nonpartisan political activity is protected by the First Amendment. 15. Hobbs v. Thompson, 448 F.2d 456 (5th Cir. 1971)-Firemen were ordered to remove bumper stickers from their cars under rule prohibiting public employees from becoming involved in politics. Court found the statute overly broad, felt it would inhibit employees in the exercise of protected speech. There was no relationship between bumper stickers and efficiency of the department. 16. Johnson v. State Civil Service Commission, 157 N.W.2d 747 (Minn. 1968)\u00ad Motor vehicle clerk, who filed as a candidate for court clerk in a city 100 miles away, was discharged. Statute permitted state employees to run for unpaid offices only. Court upheld the statute because of the evils of the spoils system, influence peddling, and failure to devote full attention to duties which would result. After the suit was begun the legislature amended the law to allow one-year leaves of absence and running for offices paying less than $600.00 per year. 17. Minielly v. State, 411 P.2d 69 (Ore. 1966)-Deputy sheriff challenged statute requiring him to resign prior to becoming a candidate for office, in this case for sheriff. Court ruled statute unconstitutional because it was too broad to satisfy the compelling state interest test. However, the court said that narrowly drawn statutes prohibiting government employees from running against their superiors would be upheld. 18. United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75 (1947)-Federal statute prohibited participating in political management or political campaigns, other than by voting or expressing opinions. A party committeeman who was fired sued for reinstatement. Supreme Court upheld the statute, since only partisan political activity was prohibited. Court reaffirmed Curtis, infra, and noted fears of favoritism and building of political \"machines\" within government agencies. 326 APPENDIX B 19. Ex parte Curtis, 106 U.S. 371 (1882)-This case is the first major civil service-politics case. A federal statute prohibited soliciting or accepting political contributions from other federal employees; violation was a misde\u00ad meanor. Curtis was convicted. Supreme Court upheld the statute, noting that it preserved the efficiency and integrity of the service and the impar\u00ad tiality and independence of employees. It also noted that only contributions among government employees were forbidden, not outside contributions. 20. SEE ALSO: Kilburn v. ColweIl (Bribery) Murchiafava v.

City of Abilene, 508 S.W.2d 592 (Tex. 1974)-Dismissal of fireman for failure to take lie detector test was held to be an unauthorized exercise of authority. The subject of the ordered examination related to the fireman's arrest for receiving stolen property. The court held that the fire chief who issued the order had \"no roving commission to detect crime or to enforce the criminal law,\" and that he could not compel the tenured employee to submit to a polygraph examination when the charged crime bore no relation to the performance of his duties as a fireman or to his accounting for his public trust. 2. Chambliss v. Board of Fire and Police Commissioners, 312 N.E.2d 842 (Ill. App. 1974)-Holds that a polyg~aphist is a competent witness at an adminis\u00ad trative hearing where he is a certified operator who administered the test under proper conditions. 3. Richardson v. City of Pasadena, 500 S.W.2d 175 (Tex. Civ. App. 1973)\u00ad Trial court, as affirmed by Court of Appeals, held that a police officer is guilty of insubordination in refusing a direct order to submit to a polygraph examination during a departmental investigation when reasonable cause exists to believe that the police officer so ordered can supply relevant information. The Texas Supreme Court, however, reversed the dismissal on other grounds (see Procedure -C), declining to rule on the polygraph issue. 4. Engel v. Township of Woodbridge, 306 A.2d 485 (N.J. Super. 1973)-Holds that because New Jersey statute prohibiting lie detector tests by employers does not exempt police officers, an officer could not be required to submit to a polygraph test on pain of dismissal. Selected Cases on Police Discipline 327 5. Grabingel' v. Conlisk, 320 F. Supp. 1213 (N.D. Ill. 1970), aiI'd, 455 F.2d 490 (7th Cir. 1972)-Officers who were suspended for fifteen days, in part for refusal to take a polygraph examination without the presence of their attorneys, were not denied any constitutional right to counsel since their responses at the examination could not have been used agaimt them in any later criminal proceedings. 6. Clayton v. New Orleans Police Department, 236 So.2d 548 (La. App. 1970)-Holds that where puliGe officers, who refused to take a polygraph test ordered by their superior as a result of :J homicide involving a victim who knew the policemen, were discharged fl)r violation of department rules relating ~o abiding by instructions issued from authoritative sources and to cooperating with other officers in the performance of their duty, the officers were not denied due process even though they had been advised they were suspects. 7. Roux v. New Orleans Police Department, 223 So.2d 905 (La. App. 1969), cert. denied, 227 So.2d 148 (La. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1008 (1970)-Holds that a police officer who is dismissed on account of his refusal to submit to polygraph test to verify his earlier statements is not denied due process where he is not asked to waive immunity and is in\u00ad formed that he is not a suspect. 8. Molino v. Board of Public Safety, 225 A.2d 805 (Conn. Super. 1966)\u00ad Holds that, in the absence of a rule requiring police officers to submit to a polygraph test, police officers cannot be discharged for refusing to submit to the test under a rule requiring them to be truthful at all times. There was no claim that the officers had not been truthful at all times. 9. Stope v. Civil Service Commission, 172 A.2d 161 (Pa. 1961)-Holds that under city civil service regulation authorizing dismissal by appointing authority of an employee, \"just cause\" did not exist for refusal of police officers to take a polygraph test with regard to checks and cash missing from a business place. 10. Frazee v. Civil Service Board, 338 P.2d 943 (Cal. App. 1959)-Holds that even though polygraph results are inadmissible in court, they have some value in investigative work. Dismissal for refusing to take a polygraph test upheld. 11. McCain v. Sheridan, 324 P.2d 923 (Cal. App. 1958)-Holds that refusal to complete a polygraph exarnin;ltion is grounds for dismissal, since police officer's conduct must be above suspicion. 12. SEE ALSO: Seattle Police Officers Guild v.

Perry Blair, 374 N.Y.S.2d 850 (App. Div. 1975)-Held that probationary police officer was entitled to a hearing in connection with his discharge following an arrest on charge of rape and unlawful imprisonment, since his dismissal was predicated on considerations reaching beyond the scope of his job performance and affected his good name, reputation, honor, and integrity. 2. Matthews v. Frank, 367 N.Y.S.2d 102 (App. Div. 1975)-Ordered police department to remove notation that a police cadet resigned with \"charges pending\" from the cadet's personnel file, because disciplinary board had taken no action regarding complaint against the cadet. Department could enter notation that the cadet resigned while a complaint against him had been referred to board. 3. Velger v. Cawley, 525 F.2d 334 (2d Cif. 1975)-Held that a stigma which foreclosed employment attached to summarily discharged probationary officer, because the officer's personnel file which contained an allegation suggesting a suicide attempt, was made available to prospective employers. Department could change its disclosure procedures to prevent dissemination of derogatory and possibly stigmatizing allegations, unless notice of charges and a hearing were first afforded to dischargee. Otherwise, due process requires that such notice and hearing be offered before dismissal can be effective. 4. Purdy v. Cole, 317 So.2d 820 (Fla. Ct. App. 1975)-Held that probationary officer who was summarily dismissed for a misstatement in his employment application could be discharged without a hearing. However, the officer was entitled to a hearing, but not reinstatement, because the discharge was also based on his failure to disclose exercise of free speech and assembly rights during anti-police demonstration. 5. Casey v. Roudebush, 395 F. Supp. 60 (D. Md. 1975)-Holds that a proba\u00ad tionary police officer is entitled to a hearing on a charge of being intoxi\u00ad cated and asleep while on duty, for the sole purpose of cros~-examining the witnesses against him, but that he is not entitleci to reinstatement. A hearing is req\\Jired because of the possible adverse effect of the dismissal of the officer's attempt to find another job. In the alternative, the depart\u00ad ment may simply expunge the charges from his notice of dismissal and forego a hearing. This would provide sufficient protection from the adverse Selected Cases on Police Discipline 329 effects, since the I1IJW employer would not be informed of the reason for the dismissal. 6. Reeves v. Golar, 357 N.Y.S.2d 86 (App. Div. 1974)-Holds that a proba\u00ad tionary officer is entitled to a hearing where traces of quinine and morphine were found in a urine test, on the ground that the dismissal was not for unsatisfactory work performance, but was for non-work reasons. The hearing was deemed necessary to prevent arbitrary or capricious dismissals. 7. Couper v. Madison Board of Police and Fire Commissioners, 369 F. Supp. 721 (W.D. Wis. 1974)-Where state statutes appear to authorize an appoint\u00ad ment of a police chief which can be terminated only for 'cause,' the statutes confer tenure on those so appointed. The fact that a letter of appointment indicates that the chief of police is subject to one year's probation does not mean his statutorily granted property interest in the position h~s been with\u00ad drawn. Thus, regardless of the terms of the letter of appointment, a chief of police would be entitled to procedural due proce'ss before his employ\u00ad ment could be terminated. 8. Bradford v. Tarrant County Junior College District, 492 F.2d 133 (5th Cir. 1974)-Nontenured college teacher was entitled to direct reinstatement if she could show that her contract was not renewed for exercise of constitu\u00ad tional rights. 9. Louisville Professional Fire Fighters Association v. City of LouisviIle, 508 S.W.2d 42 (Ky. Ct. App. 1974)--Statute allowing appointing authority to dismiss probationary employee 'Without a written statement of reasons is constitutional. The essence of probationary employment is that the em\u00ad ployer have unfettered discretion in deciding whether to retain a proba\u00ad tionary employee. Courts should only question the reasons behind the discharge or demotion if it is a punitive action directed at the employee's exercise of a constitutional right. 10. Md'leiII v. Butz, 480 F.2d 314 (4th Cir. 1973)-Liberty is infringed and pro\u00ad cedural due process is required when government action threatens an employee's (probationary or nonprobationary) good name, reputation, honor or integrity, or if the dismissal imposes a stigma or other disability which forecloses future employment opportunities. 11. Davis v. Winters Independent School District, 359 F. Supp. 1065 (N.D. Tex. 1973)-Nonrenewal of nontenured teacher's contract did not infringe his constitutional rights. Requirements of procedural due process apply only to the deprivation of liberty or property rights under the protection of the :--.... ,..., .. 330 APPENDIX B Fourteenth Amendment and the First Amendment's free speech protection. 12. Clark v. City of Manchester, 305 A.2d 668 (N.H. 1973)-Dismissal of pro\u00ad bationary officer without hearing or statement of reasons did not violate his constitutional rights. Probationary employee is not entitled to due process protection unless a' showing is made that governmental conduct 1) damages his standing in the community, 2) imposes a stigma that will foreclose future employment opportunities in his profession, or 3) violates a constitu\u00ad tional right such as free speec1L 13. Williams v. Civil Service Commission, 307 A.2d 628 (N.J. Super. 1973)\u00ad Probationary public employment cannot justify denial of a hearing in all cases without consideration of individual circumstances. Where employee's re-employment is jeopardized or his standing in community is damaged, or good name, reputation, honor or integrity is threatened, due process requires a hearing. 14. Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593 (1972)-Lack of formal contractual tenure is irrelevant to employee's free speech claim. Government may not deny benefit on basis that infringes constitutional rights. Tenure status is highly relevant to procedural tlue process claim but is not entirely disposi\u00ad tive. Employee may have right to procedural due process in ~bsence of formal tenure if he can show de facto tenure from the circumstances of his e~ployment. 15. Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564 (I972)-Requirements of pro\u00ad cedural due process apply only to deprivation of liberty and property protected by Fourteenth Amendment. Employee's liberty is deprived if government refuses to rehire him under circumstances that bring his good name, reputation, honor or integrity into question or impose a stigma which forecloses future employment opportunities. To have a property interest, employee must have legitimate claim of entitlement to it. 16. Orr v. Trinter, 444 F.2d 128 (6th CiI. 1971)-Constitutionally impermis\u00ad sible reasons for refusal to rehire a teacher requiring procedural due process for untenured teachers are: exercise of rights guaranteed by First Amend\u00ad ment, Self-incrimination Clause of Fifth Amendment, Due Process Clause of Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and Equal Protection Clause of Four\u00ad teenth Amendment. Interest of nontenu~ed teacher in knowing reasons for nOnt~ ~ewal of contract not sufficient to outweigh interest of school board in free and independent action with respect to employment of pro\u00ad bationaryemployees. 17.

Board of Education v. Calderon, 110 Cal. Rptr. 916 (1973), appeal dis\u00ad missed, 419 U.S. 807 (1975)-Held that a probationary public school teacher's prior acquittal- of criminal charge does not preclude his dismissal on the same charge in a subsequent administrative disciplinary hearing. 3. Reeb v. Civil Service Commission, 503 P.2d 629 (Colo. Ct. App. 1972)\u00ad Held that a Civil servant (Le., a supervisor of a school for girls) could not be removed from office for the identical offense for which she was pre\u00ad viously acquitted in a criminal prosecution. 4. Howle v. Personnel Board of Appeals, 176 S.E.2d 663 (Ga. 1970)-Held that the same conduct which served as the predicate for an unsuccessful criminal prosecution can also serve as the basis for the departmental removal of an officer. Howle was dismissed for conduct unbecoming an officer and perSistently failing to pArform his duties. 5. Simpson v. City of Houston, 260 S.W.2d 94 (Tex. 1953)-Stands for the proposition that acquittal in a criminal matter is not conclt:sive i~ or a bar to a subsequent civil proceeding (a police disciplinary hearing). Slmpson, a Houston policeman, was dismissed from the force for accepting a bribe after having been acquitted of a similar charge in a criminal prosecution. 6. Ludolph v. Board of Police Commissioners, 86 P.2d 118 (Cal. App. 1938)\u00ad When police lieutenant's case before the board of police commissioners was continued and lieutenant after conviction in criminal court appeared without objection before the board which heard evidence to assist it in determining penalty to be imposed, police lieutenant could not attack jurisdiction of board on ground that sAc?nd hearing was a new and separate trial for acts occurring after he was under suspension and no longer amen- --.,..! 332 APPENDIX B able to the rules of the department and deprived lieutenant of his office without due process oflaw. ,. 7.

Murphy, 389 N.Y.S.2d 373 (App. Div. 1976)-Held that an administrative agency, in imposing sanctions against errant employees, is free to consider the prior records of those employees in determining punishment to be imposed, and that, therefore, a police commissioner has a right to review the prior record of a patrolman in connection with charges and specifications against him. 2. Jenkins v. Curry, ]8 So.2d 521 (Fla. 1944)-Permitted the introduction of police officer's prior record, which included three suspensions for neglect of duty, conduct unbecoming an officer and drunkenness, into evidence in hearing before the Director of Public Safety to determine whether the officer should be discharged for being intoxicated on duty. 3. Millburn Township v. Civil Service Commission, 16 A.2d 824 (N.J. 1940)\u00ad Held that a prior disciplinary record is not admissible with respect to the guilt or innocence of the officer but is relevant for the purpose of determin\u00ad ing his punishment after his guilt has been determined. 4. Hughes v. Department of Public Safety, 273 N.W. 618 (Minn. 1937)-Held that it is permissible to consider an officer's prior record when the officer is charged with inefficiency.

Ct. 1976)-Held that policeman, though entitled by statute to counsel at an administrative hearing which resulted in his dismissal, did not possess a constitutional right to legal representation at a prior proceeding which was purely investigatory. However, the Court did rule that a person should be entitled to advice from his lawyer concerning his legal rights in administrative investigations where that person's livelihood may depend upon correctness of a spontaneous decision, particularly where he is required to make decisions requiring knowledge of erudite points of law. 2. Steer v. City of Missoula, 547 P.2d 843 (Mont. 1976)-Recognizes the limited, noncriminal nature of hearings before a police commission as to suspension or discharge of an employee and the understandable lack of legal expertise on the part of the commission's members as reasons for not requiring Rules of Criminal Procedure to be imposed on hearings of this type. Police officer's attorney had attempted to preclude the commission's filing of additional charges after the proceedings had been initiated. 3. In re Dewar, 548 P.2d 149 (Mont. 1976)-Held that a police commission's statutory po,,\u00a5er to hear and determine charges brought against municipal police officers, a quasi-judicial function, would be meaningless without a corresponding power to compel testimony (subject to same resilrictions that guide a district court in trial of similar cases). 4. Paytas v. City of Warren Police Department, 248 N.W.2d 561 (Mich. Ct. App. 1976)-Held that uncharged allegations of misconduct may not be considered by a civil service commission when disciplining a fireman or policeman. A letter containing prejudicial background material and inci\u00ad dents arising more than 90 days prior to the formal chalges had been submitted to the commission by a senior inspector as a recommendation for dismissal. 5. Olshock v. Village of Skokie, 401 F. Supp. 1219 (N.D. Ill. 1976)-Striking police officers' constitutional rights were violated when the village fired only those who insisted on their right to counsel at their hearings and refused to sign stipulations admitting that they had disobeyed orders when 334 APPENDIX B they reported for duty out of uniform. The court awarded back pay to the officers less any damages owed to the village. 6. Daniel v. Porter, 391 F. Supp. 1006 (W.D.N.C. 1975)-Ordered a demoted sergeant restored to his rank, because he was denied due process at adminis\u00ad trative hearing. Specifically, .there was no notice of the charges against the sergeant; there was no rrgJlt to subpoena or cross-examine witnesses; the board's decision was not based on the record developed at the hearing; and the board acquitted the sergeant of the charge against him but demoted him because of evidence of other rule violations with which he was never charged. 7. Schadt v. Sardino, 368 N.Y.S.2d 599 (App. Div. 1975)-Reverses the dis\u00ad missal of a police officer accused of brutality solely because he was not given the right to cross-examine other officers who admitted their own guilt and implicated the officer. The others involved received much lighter penalties. The right of cross-examination was necessary since there was absolutely no other evidence against the officer, and he was entitled to know whether his accusers had made a deal for lighter punishment or had any other bias against him. 8. Richardson v. City of Pasadena, 513 S.W.2d 1 (Tex. 1971)-Supreme Court reversed, on procedural due process grounds, lower cuurt affirmance of policeman's dismissal for refusing to take a polygraph test. The only evidence provided at the commission hearing consisted of conflicting testimony from both the policeman and the chief of police. A few days after the hearing had ended, affidavits were received by the commission corroborating the chief of police's testimony. The court held that the ex parte receipt, reading, and use of these affidavits after the close of the hearing and without notice to the policeman and an opportunity to cross examine the new witnesses or to submit rebuttal testimony constituted a violation of his right to procedural due process. (The Court of Appeals, subsequently, upheld reinstatement of officer based on Supreme Court's reversal of his dismissal. 523 S.W.2d 506 (Tex. Civ. App. 1975\u00bb. 9. Deering v.

Fitzgerald v. Cawley, 368 F. Supp. 677 (S.D.N.Y. 1973)-The double jeopardy ban and speedy trial provision of the Constitution are applicable only to criminal proceedings, not to departmental hearings. However, an Selected Cases all Police Discipline 335 officer cannot be compelled to testify at a departmental hearing unless he is assured that his statements will not be used in any criminal proceeding. 11. Kelly v. Sterr, 299 A.2d 390 (N.J. 1973), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 822 (l974)-Held that a departmental hearing to determine whether a state trooper had properly performed his duties was not analogous to a criminal trial, and that therefore the trooper was not entitled to an open hearing nor all the other procedural safeguards afforded a defendant in a criminal trial. 12. Jones v. Civil Service Commission, 489 P.2d 320 (Colo. 1971)-The Civil Service Commission's discharge of an employee could not be successfully challenged on the basis that an admission of the employee, which was made without his having had the benefit of the usual criminal safeguards, was used as evidence at an administrative hearing for violation of a departmental rule. The hearing board's refusal to consider the defense of entrapment was also upheld by the court. 13. Gamble v. Kelley, 409 S.W.2d 374 (Tenn. 1966)-Determined that a city charter gave police officers a right to a hearing and to be personally present or represented by counsel at that hearing. The court also ruled that no evi\u00ad dence could be adduced outside of the hearing. 14. Fichera v. State Personnel Board, 32 CaJ. Rptr. 159 (Ct. App. 1963)-Holds that a State Personnel Board properly adopted the proposed decision of a hearing officer recommending dismissal of state police officers and entered dismissal orders notwithstanding that the Board members had not read or otherwise familiarized themselves with record of proceedings, with phono\u00ad graphically recorded evidence, or with exhibits or documents, and only one Board member had read written arguments submitted by parties. 15.

App. Ct. 1976)-Held that a showing of caust.. k discharge of police officer requires evidence tending to show some substantial shortcoming which renders his continuance in office in some way detrimental to efficiency and discipline of the service, and actions which law and good public policy recognize as good cause for no longer allowing an officer to hold his position. 2. Cusson v. Firemen's & Policemen's Civil Service Commission, 524 S.W.2d 88 (Tex. Civ. App. 1975)-Ruled that substantial evidence supported the discharge of a police officer on charges of failing to carry out a police dispatcher's instructions, filing a false report, committing an unnecessary act of violence against a prisoner, and failing to preserve the peace by allowing another police officer to abuse a prisoner. 3. Heidebur v. Parker, 505 S.W.2d 440 (Mo. 1974)-Helrl that at a hearing to dismiss a police officer for cause the burden of proof rests with the police superintendent.

Duncan, 437 S.W.2d 199 (Ky. 1969)-Ruled that there must be reasonably sufficient evidence to discharge a police officer for cause. 5. Cruz v. San Antonio, 440 S.W.2d 924 (Tex. 1969)-Held that the test in applying the substantial evidence rule is whether the evidence is such that reasonable minds could not have reached the conclusion the administrative tribunal (here the Civil Service Commission) must have reached in order to justify its action. 6.

Murphy, 282 N.Y.S.2d 254 (1967)-Sets forth the New York sub\u00ad stantial evidence rule in a case involving a New York City police officer who was charged with advising another officer to make false statements to inves\u00ad tigative officers. Substantial evidence in such instances requires more than Selected Cases on Police Discipline 337 merely some evidence from unreliable sources. The New York State rule has long been that whether evidence is substantial is to be determined in the light of the record as a whole. 7. City of San Antonio v. Poulos, 403 S.W.2d 168 (Tex. 1966)-Ruled that a trial court is to uphold the order of dismissal if the latter is supported by substantial evidence. 8. Oratowski v.

Jones v. City of Hialeah, 294 So.2d 686 (Fla. Ct. App. 1974)-Although technical rules of evidence do not apply in the same sense before a police disciplinary board as they do in courts, the hearsay rule should not be totally discarded in situations where individuals are threatened with loss of public employment. In this case, the alleged hearsay admitted at the hearing did not constitute prejudicial error. 5. Brown v. Murphy, 348 N.Y.S.2d 777 (App. Div. 1973)-Held that it was im\u00ad proper, during disciplinary proceeding, to admit hearsay evidence regarding laboratory tests indicating that police officer's urine revealed presence of cocaine.

Falls City, 235 N.W.2d 627 (~eb. 197:5)-Held that police officer, who was suspended by the civil service commission, did not meet burden of proving that civil service commissioner, who was present at a meeting which lasted about 1 1/2 hours in the home of the assistant police chief where complaints against the officer were formulated, should have disqualified himself from the case. He was unable to show bias or prejudice needed to overcome the presumption of impartiality. 3. Police Commissioner v. Municipal Court, 332 N.E.2d 901 (Mass. 1975)\u00ad Holds that a police officer charged with a violation of department rules is denied a fair hearing before an impartial hearing officer where the police\u00ad man's attorney represented the hearing officer's wife in an acrimonious divorce proceeding brought by the wife against the hearing officer. AI\u00b7 though no bias or partiality was shown in this car;\u00b7e, the policeman was nevertheless entitled to a new hearing before a di$interested hearing officer. 4. Ferrari v. Melleby, 342 A.2d 537 (N.J. App. 1975)--Ruled that the chief of police be removed as the hearing officer in a discipl:inary action involving the deputy chief.

Barr v. Pine Township Board of Supervisors, 341 A.2d 581 (pa. Cmwlth. 1975)-Ruled that police officer was not denied a fair hearing because only 340 APPENDIX B two of the three county supervisors were present since there was no statu\u00ad tory requirement for a unanimous board. The fact that one supervisor prepared the charges was not prejudicial since the supervisor did not partici\u00ad pate in the investigating or bringing of charges, but he merely drafted the charges at the chief of police's request. 6. Mank v. Granite City, 288 N.E.2d 49 (Ill. App. 1972)-Ruled that the fact that the police chiefs father was sitting on the Board, which had been con\u00ad vened to determine the truth and severity of charges alleged to suffice for police officer's discharge from duty, was alone sufficient to deny the officer a statutorily guaranteed fair and impartial hearing. 7.

Therefore, the employee, a municipal police officer, can be terminated without formal notice or hear\u00ad ing. The officer's good name, reputation, honesty and integrity were not impaired by his dismissal since the city did not make the reasons for his discharge pUblic. 2. Buckalew v. CHy of Grangeville, 540 P.2d 1347 (Idaho 1975)-City charter provided that police chiefs tenure was for specific term.

A corollary to this is that a petitioner is en\u00ad titled to point out to the court anything in the record which is favorable to his position. When the record is incomplete, as was the case here, the court's task becomes impossible and a remand to the administrative board for rehearing and reconsideration of the charges is proper. 2.

City of Mishawaka v. Stewart, 310 N.E.2d 65 (Ind. 1974)-\u00b7Administrative proc~edings need not be conducted with all the procedural safeguards affor:led in judicial proceedings, but should be conducted with the highest level of propriety practicable under the circumstances. The function of a reviewing court is merely to assure that the board did not go below minimal level of due process required, or did not base its opinion on a total lack of legal evidenco. 8. Basketfield v. Police Board, 307 N.E.2d 371 (Ill. 1974)-The proper standard for review of a police board's dismissal of an officer for miscon\u00ad duct is whether the agency decision was contrary to manifest weight of the evidence. Where an officer was discharged by the police board, but the most serious charges 011 which that discharge was based were not sustained on appeal, the matter should be remanded to the police board even though discharge was a possible penalty for the charges sustained. 9. Templin v. City Commission, 187 So.2d 230 (Ala. 1966)-Held that the determination of weight and credibility of evidence on question of whether discharged fireman had violated a civil service rule was a matter for the Personnel Board, and the court's review was thus limited to considering whether the Board's ruling was supported by legal evidence. 10. Taylor v. Civil Service Commission, 178 N.E.2d 200 (Ill. 1969)-Held in affirming the Civil Service Com'11ission's decision removing Taylor for conduct unbecoming an officer that the reviewing court cannot reweigh the evidence. The CQurt can only judge whether the Commission's determina\u00ad tion was contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence. 11. Gasperas v. Board of Fire and Police Commissioners, 235 N.E.2d 359 (Ill. 1968)-Affirmed the judgment of a lower court reversing the dismissal ofa police officer who was charged with conduct unbecoming an officer and insubordination. While the findings and conclusions of an administrative agency on questions of fact are presumed to be prima facie true and correct, a court of review is required to consider the entire record in detennining whether the findings are against the manifest weight of the evidence. The findings of an administrative agency must be supported by substantial evidence. 12. State ex reI. Perry v. City of Seattle, 420 P.2d 704 (Wash. 1966)-Holds that where, in a case of removal from position within classified civil service, appointing power ftled with Civil Service Commission a written statement of reasons for removal, upon charges not utterly frivolous, and where party charged had full opportunity to be heard, and competent evidence was Selecced Cases Oil Police Dlsclplille 355 produced tending to prove the charges, the function of Superior Court on judicial review was simply to determine whether there was sufficient com\u00ad petent evidence to support the conclusion reached by the Commission. 13. Adamek v. Civil Service Commission, 149 N.E.2d 466 (Ill. 1958)-Reversed a lower court ruling overturning a police officer's dismissal for soliciting and receiving a bribe. The court held that the only function of the courts reviewing orders 01 administrative agencies is to consider the record to determine if the findings and orders of the administrative agency are against the manifest weigh t of the evidence. 14. In re Ditko, 123 A.2d 718 (Pa. 1956)-Held that a court can only reverse an administrative body's decision removing a po1ice officer where a court, if the case were tried by a jury, would be required to enter a judgment not\u00ad withstanding the verdict. 15.
