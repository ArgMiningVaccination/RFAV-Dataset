Containing a moderate amount of caffeine, this drink's brain-enhancing benefits are well known. Caffeine helps to motivate by stimulating the production of dopamine, the body's natural \"feel-good\" neurotransmitter, which provides the \"rush\" when doing something enjoyable. As well as caffeine, mate carries two related ingredients: theobromine and theophylline. All three work together to provide the unique stimulating effect of mate. Nutritional Powerhouse Mate is packed with vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, and the beverage contains just about all of the [micronutrients ](http://www4.dr-rath-foundation.org/open_letters/img-nyt0506/micronutrients.htm)needed to sustain life. Among them are Vitamins A, C, B1, B2, B3 and B5 and E, as well as calcium, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, potassium, selenium, sodium, sulfur and zinc. With 11 polyphenols, mate has more [antioxidant](https://medlineplus.gov/antioxidants.html) power than any other tea-based drink.

These are emulsifiers that boost the immune system and which possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Besides its proven usefulness in treating bladder infections, mate also helps modulate the hyperactive immune response that accompanies seasonal allergies.
