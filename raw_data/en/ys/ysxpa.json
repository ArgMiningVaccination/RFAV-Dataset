In that issue theanatomy and physiology of the musculoskeletal system wasreviewed, and the collection of injuries that this system cansuffer were broken into four categories:1. The wear and tear syndromes or \"sprains and strains.\"2. The direct trauma to bones or \"fractures.\"3. The disruption of joints or \"dislocations.\"4. The \"itis\"es or overuse syndromes and inflammatoryconditions.Sprains and strains were also featured in Part I. Part II isdedicated to reviewing direct trauma to bones.The skeleton can be divided into two parts: the axial skeletonor skull, vertebral column, ribs, sternum, and pelvis and theappendicular skeleton or the extremities. In this article weare going to concentrate on the extremities, leaving the axialskeleton for another article.Bones are vital living structures that consist of hard connectivetissue.This tissueis made up of cells embedded in amineralized ground substance and collagen fiber matrix that isimpregnated with calcium phosphate. As a result bones arevery strong, resilient, and durable. However, one of the mostremarkable feats of the skeletal system is its constant renewal3or replacement and\"remodeling\" of bone as the bonesrespond to stresses being placed on them throughout a life-time.This \"feat\" is accomplished by cells found in the fiber matrixcalled osteoclasts and osteoblasts. These cells are responsiblefor the renewing and remodeling of bones. Osteoblasts arebone-forming, constantly laying down new calcium phosphateto repair fractures, replace old bone with new, and strengthenexisting bone in response to stress being placed on it.Osteoclasts, on the other hand, are constantly reabsorbing theexisting bone, but as fast as they reabsorb the bone, osteoblastsare following laying down new bone.This constant reabsorbing and rebuilding of our skeleton allowsit to change in response to stresses and to repair itself as itrecovers from significant injury and fractures. An example ofbone changing in response to stresses is running. If anindividual takes up running as a form of daily exercise, thebones in the lower legs are going to respond to this new andadditional stress (pounding) by laying down new, additionalbone so that the legs become stronger and more able to tolerateand withstand the increased stress being placed on them by theincrease in activity level.When a fracture occurs, the initial healing response to theinjury is to lay down a dense, hard calcium callus in order tostabilize the fracture site;this response occurs within weeks of the injury. The osteoclasts then come along and reabsorbthis callus or lump of calcium and are immediately followedby the osteoblast cells that lay down new, well-organized bone.Eventually, over a period of months, the bone is rebuilt, \"goodas new.\" In point of fact, this bone is new.As a part of the musculoskeletal system, bones not onlyprovide protection to delicate underlying organs but alsoprovide a rigid structure for the muscles to pull against whichallows us to perform tasks or just move around. The fact thatbones are made of calcium as opposed to some other mineralis important because it allows bones to act as calcium reservesto help maintain appropriate blood levels of calcium. Calciumis a very important electrolyte that is utilized in the contractionof skeletal,smooth, and cardiac muscles and in nerveconduction and other essential biochemical pathways.The central area of a bone is the bone marrow whichproduces red blood cells, the various types of white bloodcells, and platelets. Obviously then, with blood cell productiongoing on at their core, bones are very vascular. When broken,bones are going to bleed at the site of the fracture.Bones are surrounded by a protective envelope of connectivetissue called the periosteum. This layer is also very vascularand contains nerves and pain receptors. The pain associatedwith a fracture is caused by the injury and tears to theperiosteum, the swelling of surrounding tissue caused by thebleeding at the fracture site, and the muscle contractions of thesurrounding muscular layers. The spasms or cramps of thesurrounding muscles are the brain's effort to stabilize thefracture site and minimize additional injury.Principles of Pain Associated with Fractures:1. Fractures hurt.What a revelation.Pain is a protective mechanism; pain ,prevents further injury by inhibiting us from attempting touse the injured part of our body.2. Pain is our friend.No, really. Pain allows us to isolate and locate the injury,to get a sense of the extent of the injury, and to monitorhow well the injured area is doing over time.3. Do not treat the pain.Treat the underlying injury. Once the injury is stabilized,the pain will decrease.In order for a fracture to occur, the body has to suffer asignificant amount of direct trauma or force. The amount offorce required to cause a fracture varies with bone structures.The force required can be very large, such as the tons of forceit takes to fracture a healthy femur, or it can be relativelysmall, such as the minimal amount of energy it takes tofracture a healthy ankle. (Ankle fractures can be caused by asimple twist of the ankle while hiking.) Part of traumamanagement is understanding the mechanism of injury andimplied forces. An individual complaining of a broken ankleprobably has an isolated injury that resulted from trivialamounts of force or energy. However, an individual with afractured femur most likely has other significant injuriesbecause of the large amounts of energy needed to fracture thefemur.Never assume that a fracture is an isolated injury.Based on the mechanism of injury and the forces implied,perform a complete patient exam looking for other, potentiallymore serious, related injuries.Signs and Symptoms of a Fracture:There are a variety of diagnostic clues that will help youdecide if the injury has an associated fracture:1. Mechanism of injury: Ask \"what happened?\"Does the mechanism of injury indicate a possible fracture?Was there enough force?2. The chief complaint: Ask \"where does it hurt?\"Did the victim feel anything break, snap, crack, pop, orcrunch?3. Expose the injury site and look at it.It is impossible to make a proper assessment throughmultiple layers of mountaineering gear. Remove enoughclothing and gear to examine the injury.Istherediscoloration,erythema or ecchymosis, swelling,orangulation; or are there wounds, protruding bone ends, orobjects sticking into the skin.4. Palpate the area - (examine the area closely for pointtenderness) - TOUCH ff.As you gently palpate the injury for point tenderness, listenand feel for crepitation and unusual movement. 5.Is there guarding?Is the injured part being cradled or protected? Is thepatient anxious or do they move away from you as you tryto examine the area and palpate the injury.6. Can they use it?Can they move the injured area? Are they willing to useit or walk on it?In wilderness medicine fractures can be placed into twocategories:uncomplicatedandcomplicatedfractures.Uncomplicated fractures are simple, in-line fractures with goodcirculationandsensationandnoassociatedwound.Complicated fractures have any one of the following qualities:angulated, compound or open, associated with a wound, orimpaired or decreased circulation or sensation.PrinciplesofSplinting&ManagingUncomplicated Fractures:The principle of splinting is to immobilize the fracture enoughto minimize movement of the fracture site which will, in turn,decrease the pain; control bleeding at the site; prevent furtherinjury; and help maintain circulation distal to the fracture. 2 JANUARY/FEBRUARY 19974WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER For splints to be effective, they need to be:1. Well-padded:Padding allows the splint to conform to the shape of theextremity and evenly distributes the pressure to immobilizethe 'fracture.2. Warm:The padding used in the splint must be dry to prevent heatloss from the injury.The splint also needs to besurrounded by insulation to keep the area warm.3. Rigid:The splint must be rigid enough to prevent movement ofthe fracture site and to prevent movement of the jointsabove and below the fracture. In the extremities it is bestto immobilize the entire limb; otherwise, the musclesanchored around the fracture site can cause movement ofthe fractured bone ends when the unsplinted portion of theextremity is moved.4. Monitor:Monitor the splint every 15 minutes to guarantee goodcirculation distal to the site of the fracture. Fractures bleedinternally causing the area to continue to swell, even afterthe splint has been applied. Unfortunately, the best madesplints can become too tight and impair circulation. Stopevery 15 minutes and check circulation distal to the site ofthe injury to ascertain that the extremity is warm and hasan adequate blood supply.To confirm the presence ofadequatecirculation,checkpulses,capillaryrefill,sensation, and movement distal to the site of the fracture.Principles of Splinting & Managing ComplicatedFractures:Complicated fractures are:malaligned, angulated, or rotated.compound or open with bones protruding through theskin.associated with a wound over the fracture.associated with impaired circulation distal to the site ofthe fracture.associated with a dislocation.associated with an impaled object.associated with nerve impairment distal to the site ofthe fracture.The most important aspect of long-term fracture care is themaintenanceof circulationintheentireextremity.Circulation distal to the site of the injury is crucial to preventpermanent tissue loss , frostbite, or permanent impairment ofthe extremity's function.There are on,\"takingappropriate \"Body Substance Isolation\" precautions.2. Wound management:Control bleeding with direct pressure or pressure dressings,being careful of protruding bone ends.3. Wound debridement:If the wound isgrossly contaminated or there areprotruding bone endsthat are grossly contaminated, thewound needs to be gently irrigated with a weak Betadinesolution once bleeding has been controlled.4. Deformity correction:Once the bleeding is under control and the wound has beendebrided and irrigated, use gentle \"in-line traction\" deformity distal to the site of the the extremity is in proper anatomical position.5. Impaled objects:Impaled objects should be removed if possible. However,gentle traction-in-line may have to be applied before theobject can be easily extracted. If the object is not going tobe easily removed, leave it and immobilize it in theposition found.Once the fracture is realigned with good distal circulation,splinting principles and procedures are the same as those foruncomplicated fractures.Techniques of Splinting Uncomplicated ExtremityFractures:Upper Extremity:Shoulder/Clavicle/Humerus/ElbowThese four fracture sites are mentioned together because thesplinting technique for each is essentially the same. If theinjury is \"in-line\" i.e. anatomically correct, and there is goodcirculation, sensation, and motion distal to the site of theinjury, the fracture can be easily splinted with a sling andswathe.With the patient's assistance, place the arm in a comfortableposition across the chest with the elbow bent at 90 degrees.Support the forearm with the sling, padding well around theneck and tying off to one side, and immobilize the forearm tothe chest wall with a 6-inch Ace wrap or other wide materialthat incorporates the forearm in it. Do not wrap around thehumerus because this will cause the bone to bend at the site ofthe fracture.If this is the only injury,the patient should beable to walk once splinted.Monitor the fingers every 15minutes to make sure that circulation is maintained. Ifcirculation becomes impaired, recheck and redo the splint. 5 3 JANUARY/FEBRUARY 1M7 WILDERNESS MED1CONE NEWSLETTER Special considerations:A fractured clavicle is one of the most common fractures seenboth in the backcountry or in town. Simply falling forwardand catching yourself on an out-stretched arm can exert enoughforce against the shoulder to fracture the clavicle. Thesefractures are easily diagnosed with mid-clavicular tendernessand usually a palpable deformity. Do not attempt to realignthe deformity.The potential complication with clavicleinjuries is the close proximity of the lungs. When a claviclefractures,it can potentially puncture a lung causing apneumothorax.Monitor respiratory status closely every 15minutes. Check for subcutaneous emphysema and check forshortness of breath. A punctured lung is a rare but importantcomplication of a clavicular fracture that can ultimately resultin a tension pneumothorax.Forearm & Wrist:Forearm and wrist fractures are also managed with a sling andswathe. However, before immobilizing the arm with a sling,a well-padded rigid (coaptation) splint like a SAM splint needsto be applied to the forearm. Make sure you secure the splintat the joints above and below the injury. When splinting theforearm and wrist,it is important to remember that the wristshould be dorsi-flexed 30 degrees and the fingers flexed as ifholding a can of soda. This is the position of comfort for thewrist, and this position will help to maintain circulation to therest of the hand.Lower Extremity:Hip (or proximal end of the femur):Hip fractures are most commonly seen in the geriatricpopulation secondary to a weakening bone structure due toosteoporosis. However, they can occur at any age from directtrauma to the hip.Hip fractures can be diagnosed by thelocalized point tenderness in the hip region, with externalrotation of the affected leg, and the inability to use the leg.The pain of a fractured hip is typically not very severe and isnot associated with muscle spasms in the same area.Suspected hip fractures can be easily treated by placingpadding between the legs and binding the legs together withAce wraps or cravats to comfortably support the fracture.Femur:The largest and strongest bone in the human body, it takes tonsof force to fracture a femur. It is not unusual for there to beother severe injuries associated with a fractured femur. Afemur fracture is almost unmistakable because of the severepain and muscle spasms that occur with the fracture. Oncerecognized, this is an injury that should be managed as soon aspossible.Initial management is to manually stabilize the fracture andpull gentle traction-in-line. The gentle traction, 5 - 10 poundsof tension, will slowly, over a period of 1 - 2 minutes, fatiguethe muscles surrounding the femur and they will relax. As thespasms abate, the pain will dramatically decrease. Oncetraction has been pulled, it is essential to maintain tractionwhile a splint is applied.A traction splint can be improvised from any rigid object thatis 18 - 24 inches longer that the leg, 6 cravats, and two 6-inchAce bandages. The traction splint is attached to the lateral sideof the leg with two ties. The first tie goes around the waistlike a belt to hold the splint to the side of the body and thesecond tie, around the affected leg only and into the groin.This tie will prevent the splint from riding up as traction isapplied. These two ties should anchor the superior end of thesplint.The inferior end of the splint is the work end where traction isapplied and maintained. To accomplish this, first apply anankle hitch to the ankle on the affected leg. There are avariety of ways to improvise an ankle hitch, but, regardless ofwhich is used, the hitch should be well-padded around theankle to minimize the risk of impairing circulation to the foot.One of the simplest to tie is an \"S\" hitch as shown in thediagram. Next, a second loop is fashioned at the end of thesplint; there should be at least 12 inches between the loop onthe end of the splint and the loop created at the base of thefoot by the \"S\" ankle hitch. Traction is then created by usinga \"trucker's\" hitch to approximate the two loops. Mechanicaltraction is applied until it equals the manual traction beingpulled by the assistant.Once the leg is in mechanical traction, the two 6-inch Acewraps should be applied.Starting at the ankle with the firstAce, wrap from the ankle to just above the knee. The secondone should extend from the knee to the groin, covering andencasing the fracture site.These two Ace wraps unify andsupport the splint and apply direct pressure to the fracture sitewhich helps to control internal bleeding.64 JANUARY/FEBRUARY 1997 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER As with any splint,it is essential to monitor circulation,sensation, and motion distal to the site of the injury. Ifcirculation becomes impaired, it may become necessary toremove the Ace wraps temporarily or to re-establish manualtraction. Do this by removing the trucker's hitch and anklehitch (while maintaining manual traction) and massaging thefoot until circulation returns. When circulation has returned,reapply the ankle hitch and mechanical traction.If you are alone with an injured friend, keep them still whilecompleting the patient exam, and then attach the splint, usingthe splint to apply mechanical traction. Do not apply tractionunless you are able to maintain it until the splint-generatedmechanical traction is applied.Knee:Knee injuries are very common. Determining the differencebetween a simple sprain or strain, a ligament injury, or afracture without an X-ray is virtually impossible. Typically allof these injuries are splinted until the patient can get todefinitive care.Knees should be immobilized in the position of comfort. Thisis usually accomplished by bending the knee to 10 - 20degrees of flexion. This position is maintained by first placingpadding behind the knee and then a rigid support along theback of the leg from below the foot to above the hip/buttocks. T COPY AVAILABLE 5Lower Leg & Ankle:These two distinctly different injuries are discussed togetherbecause the splinting technique is the same. As soon as theinjury is isolated, traction-in-line should be pulled at the ankleto straighten out any deformities or angulations and to bringthe foot into proper anatomical position at 90 degrees.Once the lower leg and ankle are in proper position, they needto be affixed in this position with a well-padded, rigid splintthat immobilizes the knee and lower leg (tibia/fibula) andmaintains the ankle joint at 90 degrees.As with any splinting situation there are many adequate waysto get the job done. One of the most effective techniques is touse an ensolite foam pad or a \"Crazy Creek\" chair. As shownin the diagrams these soft materials can be shaped and tied inplace giving excellent support and providing a high insulationquality which will protect the extremity from the cold.Contents of a Wilderness Fracture Kit:In addition to the materials in a wilderness first aid kit thatwould be used to manage blisters, cuts, abrasions, and othercommon backcountry injuries, the following are recommendedfor managing six-inch Ace wraps; 1 SAM splintThe ensolite pad or Crazy Creek Chair would be carried aspart of the general mountaineering equipment, and the longpole for a traction splint can be improvised from a ski pole,canoe paddle, tent pole, or a stick in the woods.It takes very little additional equipment to properly manage afracture in the backcountry. The investment is not in first aidgear, but in time.It takes time and practice to becomeexperienced and efficient at splinting. To gain the skills andconfidence to use them, practice fracture assessment andmanagement techniques with friends. Then, if the day comes,when these skills are needed, the risks are minimized and thebenefits are maximized for your friend and patient. WINTER TRIP ADVICEby Bryan Yeaton, WEMTTie a sweater around your waist, grab an apple, and jaunt offdown the trail.Although you are a prime candidate for aSearch and Rescue mission, most of the time you are going toget lucky and make it out of the woods on your own. Even ifyou twist an ankle or get lost for a night, apart from mildhunger and dehydration, you will most likely live to hikeanother day, presumable somewhat better prepared.At this time of the year, however, when the rain turns tofreezingdrizzle and glazes every step,and the windrelentlessly carves away at your precious shell of heat, suchlazy liberties turn not comfortable but deadly.7 JANUARY/FEBRUARY 1997 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER1 In the old days they called it \"exposure\" as if simply being inthe natural environment was itself dangerous. People who arefamiliar with the outdoors recognize the insidious killer as\"hypothermia.\" Jed Williamson, Editor of Accidents in NorthAmerican Mountaineering, often says that there is no badweather, just weather, and your preparation makes thedifference. As more people take journeys away from motoraccess and the other shackles of the modern world, morepeople will have jobs leading them there. Whether you planto lead an extended wilderness trip for your hiking clubchapter, or a day trip with friends, a little knowledge andattention to detail can help ensure that the winter season willbe as enjoyable and safe as any other, for you and your group.The folks who earn their living from such trips have someadvice for those leading groups into winter for the first time.Joe Lentini, Director of Eastern Mountain Sports ClimbingSchools, stresses the difference between climbing on your ownand guiding a trip.\"As a guide,\" he says, \"I have to takeresponsibility for the client; they can go with (approximately)lighter packs; I take the extra down parka, the backup mittens,the Gore-Tex bivy sack, the rope, and the heat packs. If Iwere on my own, I'd get rid of half of it.\"Marc Chauvin is the Head Guide of the International MountainClimbing School, as well as being responsible for training staffwho will lead clients on anything from introductory ice climbsto expeditions on the worlds highest peaks, Chauvin agreeswith Lentini, but uses a different philosophy to achieve it. \"Ifyou are leading in the winter, plan on dealing with the clientand not the cold.\"Chauvin calls himself a \"lightweightfanatic.\" He says, \"My biggest pet peeve is (the client's) packweight; if you can't put it all on your body at once, then youdon't need it.The extra gloves and hat are okay, but do youreally need and extra parka?\"Chauvin's belief is that cold becomes a problem for tworeasons: either injury, or they can't move. \"A heavy packslows you down and makes you sweat,\" he says, \"and that iswhere you get uncomfortable and cease to have fun.\" Thecomfort items, says Chauvin, are the things to leave behind.\"People have tried to bring makeup or deodorant on a wintertraverse; you just don't need them.\"According to the guides, having proper gear is usually not aproblem for their clients.However, these clients are wellaware, says Marc Chauvin, of the conditions they are goinginto.If you are just getting winter trip leading, there are stillsome basics which should command your attention.The trip-leader's job actually begins well before the day youlace up boots and strap on snowshoes or crampons. Whetheryou are a professional guide or just out with some friends, youneed to know some background information. One of the firstthings to discern is if they are physically able to succeed onthe trip, even for longer trips a shakedown hike. JoeLentini: \"I look at what they have done in the past.\" For themore arduous trips, he feels the leader should have seen theparticipant's skills and endurance first-hand.\" A (Presidential)range traverse is not the place to start your winter experience.We would like to see you on another trip first.\"Mountains and Rivers is a company which runs trips in Alaska,from above the Arctic Circle in the Brooks Range to MountMcKinley. Chris Morris runs Mountains and Rivers, and heagrees with Lentini, \"most folks who want to climb McKinleyhave done their research. We like to see them come withexperience down south, such as Rainier. But the cold (inAlaska) can still catch you off guard.\"Another important area of medical screening, which can be adetailed form filled out before the trip, or garnered from abrief phone conversation. Screening will be covered in-depthin a later article, but briefly, you should look for any unusualcondition, or one with which you are not prepared to deal. Anunderlying condition does not necessarily preclude someonefrom your trip, although it may require adjustment of yourperspective, or the group's goals, which is another good reasonto know of a situation well beforehand. For example, adiabetic is usually able to control and monitor his or herinsulin/sugar balance, but a strenuous trip may disrupt that.The leader needs to ask about how they will monitor in thefield, and how to deal with any emergency which might arise,as well as determining if it may affect the trip agenda. Havethey done a trip like this before, and how did that affect them?How will the cold affect them or their medication? Is thereany special information you as the leader need to know, or anyprocedure you have to perform. Your diabetic participant isthe best source of information he or she has been dealingwith the disease for longer than you have.Another part of medical screeningisgeneralphysicalconditioning.Is someone potentially overextending him orherself? How do you tell?On paper, one thing to look at is height to weight ratio,although there are certainly people who are cardiovascularlycapable, even when appearing somewhat overweight. JoeLentini asks about specific cardiovascular training programs:what is the exercise? how often? How have they performed onsimilar trips?Gear is also critical, especially with people who's abilities youmay not be familiar. Do they understand the layering system?What specifically do they have for gear? Talk to potentialparticipants and find out what they have and how they use it.Most organizations have a required gear list which is sent toparticipants well before the trip. \"Be very careful aboutspecific gear,\" says Joe Lentini; \"When you have faxed themthe gear list and they still show up wearing a cotton turtleneck,that shows a fundamental lack of understanding.\"Okay, so now you're out in the field; how do you ensure thateverything goes smoothly? What are the signs of impendingdoom for your trip?That depends on how you approach itaccording to Marc Chauvin.\"Most of the things I do aresubtle,\" he says.The biggest key, in Chauvin's view, iskeeping people fed and hydrated. \"In harsh conditions, most 6 JANUARY/FEBRUARY 19978WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER people forego eating and drinking; on my trips, dinner is athree-to-four-hour process. Keep fuel burning in their bodies,and you will prevent a lot of problems.\"All the guides agree that you cannot rely on participants toknow whatishappeningtotheir bodiesinthecoldenvironment. According to Dunham Gooding, President of Institute in Bellingham, Washington, believesin constant monitoring. \"Young guides trust the client to dothe right thing, but it takes constant communication on a one-to-one basis. You can't just check in on them in the morning,and again after lunch.You have to talk to them regularly,every day.\"One of the first things the guides look for is someone slowingjust a bit. Gooding says, \"A common sign is people draggingalong, not performing up to their potential;that meanssomething is wrong. You have to find out why food? drink?cold? because it usually will only worsen.\"Joe Lentini likes to walk along beside his clients and talk tothem;if they are having trouble carrying on with theconversation, he says, it is time to slow down. Marc Chauvinlikes to be subtle and creative in solving the paceproblem. He says, \"One time I had two clients, one who wasmuch slower than the other. Since all the cairns (rock pilesabove treeline to mark the trail - Ed) were covered with snow,I had the faster one help me clear off the cairns while the otherkept along at his pace.I don't know if they even noticed thestrategy.\"One decision the guide cannot be afraid to make, is the one toturn back.\"The safety of the client,\" says Chris Morris, \"isparamount. Things like frostbite are unacceptable.\"Realistic goals, according to Dunham Gooding, are a majorfactor for the winter guide; \"You can't expect to achieve whatyou would in the summer.\"Lentini adds, \"I never say to clients, we'll make it to the top.\"Putting the goal of ascent over safety will get you killed. Ifyou don't make it, that's the reality. 79BACK ISSUES AVAILABLEBack issues of the Wilderness Medicine Newsletter areavailable.

Dickison, MD EpidemiologyDrowning is the third most common cause of death' fromunintentional injury in the United States,' and (exceeded onlyby motor vehicle accidents) is the second most common causeof injury-related deathsinchildren and young adults.2Approximately 8000 people in the U.S.A.Though statisticsare not available,itisestimated thatworldwide 150,000 drown annually. The world drowning rateis approximated at 6 per 100,000 population. In the U.S., forevery drowning, five near-drowning victims are hospitalizedfor services ranging from overnight observation to life-support.Of the approximately 3000 children treated annually in hospitalemergency rooms for submersion accidents, 80% are admitted.'It is estimated that 15% of the population has experienced alife-threatening episode in the water.The highest drowning rates are among children under fouryears of age, with a peak occurrence in toddlers. A secondpeak incidence occurs in young adults 15-24 years of age.Drowning rates for black children (4.5/100,000) is almost twicethose for white children (2.6/100,000).2.34'7 Males drown fourtimes more often than females.2.3.4.6 In one 10-year study inWashington state, boys after one year of age had two to eighttimes greater risk of having a significant submersion incidentthan did girls.Additionally, the submersion risk associatedwith being a boy increased with age for both incidence andmortality. The case fatality rate was greater for boys in everyage group.5 It is interesting to note that although pre-schoolchildren of both sexes have the greatest incidence of significantsubmersion incidents, that male adolescents have by far thehighest case fatality rates.'Drownings, not surprisingly, are most common in warmweather, with 50% occurring from June through August?'\"The southern regions of the country have the highest rates andthe northeast the lowest 13 In three states (Arizona, California,and Florida) drownings and complications of near-drowningsare actuallytheleading cause of fatalinjuriesfor pre-schoolers.'The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Department of theArmy, is the largest federal provider of water-based recreationfacilities in the United States. Each year 25 million peoplevisit one of the Corps' 460 lakes and reservoirs. In acollaborative study with the Center for Disease Control (CDC),The Corps compiled data on all 1107 water-related deaths thatoccurred at their facilities from 1986-1990. 30% of these wereadolescents or young adults. More than half of the drowningsoccurred on Saturday or Sunday. Most drownings occurredduring swimming or wading activities (44%) followed byboating activities and fishing from drownings, 302 (62%) occurred outsidedesignated drown in residential pools and accountfor 75% of all pool-related fatalities. Victims older than fivedrown mainly in rivers, lakes, and canals. The US ConsumerProduct Safety Commission (USCPSC) has recommended thatswimming pools be fenced on all four sides. The house shouldnot be one of the sides if it directly accesses the pool.USCPSC recommends that the fence be at least five feet highwith vertical spacing of no more than four inches. The gateshould have a self-closing and self-latching lock. There issubstantial evidence that fencing can be a very effectivemeasure in the prevention of submersion incidences.Frequency of Drowning in Different MediaSalt Water1-2%Bathtubs20% Facts Interest35% of drowned victims occur <10 yards from safety.\" Pre-swim hyperventilation: Bad Idea.'Seizure disorders raise risk 4-5 times.2Bathtub drowning rate 9.5/100,000<1 year old.2Child abuse is involved in > 6% < 5 year old.5-gallon buckets: 24% drownings < 1 year old.\u00b0It should be remembered that any container of liquid intowhich a child can fit is a potential site for drowning. Five-gallon industrial buckets hold particular appeal to the curioustoddler with his cephalad center of gravity and short reachingspan. Unless the bucket tips over, the young child may not beable to extricate himself.Drownings in hot tubs, spas, andwhirlpools have increased as much as tenfold in the last.decade.'\u00b0 Solar pool covers represent another hazard to childrenbecause they give the false appearance of a solid surface whichwill support toys but not the child's body weight.Alarmingly, more than 50% of teenage and adult drowningsare thought to be alcohol related2.5\" Additionally, the roleplayed by adult alcohol consumption in pediatric submersionincidences can never be assessed, but is probably significantlycontributory.PathophvsioloovIn the classic sequence of events, the drowning victim willgo through several stages.The duration of each stage willvary with the victim and environmental circumstances: Struggle in victims who have been resuscitatedand later die will vary, and will depend to a great extent on theduration of survival, theinitialduration of anoxia, thepulmonary affects of any aspirated fluid, and the effects oftherapy including pulmonary oxygen toxicity and barotraumafrom mechanical ventilation. Damage to the alveolar liningcells, the capillary endothelial cells, and the alveolar Type IIcells is almost universal, and appears similar to the changesoccurring in Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)from any other etiology.What type of fluid the victim may have aspirated hasrelatively minor impact on the subsequent clinical ventilatormanagement, but should be included in the history. Waterwhich contains chemicals (hydro-carbon-contaminated, causticcleaning fluids, highly halogenated fluids, soapsuds, alcohols,etc.) will further potentiate pulmonary dysfunction through achemical pneumonitis and destruction of surfactant; these near-drownings have the highest acute and chronic pulmonarymorbidity and mortality.In terms of management, it makes little difference if a victimaspirates salt water or fresh water. Historically, concerns havebeen twofold: hypervolemia (rapid volume expansion fromaspirating a water intoxication, hyponatremia, hemolysis fromaspirating a hypotonic solution). However, animal data hasdemonstrated that aspiration of more than 11 cc/kg of seawater must occur before volume expansion occurs, andaspiration of more than 22 cc/kg must occur before electrolytesare affected.\" It has been determined that accidental drowningvictims seldom aspirate more than 3-4 cc/kgI2 and therefore arenot at high risk for either volume overexpansion or electrolytedisturbances.Indeed,near-drowningvictimsarealmostalwayshypovolemic. They will have increased capillary permeabilityinduced by hypoxia with resultant redistribution of fluid fromintravascular to extravascular spaces. They may haveundergone a cold diuresis or an alcohol diuresis prior to thecirculatory arrest.Albumin may be lost into the pulmonarybed or other tissues, with resultant loss of colloid oncoticpressure in the circulation.To maintain optimal and both cerebral and renal perfusion pressures,pressure-guided fluid resuscitation is an important aspect of theintensive care management for the significantly injured patient. SEQUENCE OF DROWNING submersion-4-4-4-->apnea/spasm--*---swallows waterti STAGE I 2S'H'AG; Haborted aspiration MARCWAPRIL 9S-`97STAGF: IET12wooznxzez MEWSLETFER Salt and fresh water affect the lung in different ways, butthe end results (ventilation-perfusion mismatching, diffusionimpairthent, pulmonary hypertension, stiff lungs, surfactantinsufficiency, impaired immunity, mucociliary dysfunction,etc.) Are the same. The goals for mechanical ventilation andcirculatory support remain the same as well.Management at the SceneIt is discouraging to recognize that once the hypoxic-ischemic injury has taken place, there is little that can be doneto favorably influence the ultimate neurologic outcome.Quickly reestablishing the circulation and an oxygen supply tothe tissues is of the highest priority. When possible, mouth-to-mouth rescue breathing should be initiated immediately and notdelayed until the victim is taken to dry land or secured to abackboard.Until the patient can be further evaluated, cervical spineprecautions are recommended for all victims of submersionincidents. Axial traction is preferable to a cervical immobilizerduring the initial resuscitation. Poorly fitting collars cancompromise the airway and/or jugular venous return.Great care must be taken not to increase the probability ofaspiration. More than half of submersion victims vomit duringresuscitation. Until the lungs can be protected by the presenceof an artificial airway, the first responder must be ready tointervene with protective maneuvers such as positioning,suctioning, and the application of cricoid pressure. Positivepressure ventilation may further distend the already fullstomach, especially in children. As soon as the airway issecured, the stomach should be emptied with a nasogastric tubeor a suction catheter.Though it was formerly recommended, the use of theHeimlich maneuver to empty the stomach is now discouraged.Valuable time to the initiation of effective CPR is lost. Gastricemptying past an unprotected airway increases the incidence ofpulmonary aspiration of gastric contents. It is difficult tomaintainthecervicalspineprecautions throughouttheapplication of the Heimlich maneuver. Overly distendedstomachs and passively engorged livers have been ruptured,andischemicpediatricduodenumsarevulnerabletocomplications from forceful thrusts. Most importantly, therescuer may be discouraged from or distracted from doing theone thing that may make a difference in outcome, and that isreestablishing a circulating oxygen supply to the brain.Medical TreatmentThe near-drowning victim has suffered a global hypoxic andischemic insult. The entire organism is affected, not just thebrain and lungs.Intensive care management must addressthese often major multisystem organ injuries to heart, liver,kidneys, intestinal mucosa, and coagulation.Basically, by the time the patient has reached the intensivecare unit, the die has been cast. The ethical dilemma faced byintensivists and the families of the victim is when to stop life-support interventions on a patient with minimal but not absentbrain function.Decision time is usually precipitated aboutthree days post-resuscitation when issues of sepsis, GIbleeding, dialysis,surgical intervention for the intestinalperforation, and intractable seizures present a critical end-organfailure turning point.Unfortunately, the only neurologicassessment tools that intensivists CSP analysis, have littleor no predictive value at 3 days post-injury. In general, if theunsedated patient has not demonstrated some improvement inthe Glascow Coma Scale in three days, the prognosis forcomplete recovery is extremely guarded. To order a test toguide life-support decisions is to give the family false hope.Controversies rage on regarding the value of post-injurytherapeutic interventions.Disappointingly, time and bothprospective and retrospective studies have demonstrated thatmany interventions based on sound and hopeful principles havenot improved neurologic or pulmonary outcomes. Itisgenerally agreed that induced hypothermia(to 90-92 degrees hypovolemia, intracranialpressure monitoring, steroids, and prophylactic antibiotics donot benefit the patient, and may actually worsen the survivalstatistics.

Nowthat technology has evolved fairly effective supports for other133 MARCKJAPRIL 1997 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER failing end-organs, but at present has little to offer foraugmentation of brain recover, efforts to identify reliablepredictors has received renewed attention.Factors Most Frequently Includedin Outcome Analyses* Time of immersion by history* Age of victim* Presence of pulse on the scene*Indication for CPROn the sceneAt presentation to the ER* pH of arterial blood gas on presentation to the ER* Presence of fixed and dilated pupils* Duration of CPR*Presenting core temperature in the ER* Presence of spontaneous respiratory effort in the ER*Presenting blood glucose in the ER*Presenting serum phosphorus and potassium The three assessment scales most commonly used to attemptto predict outcome are 1) the Glasgow Coma Scale, 2) theConn ABC Classification System, and 3) the Orlowski Score.Other factors which are predictively most favorable onpresentation to the Emergency Department include spontaneousrespirations,\" glucose<238+/-170 mg%\u00b0 , no evidenceof aspiration (small A-a gradient)\u00b0, presence of a detectableheartbeat and a core temperature of <33 degrees C.,2\u00b0 andreactive pupils.\u00b0 The initial presence of non-reactive pupilsdoes not have a predictive value, by the way. In Kemp's studyof 330 pediatric British children admitted to the hospitalfollowing a submersion incident, one third of those presentingwith unconsciousness and fixed and dilated pupils still hadgood outcomes. All of those with good outcomes recoveredpupillary responses within six hours of CPR, however.\u00b0Convulsions limited to the first 24 hours and responsive totreatment have been associated with a full recovery. In thesame study, half of the children who became neurologicallyimpaired had convulsions which were difficult to control andwhich persisted beyond the first 24 hours.\u00b0Hypothermia by itself is not a favorable prognostic sign.\u00b0The protective mechanism of hypothermia apparently worksonlyif the decrease in basal metabolism precedes thecirculatory arrest.\u00b0. 19 The observed degree of hypothermia mayalso suggest the duration of the ischemic insult. Thehypothermic patient who has been submersed in relativelywarm water has a very poor prognosis for successfulresuscitation.It is important to recognize how devastating a drowning ornear-drowning can be to the family of the victim.

Siblings are alsoprofoundlyaffected and may experience incapacitatingsurvivor's guilt.PreventionIt is clear that we are limited in our medical ability to\"treat\" the global hypoxic-ischemic insult sustained by thevictim of a significant submersion accident. High technologyhospital management has not significantly altered the fatalityrate except to defer somatic death to a later time. Preservationof patients in persistently vegetative states is a tragedy of ourtimes.Prevention of submersion accidents takes several forms:legislation of effective barriers and a pool inspection program; MARCH/APRIL 1997iWILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER education of the population about barriers, CPR, etc.; improvedaccessto emergency responders (implementationof anationwide 911 system, BLS certification requirements for alllifeguards, commercial river and fishing guides, spa managers,people seeking recreational usage permits, etc.), and improvedsupervision of and education about identified populations atrisk.It is estimatedthat,barrier legislation and inspectionalone could decrease submersion accidents by as much as 80%,as has been demonstrated in Australia and in Washingtonstates, and by the 1981 USCPSC study. Washington state hasalso passed a law against driving while intoxicated for boaters;it remains to be seen if the incidence of alcohol-relatedsubmersion accidents will be decreased as a result.Infant swimming classes have not been found to be aneffective way of \"drownproofmg\" a child or preventing serioussubmersion incidences.It can be argued, in fact, that bygiving a false sense of security to both the child and his parent,that accidental submersions might actually increase. TheAmerican Academy of Pediatrics does not endorse the practiceof encouraging swimming programs for the child less thanthree years of age. 1------GeneralConsensus about PrognosticFactors in Near-drowningFavorable FactorsAge < 3 yearsSubmersion (warm water) < 3 minIce in waterCore temperature < 33\u00b0C.Conscious on arrival to EDPresence of pulse in EDPresence of respiratory effort in EDUnfavorable FactorsSubmersion (warm water) > 9 minsCPR duration > 25 minutesCPR needed on admission to EDpH < 7.0Fixed + dilated pupils > 6 hours after CPRSeizures persisting > 24 hours after CPRHyperglycemia > 450 mg% on ED adm.Cardiotonic drugs needed to get a BP SummaryDrowning and near-drowning are preventable accidents thathave significant morbidity and mortality for a previouslyhealthy and functional population.

There is always a slim chance you'llmiss a spine injury and cause harm to the patient. If youalways want to be certain, every patient should be immobilizedon a backboard. What wilderness medical training offers is away to clear the spine that is extremely accurate, approved bythe Wilderness Medical Society (WMS) and adopted by theState of Maine for urban EMTs. It gives all those patientswho don't have a spine injury freedom from hours or evendays on a backboard and all those rescuers freedom fromcarrying a patient miles and miles to have him cleared fiveminutes after he arrives at the hospital.Second, the patient should receive a full patient assessmentwith his or her head manually immobilized prior to consideringthe patient as one who can have his or her spine cleared. Donot allow your wish to clear the spine interrupt the patient'sneed for a full assessment.Consider the patient's MOI. If the MOI is severe, say, a100 foot leader fall to the ground, you may choose toimmobilize that patient even if he or she passes the test forclearing the spine. Severe head injuries, also, get immobilized.It's the moderate to mild MOIs that we are concerned with.Next, the patient must be reliable: Alert, oriented, withoutdrugs or alcohol on board. Does alert mean alert and orientedto person, place, time, and event (A+0x4)? That would bebest, but if the patient is only A +Ox3 (immediate loss of vividmemory as to the event) he could still be considered forclearing if he meets the rest of the criteria.A reliable patient is also free of distracting injuries thatcould block perception of spinal pain, injuries such as fracturedfemurs and dislocated shoulders.Your first question may be \"What hurts?\" If he or she saysneck or back, he or she gets treated. If the patient complainsof numbness or weakness, the patient gets treated.Then check for altered sensations in the extremities:Numbness on palpation, weakness when checked for strength,pins and needles,inabilityto move, even temperatureirregularities such as cold feet without another reason for coldfeet. Once again, the patient passes or the patient gets treated.Now check for tenderness on palpation. The patient musthave no spinal tenderness, spasms, or guarding, or else he orshe gets a ride on the \"plywood pony.\"As Bill Clem, MD, Mountain Rescue Association MedicalCommittee Chairman says: \"The vast majority of patients whohave cervical spine injuries complain of pain; those who don'twill usually have some tenderness or guarding.\"So far the patient has passed the test.Now, whilesupporting the head, ask the patient to gently flex the neck. Ifno pain, then ask for rotation. If any pain on movement showsup, he gets treatment.Then the patient may be allowed to move about freely butcautiously (if no other injuries, of course, would hampermoving about).If the patient experiences the onset ofnumbness or weakness later, or the onset of sharp pain later(not tightness of muscle spasms), he gets the treatment later.\"What about waiting two hours before clearing of thespine?The teaching of \"wait two hours\" was based on clinical datawhich stated, and still states, that cord impingement will showup within two hours of the injury. However...The WMS Guidelines give no time constraints.Dr. Frank Hubbell, Executive Director of SOLO, says thereis no need to wait two hours.Dr. Peter Goth, founder of Wilderness Medical Associates(WMA), says to only wait \"a few minutes\" to allow anyadrenaline surge that might mask early pain to pass.Dr. Keith Conover, founder of Wilderness EmergencyMedical Services Institute (WEMSI), says there is no need towait beyond a maximum of five minutes. \"If the spine iscracked,\" Dr. Conover says, \"it will hurt right away. Swellingshould make it hurt worse later, but it should hurt plentyenough right away...\"Dr. Conover continues by saying\"...muscular stiffness and then pain starts to develop (from themuscles being tweaked and not from spinal damage, ed.) soonafter the injury, even as soon as an hour. So I'd jump in thereright away and clear the cervical spine before the spasm setsin.Remember: The patient must be reliable, and the patientmust have no distracting injuries. The patient must deny pain,tenderness, and altered sensations in the extremities. (Dr.Conover adds, \"there must be a need to clear the spine.\")2. Are bats a primary reservoir for rabies?Worldwide, bats account for approximately two percent ofall cases of rabies.In the United States, bats account for ahigher percentage of all cases of rabies, perhaps as high as 1416 6 MARCH/APRIL 1997 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER percent according to records dating up to 1989. Thisinformation comes from Wilderness Medicine: Management ofWilderness and Environmental Emergencies, 3rd edition, editedby Paul Auerbach, MD.The Center for Disease Control(CDC) currently lists bats as a primary reservoir along withskunks, foxes, and raccoons.Do vampire bats feed on humans? Do vampire batscarry rabies?\"Vainpire bats feed at night on animal blood, includinghumans...Vampire bats are a vector for rabies in Central andSouth America...small epidemics occur in isolated villages inthe jungle; these can infect and kill up to five percent of thepopulation, up to 17 percent of children, and 22 percent offamilies.\" -Wilderness Medicine: Management of Wildernessand Environmental Emergencies.3. Should very large wounds be packed open with wetdressings or dry dressings?The best answer is wet dressings covered with drydressings, changed a couple of times a day if materials allow.The best solution to wet dressings is probably sterile saline.Sterile water would be next best. Water safe to drink wouldbe third best.Herbie Ogden, MD, medical advisor to the NationalOutdoor Leadership School (NOLS), says: \"Keeping the woundmoist helps to prevent epithelization of the wound edges...Theinner layer eventually dries and, when removed, takes somewound debris with it which keeps the wound clean and open.Because you don't know how the wound will be closed(primary vs. secondary intention) while the evacuation is takingplace,would adopt SOLO's practice (of wet dressingscovered by dry dressings, ed.).\"4. Should infected wilderness wounds be soaked in hotwater or hot salty water?Plain water as hot as the patient can tolerate is probablybest.Tod Schimelpfenig of NOLS offers this insight \"I believethe heat and moisture promotes circulation and draining. Iquestion the addition of salt to this because 1) we can't controlthe osmotic gradients in the salt concentration and maydehydrate viable tissue on the edge of the wound, 2) there ispotential tissue toxicity in high salt concentrations, and 3) Iquestion whether the salt adds anything to an osmotic gradientacross intact tissue.\"5. What's the source of the story of the two-year-old whosurvived 66 minutes of submersion in cold water andlived?Bo lte Rg, Black PG, Bowers RS, Thome JK, Come li 11M:\"The use of extracorporeal rewarming in a child submerged for66 minutes.\" Journal of the American Medical Association1988; 260:377-379.It was a June day near Salt Lake City. The girl was 2.5years old.She fell in a creek.Water temperature wasestimated to be near freezing. She had a core temperature of19 degrees C on entering the hospital. CPR was initiated onsceneandmaintainedforapproximatelytwohours.EST COPY AVAILABLE'-Extracorporeal rewarming then initiated. In EC rewarming,blood is taken from a femoral artery, oxygenated and warmed,and returned to a femoral vein.6. What proportion of Lyme disease patients present thecharacteristic rash called erythema migrans?An uncertainty surrounds the \"bull's-eye\" rash of Lymedisease. Some experts say it appears on as little as 60 percentof patients while others suggest it appears on as many as 80percent. David Weld, Director of the American Lyme DiseaseFoundation, has said the actual number of patients who presentwith the rash may be as high as 90 percent. What we knowfor sure is this: If a patient has the rash, that patient should bestarted on antibiotic therapy as soon as possible to prevent latercomplications associated with the disease.How long does a tick have to be attached to spreadLyme disease to a human?Researchers reporting in The New England Journal ofMedicine, December 17, 1992, wrote: \"When ticks wereattached for less than 48 hours, B. Burgdorferi was transmittedonly rarely by infected nymphal-stage ticks and never byinfected adult female ticks.\" On the other tick-infested hand,83 percent of test animals were infected after a tick wasattached for 72 hours, and 100 percent after a tick was allowedto feed to repletion (more than 120 hours).7. Has the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)approved a poison ivy skin protectant?At least one for sure. Ivy Block skin protectant, a productof EnviroDerm Pharmaceuticals, helps block skin contact withurushiol, the oil in poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumacthat causes the allergic reaction in patients. The lotion must beapplied to skin at least 15 minutes before contact with theplants, and it must be reapplied every four hours. The lotioncan be washed off with soap and water.Editor's Note: If you have other wilderness medicine questionsto which you would like answers, please send them to:Wilderness Medicine NewsletterAsk the ExpertsPO Box 3150, Conway, New Hampshire 03818We will be happy to do the research and print our findings ina future edition of WMN.OUTDOOR LEADERS WANTEDto work for theSTUDENT CONSERVATION ASSOCIATIONThe minimum age requirement is 21.

Their familiar, mysterious formssilhouetted against the graying sky. Everything about themfrom the fearful to the fanciful seems to have ominousovertones: they haunt the night, they fly into women's hair,they suck your blood, they all have rabies, they are anincarnation of the most hideous of ghouls.Of course, when examined objectively, these myths fadelike the light at sunset. Bats little resemble the monsters weimagine them to be.In fact, they are some of the mostimportant cogs in the machinery of our ecosystem. Because ofour human fears and desire to control Nature, many bats arenow in trouble, and with them, the many plants and animalsthey help support and prosper. Let's look more closely at thesecreatures of the night, and perhaps dispel some rumors in theprocess.The first misperception is that bats, because they canfly and they are the only mammals which can are eithermice with wings or awkward birds. In fact, the German wordfor bat \"fleidermaus\" means simply \"flying mouse.\"Actually, bats are much more closely related to humans thaneither mice or birds. Look at the drawing of the bat's wing; if9VOLUME 8, NUMBER 3 you took your human fingers and lengthened them, thenstretched the remaining skin between them, you would comepretty close to the bat's wing (see top of page 3). Additionally,bats are mammals, giving birth to live young and nursing thesame way human mothers do. Birds, instead, lay eggs and donot nurse, and the bone structure and even flight itself hasevolved in a way vastly different from the bat.It is thought that present-day bats evolved from smallinsect-eating mammals, possibly similar to shrews. In order toaid in catching flying bugs, it probably first developed looseflaps of skin between the fore and hind legs, enabling it toglide (as does the misnamed \"flying\" squirrel). Evolutioncontinued from that to today's bat, \"hand wing,\" whichgives us the scientific order: Chiroptera.One of the most prevalent myths is that bats will fly intoand get caught up in people's hair. Part of that may derivefrom another myth: that bats are blind. Certainly, as night-active animals, they do not rely on sight as their primaryinformation source. All bats can see, and some bats haveexcellent vision; however, most use sound echolocation tofind prey. When bats hunt, they emit high-pitched squeaksbeyond the range of the human ear: supersonic. These bounceoff prey and back to the bat like a radar, and tell the bat thesize and direction of the snack. So, even though they can see,bats can also navigate in total darkness! An animal that cantrack a mosquito at thirty feet in total blackness is not likely tomiss an object as large as a human. They may, however, comenear to chase an insect. I have been brushed by bat wingswhile biking at night by headlamp; the bats were chasing theinsects which were attracted to the light.One concern which does have some legitimacy is thatbats are, indeed, carriers of rabies. This is true; bats, like allmammals including humans are susceptible. Rabies is avirus which travels through the nervous system until it infectsthe brain, causing it to swell (encephalitis). The disease travels at a very specific speed (estimated at 3mm/hour), and may takefrom ten to more than.sixty days to reach the brain, dependingon where the patient is bitten. Once it does, however, it is adeath sentence; only three people in recorded history arereported to have survived once the disease reached the brain,and all of those received aggressive immunotherapy. Yet still,despite the immunotherapy two of those suffered severeneurological damage. No one has ever survived the diseasewithout such therapy.That's the bad news. The good news is that rabies seemsto be 100 percent treatable before it reaches the brain.Treatment is not cheap often around $1500 but no longerconsists of twenty or so painful abdominal injections. Insteadonly six shots in the upper arm are given.The rabies virus is concentrated in saliva and brain/spinalcord tissue of the infected mammal. In addition to bats, smallcarnivorous mammals seem to carry the highest risk for rabiesinfection: skunks, foxes, raccoons, as well as unvaccinateddogs and cats. Although it is possible for other mammals tocarry rabies,it is not often reported in the deer family(including elk and moose) or in rodents (mice, squirrels,beavers, woodchucks, and the like), or even in bear. Opossumsase generally not considered infectious. Still, hunters a high-risk group are advised to wear shoulder-length gloves andwash thoroughly when cleaning all mammal carcasses, becauseof exposure to brain and spinal cord tissue.The most common route of exposure is a bite or lickfrom an infected animal. The rabies virus will not pass throughintact skin, but the lick of an open wound can introduceinfection. The bite inoculates the virus-laden saliva directlyinto the system.After exposure to a potentially rabid animal,thewilderness care provider must remember his or her protocolsfor soft tissue care and envenomation. First, put on your latexgloves! If a bite is bleeding, but not enough to cause concernabout the danger of shock, the blood flow will help flush someof the virus out of the wound. A small puncture wound can beencouraged to bleed, but obviously, serious bleeding will needto be controlled. Once bleeding is managed, irrigating andscrubbing the wound are imperative to lessen the amount ofvirus introduced into the system. Different sources show thatfrom 15 to 40 percent of untreated exposures will develop thedisease, even with similar inoculations.One recently documented area of concern for cavers isthe risk that aerosolized bat waste products (urine and feces)in the warm, humid cave environment can transmit the virusthrough the nasal mucosa the thin porous lining inside thenose. However, according to an article in the September, 1996issue of NSS News (a magazine for cavers), Author Danny A.Brass, D.V.M. points out that of the four deaths attributed toaerosolized rabies, two exposures occurred in a laboratoryenvironment, and the other two cases, where victims possiblycould have been exposed in Southwestern caves hosting largecoloniesof MexicanFree-tailedbats,areconsideredinconclusive. Warren C. Lewis, M.D. adds in the December1996 issue of NSS News:Two human deaths from rabies in caves should beexamined criticallybefore beingattributedtoinfected cave air. Rabies virus cannot survive longin daylight at ambient temperatures. It is difficult, ifnot impossible, to transmit the disease by fomites(solid objects) no matter how intimate the contacthas been.After cleaning a wound, it is recommended to see aphysician as quickly as possible. History is important: was thisa high-risk animal? Was its behavior abnormal (an unprovokedfox bite is abnormal; a bite while you are reaching into a dento pet the kits is not)? Most wild animals understandablyare extremely wary of human contact; often perceivedfriendliness is a sign that the animal is extremely ill. Althoughthe \"foaming at the mouth\" picture of rabies (as in moviessuch as Old Yeller) is uncommon, other unusual behaviors caninclude either viciousness (furious rabies) or lethargy (dumbrabies), excessive drooling (probably where the \"foaming\"perception arises), or staggering, drunken behavior (as in ToKill a Mockingbird). The latter is similar to the ataxia found inother brain-swollen patients, such as those with High AltitudeCerebral Edema (HACE).The physical will decide whether rabies therapy isindicated. If so, the patient will get a dose of Rabies ImmuneGlobulin (RIG), 20 International Units per kilogram of bodyweight (IU/kg), one-half infused at the wound site, and one-half injected into the deltoid muscle (shoulder). This is a serumderived from horses, with allergies and side-effects (serumsickness) possible. The other five shots consist of disabledvirus injected in the deltoid on days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 21 or 28.There are two types of vaccine: Human Diploid Cell Vaccine(HDCV), and Rabies Vaccine Adsorbed (RVA).For those in high risk categories (animal control workers,veterinarians and technicians, etc.) there is a pre-exposurevaccine, which is administered on days 0 and 3, and no RIGis required. RIG and vaccine are administered, but in smallerdoses, should a potential infection occur.Now, back to bats. There are more species of bats thanany other mammal group. Their variety is amazing, from thesmallest known mammal the bumble bee bat of Thailand(which is, indeed, its size) up to fruit bats (or \"FlyingFoxes\") of Indonesia, which can have nearly eagle-sizedwingspans of up to six feet.In this country, people seem to fear bats because theylurk in the night, but in some areas where bats are active in thedaytime, as in flying-fox habitat, the animals are respected, andeven venerated. Perhaps the best way to think about bats is intheir environmental niche.Birds have a number of important roles in our ecosystem.As well as decorating windshields, they help pollinate flowers 2 MAY/JUNE 190720WOLDERNESS 14EilaNIE fingercalcartail membrane(along with, of course, the bees), and eat lots of insects. Batssimply take over those roles when the sun goes down. Do youlike bananas? Or those tall Organ Pipe cactus of the desertSouthwest? You can thank bats as the primary pollinators ofthose and many other species such as cashews, figs, and agave,from which we make tequila. In fact, the agave has flowerswhich open only at night to cater specifically to the longnosebat.Hate mosquitoes? Bats are probably the most effectivecontrol we have for the little bloodsuckers (we will deal withthe accused bat \"bloodsucker\" shortly). It is reckoned that onecolony of Mexican Free-tailed bats in Bracken Cave, Texas,consumes about 250 tons of insects every night! That'shalf-a million pounds of bugs! And the guano (feces) from batsis mined in some caves, as it is an excellent fertilizer.Some other interesting bat facts, from a brochure by BatConservation International:A single little brown bat, in one hour, can catch and eat600 mosquitoes.With a following wind, Mexican Free-tailed bat can reachspeeds of 60 miles per hour.Can you hear a beetle walking on the sand six feet away?The African Heart-nosed bat can.The echolocation of the Fishing Bat is so sensitive, it candetect a minnows fin on a pond's surface, and then scoopit up like an osprey.A little brown bat can live up to 32 years.Not only does bat guano make great fertilizer, it alsosupports the life in the cave ecosystem. Plus, humans areusing bacteria found in it to detoxify wastes, makegasohol, improve detergents, and produce antibiotics.The anticoagulant in vampire bat saliva may somedayhelp bat: it is hard to imagine acreature with a more sinister reputation. From ancient legendsof the tyrant ghoul by Bela Lugosi, the vampirehas conjured apparitions of the undead Nosferatu whoroam the earth by night seeking to satiate their unquenchablelust for human blood. The reality, however, is not only quitedifferent, but rather mundane.The vampire bat is a sparrow-sized little bat. True, it doesfeed exclusively on blood any mammal blood. Humans arerarely and only incidentally a meal. Only one speciesDiphylla ecaudata barely enters the United States, and thisprefers the blood of birds.Vampires have two razor-sharpincisors, which they use to make a small slit, often near thehoof or rump of a domestic farm animal. The sameanticoagulant which may someday save human lives allows theblood to flow for a bit without clotting, and the bat, whiletrying not to disturb the large hoofed mammal and get steppedon, gingerly laps up the blood in a way likened to a catlapping up a bowl of milk. Total consumption is only ateaspoon or two, although several bats can feed off the sameanimal in one evening, but usually the animal doesn't evennotice the loss. Contrary to mythology, the vampire does notsuck blood at all. Only in Hollywood. 21Vampires do occasionally inflict rabies on domesticlivestock from Mexico through South America, often resultingin an the destruction of an entire colony. On humans, thesebats will generally go for a non-sensitive area with decentblood flow, such as between the toes. Precautions for humansare easy to take: sleep with windows closed or install screens.The worldwide mortality for humans infected by rabidvampires was not found, but it iscertainlystatisticallyinsignificant compared with snakebite, bee stings, or, in theUnited States, the animal most likely to cause a human death,the deer. Bambi is a killer; according to Shooting magazine,more than twice as many Americans die from automobile/deercollisions as from the next most dangerous animal, the bee.That study from Shooting also showed deer to be moredangerous than all other animals combined, except humans.What many people do not know is that vampires are oneof the few creatures in the animal kingdom which will sharea meal with a sick roostmate, or even adopt an orphaned bat.With all the fear and fantasy surrounding bats, and oursubsequent human reaction wipe them out you mightsuspect that some bats are in trouble. And you'd be right. Allover the world bats are endangered, for many reasons. As withother species, habitat destruction is a major factor. Many batsrequire very specific conditions in which to nurture theiryoung, often in caves or abandoned mines. Many of theseareas have been vandalized, driving the bats away, or worse,sealed off to prevent people from falling or wandering in,sometimes with the bats inside.Partially because it is in their interest as well, the cavingcommunity has been accomplishing much in conserving theseareas. Instead of dumping a load of cement into the opening(which has been done by property owners or communities onoccasion to absolve them of liability issues), cavers and batconservationists and some individuals are both COPY MfAIL-A6L`c D'lY/JUAIE 9eD7 MILDERMESZ PMEDOCOME MEC/VIEWER working to seal off access to the general public, but make theentry still available to both cavers and bats. This is doqe bysealing' the opening with a bat-friendly grate, small enough toexclude human access, but easy for the bats to come and gofor nightly feedings or winter hibernation. The cavers havekeyed access to the padlocked gate. Obviously, educatedlandowners are playing a huge role in this protection.There are,however, other strains on these flyingmammals: pesticides, the destruction of rain forest, predation,export for food, to name a few. The rate at which bats aredisappearing is shocking; almost 40 percent of U.S. bat speciesare now endangered. In one instance, nearly 30 millionMexican Free-tailed bats were destroyed by vandals in anArizona cave. At Carlsbad Caverns, there are only 1/32 thenumber of bats as before, most likely due to pesticides.On the other side, there are groups working feverishly toreverse these trends. A major obstacle to support is not theacknowledgment of the bat's role in the ecology, but many ofthe myths mentioned at the beginning of the article. To mostpeople, bats are still shrouded in mystery, they are notperceived as \"cute and cuddly\", as are, say, koalas or giantpandas. Surprisingly, many bats, like the little brown bat ormany of the flying foxes, are indeed attractive up close. Butmost people do not have the opportunity to view bats up close,in full light. There are a few organizations trying to changethat.Dr. Merlin D. Tuttle wrote America's Neighborhood Bats.He also founded Bat Conservation International (BCI). BCI isperhaps the leading organization concerned with making theworld a better place for bats and people. Dr. Tuttle'sorganization supports research and education all over theworld. BCI had a big hand in developing Masters of the Night,a traveling exhibit presently making the rounds of sciencemuseums across the nation, packing in the crowds. Still, whenI saw the show in Boston, there were people, mostly adults,who said, \"I don't care, they're still disgusting.\"Based in Austin, Texas, BCI has been working to educatepeople, especially young people, convincing them that bats areattractive, intelligent, and vital. A BCI poster shows Ding, anIndian Flying Fox hanging upside down (the way all batssleep), with the caption: \"Sleep all day, hang out all night. Nowonder kids love bats.\"Ironically, Austin is also the home of a unique eveningritualthat draws thousands of tourists to the city:theemergence of the bats. The Congress Avenue Bridge wasdesigned with crevices underneath to provide shelter for thelocal colony of Mexican Free-tails. Just at dusk, millions andmillions of bats pour out from underneath the bridge for anight of scraping insects from the skies over Austin.If our former nighttime nemesis the bat can be atourist attraction, or attract a museum crowd, perhaps there isstill hope for its future.

Wherecan 1 purchase it?Permethrin, originally extracted from chrysanthemumflowers, is a potent insect neurotoxin currently synthesized forhuman use as an insect repellent. \"It's not really a repellent,\"says Dr. Murray Hamlet, Director of Operations for the USArmy Research Institute for Environmental Medicine, \"it's aninsect killer.\" Within minutes after contact with permethrin-treated clothing, the insect dies. It bonds strongly to the fibersof clothing and, depending on the concentration and applicationprocess, can withstand numerous washings, remaining active,in some cases, for years. \"An application of the spray,\" saysDr. Hamlet, \"may last up to five washings, and an applicationof the concentrate may last up to 50.\" Permethrin is colorlessand odorless, and does no harm to vinyl, plastic, or otherfabrics.It can be applied to mosquito nettings on tents, tosleeping bags, even to window screens at home. It should notbe applied to human skin. After many tests, the experts agreeit apparently does no harm to humans, but it does work as arepellent or insecticide when applied to skin. \"With normaluse,\" says Dr. Hamlet, \"it is a safe and extraordinary advancein protection against insects.\"Permethrin is available under the trade names Permanonefrom Wisconsin Pharmacal, Duranon from Coulston Products,and Permethrin Tick Repellent from Sawyer Products. It isavailable from many suppliers of outdoor products, and can beordered from Sawyer Products (800-940-4464), REI (800 -426-4840), Sportsman Guide(800-888-3006), and Ranger Joe's (800-247-4521). 3.Is there such a thing as a field treatment for secondand third degree burns that consists of an occlusivedressing?\"Covering wounds reduces pain and evaporative losses,but do not use an occlusive dressing,\" recommends theWilderness Medical Society Practice Guidelines for WildernessEmergency Care.Thomas Burke, MD, a Denver-basedemergency medicine physician who advises the WildernessMedicine Institute, supports the WMS guideline for burnmanagement. \"You want the burn to drain,\" says Torn, \"andI wound not suggest an occlusive dressing for any burn.\" Tomcontinues: \"I prefer the field treatment of burns to be a layerof antibiotic ointment.\" Editor's Note: If you have other wilderness medicine questionsto which you would like answers, please send them to:Wilderness Medicine Newsletter, Ask the Expert, PO Box 3150,Conway, New Hampshire 03818 We will be happy to do the research and print our findings ina future edition of WMN.

They havebattled with defeats and celebrated successes, and, along withtheir male counterparts, have been bruised and battered byunmerciful environments indifferent to gender or physiology.There is no denying that differences exist between the sexes.Men and women were not created equal, superiorities andinferiorities being a matter of perspective and/or circumstance.Women have vastly more complex reproductive anatomies andhighlysensitiveendocrinesystemswhich makethemvulnerable to a number of problems which do not befall men.This article will address some of those differences as well ascommon maladies that women routinely deal with in thebackcountry. Some of these problems develop over time andare more of a concern on long expeditions; others are morefrequently experienced by women who spend much of theirtime outdoors doing strenuous physical activities. Most of thecommon problems that are discussed can happen on short twoor three day trips.ENDOCRINE ANDGENITOURINARY PROBLEMSMENSTRUAL CYCLE DISTURBANCES:Menstrual cycle disturbances, from physical and psychologicalstresses experienced by women on wilderness trips, are verycommon occurrences.While this may be an annoyance ontrips of short duration, it can become a health issue on longerexpeditions. Amenorrhea especially (the absence of menstrualperiods) should be a concern as it signals a state of estrogendeprivation which, over the long term (10 or more years), willlead to a decrease in bone density (osteoporosis), puttingwomen at increased risk for fractures. (Amenorrhea is oftenseen in highly-trained athletes.) Hormonal therapy such asestrogenand/orprogesteronesupplementsororalcontraceptives will help to regulate menstrual cycles andreduce the risk of osteoporosis.Dysfunctional uterine bleeding, or unexpected menstrualbleeding with no anatomic cause (such as uterine fibroids orcysts), may also result from hormonal imbalances. Estrogensupplements can help here, as well. Uterine bleeding fromruptured fibroids, ovarian cysts or abscesses, on the other hand,will not respond to hormonal therapy and is a true life-threatening emergency. (Ovarian cysts in and of themselves arenot life threatening.)Another potential health concern unique to menstruatingwomen is anemia. Menstruation is not considered a cause ofanemia; instead, it is seen in young women, usually secondaryto diet. Monthly bleeding results in lower hemoglobin counts(hemoglobin is the oxygen-carrying part of the blood). Ironsupplements can help, as iron islost through menstrualbleeding and is a necessary component for the production ofhemoglobin.Signs and symptoms of anemia are excessivetiredness and fatigability, breathlessness on exertion, pallor,and poor resistance to infection. Considering the demands ofexpeditions, anemia can constitute a serious health risk forwomen on extended trips, especially at altitude. (There issome evidence to suggest that women are more susceptible toAcute Mountain Sickness than men [headache, anorexia,nausea, malaise], although the manifestation of pulmonaryedema at altitudeisless common in women.) Duringpregnancy especially, women should minimize time spent ataltitude as there is a fourfold higher incidence of toxemianoted at high altitude.Pregnancy, otherwise,is not acontraindication for women in the backcountry, in the absenceof complications.There is no evidence that exercise duringpregnancy is detrimental to the fetus, and pregnant women inthe wilderness may perform as well or better than those in anon-pregnant state provided endurance training is maintainedthroughout the pregnancy. Pre-natal care should be continuedas much as possible on extended trips, and it is especiallyimportant to monitor blood pressure regularly during thesecond andthirdtrimestersto watch for pre-eclampsia2 7 (pregnancy-induced high blood pressure) which may progressto more serious complications.URINARY TRACT INFECTION:Inflammations of urinary tracts (urethra, bladder, ureters), UTIsare more common in women than in men due to poor toilethabits (wiping back to front which introduces fecal bacteriainto the urethra) and the relatively short length of the urethra(allowing bacteria a quick access to the bladder).Signs and symptoms of a UTI can include an increase in thefrequency and/or urgency of urination with reduced output; aburning sensation during urination; pain above the pubic bone;cloudy or blood-tinged urine. The primary danger with a UTIis that it can progress to a kidney infection, a potentially life-threatening condition. (Signs and symptoms of kidney infectioncan include tenderness in the small of the back, pain in thegroin area, severe headache, and fever).Treatment of a UTI includes drinking lots of water to flush outbacteria (helps to prevent UTIs as well); cleaning the perinealarea regularly; taking vitamin C supplements and/or consumingfoods which can make the urine more acidic (to preventbacteria from growing) such as whole grains, fruits and nuts.White flours, rice or pastas, and refined sugar may predisposepeople to infection, and spicy foods such as curry, cayenne,chili and black pepper; caffeine; and alcohol can irritate thebladder.On extended expeditions, it's a good idea to carry antibioticsfor a UTI.Consult a physician prior to departure for anappropriate UTI antibiotic therapy. If the infection persists forgreater than 48 hours despite the use of antibiotics, evacuate.Also, evacuate anyone with signs and symptoms of a kidneyinfection.VAGINITIS:A common backcountry AND frontcountry malady, vaginitisis an inflammation of the vagina. Infections usually resultfromdecreasedresistanceofthebodytocertainmicroorganisms. These microorganisms are normally presentin the vagina but are usually held in check by various defenses,such asLactobacillus,a friendly bacteria that keeps the vaginaslightly acidic, inhibiting growth of potentially harmfulorganisms.Therearethree common typesof vaginalinfections: 1.Bacterial vaginosis, the most common vaginal infection,is caused by an overgrowth of organisms normally foundin the vagina or bowel.It may or may not be spreadthrough sexual contact.The main symptom is a thin,gray or milky discharge that has a foul or fishy odor(most pronounced after intercourse). Some itching mayoccur in the vaginal area 2.Candidiasis (yeast infection) is caused by a fungus thatusually exists harmlessly in the mouth, digestive tract,and vagina.Certain factors may upset the balance oforganisms and lead to yeast infection (pregnancy,diabetes, obesity, bcp, steroids, antibiotics). According tothe US Department of Health and Human Services, 75%of all women will have atleast one episode ofCandidiasis in their lives and many will have recurrentbouts. The main symptoms are a thick, cottage-cheesydischarge with itching and burning of the vagina. Painfulurination and intercourse are also common. 3.Richomoniasis, caused by a parasitic protozoa, occurs inboth men and women. It is usually spread through sexualcontact but can, in some instances, be transmitted throughwashcloths, wet towels, or bathing suits. Typical signsand symptoms are a profuse gray or yellow-greendischarge with a foul or fishy odor. There is usuallysome itching and inflammation of the vaginal area, andthere may be burning during urination.A variety of factors can alter the vaginal environment andmake it the perfect setting for malicious microorganisms to setup shop. These include taking birth control pills or antibiotics;changes in vaginal tissues caused by menopause; a diet high insugar, caffeinated beverages, and /or alcohol; stressbothphysical and emotional; damage from prolonged or frequentintercourse or tampon use; diabetes. Also, some women arejust more predisposed to vaginitis than other women.In the backcountry, improper hygiene is often the source ofvaginitis:not cleaning the perineal area regularly, notchanging underwear regularly, wiping from back to front aftera bowel movement, or wearing a wet bathing suit or shorts forprolonged periods of time.Treatment in the field is aimed at restoring the pH of thevagina. The patient can douche with plain, disinfected wateror a povidone iodine solution (2 tablespoons per liter) ideallyin the morning and evening at onset of infection. On extendedtrips, or for women with a history of vaginal infections, youmay want to bring an over-the-counter anti-fungal cream(generic namemiconazole; brand namesMonistat, Gyne-Lotrimin, etc) for the infections and a prescription oralantibiotic (metronidazole) for the non-yeast varieties. Also,garlic as a suppository in the vagina (crushed and wrapped ingauze) has been suggested but there is no evidence to supportor refute this application. Plain yogurt in the vagina has alsobeen recommended for yeast infections by some gynecologists.(Keeping yogurt from spoiling on some trips would be a realchallenge.)If the treatment given doesn't provide relief in 48 hours, thepatient needs to be evacuated as the infection may develop intosomething more serious such as Pelvic Inflammatory Disease(PID).The best prevention for all vaginitis is to stay well-hydrated;decrease sugar, caffeine, and alcohol intake; wear cottonunderwear and loose-fitting clothing to allow air to circulatewhich discourages bacterial growth; wash the perineal areadaily; change tampons regularly; and decrease stress.282 JULY/AUGUST 1997 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER PELVIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASE:An inflammation of the reproductive organs (fallopian tubes,ovaries and/or uterus), PIED is one of the most commoninfections in women (in the US there are approximately 1million cases a year with about one quarter of those requiringhospitalization). It is also one of the most common sources ofabdominal pain among women of reproductive age and occursalmost exclusively in sexually active women. Most prevalentin women under 30, it peaks in women between the ages of20-24. Although it is primarily caused by sexually transmittedmicroorganisms such as gonorrhea and chlamydia bacteria, PIDcan be caused by staphylococcus or streptococcus bacteria aswell.Signs and symptoms appear during or immediately after themenstrual period and begin as an achy, crampy, diffuse pain inthe middle of the lower abdomen, developing gradually into aconstant ache. The patient may also complain of pain in theupper right quadrant of the abdomen (due to bacterial irritationof tissues surrounding the liver), as well as lower back or legpain. These complaints are usually accompanied by flu-likesymptoms such as fever and chills, nausea and/or vomiting,diarrhea, and fatigue. The patient may have a watery, foul-smelling vaginal discharge.She may complain of irregularbleeding, an increase in menstrual cramps, or bleeding duringor after intercourse. Some women develop acne-like rashes onthe back, chest, neck, or face.Field treatment for women experiencing PID is evacuation (andantibiotics) as PID left untreated can lead to peritonitis(inflammation of the abdominal lining) and possibly scarringof the fallopian tubes which can result in sterility and evendeath.It also increases the potential for ectopic pregnancy inthe future.Risk factors include frequent sex with multiplepartners, use of an IUD (intrauterine device), and a previoushistory of PID.TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME:TSS is an infection caused by the bacterium Staphylococcusaureus, a bacteria often presentand harmlesson the skinbut dangerous when it enters the bloodstream. Tampons havebeen suggested as one of the possible causes of Toxic ShockSyndrome (TSS). Super absorbent tampons that dry the vaginaor cause blackflow of blood into the peritoneal cavity maypredispose women to TSS. The highest incidence is reportedin 10-30-year-old menstruating white females.TSS commonly presents with sudden onset of general flu-likesymptomshigh fever, chills, muscle aches, abdominal pain,vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, dizziness and/or fainting, sorethroat, and a sunburn-like rash. In some people the onset maybe gradual, and the characteristic rash does not appear for 1 or2 days.The rash appears on the palms of hands or all overbody and typically peels, like a sunburn, one to two weekslater. Mucus membranes are beet red.Field treatment for TSS is to remove the tampon, if present,and treat for shock.Evacuation is critical as this is a life- 3threatening condition.Antibiotic therapy should be startedimmediately.Proper hygiene in the backcountry can go a long way towardsprevention of TSSchange tampons frequently (every fewhours) and use pads at night and on low-flow days. The staphbacteria is often found on hands, so wash thoroughly prior toinserting tampons. If a patient has had TSS previously, thereisa 30% chance of recurrence. Fortunately, modernimprovements in tampons have helped to correct the problem,and incidences of TSS are becoming extremely rare.ECTOPIC PREGNANCY:Ectopic literally means \"occurring in an abnormal position,\"and an ectopic pregnancy is any pregnancy that occurs outsideof the uterusmost commonly in the fallopian tubes (95% ofectopic pregnancies are \"tubal\" pregnancies). Due tocongenital anomalies or scarring caused by infections orabscesses, the fertilized egg begins to grow in the tube.Ectopic pregnancies are on the rise and account for 1.4% of allpregnancies.They are also the most common cause ofmaternal death in the first trimester.Some time between the fifth and sixth week after the lastmenstrual period, the patient will experience abdominal painand bleeding. The pressure exerted on the wall of the tube(or elsewhere) by the embryo causes crampy and intermittent,unilateral lower abdominal pain. As the embryo becomes toolarge for the tube, it may rupture or the embryo may beaborted out the fimbriated (open) end of the tube. Bothscenarios produce abrupt agonizing pain that is localized andconstant.The pain may also radiate to the shoulder due todiaphragmaticirritationfromintraperitonealbleeding.Shoulder pain indicates a large volume of blood in theperitoneal cavity and shock may develop rapidly, althoughslow bleeding is more common with ectopic pregnancies.Sixty-five percent of patients will have vaginal bleeding aswell as the intraperitoneal bleeding. (The vaginal bleedingcomes in part from the shedding of the uterine lining as theembryo is disrupted from the site of implantation and ceasesthe production of hormones. Vaginal bleeding may be slightor considerable and is no indication of how much blood hasbeen lost internally.)Ectopic pregnancies are life-threatening emergencies, and anywomen of child-bearing age complaining of acute abdomenshould be evacuated. Treatment for shock is essential.Risk factors include previous ectopic pregnancy, use of anIUD, history of PID, abdominal/pelvic surgery.ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNSWhen it comes to weathering the elements, women fare just aswell asand in some circumstances better thantheir malecounterparts.According to Joseph Mortola and GunhildeBuchsbaum in WILDERNESS MEDICINE, Management ofWilderness and Environmental Emergencies, women adaptmore easily to hot, wet environments than do men of equal JULY/AUGUs191997 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER size and fitness because of their generally lower sweat rate.Less sweating reduces a woman's risk of dehydration.Conversely, in a hot, dry environment, men's higher sweat rateis more advantageous where perspiration decreases the risk ofhyperthermia. But once acclimated to dry heat (a two-weektraining period in hot, dry weather will provide sufficientacclimation), females can substantially increase their sudorific(sweat) response.Women in cold environments adapt better, on average, thanmenpossibly due to their thicker subcutaneous fat layer.Their lower muscle mass (relative to males) decreasesinsulation somewhat but may be disadvantageous only inextreme low temperatures.Also, it has been found thatexercise performed during cold exposure is more effective inmaintaining body heat in women than in men.One area where women are more susceptible to cold injuriesthan men is with Raynaud's Disease. Raynaud's isahypersensitive vasoconstriction response of the peripheralvessels to cold or decreases in temperature. Vessels in handsand/or feet clamp down more tightly, more quickly, and, takelonger to open up in someone with Raynaud's than in someoneexperiencing a normal vasoconstriction response. Though mencan have Raynaud's, it is most common in women, especiallybetween the ages of 15-45. In and of itself, Raynaud's is nota major health concern, but the condition may predispose oneto frostbite in freezing environments. (Note, however, thatextreme cold is not necessary to bring on the Raynaud'sresponse;a significant drop in temperature [e.g., 70-50degrees F], even in temperate environments, may precipitateRaynaud's.) Signs and symptoms of Raynaud's are similar toincipient frostbiteaffected parts (fingers and/or toes) arewhite and waxy in appearance (usually with a clear line ofdemarcation), and there is a feeling of numbness or loss ofsensation.Keeping extremities and the torso warm and dr)iwill help to prevent episodes of Raynaud's, but treatmentconsists of one of two methods: (1) Pharmacological therapy(sympatholytic agents and calcium channel blockers) has beenshown to give positive results in about 50% of affectedpatients;(2) A Pavlovian-typetherapyisaimedatreconditioningthe body to respond differently to coldenvironments or to significant drops in temperature. Thetraining consists of immersing one's hands in warm water, firstin a warm indoor setting for 2-5 minutes and then in a coldenvironment for 10 minutes, followed by a final immersionindoors for 2-5 minutes. This procedure needs to be repeated3-6 times a day every other day for a total of about 50 trials.Though somewhat time intensive, this technique has beenproven to be effective and results can last for a number ofyears.Another environmental health threat, whether in a hot or coldenvironment, is direct exposure to the sun. Radiation from thesun can pose long-term health problems in the form of skincancers. This holds true for both men and women, but studiesshow that from the ages of 20-39, women develop melanoma(the rarest but deadliest of skin cancers) up to twice as oftenas men. It is the most common cancer for women in their late20s and second only to breast cancer in 30-34 year-old women.Why isskin cancer more common in young women?According to Allan Halpern, MD (Chairman of the SkinCancer Screening Program Task Force of the AmericanAcademy of Dermatology) young womenunlike menworkon getting tans. That means more exposure to harmful UVAand UVB radiation (whether from the sun or from tanningbooths)a direct link to skin cancer. Also, more women aredoing high-altitude mountaineering these days where UVradiation is increased due to the thinner atmosphere and thereis more reflection of harmful rays from the snow.Obviously, prevention is the best defense against skin cancerand that means decreasing exposureespecially when the sunis the strongest (between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.). If you must bein the sun, use a sunscreen with a Sun Protection Factor (SPF)of at least 15, applying it at least 30 minutes before going out,and use sun block (zinc oxide) on lips, nose, and othersensitive areas.Also, cover up with tight-weave clothing ofthicker fabrics and darker colors that afford the most protection(the average cotton t-shirt offers an SPF of only 6-9 and only3 when wet). Wear hats with brims and sunglasses with UVprotection.And remember: early detection is important intreating all types of skin cancer, so watch for changes in thesize and shapes of moles and birthmarks, which can be earlyindicators.Another environmental concern that has been raised regardingwomen in the backcountry is the association of animal attackswith menstrual bloodspecifically bears and sharks. Morethan a few women have been cautioned against going into bearcountry during their period. However, there is no evidence toprove or disprove the association. Certainly, bears that areprovoked, startled, or hungry are more inclined to attack, butthe odor of blood may attract a variety of animals, includingbears.Therefore, appropriate hygiene and disposal practicesin the backcountry are recommended. Tampons/napkinsshould be placed in sealed zip-lock bags (an aspirin or twothrown in can help dissipate the odor) and stored away fromcamp or burned in a very hot fire. (Better to be safe than tobe somebody's statistic).Consider \"Jaws,\" on the other hand ....The great whitesharkthe most dangerous of sharks and one commonlyassociated with human attacksis indeed quite adept at honingin on blood.It can detect blood in water at one part permillionwhich makes any open wound a risk factor in shark-infested waters.Indeed, swimming at all in shark-infestedwaterswith or without open wounds or menstrual flowisprobably not the best way to spend your vacation.GYNECOLOGICAL PREPARATIONTo help ensure a safe and healthy trip, any woman consideringa strenuous, extended expedition, should consider the followingbefore departure: 1.A pregnancy test should be taken. If a woman ispregnant with no contraindications, there is no reason she0 4 JULY/AUGUST 1997 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER should not go on the trip provided the fetus is clearlydemonstrated (by ultrasound) to be intrauterine and atleast 8 weeks gestational age (earlier than that carries a25% chance of miscarriage). 2.Hormonal contraception is recommended (oral, injectable,or indwelling pill-less, however, can cause uterinebleeding) both for the prevention of pregnancy on the trip(any pregnancy remote from medical care carries risk forboth the fetus and the mother) and for the prevention ofirregular, dangerous, and difficult to diagnose uterinebleeding. 3.A gynecological exam should be done todetectpreventable difficulties such as uterine fibroids (that couldresult in profuse and hormonally unresponsive bleeding)and cysts that may be inclined to rupture during strenuousexercise.Since there are gender-specific concerns for women in thebackcountry on extended trips, it is a wise idea to carry firstaid supplies specific to treating those problems.

YOUNG LOUDS AND FIREby Buck TiltonYou imagine, when you talk with Holly, when she speaks inher matter-of-fact tone, in her confident and easy manner, thatshe would be calm \"under fire,\" someone you'd want on yourside when things got hot. And you would, I have decided, becorrect.On the Fourth of July, 1987, Holly was co-leading a group often 14- and 15-year-old females, and they had set a camp inthe woods in the vicinity of Sebago Lake in Maine. Althoughthe morning had been bright and beautiful, storm cloudsshadowed the site as dinner water neared boiling on the PeakOne stove. Holly wore cotton shorts and a T-shirt.When the water bubbled furiously, the other instructor movedthe pot, a large one, to a rock and turned hurriedly away,knocking the pot to the ground. Most of the scalding liquidlanded in Holly's lap. Some of it splashed onto the lower legsof the second leader who immediately began to scream in painand fright. Panic swept the group, and Holly's attention wasdiverted to settling the young women down and managing herco-leader's burns. \"It was three minutes tops,\" says Holly,\"until I noticed I was soaked in steaming water from my waistto my knees.\" Those three minutes proved critical.She rapidly stripped off all her cotton clothes ... \"death cloth\"she now calls it. Intense heat had been trapped against herskin, the burning process penetrating deeper and deeper. Theonly cold water in camp was in water bottles, water which shefirst began to pour on her abdomen and thighs, then used towet bandannas that were placed on her burns. Holding thebandannas as best she could, Holly, followed by the entiregroup, hiked to the lake and a private campground where shewalked into the shower room and stood for an hour under thecold water. Great boggy blisters filled on her lower bodyaround pale areas that continually weeped clear fluid. 5 JULY/AUGUST 1997 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER Someone dialed 911 from the camp office, but the storm hadbroken in summer fury, flooding the roads and blowing treesto the ground. The ambulance arrived in gushing raintwo-and-a-half hours after the call. In that time Holly felt\"more pain than I can remember,\" but the group demanded hercare, and she gave it. When the ambulance pulled away withboth the burned women, Holly had shifted management of thegroup to the camp's director.Approximately seven hours after the incident Holly arrived atthe nearest hospital. The hospital staff gave their immediateattention to the second instructor, the one \"obviously\" in painand distress. Holly's quiet lack of complaint relegated her toa room for observation and later treatment. After three days,she says, \"the lower front of my body looked like leather andsteady doses of morphine failed to keep the pain away.\" Shehad burns to the second and third degree over approximately15 percent of her body. It was almost three weeks before sheleft the hospital. The co-leader went home long before Holly.Scalding hot liquids and erupting flammable fuels produce themajority of serious wilderness burns. Bums from campfires,hot cooking gear and stoves typically cause minor injuriesrequiring little care. The Wilderness Medical Society PracticeGuidelines for Wilderness Emergency Care (ICS BOOKS, Inc.,Merrillville, IN, $12.95) says initial bum care, despite theseriousness, should be directed toward stopping the burningprocess, \"within 30 seconds, if possible.\" Cool the burn withwater. Remove clothing and jewelry from the burn area. Donot try to remove anything stuck to the burn. Check the patientfor injuries that might have occurred in addition to the bum.How long does the cooling process take? No definitive answerexists. As long as cool water makes the patient feel better, andhypothermia is not a threat, you can keep the water flowing forup to two hours. \"Trust me,\" says Holly, \"every little bithelps.\"After cooling, bums should be assessed in three ways: 1.Depth. First Degree burns are superficial damage to theepidermis, look red and feel painful. Second Degreebums are partial thickness burns of the dermis (the trueskin), forming blisters in addition to redness and pain.Third Degree injuries penetrate the full thickness of thedermis, produce no blisters, and look pale (scald burns)or charred (burns from other high-heat sources). Thirddegree burns may not cause pain themselves, but theywill be surrounded by areas of intense pain. Bums areoften a combo of one or more depths, and it may taketime, an hour or more in some instances, before you canjudge the depth of the burn. The greater the degree ofdamage, naturally, the greater the need for professionalmedical attention. \"All burn wounds are sterile for thefirst 24 to 48 hours,\" says the Practice Guidelines. Butinfection almost invariably results eventually withoutprofessional care to deep burns.2.Extent. To determine the amount of the patient's bodysurface area that has been burned use the Rule of Nines.Each arm represents nine percent of the total bodysurface area (TBSA). Each leg represents 18 percent(nine for the front, nine for the back of the leg), the frontof the torso represents 18 percent, the back of the torso18 percent, the head nine percent and the groin onepercent. First degree bums are easily managed no mattertheir extent. Second and third degree bums covering morethan 15 percent TBSA are often life-threatening andrequire immediate evacuation. Serious degree bums to theface may cause airway damage, and should be consideredfor immediate evacuation. Third degree bums to thehands, feet or genitals require professional attention assoon as possible. 3.Pain. The patient's level of pain will help you evaluatethe seriousness of the burn. Pain should resolve within 24hours for first degrees bums. Deeper bums will causeincreasingly severe pain. If the pain can be controlled inthe wilderness, the bum can often be managed in thewilderness.After cooling and assessment, your wilderness care should bedirected toward keeping the wound clean and reducing thepain. Dirty burn wounds should be washed with greatgentleness, tepid water and mild soap. After washing, pat thewound dry. To protect burns and ease the pain, leave theblisters of second degree burns intact. If the blisters pop whilea physician is still far away, or if you're dealing with thirddegree burns, you can do one or more of several things: (1)Cover the burn with a thin layer of antibiotic ointment. (2)Cover the bum with Water -Jel\" (pain-relievinggelorgel-soaked dressings), Spenco 2nd Skin\" or Nortrade'sBurnfree with dry gauze orcleandryclothing.Covering burnsreducespain andevaporative fluid losses.Do not use an occlusive dressing, one that prevents all air orwater from passing through. Do not place ice on large burns.When the trip to the doctor will not be a long one, do notre-dress or re-examine the burn. If evacuation will take morethan a day, change the dressings at least once a day: removeold dressings, remove old ointment (you may have to gentlywash off old ointment with tepid water) and re-apply freshointment and dressings.Serious burns will swell and, when possible, such as burns toarms and legs, the extremities should be elevated to minimizeswelling. Burned patients should gently and regularly exerciseburned body areas as much as they can tolerate.\"Ibuprofen,\" says the Practice Guidelines, \"is probably the bestover-the-counter analgesic for bum pain (including sunburn).\"Burned patients should be encouraged to drink as much wateras they can during the entire evacuation process. 6 JULY/AUGUST 199732WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER . After leaving the hospital Holly began a six-month-longregimen of smearing on aloe and vitamin E oil three to fourtimes every day and exercising often in order to heal betterwith less scarring. She is still, she says, \"very sensitive to hotand cold water and direct sunlight.\"I wanted to know what Holly thought was, as a professionalcare provider, the most important lesson she'd learned fromher accident.The loudest patients,\" she said without hesitation, \"are usuallyhurt the least.\"ASK THE EXPERTS... Should an attempt be made to reduce hip dislocations inthe field?Wilderness Medicine: Management of Wilderness andEnvironmental Emergencies, Third Edition states, \"If it willbe more than six hours before the victim can be evacuated toa definitive care center, closed reduction (of the hip) should beattempted.\" Edward L. Farrar, MD, an orthopaedic surgeon,offers a less specific time line: \"Generally a classic posteriordislocation a long way from medical care should probably bereduced.\"Joseph Serra, MD, an orthopaedic surgeon andcontributortotheWilderness Medical Society PracticeGuidelines provides more aggressive advice: \"Forget thepossibility of an associated fracture and go for a reduction (ofthe hip).\" The Practice Guidelines flatly state: \"It is importantto diagnose and reduce a dislocation quickly after it occurs.\"(Note: Serra's technique is described in Medicine for theBackcountry, Second Edition.) As Wilderness Medicinecontinues: \"If this maneuver fails to reduce the hip, evacuationmust be expedited because there is a direct relationshipbetweenthetimetoreductionandtheincidenceofosteonecrosis of the femoral bead.\" Editor's Note:There was a slight \"typo\" in our last edition that many of ourreaders brought to my attention.

Morerecently, there has been an explosive growth in internationaladventure travel. Conservative estimates state that there areover 300 million international travelers per year, some onbusiness and many on holiday. It is also estimated that theinternational tourism portion of those travelers generates anexcess of $100 billion annually. A rapidly growing part ofinternational tourism isadventure travel and ec,otourism,marked by trips that are more and more frequently takingtourists to the wonderfully lush and diverse tropical and remoteregions of the world a world that is rich with life andbiodiversity with a wide variety of beautiful birds and colorfulplants, as well as venomous snakes and disease-spreadinginsects.It is extremely rare that a person becomes a meal for a lion,tiger, or bear. But it is very common for people to become theunintentional home for microscopic parasites that \"worm theirway into our intestinal tracts through our consumption ofcontaminated food or water. These uninvited guests canpotentially cause serious disease or illness which can last yearsor may even cause death.Crystal clear water in any part ofthe world that appears deceptively refreshing and inviting canbe full of microscopic parasites waiting to make you part ofthe food chain.(Keep in mind one of the single mostimportant rules in life: To survive and thrive, you have toremain at the top of the food chain.)If you are an outdoor enthusiast, adventure traveler, or a tripleader, there are a few essential principles that you need tounderstand in order to properly take care of yourself or yourclientele. Not only do you and/or your charges need to havea good time and perhaps learn a great deal, you also need togo home as you've arrived without carrying any alien speciesin their gut.Having been at the top of the food chain,everyone needs to return home still on top of the food chain,not part of it.There are a wide variety of parasitic organisms around theworld that can be spread by eating contaminated food, beingbitten by blood-sucking insects, or even from walking barefooton the ground.But, by far, one of the easiest and mostcommon ways to become sick is from drinking contaminatedwater.A parasite is an organism that lives in or on another livingorganism at that other organism's expense. Parasites thatproliferate in the small and large intestine are referred to as\"entericpathogens\"(\"enteric\"forintheboweland\"pathogens\" for disease-causing). A simple example isGiardia lamblia, a very common parasitic protozoa found infresh water throughout the tropical, subtropical, and temperateparts of the world.If you drink Giardia-inhabited water, youwill open the door to this parasite. Taking up residence inyour small intestine, the \"bug\" will begin to multiply whileconsuming nutrients from your bowel. Eventually this willresult in diarrhea and abdominal pain.Common parasites, besides Giardia lamblia (giardiasis), thatcan be obtained from drinking water are Entamoeba histolytica(amoebicdysentery),Hepatitis A virus(hepatitis),andCryptosporidium, to name just a few. What all of these havein common is their ability to ruin someone's trip by causinggastrointestinalupset,abdominalcramps,anddiarrhea.Individuals (and possibly their travel companions) are notgoing to enjoy their travel experience if they cannot venturemore than 10 feet from the bathroom. While it is not your responsibility to be able to describe and identify the parasiticorganism in a stool sample,it is your responsibility as atraveler or adventurer to know how to prevent this fromoccurring.\"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure\"... and tworolls of toilet paper.Prevention of water-related illness anddisease is achieved by understanding what is safe to drink andnot to drink and knowing how to produce safe potable water. We first need to dispense with several myths and state thefacts about drinking water:Myth #1Crystal clear water is generally safe to drink.Fact:Cool, clear water may appear pure and potable, butit can still contain a variety of microscopic protozoaand other parasites that will cause disease.Myth #2 Freezing will kill these organisms.Fact:Giardia, for example, can survive frozen in icewaiting to be dropped in your margarita, for up to90 days. These microscopic organisms, which areactually protozoa, exist in two states: one, themotile form (a trophozoite) that proliferates in thebowel and causes the symptoms of the disease; theother, a cyst form, that the organism assumes whenit finds itself in a hostile environment, such as coldor dry or acid like the environs of your stomach.The cyst form, the form in which the disease isusually spread from one person to another, protectsthe organism from freezing thus, its ability tosurvive in an ice cube, in your margarita, and inyour stomach.Passing unscathed through yourstomach, giardia will change back into motileform, the trophozoite, and proliferate, causing thedisease giardiasis.Myth #3 Drinking alcohol, ethanol, will kill most of theseorganisms.Fact:Just as with freezing, the cyst form of the organismprotects the organism from the toxic effects of thealcohol. So, adding tequila to everything you drinkwill not sterilize the fluid or protect you from theorganism.Myth #4 Bottled water and drinks are always safe toconsume.Fact:Bottled and canned carbonated beverages arepasteurized to preserve them and increase their shelflives.As such, these beverages are, therefore,potable. Bottled water, with the factory seal still inplace, is also safe. But, be sure to check the factoryseal; if it is broken, the bottle may have beenrefilled with suspect water. (Milk and other dairyproductsvaryinpotabilitybecauseofthedifferences in pasteurization processes.)Myth #5 Water served in a \"good\" restaurant or in a five-star hotel is always safe.Fact:The sanitation standards vary around the world, andmay not be up to our American standards. Evenbeverages or ice served in the most expensiveeateries may not be safe.Water is not something that you can go without for very long,especially in the hot tropical environment where the averageindividual will lose up to 1 liter of fluid per hour sweating ina effort to stay cool. Individuals, trip leaders, and internationalguides not only need to understand what is safe and what isnot safe to consume, but, more importantly they must knowhow to make pure drinking water and potentially how to makea lot of it.There are three effective ways to purify water: boiling,filtering, or chemical disinfection. Each method can be usedin remote and wilderness settings, and each method iscompletely effective, if done properly. Which method is useddepends upon the setting and resources available.BOILING: At sea level water reaches a rolling boil at 212degrees. There is not a single disease-producing organism onthe planet earth that can survive that temperature. So, bysimply bringing water to a rolling boil, the water is now safeto consume.The problems with boiling water are that itrequires a source of heat; it is hard to do in large quantities;boiling is time-consuming; and, probably the biggest issue, itis now in the form of hot water, which is great for tea andcoffee in cooler climes, but may not be very refreshing in theheat of the tropics. If the now sterile water is allowed to standand cool, it must be kept covered to protect it from possiblecontamination. This method will work extremely well on anysource of fresh water, but boiling requires the right equipmentlike a container in which to boil the water and a significantsource of heat. Having a large enough container or adequatefuel makes this method very difficult with groups that requirea lot of potable water.One of the tricks, though, with preventive medicine is gettingpeople to take certain measures. Steps or procedures have tobe relatively quick and easy to do. Both filtering and chemicaldisinfection are quicker and easier than boiling, and, if doneproperly, just as effective.FILTERING: Filters contain small holes known as pores thatare so small that the dimension of the hole is measured inmicrons.(A micron is 1/1000th of a millimeter or onemillionth of a meter.) Water is able to flow through even thesmallest pore, but the invisible enteric pathogens, the viruses,bacteria, and protozoa, that cause disease have dimension. Ifthe pore is small enough, a pathogen will not be able to getthrough.362 SEPTMDER/OCTODER 1e97 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER A pump filter, the most common type of system used inportable water purification systems (another type is gravity-feed), works by drawing in the bad water, forcing it througha filter to remove the pathogens, and producing potable water.There are many different commercial filtration systems, mostof which work as advertised. Their differences and drawbacksare ease of operation, taste of filtered water, and expense.Several are efficient, easy to use, and their safety is well-documented.The Swiss-made Katadyne filter, for example, has been aroundfor years.Itconsists of a 0.2 micron ceramic filterimpregnated with silverto decrease bacterial growth. Thissystem is very effective and time-tested, does not add any tasteto the water, and the filter is easily cleaned. But, the Katadynesystem itself is relatively expensive; replacement filters arepricey; and it can be laborious to use with large groups.The Pur company makes a variety of effective filters. Forgroups, their Explorer is one of the finest on the market. Ituses the technology of a 1 micron filter impregnated with aniodine resin to kill any small viruses or other pathogens thatmade it through the pores. The system produces biologicallysafe water with a minimal effort, but it can add a slight iodinetaste to the water.Several other very effective filtration systems include theSweet Water, MSR Waterworks, Basic Designs Ceramic Filters,and General Ecology First Need. Which system is selecteddepends upon the specific needs and the group size. Theimportant point is not which filter is chosen, but rather, that asystem of water purification is consistently used.CHEMICAL DISINFECTION: Chemical disinfection worksby adding a compound to the water that will kill all thepathogens in the water but which is relatively harmless to usif used properly.Chemicals typically used are iodine andchlorine.To be used properly the concentration of these\"cidal\" or killing compounds must be great enough to kill thedisease- producing organism but low enough to be harmless toUS.Iodine and chlorine are both very effective, easy to use, andavailable in pre-measured, pre-packaged, user-friendly systems.Their primary disadvantage is taste: both will add a taste to thewater, but this tainted taste is easily masked with anotherflavor (lemonade crystals, for example). The trick with thesecompounds is that they have to be used properly. First, theymust be used in correct concentrations and, second and mostimportantly, they have to have a sufficient \"contact time\" forthe toxins to work and destroy all the pathogens.Easy-to-use, commercially available products are Potable Aguaiodine tablets and Polar Pure iodine crystals, both designed tobe added directly to 1 liter of water. These may be difficult touse for large volumes of water, such as for a group, butindividuals should carry them to produce their own potablewater supply when necessary. For groups it may be mosteffectiveto use concentrated iodine or chlorine bleach37solutions. Both are safe, but it is critical to know exactly howmuch to add to be effective without being toxic to humans.As stated earlier,which system or technique is used is notimportant, as they are all very effective. What does matter isthat the traveler, trip leader, or guide assumes the responsibilityof assuring that ample, safe, potable water is available. Anindividual becoming ill or returning home with entericpathogens will not have fond memories of the trip and mayhave ruined the experience for others in the group. Anindividual coming back from a guided trip with a waterborneillness is additionally evidence of a leadership problem andpresents a liability exposure. As an individual you have a dutyto protect yourself; as a trip leader or guide, you have a dutyto protect your clients.So, despite the availability or lack ofavailability of this \"elixir of life,\" the ultimate challenge fortravelers or trippers with water is ensuring that the watersupply is adequate and safe.Editor's Note: Franklin R. Hubbell, DO is the ExecutiveDirector of SOLO, a school that offers a variety of intensiveprograms to train individuals in the applications of wildernessemergency medicine, leadership, and emergency care inremote settings including specific courses for international tripleaders and guides.He is also the Vice President ofGEOMED,a Conover, M.D., FAC'EP,WEMSI Medical DirectorAdapted in part, with permission, from materials of theWilderness EMS InstituteSeveral years ago, I was involved in a summer search inVirginia - hot and sweaty.I can still distinctly remember alarge group of us stopping for dinner at the Lord Hardwicke'son US 29 just north of the University of Virginia for dinner.While we were eating dinner, I gradually started feeling a painin the back left part of my scalp. I scratched at it and seemedto accidentally pick off a little scab didn't think much aboutit; but about halfway through dinner, I started feeling warmthand swelling in the back left part of my neck - and when I feltmy neck, I could tell there was some swelling in the lymphnodes there. Hmm, I said to myself, must be getting somecellulitis (skin infection) from that scratch on my head. I wentout to my car and got some bacitracin ointment for the placeon my scalp, and some antibiotics (I had some samples ofsomething called Duricef similar to the common antibioticKeflex) and started taking them. Over the next week or twothe lump on my scalp was slow to heal, and the lymph nodesin my neck continued to be swollen and warm - they didn'tactually go away until I gave up on the Duricef (and startedtaking another antibiotic called doxycycline). It was only whenI sat down to work on an earlier version of this article that Isuddenly stopped, hit myself in the head with the palm of my 3 SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER 1997 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER hand, and said out loud (to myself), \"You idiot, this wasn'tcellulitis, this was !And if you'd figured this outin beginning, you'd have started doxycycline instead of Duricef(and wouldn't have had a pain in the neck for two weeks!\" Iwill say that it made tick-borne disease much more interestingto me. What did I have? Read the information below and seeif you can figure it out.Many diseases may be spread by ticks. For instance, NorthAsian tick typhus, Mediterranean spotted fever (Mediterraneanarea, South Africa, and India), and Queensland tick typhus(Australia) are all similar to Rocky Mountain Spotted fever,and transmitted by tick bites. In the U.S., relapsing fever isfound on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon and some cavesin the Southwest.However, our discussion here will belimited to those tick-related problems that are widespread inNorth America, and thus likely to be encountered by thosedoing wilderness hiking, especially in the Appalachians:RMSF, Lyme Disease, tularemia, and tick paralysis. The onlyway to get Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, Lyme Disease, orTick Paralysis is from a tick bite; by avoiding tick bites, youcan avoid these diseases.Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF)RMSF Background: Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever is aninfectious disease transmitted by the bite of certain ticks. It iscaused by Rickettsia rickettsii, and is transmitted to humansonly by the bite of certain ticks. Contrary to its name, RockyMountain Spotted Fever is much more common in Virginiaand North Carolina than in the Rocky Mountains, although itis found throughout most of the U.S. Ninety-five percent ofcases occur in the warm months between April and September(when people and ticks are in the woods together). RMSF ismost common in children and wilderness travelers. In 1990,651 cases were reported in the U.S.RMSF Course: The normal course for RMSF is about twoweeks of severe illness. It is, as the name would lead you tosuspect, characterized by a spotty macular rash - (Macularrefers to a rash in which you can see small spots, but cannotfeel them as compared to papular, which is a rash withpalpable bumps.) - a non-palpable, red rash* and high fever.However, the classical syndrome is not all that common:sudden onset, high spiking fever, severe headache, myalgias(muscle aches), weakness, and a rash beginning on theextremities, including palms and soles, then spreading to thetrunk. Often, the pictureis confused by gradual onset,nonproductivecough,nausea,vomiting,diarrhea,andabdominal pain; a significant minority of patients never noticea rash. Anyone with sudden fever and rash should get medicalevaluation without delay, as RMSF and related diseases maybe fatal.Recognition of RMSF: RMSF is not likely to occur while ahiker is still in the wilderness: the incubation period is twodays to a week. However, those involved in outdoor recreation,especially in the mid-Appalachian region, are more likely tocontract the disease than others. If someone who was in themid-Appalachian woods a week ago develops symptoms ofRMSF, especially someone who had a tick attached, get himor her to a physician immediately, and mention the possibilityof RMSF.Treatment of RMSF: If a hiker may have RMSF, and it willbe a long time until he or she will reach medical care, theantibiotics tetracycline or doxycycline are the usual treatment.DON'Tgivesulfonamideantibioticssuchassulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (e.g., they mightmake the disease worse.Lyme DiseaseLyme Disease Background: Lyme Disease is yet anotherinfectious disease transmitted by the bite of certain ticks.Named after the Connecticut town where the disease was firstdiscovered, it is the most common tick-borne infection. In1989, 8333 cases were reported. It is caused by bacteria calledspirochetes (because they look like little spirals under themicroscope), Borrelia burgdorferi. The immature deer ticks(Ixodes species) that transmit Lyme Disease are very commonin some areas; it is said that well-tended lawns in WestchesterCounty, NY, average one infected tick per square meter. Theseticks are small, about the size of a pencil point. Like RMSF,Lyme Disease is transmitted by the bite of a particular kind oftick. Unlike RMSF, it has a longer and more drawn-out course,and can cause chronic disease.Lyme Disease Geographic Area: Lyme disease centers in thethe mid-Appalachians and is found primarily in the Northeastand northern Midwest of North America and as far south asNorth Carolina. It is also found along the Pacific coast as farnorth as British Columbia. Lyme Disease is also found in Asia,Scandinavia, and Europe. Characteristics of Lyme Disease: Lyme Disease occurs invarying forms, but can be usefully divided into early and latephases. The early phase includes two stages: first,local infection at the bite (the \"Erythema Migrans\" rash), andsecond, symptoms that spread throughout the body. The latephase involves persistent disease, primarily in skin, heart,joints, or central nervous system. Only a fraction of those whodevelop the first phase go on to develop the second phase.Some people may develop persistent disease without evernoticing the symptoms of the first phase. Some people maydevelop an infection without noticing any symptoms.!! 2The early phase includes localized infection. Erythema Migransis a slowly-spreading circular red rash that is a sign of LymeDisease.This red circular rash starts at the tick-bite andspreads over days to weeks. The ring-like rash is usually aboutthree inches across at the two week point.\"During the early phase, some people will develop symptomsof widespread infection. A rash similar to Erythema Migransmay appear in many places on the skin. Intermittent symptomssimilar to encephalitis (brain infection) or meningitis are SEPTEMBER/OCTOEM M738INOLDERKESS EED:COXE KEINSLETTER common: headache and a stiff neck. The patient may alsodevelop malaise, fatigue, and muscle and joint pains. In mostpeople, these symptoms go away in about three to four weeks.The late phase is characterized by persistent infection. In theU.S., about a fifth of those with infection will have persistentdisease. Of these, over half will have a form of arthritis(inflammation of the joints) similar to rheumatoid, which ischaracterized by hot, red, swollen joints, especially the knees.(This was how the disease was discovered -- mothers near thetown of Lyme, Connecticut pestered public health officials tofind out why so many of their kids were getting what lookedto all the world like rheumatoid arthritis.) Others will haveencephalitis and meningitis, similar to the early phase, and mayhave paralysis of various cranial or peripheral nerves. Someproblems (in less than a tenth of those with persistent disease)are thought to be autoimmune abnormalities of conduction ofelectrical impulses through the heart (called heart blocks - anabnormalityofthecardiacconductionsystem)andinflammation of the heart muscle.Diagnosing and Treating Lyme Disease: If a member of asearch and rescue team (or anyone, for that matter), especiallysomeone who has been bitten by a tick, develops a rash similarto Erythema Migrans, or develops arthritis or heart block at ayoung age, that person should see a physician for possibleLyme disease. 3 Blood tests for Lyme disease, while available,are not highly reliable; therefore, a careful history and physicalexam are very important in the diagnosis of Lyme disease.Lyme disease is readily treatable with antibiotics, especiallywhen detected early.TularemiaTularemiaiscaused bythegram-negativebacteriumFrancisella tularensis. Tularemia is traditionally thought of asa disease of rabbits, but is actually carried by many wildmammals. It can be transmitted by ticks, and it can causeserious disease in humans. If infection occurs through the skin,ulceroglandular tularemia develops in about two days. The bite(or other site of inoculation) forms an abscess and thenulcerates. The patient develops a high fever and enlargedlymph nodes (Small subcutaneous bumps that are found inmany places, especially in the neck, armpit, and groin whichlie along lymphatic vessels. Lymph nodes are \"factories\" forcertain kinds of white blood cells and enlarge in response toinfections.). Severe headache and enlargement of the liver andspleen are common. Variant forms of tularemia involve theeyes or lungs, sometimes with few other symptoms. In 1990,152 cases were reported in the U.S.Thereisnoparticularfieldtreatmentfortularemia.Tetracycline or doxycycline, if available, may be effective,though neither is as effective as the intramuscular streptomycinthat is used in a hospital. 539Tick ParalysisTick Paralysis is a rare form of ascending paralysis (paralysisthat starts at the feet and works its way upward). It can befatal as the paralysis can reach as high as the muscles ofrespiration, causing respiratory arrest requiring someone tointervene with artificial respiration. This disease is caused bya chemical secreted in the saliva of one particular kind offemale tick. If you find and remove the tick, the paralysisdisappears within a day or so. 6So, as I think you can now tell, I must have had a tick bite onthe head, and contracted ulceroglandular tularemia. I'm justglad it wasn't Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever! The same yearI got tularemia, a fellow member of the Allegheny MountainRescue Group here in Pittsburgh got RMSF during a trainingsession along the Laurel Highlands Trail in southwesternPennsylvania. He had a high fever, shaking chills, and feltmiserable for several days, until the antibiotic finally startedclearing out the infection.Prevention is key but that's a topic for another article. So, fornow, let me just say \"be careful out there!\"GlossaryArthritis: Inflammation of the joints.Autoimmune:When you develop an allergic (immune)reaction against part of your own body.

DEATH IN THE BACKCOUNTRYBy William Kane, WEMTRecently, while watching a wildly moulaged mock backcountryrescue at SOLO, my son Nick asked, \"Dad, does anybody ever'die' at SOLO?\" \"No, son,\" I replied, \"We always find a wayto help them pull through.\" Unfortunately, as realistic as wemight try to make our training, this is one place where wecreate an artificial world. As the events of the past summerhere in the White Mountains have reminded us, sometimes wecan do everything right, but rescuers and people will still die;sometimes help just can't get there in time, and even if helparrived sooner not enough could have been done to save them.In these sad and difficult circumstances, rescuers will have todeal with the consequences of a death in the backcountry,consequences that may go far beyond the time it takes to geta body to the trailhead.It is important to understand the three basic situations in whichwe, as rescuers, may have to deal with a death. The firstsituation is to be called to the scene to help remove the bodyof someone who is obviously, or believed to be dead. Iintentionally add the word \"believed\" because the nature ofcold injuries is such that someone who by circumstance, orquick appearance, is believed to be dead, but who instead ishypothermic, is actually a patient capable of recovery. Mostof the time, however, when we are called to the scene of abackcountry death is just that a cold, frozen body, perhapswith gross injury, perhaps with multiple injuries, or perhapsunscathed.[Pleasenotethattherearecertainlegalrequirements in the event of an unexpected death of this sortthat must be acknowledged, and notification of your state'sappropriate authorities (Fish and Game in New Hampshire, theWarden Serve in Maine, National Park Rangers, or State Parkofficials, etc.), is not only an absolute necessity, but these folkscan be a great help in handling situations that we as rescuerscan't, shouldn't, and don't want to handle.]These cases generally present us with two challenges, the fastis getting and keeping the number of folks we need to quicklyand safely carry the body out; the second, and most difficult,is the handling of the body at the scene. The problem here isthat no matter how much time and energy people will sacrificeto help a gravely injured person, for a variety of reasons thereis less enthusiasm for carrying out a body. A suggestion inthis situation would be to focus rescuers on the family andfriends of the deceased, who will be helped immeasurably bythe opportunity to begin bringing closure with the death oncethe body of their loved one has been returned.The second problem is the handling of the body at the sceneoften a grisly, disturbing job. The recommendation here is tolimit physical and visual exposure of the body to a fewindividuals, one of whom should probably be one of theauthorities mentioned earlier. These few will perform thenecessary, if seemingly perfunctory, assessment and beforeplacing the body in a body-bag. Only then should the balanceof the rescuers be exposed to the scene in order to completethe removal. Regardless of whether someone had exposure tothe body or not, even in this scenario some of the rescuersmay need the benefit of Critical Incident Stress Debriefing(CISD), as we'll discuss later.The second situation in which rescuers may be exposed todeath in the backcountry is in the demise of someone forwhom they're already providing care.Rescuers haveresponded to the need for help; they rendered appropriate care;but during the rescue or the evacuation, the person died. Asthe result of our standard of care, CPR will very often havebeen performed as the last attempt to save the person. Thevery difficult task of having to stop CPR after a half hour ormore has left the team feeling at best deflated and empty, atworst devastated. Many new folks on a backcountry team,even those with lots of street experience, have never been ina situation where they just stop resuscitating especiallyoutside a hospital emergency room where the very appearancesof docs and nurses and machines gives them comfort thateverything possible was done. In the mountains, there usuallyare not docs, nurses, machines or drugs. When someone inour care dies, doubt, guilt, discouragement, and despair cantrouble us deeply. Although it has been said before, now isthe time to remind ourselves that we can do everything rightas rescuers, but people can still hurt themselves so badly, orget so sick that they can't be helped, even by definitive care,at the best hospitals.The third circumstance, and the one most likely to disturb us,is when we and our patient realize that they are not going tosurvive.They are conscious and alert, but their injuries or 6 SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER 99974 0WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER illness are so serious, or the evacuation is delayed by theenvironment or terrain that you are with them when therealization that death is inevitable hits both of you. An evenworse scenario is having to leave this person, perhaps to getmore help, perhaps to save yourself, knowing that they may,or most likely will die in your absence. Staying helps no onein this situation, but as you can imagine, this indeed, will bethe most difficult backcountry situation you're likely toencounter.If you are to remain with someone during anevacuation, you must be prepared to understand the emotionsthey will likely display, as the situation will place tremendousemotional stress on you as well. The Kubler-Ross model givesan idea of what to expect...typically the willprogress this: this cycle, thepatient may place blame or show great anger in the situation,at you and at others.It's important to understand that yousimply listen, support, and understand; you don't argue, debate,or explain... what they need is someone to listen, and makethem as comfortable as possible. Afterward,it'sveryimportant for anyone who was part of this scenario to onceagain consider availing themselves of a CISD. The impact ofthe above situation is unpredictable. One rescuer may get overit quickly; or another may be so affected that it could quietlybe devastating to themthe event permeating every aspectof their lives. Once a life has been lost to this tragic rescuesituation, we must find a way to ensure that all those involvedhave the opportunity to \"unload\" any baggage they carry awayfrom the situation, or it may continue to diminish and damagethe lives of the rescuers.The mention of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) outsideof the generally accepted battlefield situations, challenges us tounderstand that the nature of PTSD is such that it is just aslikely to occur to public safety personnel who must deal withemotionallychallenging,stressfulsituationseveryday.Military personnel, police, firefighters, and EMS folks areoften routinely screened for signs of PTSD, especially ifthey're been involved in a situation which potentially exposedthem to extraordinary emotional stress. Although no one ishooting at backcountry rescuers and despite the fact thatthey're often in beautiful country, this group can suffer thesame troubling effects of PTSD. In fact, a few years ago aftera particularly difficult rescue, a close friend and fellowmember of the Mountain Rescue Service (MRS) with years ofspecial military training remarked that working on the MRS,especially in winter, reminded him very much of the samestress he felt when in combat. I was dubious at first, becauseeven through I'd had lots of mountain rescue experience, I hadnever been in the military. However, as I looked more closelyat the parallels,Irealized he was right, that perhaps ourbackcountry teams occasionally needed the ability to \"debrief'a difficult rescue, with something a little more guided andprofessional than a couple of beers to dull the feeling.The risk of denying the need for help in dealing with this kindof emotional stress carries with it a whole host of symptomsincluding the following: guilt; loss of interest in work, play, or 4 isex; loss of appetite; loss of temper; difficulty sleeping;withdrawal; depression; increased use of drugs/alcohol; and soon. Looking at this list, one's first impression could easily be,\"I know lots of folks on our team with some of those traits,\"or \"I have lots of those traits,\" and you wouldn't be wrong.Any of us in our day-to-day lives may display many of thoseactions, symptoms, or emotions. However, it is when webegin to exhibit many of them, more frequently that theybecome a problem to the point where they begin to control ourlives.Of course, to correctly diagnose anyone as having aclinically, recognizable psychological problem, they must seea psychiatrist.Before there are clinically significant signs ofPTSD, it would be better to begin the emotional healingprocess. That is where the Critical Incident Stress Debriefing(CISD) can be invaluable. CISD is a voluntary, informal, butprofessionally run process through which personnel who havebeen exposed to extraordinary emotional stress are given theopportunity to discuss openly... what happened, why what wasdone was done, what else could have been done, who didwhat, and basically to go through all the \"what-ifs\" that thosewho were involved might have. It is important to realize thatoften emotions run high, people feel guilt, sometimes accuse,and often second-guess themselves and others, all of which isbetter said there during a CISD than outside, and all of whichmay mean that there is a need to hold some subsequentmeetings.Although I cannot adequately discuss the intricacies of the-CISD process within the scope of this article, I feel it isimportant to acknowledge the kind of emotional stress and\"baggage\" that dealing with a death in the backcountry canhave on rescuers and to try and ensure that there is adebriefing mechanism in place, so that these tragic situationsdon't continue to claim victims in the future. As humanbeings, rescuers deserve the fullest, most emotionally stablelives possibleas members of the rescuer community, theyare needed to be there for all those people in the future whowill need their support, whose cries for help they'll answer,and whose lives will be made better by the rescuers' efforts.

Newton, WEMTEditor's Note: Many of our readers call and write to WMNseeking information on where they can put their wildernessmedicine skills to work. This article takes an in-depth look atone of the\"non-traditional\" worksites where wildernessmedical skills can not only be utilized, but can be thedifference in healthcare.\"One cannot simultaneously assert science anddogma, one cannot travel half the road under theformer banner, in the hope of taking up the latter,too, at the middle of the march. Science, onceembraced, will conquer the whole.\" (Flexner 161).This comment, circa1910, echoes the once-widespreadsentiment that science must know no morality, only truth. Italso upholds the opinion that science in itself is strong enoughtoconfront any problemsorquestionsthatitraises.Historically, the position that good science should excludeemotion and principle has been acceptable, responsiblerevered, even, in some circles. In light of the spirit and scopeof the scientific advances of the twentieth century, however,most members of academic and applied scientific communitiesalike, as well as the general public, have come to abandon theconcern over conflating truth (represented by \"pure\" science)with belief (represented by dogma or politics). In its placenow stands the assertion that science, too, must have aconscience.Among the leaders of this modern generation of scientists arethose who have aimed to apply the tools of medicine to thequest to advance basic human rights. Many of them havecome together in organizations that recognize the comminglingof morality and discovery, that believe in breaking down themyth that science and politics, if they are to safely coexist,must encompass discrete realms.BEST COPY AVAILABLE 4:3GROUND BREAKING AND EARLY HISTORYMedecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) has helped to set the standardamong such organizations since its founding. Also known inEnglish-speakingcountriesasDoctors Without Borders(DWB), MSF is an international humanitarian medical reliefagency that was born in France during the winter of 1971.The original MSF was established by two groups of doctorsdriven by their frustrations with international aid programs.Each group had come to believe that provision of medical carewas being overshadowed by too much regard for nationalborders- that help was being hindered by politics, rendering thepowerful tools of medicine less effective to deal with the crisesthey were trying to confront.One of these two groups came from projects with the FrenchRed Cross. Among its members were 50 doctors who hadbeen in Africa to witness portions of The Republic of Biafra'sattempted secession from Nigeria and the ensuing civil warspanning the years from 1967 to 1970. The war ended on 15January1970withNigerianvictory,yetInternationalCommittee of the Red Cross (ICRC) regulations forbade ICRCstaff from publicly denouncing the ethnic genocide thatoccurred along with the fighting, killing some one millionpeople.In condemnation of the silence imposed by ICRCregulations, a group of physicians came together to speak outagainsttheBiafrangenocide and formedtheGrouped'Intervention Medical et Chirurgical d'Urgence (GIMCU) in1970.Coinciding with the formation of GIMCU was the attention ofanother group of French physicians to a problem in a differentpart of the world.This second contingent grew concernedabout those who had lost homes and loved ones to a majortidal wave in eastern Pakistan (now Bangladesh). Urged on byreporting in television images and by editorials in the medical journal Tonus, they came together in a team known as SecoursMedical Francais (SMF) to offer help to people affected bythis tragedy.In the wake of these two crises one a human-imposeddevastation, the other a natural disaster- the merging ofGIMCU and SMF on 20 December 1971 created the basis forthe original MSF. The conditions of the founding of MSF,based upon the need created by these two divergent kinds ofcatastrophes, continues to shape the nature of MSF missions.MSF does not discriminate among victims of natural and man-made disasters; it offers aid in times of troubles of incrediblyvaried origin.The targets of MSF projects have includedpopulations in crises precipitated by earthquakes, hurricanes,droughts, famines, and disease epidemics, as well as both intra-and international conflicts.Just as the founding of MSF was driven by the two verydifferent types of crises in Biafra and eastern Pakistan, themotivations of MSF's early volunteers were varied and diverse.Some traveled to offer aid driven by religious or spiritualconvictions. Others sought adventure in the tastes and smellsand images of exoticized locales. Most common, perhaps,were those who sought authenticity in the medicine ofdesperation; they longed to escape routine medicine and thepredictable ailments of residents of a developed society, withthe expectation that medicine in undeveloped countries wouldbe more challenging, more stimulating, more \"real\" somehow.The basic fact that MSF began in France during the early1970s is as revealing as are the details of the foundingthemselves.Some observersspeculatedthatFrance,preoccupied with its colonial past, felt an obligation to provideassistance to undeveloped countries to assuage its guiltynational conscience over possible historical wrongdoings. Thisfactor, coupled with so many physicians' frustrations incombating the minor and \"imaginary\" illnesses so predominantin their comfortable European communities, meant that thecountry and its medical professionals were primed for amedical and volunteer outlet such as MSF would provide.At the same time as these frustrations in France were rising, acommunications revolution had begun, causing the world tofeel smaller and smaller.According to Rony Brauman, 12-year president of MSF through June 1994, \"The instantaneousvisibility of disasters and conflicts on television [in the 1970s]made it less and less acceptable either to do nothing or to offeronly a confused effort at emergency assistance.\" Not onlycould one receive and disseminate information more quicklythan ever before; those willing to provide assistance could nowlaunch an essentially instantaneous response due to theconcurrent democratization of air transport and improvementsin transportation facilities.Still, MSF was not an immediate success. During its first fiveyears, the organization provided a pool of doctors willing tovolunteer their skills in time of crisis, but had not yetdeveloped any real structure within which to mobilize itsresources.It tended to rely on mutual missions with other 2agencies, as it lacked the funds operating on a total budgetof only a few hundred thousand francs- to coordinate and todispatch independent efforts.Before it could be a medical force in fact as well as in name,MSF needed time to develop its resources and to define itsniche. Until the late 1970s, the reputation of MSF resoundedlouder than its actual successes. In the public eye, MSF hadgrown beyond its image as a group of amateur adventurers and\"cowboy doctors\"; its volunteers knew, however, that it hadmerely become a superficially revered but frustratingly small-scale contingent of well-meaning medical professionals. It hadyet to make the leap toward becoming a true healing force inundeveloped nations.IDENTITY FORMATION AND THE TRANSITION TOPRESENT-DAY MSFThe surge of refugee camps in the late 1970s was the singularprecipitating factor that allowed MSF to create a self-identityand to form a primary intervention strategy. The world'srefugee population of approximately 2.7 million had been arelative constant between the time of MSF's formation and themid-1970s. Suddenly, between 1976 and 1979, this populationdoubled; then, between 1979 and 1982, it doubled again. Anincreasing incidence of conflict in the southern hemisphere,fueled by decolonization and the ensuing reemergence ofethnic rivalries and intranational antagonisms, caused thisremarkable-growth. By the late 1970s, MSF was ready to,respond; it had at its disposal a great supply of enthusiastic andable French babyboom doctors none of whom felt theconstraints of post-study debt so common today in the UnitedStates, and many of whom had gotten a taste of internationalmedicine during military service and wanted more.During the course of the past quarter-century, MSF hasevolved while the tone of world politics has changed. Oneresponsibility that its founders doubtless could not haveforeseen is MSF's current actions in Europe; while MSF beganas an effort to provide assistance to needy undevelopednations, its missions now reach out at even the shortestdistance into its own backyard. Led by its Holland branch,for example, MSF has undertaken an ambitious AIDSprevention program in Moscow, comprised of healthcare andprevention-driven education surrounding issues of drug use andsafer sex. MSF has stepped in to provide assistance duringthis summer's floods in Poland and during recent conflicts ineastern Europe, including those in Bosnia-Herzegovina andother regions of the former Yugoslavia. MSF has evenmobilized medical response in western Europe to recent crisesin its homeland of France and in Spain.A subtle factor that has distinguished MSF from otherinternational aid organizations throughout its history has beenits recognition of the role of the media in bringing quiet crisesof remote populations to the attention of the general public,and its willingness to use the media to help spread its message.While MSF began as a small contingent of physicians travelingon occasional missions to remote and obscure locales, publicity44MOVEMBERIDECEMBER 9 V37 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER has transformed it into a household name. This attention hasstemmed both from MSF members' own drive to bear witnessand to bring their experiences into public view and from itsinclusion in coverage of crises by international media.Furthermore, its current advisory board is composed not onlyof physicians, but also of celebrities such as writer MayaAngelou, actress Candice Bergen, CNN consultant GarrickUtley, and Dow Jones Senior Vice President Jim Ottaway, Jr.,all of whose individual successes have helped to gamerwidespread attention and respect for MSF through theiraffiliation with it.MSF DISTINCTIONS: FIRSTS, LASTS, AND ONLIESMSF was the first nonmilitary and nongovernmental agency inthe modem world to specialize in emergency medicine.Indeed, even throughout its more recent history, the tale ofMSF reads like a list of superlatives and singularities. Amongits \"firsts\" were the 1997 location of the missing Rwandanrefugees in Tingi Tingi; MSF teams were the first to find therefugees and to brief the Security Council on the situation inZaire.From its humble beginnings, MSF has grown to a staff of12,000 at six independent chapters in Belgium, Holland,Switzerland,Luxembourg,Spain,and Germany,whilemaintaining its home base in France. Today's MSF sendsmore than 2,000 Volunteers of nearly 50 nationalities into thefield each year, and has worked with upwards of 15,000volunteers in the course of its twenty-six-year history. Itsoffices, which serve primarily tofund-raise,torecruitvolunteers, and to increase public awareness of its work, arespread throughout 19 countries, including branches in the citiesof New York, Los Angeles, Hong Kong, and Tokyo. Itsmissions reach roughly 80 countries annually.Having originated with the seeds of frustration and a fewhundred thousand francs, MSF now boasts an annual budget ofover US $160 million and the claim to being the world'slargestprivateinternational medicalrelieforganization.Approximately two-thirds of its current income is in the formof private donations; institutional donors account for one-thirdof its funding. Much recent growth has come in part fromMSF's new partnerships with major institutional financiers,such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,the European Economic Community, the United States Agencyfor International Development, and the United States Bureaufor Refugee Programs.MSF also boasts a stunning and responsibility-laden listof \"onlies.\" During the 1991 civil war in Somalia, MSF wasthe only medical agency providing assistance in Mogadishu.During the 1995 deterioration of Yugoslavia, MSF was theonly relief agency to witness the fall of Srebrenica. During thecurrent sleeping sickness (trypanosomiasis) epidemic broughtabout by the Angolan civil war, MSF has been providing theonly treatment available in the northern province of KwanzaNorte.MSF isthe only international nongovernmental45organization presently working in Iran to help the residentsrespond to the 7.1 Richer-scale earthquake of May 1997.Furthermore, MSF members have often prided themselves ontheir\" lasts.\"In mid-July 1997, when many foreign relieforganizations had left Cambodia in the wake of the militarycoup, MSF chose to stay in order to help provide fuel and firstaid at local hospitals. On 15 October 1997, MSF was the lastinternational organization to leave war-torn Brazzaville, thecapital of Congo Republic, when its teams were physicallyunable to cross the Congo River and thus to gain access to thecountry due to the Democratic Republic of Congo's borderclosure. The MSF teams, however, were not easily deterredfrom their mission; they returned to resume staffing basic carefacilities as soon as the border was reopened, just six daysafter being turned away.POLITICS AND APOLITICS OF DANGERAND INJUSTICEBut the \"firsts\" and other achievements of MSF havebeen special, MSF provides humanitarian assistance guided byscience in the form of medicine, but also realizes that sciencealone will not \"conquer the whole,\" no matter how its tenetsare embraced.The aid in the act of bandaging, ofperforming surgery, of helping a community purify its solewater source can begin to heal, but it does not offer cure forall those who suffer and it does not prevent problems fromrecurring. To this end, MSF members also bear witness tohuman rights violations that they observe.Since MSF was founded in part as a response to the ICRC'sunwillingness to speak out against the Biafran genocide, itseems inevitable that the organization would be a vocal partyin informing the world of any injustices that its memberswitness directly. Although MSF underwent an initial period ofrelative quiet during its first few years of operation under thebelief that \"no state would accept the presence of overlygarrulous doctors on its territory\" and that silence should be \"asymbol of MSF's apolitical stance,\" it is now an outspokenpresence in international affairs. The DWB World Wide Webhomepage asserts that \"when medical assistance is not enoughto save lives, Doctors Without Borders will speak out againsthuman rights abuses and violations of humanitarian law that itsteams witness in the course of providing medical relief.\" Still,\"MSF does not systematically denounce all countries violatinghuman rights;\" it only gets involved with causes that its teammembers witness directly, and with human rights abuses thatdetract from the power of its teams to offer medical care toneedy patients.MSF members strive to prevent political influences fromdictating how they conduct their operations during a mission,and MSF refuses aid from blatantly political sources such asthe French government. MSF does not, however, ignore thepolitical implications in its choices of where to undertakemissions, and its members are vociferous and outspokenagainst human rights violations that they witness. This is animportant distinction: MSF's relief efforts are guided by 3 MOVEUSER/DECEMBER 927 WOLDERNESS MEEMONE NEWSLETTER universal standards of human rights without regard for theparticular politics of the region in which any individual projectis carried out, but MSF will deny its assistance to groupswhose motives or actions contradict basic human rights.While MSF disavows political allegiances, it rises admirablyto the task of allowing its choices in how to help (and inwhom to help) to speak to some universal foundation for basichuman rights.MSF volunteers recognize that an act ofomission is still an act, that not to make a choice is to make avery clear choice indeed. They are aware that, in the words ofBrazilian educator Paulo Freire, \"washing one's hands of theconflict between the powerful and the powerless means to sidewith the powerful, not to be neutral.\"To this end, MSF acknowledges the statement inherent inwhom they choose to help. During some political conflicts,their projects provide assistance to those working on only oneside of a political conflictagainst those who would aim toencroach upon that group's basic rights. During otherincidents, however, they attempt to help heal any whose livesare affected by the physical fighting of a heated but hazydisagreement, without making judgements that would renderonly one side worthy of receiving humanitarian assistance.One example of MSF's unapologetic attempts to help peoplesuffering on both sides of a disagreement has been itsinvolvement with recent political unrest over the disintegrationof the former Yugoslavia.In situations such as this one, afaint grey line may be all the distinction that stands betweenright and wrong, between the oppressors and the oppressedand this fine may be constantly shifting. In these types ofconflicts, two or more factions are fighting over opposingprinciples or desires, neither of which is an affront to basicuniversal human rightsorto MSF's sensibilitiesas ahumanitarian organization.Essentially, in this case, MSF isresponding to its belief that basic human rights are beingviolated on both sides when neither has access to needs suchas proper medical care due to opposition with the other, and isaiming solely to remedy this unilateral injustice.In still other conflicts, however, MSF clearly chooses sides.In the aftermath of the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan,MSF teams worked clandestinely with Afghan resistancefighters to care for their civilian population, demonstrating itsdecision to disregard national sovereignty. MSF was inAfghanistan just a few months after the initial invasion; MSFmembers are still there today. This mission has truly definedMSF's stance as an organization that defends the right of allvictims of human rights abuses to receive treatment. Theassistance offered by the MSF teams particularly at theoutset of the conflict has given the Afghan fighters moral aswell as medical support. MSF was Afghanistan's link to theWest, and helped force the struggles of the Afghans into theworld's view.Upon the Red Army's bombing of MSFhospitals in 1981, MSF publicly denounced the Soviet actionsand appealed to journalists tovisitAfghanistan.Thevolunteers of this mission have willingly placed themselves ingrave physical danger every day by working along the war-tornborders and within the ravaged country. This mission inAfghanistan has been, without a doubt, MSF's most dangerousto date.All potential MSF volunteers are warned that they must takeresponsibility for their own safety during MSF projects evenwhen they might not have control over it. MSF's initialidentity, developed as a result of its quick and courageousresponse to a 1976 conflict in Lebanon, was specifically thatof \"an organization that deals with dangerous emergencies.\"Potential applicants are warned that they may find themselvesworking in difficult, threatening, and unpredictable contextswith few, if any, of the comforts or securities of the livingconditions to which they are accustomed.Political instability is a given in most of MSF's missionlocations, as are differences in social and cultural practices andlimited resources.Volunteers need to be flexible andadaptable, and must possess \"more than just technicalcompetence,\" according to one message to potential volunteerson the DWB website. They must be aware that they are likelyto be witness to human rights violations, and that determiningtheir own appropriate response to these violations will be theirresponsibility.There is much danger in formulating andexecutingsuch a personal response to abuses of humanrights. But the chance to do just that is the reason many of thevolunteers have been drawn to MSF.IN CONCLUSION:MSF AS COACIENCE AND RESPONSEOrganizations such as MSF have helped to shape theconscience of today's applied science by advocating the beliefthat medicine must offer a response to the political climate ofthe world in which it is practiced. Even though so many ofthe problems that MSF reaches out to help solve areprecipitated by political discord and its choices in where toconcentrate itsefforts are clearly influenced by politicalfactors- MSF projects'activities are carried out all butindependent of politics. MSF is able to remain \"apolitical\"while advancing a code of morality and humanitarianismprecisely because universal human rights cannot be confined tonational boundaries; like MSF itself, they do not subscribe topolitical agendas.In working apart from yet within local political systems,MSF's members can undertake projects that support theadvancement of basic rights for all populations without makingovert political statements. Their choices and their commitmentspeak to what they believe, while their words find no need tojustify motives.In today's one-world society, science nolonger remains silent; but, as always, the actions of concernedscientists rise clear above the voice of politics and dogma.Who can get involved in MSF, and how?Primary care physicians willing to provide curative care andeducation are always needed to enter communities in crisiswith MSF teams. A working knowledge of infectious disease,tropical medicine, public health, and are not salaried,they are given a monthly stipend, health insurance coverage,round-trip transportation to the project country, and room andboard for the duration of the mission.

I alsowant to update you on the results of the WMS Board meetingsand the open forum as they pertain to pre-hospital wildernessmedical education issues. PETSAC met on Monday, August4, and discussed the current status of the curriculum work, aswell as the mission, goals and future plans of the committee.Intheirmeeting,PETSAC developedandmadearecommendation to the WMS Board about future work. Thatrecommendation can be found in the minutes of the PETS ACmeeting. (page 7)The WMS Board discussed the recommendation at length, andadopted the following plan based on those recommendations. 1.The PETSAC (committee) should be re-configured forfuture work as defined by the Board.2.WMS, with input from wilderness medical educators, willcompletethecurriculumproject by developing a\"recommended course content\" for Wilderness FirstResponder.3.A one day conference will be held in conjunction withthe 1998 WMS Annual Meeting which will explorecritical issues of wilderness medical education.The proposal was then presented for feedback at the PETS ACOpen Forum held on Tuesday. After listening to feedback atthe open forum, the WMS Board reconfirmed its commitmentto these three steps, at its Wednesday Board meeting.Since that time Dr. Often, WMS President, has moved toimplement the first two steps by: 1.Acknowledging and thanking PETSAC for the initialwork they have done and dissolving the committee.2.Appointing Linda Lindsey, RN, as the chair of theCurriculum Writing Task Force. She iscurrentlydiscussing and developing a strategy for configuring thecommittee. The specific task of this committee will betodevelopa \"recommended course content\"forWilderness First Responder.As a task force thiscommittee will be dissolved when the task is complete.Dr. Anne Dickison, as Annual Meeting Program Chair, isresponsible for the colloquium that will explore critical issuesof wilderness medical education.

Rosenbaum, Mercury Marketing SAFETY BROCHUREOFFERED BY NEW HAMPSHIREOUTDOOR COUNCILBy Peter CraneA free hiking safety brochure is now available from the NewHampshire Outdoor Council. The brochure is published as apublic service to make hikers in New Hampshire more awareof some of the hazards of hiking in the woods and mountainsof the Granite State, and of how proper preparation can lessenthose hazards.According to Wil Brown, President of the Council, \"We alsohave printed a free hiking safety card, which lists a few basictips and includes alistof recommended clothing andequipment for hikers.The information in the brochure andsafety card are intended principally for hikers, but it is alsousefulfor hikers,anglers, and others who enjoy NewHampshire's outdoors.\"The Council, notes Brown, is a private, non-profit organization,which includes in its mission the support of training andemergency equipment costs for backcountry search and rescuegroups throughout the state. \"Many of these groups consistwholly of volunteers,\" says Brown, \"so we want to do what wecan to encourage their participation in emergency missions.The volunteers are a very important complement to the effortsof New Hampshire Fish and Game, US Forest Service, and;Ithei-iiieT-federal, and local agencies.\"According to Brown, \"The best rescue is one that can beprevented,\" so the Council includes hiker safety education inits work, too. \"That's why we have produced the free brochureand safety card. Even with a mechanism for search and rescuein the state, sometimes even the best emergency effort can dono more than pick up the pieces. It's critical that peopleassume responsibility for their own safety, and plan for theirtrips knowledgeably and intelligently.\"For a free hiker safety brochure, and a free hiking safety card,send a stamped, self-addressed envelope to:NHOCDepartment WPO Box 157Kearsarge, NH 03847-0157.Organizations such as schools, outing clubs, church groups,and scout troops which may include group hikes in theiractivities are encouraged to request multiple copies of thebrochures and cards. ,10111t'1411Wilderness Medicine Newsletter NOVEMBER/DECEMBER 199748 WILDERNESS MEDICINE NEWSLETTER WILDERNESS MEDICINEEDUCATORS WANTEDThe Wilderness Medicine Institute is looking forqualified and dynamic Wilderness Medicine Educatorsinterested in becoming part of a team dedicated toproviding hands-on quality education for the recognition,treatment and prevention of wilderness emergencies.RESPONSIBILITIES: Our primary need isforinstructors to teach 10-day Wilderness First Respondercourses, although Wilderness First Aid and WildernessEMT courses are also available.
