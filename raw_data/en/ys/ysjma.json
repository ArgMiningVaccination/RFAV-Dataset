This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com ABSTRACT Introduction : Since the rst case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection was reported in 2012, the virus has infected more than 1300 individuals in 26 countries, and caused more than 480 deaths. Human-to-human transmission requires close contact, and has typically occurred in the healthcare setting. Improved global awareness, together with improved hygiene practices in healthcare facilities, has been highlighted as key strategies in controlling the spread of MERS-CoV. This study tested the in vitro efcacy of three of povidoneiodine (PVP-I: virus (Modied vaccinia virus Ankara, MVA) and MERS-CoV. Methods : According to EN14476, a standard suspension test was used to assess virucidal activity against MVA and large volume plating was used for MERS-CoV. All products were tested under clean (0.3 g/L bovine serum albumin, BSA) and dirty conditions (3.0 g/L BSA?3.0 mL/L erythrocytes), with application times of 15, 30, and 60 s for MVA, and 15 s for MERS-CoV. The products were tested undiluted, 1:10 and 1:100 diluted against MVA, and undiluted against MERS-CoV. Results : A reduction in virus titer of C4 log 10 (corresponding to an inactivation of C99.99%) was regarded as evidence of virucidal activity. This was achieved versus MVA and MERS-CoV, under both clean and dirty conditions, within 15 s of application of each undiluted PVP-I product. Conclusion : These data indicate that PVP-I-based hand wash products for potentially contaminated skin, and PVP-I gargle/mouthwash for reduction of viral loadElectronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi: 10.1007/s40121-015-0091-9 ) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

Keywords: Enveloped the coronaviruses (CoVs) that have made the transition from mammalian/avian hosts to humans are endemic in the human population, and typically associated with mild, self-limiting respiratory illness [ 1]. However, the remaining two human CoVs cause severerespiratory syndromes and are associated with considerable mortality [ 1]. In 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV caused a disease outbreak that claimed nearly 800 lives [2], and for the second consecutive decade this century, a new human CoV has emerged. The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV was rst isolated from a 60-year-old man in Saudi Arabia in June 2012 [ 3]. Three years later, it has been responsible for the infection of morethan 1300 individuals in 26 countries, and more than 480 related deaths [ 4]. Of all the cases of MERS-CoV reported to date, three quarters have occurred within the source country of Saudi Arabia (Table 1)[4]. Aside from a moderate outbreak in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), travel-associated spread toother countries in the Middle East, as well as examples in Europe, North America, Africa and Asia, has typically resulted in very minimal local outbreaks. The clear exception to this is situation in the Republic of Korea, where over180 cases have been reported, all during 2015 [4]. Infection in the index case followed recent travel to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE and Bahrain [5]. An International Health Regulations Emergency Committee has highlighted ve main factors contributing to the spread of MERS-CoV in the Republic of Korea [ 6]. Briefly, these were (1) a lack of awareness among healthcare workers and the general public; (2) suboptimal infection prevention and control measures in hospitals; (3) crowded emergency rooms and multi-bed hospitalrooms; (4) the practice of patients seeking care at multiple hospitals; (5) multiple visitors staying with infected patients in hospital rooms. Overall, clinical experience with MERS-CoV indicates that its spread within the human population requires close contact; the majority of cases have resulted from human-to-human transmission in healthcare settings [ 7]. There is good potential for outbreaks to be contained, given suitable levels of awareness and hygiene. The latest outbreak in Korea, however, istestament to the cost of neglecting these basic requirements. A recent study by our group demonstrated impressive, rapid virucidal activity of povidone iodine (PVP-I) against the Ebola virus (EBOV) [ 8]. PVP-I was also effective against the European reference virus (Modied vaccinia virus Ankara; MVA), which was determined to be a suitable surrogate test agent, facilitating the safe testing of the virucidal activity of antiseptic products againsthazardous pathogens, including enveloped viruses as EBOV [ 8]. PVP-I is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial, used globally in the medical eld\u2014including the Middle East\u2014 as a disinfectant for skin, hands and mucosalsurfaces as well as for wound treatment and eye applications [ 9].492 Infect Dis Ther (2015) 4:491-501Table 1 Number of laboratory-conrmed cases of MERS-CoV reported to WHO, by country and year Country 2012 2013 2014 2015 Total Middle East Saudi Arabia 5 136 679 217 1037United Arab Emirates 0 12 57 7 76 Qatar 0 7 2 4 13 Jordan 2 0 10 0 12Oman 0 1 1 4 6 Iran 0 0 5 1 6 Kuwait 0 2 1 0 3Yemen 0 0 1 0 1 Total 7 158 756 233 1154 Southeast Asia Republic of Korea 0 0 0 185 185 Philippines 0 0 0 2 2 China 0 0 0 1 1Thailand 0 0 0 1 1Malaysia 0 0 1 0 1 Total 0 0 1 189 190 Europe United Kingdom 1 3 0 0 4 Germany 1 1 0 1 3 The Netherlands 0 0 2 0 2France 0 2 0 0 2 Austria 0 0 1 0 1 Greece 0 0 1 0 1Italy 0 1 0 0 1 Total 2 7 4 1 14 Mediterranean and Arab countries Tunisia 0 3 0 0 3 Algeria 0 0 2 0 2 Egypt 0 0 1 0 1Lebanon 0 0 1 0 1Turkey 0 0 1 0 1 Total 0 3 5 0 8Infect Dis Ther (2015) 4:491-501 493It may be hypothesized that PVP-I would also demonstrate effective disinfectant properties against MERS-CoV. The study reported here evaluated skin cleanser, surgical scrub andgargle/mouthwash formulations of PVP-I for virucidal activity against both the reference virus MVA and MERS-CoV itself. METHODS Virucidal Products Tested Three PVP-I antiseptic products study: the brand name Betadine, manufactured by Mundipharma (Limburg,Germany). This article does not contain any new studies with human or animal subjects performed by any of the authors. Propagation of the Test VirusMVA Methodology for propagation of MVA was as described in [ 8]. Briefly, baby hamster kidney cells (BHK)-21 cells (cell bank of Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute, Germany) were infected with MVA (Institute of Animal Hygiene and Veterinary Public Health, University of Leipzig, Germany) and culturedat 37 /C176C in a humid atmosphere under 5.0% CO 2. The virus was cultivated from confluent monolayers with a maximum age of 2 days. MERS-CoV Cultivation of MERS-CoV was based on thesame overall method as for MVA. The MERS-CoV, HCoV-EMC/2012 (Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands) was used as the test virus. Vero E6 cells (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC)were used for virus cultivation and the suspension test. Inactivation AssayTests were carried out once in accordance with EN14476:2013/FprA1:2015 at 20 \u00b11/C176C[10]. The test assay comprised 100 lL virus suspension, 100 lL interfering substance (clean, 0.3 g/L bovine serum 1:100 dilution). A virus control mixture was also assessed using double-distilled water in place of the test product. After the specied contact time (15, 30 or 60 s), virucidal activity was immediately suppressed by dilution with ninevolumes of ice-cold medium (minimal essential medium ?2.0% fetal calf serum) and serially diluted tenfold. Infectivity was determined byTable 1 continued Country 2012 2013 2014 2015 Total North America United States of America 0 0 2 0 2Total 0 0 2 0 2 Total 9 168 768 423 1368 Data as of 7 July 2015 [ 4] MERS -CoV Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, WHO World Health Organization494 Infect Dis Ther (2015) 4:491-501means of end point dilution titration in microtiter plates. Aliquots of 100 lL from each dilution were added to six 200 lL samples of BHK-21 cells. Cultures were examined microscopically for cytopathic effects (CPE) after 8 days of inoculation. The virus titers were determined using the Spearman-Ka \u00a8rber method [ 11,12] and expressed as tissue culture infectious dose 50% (TCID 50/mL). The virucidal activity was determined by the difference of the logarithmic titer of the virus control minusthe logarithmic test virus ( Dlog 10 TCID 50/mL). This difference is presented as a reduction factor (RF) including its 95% condence interval (CI). A reduction in virus titer of C4 log 10(corresponding to an inactivation of C99.99%) was regarded as evidence of sufcient virucidal activity. The calculation was performed according to EN14476 [ 10]. Inactivation Assay Using Large Volume Plating (LVP) Method for Vericationof Concentration-Contact Time Values with Mers-CoVv In accordance with EN14476:2013/FprA1:2015, the inactivation tests were conducted once, at 20\u00b11/C176C[10]. One part MERS-CoV suspension (100lL) was mixed with 100 lL of either 0.3 g/L BSA (clean conditions) or 3.0 g/L BSA ?3.0 mL/ L erythrocytes (dirty conditions) as the interfering substance. The virus-protein mixture was added to 8 parts (800 lL) of the undiluted test product. After a contact time of15 s, 20 lL of the test mixture was added to 99.98 mL ice-cold medium. Aliquots (300 lL) of the diluted sample were then added to 336 wells containing the indicator cells. The cells were cultivated for 5 days, and then inspectedmicroscopically after 3 and 5 days forvirus-induced CPE in cell morphology. Calculations of viral titer (in cases of no virusor low viral count) were as detailed in [ 8]. RESULTS Determination of the PVP-I Kinetics in Clean and Dirty Conditions Using MVA The test concentrations and contact periods were chosen to observe the point at which each test preparation produced efcient virus inactivation. To demonstrate virucidal efcacy, disinfectant and antiseptic products are required to produce a log 10reduction in virus titer of at least 4 [ 10]. The log 10reduction factors produced by the test products under clean and dirty conditions at each time point are shown in Table 2. With each PVP-I formulation, log 10reduction in viral titer C4 was demonstrated under clean and dirty conditions after only 15 s with the undiluted and 1:10 dilutions (except for gargle/mouthwash, which, in dirty conditions, required 30 s of exposure at the 1:10 dilution). Under both clean and dirty conditions, the virucidal activity of the PVP-I products variedwith the concentration of available iodine The titers of MERS-CoV present in the control samples ranged from 6.00 to 6.50 log 10TCID 50/ mL under clean and dirty conditions. MERS-CoV viral titers were reduced between4.30 and 4.97 log 10TCID 50/mL after 15 s (Table 2), which corresponds to a reduction inInfect Dis Ther (2015) 4:491-501 495Table 2 Virucidal activity surgical and gargle/mouthwash against MVA and MERS-CoV Test MERS-CoV MVA15 s 15 s 30 s 60 s 15 s 15 s 30 s 60 s PVP-I surgical log 10reduction in viral titer) CIcondence interval, LVP large volume plating, -CoV Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, MVA modied vaccinia virus Ankara, n.d. not determined, PVP-Ipovidone iodine, sseconds exposure time aNo condence interval available for MERS-CoV (reduction factor calculated with Poissons formula of LVP) or for values expressed Ther (2015) 4:491-501MERS-CoV viral titer of C99.99% for all products tested. DISCUSSION As is the case for Ebola, MERS-CoV is an enveloped virus with a high biosafety level, for which there is no vaccination, nor any specic antiviral treatment [ 13,14]. While infection can remain subclinical\u2014indicating that not all casesmay be reported\u2014MERS-CoV more typically causes severe respiratory disease. During the rst year following the rst reported case, two-thirds of patients suffered severe disease [15], and over a third of reported cases to date have been fatal [ 4]. Containment of spread has proven achievable in most cases; thus far, no sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred anywhere in the world [ 4]. However, a lack of awareness among health care workers and the general public, coupled with inadequate prevention and control procedures, can result in outbreaks based on nosocomial infection, as recently observed in the Republicof Korea. Based on the current situation, the World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a number of recommendations [ 4]. Many of these reflect the lack of understanding of how humans become infected from animal orenvironmental sources, with particular emphasis on precautions relating to exposure to camels. The other focus is on ensuring that health care facilities adopt appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virusfrom an infected patient to other patients, health care workers and visitors. A practical measure applicable to both of these issues is the implementation of effective hand hygiene practice. Standard hand hygiene includes either washing hands with soap andwater or the use of an alcohol-based hand rub [16]. Randomized, controlled trial data are available to support the effectiveness of PVP-I and alcohol hand rubs over plain soap hand wash for hand decontamination, based on post-hygiene colony-forming unit count [ 17]. In the context of modied nger pad test [ 18]. In an evaluation of the effectiveness of nine different hand sanitizers against feline calicivirus (a surrogatefor norovirus), antiseptics containing 10% PVP-I achieved a greater viral reduction rate than any of the alcohol-based sanitizers, non-alcoholic sanitizers or antimicrobial soaps [ 19]. PVP-I has demonstrated virucidal activity against a rangeof enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. Perhaps most relevant in the context of the MERS-CoV is the evidence for effective inactivation of the SARS-CoV to below detectable levels within 2 min of exposure [ 20]. Effective hand hygiene is crucial in minimizing viral transmission from thecontaminated hands of an infected individual, either through direct person-to-person contact, or indirectly via contamination of surfaces. However, respiratory viruses are also subject to airborne (particles B5lm in size) or droplet ([5lm) transmission, in which infected material is released by the infected individual breathing, coughing or sneezing [ 21]. Gargling represents an effective personal hygiene measure against airborne/droplet transmission,as it can reduce the microbe count at the pharynx [ 22]. Together with hand washing and mask use, it has been proposed that gargling is one of the three major personal hygiene protection measures against commonairborne and droplet-transmitted infections [ 22]. Specialists advise that the criteria forInfect Dis Ther (2015) 4:491-501 497selecting mouthwashes should the antiseptic agent in killingpathogens [ 22]. Given the strong in vitro virucidal activity of PVP-I demonstrated in this and other studies, gargling/flushing with PVP-I may be an effective measure to disrupt the transmission of respiratory viruses, especiallyvia airborne/droplet transmission or after uptake via the mouth (such as when touching the mouth or food with contaminated hands). The data reported here indicate rapid virucidal activity of three formulations ofPVP-I against both MVA and MERS-CoV. The 15-s exposure time was assessed to study the virucidal kinetics of PVP-I against MVA over time (the minimum contact time for hygienic hand rub and hand wash dened inEN14476:2013 is 30 s [ 10]), and yet proved sufcient for all three formulations to be effective, against both MVA and MERS-CoV. MERS-CoV is a harmful enveloped virus and requires high biosafety levels for any investigation. It is not recommended that disinfectants are tested using highlycontagious and harmful viruses; thus, model viruses are used. The CEN/TC 216/WG1 committee, which establishes standardized European testing methods and requirements for the antimicrobial efcacy of chemicaldisinfectants and antiseptics, recently implemented the enveloped MVA as the model virus for the claim 'virucidal active against enveloped viruses for hygienic hand rub and hand wash'. MVA was chosen on thebasis of its low biosafety level, its known environmental stability and its practicability for laboratory use [ 23-25]. On the basis of these practical safety concerns, our study was conducted primarily using MVA withconrmation only in MERS-CoV. Usually, only low titers of MERS-CoV can be harvested in cell culture, resulting in a range of5.00-6.50 log 10TCID 50/mL. To demonstrate at least a 4 log 10reduction in virus titer, it is necessary for test mixtures containing low virus titers to undergo detoxication by molecular sieving, or to use a more sensitive assay such as LVP [ 26]. In LVP, a high volume of the lowest apparently non-cytotoxic dilution of theinactivation assay test mixture is added to the detector cell line and the cultures are monitored for virus-specic effects. Using this method, larger reductions in virus titer can be shown even at lower viral loads and contact times asshort as 15 s can be tested, minimizing the impact of any after effects. LVP offers sufcient sensitivity for reductions in virus titer to be detected even using test products that are highly cytotoxic in cell culture [ 27]. It should be considered that while the results of this in vitro analysis are a suitable basis for predictions about the virucidal efcacy of PVP-I, they do not provide direct information about the effectiveness of the products in practice. However, taken together with: (1) the emphasis placed by WHO on ensuring suitable levels ofhand hygiene; (2) recommendations for gargling with antiseptic mouthwash for the control of common airborne and droplet-transmitted infections [ 22]; (3) the fact that PVP-I is a product already in use andavailable within the most affected regions of the world, these data provide strong rationale for the use of PVP-I products for the prevention of infection by MERS-CoV. Improved awareness is needed in the health care setting to ensureeffective containment of the spread of this often fatal virus. CONCLUSION The outbreak of MERS-CoV in the Republic ofKorea is testament to the ongoing risk of healthcare-associated transmission, and498 Infect Dis Ther (2015) 4:491-501reinforces the need for timely diagnosis and implementation of prevention and controlmeasures. The three PVP-I products tested in this study demonstrated virucidal activity against MVA and MERS-CoV at room temperature, within only 15 s of exposure. This was observed under both clean and dirtyconditions. These data are consistent with those from other studies demonstrating the excellent virucidal activity of PVP-I against enveloped viruses. The data reported here indicate that PVP-I-based hand wash products for potentially contaminated skin, together with PVP-I gargle/mouthwash for reduction of viral load in the oral cavity and the oropharynx, may help to support hygiene measures duringoutbreaks of respiratory viruses.
