IV nurses work in roles where taking care of immediate needs is essential, but, she says, they must constantly look at the bigger picture. \"We have to look down the road so our patients get what they need from the outset,\" she says. \"We need to look long and hard at the best device to treat patients, especially those who are impacted by COVID-19.\" A device or approach that might have worked when a patient was admitted to a facility may no longer be effective as the patient's condition changes. Miller is unequivocally proud of her specialty and of being part of the INS. \"We are more than the equipment we use,\" she says. And with vascular access as a global issue, Miller says INS decided to take a fresh look at what a global approach means to their nurses and patients. \"We've always been proactive in how we deliver the care we give,\" she says. \"We make sure the people who are at the table represent those in their areas.\" Doing so makes sure INS is present and aware of diversity, equity, and inclusion issues and how they impact healthcare delivery and outcomes. \"We want to make sure people have a voice,\" says Miller. \"And we want to make sure as an organization that every patient we see has a voice and is represented.\" DEI work is not a one-and-done deal, says Miller. \"Whatever we develop and put forth, we need to make sure it's ongoing work.\" That means looking at how diversity is represented including different genders and identities, sexual preference and orientation, practice settings, and culture and race. \"To the best of the abilities of our organization, we want to make sure we don't put forth something that doesn't consider how people feel,\" she says. \"We challenge others to listen with empathy and care.\" One of the best ways to learn about and to improve on DEI work is to talk with people, says Miller. Learning about what is important to people, how they do things, and how they see the world imparts the kind of detailed knowledge that can make all the difference to a patient. Once you are informed, you can always do things a little better and that gets noticed. \"When you prove your credibility, there are no limits,\" she says. \"When you recognize things are outdated, you change them up.\" With a focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion, a new interaction with patients opens up, especially with those from underrepresented populations. \"Patients are grateful for the advocacy,\" says Miller, \"because there is someone in their corner, who is advocating for them and listening to them.\" The pandemic has shifted DEI efforts in ways that no one could have predicted. Of all the different healthcare practices or interactions patients may or may not be comfortable with, the need to separate people and keep them isolated has created an enormous burden for families and healthcare staff. \"There are no family members present who can speak to a patient's preferences,\" says Miller. Vascular access nurses have shifted into finding innovative techniques to overcome this barrier. On this year's IV Nurses Day, Miller says although the typical celebrations aren't possible, it's still important to honor the work infusion and vascular access nurses do. \"For me personally, I think there's so much uncertainty in work and in healthcare now\u2014it's good to know we get to recognize our specialty,\" says Miller. \"We are the best resources where vascular access is concerned and we take that very seriously.\" Conferences have moved to a virtual format and will likely remain that way for a while. Traveling to and spending days at conferences in rooms and events full of people might be one of the last \"return-to-normal\" business practices we see. But professional nurses still need the education, networking, and exposure to new ideas that make conferences so valuable. You can still gain a lot from a virtual conference, but it takes some preparation and a new set of expectations. Understand the Platform Virtual conferences will use some of the most state-of-the-art platforms to help attendees form and keep the personal connections that make conference learning and networking so easy. Download any needed software ahead of time and then spend some time exploring the conference's site so you're able to confidently move from an event to a working group to a panel discussion. Pay Attention to Your Own Surroundings You might be home, but a conference is no time to look like it. Wear business-appropriate clothes that you would wear to a typical conference. It's better to be a little over dressed than to look too casual. If you find other attendees are dressing down, you can always change if that would make you more comfortable (and that's one of the positive aspects of attending a conference from home). Be aware of your surroundings, too. It's not always easy to find a well-lit, quiet, neutral background space when you're in your house (one of the negative aspects of attending a conference from home). Look for a plain wall or one with just a few items on it or find a neutral virtual background. Use headphone to reduce noise distractions. Don't eat while you're on video. Be Prepared Before you sit down, make sure you have all the supplies you would need at a traditional conference. Just like taking an online class, have your laptop or pens and paper ready for note taking and try to limit distractions as much as possible. And because business card swapping is less likely to happen, practice a good elevator pitch\u2014you'll need it. Have a brief summary of who you are, your professional role, one or two personal points to discuss, your organization and how it relates to the industry and this conference, and what you're hoping to get from the conference. You'll use these pieces of your elevator pitch throughout the conference as you talk with others in breakout sessions or in networking sessions. Practice ahead of time as you would for an in-person event so your delivery is polished and succinct\u2014you need to leave time for others to talk. Then prepare a few questions so you can ask people about themselves. Others might not be as prepared, so asking about them makes the virtual interaction less awkward. Participate Ask questions, attend as many breakout sessions as you can, connect with others through the conference's social media channels, and offer your insight. You might not be attending in person, but that doesn't mean you can't be fully present. Really listen to the speakers and get as much out of the virtual conference as you can. It's likely that sessions will be recorded, so take advantage of that bonus to attend all the sessions relevant to your goals. Talk to other attendees through any additional platforms\u2014you'll find Slack is used by many\u2014so you can participate and also tune into the top-of-mind topics others are asking about or discussing. Follow Up After the conference, follow up with people you met and want to keep in touch with. Virtual conferences will become more common, but there will be a time when you might get to meet these new connections in person. You want to make a good impression and build on the strength of your initial meeting\u2014just like when you meet someone face-to-face. Other nursing professionals are navigating uncharted waters right now and are looking to share and gain information on how to proceed. They want to know how the pandemic has impacted nurses, patient care, the nursing industry and the larger healthcare industry, and how they can make improvements. And with virtual settings being the current norm, you'll be able to meet up again without having to wait until the next conference. A virtual conference isn't the same as in-person and can lack the buzz of excitement and potential so many attendees enjoy at a traditional conference. But there are big benefits to virtual events, and they offer opportunities that in-person events don't. Instead of thinking of a virtual conference as a second choice, think of a few opportunities you'll have thanks to this new format. That change of perspective gives you a head start on enjoying this new experience. Although more than 3 million people in the United States have glaucoma, awareness of this eye disease, how it starts, and how it progresses isn't widespread. The Glaucoma Research Foundation says January's Glaucoma Awareness Month, can help people become more knowledgeable about this disease. Glaucoma can eventually lead to blindness, but obvious symptoms of it are almost nonexistent. For that reason, glaucoma is known as a silent or sneaky disease. According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO), glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness in people over 60. The disease causes fluid to build up in the eye which can damage the optic nerve and cause irreversible damage. The disease has some hereditary traits, and it can affect one eye but not the other. The good news is if glaucoma is caught early, significant damage can be prevented, saving the patient's eyesight. Regular eye screenings are vital to finding the pressure buildup in the eye, so if any patients have a history of glaucoma in their family, they should be aware of how important these screenings are. According to The Glaucoma Foundation, age alone is also a risk factor, and glaucoma is more commonly found in people over age 40 rather than those in younger groups. There are other risk factors to be aware of. Preexisting conditions including high blood pressure, diabetes, an eye injury, long-term steroid use, and nearsightedness can predispose someone to glaucoma. In addition, those of African, Hispanic, Latino, and Asian descent have an increased risk of developing one or both of the two types of glaucoma\u2014angle-closure glaucoma or normal tension glaucoma. If you or any of your patients notice any vision changes, it's wise to consider the possibility of glaucoma. By the time symptoms develop, some damage has occurred, so it's essential to get any symptoms checked early. Things to look for include any blurred vision, cloudy or dark spots in the field of vision (including peripheral), eye pain, or even headaches. According to the American Glaucoma Society, treatments for this eye disease include anything from medications and eye drops to reduce the swelling in the eye caused by fluid buildup. Advanced cases may require surgery to help drain the excess fluid in a permanent manner. This can include a laser surgery to improve the drainage capability of the eye. With treatment, eye damage can be slowed, but some low vision can still happen, even if the final result isn't blindness. People need to learn how to live with the disease and manage the resulting symptoms as much as possible. Working as a team with a good ophthalmologist can help, but the patient's entire medical team can also act as a resource and support for managing glaucoma for the long-term. As a nurse, you can help patients become aware of this disease and the risks associated with it. And in your personal life, you can help your family and friends, as well as yourself, keep up with screenings to catch any early signs of the condition. Cervical health is an essential part of well-health screenings and can help detect cervical cancer, one of the more preventable types of cancer. January is Cervical Health Awareness Month and highlights the steps that can help prevent cervical cancer. According to the National Cervical Cancer Coalition, more than 13,000 people are diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer every year. And while any case of cancer is one too many, cervical cancer rates were once much higher and more deadly than they are now. Cervical cancer used to be the leading cause of cancer deaths among women in the United States, but several developments have led to dramatic positive change. Most cases of cervical cancer are caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), most men and women will be infected with one of the strains of HPV at some point. Currently, 80 million Americans are infected with HPV, with 14 million additional infections yearly. In most cases, the virus will stay present in the body and will go away, like many viruses do, within a couple of years. There are more troublesome strains that will remain in the body and can cause different types of cell changes that can lead to cancer. According to the CDC, there are a few ways the medical community can approach prevention detection, and treatment. The introduction of the HPV vaccine, regular Pap smears, and tests to detect the presence of HPV have dramatically reduced the incidence of cervical cancer in the United States. HPV Vaccine Development of the HPV vaccine was a game-changer for preventing this kind of disease. Nearly all cervical cancers are caused by HPV, a virus with many strains. Some strains of the virus can cause genital warts while other strains cause few or no symptoms but can lead to changes in the cervix over time that cause cancer if left undetected and untreated. Although adults can get the HPV series of vaccinations up until age 45 (it is most recommended up until age 26), it is highly recommended for youths beginning around age 11 or 12. Receiving the vaccine before any potential exposure to HPV can prevent infection with the virus, but isn't a treatment if the virus is already present. Screening Increasing attention to screening for cancerous changes in the cervical cells with Pap smears and for detection of any HPV levels in cells (two separate tests that can be done at the same visit) has upped the detection rate of more treatable precancerous changes. If cervical cell changes are detected, treatment options are available and will depend on the findings. Removal of the precancerous cells may be recommended to prevent cancerous changes. And a positive HPV test with a normal Pap smear offers valuable information that may lead to more frequent screening to catch changes early. Talking to Patients and Families Despite its effectiveness, rates of HPV vaccination lag behind what many medical professionals consider ideal. If patients and families in your practice seem hesitant, it might help to offer a few facts. The vaccine is to prevent cancer, but because HPV is transmitted sexually, some families relate the vaccine with condoning sex. The more you can separate the two so that the concern is for long-term health and is for potential exposure, the more success you might have. The American Academy of Pediatrics' HPV Champion Toolkit is another resource to help increase vaccination rates which will lead to fewer cases of cervical cancer. The most important prevention for preventing cervical cancer is to keep up with regular screenings. If you haven't had a Pap smear in a while or have been postponing your annual visit because of a packed schedule, put it back on your high-priority, staying healthy list. Outcomes are drastically different when these changes are caught at a treatable stage. The thyroid gland might be small, but any changes to its function can pack a huge wallop on how you feel every day. During January's national Thyroid Awareness Month, pay attention to any possible symptoms that could indicate problems in you or any of your patients. Symptoms of hypothyroidism are frequently dismissed by patients. As a nurse, your patients may complain about being excessively tired or lacking energy or even that they have a worsening mood. They may have noticed their hair is thinning or falling out or seems especially brittle. Hypothyroidism can cause people to gain weight and to feel cold in temperatures that were previously comfortable. Often, people will attribute these symptoms to stress, a particularly busy time, or seasonal changes. Hyperthyroidism It might seem that symptoms of hyperthyroidism would be the polar opposite of having hypothyroidism, but that's not always the case. Because hyperthyroidism can speed up the metabolism, patients might also pass off symptoms like a racing heart, more-than-normal sweating, or mood changes to job stress, lots of activity, or even an increased fitness routine. But they can also experience the fatigue and hair loss that hypothyroidism presents. Some patients may notice more prominent eyes (Graves' disease) or even feel their thyroid gland itself is enlarged. Thyroid Cancer According to the American Cancer Society, rates of this cancer have increased in the last decade in young adults (3 percent increase annually) and adolescents (4 percent increase annually), and even those who have had no prior thyroid problems can have thyroid cancer. This highly treatable cancer often presents as a lump in the neck rather than with symptoms like those of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, and even blood tests don't show anything abnormal. If any of your patients mention these symptoms, a blood test may be in order. According to the ATA, a simple lab test will check thyroid hormone levels. If the levels of thyroxine (T4) or triiodothyronine (T3) or of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) are too high or too low, follow up will help determine next steps of medication, treatment, and referral to a specialist. If you or they notice any kind of lump in the thyroid gland, follow up tests are necessary to check for cancer. Thyroid problems are fairly common and approximately 20 million Americans have some kind of thyroid disease. Listen to your patients as they describe any physical, cognitive, or emotional changes they have experienced to help detect any changes in the early stages. "}
