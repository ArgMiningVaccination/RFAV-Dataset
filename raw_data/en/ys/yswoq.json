Email: tholene.sodi@ul.ac.za Culture influences conceptualizations about illness, health and healthcare. In this article we argue that Western-oriented health care models have limited success when applied to health conditions of people of non-Westerncultures and contend that culture is an important factor in health, illness and healing. We present two cultural modes ofillness and healing to illustrate that many health conditions are meaningful and can be effectively managed withconsideration of the cultural contexts of the communities concerned. We illustrate, by case examples, how thesecultural conceptualisations influence the treatment of illness in three different cultural settings. In addition, we identifysome of the key challenges to integrating traditional healing into counselling and psychotherapy. Integration of differentcultural healthcare models is a best practice in comprehensive context sensitive delivery of healthcare. Keywords: Culture and healthcare, illness, traditional healer, traditional healing, Western-oriented healthcare systems, integrat- ing healthcare systems Culture is an important factor in healthcare (Jackson, 1987). According to MGOMA (2003), the most significant instrument inhealing or healthcare delivery is the client's culture. Vontress(2005) also asserts that, in therapy, the most effective thera-peutic agents are those who embody the culture of their clients.Maraich (2003) observes that every human society has its owncultural system(s) for responding to diseases and restoringhealth to individuals who are ill. The various cultural realitiespeople have constructed, whether these be in terms of beliefs,values, languages, institutions, customs, labels and laws, allhave significant influence in human functioning, and, therefore,in how health, is defined. Good and Good (1982) note that themeaning of illness (or health) for an individual is grounded in thenetwork of meanings of an illness (or health) of that individual'sculture. Included in this network of cultural meanings of an ill - ness are the metaphors associated with the illness, the care patterns that shape the experience of the illness and the socialreactions by the sufferer. Since illness or disease (physical, so - cial and mental including pains, distress, loss, sorrow and be - reavement) is a condition that is experienced by all humans, ir - respective of culture, So (2005) contends that each culture has its own conceptual or explanatory model for illness and health.Since all cultures have their own unique explanatory models ofillness (or health), the non-Western cultural models ofhealthcare are simply of different conceptual frameworks of ill - ness and or psychological discomfort when compared with Western models (Buhrmann, 1986; Moodley, 2000). There is nosingle universal worldview regarding causation of illness or ap - propriateness of treatment (Moodley & Sutherland, 2010). The different cultural conceptualizations of realities pertaining to ill - ness and health simply mean that there can be no universal ap - plicability of one cultural healthcare system. Therefore, in terms of therapeutic approaches to healthcare, such simplistic notionsas considering one approach universally primary or superior are no longer tolerable (Moodley & Sutherland, 2010; Tseng &McDermott, 1975). In this article, we argue that culture is an important factor in healthcare and that each culture has its own unique conceptual - ization(s) about illness, health and healthcare. To support thisposition we, in this section, first discuss the widespread prac - tices and or uses of indigenous traditional healthcare especially in non-Western societies of the world. We then discuss furtherhow cultural beliefs influence perceived causes of illness andthe theory or theories of cure. We do this by tracing the historyof Western medicine to indicate that Western-orientedhealthcare is a derivative of Western cultural values and beliefs.We also present two non-Western cultural conceptualizations ofillness (Indian and African) to further our argument that therecan be no one single cultural healthcare model that has univer - sal applicability Influences of Cultural Beliefs on Perceived Causes of Illnesses Cultural or indigenous knowledge systems regarding healthcare, or traditional healthcare approaches and methods,have been in existence since time immemorial. They have beenplaying significant roles in improving human conditions, or ele - vating the quality of life, promoting health, curing diseases, pre - venting illness, facilitating personal empowerment and social transformation (Vontress, 2000 ). Traditional healthcare is gen - erally commonly used in most parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America and for millions of people living in the rural areas ofthese parts of the world traditional herbal medicine, traditionaltreatments and traditional practitioners are the main, if not theonly sources of healthcare (Chan, 2008). The Pro-CultureJournal of Psychology in Africa 2011, 21(3), 349-356 Printed in USA - All Rights ReservedCopyright /c2112011 Journal ofPsychology in Africa ISSN 1433-0237Health Organization (2005) asserts that only 10 to 30% of worldwide healthcare is delivered by conventionalbiomedically-oriented practitioners and that in poor, rural andmarginalized populations the number of traditional practitioners,making use of their cultural or indigenous knowledge to deliverhealthcare, often exceeds Western-trained healthcare provid - ers. This means that traditional or indigenous healthcare sys - tems are very significant to the overall healthcare of the peoples of the world. By traditional approach to healthcare it is meant thesum total of all the indigenous knowledge and traditional culturalpractices (whether explicable or not) used in the diagnosis, pre - vention and elimination of physical, mental and social imbal - ance which rely exclusively on practical experiences and obser - vations handed down from generation to generation, mostly verbally, but also, to some limited extent, in writing(Conserveafrica, 2006). The systems of healthcare are de - scribed as traditional because they are deeply rooted in the socio-cultural contexts and values of the communities. Tradi - tional healthcare, therefore, represents structured systems of ordering, classifying and explaining illness as well as for deliv - ery of healthcare services (Ataudo, 1985). The history of Western medicine is traced back to the writ - ings of Hippocrates (c.460 - c.360 B.C.), a Greek physician, who argued that all forms of illness (including mental illness) re - sult from some malfunction within the body (Holmes, 1994). Hippocrates' attribution of various illness types to naturalcauses was a significant departure from the supernatural viewsof illness that were popular during his time. According toHolmes (1994), it is the work of Hippocrates that influencedKraepelin in the late nineteen century to develop the first trulycomprehensive classification of mental disorders which subse-quently paved the way for the World Health Organisation's In-ternational Classification of Diseases (now in its tenth version)and the American Psychiatric Association's (1994) Diagnosticand Statistical Manual which is now in its fifth version. What isvery important to note here is that the ascendancy of the medi - cal approach as pioneered by Hippocrates resulted in a situa - tion where biology became the bedrock of all forms of illness (Kleinman, 1995). In other words, all forms of illness were per - ceived as a result of an individual's inner processes whilst all so - cial and cultural layers of reality were only held as epi-phenome - nal. Historically, Western psychological practice relies heavily on natural science whilst ignoring the role that social conditions,power relations and societal institutional arrangements play inshaping peoples' conceptualization Kyle, 2002; Vijver, & Leung, 2000). A good example here isthat of depression which would be regarded as a consequenceof some malfunction within an individual's bodily or psychicalstructures, when considered from Western perspectives. Onthe other hand, the conceptualization of depression (includingthe associated help-seeking behaviours) in many sub-SaharanAfrica communities take into account the spiritual, social andcultural factors (Sodi, 2009; Swartz, 1997). According toMdleleni (1990), Mzimkulu (2000) and Ngubane (1980),\"amafufunyana\" which is described as an extreme form of de - pression with psychotic features (including hysteria and suicidal tendencies) is explained in terms of spirit possession. Mabetoa(1992), while also alluding to the etiology of psychoses as spiritpossession states further that spirits are not simply relics of pastbut archetypes of the collective unconscious of individuals. A number of studies have pointed out that medicine and mental health disciplines such as psychiatry and psychology(whose subject matters include nosological categories like de - pression, paranoia and anorexia) are knowledge systems that are premised on conceptual frameworks that are deeply em - bedded in a European socio-cultural matrix (Gergen, 1992; Landrine, 1995; Nobles, 1976; Wu, 1982). While it is often takenfor granted that counselling and psychotherapy are aspects ofWestern culture, assisting people to function effectively in theircommunities is not unique to Western cultures. All cultures ofthe world have different unique ways of explaining illness and ofbringing health to the people. Thus and according to Shwederand Bourne (1982), the Western-oriented conceptual frame - work reflects only a minority view among the cultures of the world. This point is eloquently expressed by White and Marsella(1982) who wrote that: \"[Even] ... the very notion of 'mental illness' as a domain of behavioural and medical experience is a product of specificcultural and historical traditions which regard certain formsof behavioural dysfunction as essentially psychological andmedical in nature ....( p .5 ) To further illustrate the socio-cultural embeddedness of the notions of illness and healing and to expose the danger of reli - ance on single cultural models of healthcare we present two cul - tural models of illness and healing which are meaningful if un - derstood from within the cultural context of the communities concerned. Indian Cultural Model of Mental Illness The first cultural model of (mental) illness and healing that we present is the theory of psychological medicine in the an-cient Indian medical tradition of Ayurveda. According toObeyesekere (1982), there are three fundamental assumptionsthat could be regarded as the foundation of Ayurvedic medicine.First, the universe is believed to be comprised of five \"bhutas\" or basic elements (atoms), which are ether ortejas\" ). These five universal elements are also believed to be present inall life, including the food that we eat. \"As these five elementscontained in the food are 'cooked' by the fires of the body, theyare converted into a fine portion ('ahara-prasada' ) and refuse ('kitta' or'mala' )\" (Obeyesekere, 1982, p. 237). Second, the body is comprised of the fine portion of food which has beentransformed and refined and has seven components ('dhatus' ), ('sukra' ). The latter component which is believed to be the most highly re - fined element in the body, serves to tone down the whole organ - ism. Third, there are three humours (i.e., the universal element of wind, fire appearing as bile, and water appearing as phlegm)that are supposed to be held in a harmonic balance. According to Ayurvedic medical theory, the harmonic bal - ance of the above three humours is essential for the mainte - nance of physical and mental health. Once this homeostatic condition is upset, these humours become ' dosas ' or 'troubles' that will lead to an illness of the organism. The ' dosa ' may also damage one or more of the seven components of the body. Ac - cording to Caraka (cited in Obeyesekere, 1982, p. 239), the causes of humoral upset are numerous and may include the fol - lowing: faintheartedness, mental shock, consumption of im - proper foods, wrongful bodily activity, other diseases, or those whose \" ... minds have been impaired by the attacks of lust, an - ger, greed, excitement, fear, infatuation, fatigue, grief, and also those that are injured by trauma\" (p. 239)350 Sodi & BojuwoyeAfrican Cultural Model of Mental Illness The second cultural model of illness and healing that we present looks at how some African communities conceptualiseand deal with some physical, mental and social dysfunctions.According to Swartz (1997), the indigenous African communi - ties in South Africa perceive harmony between the individual and the ancestors as critical in maintaining good mental health(see also Edwards, this Issue). This harmonious situation isconsidered to exist if the individual and his/her family have mettheir socio-spiritual obligations to the ancestors. Some mentalillness conditions are believed to occur when this harmoniousrelationship between the ancestors and the living is disturbed.In such illnesses that are a result of disharmony, treatment by atraditional healer is aimed at restoring the balance betweenone's family and the ancestors. The idea of harmony in health and illness is also important in other indigenous communities in other parts of Africa. For ex - ample, among the Bambara of Mali, the fundamental concepts regarding health and illness are based on the idea of balancesand imbalances between the components of the organism, andbetween those components and the elements of nature such asearth, water, fire, metal and heavenly bodies such as the sun,moon and stars (Koumare, 1983). Each element is seen as ca - pable of exerting a specific influence on certain organs. Thus from birth, the newborn infant is subject to the control of ele-ments of nature, and survival depends on the capacity to estab-lish equilibrium in an environment containing both favourableand unfavourable elements. Within the context of the Bambaracommunity, an illness is bound to result in cases where there isan imbalance either in the components of the organism or in sit-uations where these components of the organism are in dishar-mony with the elements of nature. Cultural Approaches to the Treatment of Illness Looking at the above notions of health and illness, it is evi- dent that efforts aimed at restoring health to individuals who areill are shaped by the cultural and social realities of a particularsociety or culture. Consequently, a psychiatrist in Western med - icine, the Indian shaman or the African traditional healer have two critical functions to perform when they encounter someonewho presents with a problem. First, they must attempt to identifyand diagnose the particular phenomenon experienced by thepatient. Second, they must link the patient's idiosyncratic expe - rience with a culturally meaningful theory, which will enable them to integrate the patient back into the cultural mainstream(Awanbor, 1982; Kleinman, 1995). In other words, the healer(whether Western or traditional) must redefine the vague com - plaints presented by the patient in terms of some causal agent like anger of the ancestors, or the violation of a taboo. By nar - rowing down the cluster of symptoms and complaints and giving a focus on something (a diagnosis), the healer is in a position todefine the problem and to provide a culturally meaningful reme - dial action. The following cases are illustrative: Case 1: George (England) - George is a 32 year old single male carpenter who has been staying alone in a flat in down - town London for the last 8 years. In the last six months or so, he started showing a number of symptoms which among others in - cluded the following: feelings of emptiness, diminished interest in most activities that he used to enjoy, difficulties falling asleep,inappropriate guilt, difficulties in concentrating and recurrentthoughts of death. He was advised by a neighbour to consult apsychiatrist. The psychiatrist who saw him did a full clinical as -sessment which involved a clinical interview, a medical examination, psychological testing and some laboratory tests.The results of the clinical assessment suggested that George issuffering from a major depressive episode. This was attributedto a number of psychosocial stressors that included a recentbreakup with a girlfriend. The psychiatrist suggested a numberof interventions which included admission to a hospital, medica - tion, psychotherapy and a sick leave that would take him away from his place of employment for two months. As illustrated in the above case, the patient consults a psy - chiatrist alone after he was advised by a neighbour to do so. Upon arrival, the psychiatrist uses some clinical procedures in - cluding a medical examination and laboratory tests. The reme - dial action that is suggested is informed by the diagnostic pic - ture that emerges during George's consultation with the psychiatrist. In this case, the psychiatrist uses culturally mean - ingful diagnostic and intervention theories to redefine the symp - toms and to provide some form of relief to the patient. Case 2: Mohammed (India) - Mohammed is a 32 year old single male factory worker in Calcutta. He stays with his elderlyparents, two brothers (both married with children), two sistersand several nephews and nieces. In the last six months or so,he started showing a number of symptoms which among othersincluded the following: feelings of emptiness, diminished inter - est in most activities that he used to enjoy, difficulties falling asleep, inappropriate guilt, difficulties in concentrating and re-current thoughts of death. His elderly parents and one of hisbrothers brought him to a shaman. Through his dealings withthe spiritual world, the shaman determined the cause of the pa-tient's problems and suggested that Mohammed has beencalled to enter the shamanic profession. The remedial course ofaction prescribed included the following: a). Mohammed was re-quired to go through a process of apprenticeship under the tute-lage of a master shaman; b). During this period, he was ex-pected to perform regular rituals of the family deities; c). He hadto regularly undergo periods of fasting; and, d). He was in - structed to live according to the prescribed conduct and rules that govern shamanic training. The case above illustrates the spiritual, social and cultural context of illness. Mohammed's illness mobilised the family toconsult shaman, who is believed to be in touch with the spiritualforces that govern the universe. The explanation given for his ill - ness, including the treatment thereof is meaningful in the con - text of this patient's culture. Case 3: Sello (South Africa) -Sello is a 32 year old single male machine operator who stays with his parents, three broth - ers and three sisters in Soweto township in Johannesburg. In the last six months or so, he started showing a number of symp - toms which among others included the following: feelings of emptiness, diminished interest in most activities that he used toenjoy, difficulties falling asleep, inappropriate guilt, difficulties inconcentrating and recurrent thoughts of death. His parents tookhim to a traditional healer in the deep rural area of LimpopoProvince which is about four hundred kilometres north of Johan - nesburg. The traditional healer that was visited threw the divina - tion bones on a mat and suggested that Sello suffers from a condition called 'senyama\" (loosely translated to mean \"badluck\"). The traditional healer suggested that the \"senyama\" wasvisited on Sello by angry family ancestors who feel that his par - ents have \"turned their backs on them\". As a remedial action, Sello's family was advised to organise a black goat that was tobe slaughtered and sacrificed to the ancestors.Culture, Health and Illness 351Through the use of divination bones, the traditional healer in the above case is able to interpret the patient's symptoms as anindication of ancestral displeasure. Based on this interpretation,some specific interventions (i.e rituals) that are culturally mean - ingful are suggested by the traditional healer. . The Challenges Within each culture of practice, some health care practices appear to have evidence of efficacy. For instance, African indig - enous health approaches have evidence of more relative suc - cess in treating mental health conditions than physical condi - tions (Mpofu, Peltzer, & Bojuwoye, 2011). In fact, there are many positive attributes of African and other non-Western tradi - tional healthcare methods and these are responsible for the high confidence in their practices and practitioners by people indeveloping countries. Among these attributes are its strong his - torical and cultural roots which make its practice context sensi - tive (Chan, 2008). Its accessibility and affordability are also im - portant attributes as well as its philosophy of seeing the person holistically rather than through a Cartesian divide (Chan, 2008;Moodley & Sutherland, 2010). However, despite these attrib - utes the suggestion that different cultural healthcare models be integrated for comprehensive healthcare coverage is likely to bemet with many challenges. Among the challenges we discussedin this paper are epistemological challenges, challenges relatedto attitudes, abuses, treatment methods and other practice is-sues as well as research challenges. Epistemological questions. Philosophies underpinning the healing approaches of Western medical and non-Western healthpractices are considerably different. These healing traditions ap-pear to be shaped, among others, by c onceptualisations of the self in different cultures (Geils, 2011; Shweder & Bourne, 1982). Forexample, in American and Eur opean societies there is a greater tendency to use individuated psychological types of explanatoryconstructs in describing social behaviour. As in the case of Georgein the above case study, the psychiatrist defines the problem interms of George as a bounded and complete universe that is un - able to cope with a number of psychological stressors. As Myers (1988) has pointed out, the tendenc y in Western epistemology is to break the world or human experienc e into different parts that are to be understood 'objectively' by means of the five senses. On theother hand, most non-Western socie ties tend to conceptualise re - ality holistically and dynamically in terms of its material and spiri - tual dimensions (Myers, 1988). For example, a traditional healer may interact with the ancestors by means of dreams to helphim/her to understand a patient. A s Grills (2002) has pointed out, such sources of knowledge relating to health and illness are notconsidered legitimate in popular Western knowledge systems(Grills, 2002). Therefore, any effort aimed at integrating traditional healthcare or psychotherapeutic prac tices with Western-oriented models is likely to be confronted wit h some difficulties given the di - vergent epistemological origins of Western and indigenous tradi - tional models. Challenges related to practice issues. Some criticisms about traditional healthcare practices are that they are harmful,unhygienic and unscientific. For example, in his submission tothe Gauteng legislature (South Africa) during public hearings ontraditional medicines, the late Dr Nthato Motlana (one of themost successful medical practitioners and influential black busi - nessmen in South Africa) expressed his strong views against traditional healers: \"There are many people who would want us to continue to believe in mumbo jumbo while the West moves into CATscans and advanced sonars for diagnosis. They want us to believe that the dried-up bones of a monkey's ankle can pro - vide us with a diagnosis (The Sunday Times, 08/06/1997). Similar sentiments and concerns have also been expressed by many critics of traditional healthcare practices or indigenouspsychotherapies describing them as exotic, primitive, demonic,sorcery, magic and witchcraft (Chevez, 2005; Marshall, 2005;Moodley, 2007; Praglin, 2005). Atherton (2007) also claims thatAfrican traditional healthcare has been described as being char - acterized by low hygiene standard, incorrect diagnosis, impre - cise dosage and wild claims. African traditional healers have also been criticized for their inability to keep patient history andrecords of assessment (Conserveafrica, 2006). Such chal - lenges described as being characteristic of traditional healing are also not uncommon with Western-oriented healthcare sys - tems. For instance, at any time, over 1.4 million people world - wide suffer from infectious complications acquired in hospital (Tikhomirov, 1987). Wenzel, Thompson, Landry, Russell,Miller, de Leon, and Miller, Jr., (1983) also state thatnosocomial, hospital-acquired infections, occur in 5% to 10% ofpatients admitted to hospitals in the United States of America.According to WHO (2002), nosocomial infections are promotedby many factors including invasive procedures, crowded hospi - tal populations and poor infection control practices. However, we are not justifying these malpractices and this explains thereason for our next discussion to further expatiate on malprac-tices in traditional healthcare system. Peltzer (1987) described some assessment procedures used by traditional healers which are potentially dangerous topatients. One example is village cleansing by identification ofwitchcraft among a whole community in an African country. Inthe process, all village inhabitants are summoned and asked tosurrender their witchcraft instruments on the understanding thatif they didn't, they and their families could be visited with greatmisfortunes. In a typical cleansing process villagers would bemade to pass by the healer and those who lose consciousnessand collapse while on the queue or as they pass the healer arepresumed to be witches weighed by their evil medicines. Insome instances, some villagers may lose consciousness fromexhaustion, anxiety or actual conviction of guilt due to somewrongs done or something which has been done, even if in un - related situation. What also makes this process dangerous is that sometimes the witch hunting ceremony may be an attemptto identify someone with whom the traditional healer (or an influ - ential member of the community on whose behalf the traditional healer is acting) has had previous disagreement or someonewho they want to get rid of from the village for some personalreasons (such as competition for some resources). While this isa fair criticism there is also evidence of malpractices in West - ern-oriented healthcare practices as is evident in the following extract from e! Science News, 2011: Poorly co-ordinated care increased the likelihood of medica - tion and medical errors by 110% to 200% across the coun - tries, with the highest levels in the Netherlands, followed by Germany and the UK. Cost-related barriers increased thelikelihood of medication and medical errors by 50% to160%, with the highest levels in the UK, followed by NewZealand and Australia. In another study by investigators from the Indiana University School of Medicine it has been revealed that most contributorsto medication errors and adverse drug events in busy primarycare practice offices are communication problems and lack of352 Sodi & Bojuwoyeknowledge in the safe and effective use of drugs (e! Science News, 2010). Very common criticisms associated with traditional healthcare practices are those around excesses and abuses ofpatients' human rights by practitioners. For instance, the use ofropes to tie the legs together and thereby physically restrain ag - gressive mental patients, the forcing of medications on patients and the forced sexual intercourse (or rape) as treatment proce - dures are some of the abuses levelled against African tradi - tional healthcare practitioners (Peltzer, 1987). Some Chinese traditional healing sessions have also been described as char - acterized by abuse as they are conducted in \"cramped facilities\" (So, 2005). Other criticism of traditional healthcare is that itspractitioners are poorly educated (Atherton, 2007). While these criticisms may be justified, it must also be stated that these also represent Western critics' attempts atconcentrating attention only on isolated cases of malpracticesof traditional medicine. On the contrary, the Western critics'practice is to de-amphasize many good practices of non-West - ern traditional medicine, for example, the standard practice by African traditional healers in the use of community and partici - patory approaches to the treatment of psychiatric patients. However, there are current efforts at training traditionalhealthcare workers in many African countries in order to reduce,if not eradicate completely these few cases of malpractice in tra-ditional medicine. For instance, the World Health Organization,WHO, has sponsored seminars and workshops to train tradi-tional birth attendance and midwives in many African countries(Conserveafrica, 2006). There is also a report of efforts by Uni-versity of Kwazulu Natal Medical School, in South Africa, of pro-viding series of training workshops for traditional healers in aneffort to improve their role in healthcare delivery (Packree,2007). Attitudinal Challenges. Related to the challenges of ex- cesses and abuses associated with practice of traditionalhealthcare is the negative attitude which it has engenderedamong Western -oriented practitioners. This negative attitudeparticularly manifests with regard to difficulty with getting West - ern-trained or oriented practitioners and traditional healthcare practitioners to work together. This challenge seems to be wellillustrated in a report by Peltzer and Mngqundaniso (2008) onthe South African experience which revealed that the effort tointegrate traditional and Western healthcare systems appearedto be met with suspicion and lack of communication among thetwo different types of healthcare practitioners (with differencesin trainings and or orientations). The report indicated it is as ifthere were two parallel healthcare systems being operated,making difficult cooperation and/or prevention of unnecessarycompetition, conflicts and misinformation among the two groupsof professionals. Moreover, getting western-oriented practitio - ners to work in rural communities of Africa presents its own challenges, not the least, that of poor or non-existinginfrastructural facilities (Atherton, 2007). Research challenges. Challenges associated with re - search into traditional or indigenous healthcare practices are of - ten more emphasized than most other challenges. Non-West - ern traditional healthcare, unlike Western healthcare, has little scientific or empirical evidence on safety. Chan (2008) also as - serts that non-Western traditional healthcare practices have no research data, no powerful methodologies for proving efficacy,ensuring quality, standardizing good manufacturing practices,testing for safety and conducting post-marketing surveillancefor adverse effects. Identifying appropriate research strategies for the provision of scientific evidence or data through test re - sults have also been considered as challenges to traditional or indigenous healthcare (Mpofu et al, 2011; World Health Organi - zation, WHO, 2002, 2008). Absence of infrastructural facilities, particularly literature or documented information has been described as a major factorcontributing to difficulties in researching traditional healthcare.These difficulties are probably due to traditional practices thatrely mostly on oral history and folklore, known only to initiate tra - ditional healers, and taught to others by healers themselves or spiritual agents. Chamberlain (2003) used the term \"performedknowledge\" to describe healing power or indigenous ways ofhealing also referred to as \"living texts\" in orality. The belief isthat these could lose power or become ineffective, if recorded(Solomon & Wane, 2005). Researching and documenting tradi - tional healing practices (including songs, dances, ceremonies, sacred medicines and traditional language serving as vehiclesand tools of traditional healers), would, therefore, meet with op - position from practitioners who might be reluctant to cooperate to disclose and share information relevant to their highly pro - tected healing power if it would be reduced to writing and kept in recorded forms. Challenges Related to Patenting and Uses of Traditional Herbal Medicines Traditional herbal treatments comprising herbs, herbal ma- terials, herbal preparations or finished herbal products are be-coming popular forms of traditional medicines often referred toas alternative or complimentary medicines (ACM) which havebecome lucrative on the international market (Bojuwoye & Sodi,2010). The World Health Organization (WHO, 2008) notes thata number of challenges with ACM revolve around patients'safety and effectiveness. Also noted are the challenges of dif-fering definitions and categorizations of traditional therapies be-cause it has been discovered that a single product can be de - fined as either food, a dietary supplement or herbal medicine depending on the country. Moreover, the growing market andgreat commercial benefits of alternative or complimentary medi - cines, all these have the potential of leading to over-harvesting of many indigenous plants which in turn pose very serious riskto biodiversity. The World Health Organization (2008) alsonotes the challenge of intellectual property right and the depriv - ing of indigenous people of the benefits accruing from sales of their indigenous plants as many of these plants end up beingpatented by Western pharmaceutical laboratories without refer - ences to where these herbal treatments have been obtained. Summary and Conclusion In this article we argued that illness, health and healthcare are culturally embedded. We stated that each culture of theworld has its own unique ways of explaining illness and of bring - ing health to the people and that, all healthcare systems or mod - els are cultural products . The Western-oriented healthcare sys - tem, in its own right, complete with its systems of beliefs, values and faith as well as methods and forms of knowledge, is a cul - tural system just like any non-Western traditional healthcare system, except that the two healthcare systems have differentconceptual frameworks of health, illness or psychological dis - comfort. We pointed out the danger of relying on single cultural healthcare model as no single healthcare system has universalapplicability. Since all cultural healthcare systems have benefi - cial contributions to make to the overall healthcare system ofCulture, Health and Illness 353the world, we supported the calls by other healthcare research - ers and practitioners that different cultural healthcare systems be integrated for effective context sensitive practices. We high - lighted challenges to such integration of different cultural healthcare systems especially those challenges emanatingfrom the criticisms of traditional healthcare systems by Westerncritics. We pointed out that the usual tendency of critics of tradi - tional healthcare is to focus on risk and pass judgement based on worst case scenarios and or outcomes while playing downthe efficacy of traditional medicine and the expertise of tradi - tional healthcare practitioners. Our view is that excesses, abuses and malpractices are not peculiar to non-Western tradi - tional healthcare practices as these are also happening in Western-oriented practices. However, researchers have re - vealed that non-Western traditional health practitioners are as effective in bringing health to the people as are Western-ori - ented healthcare practitioners (Epp, 1998). For example, ac - cording to Conserveafrica (2006), African traditional healers are found to be experienced and skilled in biomedical componentsof their professions, including an array of biomedical methodsand cultural practices ranging from fasting and dieting to herbaltherapies, and from bathing and massage to surgical proce - dures. Edwards (2004) also contends that non-Western tradi - tional healthcare providers are skilled and experienced in psychotherapeutic practices using procedures, methods andmaterials surprisingly resembling contemporary psychothera-pies including establishing trusting relationships with patients,diagnosis of problems, uses of imagery, dream interpretation,self-regulation and group support. It is on account of the efficacyof traditional healthcare and its significance in bringing health tothe majority of people of the world that the World Health Organi-zation recommended integration of traditional healthcare withWestern oriented mainstream systems as the surest means toachieve total healthcare coverage (Conserveafrica, 2006). Ourcontention is that it is in an integrated system that most of thechallenges attributable to traditional healthcare can be ad - dressed. Our argument is that to overcome the constraints related to integration, education, training and research is necessary. Edu - cation and training for traditional healthcare providers are im - portant for their acquisition of knowledge, attitudes, values and skills relevant to effective healthcare and particularly to the de - velopment of appropriate attitudes and values for breaking old habits and creating new characters in order to reduce patients'abuses and excesses often associated with their practices(Bojuwoye & Sodi, 2010). We further argued that the main goalof education and training for traditional healthcare practitionersshould be for capacity building in view of their expanded roles inhealth promotion and illness prevention and to enhance theirleadership roles and legitimate voices as trusted health authori - ties of their people (Bojuwoye & Sodi, 2010). In terms of educa - tion for Western-oriented practitioners, this would be for acqui - sition of appropriate knowledge and better understanding of traditional healthcare to enable them to change attitudes of dis - respect and suspicion to attitudes of appreciation and respect for the skills of traditional healthcare providers. This way, West - ern-oriented practitioners are more unlikely to see traditional healthcare providers as competitors, but more likely to trust andcollaborate in sharing information for effective healthcare deliv - ery. Western-oriented practitioners stand to benefit from train - ing to understand and utilize appropriate indigenous knowledgesystems including cultural practices and materials or tools for effective context sensitive practices. An integrated healthcare system will depend greatly on re - search to create new knowledge, understanding and better in - terpretations of cultural practices and tools that are relevant to health promotion and illness prevention. Both traditionalhealthcare and Western-oriented practitioners need training infinding modern truths in ancient wisdom, reassessment, re-in - terpretation, and reconstruction of concepts, principles and pro - cesses, the giving of new meanings to cultural practices and providing alternative forms of knowledge, approaches andway(s) of explaining. In terms of re-interpretation and reconstruction of concepts, principles and processes, an important issue for research intotraditional healthcare is the use of foreign languages whichcompletely distorted certain traditional cultural practices. Thereare no adequate English language equivalence for certain tradi - tional concepts and principles. For instance, the traditional the - ories of ill-health as being external and largely attributable to an - gry ancestral spirits or their human agents would need to be re-interpreted to reflect the fact that these so-called \"angry an - cestral spirits and or human agents\" could be nothing more than the contextual socio-economic and other environmental condi - tions which put people in competition with one another and are responsible for putting people at risk of ill-health. The notion ofancestral spirits would have to be reinterpreted since in actualfact these are largely legacies and or strong traditional valuesleft behind by legendary ancestors and not real spirits in the or-dinary interpretation. These legacies have implications for life-style choices which are health promoting as living descendantsconsider inculcating the exemplary behaviours and values oftheir ancestors and as some of these behaviours serve as mod-els and or motives for decisions and or choices making. The rit-ual ceremonies should no more be seen as ancestral or devilworship but simply as procedures used for modifying human be-haviours, procedures employed to mediate harsh environmen - tal conditions, or as procedures for facilitating and encouraging people to rethink human relationships from rather being com - petitive to being collaborative and as sources of support and av - enues for learning new human relationships and coping skills. There is no doubt that the success of integration will dependlargely on collaborative research works between western-ori - ented and traditional healers. The latter would also need educa - tion in helping them to view their practices in completely new ways and training to cooperate with western-orientedpractitioners.
