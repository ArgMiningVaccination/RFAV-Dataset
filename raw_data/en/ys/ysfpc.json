This study explored the relationship between thermal comfort and respiratory immunity in an air-conditioning environment. SIgA and lysozyme were selected as the biomarkers, and subjective questionnaires were collected after airflow intervention. Spearman rank correlation test was used to analyze the correlation between the biomarkers and subjective thermal questionnaires, and Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare differences of immune biomarkers between and after tests. The results showed that when the supplied air was 1m/s and 24\u00b0C, the lysozyme concentration significantly decreased from 835.01ng/ml to 434.16ng/ml after tests (p<0.01). In addition, the lysozyme concentration after tests showed a significantly positive correlation with TSV ( Rs =0.527, P <0.05), and the colder subjects felt, the greater the lysozyme change rate deceased. There were no correlations between SIgA and TSV after tests ( P >0.05). This work revealed that discomfort of human bodies represents the low levels of respiratory immunity.
