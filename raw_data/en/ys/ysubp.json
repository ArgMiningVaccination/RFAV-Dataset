Your Employer restated the Plan by signing a complex legal agreement - the Plan document - which contains all of the provisions that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires. The Plan document must follow certain federal laws and regulations that apply to retirement plans. The Plan document may change as new or revised laws or regulations take effect. Your Employer also has the right to modify certain features of the Plan from time to time. You will be notified about changes affecting your rights under the Plan. This Summary Plan Description (SPD) summarizes the important features of the Plan document, including your benefits and obligations under the Plan. If you want more detailed information regarding certain plan features or have questions about the information contained in this SPD, you should contact your Employer. You may also examine a copy of the plan document by making arrangements with your Employer. Certain terms in the SPD have a special meaning when used in the Plan. These terms are capitalized throughout the SPD and are defined in more detail in the DEFINITIONS section of the SPD. If any information in this SPD conflicts with the terms of the Plan document adopted by your Employer, the terms of the Plan document - not this SPD - will govern. All dollars contributed to the Plan will be invested either in annuity contracts or in mutual funds held in custodial accounts. The agreements constituting or governing the annuity contracts and custodial accounts (the \"Individual Agreements\") explain your rights under the contracts and accounts and the unique rules that apply to each Plan investment which may, in some cases, limit your options under the Plan. For example, the Individual Agreement may contain a provision which prohibit loans, even if the Plan generally allows loans. If this is the case, you would not be able to take a loan from the accumulation in an investment option governed by that Individual Agreement. You should review the Individual Agreements along with this SPD to gain a full understanding of your rights and obligations under the Plan. Contact your Employer or the investment vendor to obtain copies of the Individual Agreements or to receive more information regarding the investment options available under the Plan.

DEFINITIONS ELIGIBILITY Am I eligible to participate in the Plan? You will be eligible to contribute a portion of your pay to the Plan as a pre-tax Deferral or Nondeductible Employee Contribution, unless you fall into one of the following categories of excluded employees. You are a student enrolled and attending classes offered by your Employer and your Employer is a school, college or university. You will be eligible to participate in the Plan and receive contributions made by your Employer after meeting certain requirements described below, unless you fall into one of the following categories of excluded employees. You are a student enrolled and attending classes offered by your Employer and your Employer is a school, college, or university. You are Grant assistant. The Plan document is being amended or restated on to new Plan documents. If you were eligible to participate in the prior plan, you will continue to be eligible to participate in this Plan without satisfying any additional age or service requirements. What requirements do I have to meet before I am eligible to participate in the Plan? Unless you fall into one of the categories of excluded employees, you will be immediately eligible (or required) to: contribute a portion of your pay as a pre-tax Deferral or Nondeductible Employee Contribution into the Plan Unless you are part of an excluded class of employees, you must reach age 21 before you will be eligible to receive contributions made by your Employer. However, there is no age requirement for contributing a portion of your Compensation as a pre-tax Deferral or Nondeductible Employee Contribution. The age requirement listed above, however, will apply to pre-tax Deferrals only if you can defer pre-tax or Roth Deferrals into another plan maintained by your Employer that does not have any age and service requirements. Unless you are part of an excluded class of employees, you must complete: ERISA 403(b) \u00a92008 Date: 8/16/2017 2 consecutive year(s) of service with the Employer before you are eligible to receive contributions made by your Employer. However, there is no years of service requirement for contributing a portion of your Compensation as a pre-tax Deferral or Nondeductible Employee Contribution. The years of service requirement listed above, however, will apply to pre-tax Deferrals only if you can defer pre-tax or Roth Deferrals into another plan maintained by your Employer that does not have any age and service requirements. Your initial eligibility measuring period will be the 12-month period beginning with your hire date. If you do not satisfy the eligibility requirements during that first measuring period, eligibility will be calculated based on a 12-month period beginning with the anniversary of your hire date. You will be credited with a year of service if you work at least 1,000 hours for your Employer during the eligibility measuring period. When can I enter the Plan? DeferralandNondeductible Employee Contributions You will be able to contribute a portion of your pay into the Plan as a pre-tax Deferral or Nondeductible Employee Contribution as soon as administratively feasible after your hire date. Employer Contributions Once you have met the age and service requirements listed above, you will enter the Plan the first day of the next month and become eligible to receive Employer Contributions from your Employer. What happens to my Plan eligibility if I terminate my employment and am later rehired? Once you satisfy the eligibility requirements and enter the Plan, you will continue to participate while you are still employed by the Employer, even if you have a break in eligibility service. A break in service occurs when you do not work more than 500 hours. If you had not yet satisfied the eligibility requirements and had a break in eligibility service, periods before your break in service will not be taken into account and you will have to satisfy the eligibility requirements following your break in service. Periods during which you have a break in eligibility service will not count against you if you were absent because you were pregnant, had a child or adopted a child, were serving in the military, or provided service during a national emergency and re-employment is protected under federal or state law, and you return to employment within the time required by law. If you terminate employment and are later rehired, you will be able to contribute a portion of your Compensation as a Deferral or Nondeductible Employee Contribution as soon as administratively feasible after being rehired. If you had met the eligibility requirements for Employer Contributions and were a Participant in the Plan before terminating employment or having a break in eligibility service, and are later rehired, you will enter the Plan immediately. If you were not a Participant before the break in eligibility service, and are rehired, you will need to again satisfy the Plan's eligibility requirements for Employer Contributions. ERISA 403(b) \u00a92008 Generated Date: 8/16/2017CONTRIBUTIONS & VESTING What amount can I contribute to the Plan? Deferrals You will be able to contribute a portion of your Compensation as a pre-tax Deferral unless you are a member of one of the excluded classes listed previously. The maximum dollar amount that you can contribute to the Plan each year is $18,000 for 2017 and includes contributions you make to certain other deferral plans (e.g., other 401(k) plans, salary deferral SEP plans, and 403(b) tax-sheltered annuity plans). This amount will increase as the cost of living increases. Deferrals (and the related earnings) are always fully vested and cannot be forfeited. So if you were to leave your Employer, you would be entitled to the full Deferral balance (plus earnings). The amount of your Compensation that you decide to defer into the Plan generally will be contributed on a pre-tax basis. That means that, unlike the compensation that you actually receive, the pre-tax contribution (and all of the earnings accumulated while it is invested in the Plan) will not be taxed at the time it is paid by your Employer. Instead, it will be taxable to you when you take a payout from the Plan. These contributions will reduce your taxable income each year that you make a contribution but will be treated as compensation for Social Security taxes. EXAMPLE: Assume your Compensation is $25,000 per year. You decide to contribute five percent of your Compensation into the Plan. Your Employer will pay you $23,750 as gross taxable income and will deposit $1,250 (five percent) into the Plan. You will not pay federal income taxes on the $1,250 (plus earnings on the $1,250) until you withdraw it from the Plan. Catch-up Contributions Age 50 Catch-up Contributions - If you are eligible to make Deferrals and you turn age 50 before the end of any calendar year, you may defer up to an extra $6,000 each year (for 2017) into the Plan as a pre-tax contribution once you meet certain Plan limits. The maximum catch-up amount may increase as the cost of living increases. Special 403(b) Catch-up Contributions - If you have worked at least 15 years for the Employer, and the Employer is a qualified organization, you may make a special catch-up contribution equal to the smallest of the three amounts listed below: 1. $3,000 2. $15,000 minus the amount of Special 403(b) Catch-Up Contributions made in prior years 3. ($5,000 times the number of years you have worked for the Employer) minus (the total amount of Deferrals made while you worked for the Employer) These catch-up contributions will be eligible for Matching Contributions from your Employer (if any). If you qualify for both the age 50 catch-up contributions and the special 403(b) catch-up contributions, your catch-up contributions will be allocated first as special 403(b) catch-up contributions. Catch-up contributions (and the related earnings) are considered Deferrals and are always fully vested. So if you were to leave your Employer, you would be entitled to the full catch-up balance (plus earnings). ERISA 403(b) \u00a92008 Generated Date: 8/16/2017Nondeductible Employee Contributions Unless you are part of an excluded class of Employees, you may contribute a portion of your Compensation into the plan as a Nondeductible Employee Contribution. Nondeductible Employee Contributions are contributed to the Plan from amounts that have already been treated as taxable income. These contributions will not reduce your taxable income in the year in which you contribute a portion of your Compensation into the Plan but will be tax-free when distributed from the Plan. Earnings on Nondeductible Employee Contributions will not be taxed until you take a distribution from the Plan. EXAMPLE: Your Compensation is $25,000 per year. You decide to contribute 5% of your Compensation into the Plan as a Nondeductible Employee Contribution. Your Employer will pay you $23,750 as income and will deposit $1,250 (5%) into the Plan. You will pay taxes on the entire $25,000. When you withdraw the $1,250 contribution plus earnings from the Plan, only the earnings portion will be taxable to you. Nondeductible Employee Contributions (and the related earnings) are always fully vested and cannot be forfeited. So if you were to leave your Employer, you would be entitled to the full Nondeductible Employee Contribution balance (plus earnings). You may also request a distribution of Nondeductible Employee Contributions (and the related earnings) while you are still employed, so long as the distribution is permitted under the Individual Agreement. How do I start making contributions? To begin deferring a portion of your Compensation into the Plan, you must follow the procedures established by your Employer. What if I don't make a specific election to contribute some of my Compensation into the Plan? You are not required to defer a portion of your Compensation into the Plan. If you elect 0% or you simply fail to follow the procedures established by your Employer for making a Deferral election, you will not be enrolled in the Plan as a deferring Participant (i.e., 0% of your Compensation will be deferred into the Plan). Can I change my contribution rate or stop making Deferrals after I start participating in the Plan? You may change the amount you are deferring into the Plan or stop making Deferrals altogether at the times determined by your Employer. Generally, once you stop your Deferrals, you will not be able to reenroll in the Plan and begin making Deferrals again until the first day of the next Plan Year, or the first day of the seventh month of the Plan Year, unless your Employer decides to allow more frequent re-entry. Example: Assume the Plan Year is the calendar year and you are enrolled in the Plan and deferring 6% of your Compensation into the Plan as a pre-tax Deferral. On October 1 you decide to stop making Deferrals. You will not be able to re-enter and begin making Deferrals again until January 1. What if I contribute too much to the Plan? If you contribute too much to the Plan as a Deferral, you must take the excess amount (plus any earnings on the excess) out of the Plan by April 15 of the year following the year the money was contributed to the Plan. You must notify your Employer, in writing, of the excess amount by March 1 and request that it be removed. The excess amount is taxable to you in the year you ERISA 403(b) \u00a92008 Ascensus, Generated Date: 8/16/2017contributed it to the Plan. If you do not remove it by the deadline, additional taxes will apply. Will the Employer make any additional contributions to the Plan? The Employer will make Employer Contributions to the Plan each year. The Employer Contributions made by the Employer to the Plan will be allocated using a business location or job classification formula. Under this formula, your Employer Contribution will vary depending upon the classification outlined below. Classification Percentage of Compensation Eligible Employees earning up to $54,0009 Eligibile Employees earning greater than $54,000 and up to $160,0008 Eligible Employees earning greater than $160,0007 To qualify to receive an Employer Contribution, you must satisfy the eligibility requirements for Employer Contributions and must also work 1000 service hours during the Plan Year. If you are on a paid leave of absence from your Employer, you will still be eligible to receive an Employer Contribution based on the Compensation received during the leave. If I have money in other retirement plans, can I combine them with my accumulation under this Plan? Your Employer may allow you to roll over dollars you have saved in other retirement arrangements into this Plan after you become eligible to participate in the Plan. Your Employer will provide you with the documents or other information you need to determine whether your prior plan balance is qualified to be rolled into this Plan. The Plan will accept amounts rolled over from the prior plan to this Plan if the prior plan was a: qualified retirement plan (e.g., 401(k) plan, profit sharing plan, money purchase pension plan, target benefit plan) 403(b) tax-sheltered annuity plan government 457(b) plan Traditional IRA Participants and/or beneficiaries who received 2009 RMDs and extended RMDs distributed for 2009 were allowed to roll those distributions over into this plan in accordance with the rollover contributions rules listed above. ERISA 403(b) \u00a92008 Ascensus, Generated Date: 8/16/2017Rollover contributions are always 100 percent vested and nonforfeitable. Are there any limits on how much can be contributed for me? In addition to the Deferral limit described previously, you may not have total contributions (including Deferrals) of more than $54,000, plus any age 50 catch-up contributions, in 2017 or an amount equal to 100% of your Compensation, whichever is less, allocated to the Plan for your benefit each year. The $54,000 limit will be increased as the cost of living increases, and is the total amount that can be contributed across all retirement plans sponsored by your Employer. Will contributions be made for me if I am called to military service? If you are reemployed by your Employer after completing military service, you may be entitled to receive certain make-up contributions from your Employer. If your Plan permits Deferrals or Nondeductible Employee Contributions, you may also have the option of making up missed employee contributions and receiving a Matching Contribution, if applicable, on these contributions. If you are reemployed after military service, contact your Plan Administrator for more information about your options under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA). Will I be able to keep my Employer contributions if I terminate employment or am no longer eligible to participate in the Plan? Contributions that you receive from your Employer will always be fully vested and cannot be forfeited, even if you terminate employment or become ineligible to participate in the Plan. INVESTING YOUR PLAN ACCOUNT What investments are permitted? Your Employer (or someone appointed by your Employer) will select the investment vendors and investment options that will be available under the Plan. The investment options will be limited to annuity contracts and mutual funds purchased through a custodial account. The list of approved investment options and vendors may change from time to time as your Employer considers appropriate. Your Employer may restrict the list of vendors who may accept new contributions to the Plan and it may be different from the list of vendors and investment options available once the contributions have been made to the Plan through a contract exchange. You should carefully review the Individual Agreements governing the annuity contracts and custodial accounts, the prospectus, or other available information before making investment decisions. Who is responsible for selecting the investments for my contributions under the Plan? You have the right to decide how your Plan balance will be invested. Your Employer will establish administrative procedures that you must follow to select your investments. Your Employer will designate a list of vendors and investment options that you may select for new contributions to the Plan. You will have the ability to transfer your Plan balance among these vendors and investment options, to the extent permitted by the Individual Agreements. Contact your Employer if you are not certain whether ERISA 403(b) \u00a92008 Ascensus, Generated Date: 8/16/2017a particular vendor or investment option is permitted under the Plan. If you do not select investments for your Plan account, the Employer will determine how your account will be invested. Your Employer intends to operate this Plan in compliance with Section 404(c) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), and Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations Section 2550.404c-1. This means that your Employer and others in charge of the Plan will not be responsible for any losses that result from investment instructions given by you or your beneficiary. How frequently can I change my investment elections? You may change your initial investment selections as frequently as permitted under the Individual Agreements. WITHDRAWING MONEY FROM THE PLAN (AND LOANS) When can I take a distribution from the plan? You may always request a distribution of contributions you have received from your Employer upon termination of employment after reaching age 65. You may request a distribution of Deferrals at the times listed below. You terminate employment You become Disabled When you reach age 59\u00bd When you reach age 65 On account of hardship You may request a distribution of the contributions you receive from your Employer at the times listed below, if they are invested in annuity contracts. You terminate employment You become Disabled You may request a distribution of the contributions you receive from your Employer at the times listed below, if they are invested in custodial accounts. You terminate employment You become Disabled ERISA 403(b) \u00a92008 Ascensus, Generated Date: 8/16/2017In general, you may elect a distribution at any time of your Nondeductible Employee Contributions subject to the restrictions in the Individual Agreements. However, distributions of Nondeductible Employee Contributions invested in a custodial account may generally not be distributed to you until you have terminated employment, become disabled or reach age 59\u00bd. You may elect a distribution of your transfer contributions and/or rollover contributions at any time subject to the restrictions in the Individual Agreements. Hardship If you experience a financial hardship, you may take a distribution from the Deferrals you have contributed to the Plan, unless restricted under the terms of the Individual Agreements. The following events qualify as a hardship distribution under the Plan: medical expenses for you, your spouse or your dependents, or your beneficiary, payment to purchase your principal residence, tuition and education-related expenses for you, your spouse or your dependents, or your beneficiary payments to prevent eviction from your principal residence, funeral expenses for you, your spouse or your dependents, or your beneficiary, payments to repair your principal residence that would qualify for a casualty loss deduction. Before you take a hardship distribution, you must take all other distributions and all nontaxable loans available to you under the Plan. If you take a hardship distribution of Deferrals, you may not be eligible to make Deferrals and/or Nondeductible Employee Contributions for the next six months. If you are under age 59\u00bd, the amount you take out of the Plan as a hardship distribution may be subject to a 10 percent penalty tax. This is only required under the safe harbor method of determining hardship. You may be able to take a penalty-free distribution from your Deferrals if you were called to active military duty after September 11, 2001. In order to qualify for these penalty-free distributions, you must have been ordered or called to active duty for a period of at least 180 days or an indefinite period and your distribution must have been taken after you were called to duty and before your active duty ended. Effective 01/01/2009, if you are on active duty in the uniformed services for a period of more than 30 days, you may elect to take a distribution of your Deferrals from the Plan without severing from employment with your Employer. However, if you choose to take distributions under this provision, you will not be permitted to make Deferrals, Nondeductible Contributions and/or Mandatory Employee Contributions to the Plan during the six-month period beginning on the date of the distribution. ERISA 403(b) \u00a92008 Ascensus, Generated Date: 8/16/2017The Individual Agreements governing the investment options that you selected for your Plan contributions may contain additional limits on when you can take a distribution, the form of distribution that may be available as well as your right to transfer among approved investment options. Please review both the following information in this Summary Plan Description and the terms of your annuity contracts or custodial agreements before requesting a distribution. Contact your Employer or the investment vendor if you have questions regarding your distribution options. How do I request a payout? You must complete a payout request form provided or approved by your Employer or follow other procedures established by your Employer for processing distributions. If you are taking a hardship distribution, you must provide documents to verify that you have a hardship event that qualifies for a Plan distribution. If you die, become Disabled, or reach age 65 and you qualify for and request a distribution, your distribution will begin as soon as administratively feasible after the date you (or your beneficiary in the case of your death) request a distribution. If you terminate your employment and you qualify for and request a distribution, your distribution will begin as soon as administratively feasible after the date you (or your beneficiary in the case of your death) request a distribution. If I am married, does my spouse have to approve my distributions from the Plan? If you are married, you must get written consent from your spouse to take a distribution from the Plan in any form other than a qualified joint and survivor annuity. Your spouse's consent is also needed if you want to name someone other than your spouse as your beneficiary. The annuity would need to be structured to provide a benefit while you are both alive and then to provide a survivor benefit that is equal to 50 percent of the amount you received while you were both living. You can designate a different survivor percentage subject to certain limits under the qualified optional survivor annuity regulations. Your Employer will provide you with more information regarding your annuity options when it comes time for you to make a decision. Follow the procedures established by your Employer to document your spouse's consent to waive the annuity and take the payment in some other form permitted by the Plan. Your spouse must also consent to any Plan loans that you request. Your spouse's consent may have been required to either stop required payments for 2009, begin payments again in 2010, or both. Your Plan Administrator can tell you whether spousal consent was needed to stop and/or re-start required minimum distributions. How will my money be distributed to me if I request a payout from the Plan? If you obtain the proper consents, you may choose from the following options for your payout. Lump sum Partial payments Installment payments ERISA 403(b) \u00a92008 Ascensus, Generated Date: 8/16/2017 Annuity contract (if assets are held in a custodial account) or converted to an income option (if your assets are invested in an annuity contract) The Individual Agreements governing the investment options that you selected for your contributions may further restrict your payout options. Please review the annuity contracts or custodial agreements before requesting a distribution and contact your Employer or the investment vendor if you have questions regarding your distribution options. If your distribution is eligible to be rolled over, you may choose to have your distribution paid to another eligible retirement arrangement. Contact your Employer for information regarding rollover procedures. Do any penalties or restrictions apply to my payouts? Generally, if you take a payout from the Plan before you are age 59\u00bd, a 10 percent early distribution penalty will apply to the taxable portion of your payout. There are some exceptions to the 10 percent penalty. Your tax adviser can assist you in determining whether you qualify for a penalty exception. If your payout is eligible to be rolled over, 20 percent of the taxable portion of your payout will be withheld and remitted to the IRS as a credit toward the taxes you will owe on the payout amount unless you do a direct rollover. EXAMPLE: You request a $10,000 payout from the pre-tax portion of your Plan balance. If the amount is eligible to be rolled over to another plan, but you choose not to roll it over directly, you will receive $8,000 and $2,000 will be remitted to the IRS. Can I take a loan from the Plan? Although the Plan is designed primarily to help you save for retirement, you may take a loan from the Plan as outlined below, subject to the terms and restrictions in the Individual Agreements. Please review your annuity contracts or custodial agreements before requesting a loan. Contact your Employer or the investment vendor if you have questions regarding your loan options. The Individual Agreements governing the investment options that you selected for your Plan contributions may contain additional limits on when you can take a loan. Please review both the following information in this Summary Plan Description and your annuity contracts or custodial agreements before requesting a loan. Contact your Employer or the investment vendor if you have questions regarding your loan options. Generally the minimum loan amount that you may take is $1,000 and the maximum loan amount is $50,000. The maximum amount you can borrow may be less, however, depending on two factors: 1) the amount of your accumulation under the Plan, and 2) whether you have taken other loans from any of this Employer's plans within the last year. If you have not had a plan loan in the previous year, your maximum loan cannot be greater than one-half of your vested account balance or $50,000, whichever is less. If you have had another loan, the $50,000 maximum will be reduced by the highest outstanding loan balance in the 12 month period prior to the new loan. If your loan is being taken from a TIAA-CREF Annuity, your maximum loan amount is further limited to 1) 45% of your combined TIAA and CREF accumulation attributable to participation under \u00a92008 90% or your CREF and TIAA Real Estate accumulation attributable to participation under this Plan for Retirement Loan (RL) loans or 3) 90% of your TIAA Annuity accumulation attributable to participation under this Plan for a Group Supplemental Retirement Annuity (GSRA) loan. If you default on a loan, your right to a future loan may be restricted. Further, the maximum amount that you can borrow from the Plan will be reduced by the amount in default (plus interest) until the defaulted amount can be deducted from your Plan accumulation. If more than one employer contributed to your TIAA-CREF Annuities, you can only take loans based on the amount you accumulated under this Employer's plan. You should check with your other employers for the rules that apply to loans from the amounts you accumulated while working for the other employers. If your loan is based on amounts invested in your TIAA-CREF mutual funds, you may not have more than three loans at any one time (from all plans of all employers). You will be permitted to have an unlimited number of loans outstanding at any time, unless further limited by investments as noted above. The maximum amount you may borrow from the Plan is also limited to the portion of your plan balance that consists of the following types of contributions: pre-tax Deferrals but only unmatched Nondeductible Employee Contributions but only if unmatched If your loan is used to purchase a primary residence, you must repay it within ten years. Other loans must be repaid within one to five years. How do I apply for a loan? To apply for a loan you must complete the loan application provided (or approved) by your Employer and pay any applicable loan fees. What is the interest rate for my loan? The interest rate for your loan will vary, as described below, depending upon how your retirement balance is invested. Group Supplemental Retirement Unit-Annuity (GSRA) contract - The interest rate is variable and can increase or decrease every three months. The interest rate you pay initially will be the higher of 1) the Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average for the calendar month ending two months before your loan is issued; or 2) the interest rate credited before your annuity starting date, as stated in the applicable rate schedule, plus 1 percent. Thereafter, the rate may change quarterly, but only if the new rate differs from your current rate by at least \u00bd percent. Retirement Loan (RL) contract - For all Employers except those located in Arkansas, Hawaii, or New Jersey, the interest rate you pay initially will be the higher of 1) the Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average for the calendar month ending two months before your loan is issued; or 2) the interest credited before your annuity starting date, ERISA 403(b) \u00a92008 Ascensus, Generated Date: 8/16/2017as stated in the applicable rate schedule, plus 1 percent. Thereafter the rate will change annually, but only if the Moody's Corporate Bond Yield Average for the calendar month ending two months before the anniversary of your loan differs from your current rate by at least a half percent. If the latest average differs by less, your interest rate will remain the same for the next year. For Employers located in Arkansas, Hawaii, or New Jersey, the interest rate will be a fixed rate of 8 percent. TIAA-CREF mutual funds - The interest rate for loans from TIAA-CREF mutual funds will be fixed for the term of the loan and will be equal to the Federal Reserve Board Bank prime loan rate plus 1 percent at the time of the loan origination. What if I don't repay my loan? You will be required to repay the loan amount (plus interest) to the Plan. If you default on the loan, you will be taxed on the amount of the outstanding loan balance and will be subject to a 10 percent penalty if you are under age 59\u00bd. In addition, your Employer has the right to foreclose its security interest in the portion of your vested account under the Plan that you pledged as security for the loan, when an event allowing a Plan distribution occurs. The following events will cause a loan default: Not repaying your loan as set forth in your loan agreement. Breaching any of your obligations under your loan agreement. Severing your employment (for loans from mutual funds in custodial accounts) If your loan is defaulted, your Employer has the right to foreclose the security interest in your vested account balance pledged for repayment, when an event which triggers a distribution of your benefits occurs. In addition, the loan administrator will report the loan default to the IRS and the outstanding loan amount and accrued interest will be treated as a taxable distribution. If you are under age 59\u00bd, this could result in a 10 percent penalty on the taxable portion of the default. What if I die before receiving all of my money from the Plan? If you die before taking all of your assets from the Plan, the remaining balance will be paid to your designated beneficiary. To designate your beneficiary, you must follow the procedures established by your Employer. If you are married and decide to name someone other than your spouse as your beneficiary, your spouse must consent in writing to your designation. It is important to review your designation from time to time and update it if your circumstances change (e.g., a divorce, death of a named beneficiary). If you do not name a beneficiary, 50% of your balance will be paid to your spouse and 50% will be paid to your estate. If you do not name a beneficiary and have no surviving spouse, your remaining balance in the Plan will be paid to your estate, unless a different alternative is provided in the Individual Agreement. If your Plan balance is $5,000 or less at the time of your death, your beneficiary will generally have the same options regarding the form of the distribution that are available to you as a Participant. If the balance is greater than $5,000, your beneficiary may be required to take the payouts in the form of a life annuity, unless the annuity has been properly waived by you and your spouse during your lifetime. Your beneficiary may also have the option of rolling their distribution into an IRA. The Individual ERISA 403(b) \u00a92008 Ascensus, Generated Date: 8/16/2017Agreements governing the investment options that you selected for your contributions may further restrict your beneficiary's options regarding the manner in which the accumulation will be distributed. If you die after beginning age 70\u00bd distributions, as described in the following question, your beneficiary must continue taking distributions from the plan at least annually. If you die before beginning age 70\u00bd payments, your beneficiary may have the option of (1) taking annual payments beginning the year following your death (or the year you would have reached age 70\u00bd, if your spouse is your beneficiary), or (2) delaying their distribution until the year containing the fifth anniversary of your death, provided they take the entire amount remaining during that fifth year. Effective beginning 2009, if you are a beneficiary using the five-year rule for distributions of your benefits, 2009 does not count toward determining the end of the five-year period. For example, if the participant died in 2007, you will have until December 31, 2013, instead of December 31, 2012, to deplete your account under the Plan. How long can I leave the money in my Plan? How long you can leave your money in the Plan varies depending on your Plan balance and whether you are still employed. Balanceof$1,000orless If your vested balance at the time you terminate from employment is $1,000 or less, you must take it out of the Plan when you terminate employment. If you do not tell your Employer what to do with your account under the Plan (e.g., roll it over to an IRA), your Employer will distribute your Plan account as a lump sum. Balancebetween$1,000and$5000 If your balance is between $1,000 and $5,000, you must take your vested balance from the Plan or your Employer will roll it over to an IRA that is established for you. Balancegreaterthan$5,000 If your balance is greater than $5,000, even if you terminate service, you are generally not required to take a payout from the Plan until the age 70\u00bd required distribution rules apply to you. Rollover Contributions will be included in determining your balance for these purposes. Age70\u00bdRequired Distributions When you reach age 70\u00bd you will generally need to begin taking a distribution each year based on your balance in the Plan. However, unless you own more than 5% of the Employer, you can delay required distributions until you actually separate from service. Contributions for periods before 1987 (excluding earnings on those contributions) will generally not be subject to the required distribution rules until you reach age 75. You may also have the option to satisfy your required minimum distribution from the Plan by aggregating all your 403(b) plans and taking the required minimum distribution from any one or more of the individual 403(b) plans. Effective for 2009, you may have chosen whether or not to take your required minimum distribution for 2009. If you did not ERISA 403(b) \u00a92008 Ascensus, Generated Date: 8/16/2017make that choice, the Employer retained that amount within the Plan. Effective for 2009, you may have chosen to roll over your 2009 and/or extended 2009 required minimum distribution to another eligible retirement arrangement. What if the Plan is terminated? If the Plan is terminated, your entire account balance will be distributed from the Plan. To the extent you are invested in an annuity contract, you will receive a distribution of the contract. ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION AND RIGHTS UNDER ERISA Who established the Plan? The official name of the Plan is Lake Forest College Retirement Plan for Faculty and Staff The Employer who adopted the Plan is: Lake Forest College 555 North Sheridan Road Lake Forest, IL 60045-2399 847-735-5035 Federal Tax Identification Number: 36-2167770 Fiscal Year End: 05/31 Your Employer has assigned Number 001 to the Plan. The Plan is a 403(b) defined contribution plan, which means that contributions to the Plan made on your behalf (and earnings) will be separately accounted for within the Plan. When did the Plan become effective? Your Employer has amended and restated the Lake Forest College Retirement Plan for Faculty and Staff which was originally adopted 09/01/1938. The effective date of this amended Plan is 06/01/2017. Who is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Plan? Your Employer is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Plan. To assist in operating the Plan efficiently and accurately, your Employer may appoint others to act on its behalf or to perform certain functions. Who pays the expenses associated with operating the Plan? All reasonable Plan administration expenses including those involved in retaining necessary professional assistance, may be paid from the assets of the Plan, to the extent permitted by the Individual Agreements. These expenses may be allocated among you and all other Plan participants or, for expenses directly related to you, charged against your account balance. Examples of ERISA 403(b) \u00a92008 Ascensus, Generated Date: 8/16/2017expenses that may be directly related to you include, general recordkeeping fees and expenses related to processing your distributions or loans (if applicable), qualified domestic relations orders, and your ability to direct the investment of your Plan balance, if applicable. Finally, the Employer may, in its discretion, pay any or all of these expenses. For example, the employer may pay expenses for current employees, but may deduct the expenses of former employees directly from their accounts. Your Employer will provide you with a summary of all Plan expenses and the method of payment of the expenses upon request. Does the Employer have the right to change the Plan? The Plan will be amended from time to time to incorporate changes required by the law and regulations governing retirement plans. Your Employer also has the right to amend the Plan to add new features or to change or eliminate various provisions. An Employer cannot amend the Plan to take away or reduce protected benefits under the Plan (e.g., the Employer cannot reduce the vesting percentage that applies to your current balance in the Plan). Does participation in the Plan provide any legal rights regarding my employment? The Plan does not intend to, and does not provide, any additional rights to employment or constitute a contract for employment. The purpose of the Summary Plan Description is to help you understand how the Plan operates and the benefits available to you under the Plan. The Plan document is the controlling legal document with respect to the operation of and rights granted under the Plan and if there are any inconsistencies between this Summary Plan Description and the Plan document, the Plan document will be followed. Can creditors or other individuals request a payout from my Plan balance? Creditors (other than the IRS) and others generally may not request a distribution from your Plan balance. One major exception to this rule is that your Employer may distribute or reallocate your benefits in response to a qualified domestic relations order. A qualified domestic relations order is an order or decree issued by a court that requires you to pay child support or alimony or to give a portion of your Plan account to an ex-spouse or legally separated spouse. Your Employer will review the order to ensure that it meets certain criteria before any money is paid from your account. You (or your beneficiary) may obtain, at no charge, a copy of the procedures your Employer will use for reviewing and qualifying domestic relations orders. How do I file a claim? To claim a benefit that you are entitled to under the Plan, you must file a written request with your Employer. The claim must set forth the reasons you believe you are eligible to receive benefits and you must authorize the Employer to conduct any necessary examinations and take the steps to evaluate the claim. What if my claim is denied? Except as described below, if your claim is denied, your Employer will provide you (or your beneficiary) with a written notice of the denial within 90 days of the date your claim was filed.

The 45-day time period may be extended by the Plan for up to 30 days if the Employer determines that an extension is necessary due to matters beyond the control of the Plan. The Employer will notify you, before the end of the 45-day period, of the reason(s) for the extension and the date by which the Plan expects to make a decision regarding your claim.

The notice will specifically explain the standards on which the approval of your claim will be based, the unresolved issues that prevent a decision on your claim, and the additional information needed to resolve those issues. You will have at least 45 days within which to provide the specified information. The period of time within which approval or denial of your claim is required to be made generally begins at the time your claim is filed. If the period of time is extended because you fail to submit information necessary to decide your claim, the period for approving or denying your claim will not include the period of time between the date on which the notification of the extension is sent to you and the date on which you provide the additional information. Your Employer will provide you with written or electronic notification if your claim is denied. The notification will provide the following: i. The specific reason or reasons for the denial; ii. Reference to the specific section of the Plan on which the denial is based; iii.

In such a case, the court may require the Employer to provide the materials and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the Employer. If you have a claim for benefits which is denied, or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file suit in a state or Federal court. In addition, if you disagree with the Plan's decision or lack there of concerning the qualified status of a domestic relations order or a medical child support order, you may file suit in Federal court.

The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees. If you are successful, the court may order the person you have sued to pay the costs and fees. If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees, for example, if the court finds your claim is frivolous.
