In fact, most vaccine side effects involve the immune system reacting poorly to the vaccine. Ensuring a healthy immune system is one way we can help decrease a child's risk of a vaccine reaction and optimize response. At Knox Wellness, we provide support for before and after vaccination to guarantee a healthy and functioning immune system in children of all ages. Here, we believe it is important to provide as much information as possible, so our patients can decide what's best for them and their family. [Contact Knox Wellness today](/contact-us/) to schedule a consultation with our medical team and find out how our vaccine support services can help maintain your child's overall wellness. "}
