As some people are still waiting to be vaccinated, and, with news of upcoming booster shots for those already vaccinated, some tips on preparing for the vaccine and feeling better afterwards will be welcome. Before your vaccine: Beginning at least 48 hours before your vaccine you should make sure you are well rested, very well hydrated, and avoid consuming alcohol. Acupuncture treatment can be considered in the days before your vaccine to help you feel your best. After your vaccine: Stay really well hydrated, continue to avoid alcohol. Plan for some time off to rest as you may experience the stated symptoms of the immune response following the vaccine. Refer to the booklet provided when you receive your vaccine to know what symptoms to expect. If you experience severe symptoms/symptoms not listed/symptoms lasting more than 2 days you should seek medical attention. The vast majority of people experience either very mild, or no symptoms at all. The good news: The vaccination programmes have been closely monitored continuously around the world, with ongoing reporting of any adverse reactions to ensure that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks. The number of severe adverse reactions has been very low. There are some conditions and symptoms that have occured in individuals following the vaccination, that, because they also occur spontaneously, may or may not have been directly caused by the vaccine. Those which acupuncture is known to be helpful in treating are listed below: - Menstrual irregularities: early period, very heavy bleeding, missed period. - Shingles - Muscle pain and weakness - Migraine and headache - Tinnitus and ear pain - Urticaria and rash - Hair loss - Stomach pain and digestive issues - Flare up of already existing autoimmune conditions - Bell's palsy So far, the vaccines have been found to be very effective for reducing the probability of serious illness or hospitalisation from Covid-19. Here in Ireland, uptake of the vaccine has been high, showing that the majority of people here care about protecting themselves and those around them. There have been some reports that people suffering with Long Covid have experienced an improvement in their symptoms following vaccination.
