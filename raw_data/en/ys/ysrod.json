I have had an incredibly positive experience with Homeopathy. I came to see Sam after a stressful period in my life, suffering from acute IBS and anxiety attacks. Since taking the homeopathic remedies my IBS has decreased dramatically and I no longer feel debilitated by my anxiety. The homeopathy treats the emotional as well as physical problems and I generally feel calmer and more centred in myself. Sam is amazing! She gets to the heart of things and I felt very comfortable discussing personal issues with her. I would recommend her without hesitation. Homeopathy works; I have seen the results. NM, West Hampstead (IBS) I saw Samantha for my daughter's eczema and quite bad chest cough. After the first visit the cough was gone completely. Treatment took about two weeks and her eczema reduced by 30%, then after the second visit by 50%. She is still on remedies Samantha gave us and it looks like it is getting a lot better.
