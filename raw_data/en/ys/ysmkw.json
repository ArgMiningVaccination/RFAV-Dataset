This is often a time to reconnect with family and loved ones, to attend social events, and celebrate your beliefs. -Unfortunately, it can also be a time of extra commitments, nonstop activity, and pressure to get it all done. This can result in a lot of stress, both mental and physical. Everyone feels stressed occasionally, but when it continues for a long time or gets overwhelming, it can take a real toll on your health. Our bodies are particularly sensitive to the effects of stress, which can cause a weak immune system, weight gain, headaches, anxiety, depression, high blood pressure, joint pain and digestive disorders. The good news is that you can take charge of the stress in your life and enjoy this holiday season! Acupuncture works by decreasing inflammation in localized tissues, releasing endorphins and stimulating myofascial release, which leads to muscle relaxation and stress reduction. If you or someone you are experiencing stress, call our office at (740) 206-8705 and schedule your appointment today! Discover the benefits of acupuncture and begin to de-stress yourself! Gift certificates are also available and make great gifts for those on your list that are hard to shop for. by Michelle Sauberzweig 1.

We spend a lot of time cleaning all the other aspects of our lives, from our homes, to our cars, to our clothes. Why not our bodies? When was the last time, if ever, you cleaned out your elimination system? One of the fastest growing and popular ways to go about detoxification process is by means of acupuncture. The acupuncture process for detoxification is usually done by inserting small needles into certain areas of the ear by trained acupuncturists. The goal is to help speed up the body's ability to get rid of built up toxins. Another treatment modality used in Chinese Medicine is cupping therapy. Cupping stimulates your skin and the underlying muscles while encouraging the discharge of built up toxins in the body. This modality also increases blood circulation and the lymph vessels to those areas. At Living Well Acupuncture, we understand how easy it is fall off the wagon with our diets and how quickly toxins build up. We are here to detoxify you and assist you on your journey to health and wellbeing! Contact us at (740) 206-8705 and schedule your first appointment! by Michelle Sauberzweig What should I expect to happen during an acupuncture session? The first treatment starts with a thorough medical history followed by a physical exam that notes skin tone, tongue condition and the qualities of your wrist pulse. According to TCM theory, these observations provide an indication of what's going on in your body. After making a diagnosis, the practitioner will ask you to lie down and insert needles into key points. You'll be allowed to rest with the needles in place, typically between 20-30 minutes. The patient usually feels so relaxed that they fall asleep while resting. How does acupuncture work? Here is a very brief and simple answer to a very complex (yet simple) form of medicine. Keep in mind, there are dissertations and volumes written about the chemical response at the cellular level and the electromagnetic changes that take place in the body when a needle is inserted. Again, this is intended to be a very simple answer. Thin needles are inserted into the body, which solicits many physiological responses that have proven to be helpful in pain management and promotes the healing process. Needles inserted into specific acupuncture points are known to regulate the nervous, hormonal and immune systems. The needles will also stimulate and promote organ and system functions. This is healing from the inside out. Side note: There are approximately 360 standard acupoints on the body and another 400 extra and ear points. Will it hurt me? Acupuncture should be painless, although some people experience a slight sharp sensation depending on how sensitive they are and where the needles are inserted. Once the needle is in place, it's normal to initially feel a tingling sensation, numbness, mild pressure or warmth for a few seconds before the feeling disappears. After all the needles are inserted, the overwhelming sensation of relaxation takes over and you do not even feel the needles in the body. How big are the needles and how deep are they inserted? Acupuncture needles are as thin (or thinner) than a single human hair. They are solid stainless steel needles, pre-sterilized and disposable. Other metals may be used; however, stainless steel is by far the most widely utilized type. Acupuncture needles are single use needles and are disposed of immediately after a treatment. Acupuncture needles range in size from 40 gauge to 30 gauge needles. There are other sizes available but this range is the most common range utilized. So, based on the information provided above, approximately 40 acupuncture needles (40 gauge) will fit into the tip of an 18-gauge hypodermic needle. This is why acupuncture needles can be inserted into the body and the majority of the time the patient won't even feel the needle. The acupuncturist will insert them to a depth of anywhere from a quarter of an inch to 5 inches, depending on the amount of subcutaneous fat that the needles need to penetrate. What should I do while I'm receiving treatment? Relax. Try to lay still and enjoy some quiet time in your life. Sometimes after the treatment you may feel sleepy or other times very energized. If you have any questions or concerns always ask your practitioner. She is there to help you. Do I have to get naked? No. Most of the time, the main needle-insertion points are on the lower legs, ears or arms, so wearing loose-fitting clothing is fine. Similar to medical doctors, sometimes an acupuncturist will ask you to disrobe and drape with a towel if work on your back, hips, upper legs or torso. How can it help me? Acupuncture is mostly known in the West as a pain relief technique, but is also proven to be useful in numerous other indications. In 1979, the World Health Organization cited 104 conditions that acupuncture can treat \u2014 either alone or in conjunction with contemporary conventional medicine. In 1998 the National Institutes of Health (NIH) issued a Consensus Statement on Acupuncture and cited conditions that acupuncture is effective for. Acupuncture also plays a huge role in preventive care, particularly as a form of stress management. The underlying cause of most of the conditions I treat is chronic stress, which affects multiple systems in the body, including the immune and endocrine systems. NOTE: See the list at the bottom of this article for more specific conditions which acupuncture can effectively treat. Will my insurance cover Acupuncture? Based on your insurance policy, acupuncture may be covered. Please bring your insurance card with you and we would be happy check your insurance benefits for you. What training & education does your licensed acupuncturist have? - Bachelors Degree (BS) in Exercise Science from Nebraska Wesleyan University (2003) - Masters of Science in Traditional Chinese Medicine (MSTCM) from the Colorado School of Traditional Chinese Medicine (April 2009) - Licensed Acupuncturist in the State of Colorado - Licensed Acupuncturist and Diplomat of Oriental Medicine, certified by the NCCAOM (National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine) - Certified in Clean Needle Technique by the AAOM (Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine Commission) - Professional member of the AAC (Acupuncture Association of Colorado) - Served as Treasurer and Board Member of the AAC (Acupuncture Association of Colorado) for 3 years Is it OK for me to eat before or after a session? What about exercise?It's good to eat a little bit before a session because low blood sugar could increase sensitivity to the treatment and cause you to feel faint. Don't, however, eat a heavy meal. For exercise, the reverse holds true. Prior to your session you can exercise as strenuously as you want. However, most acupuncturists advise only mild exercise within several hours after treatment. Eating too much or vigorous exertion can disrupt the corrective flow of energy that follows an acupuncture session. The goal in acupuncture is to shift energy into a new pattern so if you do something really intense you can actually alter the new pattern we are trying to create in your body. How many sessions do I need in order to start feeling the benefits? I wish I could confidently predict that it will take three visits and everyone will be pain free, or allergy free, or pregnant, or whatever the case may be. However, it would be irresponsible for me to predict how many visits it will take for each person to realize their goals. I typically give my patients a range of time based on past experience. Patients with acute conditions usually see some improvement within 4-6 treatments. But that doesn't mean that everyone will see improvement in that amount of time. For a chronic condition (symptomatic experience lasting two years to 10 years plus), it is common for the patient to require more treatments. Some people see improvement faster than others. Each person responds to acupuncture differently. Factors for recovery speed include the patient's stress level (physical, emotional and environmental), amount and quality of rest, diet and exercise. How is Herbal Medicine used? In conjunction with acupuncture treatments, herbs may be prescribed if appropriate to the patient's condition. Unlike conventional pharmaceuticals, Eastern herbs are tailored for the individual's needs, treating the root of the symptoms not only for relief of symptoms. Compared to Western medicine, herbs are much gentler and safer for they are made in nature and most don't cause side effects. Herbal Medicine itself is a powerful method of healing and it can function in a number of different ways such as killing viruses' and bacteria, preventing disease, increasing energy and slowing down the aging process. Herbal Medicine is a gentle but effective way to achieve a complete body recovery. What conditions does Acupuncture treat? The World Health Organization (WHO) and National Institute of Health have recognized over 200 conditions that Traditional Chinese Medicine can effectively treat. Here are just a few: Cancer Musculoskeletal Vomit/Nausea from Chemo drugs Arm / Leg Pain Arthritis Digestive Auto Injury Abdominal Pain Back / Hip Pain Candida Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Colitis Fibromyalgia Constipation Hand / Foot Pain Diabetes Knee Pain Diarrhea Muscle Cramping Indigestion, Gas, Bloating, Belching, GERD Muscle Pain / Sprain / Strain Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) Muscle Weakness / Atrophy Nausea / Vomit Neck / Shoulder Pain Sciatica Gynecological Conditions Tendonitis Endometriosis / Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome Tennis Elbow Infertility Whiplash Menopause Wrist / Ankle Pain Menstrual Irregularities Morning Sickness Neurological Conditions Ovarian Cysts Dizziness PMS Facial Paralysis Headache / Migraine Respiratory Parkinson's Disease Allergies Peripheral Neuropathy Asthma Stroke Bronchitis Trigeminal Neuralgia Common Cold / Flu Cough (Productive or Dry) Other Conditions Hay Fever Addiction (alcohol, drug, nicotine, food) Sinusitis Athletic Performance Enhancement & Recovery Tonsillitis High Cholesterol High Blood Pressure Emotional Weight Loss Anxiety Chronic Fatigue Depression Stop Smoking Insomnia Tinnitus Stress TMJ Palpitations Low Libido Difficulty Breathing Compromised Immune System / Autoimmune disorders Anger Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) by Michelle Sauberzweig What does a Vitamin B12 shots help with? Fatigue Metabolism Memory Focus Mood REM Sleep Immune System How often should I get a Vitamin B shot? The body stores in the liver are refilled with the first half a dozen injections which we recommend being spaced 2-4 weeks apart for the first 12 weeks, then maintenance with monthly to quarterly injections for the life of the patient. Are there any preservatives in the B12 shots that we offer? No, our shots are preservative free. Are there any risks associated with Vitamin B? Vitamin B is usually non-toxic even when taken in large doses What foods do you obtain Vitamin B from? Vitamin B comes from food that comes from animals including eggs, fish, meat, poultry, eggs, milk, milk products and fortified breakfast cereals, fortified soy, fortified energy bars and nutritional yeast. How long have Vitamin B supplements been used? Vitamin B has been supplemented for 50 years. Who are more susceptible to Vitamin B12 deficiency? Elderly, vegans and vegetarians Inadequate dietary intake of vitamin B12 Intrinsic factor deficiency Any structural damage or wide surgical resection of the terminal ileum (the principal site of Vitamin B12 absorption) Achlorydria (including artificially induced by drugs such as proton pump inhibitors) Bacterial overgrowth (such as blind loop syndrome) Patients on diabetes medication, metformin. This drug may interfere with B12 dietary absorption Hereditary causes such as severe MTHFR deficiency, homocystinuria and transcobalamin deficiency Patients with chronic intestinal infestation by the tapeworms, Giardiasis or similar parasites Is it safe for pregnant or breastfeeding women to take Vitamin B? Yes, but I would recommend them to take the oral supplement and not exceed the daily dosage until no long pregnant or breast feeding. At that point they can begin B12 shots. Who should NOT receive a Vitamin B12 shots? Those with Leber's disease (A hereditary disease in which the optic nerve wastes away. Vitamin B12 can actually speed up the atrophy of the optic nerve resulting in rapid loss of central vision. Anyone who has undergone heart surgery and received coronary stents may have an increased risk of the artery narrowing again when they take Vitamin B12 so shots are not recommended for them either. If you are interested in getting a B12 shot, contact Michelle Sauberzwieg, Licensed Acupuncturist at (740) 206-8705. by Michelle Sauberzweig Did you know that Acupuncture is now being used by one third of the world? For the past 3,000 years acupuncture has successfully treated billions of people for many different symptoms, conditions, injuries and diseases. Acupuncture is growing rapidly because many people are tired of 'band aid therapy'. Historically, medicine has always been about treating symptoms and disease. Most of us ignore our bodies until they begin screaming out at us in some sort of pain, numbness, indigestion, insomnia, weakness, fatigue, or any other number of unbearable symptoms. When we can no longer stand it we make an appointment with a physician, take a drug and hope the symptoms magically go away. With the magic comes a plethora of side effects, accompanied by the same underlying problem that is now masked by the drug. Most people are no longer looking for a band-aid to put on their problem, but rather a solution to the cause of their problem. With Acupuncture, the concern is not the symptom or the disease. Instead, we focus on determining the underlying cause of the particular problem and restoring the normal balance within the body which is often the original cause of the exacerbated symptoms. Acupuncture is just one branch of Chinese Medicine that promotes natural healing and restores internal balance. Acupuncture is used to enhance the body's ability to heal itself, alleviate pain, strengthen the immune system and prevent disease.

The United States is the most vaccinated country in the world and spends more money than any other country on healthcare. However, the Unites States ranks 37th out of 191 countries based on public health statistics. Americans are required by law to use more vaccines than any other nation in the world. In no other country - not in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Germany, Japan or in any other country - are citizens subjected to mandatory use of dozens of doses of vaccines under the threat of being denied a public education and health insurance and employment. A World Health Organization report found that disease and mortality rates in third world countries have no direct correlation with immunization procedures or medical treatment. Instead, they are related to an increase in hygiene, sanitation and diet. However, we continue to vaccinate. In fact, if you give your child all the scheduled vaccinations between ages 0-6, your child would receive 38 shots delivering 52 individual doses? If you are an obedient and compliant American who blindly accepts without question the vaccination bill of goods from the government, your lifetime vaccine exposure by your 75th birthday will be 141 shots, delivering 169 doses! For public schools to receive government funding 92% of the students must be vaccinated. Many people are comparing the mandated mass vaccination as state sponsored bioterrorism. Much of this regulation is political. In fact, The National Vaccine Information Center reports that on February 22, 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court shielded drug companies from all liability for harm caused by vaccines mandated by government when companies could have made a safer vaccine. From now on, drug companies selling vaccines in America will not be held accountable by a jury of our peers in a court of law if those vaccines cause brain damage and they could have been made less toxic. This is not public health. It is a drug company stockholder's dream and a health care consumer's worst nightmare. How can you learn more? Please join with the non-profit National Vaccine Information Center, the largest, oldest and most experienced vaccine safety and informed consent watchdog in America. Vaccine laws are state laws. Sign up for our free Advocacy Portal at www.NVICAdvocacy.org that will teach you how to participate effectively in the democratic legislative process and defend vaccine exemptions in your state laws. What the Doctors Say. . . \"Vaccination has been a disaster on the immune system. It actually causes a lot of illnesses. We are actually changing our genetic code through vaccination. 10 years from now we will know that the biggest crime against humanity was vaccines.\" - Guylaine Lanctot, MD in Medical Post If an individual has five consecutive flu shots his/her chance of developing Alzheimer's disease is 10 times greater if they had one, two or no shots. - Hugh Fundenburg, MD, PhD, World's Leading Immunologist The most important thing to do is to focus on the innate immune system which makes up 99% of your immune system as opposed to the adaptive immunity, composed of 1% of antigen specific immune response which the immunizations target. To keep your immune system healthy without the use of vaccines, here are some things you can do: Get regular acupuncture to increase your immune system's own ability to fight common illnesses Practice good hygiene by washing hands Participate in regular exercise Get quality sleep Eat health foods that include fruits, vegetables and lean meats Learn and implement stress coping strategies Get monthly Vitamin B12 shots For more information on how you can use alternative medicine to increase your immunity to disease, please contact Michelle Sauberzweig at Living Well Acupuncture "}
