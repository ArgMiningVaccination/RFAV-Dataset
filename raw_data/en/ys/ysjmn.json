Frontline staff was actively involved in a series of facilitated events to create solutions to root cause issues in the patient identification process. After multiple events, standard workwas created and a four-hour, instructor lead course was developed. The course coversstandardized naming conventions, search guidelines, wrist-banding and verification proce-dures, as well as the FTC Red Flag Rules. Best practices were incorporated to addressprocess issues, such as the implementation of stat registration in the ED. Results Since implementation began in January 2009, Good Samaritan Hospital has seen a 64 per-cent reduction in the percentage of duplicate medical records created per total registrations.The hospital has sustained a defect rate below the baseline for 7 consecutive months. Ilinois Masonic Medical Center has had a 36 percent reduction in the percentage of dupli- cate medical records created per total registrations. The hospital has sustained a defectrate below the baseline for 5 consecutive months. Good Shepherd Hospital has had a 43 percent reduction in the percentage of duplicate medical records created per total registrations.
