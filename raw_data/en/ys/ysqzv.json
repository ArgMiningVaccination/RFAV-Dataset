Andrew Weil, MD, a visionary physician and author, helped establish the field of integrative medicine as a specialty. His ideas about the treatment and care of the whole person integrate scientifically-validated therapies of conventional medicine with select practices derived from areas sometimes considered to be complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). His defining principles of integrative medicine include: - A partnership between the patient and the practitioner - Consideration of all factors that influence health, wellness, disease - including mind, body and spirit - Use of conventional and alternative methods to facilitate the body's innate healing response - Appropriate consideration given to use of less-invasive and less-harmful interventions, when possible, while addressing the whole person in addition to the disease. - The concept that medicine is based on good science, is inquiry-driven and open to critical consideration of new paradigms In addition to scientifically sound treatment concepts, the practitioner of [integrative medicine](https://www.abpsus.org/integrative-medicine-meaning) espouses the broad concepts of health promotion/illness prevention and healthy living. Practitioners also are expected to exemplify these tenets and to remain open to self-exploration and self-development.
