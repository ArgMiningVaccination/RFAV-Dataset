F or the re asons set for th below, petitioners' motion for r eview is de nied. BACKGROUND This case is the sec ond of three test case s hear d by the Off ice of Special Mast ers as part of the Omnibus Autism P roceeding (\"the omnibus procee ding\" ), a global effort to determine the relationship, if any, between the MMR vaccine, vaccines containing thimerosal, and a utism (or autism spe ctrum disorders) . In order1 to addre ss the approximately 5,000 autism claims pending befor e the c ourt, a pa nel of attorneys representing the various petitioners, referred to as the Petitioners' Steering Commi ttee (\" the steer ing c ommitt ee\"), identified three general theories of causation: (1) that vaccines containing thimerosal, when combined with the MMR vaccine, can cause autism; (2) that vaccines containing thimerosal alone can cause autism; and (3) that the MMR vac cine alone c an ca use autism. The stee ring committee then sele cted three test cases that fe ll within t he same general causation theory , namely that vacc ines containing thimerosal ac ting in combination with the MMR vaccine can cause or contribute to the development of autism. These test cases\u2014Cedillo v. S ecret ary, Dep' t of Hea lth & Human Ser vs., No. 98-916V, Hazlehurst v. Secr etary, Dep' t of Hea lth & Human Servs., No. 03- 654V (the instant case), and Sny der v. Sec retary, Dep' t of Hea lth & Human Ser vs., No. 01- 162V\u2014wer e in turn assig ned to three differ ent spec ial masters for resolution. A hearing wa s held in the first case, Cedillo, in June 2007. At the hearing, petitioners presented testimony from s ix ex pert witnesses, including experts in toxicolog y, immunology , molecular biology, virolog y, neurolog y, and gastroenterology. Respondent countered with evidence from n ine expert witnesses, in the subject ar eas a ddresse d by petit ioners a s well as pedia tric psy chiatry and epidemiolog y. By agreement of the pa rties, the re cord in the pr esent c ase inc ludes all of the general causation evidence admitted in the Cedillo and Snyder hearings.2(...continued)2 (related to whether vaccines containing thimerosal in combination with the MMR vaccine could cause autism) and spec ific ca usation evidenc e (regarding whether the administered va ccine s had caused the autistic condition of the child whose particular case was be ing he ard). Hazlehurst, 2009 WL 332306, at *3. Petitioners define regressive autism as a condition characterized by the loss3 of pre viously acquir ed ski lls rathe r than by the fa ilure to deve lop cer tain skills i n the first instance. Whet her regressive autism is a distinct category from c lassic autism is the subject of debate , howeve r, and is the focus of Section III of the d iscussion below. 3The petition in the instant case was filed on March 26, 2003. According to the re cord, William Yates Hazlehurst wa s born on Fe bruary 11, 2000. During the first y ear of his life, Ya tes rec eived the stan dard c hildhood vaccina tions, including up to 11 vaccines possibly containing thimerosal. On February 8, 2001, three days befor e his first birthday , Yates a dditionally received the MMR vac cine. Whil e the r ecord indicates that Yates de veloped nor mally prior to re ceiving the MMR vacc in month foll owing the vac cination, Yate s beca me, in the words of fa mily, \"wild,\" \" very hyperactive,\" a nd \"out of c ontrol.\" B y the summer of 2001, Yates had lost all meaningful speech and had developed an obsession with letters and numbers. Also during this period, Yates began to experience chronic diarrhe a and a bdominal pain. Yates' s developmenta l and gastrointestinal iss ues led petitioners to see k out a number of trea tments over the ne xt severa l years. In July 2002, afte r a se ries of evalua tions for deve lopmental and speech de lays, Yates wa s diag nosed as demonstrating a sig nificant number of beha viors consistent with autism. Two months later, in September 2002, Y ates be gan tre atment wit h Dr. Jean-Ronel Corbier, a pediatric neuro logist, for that condition. Over the next se veral months, Yates a dditionally underw ent an imm unologic al evaluation and a colonoscopy . The results of both tests were normal. In June 2007, petitioners f iled an ame nded petition with this court alleg ing that Yates's MMR vaccination, or a combination of the MMR vaccination and the vaccines containing thimerosal that Yates had received during his first 12 months, cause d him to develop r egressive a utism. The spec ial master summarized3 petitioners' theory as follows: [P]etitioners assert that the measle s component of the MMR vac cine causes an immune dysfunction that impairs the vaccinee's ability to clear the measles virus. Unable to pr operly clea r the mea sles virus Dr. Corbier additionally noted that the presence of imm unologic problems4 in such children stre ngthens the ca se for MMR -vaccine c ausation but is not an essential par t of the clinica l profile. Ha zlehurst Tr. at 314A. In their post-hearing brief, petitioners explained that although their claim5 (continued...) 4from the bo dy, the vac cinee experience s measles virus pe rsistence which lea ds to chronic infla mmati on in the g astrointestinal sy stem and, in turn, chr onic inflammation in the brain. Petit ioners ar gue that the inflammation in the brain c auses ne urolog ical damag e that manifests as a utism. Hazlehurst v. Secretary, Dep't of Health & Human Servs., 03-654V, 2009 WL 332306, at *86 (F ed. Cl. Fe b. 12, 2009). The spec ial master c onvened a hearing in this case in October 2007. As noted above, both pa rties re lied in part on the general causa tion e vidence prese the pediatric neur ologist, and r espondent off ered testimony of Dr. Thomas T. MacD onald (a gastrointestinal immunologist), Dr. Christ ine McCusker (a pe diatric immunologist), a nd Dr. R ust (a pedia tric neur ologist). During the hea ring, Dr. Corbier testified that differ ences in the timing of the first appe arance of the sy mptoms associated with autism sugg est that there are differ ences in the under lying causes of a utism. The ear lier the onset of the symptoms, Dr. Corbier opined, the more likely that the ca use of the a utism i s genetic, prenat al, or metabolic. I n the ca se of r egressive a utism, however, Dr . Corbier testified that the ca usal are \"ver y likely [to be] ge factors.\" Ha zlehurst Tr. at 270A. Dr. Corbier went on to note that studies have implicated the MMR vacc ine as an e nvironmental fa ctor that c an contr ibute to the deve lopment of reg ressive autism in children who fit within a par ticular c linical profile. Tha t profile, ac cording to Dr. Corbier, c onsists of children who de receiving MMR symptoms of reg ressive a utism wit hin one to nine months following the r eceipt of the MMR va ccine , and experienc ed gastrointestinal problems. Consist ent with this profile, Dr. Corbier observe d that Yates ha d4 develope d normally befor e his MMR vaccination, regresse d within se veral months after the receipt of the MMR vaccine, and suffered from lymphonodular hyperplasia colitis (inflamation of the g ut). Hazlehurst Tr. a t 302A. Dr. Corbier there fore conclude d that Yates' s receipt of the MMR vaccine pl ayed a signific ant role in the development of Yates' s reg ressive a utism. Hazl ehurst Tr. a t 302A-303. 5(...continued)5 had originally been designated by the steering committee as a test case for Theory I\u2014 identify ing the combination of the MMR vacc ine and va ccine s containing thimerosal as a cause of autism\u2014 it became clear at the hearing that a much stronger case could be made linking Ya tes's condition sol ely to the MMR vaccine . Petitioners thus focuse d exclusively on MMR c ausation in ma king their case. As a re sult, the special master limited her specific causation discussion to the causal connection, if any, between the MMR vaccine and the development of Yates's regressive autism. In order fully to ad dress the steer ing committ ee's general causation theory , howeve ster never theless lyzed the evidenc e relating to the pote ntial contribution of thimerosal as a cause of autism spectrum d isorders. As evidenc e that the mea sles virus can pe rsist in the biologica l material of6 autistic children, pe titioners relied primar ily on th e following article s: H. Kawa shima, et al., De tection and Seque of Mea sles Cells From Pati ents With I nflamma tory Bowel Disease and Autism, Dig. Dis. Sci. 45(4): 723-29 (Apr . 2000) (c o-authore d by Dr. Wakef ield); V. Uhlmann, et al., Potential Vira l Pathoge nic Mec hanism for Ne w Var iant Inflammatory Bow el Disease, Mol. Pathol. 55(2): tion of Measles V irus Suppl. 2: (2002) ( co-authored by Drs. Uhlmann, O' Leary, and S heils). In addition, petitioners cited the pr eliminary results of the Walker group purporting to find the existence of the measle s virus in the bowel biopsies of aut istic children. S.J . Walker, et a l., Persistent Ileal Measles Virus in a Large Cohort of Regressive Autistic Children With Ileocolitis and Lymphonodular Hyperplasia: Revisitation of an Earlier Study, poster pre sentation at the I nterna tional Meeting For Autism Researc hers ( IMFAR), University of California, D avis (June 2006). 5Central to Dr. Corbie r's theory were seve ral studies purpor ting to find the prese nce of the measle s virus in the bi ologic al material of autistic childre n who had received the MMR vac cine. The se studies ca me from pr imarily two source s: the work of D r. Andre w Wakefie ld of the Roy al Free Hospital in London, Eng land, and his colleagues Drs. Joh n O'Leary and Orla Sheils at the Unigenetics laboratory in Dublin, I reland; a nd the research of Dr. Stephen Walker and his collea gues at Wake Forest University School of Medicine in Winston-Salem , North Carolina (\" the Walker group\"). According to the special master, Dr. Wakefield was the principle6 proponent of the hypothesis that the rec eipt of the MMR vacc ine re sults in t he development of autism spe ctrum d isorders and gastrointestinal problems in certain children. Dr. Wak efield's work, the special master explained, helped to precipitate litigation in the United King dom examini ng the ca usal conne ction, if a utism (\"the UK litiga tion\"). I n order to support the UK PCR testing is a standard technique f or dete cting and identify ing pa rticular7 gene se quence s in tiss ue samples by exponentially replica ting nds of DNA. Hazlehurst, 2009 WL 332306, at *95. The methods used by Unig enetics f ormed the basis for the research in the8 2002 Uhlmann ar ticle, one of the ar ticles on which petiti oners pr imarily relied.

Y ates, by contra st, underwe nt no such testing. Dr. Wakef ield published an ar ticle i n 1993 positing a c ausal c onnection9 between the measles virus and infarctions of sma ll blood vessels in the gut wall leading to C rohn's disease. A.J . Wakefield, e t al., Evidence of Persistent Mea sles Infection in C rohn's Disea se, J. M ed. Virol. 39(4): 345-53 (Apr. 1993). The spe cial master noted that in response to the public \"furor \" created by the 1993 Wak efield article , the Medical Research Council of the United K ingdom r eviewe d Dr. Wak efield's work and concluded that Dr. Wak efield ha d performed his experiments with rea gents that wer e not spec ific for the mea sles virus and without important controls that the manufacturer of the testing equipment recomm ended. Hazlehurst, 2009 WL 332306, at *87. The specia l master additionally observe d that following a series of methodologically sound studies conducted in the late 1990s, the scientific comm unity ultimately dismissed Dr. Wak efield's hypothesis as having little scientific merit. I d. Dr. Wa kefield published two additional articles in 1998 and 2000, the first advancing the hypothesis that the MMR vaccine leads to the development of autism spectrum disorde rs with gastrointestinal manifestations and the sec ond repor ting the finding of ente rocolitis in children with deve lopmental disorders. Non-Spec ific Colitis in Children, Lancet 351(9103): 637-41 (Feb. 1998); A.J. Wakefield, et al., Enterocolitis in Children With Developmental Disorders, Am. J. (continued...) 6litigation, Drs. O' Leary and S heils of Trinity College in Dublin formed the Unig enetics la boratory , a non-ac credited, for- profit institut ion that used a tec hnique called PCR (poly mera se cha in rea ction) to test for the presenc e of the measles virus in biopsied tiss ue. The positive findi ngs reported by the Unig enetics la boratory78 were later the focus of the Wal ker group, whose preliminary testing purported to replica te Unig enetics' results. The special m aster observed, however , that Dr. Wakef ield's work ha s been wide ly discredited by the scientific community, and that the testing conducted at9(...continued)9 Gastroe nterolog y 95(9): 2285-95 (2000) . Both a rticles we re the subject of e xtensive criticism, however, and the special master ultimately found them to be \"scientifically unreliable.\" Hazlehurst, 2009 WL 332306, at *90. In addition, the special master observe d that ten of Dr . Wakefield's 12 c o-authors on the 1998 article later r etracted the study 's conclusion that a potential causa l link exists between the MMR vacc ine and autism. I d. at *90-92. 7both the Unig enetics a nd Wake Forest labora tories contained pr ocedur al flaw s that compromised t heir reliability . The spec ial master thus found that the studies on which Dr . Corbier re lied wer e \"sc ientifically liable\" re aspec t of petit ioners' causation theory (positing the existence of per sisting measle s virus in the g ut tissue of autistic children) \" could not be credited as sound or reliable.\" Hazlehurst, 2009 W L 332306, at *13. The master a ccordingly conclude d that petitioners' theor y of ca usation was \" premised upon a series of biological implausabilities\" and was \"at variance with the known scienc e.\" Id. at *148-49. Following the issuance of the spec ial master' s decision deny ing compensation, p etitioners now ask the court to a ddress three issues on appeal. Specifica lly, petitioners object the tory that detec ted the mea sles virus in the tissue of autistic childre n; (2) the spe cial master 's fa ilure to consider evidenc e demonstrating the re liability of re sults obtained by the W alker group, also purpor ting to find the prese nce of the measle s virus in the tissue of autistic children; a nd (3) the specia l master's f ailure to decide whether r egressive a utism i s a distinct phenoty pe from cla ssic autism. W e addr ess these issues in turn be low. DISCUS SION When de ciding a motion for revie w of a specia l master's de cision under the Vaccine Act, the court may: (A) uphold the f indings of f act and conclusions of law of the specia l master and sustain the spe cial master 's dec ision, (B) set aside any finding s of fa ct or c onclusion of law of the special master found to be ar bitrary , capr icious, an abuse of discretion, or othe rwise not in accorda nce with law and issue its own finding s of fa ct and c onclusions of law, or (C) remand t he petiti on to the specia l master for further action Even if pe titioners are succe ssful for10 causa tion, the special master may never theless deny compensation where the respondent has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the injury is due to (continued...) 8in acc ordanc e with 300a a- 12(e) (2)(B) forth three distinct standards of r eview: ( 1) the spec ial master' s finding s of fa ct are to be r eviewe d under the arbitra ry and master's discr etionary ruling s are to be re viewed unde r the a buse of discr etion standard; conc lusions are to be r eviewe d de novo under the not in accordance with law standard. Turner v. Secretary, Dep't of Health & Human Se rvs., 268 F.3d 1334, 1337 (F ed. Cir. 2001). Re versible error is extreme ly difficult to establish, however, so long as the special master has \"con sidered the relevant evidence in t he record as a whole, drawn plausible inferences from th at evidence, and articulated a basis for [the] decision which is rational.\" Hines v. Secre tary, Dep' t of Health & Human Ser vs., 940 F.2d 1518, 1527 (Fed. Cir. 1991). There are two methods for establishing entitlement to compensation under the Vaccine Ac t. If the va ccine e suff ered one of the injuries identified in the V accine Injury Table w ithin the prescr ibed time period (42 U .S.C. ) (initial Table) and 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.3 (updated Table)), a petitioner may assert what is commonly referred to as a \"Table injury,\" with a rebuttable presumption that the injury was c aused by Human Servs., 451 F .3d 1352, 1355 (F ed. Cir. 2006). If the va ccine e suff ered an injury not ide ntified in the Vaccine Injury Table, how ever (as in the pr esent c ase), no such presumption exists and a petitioner must show that the vaccine \"caused\" or \"significantly aggravated\" the injury in question (comm only referred to as a c ausation-in-f In order to demonstrate that Ya tes's injury was c aused in fa ct by the challen ged vaccine, petitioners must prove their claim by a preponderance of the evidence, a standard that is satisfied by showing that it is \"more probable than not\" that the vaccine a t issue cause d the vac cinee 's injury . Althen v. Secr Servs., 418 F.3d 1274, 1279 (Fed. Cir. 2005). To case for causa tion under Althen, : \"(1) a medical theor y causally connecting the vaccination and the injury; (2) a logical sequence of cause and ef fect showing tha t the vacc ination was t he reason for the injury ; and (3) a showing of a proxi mate temporal relationship betwe en vaccination a nd injury .\" Id. at 1278.

In the instant suit, petitioners assert that the measles component of the MMR vaccine can cause an im mune dysfunction in certain children that impedes their systems from clea ring the measle s virus. According to this hy pothesis, the persisting measles virus lea ds to chronic infla mmation in both the gastrointestinal sy stem and the bra in. The inflammation in the bra in, petitioners maintain, cause s neurolog ical damage that manifests as autism. In analy zing petitioners' me dical theor y unde r the Althen standard, the spec ial master identifie d two car dinal flaws in petiti oners' case . First, the spe cial master explained that petitioners' e xperts base d their opinions on the char acteristics of the \"wild-type\" measles virus rather than on the characteristics of vaccine-strain measles, despite the fa ct that the mea sles vacc ine i s distinguishable f rom the wild-ty pe measles viru s in several key respects. Second, the special master observed that11 petitioners' e xperts further based their opinions on studies ( detec ting the pre sence of the measles virus in the gut tissue of autistic children) that the spec ial master f ound to be unre liable. As a res ult of these de ficienc ies, the spec ial master he ld that The special master additionally held that petitioners had failed to establish12 a temporal association under the third prong of Althen because the vacci ne-strain measles virus doe s not replicate well in the human body and the only evidenc e petitioners offe red for mea sles persistenc a rticle\u2014wa s discredited. Id. at *150. 10petitioners had failed to satisfy the first two prongs of the Althen standard because their medica l theory was pre mised upon a ser ies of biologica l implausibi lities and the prese nted evidenc e did not support a log ical seque nce of cause and e ffect betwe 2009 *149-50.12 In rea ching her c onclusion, the specia l master desc ribed the finding of persistent mea sles virus in the g ut tissue of autistic children a s the \"linchpin\" of petitioners' theor y. Id. at *171. The spe cial mast er went on to describe that proposition, however , as \"g laring ly unreliable \" base d on her assessment that the studies on which petitioners' e xperts based their conc lusions untenable.\" Id. In particula r, the specia l master devote d extensive discussion to an analysis of the testing methods of the Unigenetics laboratory, explaining that petitioners' re liance on those test results, coupled with re spondent's criticism of them, m ade it necessary for her to a nalyze Unigenetics' practices \"with more scrutiny than generally occurs in vaccine proceedings.\" Id. at *126. It is this scrutiny that serve s as the first g round for petitioners' a ppeal. I. The Special Master's Reliance on Evidence That Should Not Have B een Consider ed The spec ial master ba sed her assessment re garding the re liability of the testing c onducted a t Unige netics in part on the testimony of Dr. Stephe n A. B ustin, a molecula r biologist who a ppear ed as a n expert witness both for the va ccine manufacturers in the UK litigation and for respondent in the om nibus proceeding. As part of the UK litiga tion, Dr. Busti n was c harged with eva luating the 2002 Uhlmann ar ticle and examining the testing me thods used by the Unig enetics labora tory. Dr. Bustin later testified that he spent 1,500 hours ana lyzing data f rom the laboratory, including two site visits, and billed approxima tely $400,000 for his efforts. Based on his of Unig enetics' proce dures, equipment, and labora tory notebooks, Dr. B ustin concluded that the U nigenetics re searchers had failed to follow the laboratory's own standard operating procedures, failed to adhere to certain standard la boratory prac tices, and failed to comply with the standards se t forth by the manufa cture r of the testing equipment, all of whic h diminis hed the r eliability of the test results purporting to show the prese nce of the m easle s virus in the g ut tissue of autistic children. Dr . Bustin spec ulated that the Unig enetics r esearchers had de tected Prior to their admission in the Cedillo case, Dr. Bustin's reports, like all13 of the exhibits in the UK litiga tion, had been unde r sea l by the B ritish court. Dr. Bustin additionally had bee n the subj ect of a court order prohibiting him from testify ing about Unigene tics' procedures, equipment, and laboratory notebooks in any other c ase. B oth Dr. B ustin's repor ts and his testimony wer e made available , however, following the respondent's successful application to the British court. The special m aster expl ained that the steering c ommitt ee ha d informed the14 specia l masters hea ring the three test case s of its decision not to seek the re lease of additional documents from the British court because its efforts to do so like ly would have been unsuccessful given the steering comm ittee's inability to get the requisite consent from the experts whose re ports they soug ht.

Dr. Bustin was subsequently identified as an expert in the Cedillo case in late May/early June 2007 in support of a motion in limine by the respondent unrelated to the testimony presently at issue. On June 7, 2007, two business days befor e the commenceme nt of the hea ring in Cedillo, t he re spondent soug ht to introduce two expert reports by Dr. Bustin obtained from the UK litigation (Cedillo Resp. Exs. WW and XX), along with Dr. Bustin's testimony regarding his evaluation of Unigenetics' proce dures, e quipment, and l aboratory notebooks. The pe titioners objected to the last-minute filings and disclosure, but the exhibi ts wer e never theless provisionally admitted i nto evidenc e on June 8, 2007. (The pre siding spec ial master de ferred ruling on whether he would re ly on the re ports, but a llowed either party to question Dr. Bustin.) By order dated J une 11, 2007, howeve r, the special masters a ssigne d to the three test cases advised that they would \"favorably consider joining in a request for release of r elevant r eports\" if the steer ing c ommitt ee filed a for mal application with the British court.13 Dr. B ustin was the subject of a simil ar challeng e in the pre sent ca se. I n a motion filed on September 4, 2007, pe titioners objected to the a dmission of Dr. Bustin's re ports reg arding Unig enetics unde r the theor y that consi deration of that evidenc e in the absenc e of the other expert repor ts prepared in the UK litigation would be prejudicial. In addre ssing pe titioners' motion, the special master noted that petitione rs had bee n aff orded a \"generous\" per iod of time to obtain the relea se of additional expert reports from the British court but ha d declined to do so.

I d. at *8-9. Petitioners now argue, however, that the special master's consideration of Dr. Bustin's testimony and reports was fun damentally unfair and was inconsistent with the purpose a nd nature of the Va ccine Prog ram in violation of both the Vac cine Rules and the r eleva nt case law. Specif ically, petitioners maintain that the spec ial15 master' s Dr. the Vac cine Rules' r equire ment that the consideration of evidence in the Vac cine Prog ram be \"governe d by principles of funda mental fa irness to both parties.\" Vaccine Rule 8(b)( 1). The admission of16 Dr. B ustin 's testimony and re ports was funda mentally unfair, pe titioners arg ue, because the material was submi tted a mere t wo working days befor e the be ginning of the Cedillo hearing, severely imp airing the ability of the Cedillos' attorney to mount an effective c ross-exami nation of Dr. Bustin or to p repare an adequate response to his analysis. Further compounding this inequity, in petitioners' view, is the fa ct that petitioners could not have counter ed Dr . Bustin's ana lysis without spending large sums of money , something the y were unable \u2014and should not in the spirit of the Vaccine Prog ram have been require d\u2014to do. Finally, petitioners maintain that even if they had re ceive d adequa te notice of Dr. B ustin's analy sis and had sufficient funds to a ddress it, they neverth eless woul d have been unable to counter Dr. Bustin's testimony because the Unigenetics laboratory no longer exists and Unig enetics' equipment and labor atory notebooks ar e no long er available f or revie w. Such prejudice , petitioners maintain, can only be re medied by excluding Dr . Bustin's testimony and reports. In addition, petitioners contend that the admission of Dr. B ustin's testimony and reports conver ted the proc eeding Knudse n v. Secretary , Dep' t of Hea lth & Human Ser vs., 35 F.3d 543, 549 (F ed. Cir. 1994) (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 99-908, a t 3 (1986), as r eprint ed in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N.136344). P etitioners assert that admitting evidence inconsistent with the purpose and nature of the Va ccine Prog ram is an e rror of law and thus urge the c ourt to review the special master's reliance on such evidence de novo under the not in accordance with law standa rd. In respondent's view, petitioners cannot co ntend that Unigenetics' testing is critical to their case and yet object when respondent offers evidence to challenge its reliability. Respondent argues that Dr. Bustin's reports are reliable evidence that is direc tly applicable to the issues in this l itigation and a re thus vital to assessing the correctne ss of petitioners' theor y of causation. I n addition, respondent maintains that the subject of Dr. Bustin's repor ts should have come as no surprise to petitioners because several of petitioners' expert witnesses had direct knowledge of the problems with Unige netics' testing methods identified by Dr. B ustin. I ndeed, r espondent points out that four of petitioners' ex perts in the omnibus procee ding a lso served a s expert witnesses in the UK litigation, and pe titioners' expert Dr. Ronald Ke nnedy specifically testified about the Unigenetics laboratory during the Cedillo hearing. Finally , responde nt endorses the specia l master's conclusion set for th in her denia l of petitioners' motion to strike: \"[F]airness to the par ties has bee n achie ved by affording releva nt information for c onsideration in dec iding this ca se.\" H azlehurst, 2009 WL 332258, at *8. Vaccine )(1) indeed r equire s that proce eding s within the Vacc ine Prog ram be conduc ted in a manner that is fundamentally fair. A nd petitioners ar e correct that the program does not anticipate or encourage complex litigation. See Andre u, 2009 WL 1688231, at *4 ( recognizing that Cong ress, in ena cting the Vaccine Ac t, was \"acutely awa re tha t the traditional tort sy stem had prove n ineffe ctive in providing redress for va ccine -injured individuals 'bec ause it re sulted in lengthy delay s, high tra nsaction costs, and sometimes no re cover y,'\" quoting Lowry v. Secre tary, Dep' t Human Servs., 189 F.3d 1378, 1381 ( Fed. Cir. 1999)). We do not believe, how ever, that the special mas ter violated either principle in the instant case. It is evident, as an initial matter, that petitioners were given adequate time to addre ss Dr. B ustin's analy sis. Although petitioners were notified of the submissi on of Dr. B ustin's reports a me re two business da ys before the Cedillo hea ring, the specia l masters neve rtheless made ever y effort to acc ommodate petiti oners a nd reme dy any element of surprise by leaving the re cord ope n for more than a y ear following the Cedillo hearing to allow petitioners to rec all witnesses (including Dr. Bustin) or to pr ovide additional evidenc e. The specia l masters additionally offered to lend their name s to a reque st for re levant re ports filed in the UK litig ation. Hazlehurst, 200 9 WL 332306, at *93 . Given the se circumstances, we are unable to conclude that petitioners were unfairly prejudice d as a result of the timing of the Indeed, g iven the fa ct that re spondent neither c ommissi oned nor pa id for17 the re ports, it is di fficult to distinguish them conc eptually from any information existing in the public domain. 14submissi on of Dr. B ustin's reports. Nor do we believe tha t the specia l master's c onsideration of D r. Bustin's analy sis transformed the proce eding into complex tort litigation. Althoug h Dr. Bustin's re ports wer e created in connec tion with the UK litigation and funded by the vaccine manufa cture rs, the re levant conside ration is not the cost of Dr . Bustin's reports but rather their purpose: to rebut critical evidence introduced by petitioners.17 Petitioners themselves acknowledge that Unigenetics' results are central to their claim. Dr. Bustin's testimony speaks directly to whether that evidence has any merit. The proposition that \"funda mental fa irness\" r equire s the specia l master to ig nore evidence so crucial to the case\u2014in effect to contend that respondent has no right to mount a defense\u2014is untenable. Indeed, a specia l master's r efusa l to consider such \"highly relevant and probative evidence \" has been found to be an a buse of discr etion. DeFazio v . Secretary, Dep' t of Hea lth & Human Ser vs., 40 Fe d. Cl. 462, 467 n.5 (1998). As the spec ial master c orrectly noted in her de cisio n, petitioners had no obliga tion to subm it medical studies in support of their claim. But once petitioners had done so, the special master was duty-bound to assess the reliability of those studies. Hazlehurst, 2009 WL 332306, at *17 (citing Daube rt v. Merr ell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 590 (1993)); see also Campbell ex rel. Campbell v. Secre tary, Dep' t of Health & Human Servs., 69 Fed. Cl. 7 75, 781 (2006) (interpreting the relevant case law as requiring a special master \"to rely on reliable medical or scientific e vidence not only in finding c ausation, but also the lac k there of\"). The only difficulty we have then with Dr. Bust in's analysis is t hat it essentially goes unanswered in petitioners' case. Despite the special masters' best efforts to acc ommodate petitioners, the unf ortunate f act remains t hat Dr. B ustin's testimony and repor ts reflect 1,500 hours of c ritical eva luation that petitioners have no way to replicate . Whil e petitioners' experts D r. Karin H epner (a molecula r biologist) and D r. Ronald Kenne dy (a pr ofessor a nd the cha ir of the De partment of Microbiolog y and I mmunology at Texas Tec h University Health Sciences Center ) each filed supplemental r eports addr essing Dr. B analy ty of Unig enetics' testing, Cedillo Pet. Ex s. 120 and 121, neith er expert had the opportunity to r eview the primary materials on which Dr. Bustin based his conclusions. The closest either expert actually came to the Unigenetics laboratory, in fac t, was Dr. K ennedy 's par ticipation in a mee ting in which he and seve ral Dr. Kennedy described the meeting with Dr. Sheils as follows: 18 [O]ver four-a nd-a- half to s, [Dr. Sheils] a sked a numbe r of questions rela tive to the t echnology, the standar d opera ting proce dures, th e immunohistochemistry that was shown, how she detec ted what were her primers, wha t were the sensitivity , how was isolation done, what we re controls, what were positive controls, how did she know that this wa s not co ntamination, what was the samples. She was e ssentially taken a part by , I would say , three or four extremely good microbiolog ists. Cedillo Tr. at 811A. 15colleagues questioned Dr. Unigenetics' research practices. We do n ot,18 howeve r, consider Dr. Ke nnedy 's testimony a leg itimate counterwei ght to Dr. Bustin's testimo ny regarding Unigenetics' procedures because the former spent a mere five hours inte rviewing Dr. She ils while the latter spe nt 1,5 00 hours with full access to Unig enetics' facilities and r ecords. Their e xperie nces are simply not compar able. Dr. Kennedy's supplemental report illustrates the significance of this imbalance . Addre ssing tory, Dr. Kennedy opined as follows: Wha t becomes clear in a review of [Dr. Bustin's] testimony and his PowerPoint presentation is that while he readily identifies problems, he omits any explanatory references which wou ld pla ce the issue into context. By selec tively highlig hting only a fe w pag es which he claims supports his criticism that the [Unigenet ics] labora tory was less than di ligent, it is unknown whethe r these la boratory notebooks also contain infor mation which demonst rates that the labora tory took the appr opriate a ction to resolve une xpecte d issues. The lac k of access to the laboratory notebooks will, of course, affec t my comments. Cedillo P et. Ex. 121 at 2. Addressing Dr. B ustin's specif ic criticisms of the contamination issue, Dr. Kennedy additionally observed as follows: It is easy to rectify contamination of negative controls and does not invalidate positive results by any laboratory that is competent in PCR technologies. Whil e Dr. Bustin identified the contamination problem, he attempted to use this one page to imply that contamination issues were neve r resolved, y et his PowerPoint prese ntation did not include During oral argument, petitioners' counsel raised the issue whether his19 clients should be bound by proce dural decisions made by the steer ing c ommitt ee or by the counsel in Cedillo (i.e., the decision not to seek expert reports from the British court). Petitioners themselves, howe ver, c ould have soug ht evidence filed in the UK litigation, particularly when it became clear at the Cedillo hearing that the reliability of the Unig enetics r esults would be an issue in dispute. 16any further support that contamination w as an unre medied proble m in the [Unigenetics] labora tory. He did not include a ny additional pages fr om the labora tory notebooks that indicate c ontamination issues were perva sive and unre solved. Since contamination is an eve r present problem in laboratories, an isolated day of problems should not be used to impug n a re putation developed ove r a li fe time of achievement. Cedillo P et. Ex. 121 at 3 (citation omitt ed). D r. Ke nnedy offe red similar observa tions reg arding D r. Bustin's other cr iticisms, describing ma ny of them as irrele vant or unve rifiable without having access to the labora tory notebooks upon which Dr . Bustin relied. As Dr. Kennedy noted, \"a n isolated pag e from a labora tory notebook does not provide a ny context for the co nditions associated with [a] particula r experiment.\" Cedillo Pet. Ex . 121 at 3. Given that the special master's critique of Unigenetics' practices reflects a greater level of scrutiny than generally occurs in vaccine proceedings, Hazlehurst, 2009 WL 332306, at *126, we f ind this sparity of ac cess to Unigene tics' fa cilities and laboratory notebooks troubling. Few institutions, we suspect, can entirely withstand the level of sc rutiny provi ded by Dr. B ustin, particularly without explicative or re habilitative testimony . And we a cknowledg e, as D r. Ke nnedy charges, that Dr. B ustin's criticisms may be take n out of context. But while we are sympathetic to petitioners' concerns on this score, it would be an e xtraordina ry reme dy to exclude such r eleva nt and proba tive evidenc e. The only solution, we believe, is the on e the special master employ ed: mitigating any potential prejudice by affording petitioners the opportunity to seek relevant reports from the UK litigation and to re call Dr . Bustin for f urther questioning. The fa ct that petitioners did neither considerably weakens their position. See Snyder v. Secretary, Dep't of He alth & Human Servs., No. 01-162V, 2009 WL 332044, at *27 (Fed. Cl. Feb. 12, 2009) (holding that petitioners waived any argument regarding the reports filed in the UK litig ation beca use of their failure to seek their r elease). 19 Most significa nt for the pur poses of our a nalysis, however , is the fac t that we believe that the spec ial master would ha ve re ached the same c onclusion reg arding Unig enetics e ven in the abse nce of Dr. B ustin's analy sis. As the special maste r In particula r, the spec ial master identifie d the testimony of re spondent's20 experts Dr. B rian J . Ward (an inf ectious disease specia list), Dr. Diane Griff in (an immunologist), and Dr. Bertus Rima (a virolog ist) as \"the most per suasive on the subject of va ccine at *7, and r elied upon the testimony of those same experts in her discussion of the Unig enetics la boratory , id. at *128-32.

According to Dr. He pner, a lthough other studies\u2014most not ably by A fzal and Ya smin D'Souz a\u2014had23 attempted to replicate the U hlmann results, the Walker g roup investig ators we re the first to do so succe ssfully , in part bec ause of their use of gut tissue.

Acc ording ly, responde nt cont ends that the Walker g roup's27(...continued)27 sample must be positive ever y time the experiment is run. I f the positive control is negative, ther e is a fla w in the experimental desig n, and no information can be obtained. A n egative control . . . is a sample in which measles virus is not present. The sample must be negative every time the experiment is run. If the negative control is positive, there is either a flaw in the experimental design (such as a primer that is not sufficiently specific to the desired target) or cross- contamination betw een the negative control and the measles virus. The ne gative samples within the experiment function as a c ontrol for contamination. . . . [W]hen the controls do not function true to designation, confidence in the results obtained from the experiments diminis hes. Hazlehurst, 2009 WL 332306, at *120 (c itation s omitted). The spe cial master additionally described the need for experimental and control samples as follows: The second level of control includes experimental subjects and the nor mal controls. . . . By desig n, the control g roup has to be simil ar to the experimental group but has to differ by the var iable of interest. In running an experiment, the investigator must run all four controls (the positive, neg ative, experimental a nd control samples) a t the same time. The controls mus t be run every time an experiment is conducte d. That is standard la boratory prac tice. Id. (citations omitted). A blinded ex periment is one in which the rese archer doe s not know28 whether he is w orking with a positive control, a negative control, or th e sample in question so as to avoid introducing the re searcher's subjectivity into the analy sis. Respondent, we believe, overreads Dr. Hepner's testimony on these points.29 (continued...) 20results are not reliable be cause there is no internal consistency in the study and the positive findings could very likely be due to contamination. Respondent additionally notes that Dr. He pner he rself a cknowledg ed that the pre liminary data f rom the study was \" not useful at this tim e\" (Cedillo Tr. at 682), dec lined to draw a ny conclusions about the biolog ical signific ance of the Walker group's finding s (Cedillo T r. at 682), and identified w hat re spondent describes as seve ral sig nificant dra wbac ks to the study , including that the experiments ha d not be en \"blinded\" and had l acked28 negative contr ols (Cedillo Tr . at 658, 681). Respondent thus arg ues that the spec ial29(...continued)29 Dr. He pner e xplained that the Walker group's da ta was \" not useful at this time\" because the re sults for the experimental g roup (i.e., c hildren with autism) had not been compared to a control group (i.e., children without autism), so no biological conclusions could be dr awn r egarding the conne ction betwee n the measle s virus and autism. Cedillo Tr. at 657-58. Dr. Hepne r repeatedly maintained, howeve r, that the Walker g roup re sults were r eleva nt to the om nibus proce eding beca use they showed primer-set specificity, thereby helping to v alidate the Uhlmann article's results detec ting mea sles persistenc e in the g ut tissue of autistic c hildren. Cedillo Tr. larly, while Dr. H epner acknow ledged that the Walker study was not blinded, she testified that \"there would be no point in being blinded because there [were] only experimental samples.\" Cedillo Tr. at 681. Finally, Dr. Hepner expl ained that while the Walker group had not y et found control samples they deeme d suitable (i.e., developmentally normal children with gastrointestinal issues), they had nevertheless run no-template controls in ever y experiment to ensure a gainst contamination. Cedillo Tr. at 658, 662A. 21master c orrectly deter mined that the Walker group's preliminary , unpublished, and unconfirme d finding s do not support the validity of the Unig enetics te st results. Although the specia l master re cognized sequencing as the \" gold standard\" for deter mining the r eliability of PCR , Hazlehu rst, 2009 WL 332306, at *116, she no mention of the Walker g roup's seque ncing in her de cision. The spec ial master r elied instead on the te stimony of Dr. B ustin, who ex plained that in the absenc e of both positive and negative controls, he could not have \"a ny confide nce\" in the test results prese nted by the Walker g roup. Cedillo T r. at 1959A. The spe cial master thus dismissed the Walker g roup's finding s as pre liminary and conc luded could not \"pla ce h ht\" on such finding s because \"test re sults without the use of these controls during PCR experiments may not be re liable.\" Ha zlehurst, 2009 WL 332306, at *125. There is evidence in the rec ord, howe ver, that Dr. Bustin was not awa re tha t the Walker group had seq uenced the ir results. Seemingly without regard to this fact, Dr. Bustin expressed concern about sever al uni dentified ba nds in the Walker g roup's poster pre sentation, explaining that he c ould not rule out the possibili ty of contamination in the absence of negative controls. Cedillo Tr. at 1959A. Dr. Bustin went on to testify that in order to a ddress th e possibili ty of conta mination, \"do a dditional techn iques to confir m the identity of that band,\" noting that the \"best way\" to confirm that the band is the target \"is sequencing, is getting a DNA se quence .\" Cedillo Tr. at 1942A. Dr. B ustin unfortunately was ne ver c ross-examined on this point so we ha ve no way of knowing what conc lusions he would ha ve draw n from the Walker group's We are unable to assess with any confide nce either the le gitimacy of Dr.30 Bustin's criticism of the Walker group's procedures or the correctness of petitioners' response to that criticism. Dr. B ustin testified that he had no f aith in the results of the Walker g roup's study beca use of the a bsence of negative controls. Cedillo Tr. at 1959A. Petitioners' counse l contended at oral argument, howeve r, that despite Dr. Bustin's criticism, the Wal ker group in fact used negative internal controls in their experiments a nd Dr. Hepner testified that a no-template control, designed to \"func tion[ ] as a control for contamination,\" wa s run with e very sample. Cedillo Tr. at 658, 662. The record unfortunately provides no way to reconcile these statements. Simi larly, it is unclear f rom the testimony whether the use of se quencing \u2014a process designed to ensure the integrity of the targeted ma terial\u2014w ould nevertheless have ma de up for the abse nce of a neg ative control\u2014a devic e desig ned to ensure primer specificity and to guard against contamination. As Dr. Hepner testified, \"if we se quence throug h the vaccine strain nucletide[,] that will dist inguish it from a ny kind of potential con tamination sou rce.\" Cedillo Tr. at 667. Petitioners' failure xamine Dr . Bustin on this point, howev er, essentially means his testimony went uncha lleng ed. Indeed, r espondent notes that the r esults of the Walker g roup's31 investiga tion sti ll have not bee n published. 22sequenc ing of their re sults. Even if we were to assume, howe ver, tha t the spec ial30 master ove rlooked this evidenc e, we are unable to conclude tha t such an omission rises to the leve l of reve rsible er ror. On ba lance , we do not be lieve the fact that the Walker group sequenced a portion\u2014albeit not all\u2014of their results carries enough weight to overcome the special master's con clusion that the Walker group's results were preliminary, unpublished, and not entitled to substantial weight. As petitioners' experts acknow ledged, poster presentations are not subject to peer review and as a result do not receive the scrutiny of the scie ntific community that confe rs an e lement of reliability on published test results. Indeed, r espondent's e xpert Dr . Brian Ward31 testified that based on his own experience, such abstracts often turn out to be wrong. Cedillo Tr. at 1865. We are there fore unwilling to disturb the spec ial master' s finding on this point . See Cox v. Secre tary, Dep' t of Hea lth & Human Ser vs., 30 Fe d. Cl. 136, 144 (1993) (desc ribing as \"ha rmless error\" the specia l master's decision to strike an e xpert re port bec ause the report would not have cha nged the outcome of the case ). III. The Spec ial Master' s Failure to Dec ide a Critical I ssue Having found no evide nce to c onclude that c hildhood vacc ines lead to the development of autism, the special master declined to reach the issue of whether The special master defined phenotype as \"the entire physical, biochemical,32 and phy siologica l makeup of a n individual as deter mined both ge netically and environmenta lly, as opposed (quoting Dorland' s at 1421). The spec ial master we nt on to ex plain: Inhere nt in the definition of a \"phenoty pe\" is the combined effect of genetic and environmental influence s on an indi vidual. Under lying petitioners' argument that regressive autism is a di stinct phenotype is their theory that this ty pe of a utism i s cause d, in part, by environmenta l factors that include childhood vac cines. Id. 23regressive autism is a disti nct phe with dif ferent ca uses than cla ssic the ial master obse rved: [T]he evide nce pr esente d and conside red in this litigation does not support a finding , under the applicable preponde rance of the evidenc e legal standard, tha t postnatal exposure to the vacc ines of intere st leads to the development of autism of any type. Unpe rsuade d that childhood vacc ines lead to the de velopment of autism, the undersig ned nee d not decide whether the evidenc e supports a f inding that reg ressive a utism i 332306, at maintain, however, that the resolution of this issu e is critical to their medica l theory causa lly linking Ya tes's MMR vacc ination to his reg ressive autism. Petit ioners ar gue that in the abse nce of such a deter mination, the special master c ould not have made a rational assessment regar ding the neuroa natomy of autism, D r. redibility , the a ppropriate weig iven Dr. Corbie r's testimony . Petitioners thus urge the c ourt to set the spec ial master' s decision aside on the g round that it is arbitrar y and ca pricious. In support of this poin t, petitioners note that appr oximately 80 perc ent of individua ls with autism suffer f rom classic a utism. P etitioners observe , howeve r, that the majorit y of the e vidence considere d by the spec ial master c oncer ning the neuroanatomy of autism\u2014 particularly the testimony of respondent's expe rt Dr. Rust and the a rticles on which he relied\u2014 fail to distinguish betwee n classic a utism and regressive a utism. P etitioners thus posit that thi s evidenc e may apply only to persons with classic autism a nd not to individuals with regressive autism. A ccording to petitioners, the spec ial master there fore could not ha ve assessed the relevance of such The F ederal Circuit rea ched a simil ar conclusio n in Andre u, a dec ision33 issued one we ek af ter the or al argument in this case. Andr eu, 2009 WL 1688231. In Andre u, the court found that the specia l ma ster had erred by failing t o give sufficie nt weight to the testimony of a tre ating physician. I d. at *5. (L ike Dr. Corbier, Ya tes's trea ting ne urolog ist, the treating physician in Andre u conclude d that a link existed betwee n the vac cine a nd the asser ted injury beca use no other c auses were found and a c lose temporal r elationship exi sted betwe en the va ccina tion and the onset of the injury . See Ha zlehurst Tr. at 299; Andre u, 20 09 WL 1688231, at *6.) Although the Andre u holding would a ppear to streng then petitioners' c ase, the decision is distinguishable in at least one key respect: whil e the respondent in Andreu acknowledged that the p etitioner had presented a biologically plausible medical theory (i.e., satisfying the first prong of the Althen standard), respondent in the instant case has mad e no such conc ession. I ndeed, r espondent's e xpert Dr . MacDonald, when asked about the plausibility of petitioners' medical theory, testified that it was \"f antastic, improbable and . . . most im portantly not based on Tr. a t 643A . Simi in, w hen aske measles virus in the g ut tissue cou ld move throug h the blood into the brain as pe titioners theorized, responde d: \"I just don' t see would be happe ning.\" Cedillo Tr. at 2782A. 24evidenc e mining whe ther re gressive a nd classic autism have the same c auses. Nor, in petitioners' vie w, could the spe cial maste r have r ationally assessed credibility or the appropr iate weig ht to be given his testimony without first determining whether regre ssive autism is a separate phenotype from c lassic autism and correspondingly whether Yates's regression after receiving the MMR vaccination impli cated environmenta l cause s. Petiti oners ex plain that if reg ressive autism is a s eparate phenotype with environmental causes, Dr. Corbier correctly characterized the fact that Yates regressed about a month after receiving the MMR vaccine as h aving \"par amount\" importance a nd the special master acco rdingly should have given his testimony considera bly more we ight. As pe titioners observe, \" treating physicians ar e likely to be in the best position to determine whe ther a 'log ical sequenc e ffect show[s] that the vac cination was the reason .'\" Capizzano, 440 F.3d at 1326 ( quoting Althen, 418 F .3d at 1280). 33 According to respondent, petitioners' contention that regressive autism is distinct from classic autism necessarily depends upon a finding that regressive autism has a distinct cause from classic autism. The problem with petitioners' argument, in responde nt's view, is that it pe titioners of fered no cre dible evidenc e, either through their own expert witnesses or on cross-exami nation of Dr. Rust, to limit the applicability of Dr. Rust's testimony to classic autism and offered no Dr. Rust testified that classic and regressive autism were \"not entirely34 distinct from eac h other,\" but ar e \"distinguished f rom one a nother ve ry reliably by the fact that children [with regressive autism] a re not so severely impaired as those children [with] classic a utism.\" Hazlehurst Tr. at 543A-44A . 25reliable evidenc e of distinct ca uses of regressive autism. Respondent t hus contends that petitioners fa ult the special master for f ailing to dr aw a distinction about the neuroa natomy of re gressive a utism t hat the scie ntific community has not rec ognized and petitioners have not pr oved. Finally , responde nt asserts that whether regressive autism is a separa te phenoty pe has no be aring on Dr. Corbier's credibilit y or on the weig ht to be given his te stimony . In responde nt's view, the specia l master ave D r. Corbier's opinion little weig ht beca use she ha d conclu ded that the evidence underly ing it wa s unreliable. The special master addressed this issue as follows: Petitioners argue that because the body of epide miologica l evidence to date has focused on autism in g eneral and not on the r egressive form of autism in particular, the conclusions of the discussed and cited stu dies have limit ed re levanc e to petitioners' [omnibus proce eding studies of differ ent populatio ns by differ ent re searchers using diff erent study desig ns have f ailed n the MMR ine, thimerosal-c ontaining vaccines, the onset of autism , and the development of g astrointestinal symptoms. That the collective body of epidemiologica l evidence has consistently failed to sh ow any association ma kes petitioners' claims of a c ausal re lationship less li kely. Moreove r, eve n if many of the conducte d studies were not desig ned to examine whether an association exists between re gressive a utism and the vac cines of interest in t his litigation, at least two of the conducte d studies specific ally looked for a n association betwee n the MMR vacc ine and the deve lopment of reg and found *39. Contrary to t in fact disti nguished betwe en classic and regressive autism, but did not attribute the significance to t his34 distinction t hat petitioners urge . Asked a bout Dr. Corbier' s theory regarding the effect of environmental factors on the development of reg ressiv e autism, Dr. Rust testified that \"the e merg ing vie w of a utism as I 've de scribed is the w orking out of a genetic de velopment of bra in that doesn't deve lop properly , and the de gree of that26abnormality helps to differentiate the time of the onset of subtypes of autistic disorders.\" Hazlehurst Tr. a t 527A-28A. Fur ther, whe n asked directly if there are differ ent g enetic or environmenta l factors involved in the causa tion of classic ve rsus regressive a utism, Dr. Rust responded that he did not \"think that environmenta l factors are involved at all in any way .\" Ha zlehurst Tr. at 550A. Given the above, we can find no fault with the special master's declining to draw a distinction between classic and regressive autism that the scie ntific community itself has not identified and f or which petitioners have of fered no proof . The spec ial master found that petitioners had f ailed to offe r persuasive evide nce tha t the M MR vaccine ca uses any type of autism a nd there fore did not ne ed to deter mine whether regressive autism ha s a differ ent cause than classic a utism. That conclusion, we be lieve, wa s entirely proper . CONCL USION In hearing this appeal, the c ourt is not without s ympathy for Ya tes, the Hazlehursts, and the other children and families dealing with autism a nd autism spectrum disorde rs. And this court, li ke the specia l master, ac knowledg es both the burdens many of these f amilies have f aced and the tre mendous love and suppor t they have show n their childre n. The fa cts, howeve r, do not support petitioners' a ppeal and we have no c hoice but to deny their motion. Accor dingly , for the r easons se t forth above , the spec ial master' s decision of F ebrua ry 12, 2009, is AFF IRMED. s/John P. W iese John P. Wie se Judge "}
