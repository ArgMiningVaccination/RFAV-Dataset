The Vital Force maintains the sensations and activities of all the parts of the living organism in a harmony that obliges wonderment. The reasoning spirit who inhabits the organism can thus freely use this healthy living instrument to reach the lofty goal of human existence. The highest ideal of cure is the rapid, gentle and permanent restoration of health.\" Samuel Hahnemann, MD, Founder of Homeopathic Medicine circa 1800. Homeopathy is the sophisticated science of holistic medicine that is widely recognized all over the world. England's Royal London Homeopathic Hospital now serves 17,000 patients per year and has been in operation since 1849. In France, Germany, Greece, Russia, India, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina, there are licensed Homeopathic medical schools and hospitals. In the U.S., around 1900, there were 20 Homeopathic medical schools and over 100 Homeopathic hospitals, with 25% of all urban American physicians practicing Homeopathy. HOW HOMEOPATHY WORKS Homeopathy uses principles that are inherent in all natural healing and are as basic as the laws of gravity. Its foundation principle is, like Cures Like - Similia Similibus Curentur. Cure occurs when the sick person is given that substance which can cause the symptoms of their sickness in a healthy person. This principle has been found in the works of Hippocrates, father of modern medicine, and throughout the history of herbal medicine. However it was not until the 1700s that the prodigal German physician, Samuel Christian Hahnemann elucidated this medical science, which has continued to evolve to this day. Homeopathy is a natural pharmaceutical science that uses energies which are derived from the vegetal, mineral, and animal kingdoms. These homeopathic medicines are prepared by being infinitesimally diluted, which renders them free from side effects. Therefore they are especially effective, gentle, and easy to administer to sensitive patients, during pregnancy, infants, and children. With Homeopathy one has to arrive at the exact prescription which corresponds to the whole person. One has to get it just right. The accurately prescribed single homeopathic medicine, known as the Similimum, effects profound balances in one's energetic metabolism to clear away the causative roots of disease, and deep psychological blockages. In the homeopathic consultation, the temperament, together with physical constitutional traits and symptoms, is carefully understood and traced through to childhood, sometimes going back to the prenatal period and the past generation. This process, which requires great skill and perception, yields an understanding of the causational states of disease. The Similimum is then selected. We are proud to offer the most advanced techniques in case receiving using the highly effective Synergy Method; an integrated approach of the Genius, Symptom, and System by Dr. Rajan Sankaran. Each new case is filmed, transcribed and carefully studied. Our office utilizes the most up-to-date computerized homeopathic databases and analysis programs to ensure optimal results. The Similimum has the power to stimulate the entire organism to heal itself. It sets up a curative response that works on many levels - energetic, physical, mental, emotional, and inherited-genetic, enabling a resolution of even some of the most difficult illnesses. Homeopathy, therefore, has a wide field of applicability and can be used to treat most disorders, be they physical, psychosomatic, or psychological in nature.
