Louise Brown, Director of the Shadyside Hospital Foundation, and Dottie Beckwith have been the strongest supporters of the Center over the years. Without their support, the Center would never have made it past its first decade. The Steering Committee included leadership from UPMC Shadyside administration, medical staff, and nursing/ clinical services along with business leaders, financial gurus, philanthropists, and health care consumers. This helped launch the Center for Complementary Medicine and chart the course, developing the business model and securing financial support. How did we get where we are today? It's all about the people. Our cofounder and subsequent Medical Director was a psychiatrist and cognitive neuroscientist, David Servan -Schreiber, MD, PhD . Dr. Servan -Schreiber helped put the Center on solid footing, but unfortunately, his clinical career was cut short by cancer. After leaving the Center, he launched a second career as a writer and speaker, with best -selling books in France, the U.S,, and worldwide on holistic approaches to the management of mental health disorders and cancer. These books are Instinct to Heal \u2014Curing Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Without Drugs and Without Talk Therapy and Anticancer: A New Way of Life. Ronald Glick, MD has had the pleasure of serving as Medical Director over the last 16 years. Under his leadership, the Center has grown in terms of number of clinicians, services offered, and patients served. He also established the educational component, allowing us to teach medical students and resident physicians about integrative and holistic health. Carol Greco, PhD, has had a major influence in two areas. She has offered the Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction program over the last 13 years, with over 800 individuals going through this training. Wearing this hat, she has taught and guided countless mental health and health practitioners on the use of mindfulness -oriented approaches in their work with clients. Additionally, she has served as Research Director for the Center and been principal investigator on over $4,000,000 in federal grants. One of these projects, the HEAL studies, center on an understanding non - specific factors, sometimes referred to as the placebo effect, in optimizing health outcomes in both complementary and mainstream medical approaches. The administrative support from the Departments of Psychiatry and Family Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine have helped shape the Center into one of the leading university -based integrative health programs in the country. The administrative team at the Center sets the tone for the healing environment. In 1997, Shadyside Hospital established the Center for Complementary Medicine, the first hospital -based holistic medicine program in Pittsburgh. In that same year, Shadyside Hospital merged with Presbyterian University Hospital, as a cornerstone of the developing University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Fred Rubin, MD, the Chair of the Department of Medicine at what became UPMC Shadyside, was the driving force and founder and served as the initial Medical Director. The services offered included biofeedback, acupuncture, massage therapy, therapeutic touch, and hypnosis. Over the last 20 years, complementary and integrative health programs around the country have opened with many not surviving their first five years \u2014so celebrating two decades places the Center in the company of a small handful of programs, such as the Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of Arizona, founded by Andrew Weil in 1994. The recipe for our success was charted early in our formation. What ingredients went into the plans? Respond to a need: Patients drive healthcare. Standard medical care does a very good job when treating acute illness. Many individuals experience chronic disabling conditions, such as osteoarthritis, spinal pain, migraines, irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, and fatigue. While biomedical approaches can help each of these conditions, given an incomplete response, many patients ask their physicians \"What other things can I try?\" Medicine focuses on treatments with strong research support, at the same time recognizing that non -traditional treatments may help some of these patients. Establishing a program within the academic medical center assures patients that services are provided in a manner consistent with our knowledge and skills. Assemble a strong clinical team: From the start, we took care to involve clinicians who embody the qualities that facilitate healing. Everyone who has dealt with a severe illness has tales of the kindness and expertise of the physicians, nurses, and health care practitioners they worked with. They also have a few stories of times when things did not go as well. We've been fortunate that our clinical staff falls into that first category. You're in the room with them for an hour, and you walk out feeling you're on the path to healing. Have friends in high places: As founder and initial Medical Director, Dr. Rubin had the foresight to establish an advisory board, Spring/Summer 2018 The Center for Integrative Medicine Turns 20!

The 20 amazing clinicians at the Cen- ter bring their clinical and interpersonal skills to their work; their energy helps our patients improve their symptoms and outlook. Where will things go in the next 20 years? The vision is that there will be only one \"Medicine\" that the approaches we identi- fy today as integrative or complementary, will be incorporated into standard medical practice, as our understanding of the biol- ogy and benefit of these approaches advances. Some of the milestones in this field and with the Center include: 1991\u2014the National Institutes of Health establishes the Of- fice of Alternative Medicine (OAM). 1993\u2014David Eisenberg publishes research in the New Eng- land Journal of Medicine estimating that one in three Ameri- cans uses some form of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) therapy over the prior year. This is later replicated, by Dr. Eisenberg and by the National Health Information Survey, with the CAM usage increasing in re- cent years. 1997\u2014the Center for Complementary Medicine at UPMC Shadyside is founded. 1998\u2014OAM is renamed the Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) with an expanded pres- ence in the advancement of research and training in the field. More recently, the name was changed to the Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH). 2000\u2014the University of Arizona establishes fellowship training in Integrative Medicine. 2002\u2014the Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine and Health (Consortium) is founded, initially with eight academic medical centers with integrative health programs in clinical care, research, and education. 2003\u2014the Center for Integrative Medicine, representing the University of Pittsburgh, joins the consortium as part of the 2nd wave of membership, with 19 hospital systems from around the country represented. 2006\u2014the Consortium establishes the North American Research Conference on Complementary and Integrative Medicine, now a biennial event entitled the International Congress on Integrative Medicine and Health. 2007\u2014Bravenet is established as a practice -based research network, facilitating multicenter research collaboration. 2011\u2014the Institute of Medicine releases a monograph, Re- lieving Pain in America . This report identifies pain as a serious public health concern and proposes policy changes and re- sources that need to be devoted to pain management. This conservative expert panel endorses the use of complemen- tary and integrative approaches in pain management. 2012\u2014the Archives of Internal Medicine publishes a meta - analysis by A.J. Vickers reviewing the treatment of almost 18,000 patients finding a significant reduction in pain for The UPMC Center for Integrative Medicine is dedicated to increas- ing knowledge about the effectiveness and safety of complementary and integrative medicine approaches. Other integrative medicine modali ties may not have been subjected to the same level of scien- tific inquiry as western medicine treatments. The Center for Inte- grative Medicine, in concert with the University of Pittsburgh, is ac- tively pursuing research to support the benefits of these therapies. Research Announcements The Center for Integrative Medicine is proud to announce a new research project that focuses on measuring Mindfulness. Drs. Carol Greco and David Victorson (of Northwestern University) are the leaders of the study, which is funded by the National Institutes of Health. acupuncture as compared to sham or placebo treatment for chronic pain. 2016\u2014UPMC Health Plan begins coverage of acupuncture for four pain conditions for most of the individual and group and Health Plans. 2018\u2014the Consortium, now under the name of Academic Consortium for Integrative Medicine & Health, grows to 72 North American hospital systems, taking it closer to the goal of involving half of the medical schools in the States.

John Laird and Sari Cohen, in a discussion focusing on health nutrition, the guided use of supplements and botanical medicine, and management of several common health conditions. Additionally, Luann Scarton, RD, a functional nutrition specialist will present on dietary approaches. Naturopathic medicine is one of the best kept secrets in healthcare. Naturopathic physicians or Doctors of Naturopathic Medicine (NDs) complete a four -year full - time graduate -level program at one of seven brick -and- mortar naturopathic medicine colleges in the U.S. and Canada. Thanks to the tireless work of State Representative Mark Mustio, the Pennsylvania Legislature passed a bill in 2016 which will create a procedure for regulating naturopathic physicians under the PA State Board of Medicine, making Pennsylvania the 20th state to offer this credentialing. State Senator John Rafferty and State Senator Jay Costa have co -sponsored legislation that would provide for full licensure and expand the scope of practice Naturopathic Doctors in the State of Pennsylvania. Senate Bill 834 is currently waiting for a vote in the Senate Professional Licensure Committee. NDs are trained in traditional medical subjects, such as anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, pathophysiology, immunology, biochemistry, and pharmacology. They learn physical diagnosis, and Dr. John Laird utilizes this skill in his work as a faculty member in the Physician Assistant program at Chatham University. While there is much overlap with traditionally trained medical physicians, the focus and orientation of their training and practice have several differences. Key in the orientation of naturopathic physicians are a focus on prevention, a detailed understanding of dietary factors that may contribute to health problems and can be modified, and the judicious use of nutritional supplements and herbs to support wellness. In healthcare, we're all working from the same medical literature; NDs incorporate this understanding to guide their treatment recommendations.
