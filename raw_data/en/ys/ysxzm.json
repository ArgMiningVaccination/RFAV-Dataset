TERMINATION This section tells you under what conditions your coverage under this Plan will terminate and the date that the coverage will end. In the event a Member's coverage is terminated pursuant to Sections 2.1 and 2.2 below, the coverage of his Dependents will also be terminated. 2.1 Termination by the CO -OP The CO -OP may terminate coverage under this Plan at the times shown for any one or more of the following reasons: If premium payments for the Subscriber and enrolled Dependents are not received by the CO -OP within the Grace Period defined in this EOC, Coverage shall automatically terminate without further notice to Subscriber. A Grace Period of ten (10) day will be granted for the payment of each premium due after the first premium, during which the EOC will continue in force. The date of termination will be the last day of the month for which premi um payments have been received and accepted by the CO -OP. If a Member performs an act or practice that constitutes fraud, or makes any intentional misrepresentation of material fact, as prohibited by the terms of coverage, the CO -OP has the right to rescin d coverage and declare coverage under the Plan null and void as of the date of the occurrence of the fraud or intentional misrepresentation of material fact, or, if later, the original Effective Date of Coverage, and refund any applicable premium after de ducting any costs incurred by the CO -OP as a result of the fraud or intentional misrepresentation. Acts of fraud or misrepresentation include the Member allowing his or any other Member's CO -OP ID Card to be used by any other person, or using another pers on's CO -OP ID Card, and knowingly furnishing incorrect or incomplete information to the CO -OP in order to obtain benefits for the Subscriber, enrolled Dependents, or a non -enrolled individual. The Member will be liable to the CO -OP for all costs incurred a s a result of the fraud, misrepresentation or misuse of the CO -OP ID Card. Thirty (30) days written notice shall be provided to the Member prior to any rescission of coverage. A Member has the right to appeal any such rescission. If a Member is no longer eligible for coverage through the Plan for any reason, including, without limitation, the Member's loss of residency in the State of Nevada, the date of termination will be the last day of the month following the month in which the notice is sent by the CO -OP. If the CO -OP discontinues coverage for this particular Health Plan in the State of Nevada, Coverage under this Evidence of Coverage will terminate. A 180 day written notice of termination will be provided by the CO -OP and mailed to the Subscriber's address of record. Subscriber, and his enrolled Dependents, will have the option of purchasing other health insurance offered by the CO -OP in the individual mar ket. If the CO -OP ceases to offer coverage in the individual market in the State of Nevada, Coverage under this Evidence of Coverage will terminate. A 180 day written notice 8 of termination will be provided by the CO -OP and mailed to the Subscriber's addres s of record. If a Subscriber changes from this Plan to another through open/special enrollment, the last day of coverage in the Plan will be the day before the effective date of coverage in his or her new plan. 2.2 Termination by the Subscriber Subscriber has the right to terminate his coverage under this Plan upon prior written notice to the CO -OP. Such termination is effective the first of the month following receipt of the Subscriber's written notice of termination. Cancellation of Subscriber's membership wi ll also terminate Coverage for Subscriber's enrolled Dependents. There are no pro -rated refunds given for terminating coverage in the middle of the month, and all coverage begins at the beginning of the month according to the policies and guidelines outlined in this Evidence of Coverage. All premiums are paid before the month of coverage, and once paid, are non -refundable. 2.3 Reinstatement If any renewal premium is not paid within the time granted the Subscriber for payment, a subsequent acceptance of prem ium by the CO -OP or by any agent duly authorized by the CO -OP to accept such premium, without requiring in connection therewith an application for reinstatement, shall reinstate the EOC; provided, however, that if the CO -OP or such agent requires an applic ation for reinstatement and issues a conditional receipt for the premium tendered, the EOC will be reinstated upon approval of such application by the CO -OP or, lacking such approval, upon the forty -fifth (45th) day following the date of such conditional r eceipt unless the CO -OP has previously notified the Subscriber in writing of its disapproval of such application. The reinstated EOC shall cover only loss resulting from such accidental Injury as may be sustained after the date of reinstatement and loss du e to such sickness as may begin more than ten (10) days after such date. In all other respects the CO -OP and Subscriber shall have the same rights thereunder as they had under the EOC immediately before the due date of the defaulted premium, subject to any provisions endorsed herein or attached hereto in connection with the reinstatement. Any premium accepted in connection with a reinstatement shall be applied to a period for which premium has not been previously paid, but not to any period more than sixty (60) days prior to the date of reinstatement. 2.4 Rescission As set forth in Section 2.1 above, if a Member performs an act or practice that constitutes fraud or makes any intentional material misrepresentation of fact or material omission to the CO - OP, it sha ll be cause for termination and rescission of the Coverage of the Member about whom the material misrepresentation of fact or material omission pertains. The CO -OP will timely notify Subscriber regarding such rescission and the CO -OP will refund any premiu m amounts paid by Subscriber minus any claims paid to providers on behalf of Subscriber, or Subscriber's 9 enrolled Dependents. The CO -OP will seek reimbursement from the Subscriber for any amounts paid that exceed the premiums received. The CO -OP will not p rovide Coverage following the date of rescission and will not be responsible for any charges incurred on or after the date of rescission. Misrepresentations of fact include, but are not limited to the following: 1. any failure to disclose to the CO -OP the Member's tobacco use prior to the effective date of Coverage hereunder; 2. any misrepresentation of a Member's age; and 3. any material false statements or omissions in any part of the Enrollment Application.

Coverage for the adult primary Subscriber sh all be terminated if the adult primary subscriber has committed an act of fraud or has made an intentional misrepresentation of material fact by submitting an application that contains material misstatement or commission. If Coverage is rescinded or termin ated under this provision, Dependents listed on the Enrollment Application for whom there was no misrepresentation of fact, except as stated above, will remain in force on the Evidence of Coverage. 2.5 Effect of Termination No benefits will be paid under this Plan by the CO -OP for services provided after termination of a Member's coverage under this Plan. The Member will be responsible for payment of medical services and supplies incurred after the Effective Date of the termination. SECTION 3. CARE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM This section tells you about the CO -OP's Care Management Program. 3.1 Care Management Program The CO -OP's Care Management Program, using the services of professional medical peer review committees, utilization review committees, and/or the Medical Director, determines whether services and supplies are Medically Necessary. The CO -OP's Care Management Program helps direct care to the most appropriate setting to provide healthcare in a cost -effective manner. 3.2 Care Management Program Requirements The CO -OP's Care Management Program requires the Member, Plan Providers and the CO-OP to work together. All Plan Providers have agreed to participate in the CO -OP's Care Management Program. Plan Providers have agreed to accept the CO -OP's Reimbursement Schedule amount as payment in full for Covered Services, less the Member's 10 payment of any applicable Copayment, Deductible or Coinsurance amount, whereas Non-Plan Providers have not. In no event will the CO -OP pay more than the maximum payment allowance established in the C O-OP Reimbursement Schedule. It is the Member's responsibility to verify that the Provider selected is a Plan Provider before receiving any non -Emergency Services and to comply with all other rules of the CO -OP's Care Management Program. When required, co mpliance by the Member with the CO -OP's Care Management Program is mandatory. Failure to comply with the rules of the CO -OP's Care Management Program means the Member will be responsible for costs of services received. 3.3 Care Management Program Process The Care Management Program's medical professionals may review proposed services and supplies to be received by a Member to determine: If the services are Medically Necessary and/or appropriate. The appropriateness of the proposed setting. The required durati on of treatment or admission. Following review, the CO -OP will complete the Prior Authorization form and send a copy to the Provider and the Member. The Prior Authorization form will specify approved Covered Services and supplies. Prior Authorization is not a guarantee of payment for Covered Services . The final decision as to whether or not any care should be received is between the Member and the Provider. If the CO -OP denies a request by a Member and/or Provider for Prior Authorization of a service or s upply, the Member or Provider may appeal the denial to the CO - OP's Advocacy Department (see the Appeals Procedures Section herein). 3.4 Services Requiring Prior Authorization Certain Covered Services require Prior Authorization and review through the CO -OP's Care Management Program. The Attachment A Benefit Schedule shows which Covered Services require Prior Authorization. You do not need prior authorization in order to obtain access to OB/GYN care from a Provider who specializes in obstetrics or gynecology. Th e Provider, however, may be required to comply with certain procedures, including obtaining Prior Authorization for certain services, following a preapproved treatment plan or procedures for making referrals. For a list of current Plan Providers call (702 ) 823-2667 or (855 ) 606 -2667 or view the list online at www.nevadahealthcoop.org . For medical care that requires Prior Authorization, you may notify us as follows: Have the Physician call us at ( 855) 897-0316 ; 11 Call us di rectly at (702) 823 -2667 or (855 ) 606 -2667; Have an authorized representative call the CO -OP on your behalf, if it is not possible for you or your Provider to call the CO -OP. 3.5 Emergency Admission Notification The Member must report all em ergency admissions to the CO -OP Care Department within 24 hours of admission or as soon as reasonably possible to authorize continue d care at (702) 823 -2667 or (855 ) 606 -2667. Members requiring Emergency Services will not be required to obtain Prior Authorization from the CO -OP prior to receiving an initial medical screening examination and any immediate treatments or services necessary to stabilize a condition. This applies to both Plan Providers and non -Plan Providers. If you are faced with a medical emergency, call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room. All emergency admissions are reviewed Retrospectively to determine if the treatment received was Medically Necessary and appropriate and was for Emergency Services as defined in this EOC. 3.6 Hospitalist Program Inpatient Care from Hospitalist Program physician. If a Member is admitted as an inpatient at a Hospital at which a Hospitalist Program exists, the Member is subject to the Hospitalist Program. (a) Inpatient care by the Hospitalist Program physicians is req uired for all Members. This is inpatient care by primary care physicians only. Primary care physicians are general practice, family practice and internal medicine Physicians. The Hospitalist Program does not include Physician care by specialists such as ca rdiologists, dermatologists, oncologists or anesthesiologists. For purposes of the Hospitalist Program only, OB/GYN and pediatric Physicians are considered specialists, not primary care physicians. For inpatient Physician primary care under the Hospitalist Program, the Plan will pay the full Allowable Expense including any copays, coinsurance and Deductibles. The Member will not have any out of pocket expenses for covered services by Hospitalist Program physicians. Care by specialists will continue to be co vered and paid as normal under the Plan's Rules. (b) If the Member refuses care from the Hospitalist Program physician and instead accepts inpatient Hospital care from his own primary care physician (not including OB/GYN and pediatric Physicians) or any other non-specialist Hospital based Physician outside of the Hospitalist Program, the Plan will pay nothing for such care and the Member will be solely responsible for all amounts billed by such primary care physician. (c) A Member who has been admitted and is recei ving care from a Hospitalist Program physician also may accept care from his pre -established primary care physician who has been actively involved in the Member's ongoing primary care. However, his pre -established 12 primary care physician providing care to a n admitted Member will be reimbursed by the Plan for a consultation only and will not be the manager of the Member's inpatient care. 3.7 Independent Medical Review; Appeals Rights The CO -OP may require a Member to have an Independent Medical Review prior to issuing Prior Authorization for any medical benefits. In that case, only a Physician or Chiropractor who is certified to practice in the same field of practice as the primary treating Physician or Chiropractor or who is formally educated in that field will conduct the review. The Independent Medical Review will include a physical exam of the Member and a personal review of all x -rays and reports made by the primary treating Physician or Chiropractor. A certified copy of all reports of findings will be sent to the primary treating Physician or Chiropractor and the Member within ten (10) business days after the review. If the Member disagrees with the findings of the review, he must submit an appeal for binding arbitration to the CO -OP within thirty (30) days after he receives the report. Please refer to the Appeals Procedures Section in this EOC for more information. 3.8 Appeals Rights All decisions of the CO -OP's Care Management Program may be appealed by the Member through the Appeals Procedures as described in Section 10 . If an imminent and serious threat to the health of the Member exists, the appeal will be directed to the CO -OP's Medical Director. SECTION 4. OBTAINING COVERED SERVICES This section tells you under what conditions services are available under this Plan and your obligations as a Member. You should also carefully review the Exclusions and Limitations Sections (Section 6 and Section 7, respectively) prior to obtaining any healthcare services. 4.1 Availability of Covered Services Members are entitled to receive Medically Necessary Covered Services set forth in Section 5 herein and the Attachment A Benefit Schedule, subject to all terms and conditions of this EOC and payment of required premium. 4.2 Continuity of Care from Plan Providers Termination of a Plan Provider's contract will not release the Provider from treating a Member, except for reasons of medical incompetence or professional misconduct as determined by the CO -OP. Coverage provided under this section is available until the latest of the following dates: The 120th day following the date the contract was terminated between the Provider and the CO -OP; or 13 If the medical condition is pregnancy, the 45th day after the date of delivery or if the pregnancy does not end in delivery the date of the end of th e pregnancy.

COORDINATION OF BENEFITS (COB) This section tells you how other health insurance you may have affects your coverage under this Plan. 8.1 The Purpose of COB Coordination of Benefits (COB) is intended to help contain the cost of providing healthcare coverage. If, with respect to a Member covered under this policy, benefits for an allowable expense incurred during a claim determination period under this policy, together with benefits for allowable expense during such period under all other valid coverage (without giving effect to this provision or to any \"coordination of benefits provision\" applying to such other valid coverage), exceed the total of such individual's allowable expense during such period, the CO - OP is liable only for such proportionate amount of the benefits for allowable expense under this policy during such period as (a) the total allowable expense during such period bea rs to (b) the 39 total amount of benefits payable during such period for such expense under this policy and all other valid coverage (without giving effect to this provision or to any \"coordination of benefits provision\" applying to such other valid coverage) less in both (a) and (b) any amount of benefits for allowable expense payable under other valid coverage which does not contain a \"coordination of benefits provision.\" In no event shall this section operate to increase the amount of benefits for allowabl e expense payable under this EOC with respect to a Member above the amount which would have been paid in the absence of this section. 8.2 Benefits Subject to COB All of the healthcare benefits provided under this EOC are subject to this Section. The Member ag rees to permit the CO -OP to coordinate its obligations under this EOC with payments under any other valid coverage. 8.3 Definitions Some words in this Section have a special meaning to meet the needs of this Section. These words and their meaning when used are: (a) \"Allowable Expense \" means 100 percent of any necessary, reasonable and customary item of expense which is covered, in whole or in part, as a hospital, surgical, medical or major medical expense under this policy or under any other valid coverage. (b) \"Claim Determination Period \" means the each Contract Year during which allowable expense covered under this policy is incurred on account of such person. (c) \"Coordination of benefits provision \" means this provision and any other provision which may reduce an ins urer's liability because of the existence of benefits under other valid coverage. (d) \"Other valid coverage \" includes hospital, surgical, medical or major medical benefits provided by individual, group or family -type coverage, government programs or worker s' compensation. Other valid coverage does not include automobile medical payments or third -party liability coverage. 8.4 When COB Applies COB applies when a Member covered under this Plan is also entitled to receive payment for or provision of some or all of the same Covered Services from another source of valid coverage. 8.5 Right to Receive and Release Information In order to decide if this coordination of benefits provision applies to a claim, the CO -OP (without the consent of or notice to any person) has the r ight to the following: 40 (a) Release to any person, insurance company or organization, the necessary claim information. (b) Receive from any person, insurance company or organization, the necessary claim information. (c) require any person claiming benefits under this Plan to give the CO -OP any information needed by the CO -OP to coordinate those benefits. 8.6 Facility of Payment If another insurer makes a payment that should have been made by the CO -OP, then the CO-OP has the right to pay the other insurer any amount necess ary to satisfy the CO -OP's obligation. Any amount paid shall be deemed to be benefits paid under this Plan, and to the extent of such payments, the CO -OP shall be fully discharged from liability under this Plan. If by application of any of the coordinatio n of benefits provision, the CO -OP effects a material reduction of benefits otherwise payable under the EOC, the insurer shall refund to the Member any unearned premium by reason of such reduction of coverage during the policy year current and that next pr eceding at the time the loss commenced. No such reduction of benefits or refund will be made unless the unearned premium amounts to $5 or more. 8.7 Right to Recover Payment If the amount of benefit payment exceeds the amount needed to satisfy the CO -OP's oblig ation under this section, the CO -OP has the right to recover the excess amount from the Member or the assignee or beneficiary of the Member. The amount of other valid coverage which is on a provision of service basis shall be computed as the amount the ser vices rendered would have cost in the absence of such coverage. 8.8 Medicare This provision describes how the CO -OP coordinates and pays benefits when a Member is also enrolled in Medicare and duplication of Coverage occurs. If a Member is not enrolled in Medi care or receiving benefits, there is no duplication of Coverage and the CO -OP does not have to coordinate with Medicare. The benefits under this Evidence of Coverage are not intended to duplicate any benefits to which Members are entitled under Medicare. A ll sums payable under such programs for services provided shall be payable to and retained by the CO -OP. Each Member shall complete and submit to the CO -OP such consents, releases, assignments and other documents as may be requested by the CO -OP in order t o obtain or assure reimbursement under Medicare or any other government program for which Members are eligible. In cases where Medicare or another government program has primary responsibility, Medicare benefits will be taken into account for any Member wh o is enrolled for Medicare. This will be done before the benefits under this Health Plan are calculated. 41 Charges for services used to satisfy a Member's Medicare Part B deductible will be applied in the order received by the CO -OP. Two or more charges for services received at the same time will be applied starting with the largest first. Any rules for coordination of benefits will be applied after the CO -OP's benefits have been calculated under the rules in this provision. Allowable Expenses will be reduce d by any Medicare benefits available for those expenses. This provision will apply to the maximum extent permitted by federal or state law. The CO-OP will not reduce the benefits due any Member because of a Member's eligibility for Medicare where federal law requires that the CO -OP determine its benefits for that Member without regard to the benefits available under Medicare. 8.9 Workers' compensation The benefits which a Member is entitled to receive under this Evidence of Coverage are not designed to duplica te any benefits to which the Member is entitled under workers' compensation law. The CO -OP is entitled to reimbursement for any services that have been reimbursed under a workers' compensation claim. 1. Member is required to file for workers' compensation when an employment related accident, illness or injury occurs. 2. If Member's workers' compensation carrier denies a claim, Member may submit the claim to the CO -OP with a copy of the denial for consideration under this Evidence of Coverage. All plan provi sions of this Evidence of Coverage will apply in the consideration process for payment under this plan. 3. Workers' compensation claims that are not a benefit under this Evidence of Coverage are not payable by the CO -OP. 4. Any benefits payable are subject to all provisions of this Evidence of Coverage, including but not limited to the Precertification requirements. SECTION 9. GENERAL PROVISIONS 9.1 Relationship of Parties The relationship between the CO -OP and Plan Providers is an independent contractor relationship. Pl an Providers are not agents or employees of the CO -OP; nor is the CO -OP, or any employee of the CO -OP, an employee or agent of a Plan Provider. The CO -OP is not liable for any claim or demand on account of damages as a result of, or in any manner connected with, any Injury suffered by a Member while receiving care from any Plan Provider or in any Plan Provider's facility. The CO -OP is not bound by statements or promises made by its Plan Providers. 42 9.2 Entire Agreement This EOC, including Attachment A Benefit Schedule and any other Attachments, Endorsements, Riders or Amendments to it, the Member's Enrollment Form, health statements, Member Identification Card, and all other applications received by the CO -OP constitutes the entire agreement between the Member and the CO -OP and as of its Effective Date, replaces all other agreements between the parties. 9.3 Nondiscrimination The CO -OP will not refuse to insure, refuse to enroll, refuse to continue insurance, refuse to renew insurance, cancel insurance, or limit the amount, duration or scope of Coverage or benefits available to an individual in a manner arbitrarily discriminating on the basis of race, color, national origin, disability, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender ide ntity, diagnosis or medical condition. This EOC provides Coverage for all Essential Health Benefits deemed Medically Necessary for a Member, without arbitrary discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, disability, age, sex, sexual orienta tion, gender identity, diagnosis or medical condition. If you believe the CO -OP has discriminated against you on the basis of any of these factors, you may file a complaint with the Office of Civil Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services. For more information, see the Office of Civil Rights website at http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/complaints/index.html . 9.4 Contestability Any and all statements made to the CO -OP by any Subscriber or Dependent, will, in the absence of fraud, be considered representations and not warranties. Also, no statement, unless it is contained in a written application for coverage, shall be used in defense to a claim under this Plan. No agent or em ployee of the CO -OP is authorized to change the form or content of this Plan or waive any of its provisions. Such changes can be made only through an amendment authorized and signed by an officer of the CO -OP.

Possession of a CO - OP identification card does not give the holder any right to services or other benefits under this Plan. To be entitled to such services or benefits, the holder of the card must in fact be a Member and all applicable premiums must actually have been paid. Any person not entitled to receive services or other benefits will be liable for the actual cost of such services or benefits. 43 9.6 Notice Any notice under this Plan may be given by United States mail, first class, postage prepaid, addressed as follows: Nevada Health CO -OP 3900 Meadows Lane, Suite 214 Las Vegas, Nevada 89107 Notice to a Member will be sent to the Member's last known address. 9.7 Interpretation of the EOC The laws of Nevada shall be applied to interpretation of this EOC except to the extent federal law preempts such State laws. 9.8 Assignment All rights of Members hereunder are personal to each Member and are not assignable or otherwise transferable except tha t a Member may assign his or her rights to benefits to a Provider who provided Covered Services.

Providers and Members may ask the CO -OP to cover new technology by submitting a written request to the CO -OP's New Technology Committee. When the CO -OP receives such a request, the CO -OP's New Technology Committee conducts a thorough investigation of the procedure, medication, treatment, or device. The CO -OP's New Technology Committee will research cu rrent related medical literature and medical practice and thoroughly discuss the findings in order to make a decision on the coverage request. 9.13 Overpayments The CO -OP has the right to correct and/or collect benefit payments for healthcare services made in e rror.

The Member will then have at lea st 48 hours to provide the additional information. The Plan will notify the Member of its decision as soon as possible and within 48 hours after (1) all necessary information is provided, or (2) the 48 hours the Member has in which to provide the necessary information ends, whichever is sooner. In general, an \"Urgent Care Claim\" is a Claim for which using the usual Claim determination period could seriously jeopardize the life or health of the claimant. Concurrent Care Claim . If the CO -OP has approved an on going course of treatment to be provided over a period of time or number of treatments and reduces or terminates coverage of such course of treatment (other than by Plan amendment or termination) before the end of such period of time or number of treatment s, the CO -OP will notify the Member at a time sufficiently in advance of the reduction or termination to allow the Member to appeal and obtain a determination before the benefit is reduced or terminated. Subject to the following paragraph, such request ma y be treated as a new Claim for Benefits and decided within the timeframes applicable to either a Pre -Service Claim or a Post -Service Claim, as appropriate; provided, however, any appeal of such a determination must be made within a reasonable time and may not be afforded the full 180 day period as described in the Appeals Procedures Section herein. Any request by a Member to extend the course of treatment beyond the period of time or number of treatments for an Urgent Care Claim shall be decided as soon as possible. The CO -OP shall notify the Member within twenty -four (24) hours after receipt of the Claim for Benefits by the Plan, provided that the request is received at least twenty -four (24) hours prior to the expiration of the authorized period of time o r number of treatments. If the request is not made at least twenty -four (24) hours prior to the expiration of the authorized period of time or number of treatments, the request will be treated as an Urgent Care Claim. Pre-Service Claim . If a Member makes a Claim for benefits before receiving the benefits, and it is neither an Urgent Care Claim or a Concurrent Care Claim, the Claim will be decided within a reasonable time no longer than 15 days after receipt of the Claim. However, an additional 15 days may be needed if there are special circumstances beyond the Plan's control. If so, the Member will be given notice of the special circumstances before the end of the first 15 days and told whether additional information is needed to decide the claim. The Membe r will have at least 45 days to provide the additional information. Keep in mind that only where Prior Authorization is required will such a request prior to receiving benefits be an official Claim. 48 The Plan will notify the Member if a request for Prior A uthorization is not sufficient to be a Claim as soon as possible, but in any event not later than five (5) days (24 hours in a case of an Urgent Care Claim), and tell the Member how to submit a proper claim for prior approval of treatment. Post-Service Cl aims . If a Member makes a Claim for benefits after receiving the treatment, and it is neither an Urgent Care Claim or a Concurrent Care Claim, the Claim will be decided within a reasonable time, no longer than 30 days after receipt of the Claim. However, a n additional 15 days may be needed if there are special circumstances beyond the Plan's control. If so, the Member will be given notice of the special circumstances before the end of the first 30 days and told whether additional information is needed to de cide the Claim. The Member will have at least 45 days to provide the additional information. 9.24 Notification of an Adverse Benefit Determination If you receive an Adverse Benefit Determination, you will be provided in writing information sufficient to identif y the claim involved and informed in writing of the following: The specific reason or reasons for upholding the Adverse Benefit Determination; The date of service; The name of the health care provider; The claim amount; Notification that you may request, a nd the Plan will provide upon request, the diagnosis code and treatment code along with the corresponding meaning of such codes; The reason for the Adverse Benefit Determination, including any denial code, corresponding meaning of such code and a descripti on of the Plan's standard, if any, that was used in denying the claim, and, for a final Adverse Benefit Determination Notice, a discussion of the Plan's decision; Reference to the specific Plan provisions on which the determination is based; A description of any additional material or information necessary for the Claim for Benefits to be approved, modified or reversed, and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; If the denial relates to a claim involving urgent care, a description of the expedited review process applicable to such claim; A description of available internal appeals and external review processes, including information regarding how to initiate an appeal; A statement that any internal rule, guideline, protocol or other similar criteria that was relied on in making the determination is available free of charge upon the Member's request; and 49 If the Adverse Benefit Determination is based on Medical Necessity or experimental treatment or similar exclusion or limit, either a n explanation of the scientific or clinical judgment or a statement that such explanation will be provided free of charge. Information regarding the availability of, and contact information for, any applicable office of health insurance consumer assistance or ombudsman available to assist with internal claims and appeals and external review processes. SECTION 10. APPEALS PROCEDURES The CO -OP Appeals Procedures are available to you in the event you are dissatisfied with some aspect of the Plan administration or you wish to appeal an Adverse Benefit Determination. This procedure does not apply to any problem of misunderstanding or misinformation that can be promptly resolved by the Plan supplying the Member with the appropriate information. Concerns about medical services are best handled at the medical service site level before being brought to the CO -OP. If a Member contacts the CO -OP regarding an issue related to the medical service site and has not attempted to work with the site staff, the Member may be directed to that site to try to solve the problem there, if the issue is not a Claim for Benefits. Certain retroactive terminations of coverage, whether or not there is an adverse effect on any particular benefit at the time are also subject to these procedures. Medical coverage for you and your Dependents will continue pending the outcome of an internal appeal. This means that the Plan will not terminate or reduce any ongoing course of treatment without providing advance notice and the opportunity to review. Please see the Glossary Terms Section herein for a description of the terms used in this section. The following Appe als Procedures will be followed if the medical service site matter cannot be resolved at the site or if the concern involves the Adverse Benefit Determination of a Claim for Benefits. All Appeals will be adjudicated in a manner designed to ensure independe nce and impartiality on the part of the persons making the decision. Informal Review : An Adverse Benefit Determination or medical site service complaint/concern which is directed to the CO-OP Care Department via phone or in person. If an Informal Review is resolved to the satisfaction of the Member, the matter ends. The Informal Review is voluntary. Formal Appeal : An appeal of an Adverse Benefit Determination filed in writing which the CO -OP's Advocacy Department investigates. If a Formal Appeal is resolved to the satisfaction of the Member, the appeal is closed. The Formal Appeal is mandatory if the Member is not satisfied with the initial determination and the Member wishes to appeal such determination. 50 Advocacy Committee : A committee in which the majority of those individuals who are voting members must be members of a CO -OP Health Benefit Plan. CO-OP Care Crew Member : An employee of the CO -OP that is assigned to assist the Member or the Member's Authorized Representative in filing a grievance with the CO -OP or appealing an Adverse Benefit Determination. 10.1 Informal Review A Member who has received an Adverse Benefit Determination of a Claim for Benefits may request an Informal Review. All Informal Reviews must be made to the CO-OP Care Department within 180 days of the Adverse Benefit Determination. Informal Reviews not filed in a timely manner will be deemed waived. The Informal Review is a voluntary level of appeal. Upon the initiation of an Informal Review, a Member must provide CO-OP Care Department with at least the following information: The Member's name (or name of Member and Member's Authorized representative), address, and telephone number; The Member's CO -OP membership number; and A brief statement of the nature of the matter, the reason(s) for th e appeal, and why the Member feels that the Adverse Benefit Determination was wrong.
