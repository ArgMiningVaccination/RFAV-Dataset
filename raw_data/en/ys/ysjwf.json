Serious AEFI Signal and events associated with newly introduced vaccine AEFI that may have been caused by an immunization error Significant events of unexplained cause occurring within 30 days after a vaccination Events causing significant parental or community concern Swelling, redness, soreness at the injection site IF it lasts for more than 3 days or swelling extends beyond nearest joint Adverse event following immunization (AEFI) Vaccine product-related reaction - Extensive limb swelling following DTP vaccination. Vaccine quality defect-related reaction - Failure by the manufacturer to completely inactivate a lot of inactivated polio vaccine leads to cases of paralytic polio Immunization error-related reaction - Transmission of infection by contaminated multidose vial Immunization anxiety-related reaction - Vasovagal syncope in an adolescent during/following vaccination Coincidental event - Example: A fever occurs at the time of the vaccination (temporal association) but is in fact caused by malaria. Types of ADR Very common 10% Common (frequent) 1% and < 10% Uncommon (infrequent) 0.1% and < 1% Rare 0.01% and < 0.1% Very rare < 0.01% Determining causality Difficulties in determining causation between events that are linked in time are common to all drug and vaccine safety monitoring systems. This is particularly challenging in the case of vaccines, because: Information on \"dechallenge and rechallenge\" is usually missing, Vaccines are given to most of the country's birth cohort at an age when coincidental disease are likely, Several vaccines are likely to be administered at the same immunization visit, Vaccine storage, handling, transport and administration must adhere to specific conditions. Any of these, if not done correctly, can result in an adverse event. The possibility of immunization errors therefore must be investigated. Rate of ADR occurrence Observed rate - Total number of cases reported per 1000 vaccinated children - Detect in clinical trial or post licensure vaccine safety Background rate - Not related to vaccine - Occur per 1000 unvaccinated children - Record prior or simultaneously to vaccination Vaccine reaction rate - Related to vaccine - Detected in placebo controlled randomized clinical trial, or passive surveollance or post licensure studies - Observed rate - background rate Other factors to consider when comparing rates of AEFIs Vaccines Manufaturer Age- child vs adloscents Vaccine dose- primary vs booster Case definition- standard Surveillance method- method of surveillance Background condition-background rate of certain events may differ between communities Problem Imagine that rumours begin to circulate about a vaccine when cases of convulsions following immunization occur amongst vaccinated infants. The background rate of convulsions in this population is 1:1,000 infants. The observed rate in vaccinated infants is 1.2:1,000. What is the vaccine attributable rate derived from these figures? - A. 2 additional cases of convulsions in every 1,000 vaccinations, compared with the background rate. - B. 2 additional cases in every 10,000 vaccinations, compared with the background rate. - C. 1.2 additional cases in every 1,000 vaccinations, compared with the background rate. - D. 1.2 additional cases in every 10,000 vaccinations, compared with the background rate. Rotavirus vaccine Pre-licensure literature noted a suspicion of an increased risk of intussusception. After RotaShield\u00ae was licensed for routine use by the public (approximately one million children vaccinated within the first nine months licensure) the American vaccine safety surveillance, Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), began to receive reports of intussusception following administration of the vaccine. About 100 (0.01%) of the one million children vaccinated developed intussusception, 16 a potentially life-threatening bowel obstruction that occurs for unknown reasons in about one child per 10 000, regardless of whether or not they have received a vaccine. Because of the uncertainty about the relationship between RotaShield\u00ae and intussusception cases following vaccination, the manufacturer voluntarily took the product off the market in Risk/benefit assessment Required to strengthen the confidence in immunization programmes. Address the population at risk (not the individual at risk), Take into account contextual issues (economics, availability of alternative vaccines, sociopolitical and cultural factors), Be prompted by a newly identified risk, but must remain holistic (e.g. take into account the entire safety profile of a vaccine, not only the specific information relating to the event that was detected), Run in parallel to active enquiry, cooperation and exchange of information. Problem During a mass measles campaign for 7.5 million children aged from 9 months to 14 years, a 7 year old child developed encephalopathy, convulsions and died. - Should the measles campaign be suspended? - Does the need for action to protect children from possible vaccine related harm in this situation outweigh the need for further investigation, or vice versa? Options for action could include discontinuing the immunization campaign, withdrawing a vaccine batch, and improving staff training and communication. Withdrawing a vaccine lot: - Advantages: reduces fear of vaccine, renews confidence in the vaccine or the campaign, - Disadvantages: cost, potential compromise of the campaign, loss of confidence in vaccine quality. Audit injection practices of health workers to identity sources of immunization errors investigate the need for improved training and education. It is essential to indicate the quality and quantity of any future evidence necessary to trigger reconsideration of the issue, and how the outcomes of any actions will be monitored and assessed. Risk benefit evaluation In the country of Kanindistan, there are 5 million children between the ages of 1-5, and the annual mortality in this age group is 120/100,000. In a mass vaccination campaign, all suitable children between the ages 15 years are to be vaccinated against Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV). Three million children have been vaccinated in the first 2 weeks, during which 140 deaths have been reported following vaccination. In the year before the vaccination campaign the risk of children in the same age range dying of naturally acquired JEV infection was 5.25/100,000. Evaluate this information, to determine whether the risk/benefits of the JEV vaccination campaign outweigh the risks of the disease. Comparing mortality rates of unvaccinated vs. vaccinated children. With 3 million children vaccinated, the expected mortality in this group in a 2 week period is: 3,000,000 x 120/100,000 x 2/52 = 138 The number of deaths (140) is slightly higher than this figure. Comparing the risk of children dying from Japanese Encephalitis (JE) with the excess mortality among vaccinated children. (140 - 138) / 3,000,000 = 1/1,500,000 vaccinated children. The risk of dying from the disease (5.25/100,000) is greater than the excess mortality associated with the vaccination (1/1,500,000). Problem The country of Rubovia has a population of 60 million and the annual incidence of Guillain Barre syndrome is 2/100,000 individuals. In an immunisation campaign, 5 million adults were immunised with an influenza A vaccine. In the 8 weeks following immunisation 26 of them developed Guillain Barre syndrome. Calculate the vaccine attributable rate of Guillain Barre syndrome per 100,000 immunised individuals. The expected incidence of Gullain Barre syndrome in a population of 5million people in an 8 week period is: 5,000,000 x 2/100,000 x 8/52 =16 (15.4) The number observed is 26, therefore the excess is 26 - 16 = 10 The excess incidence is 10/5,000,000 = 0.2/100,000 vaccinated individuals.
