Sustainable progress.6 7 Aditya Birla Capital Limited Sustainability Report 2020-21Chairman's message Assuring continued collective prosperity horizons and stakeholder expectations and, finally, developing sustainable business strategies with timebased targets and annual action plans which are measurable and can be monitored to future proof our businesses. A responsive, responsible organisation The implementation of our sustainability strategy and the embedding of the ESG parameters in our organisation is undergirded by five cardinal principles that we adhere to. The first is transparency and trust, which forms the bedrock of our relationship with our stakeholders. The second principle is responsible resource utilisation, which guides our use of critical resources and leans us towards circularity. The third principle is Zero Harm, which underlines our people culture and safety practices. The fourth is sustainability, which is an integral part of our value creation. And the fifth is collaboration and synergy, which predisposes us towards collaborating with likeminded partners to increase the value for the entire ecosystem. The undergirding by these principles makes us naturally ready to respond to the increasing expectation of greater corporate responsibility from our stakeholders as well as from governments, investors, regulators, and society in general.A landmark year I am happy that we were able to uphold the values and principles we hold dear during the trying circumstances of the year. We were quick to form networks of assistance to help those in need across the country. People engagement, team trust and Group values proved to be the glue for our performance. We delivered a strong performance in FY21 across businesses, leading to the highest ever consolidated profit at Aditya Birla Capital despite the macroeconomic challenges. During the year, we were able to further curb our emissions, reduce the amount of water utilised and waste generated, build a healthy and inclusive workplace for our people and facilitate their growth through development programmes. At the same time, we advanced on our objective of responsibly lending to our portfolio companies, promoting companies that are into renewable energy while continuing to serve communities and offer various financial inclusion products.In conclusion The response to the pandemic across the globe exhibited all that is noble and uplifting in the human spirit. A spirit that was also displayed in our Company's actions and performance during the year. Through this pandemic, our people and systems have been battletested and even better prepared to face any competitive challenge or serious external disruption. The challenges we faced have strengthened the bonds within, opened new vistas of cooperation and convinced our stakeholders that our people deliver - no matter what! That is our best assurance of sustainability and continued collective prosperity. Yours sincerely, \\\\ KUMAR MANGALAM BIRLA ChairmanABG in perspective At ABG, we had grasped its significance close to a decade ago, when I had envisioned the Group becoming a leading Indian conglomerate in sustainable business practices across our global operations. We see sustainability as our 'ability to sustain' and provide leadership with empathy, collaboration, and the ethos of sharing. In our decades of thriving as a business conglomerate across various geographies and sectors, we have amply demonstrated these traits, which have formed the drivers of our success. We started our sustainability journey formally by defining a sustainable business model for ABG businesses based on the three pillars of responsible stewardship, stakeholder engagement and futureproofing. We ensured its proper implementation and set in place an ITglue enabled evidencebased approach and rigorous governance process to guide the selfassessment and verification process.I am happy to note that we have covered formidable ground and have now embarked on the ABG Sustainability Journey 2.0, which is powered by our Business Heads working closely with their Chief Sustainability and Safety Officers and the Group Sustainability team. Through their earnest action, we are accelerating the mainstreaming of ESG in executive and operational decisionmaking. Esg Strategy At ABG While embedding the ESG metrics into our strategies and operations, we consider four dimensions -sectoral uniqueness, geographies of operation, stakeholder expectations across the value chain, and time horizon. This means that we scrupulously map our ESG imperatives according to existing realities in each market and the functioning and demands of each business. This is done by prioritising the material aspects across time Dear Shareholders, The Covid19 pandemic has been a wakeup call for humanity. The exigencies of the pandemic have paved the way for swift changes in mindsets and behaviour. Today, there is far greater consciousness of the interlinkage between human actions and environmental outcomes. Sustainable development, therefore, is a prerequisite for collective prosperity. This heightened awareness is most palpable in the corporate sector, where the pandemic has reinforced the realisation of the importance of delivering financial results in consonance with Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) aspects. Growth along ESG parameters, in fact, is increasingly acknowledged as the best way to embed resilience in business and the hallmark of effective leadership. Having proved its mettle during the pandemic, when ESGleaning companies smoothsailed through the crisis, the ESG factor, I believe, is bound to be seen as a prime growth driver in the days to come.

Inclusive growth. Sustainable progress.8 9 Aditya Birla Capital Limited Sustainability Report 2020-21 Overview by the Chief Executive Officer Generating greater value for all stakeholders Dear Shareholders, I am sure you would all agree that 2021 proved to be another extraordinary year. From 2020, the pandemic has changed our way of life and our outlook towards it. FY21 also brought with it unprecedented challenges and uncertainty as the COVID 19 pandemic continued to evolve, impacting lives and testing our resilience.During times such as these, we, as a business, continued to move ahead with purpose and agility, our actions underpinned by our vision. I am delighted to present to you our third sustainability report, through which we aim to share our sustainability initiatives during the year. Worldwide, ESG integration is gaining immense traction. Incorporating practices that address the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit, ESG integration prepares companies to brace for future challenges, reduce risks, better capitalise on opportunities and deliver sustainable returns. India is seeing a new momentum on ESG disclosures by companies. The Indian government has also formulated the new Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR), which requires companies to inculcate sustainable practices across their business operations. Driving greater ESG integration The Aditya Birla Group already has an intense focus on ESG, with our Chairman, Mr. Kumar Mangalam Birla, proactively weaving sustainable business practices across all the Group's operations. We have adopted global best practices that help us impact the lives of our stakeholders in the most sustainable way. We are building a responsible and inclusive business portfolio by financing green projects, ensuring the well being of our employees and contributing to society, while addressing global issues such as climate change, weighing each business decision through the ESG perspective. This year, we stepped up the ante with the following decisions: Launching an ESG focussed equity fund through Aditya Birla SunLife Asset Management Company (ABSLAMC) Driving our retail and inclusion agenda by providing finance investments and insurance protection solutions to the unbanked and under penetrated population Sustaining our commitment and focus towards financing renewable energy projects In the past eight years, we have provided more than M 7,000 Crore to finance solar and wind energy projects with our renewable energy portfolio touching 2,196 MW in FY21. This year, we also provided M 75 Crore funds for electric vehicles projects. At the same time, we have deepened We are continually striving to create a happy workspace for our people, investing in upgrading their skills, and ensuring that we have a diverse and inclusive team which works together. 27% of our workforce is represented by women employees while we have employed 41 differently abled people. Our employees are given the opportunity to share their workplace experience through a survey on the basis of which we set up an action plan for the areas where we have the opportunity to improve. It makes me happy to state that this year, our survey generated a 85% engagement score, which is 6% higher than the global highperformance norm. For us, our people are our biggest asset. During the year, our topmost priority was to safeguard our people and help them and their families get access to COVID 19 vaccines. We conducted various vaccination drives to ensure they were safe while ensuring their mental well being through interactive counselling sessions with experts. We remain cognisant of our societal responsibility. Through our CSR initiatives focused on healthcare, education, sports, skill development and women empowerment, we have touched multiple lives and created opportunities for the underserved communities. During FY21, our CSR funding was M 38.24 Crore through which we supported multiple causes, compared to M 34.71 Crore in FY20. We have extended education support and scholarships to various child resource centres and schools in Uttar Pradesh and the NCR region while continuously striving to improve access to affordable healthcare through our cancer care and maternal care initiatives. Our CSR outreach also focuses on upskilling, be it by spreading awareness on sustainable agriculture that benefit among farmers or empowering women through SHGs that help in capacity building that enables them to generate sustainable livelihood. Our recent intervention, the 'Pradan' project is addressing various developmental challenges across certain districts of Madhya Pradesh that will help women attain higher income levels to support their families and emerge out of poverty. These CSR programmes have collectively impacted over 2.56 lakh lives. Simultaneously, we are also promoting young talent through sports. We supported six athletes, who secured a place in the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. Our consistent environmental stewardship has ensured that we minimise our impact on the environment and create ways for its regeneration. We are in the process of recycling sanitary waste and are using biodegradable garbage bags across our offices. We have tied up with Via Green to manage our waste and recycling initiatives in a scientific and sustainable manner through which we avoided generating 5,183 kg of dry waste and 16.2 MTCO 2 carbon emissions. This year, we reduced our carbon emissions by 30% Y oY and we intend to increase our use of renewable energy. We are also minimising our energy usage, increasing energy efficiency through solar panel installations which helps us save significant electricity consumption costs. I am sure the coming years will see us report even greater success in minimising our carbon footprint. Performing consistently The tough times impacted the entire banking and financial services industry, but our robust diversified business model ensured that we were able to deliver consistent results during the year. Our revenue grew 14% Y oY to M 20,447 Crore, and net profit increased 22% Y oY to an all time high of M 1,127 Crore. We continue to address our challenges with agility and undertake initiatives that ensure employee wellbeing, health and safety, and technology readiness that ensure greater customer engagement and business resilience.Expanding digital avenues Although we had already been going full thrust on our digital transformation, the pandemic lent an added impetus to this journey. During FY21, we stepped up our progression towards digital. We reengineered ways in which customers are onboarded and changed the way we engage with them by developing several digital platforms and facilitating WhatsApp interactions. By adopting these digital channels, we have been able to enhance our customer experience, give them valuable insights and guide them along their financial journey. Our digital transformation has also helped us upscale our internal business processes and platforms and reduce the overall use of paper. Looking ahead We are a well diversified company with a robust value creation model. With a strong workforce and unparalleled reach across both rural and urban areas, we are positioned to steadily grow over the coming years. We have always supported the dreams and aspirations of people to lead a better and more fulfilling life through our financial solutions. By making our products more accessible, needspecific and robust, we hope to promote greater financial inclusion and thus to contribute to more broad based, sustainable social progress. I take this opportunity to sincerely thank our team and all our stakeholders for their continued faith in us. Yours sincerely, AJAY SRINIVASAN Chief Executive Officerour focus on our inclusion agenda by increasing our exposure in smaller cities and deepening our presence in semi urban and rural areas through affordable insurance penetration, affordable housing loans, popularising micro SIPs, and providing personal loans. As part of our SME lending, we have also offered supply chain financing solutions to small suppliers/Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). During the year our SME loan advances stood at M 12,779 Crore while the affordable housing segment garnered over 10,000 unique customers. Our affordable housing loan book has grown 2x over the last two years and is projected to grow much faster in the near future. Through the help of our ESG scorecards we are also looking forward to fulfil new loans across different sectors. Promoting inclusive goals We believe that a business can survive and remain viable in the long term only if it earns the support of all its stakeholders by generating value for them.

Sustainable progress.18 19 Aditya Birla Capital Limited Sustainability Report 2020-21Innovation Curating solutions. Driving scale. The customer remains at the core of our digital transformation. We are focusing on four key areas - customer acquisition, customer selfservice, customer value and building scalability in processes and systems. This ensured that even during the difficulties created by the pandemic, we were able to leverage our digital channels to address customer concerns and deliver smooth customer experiences.Customer selfservice Promoting selfservice channels Selfservice channels like voice bots, WhatsApp chatting, chatbots, apps and customer service portals improve customer engagement significantly. We now have over 90% services on digital selfservice channels. Our customer engagement performance is measured in terms of the number of customer interactions per annum. On our digital channels, this has gone up by 50% from 1.8 to 2.7 between FY20 and FY21, as opposed to our traditional channels, where the figure dipped by 0.1 in FY21 over previous year. For the past two years, we have been working towards simplifying Straight Through Processing (STP) journeys for customer onboarding and service, which will significantly cut down on TAT and improve customer experience. Almost 50% of our service journeys are endtoend STP. Leveraging voice technology We are one of the early adopters of voice technology in the industry and have built over 100 voice bots catering to customer onboarding, service, and renewal journeys. We are building inbound IVR bots to address customer queries and ensure 24X7 service. The audiovisual bots can begin the conversation with customers and then guide them on a visual interface to complete the service interaction on call. Voice bots were used for digital collections and moratorium calling in Aditya Birla Finance Limited and Aditya Birla Housing Finance Limited.Customer value Hyperpersonalisation We are using an AI/ML model to identify the genome of the customer, and using that insight to hyper personalise the next best conversation to be sent to customer on digital channels. These messages have led to 2x jump in customer click rates and conversions. We are leveraging the data of existing customers to create preapproved products and increase customer product holding by amplifying crosssell and upsell. In our life insurance business, 17% of first year premium was through PreApproved Sum Assured products (PASA). Similarly, in MF, M6,000+ Crore gross sales is incurred through next best offer to customers. Omnichannel orchestration of customer journeys: Through this initiative, we are moving towards intuitive and efficient self services for our customers across physical and digital channels. Shifting to proactive service, we are making personalised offers based on the customer's profile, where customer does not need to reach out to us for service or recommendations for financial products. Our omnichannel orchestration has allowed us to connect physical and digital service channels seamlessly. Customers can start a payment journey, and if the journey is broken can continue it via WhatsApp. From address change and nominee addition, the customer gets proactive service requests across all channels regularly for over 180 service journeys across our businesses. 1 Million+ Views by customers for proactive omnichannel communication in FY21We made outbound calls to customers and collected over M300 Crore in renewal premium, with 20% collection happening over weekends when traditional contact centres are closed. We are using voice biometrics for customer authentication and speech analytics perceive sentiments and improve customer NPS at our contact centres. 2.5 Million+ Customers connected through voice bots in FY21Customer acquisition Ecosystems and partnerships In our Health Insurance, Mutual Fund (MF), Lending and Life Insurance businesses, we have leveraged technology for seamless integration into ecosystem partner journeys for customer acquisition at scale. Our health insurance business offers sachet products supported with simplified digital journeys, which have led to 1 Lakh+ policies per day through our ecosystem partners. In our MF business, 60% of purchase transactions by volume are through ecosystem partners. We have also acquired 1 Million+ customers through BNPL (Buy Now Pay Later) product in our lending business. We have analyticsbased models for instant decisioning, India Stack APIs for customer verification and KYC, among others, together with contextual products with a 34 step simplified digital journey for frictionless customer onboarding.Digital onboarding capabilities We have built significant digital onboarding capabilities across lines of business (LOBs) through endtoend customer journey reengineering. This has ensured in business sustainability during the pandemic. Over 84% of our customers were onboarded digitally across all LOBs in FY21, which helped in contactless customer acquisition, and reduced TAT and cost of acquisition by 3060 %. New digital journeys launched include contactless digital MF and personal loan journey with video KYC, assisted digital onboarding journey for housing loans, a fiveminute digital onboarding journey for opening a stock broking account, life insurance onboarding journey with CKYC for per population of form and Insta Preinsurance Verification Calls (PIVC).Leveraging of new technologies New technologies for standardisation of partners for digital customer onboarding journeys include recognition, eSign and eContract among others. This has resulted in significant reduction in cost and time incurred in deploying the solutions. We have received digital renewal journeys on WhatsApp, web, app, audio visual bot across Housing Insurance, Life Insurance and Motor Insurance.

We implemented a hybrid cloud strategy for infrastructure resilience and 87% of the apps are available on a public and private cloud. We have moved the key customer facing app to the public cloud for high availability. We have also migrated around 17% of the infrastructure from the private to public cloud and have successfully migrated to cloud telephony system for all LOBs for inbound and outbound calls (36 units) to ensure greater agility. This is the first implementation in Indian BFSI sector. We have a clear roadmap for modernisation of our technology stack, including frontend assets, middleware and core systems. Midoffice and back office automation is being undertaken rapidly. We implemented over 440 RPAs across all LOB operations, customer service, finance and HR functions.

NPS is administered both in a topdown and bottomup approach. Bottomup NPS is deployed via digital means to understand customer behaviour on an online platform. Topdown NPS is a key market evaluation tool, which helps us understand where we stand against our competitors.Bottomup NPS While we have been tracking NPS for our macro journeys, currently we have begun gathering NPS data for micro journeys as well, across all key touchpoints. This has enabled us to attain actionable insights and assist businesses in reengineering journeys that have encountered a lower NPS score and higher traffic. We have introduced a common, live digital NPS dashboard, which gives our team the advantage of gaining real time data and insights.

Read more on page 20Deeper financial inclusion Countries with greater financial inclusion or access to affordable, appropriate financial services, have reported stronger GDP growth rates and lower income inequality. In India, financial inclusion has been on the rise, partly thanks to the government's own push such as the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), which is believed to have led to an 80% rise in the number of adults with bank accounts (Global Findex 2017 Report). The rise of digital means of payment and other services have led to greater access. This could lead to reduction in existing social and economic inequalities as the more the people have recourse to options in education and livelihood the faster they can move towards achieving financial stability. At ABC, we are playing our part in accelerating this movement through our wide range of services such as affordable housing, microSIPs, rural insurance, SME lending and financial literacy among others, fostering financial inclusion and reaching out to India's hinterlands to deliver our services.

The Government of India is pushing for 'Housing for all', including the lowincome segment through the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana - Urban (PMAYU). To bridge the stark demandsupply gap, the government is providing subsidies to further promote affordable housing.In 2021, it extended additional tax benefit of M1.5 Lakh on interest paid on affordable housing loans by one year till March 2022, similar to what it had done the previous year. Through Aditya Birla Housing Finance Limited (ABHFL), we offer a comprehensive range of housing finance solutions for both salaried and selfemployed individuals. We also extend financing to developers of affordable housing projects. We have built strong momentum in affordable housing segment, with targeted book mix of 3540% by March 2022.

This option is made available in select longterm plans and for firsttime investments as well, such as Micro SIPs. We have also reduced the minimum investment amount in Aditya Birla Sun Life (ABSL) Liquid fund to M500 from M1,000. The objective of Micro SIPs is to reduce the entry level barriers most customers face, especially in Tier III and IV cities, where household income leaves limited headroom for savings. These schemes also give an opportunity to the disadvantaged sections of society to achieve financial independence through MFs. These are largely utilised by the digitalfocused players like GROWW, ET Money and PayTM Money, with 2025% of their initial purchase transactions falling under the purchase band of M100500. ABSLAMC has strengthened its distribution mix with presence across 284 locations and over 75% of its locations in B30 cities. To increase its reach, ABSLAMC has tieups with ~100 banks. It has empanelled over 87,000 Independent Financial Advisors (IFAs) and over 240 national distributors, besides growing partnerships with a large digital ecosystem. This step has contributed to expanding reach and access to various investment options in smaller cities, which has increased our outreach across semiurban and rural areas. According to CRISIL research the share of financial assets as a proportion of net household savings is expected to increase over the next five years. This rise will further boost investments under MFs. Given the increasing significance of leveraging technology in AMCs, ABSLAMC has many digital assets, positioning it as one the leaders in the market.

Recently there has been a rise in financial literacy due to increased mobile penetration, awareness,and government schemes, which are helping bring more people under formal banking. With rise in formal banking, there is a demand for financial products and services especially in the semiurban and rural areas.

As part of the Group, we have signed the WASH pledge (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) and implemented it across our workplace to ensure that all our employees have access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene at the workplace. We have also retrofitted water saving devices at all our office washrooms and pantry areas, thereby reducing water usage by 50%.Environmental responsibility is built into our sustainability strategy, through which we ensure sustainable practices across our operations. This strengthens our focus on the longterm well being of our employees, customers and the community at large. Through proper water, waste and energy management, we ensure that we are able to reduce our environmental footprint and minimise the use of natural resources. Innovation at the workplace: Auto Power Generated and Conserved System (APGC) APGC has been installed in office urinals, replacing old batterypowered sensors. Through this initiative, the power required to operate an automatic urinal flushing system is auto generated by the flushing system itself. The disbanding of batterypowered sensors is helping us cut down on heavy battery consumption as well as electric power consumption. APGC conserves power through an advanced microchip technology that enables 24x7 continuous and steady power supply for the system to function. This helps save both water and power for the touchfree and hygienic urinals. We are in the process of obtaining green certification for the system.

Of this number, 15,950 women were part of an intensive farmbased livelihood programme. By the end of FY21, 13,216 women and their families secured 100% food security by various farm and nonfarm interventions. Among them, 6,160 women have achieved yearround food security through their own cultivation, in addition to having an average annual income of M77,947*. SportsTargeted change process: *The average baseline income before project was M30,970The Dindori and Mandla districts of Madhya Pradesh are primarily rainfed areas. The average productivity of all the crops is in the range of onethird to onefifth of the national average. The districts, in general, receive an average annual rainfall of 1,200 mm but most of the rainwater is lost because of erosion, given the topography of the area. Women of the region also face issues such as social exclusion, and have to live with poverty and food scarcity. Although agriculture is the key source of livelihood in the region, ABC, in association with our implementation partner PRADAN, We are improving access to affordable healthcare through our various initiatives, including the strengthening of the healthcare ecosystem in rural areas. In an extensive programme for maternal care and childcare, we developed a model that addresses nutrition needs, including midcourse meals. We are also focusing on prenatal, postnatal, immunisation and nutritional support for mother and child. This programme spans Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan. One of the most crucial issues in sustainability is to achieve water positivity, or putting more water back into the environment than what is used in our areas of operation. This is one of the major aims of our water management policy. We have helped create 5.4 Lakh cubic meters of water harvesting potential by constructing 131 water harvesting structures in Rajasthan. Sustainable livelihood and agriculture are also our core focus areas. Through various farmbased interventions and training programmes, we are spreading knowledge about New knowledgeIncome gainsAsset augmentationImproved market accessPractice adoptionProductivity gainsSocial mobilizationFood sufficiency 6 Athletes supported by ABC have secured a place in the Tokyo Olympics 2021launched a project involving three blocks of MP for sustainable livelihood intervention.
