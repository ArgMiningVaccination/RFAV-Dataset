Based on the Cartesian system, it is a brake on the development of human sciences in general and well - being in particular. It ignores life, which is energyTHANK YOU MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE Thank you for talking about the natural approach, prevention and cure of COVID -19 If we refer to nature and to Africa, it is because: Conventional medicine has shown its limits African medicine remains the hope for the health & well -being of our humanity You know in the 17thcentury, with the discovery of bacteria as a pathogen, the prescription in those days was to kill the bacteria It was the advent of antibiotics.

A small study of 62 patients from Senegal living with AIDS (1999) was given only herbal therapy for 6 months in a research center in Fatick, Senegal. After 6 months of treatment, viral loads went down and T cell counts went up. After more than 15 years without treatment and therapy, the blood of the patients is free of virus How can short -term treatment cause a long -term suppression of virus? 0 1 2 3 4 5 60100000200000300000400000500000 180 MonthsM ean Viral LoadViral LoadWhat we saw... Un-treated control The extracts continue to have an effect even after removed from the virusHow it works... The collaborative research show that the protein from the plant is responsible for this activity. These antibodies suppress the virus long- term and keep virus at undetectable levels.How it works... After 15 years the patient's serum can inhibit HIV 100% Patient's Serum THE FUTURE OF THE SOLUTION OF THE CORONAVIRUS DEPENDS ON THIS TYPE OF COLLABORATIVE RESEARCHUnlimited Possibilities This research is progressing to the development and commercialization of a natural HIV medication (pharmaceutical and nutraceutical products) -first of many Possibility that this product may also be a vaccine candidate Possible development of therapies for other viral diseases such as Ebola, hepatitis, Zika, herpes and influenza PROMETRA has plant based treatments for many other human pathologies Commercial benefit to MSM, NPRC & PROMETRA MSM developing a NPRC business arm to produce, manufacture and distribute a line of nutraceuticals NPRC becomes the industry leader in the characterization and validation of natural product for national and international customersWe can no longer ignore, disrespect or underutilize African healers We must recognize the role they can and must play in achieving global health equity for all The price of failure is too greatThe time to act is nowThank you PROMETRA International Cit\u00e9 Facebook @PROMETRA1971 GLOBAL HEALTH EQUITY LECTURE SERIES: NATURAL HEALING APPROACHES TO COVID -19 NATURAL HEALING APPROACHES TO COVID -19 FrAnselm Medicine Medicine OBJECTIVES MEDICINE ISTO PREVENT DISEASESMODERN ORANCIENT? \"All medicine is modern in so far as it is satisfactorily directed towards the common goal of providing health care, despite the setting in time, place and culture\". -World Health Organization (1977)PRINCIPLES OFAFRICAN HERBAL getinto thebody. immunity isweak. 4.When 3.VIRUSES 4.PARASITESNATURAL MEDICINE SEES LIFE ASNOT JUST ABOUT WELL.PAXHERBALS AND COVID BOOSTER AND ANTI -INFECTIVE.
