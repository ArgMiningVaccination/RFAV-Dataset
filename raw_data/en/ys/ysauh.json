The prerequisite for gaining complete education, complete knowledge - the prerequisite for knowing everything, experiencing everything, and doing everything - is to bring the awareness to the level of pure intelligence, pure knowledge, self-referral intelligence, self-referral consciousness, Transcendental Consciousness.\" - Maharishi Mahesh Y ogi In this past year, our University has made tremendous progress across an impressive range of new initia - tives - even as many more tantalizing opportunities are quickly unfolding before us. This 2016 - 2017 Universi-ty Report provides a quick overview of these latest inspiring achievements and emerging opportunities. As you will see, our University's core mission, deep values, and significance to the world were brilliantly summa - rized by our 2017 Commencement speaker, Congressman Tim Ryan, who truly gave a speech for the ages. Our University's most innovative academic programs - our Regenerative Organic Agriculture program, our Masters in Maharishi AyurV eda and Integrative Medicine, and our Hawaii Sustainabil- ity courses - have been hugely popular and have won significant acclaim. Our valiant trustees are spearheading cru-cial initiatives in all areas of University life, and our alumni are winning nota - ble awards and transforming society for the better - both locally and global-ly. And our brilliant students continue to win top honors against renowned competitors in science, arts, and athlet-ics, demonstrating the power of Con-sciousness-Based education in devel- oping the full potential of life. But all these accomplishments are just the beginning. Even though last year we graduated (and thereby lost) a record number of students, by Fall 2017, we had over 1,700 students en- rolled at the University. W e are now launching an online B.A. in Liberal Arts aimed at the hundreds of thou-sands of students nationally who are planning to complete their college de - grees. This summer we expect to build a 1+ megawatt solar array with state-of-the-art technology that will provide one-third of our campus's electrical needs. W e are substantially renovating and upgrading our campus, including the Argiro Student Center, the Arts Center, the Library, the Visitors Cen-ter, and historic Henn Mansion, as well as key student dormitories to accom-modate our rising enrollments. All these achievements are driven by the extraordinary dedication, hard work, and guiding intelligence of every-one associated with our incredible in-stitution - and especially our visionary and generous donors. W e have so many opportunities for progress and expan - sion that are ripe for the plucking! W e only need to work together as a family, and to commit our collective focus and resources to realizing the potential that lies before us. I look forward to working with you to accomplish all these inspiring goals in this coming year.CAMPUS NEWS 4 | Program in regenerative organ- ic agriculture launches 6 | President Hagelin leads peace summit in Ukraine 7 | Students learn sustainability in Hawaii 7 | New screenwriting program off to strong start 8 | Sustainable Living Center extraordinarily energy efficient Campus improvements 8 | Outdoor amphitheater constructed 9 | Over 175 trees planted 9 | Men's dormitories renovated 9 | Affordable townhomes built near campus ACHIEVEMENTS 28 | Faculty achievements 32 | Student achievements 36 | Maharishi School achievements INSTITUTIONAL ADVANCEMENT 40 | Our supporters 56 | Legacy giving opportunitiesFEATURES 10 | U.S. Congressman Tim Ryan delivers commencement address \"We need leaders who are established in that un- derlying unity of life\" 14 | Alumna Anna Bruen helps clean up Iowa's abandoned coal mines Dedicated to improving lives in southeastern Iowa 18 | MUM trustees pitch in on all areas of campus life From overseeing renovation to raising funds for the endowment 24 | Enrollment surges in online master's degree programs Offering degrees in Maharishi Vedic Science and in Maharishi AyurVeda UNIVERSITY REPORT 2016-2017 | 5 4 | MAHARISHI UNIVERSITY OF MANAGEMENTCAMPUS NEWS Professor Appachanda Thimmaiah is passionate about agriculture, but not just any kind. He preaches, and lives, \"regenerative organic agriculture. \" The aim of Dr. Thimmaiah's new program is to create self-sufficient farming systems where all the inputs, such as seeds, manures, and bio-pesticides, are produced on the farm itself. And in his typically charismatic fash- ion, Dr. Thimmaiah attracts others with his vision, launching a new nine- month certificate program in regener - ative organic agriculture in January of 2017 and enrolling a dozen students. The students begin with a course on culturing the intelligence of nature, which linked Maharishi's knowledge with agriculture. That's followed by courses on farming practices, organic agriculture, and soil science. Then they spend six months in the field. Selling produce at farmers market The first cohort began their field work by starting seeds in the greenhouses, then planted their crops. By May they had begun selling the fruits of their harvest at the Fairfield Farmers Mar - ket and Everybody's Caf\u00e9. Their pro - duce included salad greens, radishes, kale, chard, peas, zucchini, tomatoes, beans, sweet corn, carrots, and melon. The farm is located on 24 acres of land immediately north of the grain elevator that borders campus. A 4,800-square-foot building on the site was completely renovated and is used for cleaning and storing vegetables, as well as storing equipment. Other amenities include lockers, a changing area, bathrooms, and showers. A loft area includes a small library of books on agriculture and also serves as a cur - ing area for garlic, onions, and squash. In addition, construction of the new Petra Stanley Regenerative Organic Agriculture Center that will house a conference room, classrooms, and of-fice space was expected to begin in the latter part of 2017. The first of its kind in the country, this new program is a collaborative effort among five internationally re - nowned organizations in the field of organic and biodynamic agriculture. In addition to the certificate program, MUM's Department of Sustainable Living began offering a bachelor's de - gree in regenerative organic agriculture in the fall of 2017. Learning both farming and business practices \"W e learn the practical experience of farming, and then, with the farmers market, the business aspect as well,\" said student Mike Dwyer. \"It's a really good program. Y ou don't get this full experience elsewhere.\" Students have tilled the ground, made rows and raised beds, aerated the soil, and learned to make and ap - ply compost and compost tea, as well as organic garlic-based pest repellent. They also have learned how to irrigate, weed properly, and put up trellises. In addition to the various growing tech- niques, students also engage in team building and farm management prac-tices. \"W e're always working as a team and communicating about what we need to do,\" said Theodore Sanler. The students come from diverse backgrounds and their career plans are just as diverse. They aspire to become farm managers, establish their own farms, write books, educate veterans about sustainable agriculture, and get into urban gardening. \"The purpose of this course is to create an army of future farmers who can redesign and restructure the cur - rent food and agriculture systems,\" Dr. Thimmaiah said. \"Graduates of this program will have confidence to farm or start their own business in regener - ative organic agriculture.\" For more information, see www. mum.edu/roa-certificate. This is agriculture that enriches the soil rath- er than depleting it, that sequesters carbon from the air rather than contributing to global warming, that ensures the purest and healthiest vegetables, and that is in tune with the laws of nature.

Why Hawaii? The Big Island is home to many sustainable farmers and homesteaders, intention- al communities, and craftsmen, as well as native Hawaiians who are maintaining their ancient cul- ture. Thanks to the many connections Professor Lonnie Gamble has made on the Big Island, the students spend much of their time learning from these local specialists and doing service work in their enterprises. Student Danny Flynn, for example, spent a week at the Hawaii Institute of Pacific Agriculture, a sustainable farming operation that focuses on living off the land and growing food that's nu-tritious, safe, and good for the environment. He helped with composting, mulching, planting, and transplanting, as well as with their beehive, dairy, and agro-forestry operations. Hawaii is also an ideal setting for studying sus- tainability because the islands are geographically remote. Issues residents face include soil fertility, energy, transportation, urban planning, employ - ment, inequality, and access to fresh water. This new program, which is hosted at the Ko - hala Institute, is designed as a semester abroad, during which MUM students and students from other universities engage in an intensive explo - ration of sustainability, transformative leadership, and consciousness. The 2016-17 modules includ- ed sustainability and the dilemmas of the 21st century; sustainability and Ha-waiian studies; technology and de - sign for sustainable living; and team projects. (See current offerings at www.mum.edu/hawaii.) The Kohala Institute is located on 2,500 acres on the large - ly rural Big Island, which has just 150,000 residents. A major summit in Ukraine in June entitled \"Science and Peace: Proven Solutions to Violence and Global Con - flict\" brought together leaders from 21 countries to hear about science-based approaches to peace. The conference, hosted by the Global Union of Sci- entists for Peace and attended by 600 people, was led by MUM President John Hagelin, who is also the interna - tional president of that organization. The audience represented the top tier of Ukrainian scientific, academic, military, and governmental leadership. They had been invited primarily by Ukrainian leaders Lt. General V asyl Krutov, former chief of the Ukraine Anti-T errorism Center, and Dr. Sergiy Maksymenko, the country's most re - nowned research scientist, both of whom are leaders of the Global Union and enthusiastic about bringing the benefits of the Transcendental Medi-tation technique to Ukraine. Brain-based approach to peace Among the solutions discussed, there was widespread support for the \"Brain-Based Approach to Peace\" of- fered by Dr. Hagelin, Fred Travis, Da - vid Orme-Johnson, Sandy Nidich, and others. Dr. Travis described how stress shuts down the prefrontal cortex, the \"higher violent, fear-driven behavior. \"If these tensions grow unchecked - if they reach a boiling point - they inevitably erupt in social violence, terrorism, and war,\" said Dr. Hage - lin. \"T o prevent such violence, we need to defuse societal stress and re - store balanced brain functioning.\" Dr. Orme-Johnson presented extensive research showing how the Transcen-dental Meditation\u00ae technique restores balanced functioning in the brain and in society, and Dr. Nidich reported on the positive outcomes of a recent study on TM\u00ae and PTSD that was funded by the U.S. Department of Defense. Implemented in 22 countries in Latin America This Brain-Based Approach to Peace received strong support among the conference participants, resulting in the unanimous adoption of a resolu- tion calling for its implementation. Heads of state and other top govern-ment leaders presented striking exam-ples of how this approach put an end to decades of civil war and brought lasting societal peace and prosperity. In Latin America, 22 countries have implemented this approach within the public educational system and in the training of their armies and militias. Army generals in Ecuador and Bra - zil gave reports about how peace was achieved in their countries after pro - tracted civil war. Among the presenters was Joachim Chissano, former president of Mo - zambique, who spoke via prerecorded video. He described how he applied Maharishi's Brain-Based Approach and credited it with ending his nation's 20 years of civil war and bringing peace and prosperity. Father Gabriel Mejia of Colombia spoke via Skype about how teaching the Transcendental Meditation and TM-Sidhi\u00ae programs to tens of thou-sands of orphaned children in Bogota created a \"wave of peace\" in Colombia that helped end 52 years of civil war. Thirty-eight separate news organi- zations covered the conference, includ-ing eight national Ukrainian television stations, 19 social-political news agen-cies, and numerous international news agencies. Students in the two-year program do their coursework online and come to campus at the beginning of each se - mester for a 10-day residency. Film director Peter Farrelly was on hand to give guest presentations during the students' inaugural residen-cy, filmmaker David Lynch connected via Skype for 45 minutes to answer questions from each student, and in- ternational script consultant Dara Marks gave lectures on transforma - tional narrative. The students learned the Transcen- dental Meditation technique early in their residency, and heard from Professor Fred Travis how it changes the brain and fosters greater creativ - ity. Mr. Farrelly spoke about his films and about how learning the Transcendental Meditation tech-nique in recent years has affected his work. Along with his brother Bobby Farrelly, he is best known as the creator of such films as \"There's Something Myself & Irene,\" among other successes. In addition to the online lectures and residencies, the students also con-nect weekly with a mentor, as well as meeting online as a group once a week. W orkshops, in which they read and comment on each other's work, are also an important component. For more information, email drom- palske@mum.edu.

The renovations included painting the exterior trim, repairing entryways to three of the buildings, and sandblast cleaning of the brick exterior on all five buildings. Renovation of the lobbies included painting, new carpet, remod - eling, and new furniture. The heating and air conditioning systems were also upgraded. These renovations have helped trans- form the appearance and feeling of these residence halls, while improving their energy efficiency and overall utility. The next phase will involve renovation of student rooms.Thanks to grants of $5,000 and $10,000, and the efforts of volunteers, over 175 trees were planted during the 2016-17 academic year. Locations in- cluded the sloping land west of the W omen's Dome, areas around Crow Creek and the Punj T ennis Center, and along two of the main roads lead-ing into campus: Badgett Drive and Zimmerman Boulevard. The planting was guided by rep - resentatives from Trees Forever and organized by the Green Iowa Ameri-Corps volunteers being hosted on campus. The varieties of trees planted included oak, linden, locust, catalpa, birch, lilacs, tulip trees, redbud, white pines, London planetrees (a sycamore hybrid), and disease-resistant elms. In addition, MUM trustee T oby Lieb has spearheaded a major initia - tive to improve the arched bridge area as well as the immediate environment surrounding the walkway that crosses Crow Creek on central campus. Ex-tensive brush was removed, the creek was cleared of wood debris, trees were planted, and landscaping was done alongside the arched bridge, including perennials and bushes. The Japanese footbridge was also restored.Over 175 trees planted Renovation of buildings continuesNEW CAMPUS CONSTRUCTIONLow-cost townhomes built in North Campus Village Low-cost options for those interest- ed in moving to Fairfield increased in the past year, with the addition of over 20 Maharishi V astu\u00ae townhomes in North Campus Village and over 30 planned units that are in the process of being constructed. Because of government grants and tax incentives, the price has typically been in the range of $100,000 for a 1-bedroom, 1-bathroom home that's part of a duplex, to $127,500 for a 2-bedroom, 1.5-bathroom, two-story townhome in a triplex. All of the 56 units in this new phase of development have been sold, with the remaining units expected to be finished in the next year and a half. Because of the strong demand, the developers now have tentative plans to begin another development of low-cost homes. Those interested can be put on a waiting list. Email mbrett@ vastupartners.com. Other new housing opportunities in the community include the renovated campus in Maharishi V edic City that once housed over 1,100 V edic pandits and now provides affordable accom- modations for those who want to be a part of the Invincible America Assem-bly. The two-bedroom cottages range from $250 to $600 per month, plus utilities, while two-room suites with private bath and shared kitchen/laun- dry facilities are $360 per month, in-cluding utilities and free Internet. The price for couples is $420 per month. See https://sites.google.com/view/idealifeassembly. Because of its outstanding energy-sav - ing performance, MUM's Sustainable Living Center caught the attention of an organization called Getting to Net Zero, which keeps track of ultra-effi-cient buildings and their energy usage. According to their calculations, the building's net Energy Use Intensity was -0.5 in 2015, indicating that the building produced 5 percent more en- ergy than it used. Net EUI is a measure of energy use per square foot per year minus renewable energy production. They said that the Sustainable Living Center is among the highest-perform-ing buildings they had encountered, especially given Iowa's harsh climate. The year 2015 was the only one for which consistent data tracking was available, but according to estimates, the building was even more efficient in previous years, producing as much as 30 percent more energy than it used. The building's electricity comes from two sources: solar photovoltaic panels and a wind turbine. The heating is provided by solar hot water heaters. Heating and cooling are supplemented by geothermal tubing. The building feeds its excess electricity back into the MUM grid for use by other buildings. The Schwartz-Guich Sustainable Living Center, completed in 2012, in- cludes classrooms, offices, labs, and a workshop. Other features include earth block walls for thermal mass, daylighting, and an exterior south wall that's a greenhouse for passive solar heating.MUM Sustainable Living Center outperforms expectations Younger Park - Olson Family Amphitheater The next step in the transformation of campus began in the summer of 2017 with the construction of an amphi - theater on the sloping land east of the Argiro Student Center that seats over 100 people. The Olson Family Amphitheater, funded by Peggy Olson and her late husband Marty, includes tiered seat- ing made of brick, and a stage. Both fi- ber optic cable and cable TV were also installed. The amphitheater is the first phase of the development of Y ounger Park, which will eventually expand to include additional features.Construction of Y ounger Park beginsFEATURES 10 | MAHARISHI UNIVERSITY OF MANAGEMENTU.S. CONGRESSMAN Congressman Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) is a man of courage. Courage to be open about his practice of meditation. Courage to invite his colleagues on Capitol Hill to participate in his twice-weekly \"Quiet Time Caucus. \" Courage to travel to Iowa to an unusual university and deliver the commencement address. And courage to unstintingly praise that university's unique approach to education. Not surprisingly, a main theme of his address was courage. And it was an address that delighted and inspired the record 579 graduating students at the 2017 Maharishi Uni-versity of Management commencement. COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS DELIGHTS RECORD GRADUATING CLASS UNIVERSITY REPORT 2016-2017 | 11TIM RYAN'SUNIVERSITY REPORT 2016-2017 | 13 12 | MAHARISHI UNIVERSITY OF MANAGEMENTFEATURES Congressman Tim Ryan Congressman Ryan has been the U.S. Representative for Ohio's 13th congressional district since 2003, having been reelected seven times. He previously served in the Ohio Senate. He is a leading voice for promoting college affordability, expanding renewable energy, and enhancing access to healthcare. His focus on health includes being an active proponent of the benefits of meditation. He has organized twice-weekly meditation sessions for staff and mem-bers of Congress, which he calls the \"Quiet Time Caucus. \" In addition, he is working to make integrative health techniques, including Transcendental Meditation, more accessible to all veterans through funding from the Veterans Administration. Congressman Ryan's published books include The Real Food Revolution: Healthy Eating, Green Groceries, and the Return of the American Family. He strongly promotes healthy food and agri- cultural practices. Deep appreciation for mission of MUM Congressman Ryan began his talk by expressing his deep appreciation for the mission of Maharishi University of Management. \"Everywhere I travel I see the out- reach of this great university: Tran- scendental Meditation - the medita - tion you practice, the meditation you research, the meditation you teach - is now being offered in big companies and small family-owned businesses, hospitals and clinics, tough inner-city schools and military bases, in prisons and homeless shelters. \"It's clear from the research that Transcendental Meditation is helping to unlock the limitless potential of the human mind. It is an essential tool that can immeasurably enrich our lives and help us take on intractable ills like prej - udice, violence and addiction. \"Y our university is working to iden- tify, implement, and bring to scale in-novative knowledge and technologies that promise to completely restructure the way we educate our young, heal our sick, grow our food, and safeguard our borders. \" And that's why I'm here today - to put out the call to you. As students dedicated to developing the full value of human consciousness, you are all desperately needed in the global chal-lenge to find a new path forward.\" The answer is within ourselves Throughout his address Congressman Ryan showed an understanding of the principle of transcending, and how im - portant that experience is in the world today. He spoke about the divisiveness in politics and was clear that we need to go deep within ourselves to find the solution. Quoting Jim W allis, the theo - logian and political activist, he said, \"Don't go further left, don't go further right: we all need to go deeper.\" And he was clear that \"in this depth we experience the underlying unity of life.\" He went on to say how import- ant it is to be established in that unity: \"W e are living in a moment that calls out for leaders who are wiser, smart-er, and bigger than our problems. W e need leaders who are established in that underlying unity of life, so that they can see that our differences and diversity - whether in language, cultur - al inflections, or political beliefs - are our greatest strength. And this diver - sity provides opportunity for competi-tion - the competition of ideas, of how we can best govern ourselves and our world.\" Noting some of the challenges we face on this planet, he addressed phys- icist Stephen Hawking's contention that establishing a colony on the moon will allow life to thrive. Congressman Ryan disagreed, saying the answer lies within ourselves: \"W e don't need powerful rocket en- gines to make life better, we need pow - erful tools to unlock our own human potential. And how do we advance all of humanity? The answer is not on the moon, it's in ourselves.\" The courage to lead society to a new Renaissance Congressman Ryan compared soci- ety today to the Dark Ages and spoke about a book by Edwin Friedman ti- tled A Failure of Nerve , in which Fried - man describes characteristics of Dark Ages and argues that it was the cour - age of the great navigators that helped the Middle Ages break free. Their ad-ventures led to new discoveries that changed the worldview and inspired people to \"question the realities, the orthodoxies, and the set ways of the world,\" Ryan said - ultimately leading to the Renaissance. Who are the modern-day explorers? Those who transcend and grow in ap - preciation of the underlying unity of existence. Congressman Ryan was clear about the special mission of MUM graduates: \"Y ou are the modern day explorers. Y our meditation practice will assist you in navigating the turbulent waters of modern society. \"Y our Consciousness-Based edu- cation has prepared you to take your place among those leaders who are re - defining the rules and changing the way we all see things - and our nation and the world desperately need you now. \"W e have gathered here today to honor and celebrate something both modern and ancient - something as old as human life on earth: the ability to access the silence, the unity, that lies deep within. And that silence, as you well know, is a reservoir of unlimited creativity, intelligence, energy, and hap - piness. That's your adventure, to live your life from the deepest and best part of you - the quiet part. \"I challenge you: Do something with it.\" A call to action Congressman Ryan concluded with a stirring call to action for the graduates, again recognizing their special advan-tages and urging them to make a dif-ference. \"Many of the answers to the chal- lenges we confront as a people run right through this great university in the magnificent cornfields of Iowa. \"Please don't keep your talents to yourself. \"This country - and our world - need you to be an army of wisdom, compassion, and connectedness show - ing the world how to be awake, to be connected, and to be energized by the tremendous power that lies within. \"When John F . Kennedy wrote Pro - files in Courage, he celebrated stories of great political courage. But he knew the difference between studying something and doing something. \"'The stories of past courage,' Ken- nedy wrote, 'can teach, they can offer hope, they can provide inspiration. But they cannot supply courage itself. For this, each man must look into his own soul.' \"Graduates, look into your own souls and find the courage to believe you can make a difference, the courage to imag- ine the world as it should be, and the courage to take us forward where we need to go. \"Graduates of Maharishi University of Management, answer the call and lead us to the next Renaissance, for our country and for the world. \"Graduates, lead - and take us on an adventure.\" A reflection of how times have changed Congressman Ryan's address was not only inspiring, it marked a sea change in a leading official's openness about meditation. In the past there were oc- casional rumors that some members of Congress were \"closet meditators\": they practiced the Transcendental Medita - tion technique but didn't tell anyone about it because they were afraid of be - ing too far out of the mainstream. Times have changed. T oday a mem- ber of Congress not only openly prac-tices meditation, but actively promotes it, and deeply appreciates the value. W e thank Congressman Ryan for his cour - age and vision and for leading the way toward a better world. \"We don't need pow - erful rocket engines to make life better, we need powerful tools to unlock our own hu-man potential. \"\"We need leaders who are established in that underlying unity of life. \" Congressman Tim Ryan Congressman Ryan receives honory doctorate degreeUNIVERSITY REPORT 2016-2017 | 15 FEATURES Cleaning up waterways, abandoned coal mines, and more... Her dream began at a young age when, as a child, she read Ra - chel Carson's classic book Si - lent Spring , which told the story of how pesticides were killing birds. As an un-dergraduate student at Maharishi Uni - versity of Management, she pursued her dream by majoring in sustainable living, where she learned how to work with nature while also helping commu- nities to develop. After graduating in 2008, she fo - cused on helping Fairfield become more sustainable. As part of a grant from Alliant Energy and the Iowa State University extension office, she was project coordinator on an energy efficiency campaign that resulted in an 8.5% reduction in energy use in Fair - field. Her many other activities includ- ed helping to oversee the planting of a community orchard, incorporating en-ergy efficiency into a new house being built by Habitat for Humanity, weath-erizing homes, installing solar panels, and more. But she wanted to be able to contrib - ute in even more ways, and decided to go for a dual master's degree at Iowa State University, graduating with an MS in sustainable agriculture and in community and regional planning. Helping Fairfield with watershed management T oward the end of her degree program, she took a course on watershed man-agement. The issues are many. If cities and farmers are not careful, they can dump pollutants into wherever runoff water ends up, whether streams, ponds, or lakes. Management also entails en-suring that the water cycle - the move - ment of water through land and air - can function in a healthy way. During the course, her professor re - quired her to explore a watershed issue related to her thesis, and her home - town of Fairfield presented her with a perfect opportunity. For years the city's sewage system hadn't been able to ac-commodate heavy rainfall, resulting in overflows of raw sewage into Crow Creek, which runs through campus and borders the east side of Fairfield. Because of her growing reputation in Fairfield, and her solid academic back-ground, Anna was hired to facilitate the Crow Creek W atershed Assess- ment. She wrote a final plan that would help the city map out future improve - ment projects. \"It was very fulfilling,\" she says, having the opportunity to ap - ply what she had been learning while at the same time helping her hometown deal with a serious problem. She worked on the city's application for a competitive loan program from the USDA, which awarded the city a nearly $25 million low-interest loan to put in a new wastewater treatment plant - a project that's now underway. Named executive director of Pathfinders When Anna graduated in 2014 with her master's degrees, she was immedi-ately hired by Pathfinders RC&D to, unsurprisingly, be their watershed co - ordinator and environmental planner. Due to her experience, education, pas-sion, and accomplishments, the Path-finders' board of directors named her executive director in 2016.Cleaning up abandoned coal mines So what does Anna do to clean up an abandoned strip mine? She works with local soil and water conservation dis- tricts and the State of Iowa to write grant proposals for the cleanup. Once the grant is funded, Pathfinders ad-ministers the grant, and works with the state and contractors to complete the restoration. So far 100 of 300 aban- doned strip coal mines in the state have been returned to a more natural state, with Pathfinders partnering on 40 of those. Reclaiming the land entails grading the large hills of waste rock and the deep gullies that result from digging into the earth to extract coal. The soil and water on the entire site are highly acidic due to the exposure to coal dust, so reclamation also entails adding lime to the soil to reduce the acidity. After the project is done, the land can be used for wildlife habitat or light animal grazing. Anna explains that the mines they're working to reclaim were active before 1977 - before there were rules and reg-ulations that require mining companies to restore the landscape to the condi-tion it was in before it was mined. \"The sites we reclaim are barren,\" she said. \"The topsoil - that rich, biologi-cally abundant, layer of soil that is good for planting seeds in - is gone.\" She says it takes 100 to 500 years to rebuild one inch of topsoil. \"Reclaiming a surface coal mine is like putting a Band-Aid on a scrape,\" Anna says. \"Except instead of the heal- is making a difference in southeast IowaAlumna Anna Bruen An abandoned coal mine is a toxic mess, dangerous for both animals and hu- mans. Iowa has 300 abandoned strip mines, and alumna Anna Bruen is play - ing an important role in reclaiming that land and restoring it to a natural state. That's just one of the many projects she's focusing on as executive director of Pathfinders Resource Conservation & Development, a Fairfield-based nonprofit organization that serves counties throughout southeast Iowa.A Dream job It is, she says, her dream job: helping communities thrive economically while at the same time improving their relationship with the environment. And she says her degree in sustainable living gave her an important foundation for this job through its emphasis on the connectivity between people and the planet. 14 | MAHARISHI UNIVERSITY OF MANAGEMENTUNIVERSITY REPORT 2016-2017 | 17 16 | MAHARISHI UNIVERSITY OF MANAGEMENTFEATURES ing time being a couple of days or a week, the recovery period is deca des.\" After reclamation, sites are best left untouched as much as possible. They are great areas for wildlife and polli-nator habitat or lightly grazing cattle, which can help add organic matter. The State of Iowa works with land- owners to help determine what seed mix to plant, based on what they envi-sion for their land. \"I get most excited when sites are planted to a native prai-rie/pollinator mix,\" Anna says. \"There's a site right now in Southeast Iowa that's being reclaimed with a natural stream design and the landowner is going to be harvesting prairie seed and planting it at the site.\" Watershed management The reclamation of an abandoned strip mine also includes watershed manage - ment, since runoff either creates lifeless pools of acidic water, or drains highly toxic water into area streams. W atershed management projects, as Anna has worked on in Fairfield and in conjunction with abandoned coal mines, is a major offering of Path- finders. Iowa's streams are some of the most polluted in the country, and com - munities are increasingly concerned - as is the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Anna and her staff will work with a community and state agencies to determine where the water is draining to, such as a stream, then assess the quality of the water running into the stream, then identify oppor - tunities to improve the situation, and then specify the necessary steps for that improvement. Creating vibrant communities Pathfinders' portfolio is actually much broader than cleanup, however. Their mission is to \"create vibrant communi- ties by strengthening local economies and encouraging natural resource con- servation.\" Community development is an important part of their mission. They envision helping to \"create thriv - ing hubs of economic activity,\" which will \"provide a high quality of life for the residents.\" As an example, Anna talks about an- other of her favorite projects: the Iowa Scenic Byways. Iowa has many scenic areas, and has designated certain high- ways that traverse these areas as \"scenic byways.\" That helps drive tourism to these locales, fostering local economies. But the communities along the sce - nic byways may not be prepared to take advantage of the greater attention. Pathfinders partners with the Iowa De - partment of Transportation and with these communities to \"build capacity.\" They work with them to seize oppor - tunities such as holding events that further draw tourists. And they pro - vide support to businesses, organiza - tions, museums, recreation centers, and other attractions so they can bring in more visitors. This collaboration with the community even gets into details such as what sorts of directional signs are needed and where they should be placed. The overall goal is to improve the quality of life for the residents. \"I get excited and feel good when I see people enjoying the communi-ties where they live, regardless of how much direct involvement Pathfinders or myself had,\" Anna says. \"W e're really here to support what people living in Iowa want for their communities and more often than not, it's about increas- ing people's quality of life and access to resources. So when business owners can expand a product line because of a loan from Pathfinders, or when peo - ple feel empowered to ask questions about water quality because of a press release we wrote, or when people learn something new about the region - like the fact that there was coal mining or that the Mormon Trail was through this area - that's exciting to me. It's also exciting when we organize something, like the Solar Energy Fairs we hosted last year, and people come from miles around to see and learn.\" She also gives an example of writ- ing a watershed management plan for a county park, a plan that's now being used to receive state and federal fund- ing to follow up on the strategies in the plan. \"That's fulfilling,\" she says, eyes twinkling. An emphasis on collaboration But don't use the word \"help\" when describing the role of Pathfinders in these communities. Anna explains that Pathfinders does NOT tell communi- ties what they should be doing. Rather, she emphasizes that it's a collaboration, with Pathfinders staff participating in the community and working with lo - cal individuals, businesses, community groups, and government agencies. \"W e focus on what the people living in the community want,\" she says. \"W e partner on what they want, and accom-plish projects together. I appreciate that each community and organization has a distinct identity. I try to enhance that by focusing on their priorities and their economic activity, landscape, and ecolog y.\" From event planning to project development So what is Pathfinders RC&D? Re - source Conservation & Development Councils were established nationwide by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 1962, with each serving 5-8 coun-ties. Each operated as an incorporat-ed nonprofit. Fairfield launched their RC&D in 1978. Early on the USDA supported these nonprofits financially, but that ended in 2011. That means, Fairfield's Pathfinders RC&D must maintain a stream of income to sup - port their activities and pay the staff of four that works with Anna. Most of their funding comes from grants, donations, and financial sup - port from their six member counties. But they also offer a variety of fee-based services throughout Southeast Iowa, such as grant writing, project development, strategic planning, event planning, and more. Their fees are low, however, and their services mesh well with their broader interest in nurturing communities. Rotary Club award Anna's passion for nurturing Fairfield was recognized in early 2017 when the Rotary Club awarded her a $6,000 scholarship to help pay back her stu-dent loans. The club had announced a scholarship to be awarded to a recent college graduate who planned to make Fairfield his or her home. Anna qual-ified, having finished her master's de - grees in 2014, so she applied. In awarding the scholarship to Anna, Pat Hurley, the scholarship committee chairman, said, \"One of the applicants really stood out as embodying all the qualities and values of Rotary, and that was Anna Bruen. It was very clear from Anna's essay that she is completely dedicating her life to serving her com-munity. Her primary goals are to help the Fairfield community grow, to bring people of different backgrounds to - gether, and to help others to live happy, healthy, and prosperous lives.\" A dedication to improving lives That certainly describes Anna, whose dedication to improving the lives of everyone in Fairfield goes far beyond her career at Pathfinders. She teaches yoga classes, serves on the board of two non-profit organizations, and in the past has volunteered with a range of groups, such as Carry On Bags, Girls on the Run, The Lord's Cupboard, Fairfield's Go-Green Commission, and the Y oung Professionals of Fairfield. A current concern she has is senior citizen housing. The baby boom gen-eration moved to Fairfield en masse when in 1979 Maharishi invited prac- titioners of the Transcendental Med- itation and TM-Sidhi programs to join a large group doing their practice together to help foster peace in the world. This has created a demographic bulge, so Anna worked with a commu- nity member to distribute and collect a survey and found that there will be an imminent need for more facilities for senior citizens - a situation she hopes to help address. So what does the future hold? Anna looks forward to continuing to re - spond to the needs of communities and organizations in the region - nat- ural resource conservation, agriculture, housing, community development, and quality of life. \"When I was in school I definite - ly had in mind that I wanted to lead projects that would benefit the envi- ronment and our human communities, and here I am,\" she says. \"We focus on what the people living in the community want. We partner on what they want, and accomplish projects together. \" - Anna Bruen Southeast Iowa abandoned coal mine land restored to a natural state UNIVERSITY REPORT 2016-2017 | 19You might think of a board of trustees as men and women in business dress gathering in a boardroom several times a year to review budgets and policies and give general direction. But that doesn't describe MUM's current board. They do so much more. They oversee renovation and construction, travel the country to meet wealthy donors, provide funds for specialized faculty training and new buildings, develop fresh ideas to promote the university, and hatch plans to power the campus with solar energy. PITCH IN ON ALL FACETS OF CAMPUS LIFEA NEW ERA... MUM TRUSTEESFEATURES 18 | MAHARISHI UNIVERSITY OF MANAGEMENTVisionary new chair and vice- chair spur change Much of the credit goes to Jeffrey Abramson and T om Stanley, the board's chair and vice-chair for the past nine years. Mr. Abramson, a partner in The T ow - er Companies, an award-winning real estate development firm in the W ash-ington, DC area, simply had an expand-ed vision for the board. \"Being a trustee of MUM means you are responsible for raising the donations to support growth, research, and scholarships; for assuring that our students are getting the best education; for providing financial over - sight; for renovating the campus and erecting new facilities and public spaces; and for preserving the university for gen-erations.\" His vision for MUM is to reach an en- rollment of 1,500 on-campus students by 2022. Beyond that, he wants those students to be a \"brilliant reflection of the benefits of Consciousness-Based SM education.\" He envisions a student who develops a \"vast interest in learning, a special inner alertness and deep con-fidence that inspires a world of fresh ideas, and a humane and socially con-scious leader capable of building a safe and prosperous world.\" The keys to making things happen It's a compelling vision, one that has motivated him to get the trustees deeply involved. And he and Mr. Stanley knew the two central keys to making things happen: organization and accountability. They believed the trustees could best apply their impressive talents and expe - rience by working in committees related to their areas of expertise. Currently the 34 trustees are organized into 10 com- mittees actively involved in every area of the university, with most serving on multiple committees. Mr. Stanley helps oversee these committees and coordi- nates how they interact with the admin- istration and faculty. MUM trustees meet with senior administratorsJeffrey Abramson Tom StanleyUNIVERSITY REPORT 2016-2017 | 21 20 | MAHARISHI UNIVERSITY OF MANAGEMENTFEATURES \" A number of the trustees have be - come inspired to take responsibility for certain aspects of our university, and work closely in supporting administra - tive and academic initiatives to improve the campus and student satisfaction,\" Mr. Stanley said. \"They work with their administrative counterparts to identify where the trustees can be most helpful in their support. Our goal is continu- ous improvement.\" Mr. Abramson and Mr. Stanley have also focused on accountability, to en-sure each committee is adding value. Mr. Stanley regularly phones commit- tee chairs, and he and Mr. Abramson speak at least twice a month to assess progress. \"T om is an incredible administra - tor, deeply dedicated to MUM and the Fairfield community and to the growth of our programs worldwide,\" Mr. Abramson said. \"W e have a very special partnership.\" Let's take a look at some of the trust- ees' recent activities. Toby Lieb - Creating pleasing public spaces The trustees' most visible activity for the past several years has been renova - tion and construction, thanks in large part to the members of the Student Life and Sustainable Campus Devel - opment committees. T oby Lieb, who co-chairs the Stu- dent Life committee, has most recently overseen extensive landscaping around Crow Creek, transforming tangles of dead trees, vines, and brush into a love - ly park. The work, funded through her family foundation, included renovating the arched Japanese footbridge that was slated to be torn down. This was the latest of many previ- ous projects. T oby's family foundation, in memory of the late trustee Charley Lieb, funded the Argiro Student Cen-ter garden and fountain and its ongo - ing maintenance. She has also been responsible for landscaping around residence halls and other areas and for upgrading the MUM community garden, providing new planting box-es, topsoil, gardening tools, and land- scaping. The benches and picnic tables around campus are also thanks to her. Public spaces like these are an im- portant part of \"the new master plan to integrate new buildings within new public spaces that connect students and visitors to the richness of a vibrant campus life,\" Mr. Abramson says. Doug Greenfield - Renovating residence halls One of the most active trustees in transforming the campus has been developer Doug Greenfield. He's built some two dozen Maharishi V astu homes and condominiums on campus, plus office buildings and apartments. He also designed, funded, and oversaw the construction of MUM's Golden Dome Market & Caf\u00e9, a successful en-terprise for the university community. More recently he has been a major force behind renovating the student dormitories. The women's dorm, Hild - enbrand Hall, has been completely ren-ovated, with funding provided by Mr. Abramson. With Doug's continued ef- fort to improve student life, work has now been completed on the five men's dorms. This has entailed deep clean-ing brick exteriors and repairing and painting the porches, trim details, and entryways. Interior lobbies were reno - vated, adding new lighting, carpet, and furniture. Upgrading of the heating and air conditioning systems was a ma - jor accomplishment for greater student comfort. \"Doug is totally hands-on,\" said Craig Pearson, vice president of aca - demic affairs. \"He's very experienced in construction and oversees the staff and contractors' work.\" \"Doug is bold - a dynamic force in fundraising for renovations, as well as for every area of the university,\" Mr. Abramson said. \"He's awesome - there's nothing he won't do.\" The trustees' campus work has gone beyond renovation. W orking with MUM leaders they have created a new master plan that maps a path toward a further transformation.Ed Malloy - Meeting wealthy donors A major board responsibility is rais- ing donations to support university growth, and perhaps no trustee has taken that more to heart than Fairfield Mayor Ed Malloy. As head of the Institutional Ad- vancement committee, he has spear - headed the university's endowment campaign, bringing in over $9 million in donations and pledges. This effort has entailed many trips around the country and over 100 meetings and so - licitations. \"Ed has really been a driving force behind the endowment campaign,\" says Nick Rosania, co-executive director of Institutional Advancement. \"He's an ideal representative of the university, committed to attracting the financial support necessary for our continuing growth. When he meets with donors, he presents his vision of the universi-ty's bright future. His business suc-cess, professionalism, organizational skills, eloquence, and enthusiasm gives donors confidence to increase their support and leave a legacy. As mayor of Fairfield since 2001, Ed has shown extraordinary leadership skills, and the Board of Trustees has benefited as well.\" Tom Factor - Planning a solar array The trustees are also focused on saving money. And what better way to save money while creating an environmen- tally friendly campus than installing a large solar array to provide 40% of the campus's electricity needs? University President John Hage - lin, during the 2017 commencement ceremony, signed the Paris Climate Initiative, pledging MUM would do its part to become carbon neutral. T o this end, plans are underway to build a 1.5-megawatt solar ar - ray with an integrated 1-megawatt Tesla battery storage system capable of providing energy day and night. The project is headed by trustee T om Factor working with alumni Troy and Amy V an Beek's Ideal Energy company and in coordination the MUM admin- istration. Fortunately, the university has just the place for solar arrays. Several years \"Being a trustee of MUM means you are responsible for raising the donations to support growth, research, and scholarships; for assur - ing that our students are getting the best education; for providing financial oversight; for renovating the campus and erecting new fa-cilities and public spaces; and for preserving the university for gener - ations. \" - Board of Trustees Chairman Jeffrey Abramson Toby Lieb Doug Greenfield Ed Malloy Tom Factor Laura Wege Creating pleasing public spaces: renovated arched Japanese footbridge.UNIVERSITY REPORT 2016-2017 | 23 22 | MAHARISHI UNIVERSITY OF MANAGEMENTFEATURES The MUM Board of Trustees Jeffrey Abramson - board chair Rogers BadgettLarry Chroman - DreierTom FactorJosie Fauerso - chair, Compensation and Evaluation Committee Paul GelderloosRashi Glazer - Marketing, Admissions and Public Relations Committee Fred GratzonDoug Greenfield - chair, Sustainable Campus Development CommitteeJohn HagelinCarolyn KingKeith LeviToby Lieb - co-chair, emeritusRavi PatelNeil PatersonEric SchwartzRam Shrivastava - chair, Expansion and Global Affairs Committee Tom Stanley - board vice-chair, chair, Governance Committee Keith Wallace - co-chair, Student Life CommitteeLaura WegeMaureen WynneRobert Wynne Rashi Glazer gives a presentation on marketing while trustee Fred Gratzon looks on.ago, former trustee Ramani Ayer and Louise Ayer donated the funds for MUM to purchase 99 acres of land im- mediately west of campus. About half of that is unbuildable - but perfectly situated for solar arrays. Each array will require about 5 acres, so there's room to add more arrays over time. Although the project is still in plan- ning, Mr. Factor is just the person to make it happen. A pioneer in wind energy research and implementation, he has developed over 40 utility-scale wind farms in the U.S. for NextEra Energy. A local utility has expressed interest in owning and operating a 1.5-MW project on MUM land. In addition, Mr. Factor is structuring an investment group to build a 1.5-MW project, whose ownership would transfer to the university once the investment is recov - ered. The federal tax credits and depre - ciation allowance for solar, provided to qualified investors, would allow inves- tors to recover their investment in just one to two years. An investor-funded solar field will significantly lower the university's utility bills. For informa - tion contact T om Factor at tfactor@lisco.com. Laura Wege - Upgrading faculty expertise Trustees also support academics, help - ing ensure high quality of instruction. Trustee Laura W ege, along with her husband Chris, have helped faculty stay on the leading edge of their dis-ciplines by dedicating $120,000 from the W ege Foundation to support facul-ty attending academic conferences and professional development workshops. As a former MUM student, Laura deeply appreciates the faculty's efforts and their endless devotion to their dis-ciplines. Dozens of faculty have taken ad- vantage of this new opportunity. They have attended conferences and work-shops on such topics as data analyt-ics, computer graphics, virtual reality, team-based learning, renewable ener - gy, presentation media, academic ad-vising, and instructional design. W ege Foundation grants have also support- ed faculty research on the Maharishi Effect, lean management, Maharishi V edic Science SM, sustainability curric - ula, and the effects of Maharishi V astu architecture on a building's inhabitants. Plus, grants have also supported facul- ty giving presentations at national con-ferences and workshops on such topics as \"The axiom of infinity, QFT, and large cardinals,\" \"The effects of Ayurve - da medicines on cardiovascular risk factors,\" and \"Maharishi V edic Science and agriculture.\" In recent years, the W ege Founda - tion has also donated over $100,000 to support interpersonal communica - tions and leadership skills training for students, staff, and faculty, as well as $17,000 to support training in incor - porating learning communities into the curriculum. The benevolence of the W ege Foun- dation, inspired by Laura W ege, has even extended to the purchase of Maharishi V edic Organic produce for the campus dining hall - showing that she and Chris are intent on nurturing the body as well as the mind. Plus, the foundation, along with Mr. Abramson, donated $112,000 to build the 37.8-kilowatt solar array by the Men's Dome. And the foundation has con-tributed $300,000 to MUM's endow - ment fund over the past three years. Spreading the word about MUM Recruiting new students has also been a major focus, with the trustees' com-mittee on Marketing, Admissions, and Public Relations headed by Rashi Glazer, former professor of market-ing at the University of California - Berkeley. Committee members work with the faculty to learn about their programs and identify marketing strat- egies. Eric Schwartz (founder of Cam- bridge Investment Research) and Mr. Abramson worked with the Computer Professionals program to help increase enrollment by over a third, primarily by taking advantage of Facebook ads. The marketing committee is now broaden-ing their focus to include online learn-ing, such as the program in integrative medicine. Providing background support While many of the trustees are con- tributing in obvious and visible ways, Mr. Stanley says, others are less visible but no less important. He cites how closely trustee Michael Dimick and other members of the Finance commit-tee - Eric Schwartz, T ed McLaughlin, Ed Malloy, and Robert Wynne - work with MUM treasurer Michael Spivak. Trustees Susie and Michael Dillbeck work with the faculty to develop their expertise in Consciousness-Based ed-ucation. The Student Life committee works with Amellia Hesse, dean of Student Life, and meets regularly with students, faculty, and residence assis-tants to ensure the students have high quality of life and experience. The trustees' purview extends be - yond the university. They are actively engaging the community of meditators and sidhas in Fairfield and Maharishi V edic City to strengthen relationships and engagement. This includes open forums in which they gather the ideas and concerns of community members. Past record of support Trustees and former trustees have long been exceptionally generous in sup - porting the university. The late trustee Dr. Keene Dimick, a founding board member, and his wife originally lent the money for the Fairfield campus. Trustee Barbara Dreier and trustee T oby Lieb and her late husband Char - ley helped fund the university's first Maharishi V astu building, the Dreier Building, named in honor of T ed and Bobbi Dreier. Former trustee Vincent Argiro and alumna Maggie Argiro donated $2 million toward the Argiro Student Center. Former trustee Joni Kimberlin funded Dalby Hall in that building and generously supported the university's endowment fund. Trustee T ed McLaughlin and Barb McLaugh-lin funded the computer science build- ing. In addition, current trustee Eric Schwartz helped fund the Schwartz-Guich Sustainable Living Center, as well as renovation of student dorms and V errill Hall. Former trustee Stu- art Zimmerman and the Zimmerman family donated Utopia Park, which houses many faculty, staff, and stu-dents. Mr. Zimmerman also funded numerous projects on campus, includ- ing the Recreation Center and campus roads. Trustee Bruce Currivan funded the 2015 repair of Golden Dome W ay that runs past the Men's Dome. And current trustee Fred Gratzon funded the paving of Granville Avenue. And more... There is more, of course - extensive committee meetings, meetings with students, faculty, administration, and the community at large, classroom vis- its and lectures to students, walking the campus, and advising specific academic departments. Maharishi University of Manage - ment is grateful to have dedicated trustees devoted to creating the best educational experience for our stu-dents.UNIVERSITY REPORT 2016-2017 | 25FEATURES Non-credit online courses also popularMUM ONLINE Over 100 enrolled Many others are saying the same thing, and enrollment has surged in the on-line master's programs, especially the MS in Maharishi AyurV eda SM and In - tegrative Medicine. In the fall of 2017, that program enrolled 50 new stu- dents, and 11 new students enrolled in Maharishi V edic Science, bringing the total enrollment to over 100 in these two programs, which both take three years to complete. \"W e're pleased to see interest picking up in our online offerings,\" said Rod Eason, vice president of enrollment management and marketing. \"Integra - tive medicine is becoming an import-ant component in medical treatment, and we expect to eventually have hun- dreds enrolled in this program.\" These two master's programs launched in 2014 in response to de - mand. People around the world want-ed the education that Maharishi Uni- versity of Management offers, but often weren't able to move to Fairfield to study. \"W e want to satisfy all aspects of our market,\" says V anessa Haskins, the department administrator for MUM Online.A program for aspiring health practitioners Count Roxanna Medeiros one who is satisfied. She's been interested in Ayurveda for some 20 years and had recently been practicing it at a spa in Boulder, Colo - rado. But then two Ayurve - dic doctors (called vaidy - as) who she had consulted and who had travelled with Maharishi in earlier years suggested she get more formal training - and recommended the online MS through Maharishi University of Man-agement. That sounded perfect to her, since she could continue her work at the spa while also deepening her knowledge of Maharishi AyurV eda and integrative medicine. She began the Transcen-dental Meditation technique about six months before beginning the program and had such amazing experiences that it helped convince her to enroll. T wo years on, she decided that the Transcendental Meditation technique had benefitted her so much that she knew it was something she wanted her two children to have. So prior to her third and final year in the program, the family moved to Fairfield, and her children, ages 5 and 12, enrolled in Maharishi School. Recorded lectures, live webinars, online forums Clearly, the MUM Online master's degrees are meeting a need. And the format for delivering the instruction is proving to work well, though is con- stantly being modified according to student feedback, V anessa says. Lectures are recorded, and students can view them at their convenience. MUM Online, which has a small team of videographers, strives to make the lessons visually interesting and highly professional rather than simply pre - senting a talking head. In addition, both the Maharishi V e - dic Science and integrative medicine programs offer live webinars: using state-of-the-art internet technology, the teacher appears live via internet streaming, and students have the op - portunity to interact with the teacher, ask questions, and interact with each If you're a regular world traveler like Cathrine McIntosh, someone inclined to walk across the Pyrenees as she did recently, you might think you wouldn't be able to enroll in a master's program, even though the idea appeals to you. Cathrine, however, opted for the online MA in Maharishi Vedic Science, and it fit well into her travels and busy professional life as head of legal in the dispute resolution department at a major bank in New Zealand. She was the online program's first graduate in June 2017. \"It's a wonderful program and a fantastic way to learn, \" she says. \"I found it entirely suited my lifestyle. It provided the flexibility for me to focus on learning during the week when the time was right for me, while at the same time allowed me to continue to meet the demands of a busy career. \" Plus, it accommodated her travel to Europe, India, the U.S., and Australia while she was a student. \"Like for my career, during the time I was studying, the flexibility of the online program meant that I was able to travel, live, or work in any country in the world while still being able to participate in the online program. \"Enrollment surges in online master's programs in Maharishi AyurVeda and Maharishi Vedic Science Cathrine McIntosh is shown here on her walk to Cape Finisterre in Spain. She continued her studies while traveling the world. 24 | MAHARISHI UNIVERSITY OF MANAGEMENTDr. Paul Morehead makes a video for online students. Roxanna Medeiros26 | MAHARISHI UNIVERSITY OF MANAGEMENT UNIVERSITY REPORT 2016-2017 | 27other. Both programs also offer online forums in which the students can post questions and messages and interact among themselves and with the teach- er. Since the integrative medicine program teaches the students to offer health consultations that include Maharishi AyurV eda pulse assessment, the curriculum requires they come to campus for five days each year for an intensive clinical session in which they give consultations to members of the community and receive feedback on their consultations from the program's clinical faculty. Detecting imbalances in the physiology While the integrative medicine pro - gram exposes students to a broad spec- trum of natural healing modalities, the focus is on Maharishi AyurV eda. \"W e learned how to look at the broad spectrum of influences within and out- side of an individual - every aspect of life that impacts our health, conscious-ness, physiology: our own nature, the laws of nature, our actions, emotions, thoughts, and the near and far environ-ment,\" says alumna Shellie Lackman. \"The program teaches students how to determine a person's constitution in order to prescribe highly personalized wellness modalities. W e're exposed to a multitude of case studies, which also shows us a wide variety of individual makeup and imbalances.\" This curriculum is just what Vince Glasser, a Transcendental Medita -tion teacher on Long Island, was looking for. He was eager to learn more ways to help people, and for years he re - searched vari - ous Ayurveda training pro - grams. When he learned about MUM's online offering, he decided to go for it. The other programs, he says, weren't as complete because they were missing the crucial element of consciousness as the most important aspect of Ayurve - da. \"It's been a major fulfillment of a life - long desire to help people in every way that I can think of,\" he says. Health consultants Vince is now in his third and final year in the Maharishi AyurV eda and Integrative Medicine program and looks forward to becoming a certified Maharishi AyurV eda consultant along with his master's degree when he graduates, giving educational talks and consultations at Transcendental Meditation centers, spas, and health centers, as well as via Skype. Some states, referred to as \"health freedom states,\" allow Ayurveda practitioners to give consultations on their own, while other states require practitioners to work in conjunction with a licensed physician. As a graduate, Shellie is now a certi- fied Maharishi AyurV eda practitioner, and because she lives in Iowa she can only practice under a licensed medical professional. She sees clients in Fair - field, at the MUM Campus Clinic, un- der Dr. Jim Davis and with a vaidya. A consultation entails asking clients questions and discussing their health concerns and goals, as well as using Maharishi AyurV eda pulse assessment to determine their body type and cur - rent state of balance in their physiology. She then explains what the symptoms suggest and the approaches the person might like to try, such as particular Ayurveda formulas. She then reminds clients that this is a natural, integrative health care program that restores bal-ance from a fundamental level. If they are concerned about a disease, they should always get the advice of their licensed health care practitioner. Other students may not have specific plans to become practitioners, but are simply eager to apply the knowledge in their own lives. And still other students come into the program already being credentialed medical professionals who want to expand their practice to in-clude integrative medicine. Vince says his cohort includes doctors, massage therapists, yoga instructors, certified herbalists, and health coaches. Non-credit courses open to everyone While the MS in Maharishi AyurV e - da and Integrative Medicine is open only to degree-seeking students, in- dividual courses in the online MA in Maharishi V edic Science are available to anyone interested in being im-mersed in Maharishi's knowledge. Courses such as the Bhagavad Gita, Sanskrit, and Maharishi Self-Pulse assessment have been quite popu- lar among those who simply want knowledge for fulfillment. Often there are 10-15 enrolled in a course in ad-dition to those who are enrolled as degree-seeking students. Those not taking the course for credit follow the same structure as the other students: streaming the online presentations and participating in webinars and on-line forums. They do, however, have a longer period to finish the course. And should they enjoy the courses so much that they decide to go for the master's degree, they can apply up to two cours-es toward the degree. All the courses offered in the MA in Maharishi V edic Science are open to everyone, except the capstone project, which entails writing a thesis. Other courses offered include Enlightenment; Modern Science and Maharishi V edic Science; Maharishi V edic Science and Physics; V eda; Principles of Maharishi V edic Science; and Engaging Nature's Government. Short online courses for personal enrichment In addition to the Maharishi V edic Sci- ence courses, MUM Online also offers more than 15 courses for personal en- richment. Unlike the master's courses, which have specific start dates and a cohort of students, these courses can be taken at any time. The price ranges from $49 to $300, with between 8 and 48 lessons per course. T opics range from Ayurvedic cooking and organic gardening to the essence of Buddhism and the inner state of yoga. In every case the first les-son is free. Plus, the nine-lesson course titled \"Crafting a Life and Career with Purpose\" is completely free. There are no assignments or tests, and those who register have up to a year to view the course. One of the more popular courses has been Professor Evan Finkelstein's course on Maharishi V edic Science and world religions that explores the universal principles expressed in Maharishi V edic Science, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. \"Dr. Finklestein not only clarifies our understanding of the very deep - est level of Maharishi's knowledge but also reveals its universal expression in the three major W estern religions,\" said Susi Haley. \"It opens up a wholly new understanding of the scriptures that's personally inspiring and meaningful.\" And student Angela Ungurianu views the course as being especially rel-evant given the religious conflicts in the world today, saying that the course \"cre - ates a basis for peace among religions. I think this aspect is very important for humankind in our time.\" Creating a seamless learning experience MUM Online began offering enrich- ment courses in 2012, and then in 2014 expanded to offer the master's programs. \"W e want to give our audi- ence the best of Maharishi's knowledge and deliver it in the best way possible,\" V anessa says. \"For many years MUM offerings weren't online, but people around the world wanted this knowl- edge - and they wanted it online. Our online students are a very diverse group of people.\" V anessa says the goal of MUM On- line is for students to be happy and ful- filled. \"W e want them to be happy with their purchase, and with the technolo - gy used to access the courses. W e want to make it a seamless experience.\" Information about the master's pro - grams and personal enrichment cours- es offered by MUM Online can be found at www.mum.edu/mum-online. Other programs migrating online While the offerings from MUM On- line have been a major focus, five other MUM programs also have an online component. Plus, even the courses of- fered locally by Continuing Education are often made available for viewing online for two months after the cours-es conclude. The version of the MBA that's of- fered on campus in the evening and on weekends - for those who are unable to be full-time students - is also avail-able as an online degree. The classroom lectures are live-streamed, and students in time zones who can't conveniently tune in at that time can view them lat-er. So far, a small number of students have taken advantage of this offering, and the first three graduated in 2016. In addition, the low-residency MFA in screenwriting is mostly taught on-line, with students coming to campus for 10 days at the beginning of each se - mester for lectures and workshops. The two professionals programs at the master's level also have an online component: the accounting MBA and the Computer Professionals Program (which enrolls 300-400 new students each year). In both of these programs, the students come to campus for the first two semesters, and then are placed in paid practicum positions around the country. During this two-year practi-cum period they take their remaining courses online. Finally, students at Maharishi In- vincibility Institute in South Africa enrolled in MUM's undergraduate program in business also receive their instruction via live streaming. In the days before electronic media, students convened in schools because that's where the teachers and the books were. But now knowledge can be made available worldwide. And Maharishi University of Management is making great strides toward reaching that wide audience. \"It's a wonderful program and a fantastic way to learn. I found it entirely suited my lifestyle. It provided the flexibility for me to focus on learning during the week when the time was right for me, while at the same time allowed me to continue to meet the demands of a busy career. \" - Cathrine McIntosh, first graduate of the online MA in 28 | MAHARISHI UNIVERSITY OF MANAGEMENTACHIEVEMENTS - FACUL TY The unique of- fering of Maha - rishi AyurV eda is meriting in- creasing na - tional and in-ternational attention, including presentations by Robert Schneider at events at Harvard Uni- versity, the European Society of Hy-pertension in Milan, the International Ayurveda Congress in London, and the W orld Association of V edic Stud- ies in New Delhi, India. Dr. Schneider, dean of MUM's College of Integrative Medicine, was invited to give a keynote address at Harvard alongside India's Minister of Ayurveda and Y oga at a conference on integrating Y oga and Ayurveda into mainstream medicine. In his address, he explained that there's a healing in-telligence within everyone that can be enlivened through Y oga and Ayurveda. He also led the first-ever session on the use of meditation to treat and prevent hypertension at the annu- al meeting of the European Society for Hypertension in Milan, Italy. At the Second International Congress in London he spoke about Conscious-ness-Based approaches to contempo - rary health problems. In addition, Dr. Schneider was in- vited to deliver the keynote address at the annual meeting of the W orld Association of V edic Studies in New Delhi and to teach two public semi- nars. During his 10-day tour in India, he also met with India's Minister of Science and T echnology, Harsh V ard-han, and the Minister of Ayurveda and Y oga. The meetings focused on a possible research collaboration between Maharishi University of Management and medical centers in India and the U.S.Professor David Scharf and alumnus Michael Sternfeld were invited to the W orld Ramayana Confer - ence in Jabalpur, India. The invitation came as a result of their presentations at the biennial meeting of the W orld Association for V edic Studies that MUM hosted two years ago. Mr. Sternfeld spoke on \"Ram's Dharma: Leadership Secrets of the Ultimate W arrior~Sage~Prince.\" Dr. Scharf, a physicist and philosopher of physics, gave a talk entitled \"Insights into the Nature of Time as Expressed in and Through the Ramayana.\" He discussed the story of The Ramayana as both a temporal sequence - a sto - ry that unfolds through time - and an eternal archetype that can be accessed in its totality by any seer whose aware - ness is sufficiently refined. T eaching computers to understand natural language was the topic of a plenary address by Professor Em- dad Khan at the 17th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge Engineering and Data Bases at the University of Cambridge, UK. Since the 1990s Dr. Khan has been re - searching how to program computers to understand natural language - not just voice recognition, as a smartphone can do, but to correctly understand and answer any request spo - ken in normal language, such as, \"Send me the last set of vacation pictures.\" His key development, and the topic of his presentation, is a \"semantic engine\" that uses a brain-like approach. This semantic engine understands words in terms of their function.Presentations Keith and Samantha Wallace publish book on gut health Founding MUM president Keith W al- lace and Samantha W allace have pub - lished a new book that's the ultimate guide to digestive health: Gut Crisis: How Diet, Probiotics, and Friendly Bac - teria Help Y ou Lose Weight and Heal Y our Body and Mind . It explains that poor food choices and the overuse of antibiotics are the main factors that cause imbalance in one's gut, eventual- ly leading to a chronic state of inflammation. The result is in an epidemic of obesity, diabetes, autoimmune disease, heart disease, and degenerative brain disorders. The authors present the most recent and effective treat- ment programs, including practical advice based on what the ancients have known for centuries: by healing one's gut through diet, lifestyle, and simple procedures, one can heal both body and mind. The book gives simple steps one can take to begin to rest and repair one's gut. Dr. Maheshwari publishes books with McGraw-Hill on big data After noticing that two ebooks by Professor Anil Mahesh- wari were top-sellers in the big data category on Amazon, McGraw-Hill contacted him about publishing print editions as part of their series on data science. Dr. Maheshwari's book Data Analytics Made Accessible is a concise and accessible overview of data ana - lytics and provides a tool set of the major data mining techniques and platforms. It has also now been pub - lished in a Chinese edition by a top tech publisher in T aiwan. His book Big Data Essentials covers big data tools such as Hadoop, MapReduce, Spark Streaming, and NoSql. Be - cause his books have become prominent in the field of big data, he has been invited to give presentations at universities such as James Madison University in Virginia, and his vid-eos for promoting the books have earned thousands of likes on Facebook.Dina El Chammas-Gass details student project in education journal Professor Dina El Chammas-Gass published an arti- cle in the Journal of Sustainability Education that showed educators how project-based learning can not only help students learn, but also can be of practical benefit to the community. Students in a sustainable living class assessed storm water management along Crow Creek in order to provide data for the city and make recommendations for solutions. The students addressed a serious situation: storms that lead to raw sewage being discharged into Crow Creek. They used a GPS unit and a standard assessment that entailed gathering information such as water clarity, flow, channel pattern, sediment deposits, and bank erosion. After analyzing the data, they came to some conclusions and then conducted a survey of Fairfield locations to rate each according to how it was contributing to the problem. \"The solutions the students recommended will continue to serve as a long-range watershed plan,\" said Fairfield Mayor Ed Malloy. Dr. Heaton publishes book chapters Dennis Heaton published two book chapters that explore the role of development of conscious - ness in management education and sustainability. His chapter \"Con-sciousness-Development for Re - sponsible Management Education,\" coauthored by student Emanuel Schachinger, discussed the role of development of consciousness in areas of management such as human rights, labor, the en-vironment, and anti-corruption. The chapter appears in Educating for Responsible Management: Putting Theory into Practice , published by Greenleaf Publishing. In addition, Dr. Heaton authored a chapter in the book Spirituality and Sustainability: New Horizons and Exem - plary Approaches , published by Springer. Titled \"High- er Consciousness for Sustainability-as-Flourishing,\" his chapter explains that to solve the problems that are af-fecting the planet, it's necessary to develop higher states of consciousness, states that lead to an optimal quality of life individually and collectively.Books and Journals Dr . Schneider gives addresses at Harvard Medical School and in Milan, London, and New Delhi Professor Khan gives plenary address on natural language computing Faculty, alum present at world Ramayana conference UNIVERSITY REPORT 2016-2017 | 31In November and December art professor Jim Shrosbree enjoyed a residency fel- lowship at MacDowell Colony in Peterborough, NH - the oldest artist residency in the U.S. Mr. Shrosbree's stay was fully supported and afforded him the oppor - tunity to spend five weeks creating art without interruptions. Artists from various disciplines - writers, visual artists, dancers, filmmakers, poets, and playwrights - are awarded a fellowship to attend, the sole criterion being artistic excellence. This is the third residency of its kind that Mr. Shrosbree has been awarded in the last four years. His previous two were at Y addo Artists Colony in Saratoga Springs, NY.Professor Andy Bargerstock and PhD student Y e Shi both received national recognition twice this past year. The Institute of Management Accountants gave them an award in June for having the best article in the peer-reviewed journal Strategic Finance . The article examined U.S. manufacturers that continue to use standard costing even though they have adopted T oyota-style process-improvement techniques. In August 2016 Dr. Bargerstock received the Excellence in Lean Accounting Professor of the Y ear for 2016 award, which is his second such recognition by the Lean Enterprise Institute, with the first coming in 2009. And in August Y e Shi also received her second award as Lean Accounting Student of the Y ear, with the first coming in 2013. These national awards recognize excellence in developing and researching the field of lean accounting. In addition, Dr. Bargerstock published a book with Business Expert Press that explains how to connect planning and implementation. Coauthored with Jahn Ballard and entitled Mastering Leadership Alignment: Linking V alue Creation with Cash Flow, his book describes how to use value chain analysis, employee engage - ment, and well-chosen financial metrics to connect business planning with imple - mentation.Recognition 30 | MAHARISHI UNIVERSITY OF MANAGEMENT30 | MAHARISHI UNIVERSITY OF MANAGEMENTACHIEVEMENTS - FACUL TY Research Two studies find Transcendental Meditation helps prisoners T wo studies led by Professor Sanford Nidich, director of MUM's Center for Social and Emotional Health, and published in The Permanente Journal found that the Transcendental Med-itation technique helps prisoners deal with stress. A 2016 study on male in-mates at two Oregon prisons found 47% reduction in trauma symptoms after four months of practicing Transcendental Meditation. Trauma is associated with higher rates of recidivism (return-ing to prison) and a range of mental and physical health maladies, including cardio - vascular disease. And a 2017 study on female inmates in Oregon again found a sig-nificant reduction in trauma symptoms. The latter study is the first to be focused spe - cifically on female inmates with high levels of trauma symptoms. Andy Bargerstock and Y e Shi win national accounting awards Professor Jim Shrosbree receives prestigious art fellowshipProfessor Gyan Shrosbree exhibits widely Art faculty member Gyan Shrosbree is cementing her reputation as an artist with a half-dozen individual and group shows around the country. Her work, which is rooted in painting but uses a wide variety of materials, was exhibited at the Y el- low Door Gallery in Des Moines. The exhibit included work by her father, Jim Shrosbree, and high-lights their relationship as artists, colleagues, and family members. She also exhibited at Grapefruits in Portland, Oregon, ArtStart in Rhinelander, Wisconsin, W estern Exhibitions in Chicago, Haus Col - lective in San Antonio, T exas, and Ripon College in Ripon, Wiscon - sin. Ms. Shrosbree was also a res-ident artist at the prestigious T wo Coats of Paint in New Y ork. Her residency was supported by a grant from the W ege Foundation. Studies show IA Assembly reduced homicides, violent crime, and more Three additional published studies by Trustee Mi- chael Dillbeck and Emeritus Professor Ken Cavanaugh found great ben-efits from group practice of the Transcendental Meditation and TM-Sidhi programs in the Domes. These studies are on the effects of the Invincible America Assembly during the period 2007-2010 when it had reached the Super Radiance number for the U.S. The first study, published in the spring of 2016, found a 21.2% reduction in homicide and 18.5% reduction in violent crime during this period. A second study, published in ear - ly 2017, found that during this period there was a reduction of 20.6% in the rate of US motor vehicle fatalities and a 13.5% reduction in the rate of all other accidental fatalities during the same experimental period. The third study in the series, published in March, found that drug-related deaths fell by 30.4%. The fourth study, also published in March, found a 28.4% reduction in the murder rate in 206 large U.S. urban areas. Dr. Travis publishes studies on effects of meditation and Vedic recitation on the brain Professor Fred Travis continued to explore the effects of the Tran- scendental Meditation technique and V edic recitation on the brain, publishing three stud - ies that give greater insight into the nature of transcendence. A study on MUM students published in Brain and Cognition showed EEG patterns of the Transcendental Meditation technique that distinguish it from other approaches to meditation and that validate the assertion that it's an effortless practice. The study was titled \"Default mode network activation and Transcen-dental Meditation practice: Focused attention or automatic self-transcending?\" Dr. Travis was a coauthor on a second study, published in Cognitive Processing , that found that certain EEG patterns were lower in Transcendental Meditation and higher during mind wandering, effectively distinguishing the practice from the common subjective experience of mind wandering, which is more caught up in internal experience than during transcending. In addition, a study led by Dr. Travis and published in Consciousness and Cognition found that listening to live V e - dic recitation by pandits is not only typically associated with experiences of deep inner silence, but also is associated with coherent brain wave patterns.Dr. Michael Dillbeck Dr. Ken Cavanaugh Dr. Sanford Nidich Dr. Fred TravisMOTOR VEHICLE FATALITY RATE 2002-2010UNIVERSITY REPORT 2016-2017 | 33 32 | MAHARISHI UNIVERSITY OF MANAGEMENTACHIEVEMENTS - STUDENTS Films by students in the David Lynch Graduate School of Cinematic Arts won a number of major awards this past year.

In addition, 2016 graduate Agnes Baginska screened her 30-min-ute movie \"Last Tree S t a n d i n g \" at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival in France. Her film was part of the Short Film Corner, which features short films with artistic values. \"Last Tree Standing\" is a fairy tale set against a dystopian backdrop that follows the story of a young girl named Lexie who befriends a magical creature who is half-man, half-tree.In February 2017 a team of MBA accounting students finished in the 99th percentile in the CAPSIM on- line business simulation that included over 1,100 master's-degree-level teams worldwide, including teams from Indi - ana University, Kansas State, T emple University, University of Georgia, and California State. The teams act as executives who plan strategies and implement tactics across eight years of business activi- ties. Also, in July 2017 an MUM team finished in the 92nd percentile. Since 2011, MBA accounting students have consistently finished in the top 10th percentile, including three first-place finishes.Student Chas Zachar was among the 10% of applicants accepted into Teach for America for 2017, a national pro- gram that recruits teachers to work in underserved areas. Starting the fall of 2017 he is co-teaching high school classes in science, math, and English on the Big Island of Hawaii, with a special focus on supporting students with mild to moderate learning dis-abilities. He is also enrolled in a part-nering graduate program and will earn a master's degree in education. He said that it's also competitive to get placed in Hawaii. \"Having MUM on my resume makes me stand out,\" he said. \"There's been a movement toward different ways of educating. The core principles of Consciousness-Based education are becoming more mainstream and ac-cepted.\" MUM intern student Ama - rbayar (Amar) Amarsanaa, who has been working for Amazon as part of his curric - ular practical training in the Computer Pro - fessionals program, was named \" Asso - ciate of the Month\" in recognition of his contribution to, and impact on, one of the software development engineer teams he was supporting.

She and classmate Eric Salisbury applied principles of lean management to create greater efficiency. This entailed a multi-step approach of observation, mapping process flow, identifying waste, determining ways to measure the efficiency of the process, and creating a new map of the process that focuses on the value to the cus-tomers - who in this case are the students receiving financial aid. For the seventh time, members of the MUM running club won the timed-team competition at Ottumwa's annual 5-kilometer Komen Race for the Cure. The overall timed-team compe - tition consists of the cumulative time of a team's top five runners, with the MUM team finishing with a time of 1:55 - over 25 minutes faster than second-place Ottumwa Com-munity Schools, which had a time of 2:21. In addition, the club also won seven first-place age-group awards, one sec-ond-place age-group award, and six third-place age-group awards. Those who helped the team win the timed team award were Vinodthan Nayagar, Nayagar.Student research on value of exercise presented at Knowledge Fair After a second-place finish in a regional mediation tourna - ment on campus, a team of MUM students traveled to a national tournament in Arlington, T exas, where they were one of only four teams to qualify for the semi-finals in both the mediator category and the advocate/client category. The team of T al Ron (from Israel), Mirah Dumasia (from New Zealand), and Almar Meijles (from the Netherlands) took seventh place in both categories at the National Un-dergraduate Mock Mediation tournament sponsored by the International Academy of Dispute Resolution. MUM was by far the smallest school in the tournament, competing in the semi-finals against much larger universities, such as the University of T exas.Management, Mediation, Athletics Knowledge Fair Benefits of aerobic activity and meditation Jordan W allace was curious. She knew that the Transcen- dental Medita - tion technique was associated with coherent Alpha1 brain waves, but she wondered whether exercise might somehow en- hance that effect. So during her course on EEG with Professor Fred Travis she did a two-week study - and won second place and $200 when she pre - sented her research at MUM's annual Knowledge Fair. Her study was small, but intriguing. She had six subjects, three of whom participated in regular aerobic physi-cal activity and three who didn't. The results showed a visible increase in coherence in the athletic group. The study also suggested that the athletes simply had more neurons participating in the Alpha1 coherence. All of the subjects practiced both the Transcendental Meditation and TM-Sidhi programs. Jordan concluded that the combination of aerobic activity and practice of the Transcendental Medita - tion and TM-Sidhi program increases the potential of coherence and holistic brain functioning during activity. Each year, graduating students have the opportunity to present a fi-nal project and win a cash prize in the Knowledge Fair competition, which celebrates the knowledge, creativi-ty, and reasoning skills students have gained. They demonstrate this knowl- edge through a PowerPoint presenta - tion and a discussion during which the student responds to questions from an external panel of judges. The quality of presentations has been extremely high in recent years. Insights from art and music Winning first place this year, and $300, was art student Lennen Sanchez. His presentation reflected the relation - ship between himself, his artistic pro - cess, and being a practitioner of the TM-Sidhi program. He described the alignment of his understanding and exploration of the absolute/transcen-dental field and how that has an effect on his creativity. And he described how it illuminates the two necessary ques-tions that pull him forward: What else needs to be explored? And, what hap - pens next? Sharing third place were Sarah Dre - ben and Almar Meijles, who each re -ceived $100. Sarah discussed the role that music plays in the universe and in her life. She told about singing as an infant even before she was able to talk and then went deeply into Maharishi's comments on music and V edic melo - dies. And she played an audio of a song she had recently recorded. Affordable Vastu homes Almar, a business student, presented his business plan related to develop - ing small, affordable Maharishi V astu homes that are \"net-zero,\" meaning that they use renewable energy sources to produce as much energy as they con-sume. He gave extensive detail on the housing market and the need for more housing in Fairfield, showing how his proposed development would meet that need. During the discussion, one of Fairfield's most prominent devel - opers indicated an interest in working with Almar, as did Fairfield Mayor Ed Malloy.Student presents on \"Lean Process\" at Chicago conference Students place in national mediation tourneyMUM running club wins Ottumwa race Tal Ron, Mirah Dumasia, and Almar MeijlesJordan Wallace Meijles concludes his while Lennen Sanchez, Sarah Dreben, and Jordan Wallace applaud.UNIVERSITY REPORT 2016-2017 | 37ACHIEVEMENTS - MAHARISHI SCHOOL WINS TOP AW ARDPranav Chhalliyil It's fair to say they were impressed with this young scientist who is doing origi-nal research on oral hygiene. What was the occasion? It was the 2017 BioGENEius Challenge in San Diego, an international competition that included the top 15 students from the U.S., Canada, and Germany. Pra - nav qualified for the competition (all expenses paid) by winning the BioGE - NEius Challenge earlier in the year at the State Science and T echnology Fair of Iowa. Explains oral hygiene research in 60 seconds At the international level, the BioGE - NEius Challenge included the Gene Pool competition, their version of the hit TV show \"Shark T ank.\" It's a \"fast pitch\" format during which these next-generation scientists have just 60 seconds to explain to the judges and audience who they are, the problem their research solves, and why the rest of the world should care. Pranav's pitch was judged to be one of the top three, qualifying him for the final round of judging. This time the format was a two-minute presentation along with a question-and-answer ses-sion. It was during this round that Pra - nav's charisma impressed the judges. \"I answered all their questions and was able to connect to the common man, to take my project to an entrepreneur - ial level, and to convince them that my product is equal to the top oral cleaning brands, like Colgate and Pepsodent.\" The judges described him as charis- matic and presented him with the top award in Gene Pool. Gene Pool encourages students to seize opportunities for getting their re - search story in front of audiences - from peers to parents, strategic partners to investors - and using their communi- cation skills to highlight the true value of their research. It requires business savvy and the ability to effectively com-municate research value, both of which are crucial in the biotechnology indus- try. Pranav also did well in the other part of the competition: the Global Health Care Challenge, a poster presentation. He was the national winner and an in-ternational finalist. \"The BioGENEius Challenge was an amazing experience for me,\" Pranav said. \"I enjoyed sharing my project and also making good friends and contacts.\" The BioGENEius Challenge is a part of the Bio Convention, which brings together 16,000 biotechnology leaders. at International BioGENE ius Challenge\"I was honored to present to them and meet them. I was able to get a lot of in-ternship opportunities and help for my business. I also stood on stage in front of these 16,000 leaders for the keynote address.\" Alternative methods to avoid dental plaque Pranav's oral hygiene research found that the simple Ayurvedic method of rubbing one's teeth and gums with a finger and swishing water after every meal, drink, or snacks is a practical way to prevent formation of the den-tal biofilm that later matures as plaque and causes inflammation and disease. He used next-generation DNA se - quencing technology to see the entire oral microbiome in saliva, plaque, and tongue scrapes of 75 subjects. His study also found that brushing with nano charcoal is effective for den- tal hygiene because the nano pores ad- sorb many molecules that are needed to form biofilm. He found that com-mercial toothpaste is less effective in this regard and that his nano charcoal toothpaste doesn't cause dental abra - sion like some hard toothbrushes and toothpastes on the market. Pranav's success at the state science fair also qualified him for an all-ex-penses-paid trip to Los Angeles in May for the 2017 Intel International Science and Engineering Fair, which drew 1,880 students from 87 coun-tries. Competing against 90 other proj - ects, Pranav was awarded third place in the Microbiology category. Pranav's continuing success has been extraordinary. He was grand champion of the junior division at the state sci-ence fair as an 8th grader, grand cham-pion of the senior division as a 9th grader, and honorable mention grand champion this year as a 10th grader. A promotional video for the BioGE - NEius Challenge that includes photos of Pranav can be found online at goo.gl/D4ZRd5.A team of Maharishi School students showed their extraordinary creativi-ty by winning a first-place award at the Destination Imagination Global Fi- nals in Knoxville, T ennessee. Competing against 80 other teams, all of whom had qualified by winning at the state level, the team of Philip Winer, Drew Schoenfeld, Caleb Mullenneaux, Loreena Hansen, and Alista Wikle per - formed a musical they wrote that won not only first place but also a coveted Da Vinci Award for exceptional creativity. The 1,400 teams from 15 countries assembled at Knoxville competed in various age-level categories, and in one of six theme categories, ranging from building a machine to putting on an 8-minute play. The Maharishi School team competed in the senior division in the fine arts category, in which they were challenged to present a story about how the disappearance of a color changes the world. They came up with their own angle on the challenge, cre - ating a play about the disappearance of communism (long associated with the color red). Part of the play takes place in a communist setting, and part in a social Darwinist setting. They built a set on wheels that could be rotated between a plain communist background and a cityscape capitalist background. The play addressed the excesses of each system in a lighthearted way without making a clear political statement. The creativity exhibited in the concept and staging took their performance to a high level, but then to also make it into a musical put it over the top. At the substate competition, they simply had a 30-second musical interlude, which the audience really liked. So at the state competition, they did three of their eight minutes via musical performance, and again the audience liked that. In the weeks leading up to the global competition, they made the entire performance a musical - and ended up with a winning performance the au-dience loved. Their performance can be view online at goo.gl/MyHrkL. Charismatic. That's how the president of Johnson & Johnson and the president of the Biotechnology Institute described Maharishi School sophomore Pranav Chhalliyil. School team earns first place at W orld Creativity Competition 36 | MAHARISHI UNIVERSITY OF MANAGEMENTUNIVERSITY REPORT 2016-2017 | 39 38 | MAHARISHI UNIVERSITY OF MANAGEMENTACHIEVEMENTS - MAHARISHI SCHOOL Shristi Sharma wins honors at Eastern Iowa Science and Engineering Fair Middle School student Shristi Sharma won big at the 2017 Eastern Iowa Science and Engineering Fair with her project, How Easily Can Y our Password Be Hacked? Her research began with an interest in internet safety and security, and focused on how much a password's length affects the se - curity of online accounts. She hypothesized that with ev - ery numerical digit added, the time for a program that was guessing every single possible combination would increase exponentially. She then wrote a program in Python that used the brute force method to guess numerical passwords of 1-10 digits. She tested the program with passwords of each length (20 times each) and recorded the time it took for the program to guess the password. As the digits of the password increased, the time for the program to guess it increased as well. She concluded that using passwords with a minimum of eight digits improves cyber safety. Her project garnered a Class One Award for Junior Physi- cal Science, as well as a Broadcom MASTERS Outstanding Achievement Award. The Broadcom MASTERS (Math, Applied Science, T echnology, Engineering Rising Stars) Program is the pre - mier science and engineering competition for middle school students, and designates her entry as among the top 10% of middle school science fair projects in the U.S.The Maharishi School tennis team enjoyed a successful season, winning the singles, dou- bles, and team titles in the district compe - tition and sending their top singles play - er and doubles team to state. Kai Vessey made it to the final of the state singles tournament, defeating the #1 seeded player in his semifinal match. In the final, he lost to a foreign exchange student from the Czech Republic. Competing in doubles at the state tournament were Daniel Zhu and Devan Burke.Kai V essey earns second place at state tennis tourney The Maharishi School rocketry team finished fourth in the nation in this year's T eam America Rocketry Challenge, sponsored by Raytheon, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and others. Over 800 teams entered the competition. Their task was to design, build, and launch a rocket to go exactly 775 feet high and land in 41-43 seconds, with a payload of a raw egg intact. In spring 2017, the Maharishi School team's two qual- ifying flight scores earned them an opportunity to enter the national finals with the top 101 teams held in May in The Plains, V A. After a congressional reception on May 12, meeting a former astronaut, and seeing some W ashington, DC, sites, the team got down to work. The launch results would determine whether they made the cut of 24 finalists for the afternoon launches. Their rocket came within 12 feet of the target height and their landing time was almost per - fect. They were on to the final 24 fly-off round. Despite choosing to delay their second launch three times, when they finally ignited their rocket, it responded with an even better score than their first launch and was third best out of the 24 competitors. The combined scores for both flights earned them fourth place overall and $10,000 in col- lege scholarships, $1,000 for Maharishi School, and invi- tations to the 2018 NASA Student Launch at Huntsville, Alabama, where the competition target is 5,280 feet with a scientific payload. T eam members were Bridgit Bianco, Miles Falk, W ayne Li, and Karthik V empati, led by teacher Rick Rudloff.Rocket team finishes fourth in nation UNIVERSITY REPORT 2016-2017 | 57 56 | MAHARISHI UNIVERSITY OF MANAGEMENTLEGACY GIVING For over 40 years, Maharishi University of Management has been blessed and sustained by the extraordinary generosity of our supporters - those who un- derstand and appreciate Maharishi's vision and have committed to nurturing it across the years. As a direct result, our flagship institution has become a proud lighthouse of knowledge and coherence for the world. Many of us are now in a position to give back even more and play a key role in helping assure a foundational stability that will keep MUM strong and viable for many, many years to come. Why make a legacy gift? Legacy gifts are essential to the perpetuity of educational institutions such as MUM. Gifts can be made in several ways - through a bequest in a will, a charitable trust, life insurance, annuities, or retirement plans. In making your legacy gift, you will be ensuring that scholarships will continue to flow to worthy students. Y ou'll be helping MUM attract and retain the best faculty while providing the future with dynamic thinkers and leaders who will drive the causes you care most about, all of which depend upon maximizing human potential. Further, your gift will support Consciousness-Based educational princi-ples and methodologies, keep the physical campus vibrant, and preserve the knowledge of enlightenment that MUM's founder brought to the world.The time to explore these matters is now Legacy giving can also offer financial benefits: In many cases, heirs receive significant savings in es-tate taxes Y our gift costs nothing during your lifetime Some \"future gifts\" can be revocable and can be changed at any time There's no need to release any assets now (as long as it is not an annuity, life insurance, etc.) Many options for helping The following sections illustrate the many ways you can plan your gift. In-depth information is available at mum.giftlegacy.com or by contacting the MUM Development Office.Help the university that helps so manyBEQUEST IN A WILL A gift through a will is the most common source of legacy giving. A bequest can be a dollar amount or a percentage of your estate, or a gift of specific assets such as a residence, other real estate, a vehicle, artwork, or a coin collection.
