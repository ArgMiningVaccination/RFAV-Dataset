Spiritual coaching for addiction recovery is a therapy that helps individuals find a deeper connection with their spirituality. This type of therapy can be beneficial for those struggling with addiction, as it can lead to long-term recovery. We are a spiritually based treatment center, but spirituality is not synonymous with religion. While we do not advise our clients regarding religious matters, we always respect their religious beliefs. We are proponents of the 12-step program, so we believe it is possible to become and stay sober with the help of a higher power, whatever that higher power may be. A higher power can be anything an individual believes in and connects with, such as nature, the universe, or a higher being. The Four Agreements As part of our primary program curriculum, our clients read \"The Four Agreements,\" written by Don Miguel Ruiz The book, based on ancient Toltec wisdom, embodies some of the most important behavioral and spiritual principles necessary for lasting recovery, healthy relationships improved quality of life. When clients make these four agreements with themselves, they can let go of the things that do not serve them and experience freedom from addiction: - Be impeccable with your word - Speak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid speaking derogatorily against yourself and gossiping about others. Use the power of words only in the direction of truth and love. - Don't take anything personally - Nothing others do is because of you. What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream. When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won't suffer needlessly. - Don't make assumptions - Find courage to ask questions and to express what you really want. Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness, and drama. With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life. - Always do your best - Your best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick. Under any circumstances, simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse, and regret.
