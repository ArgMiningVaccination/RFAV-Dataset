Additionally, in the maintenance trial, 42% and 55% of patients treated with RINVOQ 15 mg and 30 mg achieved clinical remission at 52 weeks, respectively, compared to 14% of patients receiving placebo.1 \"Symptoms of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease can be disruptive and uncomfortable for patients, so relief as early as possible is key. Given the progressive nature of the disease, endoscopic response is just as important,\" said Edward V. Loftus, Jr., M.D., professor of medicine in the division of gastroenterology and hepatology at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota and U-EXCEL study investigator.* \"Based on the clinical trial results, treatment with RINVOQ shows both early and long-term symptom relief along with evidence of a visible reduction of damage to the intestinal lining caused by excess inflammation.\" \"I started feeling better within a couple weeks. My symptoms lessened - less cramping, firmer stools, and the bleeding stopped. When I stopped bleeding, I had more energy,\" said Danielle, who is living with Crohn's disease and received RINVOQ in an open-label treatment arm in one of the clinical trials. Rapid Clinical Response and Corticosteroid-free Clinical Remission1 - Onset of clinical response based on CDAI was observed as early as two weeks in U-EXCEED and U-EXCEL, with a greater proportion of patients achieving clinical response at week 2 in RINVOQ-treated patients compared with placebo.1 - This is the first clinical program of an approved moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease treatment to require steroid taper during the induction period, with a corticosteroid taper regimen initiated at week 4. Corticosteroid-free clinical remission (defined as discontinuation of steroid and achievement of clinical remission per CDAI [CDAI less than 150]) among patients on steroid at baseline was achieved at week 12 by more patients treated with RINVOQ in U-EXCEED and U-EXCEL (30% and 40%, respectively) placebo (11% and 13%, respectively). In U-ENDURE, corticosteroid-free remission (defined as no corticosteroids for 90 days prior to week 52 and achievement of clinical remission) was achieved by more patients treated with RINVOQ 15 mg and 30 mg (42% and 53%, respectively) compared to 14% with placebo. RINVOQ Safety Considerations1 - Overall, the safety profile observed in patients with Crohn's disease treated with RINVOQ was consistent with the known safety profile for RINVOQ in other indications. - RINVOQ may cause serious side effects, including: - Serious infections. RINVOQ can lower ability to fight infections. Serious infections, some fatal, occurred, including tuberculosis (TB) and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses. - Increased risk of death in people age 50+ with at least 1 heart disease risk factor. - Cancer and immune system problems. Increased risk of some cancers, including lymphoma and skin. Current or past smokers have higher risk for lymphoma and lung cancer. - Increased risk of major cardiovascular events such as heart attack, stroke, or death in people 50+ with at least 1 heart disease risk factor, especially in current or past smokers. - Blood clots, some fatal, in veins of the legs or lungs and arteries. This occurred more often in people 50+ with at least 1 heart disease risk factor. - Serious allergic reactions. Do not take if allergic to RINVOQ or its ingredients. - Tears in the stomach or intestines; changes in certain laboratory test results.

About Crohn's Disease Crohn's disease is a chronic, systemic disease that manifests as inflammation within the gastrointestinal (or digestive) tract, causing persistent diarrhea and abdominal pain.2-4 It is a progressive disease, meaning it gets worse over time, and in many cases leads to surgery.3,4 Because the signs and symptoms of Crohn's disease are unpredictable, it causes a significant burden on people living with the disease.5 About the U-EXCEED and U-EXCEL Induction and the U-ENDURE Maintenance Studies1,6-8 Phase 3 studies are multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of RINVOQ 45 mg as induction therapy and RINVOQ 15 mg and 30 mg as maintenance therapy in patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. Topline results of the U-EXCEED and U-EXCEL induction studies were announced in December 2021 and February 2022. Topline results of the U-ENDURE maintenance study were announced in May 2022.
