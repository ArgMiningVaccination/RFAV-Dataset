Progress made in the eld of molecular allergen characterization has now made it possible to produce dened vaccines for AIT and eventually forpreventive allergy vaccination based on recombinant DNA technology and synthetic peptide chemistry. Here we review the characteristics of recombinant and synthetic allergy vaccines thathave reached clinical evaluation and discuss how molecular vaccine approaches can make AIT more safe and effective and thus more convenient. Furthermore, we discuss how newtechnologies can facilitate the reproducible manufacturing of vaccines of pharmaceutical grade for inhalant, food, and venom allergens. Allergy vaccines in clinical trials based on recombinantallergens, recombinant allergen derivatives, and syntheticpeptides allow us to target selectively different immune mechanisms, and certain of those show features that might make them applicable not only for therapeutic but also for prophylacticvaccination. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2016;137:351-7.) Key words: preventive allergy vaccine Allergen-specic immunotherapy (AIT) was reported rst by Leonard Noon in 1911.1Noon injected grass pollen extract into allergic patients and, despite the occurrence of side effects,observed clinical improvement for almost 1 year in the treated patients. In his article Noon quotes earlier work by William Dunbar,2who had shown that anti-sera raised against pollen allergen extract could neutralize allergen-induced conjunctivalinflammation. The early work of Dunbar had already indicated that a major effect of AIT was caused by induction of allergen- specic blocking antibodies. In 1935, more than 40 years beforethe identication of IgE antibodies, Cooke et al 3reported a series of elegant experiments showing that allergen-specic IgG antibodies induced by AIT can suppress allergen-induced skininflammation. Since then, the importance of allergen-specicIgG antibodies that compete with IgE for binding to the allergens has been demonstrated by numerous studies as a major mechanism of the mode of action of AIT, 4and therefore one might consider AIT and in particular the traditional form of subcutaneous AIT as a therapeutic vaccine.5 There are several important features that suggest that AIT has many advantages over symptomatic treatment with anti- inflammatory drugs and biologics when applied as recommended according to guidelines.6First of all, AIT functions in an allergen- specic and thus causative manner as a therapeutic vaccine. Ituses the immune system of the patient to establish a counterim- mune response, antagonizing the allergic immune response by vaccination with the disease-causing allergens or derivativesthereof. Therefore, as with other vaccines, allergy vaccines can be relatively easily produced, and the costs of AIT are low, in particular when compared with those of treatment with biologicagents, such as anti-cytokine antibodies. 7Unlike anti- inflammatory treatment, AIT can stop the progression of mild forms (ie, rhinitis) of allergy toward severe forms (ie, asthma)and thus modies the natural course of disease. 8,9Furthermore, AIT has long-lasting effects, even after discontinuation of treat- ment, which cannot be achieved with symptomatic treatment.10 The achievement of long-term ''clinical tolerance'' can beachieved through induction of long-lived B cells or plasma cells secreting high-afnity antibodies 11and/or through a reduction in boosts of allergen-specic IgE, which occurs after naturalallergen contact. 12-14 Diagnosis of the disease-causing allergens and monitoring of treatment have been greatly facilitated through the availability ofmolecular allergy diagnosis, also termed component-resolvedFromathe Division of Immunopathology, Department of Pathophysiology and Allergy Research, Center for Pathophysiology, Infectiology and Immunology, andbthe Depart- ment of ENT, Medical University of Vienna.

In this review we will discuss how these bottlenecks have been ad- dressed in the past with traditional technologies and how moderntechnologies of molecular treatment might lead to a breakthrough of AIT not only for global allergy treatment but also ultimately for allergy prevention. AREAS OF AIT THAT NEED IMPROVEMENT Fig 1 provides an overview of areas in which improvement of AIT is needed. Some of these areas (safety, efcacy, and conve- nience) are closely connected to each other. A major problem in AIT is that administration of allergens can induce side effects inpatients, which, in the worst-case scenario, can lead toanaphylactic shock and death. 20Side effects can be classied as immediate side effects, which are caused by allergen-induced cross-linking of mast cell- and basophil-bound IgE antibodies.These side effects occur within 30 minutes after administration of the vaccine and, when induced systemically, can give rise to life-threatening anaphylactic shock. Systemic activation of mastcells and basophils occurs mainly when relevant doses of IgE-reactive allergens are distributed systemically in the body. A reduction in the risk of immediate systemic side effects can be achieved by keeping allergens locally bound at the application site, such as through the use of certain adjuvants, such as aluminum hydroxide, which has been introduced already in1935 and led to a profound reduction of severe systemic sideeffects ( Fig 2 ). 21Another way to reduce side effects has been reduction of the IgE reactivity of allergen extracts, which in the past has been achieved by chemical modication, such as denatur-ation with aldehydes. 22Such ''allergoids'' ( Fig 2 ). Interestingly, even strong reduction of IgE reactivity cannoteliminate side effects because late-phase side effects can occur even in the absence of IgE reactivity caused by the presence of un- destroyed T-cell epitopes. In a classical study it has been shownthat even non-IgE-reactive T-cell epitope-containing allergen peptides can induce systemic late-phase side effects that occur af- ter hours and are caused by IgE-independent activation ofallergen-specic T cells. 23Late-phase side effects have been also reported for AIT with allergoids made from natural allergen extracts.24,25Because the IgE reactivity of allergoids is usually strongly reduced, these late-phase side effects can be alsomediated by activation of allergen-specic T cells because allergoids retain their ability to stimulate T cells. 26 Another possibility to reduce the risk of side effects is to begin treatment with very low doses and to continuously increase the dose until a therapeutically effective maintenance dose has been reached. As a result of the need for updosing, AIT requiresmultiple administrations, which make the treatment inconvenient. Therefore alternative routes of administration, such as sublingual, oral, and epicutaneous application, were developed, but thesetreatments also require frequent administration and areinconvenient. 27-30For example, sublingual treatment requires daily administration, and therefore it is not surprising that the compliance of patients receiving AIT is low and particularlylow for sublingual AIT. 31 Another area of AIT in which improvement is needed is clinical efcacy. Very often it is not possible to reach and maintain thetherapeutically active dose in patients because of side effects. FIG 1. Requirements for improved allergy vaccines. FIG 2. Steps toward improvement of allergy vaccines.J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL FEBRUARY 2016352VALENTA ET ALNatural allergen extracts contain a variety of allergens with widely varying potency in different quantities. Several studies have shown that natural allergen extracts from different manufacturers contain widely varying contents of allergens andthat often important allergens are lacking. 32-34It is also known that individual allergens possess varying immunogenicity (ie, ability to induce IgG responses). For example, certain grass pollenallergens induce high IgG responses (eg, Phl p 5), whereas othersinduce only low or no IgG responses (eg, Phl p 2 and Phl p 1). 12,35,36Accordingly, allergen extract-based forms of AIT can induce only partial protection. This brings us to the majorbottleneck for the further development of AIT, which is related to the use of natural allergen extracts as a source for manufacturing the vaccines. The huge variations regardingamounts, potencies, and immunogenicity of individual allergen molecules in natural allergen extracts cannot be controlled or even manipulated by pharmaceutical production processes.Also, modern technologies, such as proteomics tools or massspectrometry, do not allow the adequate quantication of immunogenic allergens or allergen derivatives in extracts. 34 Therefore one cannot expect any further substantial improvement of AIT based on traditional allergen extract-based forms of treatment.37Requirements for innovative forms of AIT are summarized in Fig 1 and include high safety. The vaccine should have no anaphylactic potential and induce as few systemic late-phase side effects as possible. AIT vaccines should be effective and induce suppression of clinical symptoms early afterthe start of the treatment and should have sustained effects, even after discontinuation of the treatment. It should be possible to achieve the therapeutic effect with few doses of application toincrease patient compliance. Manufacturing of the vaccine mustbe reproducible and follow the pharmaceutical requirements set for vaccines and should be possible at low costs. The technology used for the production of the vaccine and the resulting vaccinesshould be applicable for all allergen sources, including respiratory, food, and venom allergens. Finally and importantly, it has become clear that one of the big advantages of AIT is that it can prevent the progression of mild to severe forms of allergy. It has been shown that AIT can prevent the progression of rhinitis to asthma when given in children. 8,9Through analysis of the evolution of IgE responses in early childhood with microarrayed allergen molecules in birth cohorts, it seems to become possible to predict the transition of silent andasymptomatic IgE sensitization toward the development of allergicsymptoms. 38-41Accordingly, one might consider applying AIT already to children who are sensitized but do not yet have symptoms to prevent the development of allergic symptoms oreven as early intervention to prevent the development of allergic sensitization. 42In fact, we are beginning to see the rst studies that make an attempt toward prophylactic AIT.43-45However, it will be necessary to have innovative AIT technologies that selectively induce protective IgG responses and/or tolerance without inducing and/or boosting IgE responses for preventive AIT. HOW MOLECULAR APPROACHES CAN CONTRIBUTE TO IMPROVEMENT OF AIT In this article we focus on dened molecular approaches for improvement of specic immunotherapy, which are based on puried recombinant allergens, recombinant allergen derivatives,and allergen-derived peptides. Problems associated with the badquality of natural allergen extracts can be overcome by the use of puried recombinant allergen molecules, which can be produced in reproducible quality according to pharmaceutical require- ments. Fusion of several allergens or of hypoallergenic allergenderivatives in the form of hybrid molecules allows for combining several allergens within one molecule and increasing the immunogenicity of the individual components. 35,46 In a classical study Pauli et al47have demonstrated that rBet v 1 was equally effective as birch pollen extract for subcutaneous AIT of patients with birch pollen allergy. However, rBet v 1 retains the allergenic properties of nBet v 1, and therefore patients had to betreated with a rather inconvenient updosing schedule and monthly maintenance injections in this trial. To increase the safety of AIT based on rBet v 1, tablet formulations of rBet v 1 for sublingualtreatment are currently being developed that use pharmaceutical grade recombinant allergen, 48but sublingual treatment will require multiple administrations and therefore remains aninconvenient form of treatment. It is also possible that sublingualapplication of rBet v 1 will induce oral allergy syndrome as a possible side effect. Finally, SLITwith rBet v 1 can strongly boost allergen-specic IgE production, as was observed for grass pollenallergen extract-containing tablets. 30 Currently available data for recombinant birch pollen and recombinant grass pollen allergens thus suggest that recombinantallergens can replace natural allergen extracts. 47,49,50They offer the advantage of being pharmaceutically well-dened allergens that can be easily produced, but side effects will remain similaras for natural allergen extracts. In addition, it will not be possible to reduce the numbers of treatments, and treatment will remain as inconvenient as for allergen extracts. Furthermore, recombinantwild-type allergens boost allergen-specic IgE production andtherefore might not be suitable for preventive vaccination. One possibility to reduce side effects is the genetic engineering of recombinant hypoallergenic allergen derivatives or the chemicaldenaturation of recombinant allergens. For genetic engineering, many different approaches, such as production of recombinant allergen fragments, mutated allergens, and mosaic approaches,have been used. 51These modications aim to reduce IgE reactivity and retain T-cell epitopes. The rst immunotherapy trial with recombinant allergen derivatives has been carried out withrecombinant fragments of rBet v 1 and a rBet v 1 trimer. 13The outcome was that this treatment showed efcacy, induced allergen-specic blocking IgG antibodies, reduced boosts of IgEproduction caused by seasonal allergen exposure, and eliminatedIgE-mediated immediate side effects. Furthermore, because of the hypoallergenic nature of the vaccine, higher doses were toler- ated by the patients. However, it was noted that hypoallergenicallergen derivatives induced systemic late-phase side effects in a considerable number of patients. 52A detailed analysis of the poten- tial mechanism underlying the late-phase side effects of the rBet v 1fragments was then performed by using atopy patch testing, and it seems that the late-phase side effects are IgE independent and mediated by T cells. 53A recent atopy patch test study that used hypoallergenic rBet v 1 fragments in patients with birchpollen-induced rhinoconjunctivitis revealed that late-phase, T cell-mediated side effects are quite common in birch pollen- sensitized patients. 54In agreement with this result is the nding that subcutaneous AIT with Bet v 1-derived long T-cell epitope- containing peptides (AllerT; Anergis, Epalinges, Switzerland), a treatment that is very similar to the rst AIT with rBet v 1fragments, frequently caused late-phase systemic side effects. 55J CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 137, NUMBER 2VALENTA ET AL events of late-phase dyspnea and 36 cutaneous late-phase reactions were observed when 75 injections were given.55It was also noticed that treatment with the hypoallergenic Bet v 1 peptides induced considerable (ie, 3-fold) increases of Bet v1-specic IgE antibodies. 55AIT with chemically denatured rBet v 1 was effective,56but it seems that the chemical denaturation of the recombinant allergen represented a difcult production step for thedevelopment of a pharmaceutically acceptable vaccine. In fact,chemical denaturation of allergen extracts and allergens yields high-molecular-weight aggregates, which cannot be easily manufactured in a reproducible manner, and the extent of thereduction of IgE reactivity can vary. 22 Recombinant hypoallergenic allergen derivatives of the major cat allergen Fel d 1 have been successfully used for intralymphaticAIT, 57,58and there are currently 2 clinical studies ongoing in which a recombinant hypoallergenic mutant of carp parvalbumin, mCyp c 1,59,60is used for subcutaneous AIT of sh allergy.61 The currently available data from clinical studies with recombinant or synthetic hypoallergenic allergen derivatives containing allergen-specic T-cell epitopes thus indicate that these derivatives induce blocking IgG antibodies and allowinjection of higher doses compared with wild-type allergens. Treatment with recombinant hypoallergens is clinically effective, and the risk of immediate allergic side effects can be reduced oreliminated. 13It also seems that hypoallergens can be produced for respiratory and food allergens and that this approach might be generally applicable. However, disadvantages of T-cellepitope-containing hypoallergens are that they can induce T cell-mediated late-phase side effects, and therefore updosing schedules are still needed. Furthermore, hypoallergens induceincreases in allergen-specic IgE production, and therefore theymight not be useful for preventive vaccination because they can induce allergic sensitizations or boost subclinical IgE sensitizations to become symptomatic. It is also not clear whetherit is possible to produce sufciently immunogenic and nonaller- genic derivatives by using recombinant technologies or synthetic peptide chemistry for all allergen sources. For example, it wasvery difcult to obtain recombinant hypoallergenic allergen derivatives comprising the 4 major timothy grass pollen allergens, 62and we are aware of only one report describing an IgG-inducing hypoallergenic derivative of the major house dust mite allergen Der p 1.63 Another approach for reducing the allergenic activity of AIT is the use of synthetic T-cell epitope-containing peptides derivedfrom major allergens with the aim to induce T-cell tolerance. Results of clinical trials performed with T-cell epitope peptides of the major cat allergen Fel d 1 indicate that the treatmentmight be clinically effective and that treatment effects can be long-lasting. 64-66Furthermore, this treatment requires only a few injections, and it seems that it has been possible to overcome theoriginally observed late-phase T cell-mediated side effects. 23 However, it is presently unclear what the immunologicmechanism of this treatment is because no induction ofallergen-specic blocking IgG has been observed because thepeptides are too short to induce IgG responses. Another challenge is that AIT with T-cell epitopes requires a large number of peptides to address MHC diversity in patients, particularlywhen several important allergens need to be covered by this approach. Furthermore, not all of the peptides are easy to manufacture and might present problems regarding solubilityand aggregation. Because T-cell epitope-containing peptides donot induce IgE sensitizations, they might well be suited for preventive treatment. 42 B-CELL EPITOPE-BASED ALLERGY VACCINES: A NEW KID ON THE BLOCK B-cell epitope-based allergy vaccines contain intrinsically non-IgE-reactive peptides of a length of approximately 20 to 40 amino acids, which are derived from the IgE-binding sites of the major allergens of a given allergen source.37,67-69To render these peptides immunogenic so that they induce a robust IgG anti- body response, which blocks IgE binding to the corresponding allergen, the peptides need to be covalently linked to a protein car-rier that is not related to the allergens and provides carrier-specic T-cell help ( Figs 2 and3). The rst proof-of-principle studies showing that it is possible to use carrier-bound allergen peptidesto induce allergen-specic IgG antibodies were made with allergen peptides from the major timothy grass pollen allergen Phl p 1 and from the major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1, whichwere chemically coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. 68,69It was found that these conjugates showed an even greater reduction of allergenic activity compared with recombinant hypo- allergens. Because of the fact that non-IgE-reactive peptides wereselected from the IgE-binding sites, it was possible to eliminate FIG 3. Schematic representation of the development of BM32, a recombi- a large extent. Thus B-cell epitope-based allergy vaccines were found to exhibit a strongly reduced potential to activate allergen-specic T cells and to induce proinflammatory cytokine production in PBMCs fromallergic patients. 70In a skin test study performed in patients with grass pollen allergy at the height of the grass pollen season, it was found that the B-cell epitope-based grass pollen allergyvaccine BM32 did not induce relevant IgE-mediatedimmediate-type skin reactions, and the reduction of allergen- specic T-cell epitopes in the vaccine rendered the vaccine negative in atopy patch testing. 71These results indicated that B-cell epitope-based allergy vaccines might have a reduced capacity to induce late-phase, T cell-mediated side effects, which was conrmed subsequently in clinical AIT studies(ClinicalTrials.gov nos. NCT01445002 and NCT01538979). Thus B-cell epitope-based vaccines appear to be more safe than vaccines based on recombinant or synthetic allergy vaccines,which contain allergen-specic T-cell epitopes. Chemicalcoupling viral particles was left 68,72,73and vaccines were produced as recombinant fusion proteins in Escherichia coli to yield dened products that are easy to manufacture in a reproducible and pharmaceutical grade. As carrier proteins, the viral proteins VP1 from human rhinovirus74and PreS from hepatitis B75were used, and it was found that the fusion proteins not only induced allergen-specic IgG responses on immunization but also virus-specic antibodies, which even had virus-neutralizing activities.76Thus it is quite possible that B-cell epitope-based allergy vaccines based on viral carrier proteins might offer an antiviral effect in addition to the AIT effect. An important feature of the B-cell epitope-based vaccines is that the use of a strongly immunogenic carrier allows induction of allergen-specic IgG antibodies also against allergens that intrinsically are poorly immunogenic and thus would induce apoor blocking IgG response when used as wild-type allergen. Furthermore, the selective inclusion of peptides from the IgE-binding sites allows us to better focus allergen-specic IgGresponses toward the IgE-binding sites of allergens, which might result in better protection. 77Because B-cell epitope-based allergy vaccines show a strongly reduced allergenic activity, it is possibleto inject high doses into patients. Together with the good immunogenicity of these vaccines, this indicates that only few (ie, approximately 3) injections per year will be needed fortreatment and that the vaccines would thus be extremelyconvenient for the patient. The concept of using the hepatitis B-derived capsid protein PreS as a carrier for B-cell epitope-based vaccines has been foundto be applicable to different allergens, 70,75,77,78and thus it appears that it will be possible to use the PreS-based technology for construction of vaccines for allergens from different sources,such as inhalant, food, and venom allergens. The analysis of serum samples from patients who have been treated with BM32, a grass pollen vaccine based on the B-cell epitope concept,has shown that the vaccine induces a allergen-specic IgG response (ie, IgG 15IgG 4> IgG 2) but does not boost allergen-specic IgE responses. Thus it is quite possible that B-cell epitope-based allergy vaccines can be used for preventivevaccination because they seem to have no IgE-sensitizing potential. Although the clinical relevance of AIT-induced IgE sensitizations has not been demonstrated, they might become apotential bottleneck for the application of AIT in a preventivesetting. In fact, we found that AIT with BM32, even when adsorbed to the T H2-driving adjuvant aluminum hydroxide, did not boost allergen-specic IgE responses. Indeed, experiments performed in mice indicate that immunization with B-cellepitope-based allergy vaccines might be useful to prevent allergic sensitization. 79 According to currently available in vitro , animal, and in vivo data from clinical studies, B-cell epitope-based vaccines haveseveral modes of action. The vaccines induce allergen-specic IgG antibodies that inhibit allergen-induced cross-linking of IgE on mast cells and basophils and thus immediate allergicinflammation. Furthermore, the IgG antibodies inhibit IgE-facilitated allergen presentation and thus will likely suppress also T cell-mediated allergic inflammation. Finally, it seems thatvaccine-induced IgG antibodies also reduce the boosts of IgE production induced by allergen exposure, and thus treatment might have a long-lasting effect because of a reduction inallergen-specic IgE levels. In summary, recombinant B-cell epitope allergy vaccines are the new kid on the block and hold great promise to profoundly improve AIT and become applicable also for preventive allergyvaccination.
