They follow different philosophy in curing diseases. Ayurveda believes in preventing diseases while homeopathy believes in curing a disease. Let us see how they differ from each other! Ayurveda: Ayurveda, which is originated in India more than 3500 years ago, is an alternate system of medicine. It is described in the Atharvaveda. The Charaka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita are the two foundational textbooks of Ayurveda that have survived from ancient India. The word Ayurveda is derived from two Sanskrit words \"Ayur\" meaning life and \"Veda\" meaning knowledge. So, Ayurveda means knowledge of life. Ayurveda gives emphasis on the balance between body, mind and soul for healthy living. It uses herbs and minerals to bring balance to the Body and Mind. It also gives emphasis on good digestion, proper excretion, exercise, yoga, meditation etc. Ayurveda believes that human body is made up of five elements: the earth (Prithvi), water (Jal), fire (Agni), air (Vayu) and space (Aakash). According to Ayurveda, there should be a harmony among the three elements in our body which include the Vat (wind), Pit (bile) and the Kaf (phlegm). A person falls sick if the balance amongst these three elements is disturbed. In Ayurveda, the medicines are prepared from herbs, vegetables and sometimes animal materials are also used. Homeopathy: Homeopathy is also an alternate system of medicine. The term homeopathy is derived from two Greek words: \"homoios\" meaning like and \"pathos\" meaning suffering. It is based on the principle that \"like cures like\", meaning the substance which can cause symptoms in a healthy person can be consumed in a small amount to cure a sick person with the same symptoms. Such substances which are used as homeopathic medicines trigger body's immune system to fight against the disease. This system of alternative medicine was created by Samuel Hanemann, a German physician, in the late 18th century. The homeopathic medicines are prepared by diluting parts of plants and vegetables, minerals and synthetic materials in distilled water or alcohol.
