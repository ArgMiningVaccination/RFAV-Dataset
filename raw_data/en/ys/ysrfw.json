This day is celebrated to mark the birth anniversary of Dr. Samuel Hahnemann, who is the founder of homeopathy. Dr. Samuel Hahnemann was a German physician who developed the principles of homeopathy in the late 18th century. He believed that \"like cures like,\" which means that a substance that causes symptoms in a healthy person can be used to treat similar symptoms in a sick person. He also believed in the use of highly diluted substances to minimize side effects and maximize the body's ability to heal itself. Today, homeopathy is a widely used alternative form of medicine that is practiced all over the world. Supporters of homeopathy believe that it can treat a wide range of conditions, from allergies and arthritis to depression and anxiety.History of homeopathy Hahnemann began experimenting with this idea in the late 1700s, and by 1796, he had published a book outlining his principles and practices of homeopathy. He believed that the conventional medical practices of the time, such as bloodletting and the use of toxic substances like mercury, were causing more harm than good, and that homeopathy offered a safer and more effective alternative. Homeopathy quickly gained popularity throughout Europe and spread to [North America](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/north-america) in the early 19th century. The first homeopathic medical school was established in the [United States](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/united-states) in 1835, and by the mid-1800s, there were more than 100 homeopathic medical colleges and 15,000 practitioners in the US alone. Despite its popularity, homeopathy was not without its critics. Many in the medical community dismissed it as quackery and questioned its scientific basis. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the rise of modern medicine and the development of antibiotics and other drugs led to a decline in the popularity of homeopathy. Today, homeopathy remains a controversial and divisive topic. Proponents argue that it is a safe and effective form of medicine, while critics point to a lack of scientific evidence supporting its efficacy and the potential risks of using highly diluted substances to treat serious illnesses.How it is observed On World Homeopathy Day, practitioners and supporters of homeopathy come together to raise awareness about the benefits of this alternative form of medicine.
