Ten years from now, doctors will enter nearly every patient encounter into some kind of digital system, and they will be expected to use data to improve their treatment. The latest data shows that more and more providers are adopting an electronic health record (EHR). The percentage of providers who have adopted an EHR in their practice has doubled from 17% to 34% between 2008 and 2011 (National Center for Health Statistics, National Ambulatory Medicare Survey, 11/30/11). The question is will this transformation actually improve health? The NYC Regional Electronic Adoption Center for Health (NYC REACH) is a collaboration between the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's Primary Care Information Project (PCIP) and the Fund for Public Health in New York to help make sure doctors in New York City don't get left behind. Our mission is to assist them in adopting technology and methods that measurably improve the health of New Yorkers. Drawing on the experience of the PCIP, NYC REACH has a team of experts for all stages of EHR adoption, implementation and use. A New York City mayoral initiative founded in 2005, PCIP succeeded in bringing over 1,800 providers live on EHRs and is now the largest community based EHR program in the country.

FORMAL INTERNSHIP PROGRAM Quality problems are reflected today in the wide variation in use of health care services, the underuse and overuse of some services, and misuse of others. Improving the quality of health care and reducing medical errors are priorities for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Every day, millions of Americans receive highquality health care that helps to maintain or restore their health and ability to function. However, far too many do not. Quality problems are reflected in a wide variation in the use of health care services, underuse of some services, overuse of other services, and misuse of services, including an unacceptable level of errors. A central goal of health care quality improvement is to maintain what is good about the existing health care system while focusing on the areas that need improvement. Improving the quality of care and reducing medical errors are priority areas for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). AHRQ is working to develop and test measures of quality, identify the best ways to collect, compare, and communicate data on quality, and widely disseminate information about the most effective strategies for improving the quality of care.

The National Environmental Health Association (NEHA) had its origins in the state of California where it was incorporated in 1937. The original impetus behind the creation of a national professional society for environmental health practitioners was the desire by professionals of that day to establish a standard of excellence for this developing profession. This standard, which has come to be known as the Registered Environmental Health Specialist or Registered Sanitarian credential, signifies that an environmental health professional has mastered a body of knowledge (which is verified through the passing of an examination), and has acquired sufficient experience, to satisfactorily perform work responsibilities in the environmental health field. The pioneers of the association believed that such a credential was necessary if the environmental health field was to grow and take shape as a legitimate and widely respected profession. Drawing on the original effort that led to the creation of NEHA, the association today stands as a strong professional society with over 4,500 members across the nation.

FORMALIZED INTERNSHIP PROGRAM The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA) mission is to reduce the impact of substance abuse and mental illness on America's communities. SAMHSA was established in 1992 and directed by Congress to target effectively substance abuse and mental health services to the people most in need and to translate research in these areas more effectively and more rapidly into the general health care system. Over the years SAMHSA has demonstrated that prevention works, treatment is effective, and people recover from mental and substance use disorders. Behavioral health services improve health status and reduce health care and other costs to society. Continued improvement in the delivery and financing of prevention, treatment and recovery support services provides a cost effective opportunity to advance and protect the Nation's health. To accomplish its work SAMHSA administers a combination of competitive, formula, and block grant programs and data collection activities. The Agency's programs are carried out through its many centers and offices (see website).

Ten years from now, doctors will enter nearly every patient encounter into some kind of digital system, and they will be expected to use data to improve their treatment. The latest data shows that more and more providers are adopting an electronic health record (EHR). The percentage of providers who have adopted an EHR in their practice has doubled from 17% to 34% between 2008 and 2011 (National Center for Health Statistics, National Ambulatory Medicare Survey, 11/30/11). The question is will this transformation actually improve health? The NYC Regional Electronic Adoption Center for Health (NYC REACH) is a collaboration between the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's Primary Care Information Project (PCIP) and the Fund for Public Health in New York to help make sure doctors in New York City don't get left behind. Our mission is to assist them in adopting technology and methods that measurably improve the health of New Yorkers. Drawing on the experience of the PCIP, NYC REACH has a team of experts for all stages of EHR adoption, implementation and use. A New York City mayoral initiative founded in 2005, PCIP succeeded in bringing over 1,800 providers live on EHRs and is now the largest community based EHR program in the country.

Public Health Law Research, a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation\u00ae program at Temple University, is a national initiative to promote effective regulatory, legal and policy solutions to improve public health. Laws have improved the public's health by affecting behaviors (such as promoting seatbelt use and immunizations) and environments (such as regulating exposure to lead and protecting communities from the spread of infectious diseases). Laws can enable the public to make healthy choices, and they give public health agencies the authority to respond to community needs in times of crisis. Laws and law enforcement practices can also have unintended negative effects on health. 34The Public Health Law Research program is dedicated to building the evidence base for laws that improve public health. We fund research, improve research methods, and make evidence more accessible to policymakers, the media, and the public.
