As a result, these disorders often affect many body systems, and most cannot be cured. However, approaches may be available to treat or manage some of the associated signs and symptoms. For a group of genetic conditions called inborn errors of metabolism, which result from genetic changes that disrupt the production of specific enzymes, treatments sometimes include dietary changes or replacement of the particular enzyme that is missing. Limiting certain substances in the diet can help prevent the buildup of potentially toxic substances that are normally broken down by the enzyme. In some cases, enzyme replacement therapy can help make up for the enzyme shortage. These treatments are used to manage existing signs and symptoms and may help prevent future complications. An example of an inborn error of metabolism is [phenylketonuria (PKU)](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/phenylketonuria/). For other genetic conditions, treatment and management strategies are designed to improve particular signs and symptoms associated with the disorder. These approaches vary by disorder and are specific to an individual's health needs. For example, a genetic disorder associated with a heart defect might be treated with surgery to repair the defect or with a heart transplant. Conditions that are characterized by defective blood cell formation, such as [sickle cell disease](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/sickle-cell-disease/), can sometimes be treated with a bone marrow transplant. Bone marrow transplantation can allow the formation of normal blood cells and, if done early in life, may help prevent episodes of pain and other future complications. Some genetic changes are associated with an increased risk of future health problems, such as certain forms of cancer. One well-known example is familial [breast cancer](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/breast-cancer/) related to mutations in the [BRCA1 ](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/brca1/)and [BRCA2 ](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/brca2/)genes. Management may include more frequent cancer screening or preventive (prophylactic) surgery to remove the tissues at highest risk of becoming cancerous. Genetic disorders may cause such severe health problems that they are incompatible with life. In the most severe cases, these conditions may cause a miscarriage of an affected embryo or fetus. In other cases, affected infants may be stillborn or die shortly after birth. Although few treatments are available for these severe genetic conditions, health professionals can often provide supportive care, such as pain relief or mechanical breathing assistance, to the affected individual. Most treatment strategies for genetic disorders do not alter the underlying genetic mutation; however, a few disorders have been treated with [gene therapy](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/therapy/genetherapy/). This experimental technique involves changing a person's genes to prevent or treat a disease. Gene therapy, along with many other treatment and management approaches for genetic conditions, are under study in clinical trials.
