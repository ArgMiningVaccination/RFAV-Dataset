Those who possessed knowledge were able to control the masses. People were subservient because they could not read and thus could not think for themselves. Nowadays, information is available everywhere. Since the start of this pandemic, many stories have been circulating on the internet. From conspiracy theories to the official versions released by the government, there is plenty of material to read. A physical quarantine does not necessarily mean a mental lockdown. Thirty-nine years ago, Dean Koontz, author of the bestselling novel The Eyes of Darkness, wrote the following: \"Li Chen defected to the United States carrying [...] China's most important and new biological weapon in a decade. They call the stuff: \"Wuhan-400\" because it was developed at their RDNA labs outside of the city of Wuhan.\" Renowned medium Sylvia Brown also predicted this pandemic twelve years ago: \"In around 2020 a severe pneumonia like illness will spread throughout the globe, attacking the lungs and the bronchial tube and resisting all known treatments. Almost more baffling than the illness itself will be the fact that it will suddenly vanish as quickly as it arrived, attack again ten years later, and then disappear completely.\" These anecdotes definitely present a controversial perspective on how we perceive reality. Is the future predictable, and how accurate can it be? Can we change the course of an event if we know the direction it is taking? Whether it was an intuitive inspiration or pure prophecy, they do pique our curiosity. Ongoing debates are happening today among medical experts. Many are defying the mainstream media. Some reports have said that the coronavirus started to spread in Italy and the UK as early as December 2019, before it was known in China (8). Others argued that the tests are flawed and the numbers of infected cases are exaggerated (9). Dr. Karin Molling, a German virologist compares the number of deaths every year due to the flu season: \"this winter, the flu is not severe, but around 80,000 people are infected. [commenting on the numbers of covid-19 cases] ...You don't get these numbers at all\" (3). Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi, an infectious disease specialist, explains his perspective on infected cases. Contrary to the general belief, he believes these numbers do not justify a global quarantine. His conclusion about this lockdown is quite firm: \"They are grotesque, absurd and very dangerous... all these measures are leading to self-destruction and collective suicide because of nothing but a spook\". (4). Dr. Shiva Ayadurai, candidate for the senate in Massachusetts, exposes the long-term plan involved in this crisis, including a cashless society and the mandatory vaccination agenda (5). There is no doubt vaccination has saved many lives in the past. However, there are also many cases of side-effects associated with vaccines. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the following ingredients are found in most vaccines: thimerosal (ethylmercury), aluminum salts, egg protein, formaldehyde, and fetal calf bovine serum, just to name a few (6). In 2001, thimerosal was taken out of childhood vaccines in the United States (7). The CDC claims there is no connection between thimerosal and autism (7). Yet, there is a growing concern in the population about vaccines. Vaccination may be the next challenge we will be facing soon. It fits perfectly well in this context and seems to be the next logical step to take. Vaccines can help seniors, the immunocompromised, and those who feel they may benefit from it. Side-effects are not always experienced. It depends on the individual. Scientists can debate over the rate of infection of covid-19. Not everyone has the expertise to argue. However, when it comes to a topic such as vaccination, the people will have to voice their opinion on this subject as all will be affected. Can the government impose mandatory vaccination? This society is quickly molding itself according to the latest changes. New laws are being created for our seeming protection. Public health is achieved at this point at a very high cost. A global economic crisis is pending if this quarantine lasts for too long. There are already a few anti-lockdown protesters marching in North America and Europe. There is no quick fix, and no one claims to have an answer. While most people are waiting for an authority to tell them what to do, there will be a time when it may no longer be relevant to do so. Again, what we do with the information that is given to us is crucial. It has an impact on our lives and our loved ones. This pandemic gives us an opportunity to reflect on our personal life and choices. It also sets the tone for how we will move forward as a society. All decisions, if coming from Ego or a place of fear and powerlessness, are most likely to be to our disadvantage. On the other hand, the outcomes will most likely be best when we are aligned with Source Energy. Like old friends reconnecting after a long separation, we must ask for this connection to be re-established. To borrow the words of Eckhart Tolle, we have to get in touch with that formless dimension that lives within each and every one of us. That Presence that has never been wounded, hurt, or traumatized (10). Spring is coming soon. There is a sense of renewal and liveliness that blossoms in Nature. Most of us are longing for that re-joining with the natural world. A similar reconnection is waiting for us on a spiritual level. To be awakened and aligned with the best version of who we are is the best gift we can give to ourselves and the planet. Come out of this lockdown rested and as healthy as you can. Focus on your wellbeing. Ask Source Creator for guidance and inner wisdom. Today, information from the outside world is more abundant than ever. Unfortunately, it is often contaminated and distorted. Inner work and self-reflection are necessary to allow discernment to flourish. Without time for reflection, media consumption is useless and meaningless. We all have a say in what happens on planet Earth. Vaccination is only one topic. There are many other challenges ahead of us. There will be a time when the choices that we make will have a weight and repercussions on global society. To make the best of this world, each decision will have to be informed, clear, and aligned with a benevolent Universe. It is also very likely that this time will come sooner than later. Then, based on those choices, will our future be revealed... if we still have a choice.
