We take as many precautions as possible to ensure your order arrives in tip-top shape in the warmest of weather, and ship with ice packs to areas experiencing hot weather. Please note the ice packs only protect the candles for approximately 24-48 hours. If you are experiencing warm weather where you live, please keep an eye on your tracking number. We highly recommend being home for delivery, or taking your package into a climate controlled area as soon as possible after delivery. "}
