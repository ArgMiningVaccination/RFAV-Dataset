Superfoods are popular for being full of phytochemicals or phytonutrients, an element primarily found in plants that can reduce the risk of cancer when consumed the right way. However, there is a wide range of phytochemical variants offering various health functions and benefits. As a result, you'll have to try out different types of superfoods to prevent cancer.

Consuming superfoods can help you deal with the effects of cancer and the treatment in a better way. To resolve this issue, consider choosing a variety of superfoods of different colors. Superfoods you should include in your diet to prevent cancer Superfoods are nutrient-dense and can help in keeping your body's defenses up. Here's a list of foods that are not only low in calories and fat but can also be effective in preventing different types of cancer: - Broccoli Broccoli is a green superfood that contains sulforaphane, which reduces the growth of breast and prostate cancer cells. Broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables like cabbage, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, and radishes can also lower the risk of colon and colorectal cancer. Additionally, broccoli also contains Indole-3 Carbinol, a compound that changes the rate of estrogen metabolism and reduces the risk of certain cancers, such as breast, cervix and prostate cancer. - Berries Berries are high in anthocyanins and antioxidants, which can reduce the risk of developing cancer. Blackberries and blueberries can help in inhibiting the growth of cancer cells and decreases the size of tumors in animals. Although there is no human research or test to back the effects of berries on cancer, eating a few berries can help in reducing the growth of cancer cells in your body. - Citrus fruits Studies have shown a lower risk of cancer associated with regular consumption of citrus fruits like oranges, limes, and lemons. These fruits can prevent cancer in the digestive and respiratory tracts. Three servings of these fruits per week can reduce the risk of stomach cancer by 28%. - Carrots Carrots have been linked to lowering the risk of different types of cancer. Consuming carrots regularly as a part of your meals can reduce the risk of stomach, prostate, and lung cancer, making it one of the most effective foods to reduce the risk of cancer. - Olive Oil Olive oil is loaded with health benefits, and when used in your cooking regularly, it can reduce the risk of cancer. Substituting your regular cooking oil with olive oil can reduce the risk of breast cancer and even colorectal cancer. Consider swapping other types of oil in your diet with olive to benefit from it optimally. You can use it in your salads and cooked veggies, or you could use it while cooking meat, fish and poultry. - Tomatoes Tomatoes are rich in lycopene. It is a carotenoid, a variant of phytochemical that can help in preventing the risk of cancer. Eating tomatoes daily can also slow down the growth of cancerous tumors and prostate cancer. It has also been found that people with high carotenoids have a lower chance of getting afflicted by lung and [breast cancer](https://www.adityabirlacapital.com/healthinsurance/active-together/2022/10/15/what-warning-signs-of-breast-cancer-can-help-detect-it-at-an-early-stage/). To get the maximum health benefits of tomatoes, one of the foods to prevent cancer, consider cooking them like it's pasta sauce. The intense heating period increases the amount of lycopene that is absorbed by your body. - Walnuts Walnuts are rich in certain chemical compounds like Omega-3 fatty acids, phytosterols and tocopherols. While phytosterols help in blocking the estrogen receptors in breast cancer cells, fatty acids and phytosterols can suppress the growth and survival of breast tumors. Consuming foods to prevent cancer and other superfoods can help reduce the risk of certain cancer types by providing you with rich nutrients. However, if you think you have symptoms of cancer, check in with your doctor immediately. Stay tuned to the Activ Living Community.
