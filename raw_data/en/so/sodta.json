CHAP. XLVII. Of Pains of the Teeth. THe Pain of the Teeth is occasioned by the Influx of Humours, which are either Cold, Flegmatick, Hot, Serous, Salt, or Acrid; Worms also bred in rotten Teeth occasions Pain, and some think that the Pain proceeds sometimes from Wind. The External and Procatarctick Causes occasioning Pain in the Teeth, are all those things which promote Fluxion of Humours; the chief whereof are cold Air, or Southerly Winds, standing long in the Heat of the Sun, or abroad in the Night, surfetting, and all Errors in Diet. To these add Rottenness of the Teeth, which weakens them and renders them more apt to receive Fluxions. The Diversity of the Causes may be known by various Signs, when the Pain arises from hot Humours it is very violent, the Constitution hot, the Age flourishing, it is Summer, there is great Heat in the Part, and often an Inflammation of the Gums, cooling Medicines give Ease; hot increase the Pain; But if the Pain arise from cold Humours, Signs contrary to these appear. If Worms are the Cause the Pain is by Intervals, and the Motion of the Worm is sometimes perceived in the Part. Pain is likewise produced by a Flatuous Spirit, which appears by the vehemency and tearing Pain which is felt in the Part, and which goes off in a little time, [Page 112](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/125:5.6?vid=65404) and is easily cured, by applying discutient Remedies to the place. The Prognostick is various according to the Variety of the Causes. A Pain which is occasioned by a hot, thin, or sharp, acrid and salt Humour, is the more vehement indeed, but sooner goes off, by reason of the sudden Changes of the Humours; that which proceeds from a cold and Flegmatick Humour, is more gentle but of longer Duration. A Tumour arising in the Gums or Jaws, eases the Pain of the Teeth, by reason that the Fluxion is carried to the exterior Parts; so that it falls no more upon the Cavity of the Teeth. As to the Cure, the Cause of the Pain must be taken away, and the Pain it self mitigated. And although Anodyns have no great Effect, unless the Fluxion be taken off, yet it is often so violent, that it must not only be mitigated with Anodyns, properly so called, but also with Narcoticks before the Cause be removed. Therefore the Humour which flows to the Teeth must be drawn back, evacuated and repelled; that which is already flown in, must be discussed and carried off by Derivation. First therefore, If the Pain arise from hot Humours, Bleeding must be used in the Arm of the same Side, whereby a Revulsion of the Humour may be made; but if the Pain proceeds from cold Humours, Bleeding is not so proper, but by reason of the Fluxion it may be used because it principally makes Revulsion; but a small quantity of Blood must be taken away, unless the Signs of a Plethora appear; for in that case large Bleeding may be allowed, which is the best means to ease the Pain in the Teeth, and all other Pains. The next Day some purging Medicine must be given, that is proper for the peccant Humour; afterwards if the Pain continues, Cupping-glasses with Scarification must be applied to the Shoulders, or a large Cupping-glass without Scarification; a Blister may be applied to the Neck or behind the Ears, for it draws powerfully the Humours backward. And to stop the Flux Astringents are properly applied to the Temples; such are the Plaisters of Gum-elemi, of Mastich alone, or ad Herniam. [Page 113](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/126:5.6?vid=65404)The fresh Roots of Comfrey, bruised and applied to the Temples are excellent for stopping of Fluxion, also the Powder, of Allum and Galls made into a Plaister with Pitch are very effectual. Riverius, chief Physician to Henry the Great, kept the following Plaister as a great Secret. Take of Pine-nuts, and red Roses, of the Seeds of Cresses torrified, of Mastich, and seal'd Earth, each one dram and an half, infuse them in Rose Vinegar twenty four Hours, afterwards dry them, and add of Opium dissolved in Aqua Vitae three ounces, of Ship Pitch and Colophony, each one Ounce, of Yellow Wax melted in the Oyls of Henbane, and white Poppies, by Expression a sufficient quantity, make a Plaister, which must be applied to the Arteries and pained Part. Medicines also are put into the Ears for Pain in the Teeth, because the Arteries which nourish the Teeth do pass by the Ears; upon that account, Oyl of bitter Almonds is put into the Ear next to the Tooth affected, also a Suffumigation of Vinegar, in which Penyroyal, or wild Marjoram hath been boiled, is often used. Vinegar is also dropt into the Ear, by which the Fluxion is powerfully stopped, and it is most effectual in a hot Fluxion. But in a hot Fluxion, Juice of Garlick mixed with Venice Treacle, and dropt warm into the Ear, mitigates the Pain powerfully: Also the Root of Garlick, the Bark being taken off, and made in the form of a Suppository, and put into the Ear, produces the same Effect. Astringents are also applied in the beginning of the Fluxion, and they ought to be cold if the Matter be hot; but if it be cold, hot Medicines mixed with those that are repelling are to be used; in whatever Cause, if the Pain be violent, Anodyns are to be mixed with Discutients. To which Purpose the following Medicine may be prescribed. Take of the Roots of Cinquefoil, Bistort, Tormentill, each one dram, of the Leaves of Vervain, Plantain, and Mullein, each one handful, Cypress-nuts, Galls, and Cups of Acrons, each two drams, of red Sanders, a dram [Page 114](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/127:5.6?vid=65404) and an half, of red Roses, and Balaustines, each one pugil, boil them in astringent Wine and Vinegar, fomeri the pained Part with this Decoction frequently. This Decoction may be used in the beginning of a hot Fluxion, in a cold one you may add the Roots of Cyperus, the Bark of Box-wood, Ivy-leaves and the like. A more Simple Medicine may be prepared of Plantain, and Rose Water, with a little Vinegar, after the manner of an Oxycrat. Or the Teeth must be washed with a Decoction of Galls in Vinegar. Or, Take of Cinquefoil-roots half an ounce, of Willow-leaves half an handful, boil them in astringent Wine, and wash the Mouth with the Decoction. This Decoction stops the Fluxion, and eases Pain. After that these Remedies have been used which mitigate the Pain, and discuss the Cause of it, of which there are a great Number proposed by Authors, and also by the common People. We shall in the next Place propose those that are more effectual; of the which such Choice is to be made, that these which not only resolve, and discuss, but also stop the Flux, being mixed with astringents, in the beginning and increase of the Disease, those which only discuss in the Height and Declination. Take of the Juice of House-leek, and Night-shade, each two ounces, of Cow or Sheeps-milk, eight ounces, Oyl of Roses, Omphacin, one ounce and an half, of OpiUm and Saffron, each three grains, mix them and apply a Rag dipt in the Liquor warm often to the Jaws where the pained Tooth is. Or, Take of the Pap of sweet Apples boiled two ounces, of Bra infused in Vinegar, three ounces, Oyl of Roses, Omphacin one Dram, Saffron half a scruple, of Opium two grains, mix them and make a Cataplasm to be applied to the part affected. Or, Take of wheaten and Bean-flower, each three ounces, of Oyl of Roses compleat, and of sweet Almonds, each half an ounce, of the Juice of the greater House-leek an ounce [Page 115](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/128:5.6?vid=65404) and an half, of Milk a sufficient quantity, make a Cataplasm, to be often applied warm to the Part affected. Or, Take the Whites of two Eggs, beat them with Rose-water, with Rags whereon two drams of Pepper powdered has been sprinkled, apply them over the whole Cheek affected. Nevertheless it is carefully to be noted, that Astringents be not applied to the Jaws if they be tumified, least the Humour be repelled back, and should suffocate the Patient. Cotton dipt in Oyl of Cloves, and put into the Hollow Tooth is frequently used to ease the Pain, Oyl of Box also does the same. But if the Pain be so violent that it cannot be quelled with the foresaid Remedies, we must use Narcoticks, which may be applied to the pained Tooth, but they most certainly give Ease being taken inwardly; you may give three or four grains of the London Laudanum, it gives ease and stops the Fluxion. Take of Opium, Mirrh, and Labdanum, each one Dram, powder them, and boil them in Whitewine to the Consistance of a Liniment, mix Cotton with it, and stop the Hollow Tooth. If Worms are in the Teeth, they must be killed by bitter things. Take of Aloes one Dram, of Champhor ten Grains, of Aqua Vitae half a dram, mingle them, and apply them to the Teeth with Cotton, It is to be noted, that there is seldom a Pain in the Teeth, unless they are Hollow, and untill they are eaten through to the Nerve; wherefore that the Pain may be taken off, the Nerve must be burnt, either with an actual Cautery, or with Aqua fortis, or Oyl of vitriol put into the Cavity. But if notwithstanding all these means the Pain continues, the Tooth must be drawn, but care must be taken [Page 116](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/129:5.6?vid=65404) that the Tooth be not drawn when the Fluxion rushes violently upon it, or when the Headach accompanies it; or the Gums are swelled, and when the Pain is violent; and the Tooth-drawer must be admonished, that he does not pluck it out violently at once, least a concussion of the Brain shou'd follow, or the breaking of the Jawbone, upon which violent Bleeding, a Feaver, and sometimes Death comes. As soon as the Tooth is drawn, the Part from whence it is taken must be pressed on every side, that it may be restored to its natural State, afterwards let the Sick wash his Mouth with warm Oxycrat, and let him be careful least he catch cold, whereby a new Fluxion may fall upon other Teeth. But if Blood flow so much as that it can scarce be stopt, which sometimes happens, though the Jaw be not broken, by reason of a Vein or Artery torn. This Flux of Blood is most commonly stopt by applying Lint rolled up hard, and pressing it hard down an hour or two with the Fingers. But if this does not succeed; burnt Vitriol must be ap\u00a6plyed, and a Rag dipt in Vinegar over it, which also must be pressed down with the Finger, till it be crusted. The last Remedy is an actual Cautery, which presently stops the Blood. But if any timerous Person cannot bare the drawing of a Tooth, but desires to have it extracted by Remedies. Those things are to be tryed, which are proposed every where by Authors for the same purpose, as a Paste made of Frankincense powdered, a little Starch, and the Milk of Spurge, the Root of Crow-foot, the Bark of the Root of Mulberry Tree, the Ashes of Earth-Worms, Pellitory of Spain steep'd in Vinegar, the Root of wild Cucumber infused in Vinegar, and the like. But Bears-foot is the most effectual, the Tooth being rub'd with the Leaf of it bruised, but great care must be taken, that the other Teeth be not touched with it; for if so, they wou'd be in danger to drop out. A certain Country Fellow being grievously afflicted with the Toothach, desired another to rub his Teeth with Bears-foot, who unwarily rub'd almost all his Teeth with it, and in a few hours almost all of them dropt out. Wherefore if any one intends to use so violent a Medicine, I wou'd advise him to cover the rest of his Teeth with Wax to secure them. [Page 117](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/130:5.6?vid=65404)Though the Tumour arising in the Jaws most commonly takes off the Pain of the Teeth, the Matter being translated to the outward parts; yet to procure Ease the sooner some Remedies must be used: The following Liniment does good. Take of Fresh-Butter and Hens-grease each one ounce, of the Powder of Florentine Orris one dram, of Saffron half a Scruple, of Oyl of Camomil, and Oyl of Sweet-Almonds, each half an Ounce; make a Liniment to be applied to the Jaws. A Cataplasm made of Figs bread and Vinegar operate sooner. Nettles bruised and applied to the Jaws soon ease the Pain. This Cure is for the present Pain, but if it be wont to return frequently, the generation of Humours flowing to the part must be hindred, and the Teeth must be strengthned, that they may not so easily receive the Humours flowing to them. CHAP. XLVIII. Of Black and Rotten Teeth. THE Teeth are often Black, Yellow or Livid, by reason of vitious Humours sticking to their Superficies, which by lying long on them corrode, and make them rotten; ill Vapors do the same, which arise from unwholsome Meats eaten, or from an Intemperies of the Stomach; Quick-silver used to the whole Body, or to the Face to Beautifie it, blackens the Teeth: Upon which account Women that use Paint are wont to have black or foul Teeth. In order to the Cure, the antecedent Cause must be first removed, and if ill Humours abounding in the Stomach occasion this Disease, they must be evacuated, and the Intemperies producing it must be corrected, and a [Page 118](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/131:5.6?vid=65404) good Course of Diet must be ordered, and such Meats must be avoided as are apt to corrupt the Teeth, especially those that are Sweet. There are a great many Medicines proposed to whiten the Teeth by Authors, which every one may make trial of; we use only one, which presently frees the Teeth from all Filthiness, and renders them white; and also preserves them from a Caries, that is, the Spirit of Vitriol or of Sulphur, in which a small Stick wrapt round with a Rag may be dipt, and the Teeth rubbed with it, and presently after the Teeth must be dried with a clean Linnen Cloth. When the Teeth are very foul, the pure Oyl may be used, or mixed with Honey of Roses, or it may be corrected with Simple Water, least the use of it corrode the Gums. Montanus relates that he learned this from a Woman at Rome, whom he had seen when he was very young, and she about the Age of Twenty; he found her afterwards when she was Fifty in the same Condition, who had preserved her Beauty and Strength by the use of the Oyl of Vitriol; and that her Teeth which were very ill in her Youth were become firm and clean in her old Age by the use of it; for she was wont daily to rub her Teeth and Gums gently with a drop or two of it. The Ashes of Tobacco are also excellent to cleanse and whiten the Teeth. But to preserve them and to keep them clean, they must be daily cleansed from Filth, and Meat that sticks in them, by a Tooth-picker, made of the Lignum Leutiscinum. Afterwards you must wash the Mouth with Wine, and the Teeth must be rubbed with the following Powder. Take of the Roots of Bistort, Allum, and White Coral, each one ounce; make a fine Powder wherewith rub the Teeth. [Page 119](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/132:5.6?vid=65404) CHAP. XLIX. and are eaten and ulcerated by Acrid and Corroding Humours flowing to them from the Brain, Stomach, Spleen, and other Parts. Splenetick People are more especially troubled with Ulcers of the Gums, and such as are Scorbutick; and sometimes also the Gums are corroded by Worms, or by the Humours that occasion them; so that when they continue long to be so, they signifie Worms to be in the Body. Fabritius Hildanus mentions an Observation of a Boy, that was much troubled a long while with corroded Gums, and after he had tried many Medicines both inward and outward, at length he died, and his Body being opened, there were found great numbers of Worms, which had eaten through his Guts, and lay in the Cavity of the Belly. The Cure must be first directed to the Antecedent Cause, and the Peccant Humours must be evacuated by Bleeding and Purging. The Acrid and Hot must be attemperated by Apozems, Juleps, and medicated Broths, and the like. And the Fluxions of the same Humours is to be turned, by applying Cupping-glasses to proper places. And lastly, The Diseases of the Part principally affected must be cured. And afterwards we must use Topicks, which are to be varied according to the greatness of the Disease, for in a simple Errosion those things are only to be applied which are Astringent and dry: And first the following Lotion must be used. Take of unripe Galls, of the Cups of Acorns, and of Balaustins, each one dram; of red Roses one Pugil; of Crude-allum three drams; boil them in two parts of Smiths water, and one of rough Wine: The Teeth must be often washed with this Water, and if the Errosion is not cured with it, the following Opiat must be used. [Page 120](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/133:5.6?vid=65404)Take of Dragons Blood three drams, of Wood of Aloes, red Roses, Spodium, Harts-horn burnt till it is white, and Cypress Nuts, each one dram; of Myrrh, and the Ashes of Tobacco, each one dram; of Allum two drams; make of all a Powder, mix it with Honey, and add to it a few drops of Spirit of Vitriol or Sulphur, make an Opiat, which you must spread upon a rag, and apply to the Gums at Bed-time. Spirit of Sulphur either by it self or mixed with Honey of Roses, cleanses and whitens the Teeth, and cures the Corruption of the Gums. If the Ulcer is deep or sordid, you must use the following Balsam. Take of choice Myrrh, and of Sugar-candy, each equal parts; powder them, and fill the white of an Egg with them first boiled hard and cut in the middle, afterwards bind it up with Thread, and hang it in a Cellar, put a Glass under for the Liquor to drop into, wherewith anoint the part affected often in a day. But if the foresaid Remedies will not do the business, and if the Tooth near the Ulcer be rotten, it must be drawn out, and the Ulcer will be soon cured, otherwise it will be incurable. CHAP. L. Of Blood flowing from the Gums. BLOOD sometimes flows in a great quantity from the Gums, either Critically or Symptomatically: But though a Critical Hemorrhage seldom happens by the Gums, yet that it does so sometimes, Experience and the Observations from Authors show. It flows Symptomatically from the Gums, by reason of its Acrimony, and of the vitious Constitution of the Spleen, and also the Scurvy: It also sometimes flows plentifully [Page 121](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/134:5.6?vid=65404) after the drawing of a Tooth; the little Artery being torn, which was inserted into the Root of the Tooth; upon which account sometimes so much Blood flows as kills the Patient. The Cure of a Symptomatick Flux is performed by Bleeding, and Purging, and other Remedies that correct the Disorders of the Bowels; afterwards Topicks must be used that are of an Astringent Nature, in the form of a Gargarism, Lotion, Powder, Liniment, or Opiate. If a great quantity of Blood flows upon drawing a Tooth, Revulsion first must be made by Bleeding, and Cupping-glasses and Astringent Medicines must be applied to the part; as a Cataplasm made of Bole-armenick, Dragons Blood, sealed Earth, and other Astringents mixed with the white of an Egg. If these things do not do, the Patient must apply his Finger to the part from whence the Blood flows, and must be kept there so long, till the Blood coagulated upon the Orifice of the Artery stops the Flux. If the Blood cannot be stopt by these gentle means, stronger must be used. Chalcitis burnt and applied, stops Blood wonderfully, Gum-arabick powder'd, and the Cavity fill'd with it, is also of use: So is also the Powder called Thuraloes, applied with the white of an Egg and Hares Down. CHAP. LI. Of lcers of the Mouth and Jaws. SMALL and Superficial Ulcers of the Mouth are called Aphthae, and when they are large they go under the common name of Ulcers, as those are that happen to Pocky People. These Ulcers are wont to be generated by Acrid Humours, or Vapors translated from various parts of the Body to the Jaws. So in Malignant Feavers, such Ulcers frequently happen, and to those which are of a hot Constitution, and are subject to an Intemperies of the Parts, [Page 122](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/135:5.6?vid=65404) and to others that abound with corrupted Humours, upon which Account Children are frequently troubled with Aphthae. These Ulcers are various, not only for that some are small, some greater, and because some trouble Children, and some grown People, but also because an Inflammation accompanies some of them, and others it do's not. These various Degrees happen according to the variety of Humours from whence they are generated, for either they proceed from Blood, Choler, Flegm, or Melancholy, or rather from black Choler, which is of a burning and malignant Quality. But these Differences may be known by their proper Signs, for red Ulcers proceed from Blood, yellow from Choler, white from Flegm, livid from black Choler, a stinking Ulcer signifies Putrefaction. As to the Prognostick, Aphthae properly so called are easily cured, but deep Ulcers, or such as are putrid are difficultly cured, and they are most dangerous in Children, both because they spread more by reason of the Softness of their Flesh, and also, because they cannot bear strong Medicines; upon which account Children sometimes die of them, if they are accompanied with Putrefaction and Malignity. And with respect to the Cause from whence they proceed, they are more or less Dangerous; if they proceed from Flegm there is little Danger, if from Blood, or Choler, there is more, if from black Choler most of all. Black and crusty Ulcers are deadly, especially in Children. Ulcers of the Jaws accompanied with a Feaver are dangerous. As to the Cure, a cooling and drying Diet must be ordered to hinder the Generation of the Antecedent Cause; wherefore if in Children, the Disease arises from a Fault in the Milk, either the Nurse must be changed, or her Milk must be corrected by proper Meats and Drinks, and by Bleeding and purging if there be Occasion. But you must be sure to prescribe a cooling and astringent Diet to the Nurse, as Quinces, Pears, Medlars, Lettice, and Purslain. The same must be prescribed for grown People, and they must avoid acrid, salt, and peppered Meats. [Page 123](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/136:5.6?vid=65404)Moreover with respect to the antecedent Cause, universal Evacuations must be prescribed, according to the Age of the Sick, and first, Bleeding makes a powerful Revulsion of Humours flowing to the Part, and attemperates their Acrimony, and cools the whole Body. Afterwards Cupping-glasses with Scarification must be applied, Leeches behind the Ears, and under the Chin, and a Blister must be applied to the Neck. The next Day after Bleeding Purging must be ordered suitable to the peccant Humour, and the Age, At the same time, viz. From the very beginning of the Cure, Topicks must be applied; but such as are gentle must be first used, as Gargarisms, or Lotions made with the Waters of Plantain, or Honey-suckle, and sweetned with Syrup of dried Roses, or of Mulberries, or of a Decoction, of Plantain Leaves, Bramble-tops, knot-grass, Balaustins, red Sanders, and the like, with the foresaid Syrups. And if there be an Inflammation, it is proper to add the Juice of Night-shade, House-leek or of Purslain, and Sal Prunella, in such Quantity as may not sharpen it too much, or instead of them a small Quantity of Crude Allum may be mixed with it. If there be no Inflammation, Spirit of Vitriol, or Sulphur is the only Remedy which may be used by it self to grown People; The Ulcer being touched with a Stick wrapped round the top, with a Rag dipt in it, and so simple Aphthae will be cured immediately. But for Children the Spirit must be mixed with Honey of Roses to mitigate the Sharpness, and must be used with a Stick, as above directed. If the Ulcers are very painful, and accompanied with Inflammation; the Mouth must be often gargled with Milk, or with an Emulsion of the cold Seeds, or with a Mucilage of the Seeds of Fleabean, and of Quinces extracted with Plantain and Rose-water. Lastly, If the pain be so very obstinate that it cannot be appeased by the Revulsions and Topicks proposed; but by Reason of the Violence of it, sharp Humours are continually attracted, and long Watchings occasioned, and a Wasting of the whole Body, whereby the Life is much endangered, the last Remedy are Narcoticks, which ease the Pain, and hinders the Influx of the Humours, [Page 124](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/137:5.6?vid=65404) they are to be dosed according to the Age and Strength of the Patient. I cured a Boy, says Riverius, of four Years of Age, when he was just dying, by giving him a grain of Laudanum. His Jaws and Tongue were full of deep Ulcers, and the Inflammation so great, that he cou'd not bear Topick Remedies, and the Flux of Humours so much, that they flowed perpetually out of his Mouth like a Stream, and the Child cryed Night and Day. If the Ulcer be putrid, and sordid, it must be first washed with a Decoction made of Barley and Honey of Roses, and in Children, with Milk wherein Steel has been quenched, mixed with conserve of Roses; afterwards you must use things that are stronger, Honey of Roses is the chief, made acid with the Spirit of Vitriol. If these are not sufficient, burnt Allum may be added to the things abovementioned, or Unguentum Aegyptiacum, in a greater or lesser quantity, according to the Degree of the Diseases. Lastly, If the Ulcer of the Jaws proceed from the French Pox, it cannot be cured until that is taken off. CHAP. LII. Of the Relaxation of the Uvula. THe Relaxation of the Uvula, happens by reason of a Flegmatick Humour, falling from the Head upon it, wherewith some Blood is often mixed, and then an Inflammation accompanies the Relaxation, which also frequently happens to the Almonds, concerning the Cure of which Inflammations we shall say nothing; because the Cure of them is performed by the same Remedies which were proposed for the Cure of an Inflammation of the Tongue, and for Ulcers of the Mouth with Inflammation. The Flegmatick Humour falling upon the Uvula, moistens, softens, and so relaxes it, that it touches the upper part of the Oesophagus, and creates Nauseousness, [Page 125](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/138:5.6?vid=65404) and those that are so affected, always endeavour in vain to swallow something that lies at the top of the Oesophagus, and by this Sign without Inspection, the Relaxation of the Uvula may be known. The Cure of it must be first directed to the anticedent cause, wherefore the Humours flowing from the Head, must be evacuated, and diverted by those Remedies which are proposed for the Cure of a Catarrh. The Topicks which are used in the Beginning must be astringent and repellent, such as were proposed for Ulcers in the Jaws and Gums; afterwards the things that are drying and astringent must be mixed with them; and though the Gargarisms proposed in the said Places, are profitable in these Cases; yet when there is no Inflammation, the use of Powders is more effectual. For by them the relaxed Uvula is more powerfully dried and contracted. And therefore the Bark of Pomegranates finely powdered should be first used, and in progress a little Pepper may be used with it. Or, Take of red Roses, Balaustines, Pomegranate-peel, each half a dram, of the Roots of Bistort, Tormentil, and unripe Galls, and of Florentine-orris, each one dram, of burnt Allum two Scruples, make a Powder. Common Chyrurgeons apply long Pepper powdered to it, but it is not safe, for there is Danger least the Humours should be drawn violently to the Part affected, and so should occasion some great Mischief. The manner of using these Powders is as follows: The Tongue must be depressed with a Speculum-oris, and then with a Spatula, or with a small Spoon for the Purpose; the Powder must be conveyed to the Uvula, often in a Day, till the Humour imbibed be wholly consumed. But if the Uvula relaxed cannot be reduced by the foresaid Remedies to it's former State, but still continues troublesome by being so long, the top of it must be cut off; but care must be taken that too much of it be not cut off, for if so the Speech and Respiration wou'd be injured. [Page 126](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/139:5.6?vid=65404) CHAP. LIII. Of a Quinsie. IT comes at any Time of the Year, especially between Spring and Summer, and chiefly seizes young Men, and such as are of a Sanguine Constitution, and red hair'd People, (which I have often observed) more than any other, they shiver and shake presently, a Feaver follows, and a little after a Pain and Inflammation of the Jaws, and if the Patient be not presently relieved, he can neither swallow nor draw his Breath through his Nostrils; so that he is under the apprehension of strangling, by reason the Jaws are stopt by the Inflammation and Tumour of the Uvula, Almonds, and Larynx, and is indeed in a manner suffocated. There is great Danger in this Disease, for it sometimes destroys a Man in a few Hours. In order to the Cure, I presently take away Blood plentifully from the Arm, and presently afterwards from the Veins under the Tongue, and then I order that the inflamed Parts shou'd be touched with Honey of Roses, made very sharp with Spirit of Sulphur, and that the following Gargarism shou'd be used not after the common Way, but that it shou'd be kept in the Mouth without any Agitation till it wax hot, and then that it shou'd be spit out, and that it should be repeated now and then. Take of Plantane-water, and red Rose-water, and of the Water of the Spawn of Frogs, each four ounces; the Whites of three Eggs turned to a Water by beating, of White Sugar-candy three Drams, make a Gargarism. I likewise order, that the Patient take dayly of the Emulsion prescribed in the Cure of a Pleurisie or the like. The next Morning I bleed again, unless the Feaver, and difficulty of Swallowing somewhat abate, and defer Purging till the next Day: But if both these are lessened, I presently give a lenitive Purge. If the Feaver and other Symptoms are like to be troublesome, after purging they are to be quelled by Bleeding repeated as before, by applying [Page 127](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/140:5.6?vid=65404) a large and strong Blister to the Neck, a cooling and emollient Glister is to be injected every Morning, except when the Patient purges, through the whole course of the Disease. The use of Flesh of all kinds, and their Broths are to be forbid, and the Patient is to be dieted with Oatmeal and Barley Broths, and roasted Apples, and the like, let him use a Ptisan of Barley or small Beer. Let him keep up some Hours every Day, for the warmth of the Bed heightens the Feaver, and other Symptoms. But it is to be noted, that such a Quinsie which is only a Symptom of a Feaver I call stationary, is to be cured by that Method which is requisite for the Feaver, and so is either to be taken off by Sweat and Transpiration, or by any other Method of Cure which is necessary for the primary Feaver whereon it depends, which is worth Observation. CHAP. LIV. Of an Asthma. THough an Asthma is taken for a Difficulty of Breathing in general, yet it principally Signifies that which proceeds from a stoppage of the Lungs, and an Obstruction of the Bronchia, which of its own Nature is without a Feaver, though sometimes a Feaver accompanies it. An Asthma is divided into three Species, one is called Dyspnoea, another Asthma, the third Orthopnoea. A Dyspnoea is a difficulty of Breathing, arising from an Obstruction of the Lungs; this is less than an Asthma, or Orthopnoea, and arises from a smaller Quantity of Matter that obstructs more the Substance of the Lungs, than the Bronchia; upon which account there is no Wheezing, which is occasioned by a Commotion of the Humour contained in the Bronchia. An Asthma is a great and frequent Respiration, wherein the Diaphagma, the intercostal Muscles, and the Muscles of the Abdomen are violently moved, and a Wheezing accompanies it. [Page 128](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/141:5.6?vid=65404)But an Orthopnoea, is the greatest Difficulty of Breathing, wherein the Sick can only breath, as the Word signifies, sitting upright. The Cure of an Asthma is twofold, one in the Fit, and the other out of it; in the Fit a Glister being first given, Bleeding must be used; if Blood seem to abound in any Degree, and the Sick must be placed upright in a free Air, and Smoak, or the Breath of the Standers by must not offend him; and his Cloathes, or any thing else that covers his Breast must be loosned. After Bleeding, or it being omitted, if it be not thought proper, a Phlegmagogue Purge must be given. As to Vomits, though some dislike them, yet are they very proper in this Disease, as is evident by Experience, and frequently the Fit is taken off by this Remedy alone. Sharp Glisters are often to be injected to make a Revulsion, nevertheless their Quantity ought to be small Frictions in the inferior Parts are also to be used, and many Cupping-glasses are to be applied to them, and to the Neck; afterwards the gross Humours must be moistned and attenuated, and the Wind arising from them must be discussed, to which Purpose the following Medicines must be given. Take of Gum Ammoniack and Bdellium dissolved in Vinegar of Squills, each one dram and an half of Castor, and of the Flowers of Sulphur, each half a dram, of Millepedes prepared one dram, of Salt of Ambar one scruple, of Elixir Proprietatis half a dram, with a sufficient quantity of Oxymel, make small Pills; Let him take four Morning and Evening, drinking upon them three Spoonfuls of the following Julep. Take of the Waters of Rue, Black-Cherries, Lime-flowers, each two ounces, of compound Peony, and compound Briony-waters, and of Spirit of Castor, each one ounce, of Syrup of Staethas, and Gilly-flowers, each one ounce and an half, mingle them and make a Julep. Take of the Nerve Plaister half an ounce, of Oyl of Amber four Drops, of Balsam of Sulphur half a dram, mingle them, spread a Plaister upon Leather, and apply it to the Breast. [Page 129](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/142:5.6?vid=65404)Take of the Cephalick, Plaister with Euphorbium a sufficient Quantity, make Plaisters for the Soles of the Feet. In the mean while, things that expectorate the gross Matter must be used. Take of the Pectoral Decoction a quart, add to it of Spirit of Salt-armoniack half a dram, of Oxymel of Squils half an ounce, of Tincture of Castor one dram, of Ground-ivy Water three ounces, mingle them, let him take six Spoonfuls every two Hours. Or, Take of the Seeds of Annise finely powdered, and of Powder of Liquorish, each three drams; of the Flowers of Sulphur one dram and an half; mingle them, add two ounces and an half of the best Honey, dissolved in three ounces of Cinnamon-water hordeated; make an Electuary; add to it of Balsam of Sulphur fifteen drops; of Oyl of Annise-seeds ten drops; let him take one dram every third or fourth hour, drinking upon it five Spoonfuls of the following Decoction. Take of the Roots of Elecampane one dram and an half, of the Leaves of Ground-ivy half an handful; boil them in three pints of the Pectoral Decoction strained; add three ounces of Canary-wine, Syrup of Maiden-hair two ounces and an half; mix them. The Breast must be anointed with Oyntments and Liniments that soften and discuss. Take of the Oyntment of the Flowers of Oranges, and Pomatum, each three drams; of Oyl of Nutmegs by expression two drams; of Oyl of the Berries of Juniper and Annise, each half a dram; mingle them, make a Liniment, wherewith anoint the whole Breast Morning and Evening. Take of the Oyntment of Marsh-mallows one ounce and an half, of Oyl of Annise-seeds thirty drops; make an Oyntment. If the Fit Continue, apply a Blister to the Neck; when the Fit is off, the Fluxion of the Humour must be hindred, and that which has already flowed upon the Lungs must be incided, cleansed away, and expectorated, and [Page 130](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/143:5.6?vid=65404) to restrain the Force of the Fluxion, a clear and pure Air must be chosen, and Southerly and rainy Air must be avoided, and the Air in the Night; Sleeping and Watching must be moderate, and the Humour must be purged off by the following Medicines. Take of the bitter Decoction, made with a triple quantity of Senna, three ounces and an half, Manna half a ounce, mingle them, make a Purging Potion. Or, Take of the Pilulae Ruffi one Dram, of the Species Hiera half a dram, of Salt of Wormwood half a scruple, of Aloes Rosat, and of Rhubarb powdered, each one scruple, of Elixir Proprietatis a sufficient quantity; make Ten Pills of a dram, let him take four at bed-time. Of the Days he does not Purge, let him take of the following Medicine. Take of the Seeds of Annise finely powdered two drams, with a sufficient quantity of Lucarellus's Balsam, make Pills, of each drams Six, let him take three in the Morning, and as many at four in the Afternoon, drinking upon them four ounces of the bitter Decoction. It is to be noted, that Purging must be often used in this Disease, and the Form of them must be varied, least Nature should be too much accustomed to one and the same Remedy. CHAP. LV. Of a Pleurisie. THis Disease that is as frequent as any other, comes at any time, but especially about the Spring and Summer; for at that Time the Blood being heated by the nearness of the Sun, rushes violently into effervescences and inordinate Motions. It chiefly seises those that are of a sanguine Temperament, and often country People, and those that are accustomed [Page 131](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/144:5.6?vid=65404) to much Labour. It most commonly begins with a Shaking and Shivering, and then Heat, Drouth, and Restlessness, and other Symptoms of a Feaver follow, after a few Hours, though (sometimes it is much longer before this Symptom comes) the Patient is taken with a violent pricking Pain in one of his Sides about the Ribs, which sometimes reaches towards the Shoulder-blades, sometimes towards the Back-bone, and sometimes towards the Breast, he coughs frequently, which occasions great Pain, so that sometimes he holds his Breath to prevent coughing; the Matter which is spit up at the beginning is little and thin, and often sprinkled with Particles of Blood, but in the Process of the Disease 'tis more and more concocted and mixt with Blood; the Feaver in the mean while keeps the same Pace, and is helpt on by those Symptoms that proceed from it, and the said Feaver with all its ill Train (viz. The Cough, the Spitting of Blood, the Pain, and the like) is gradually lessened, according to the Degree of the free Expectoration of the Morbisick Matter. But the Matter occasioning this Disease, does not always in the Process of it attain the Concoction that is due to Expectoration; for it often happens, that the Matter spit up is yet little and thin, as at the beginning of the Disease; and consequently the Feaver and other Symptoms do not at all remit till they have destroyed the Sick. In the mean while he is sometimes bound in his Body, and sometimes too loose, the Stools being frequent and very liquid; it sometimes happens when the Disease is very high, and Bleeding has not been used, the Patient is not able to Cough, but labouring under a great difficulty of breathing, is in a manner suffocated by the Violence of the Inflammation; which is sometimes so very great that he can't open his Breast large enough for Respiration, without exquisite Pain. And sometimes after a violent Inflammation, and when Bleeding has been ommitted which ought to have been used at the Beginning of the Disease, an Imposthume is presently occasioned, and the Cavity of the Breast is filled with Matter; in which case tho the Original Feaver either wholly ceases, or is at least lessened, yet the Patient is not out of Danger, for an Empyema or an Hectick Feaver following, the Poor Wretch dies Consumptive. [Page 132](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/145:5.6?vid=65404)But now though a Pleurisie commonly takes its rise from the proper and specifick Inflammation of the Blood, which is wont to produce it when it is an Original Disease. Yet it comes sometimes accidentally upon other Feavers, of what kind soever they be, from a Precipitation of the Febrile Matter upon the Pleura, or intercostal Muscles, and it happens for the most Part at the very beginning of the Feaver; the Febrile Matter being as yet crude, and not subdued by a fit Ebullition, and so not prepared for a due Separation; but this Inconvenience most commonly arises from an unseasonable and preposterous use of hot Medicines. For Nature being disturbed by this means, is forced to expel the Humour, as yet crude by any Way; and so sometimes the Feaverish Matter is impetuously cast upon the Meninges of the Brain, and then a Frenzy is occasioned; and sometimes upon the Membrane covering the Ribs, and from thence a Pleurisie arises; especially when the Age and Temperament of the Patient, and the Season of the Year, betwixt Spring and Summer contribute to it. For certainly at that Season Feavers are prone to turn to Pleurisies. Though this Disease has an ill Name, and is of it self more dangerous than any other, yet if it be well managed it is easily cured, and indeed as certainly as other Diseases. As to the Cure, as soon as I am called, I order that ten ounces of Blood be taken away from the Arm of the Side affected; and afterwards, I prescribe the following Potion to be taken presently after Bleeding. Take of Erratick Poppy-water four Ounces, of Sal Prunella one dram, of Syrup of Violets one ounce, mingle them, make a Draught. At the same time I prescribe the following Emulsion. Take of sweet Almonds number seven, of the Seeds of Melons, and Pompions, each half an ounce, of the Seeds of white Poppies two drams, beat them together in a marble Mortar, pouring gently upon them a Pint and an half of Barley-water, of Rose-water two drams, of Sugar-candy half an ounce, mingle them, make an Emulsion, give four ounces every fourth Hour. [Page 133](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/146:5.6?vid=65404)I also order Pectorals to be taken frequently: For instance, Take, of the Pectoral Decoction a quart, of Syrup of Violets and Maiden-hair, each one ounce and an half; mingle them, make an Apozem; let him take half a pint thrice a day. Take of the Oyl of Sweet-Almonds two Ounces, of Syrup of Violets, and Maiden-hair, each one ounce; of Sugar-candy half a dram; mingle them, make a Linctus, of which let the Patient lick often in a day. Oyl of Almonds by it self, or Oyl of Flax-seeds, is often used with good Success. As to Diet, I forbid the use of all Flesh, and all Broths of it, though never so thin: I advise that the Patient be fed with Oaten and Barly-Broths and Panada, and let him drink of a Ptysan made of Barly-water, with the Roots of Sorrel and Liquorish, and the like, and sometimes Small-beer. Moreover, I prescribe the following Oyntment. Take of the Oyl of Sweet-Almonds two ounces, of the Oyntment of Marsh-mallows and Pomatum each one ounce; mingle them, make a Liniment, with which anoint the affected side Morning and Evening, applying upon it a Cabbage-leaf. I also order he should persist in the use of the said Remedies through the whole Course of the Disease. Of the same day I am first called; if the Pain be very violent, I take away again the same quantity of Blood, or else the day following, and so the third day; and after this manner four times one day after another (unless the Patient be well before) when the Pain and other Symptoms rage violently; but if the Disease, being more moderate and less dangerous, permits me to proceed more gently; or if the Patient, being weak, cannot well bear Bleeding so often, I do not repeat it again after it has been twice used, till a day or two be past betwixt each Bleeding. I have seldom observed, that a confirmed Pleurisie has been cured in grown People with less than the loss of forty [Page 134](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/147:5.6?vid=65404) Ounces of Blood, or thereabout; though in Children, once or twice Bleeding is most commonly sufficient; nor does the Diarhea, which sometimes comes upon this Disease, hinder the foresaid repeated Bleeding; for indeed it may be soon stopt by this very Method, without any Astringent Medicine: But I either wholly omit Glisters, or take care that they be injected at as great a distance as may be betwixt the Bleedings; and they should be only made of Milk and Sugar. All the time of the Disease, I take care that the Patient be not over-heated, and therefore I give leave that he be taken every day out of his Bed, and that he keep up some hours according to his Strength; which is of so great moment in this kind of Disease, that if the Patient be kept continually in Bed, neither this so large Evacuation of Blood, nor other Remedies, how cooling soever, will sometimes do any good for the taking off the said Symptoms. Presently after the last Bleeding, unless perchance it happens before that all the Symptoms abate, and that the Patient (who has been kept hitherto for some days from all Spirituous Liquors and Strong Nourishment) soon recovers his Strength, it will be convenient to give a gentle Purge. But now if any one should say, That proceeding in this way, we scarce touch upon Expectoration, so far are we from discoursing largely of the ways by which it is to be promoted, through the various Seasons of the Disease, he is to know that these things were not unwarily past over: But after good consideration designedly neglected; for I always thought that they were in very great danger, who committed the Cure of this Disease to Expectoration; for it often happens that part of the Morbifick Matter being concocted, and perhaps spit up, the rest remains crude; the best maturating and expectorating Medicines having been used in vain; for sometimes the Expectoration goes on very well, and sometimes is wholly suppressed. The Patient in the mean while being in Jeopardy on every hand, and for any power I have over Expectoration, which indeed is none at all, may be adjudged for Life or Death; whereas on the contrary by Bleeding, the Morbifick Matter is in my power, and the Orifice of the [Page 135](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/148:5.6?vid=65404) Vein may supply the use of the Aspera arteria; for I confidently assert, that this Disease, which if it be treated by the Method we have spoken against, is deservedly reckon'd among the most dangerous, may be as certainly and as safely cured, by the Method I have now prescribed, as any other Disease whatever; nor could I ever find the least Injury befall any one by so large an Evacuation of Blood, though unskilful People think otherwise; but for as much as the Cure of this Disease almost wholly consists in Bleeding repeated, which being performed in places far distant from populous Towns by unskilful Surgeons and Farriers, Poor People are often in danger of losing their Arms, and their Lives are hazarded by the Pricking of a Tendon. I thought sit to add here the Cure of such Punctures when they happen: They whose Tendons are prick'd do not presently perceive a Pain, but twelve Hours after Bleeding they complain of it, not so much in the Orifice lately made, as in the Parts tending to the Arm-pits, where at length the Pain fixes, and is chiefly perceived when the Arm is extended: But the part hurt has no great Swelling, that scarce exceeding the bigness of a Hazel-nut; an Ichor continually distills from the Orifice, which is the chief sign of a Puncture of a Tendon, I have known it cured in the following manner. Take of the Roots of white Lillies four ounces; boil them till they are soft in a quart of Cows Milk; then take of Oat-meal, and of the Meal of Flax-seeds, each three ounces, boil the Meal to the consistence of a Pultis, in a sufficient quantity of the Milk strained from the aforesaid Roots, and mingle the Roots mash'd; make a Cataplasm, apply it hot Morning and Evening to the part affected. [Page 136](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/149:5.6?vid=65404) CHAP. LVI. Of a Peripneumonia. A Peripneumonia is an Inflammation of the Lungs, with an acute Feaver, a Cough, and a difficulty of Breathing: They that have this Disease perceive a great Inflammation in the Breast, with a Swelling of the Lungs, and sometimes a pricking Pain; they labour for Breath, and Breath is short; the Feaver is accompanied with great Thirst, Watchings, and a troublesom Cough, and the Spitle Bloody, or streaked with Blood. The formal reason, and the conjunct cause of a Peripneumonia, consist in the Febrile Effervescence of the Blood, together with the Stopage of it in the narrow passages of the Lungs, which occasions an Inflammation there. It is observed that a Peripneumonia frequently follows, or comes upon a Pleurisie, or succeeds a Quinsie. As to the Prognosticks of this Disease, common Experience does attest, that 'tis a very dangerous Disease; for many either dye of it, or very difficultly recover Health; and this is manifest from its Aetiology; for a Wound with a great Extravasation or Stagnation of Blood made in the Lungs, is very difficultly cured, and the affected place is never restored to its Pristine State. The Prognostick Signs which are of chiefest note, are taken from appearance of the Symptoms, and from the nature of things evacuated, and from the degrees of Strength. A Peripneumonia coming upon a Pleurisie or Quinsie, most commonly is worse than when it comes of it self, or succeeds either of them. But if upon this Disease, after what manner soever begun, an acute Feaver presently follows, with great Thirst, Watchings, and an Orthopnoea; it is ill, and yet much worse, if a Delirium, or Phrensie, or Convulsive Motions, or an Hemiplegia come upon it. [Page 137](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/150:5.6?vid=65404)Moreover, The Patient is as much indangered if he be very Short-breathed, if he be troubled with Vomiting, or frequent Swooning away, a weak Pulse, or cold Sweats: For while these Symptoms are urgent, the Obstruction of the Blood in the Lungs is not at all removed, nothing is digested or spit up; but the Circulation of the Blood being more and more obstructed, and its Accension by Respiration hindred, the Animal Spirits are much disordered; so that at length the Strength is quite spent, and the Vital Flame extinguished. As to the Prognosticks from things evacuated, we observe a Peripneumonia to be dangerous when nothing is spit up; Next to this, when the Spittle is thin and crude, mixed with Blood; it's far better when the Spittle is yellow and thick, streaked with a little Blood. The Urine being yellow from the beginning, and of a good Consistence, with a cloud in the midst, shews that almost all the Impurities are lodged in the place affected; when from that state it is changed into a thick and turbid Urine, it shews that the Morbifick Matter is resorbed from that part into the Blood: But if such kind of Urine be suddenly changed into a thin one, then a Delirium, or Death it self, is at hand. Much Sweat, and plenty of Urine, a Diarrhaea, Bleeding at Nose; the Flux of the Courses, or of the Hemorrhoids, are good Signs in this Disease; yea, any of these Evacuations happening seasonably, do frequently discharge the Disease. The condition of Strength is ever of great Moment in making a due Prognostick in this Disease; for oftentimes when there be dreadful Symptoms, as a violent Feaver, a difficulty of Breathing, with a Cough, Watchings, and other ill Signs, if the Pulse be as yet strong, and the Animal Spirits vigorous, there is more hope of the Patient, than when these things are more sedate, if the Pulse be weak, and the Spirits torpid and oppress'd. The first Indication of Cure in a Peripneumonia, is, That the Blood impacted in the Vessels of the Lungs, and causing Obstruction and Inflammation, may be discussed from thence, and restored to its wonted Circulation; but if it cannot be done, the second Indication will be, that the Matter be duly digested, or suppurated, and presently spit up. [Page 138](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/151:5.6?vid=65404)While the former Indication prevails, the Intentions of Healing may be these following: First, That the more plentiful Flux of Blood to the part affected be prevented: Secondly, We must endeavour that the Blood stagnating or extravasated in the Lungs, be resorbed again by the Veins into the rest of the Mass, and restored to Circulation: And that it may be the better done, the Blood ought thirdly to be freed from its Clamminess whereby its Fluidity is hindred. Fourthly, We must take care of the most urgent Symptoms, viz. The Feaver, Cough, Watchings, and difficulty of Breathing: But if notwithstanding all these things, the other Indication shall come into use; it will be requisite to prescribe maturating and expectorating Medicines vulgarly so called, together with these Remedies just mentioned. That we may answer the first and second Intention together, Bleeding is for the most part requisite in every Peripneumonia, yea, sometimes it ought to be frequently repeated; for the Vessels being emptied of Blood, do not only withdraw the Nourishment of the Disease, but do often resorbe the Matter impacted in the part affected: Wherefore if Strength remain, and the Pulse be strong enough, large Bleeding is convenient at the very beginning; but otherwise let it be used in a small quantity; which however may be repeated as occasion offers it self. It is to be noted, that Blood drawn in a Peripneumonia, and also in a Pleurisie, after it's cold, contains in its Superficies a small viscous and discoloured Film. Moreover, we may observe one while the Blood entirely bad, another while only part of it is subject to this change; for when the Blood is received in three or four Dishes, sometimes in all, but oftner in the second and third Dish, it is apparently bad, and in the first and last good enough. Wherefore it is commonly ordered, that the Blood is always to run so long, till that which is so depraved begins to come forth; and if there be sufficient Strength, the flowing out is to be continued till it runs good again: Indeed as frequent Experience does approve of this Practice, so doth Reason it self; for in this Disease, seeing the whole Mass of Blood does not presently acquire that Clamminess, the depraved Portions are chiefly accumulated about the place of the Obstruction, and adhere on every side in the [Page 139](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/152:5.6?vid=65404) lesser Vessels; wherefore the Blood first flowing out by Phlebotomy is often good: Afterwards, the Vessels being emptied, receive the other Morbifick Stagnating before, and restore it to Circulation; and when Portions of it placed near, troop together to the Orifice of the Vein, they flow out together; and after that the corrupted Blood hath flowed out, the residue more pure doth succeed. Wherefore in this case, let Incision be ever made with a large Orifice, and let the Blood be drawn out with a large and continued Stream; for otherwise, if in the midst of Bleeding, the bad Blood issuing out, the Orifice (as the Manner of some is, that the Spirits should not faint) be closed with the Finger; when it is opened again, the pure Blood will flow next, but the bad sliding by, if there be any remaining, will not presently return to that Orifice. Besides Phlebotomy, many other Remedies, namely, whatever does repress that Urgency of Blood, and empty the Passages thereof, are to be used, wherefore a very thin Diet is prescribed, for the most part meerly of Barley and Oats; and though Catharticks are altogether prohibited, because they disquiet the Blood, and hurry it impetuously upon the Part affected, yet Glisters which gently loosen the Belly, and draw the Impurities of the Blood towards the Belly, ought to be daily used. Moreover Juleps, and temperating Apozems which restrain the Feaver of the Blood, and evacuate the Superfluous Sorosities of it, and gently open the Passages of the Breast, are used with good Success. The third Intention of Healing which respects the taking off the Clamminess or Obstructing Viscosity of the Blood, is wholly to be performed by Remedies, which unloose the Frame thereof too much bound, and dissolve the Combinations of the Salts, as testaceous Powders, the Tooth of a Boar, the Jaws of a Pike, and other things indued with an Alkali Salt, also Sal-prunella. I have frequently known the Spirit of Sal-Armoniack, and Harts-horn to have yielded notable Relief in this Disease, and the Infusion of Horse-dung, by reason of its volatile Salt is of great use, though it be a common Remedy. As to the Symptoms and their Cure, very many Remedies appropriated to these, fall in together with the former, for against the Feaver the same Juleps and Apozems, [Page 140](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/153:5.6?vid=65404) which appease the Heat of the Blood, and withall recreate the Animal Spirits are to be used; to which, in respect of the Cough and Difficulty of breathing, temperate pectoral Remedies are added. The greatest Difficulty is what ought to be exhibited against want of Sleep, when it is very urgent; for Opiats because they further the Difficulty of breathing in this Disease, are scarce safely taken; yea sometimes they are very pernicious; wherefore Laudanum, and the strong Preparations of Opium, are to be shunned in a Peripneumonia, more than a Dog or a Snake. Nevertheless, Anodyns and gentle Hypnoticks, as Water and Syrup of Red Poppies are not only allowed, but are accounted Specifick Remedies in this Disease, and in a Pleurisie; and sometimes it will be expedient to use Diacodiats, if the Strength be sufficient, and the Pulse strong enough; for the Pain of the Breast, if at any time it be troublesome, it is necessary to apply Liniments, Fomentations, and Cataplasms. The second curative Indication which intends the Digestion of the Matter impacted in the Lungs, (if it cannot be dispersed or resorbed,) and to throw it up by Spittle requires ordinary, maturating, and expectorating Medicines that are temperate, such as asswage Thirst, and appease the Feaverish Heat. The more select Remedies, that are chiefly accommodated to this Disease shall be now mentioned. The Medicines conducing to the first and second Intention are prescribed according to the following Forms. Take of the Waters of Maries Thistle ten ounces, of red Poppies three ounces, of the Syrup of red Poppies one ounce, of Pearls prepared one dram, make a Julep. The Dose is six Spoonfuls every fourth Hour. Take of Black Cherry Water, of the Water of Carduus Benedictus, and of Baulm, each four ounces, of the Powder of Boars Tooth one dram, of Syrup of Violets ten drams, make a Julep to be taken after the same manner. Take of Grass-roots three ounces, Shavings of Ivory, and Harts-horn, each three drams; Raisons stoned one ounce [Page 141](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/154:5.6?vid=65404) and an half, Liquorish two drams; boil them in Spring Water, from three Pints to two; to the strained Liquor add, Syrup of Violets one ounce, Sal-prunella one dram; make an Apozem. Take three or four ounces thrice a Day, For the same Intention, viz. that the Vessels being emptied may substract the Nourishment of the Disease, or resorbe the morbifick Matter, Purging is prescribed by many. The Ancients in this Disease as in many other, used after Phlebotomy, Preparatives and Purgatives in a constant Course; and of late the Chymists with greater Boldness give Vomits, and prefer them before all other Remedies in Peripneumonia; yea neglecting or forbidding Bleeding, they chiefly depend on Stibiate Vomits, but I think there cannot be a more pernicious Course; for though sometimes they do no hurt in rustick and robust Bodies, yet they are without Success; but in tender Constitutions they are in a manner as destructive as Poison. But as to Purging, though it may not be convenient at the very Beginning, for indeed it's then most commonly injurious, yet the Fluxion of the Morbifick Matter being stopt, and the Effervescence of the Blood being appeased, we may safely evacuate the Body with a lenitive Purge. Take of the Decoction of Senna gerionis four ounces, of Syrup of Roses solutive one ounce, mingle them, make a Potion. Or, Take of the best Senna three drams, of all the Cassia, and Tamarinds, each half an ounce; of Coriander Seeds two drams, let them be boiled in a sufficient Quantity of Fountain Water to six ounces; when it is strained add one ounce of Syrup of Violets; let it be clarified with the white of an Egg, and give it. Purgatives are not always to be given, nor ever unadvisedly in this Disease, but Glisters are used frequently, and most commonly daily; they must be gentle and emollient, such as easily move the Belly, without any great Agitation of the Humours or Blood; for this purpose, [Page 142](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/155:5.6?vid=65404) Milk or Whey is often convenient, with brown Sugar, or Syrup of Violets. Or, Take of the Leaves of either Sort of Mallows, of Melilot and Mercury, each one handful; of Linseed, and sweet Fennel-seeds, each half an ounce; of sweet Prunes Number six; boil them in a sufficient Quantity of Spring water to a Pint, to which add Syrup of Violets one ounce, Sugar ten drams, Sal Prunella one dram, make a Glister. Medicines for the third Intention, viz. for dissolving the Clamminess of the Blood, are wont to be administred in the Form of a Powder, of a Spirit, or a Potion, according to the Manner following. - 1. Powders. Take of Crabs-eyes two drams, of Sal prunella one dram and an half, of pearled Sugar one dram, make a Powder for six Doses, one to be taken every Sixth Hour, with a proper Julep or Apozem. Or, Take of the Tusk of a Boar, of the Jaw of a Pike, or of Crabs-eyes, each one Dram and an half; of the Flowers of Sal Armoniack, of the Powder of red Poppy Flowers, each half a dram; mix them for four Doses, - 2. Spirits and Chymical Liquors. Take of Spirit of Sal-armoniack distil'd with Olibanum three drams, the dose is from fifteen drops to twenty, thrice a day. Or, Take of the Spirit of rine, or Soot, after the same manner. Take of the sweet Spirit of Nitre three drams, the dose it from six drops to ten. - 3. Potions. Take of Carduus-water one Pint, fresh Horse-dung three ounces, dissolve it warm, and filter it; the dose is three or four ounces twice or thrice a day; add half an ounce of Syrup of Violets, or of red Poppies. Or, [Page 143](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/156:5.6?vid=65404)Take of the Leaves of Dandelion two handfuls bruised, and infused in half a Pint of the Water of Maries Thistle, Treacle-water half an ounce, press them out, add Powder of Crabs-eyes one dram; take four or six Spoonfuls thrice a day. The fourth Intention of Healing in respect of the Symptoms greatly urging, does suggest divers Sorts of Operations. First, in respect of the Feaver, the Juleps and Apozems above prescribed are convenient. Moreover the Use of Sal-prunella ought to be frequent. Secondly, for the Cough and difficulty of Breathing, Lambatives and Decoctions, or Pectoral Juleps are administred with Success. Take of the Syrups of Jujubes, and Maiden-hair, each one ounce and an half; of Syrup of Violets one ounce, Flowers of Nitre one Scruple, make a Linctus to be lick'd now and then. Take of Syrup of Marsh-mallows one ounce, of Diacodium, and of Syrup of red-poppies, each half an ounce; Powder of Crabs-eyes two Scruples, make a Linctus to be taken the same Way. Take of the Syrups of Hyssop, and Liquorish, each one ounce and an half; of the Powder of red-poppy Flowers one Scruple, of Crabs-eyes one dram, of the Lohoch of the Pine six drams, make a Lohoch, take the Quantity of a Nutmeg four times, or oftner in a Day. Take of the Roots of Grass, Chervil, Marsh-mallows, each one ounce; Figs Number four, Jujubs, of each Number six; Raisins one ounce, Liquorish three drams, Barley half an ounce, boil them in three Pints of Spring-water to a Quart, strain them, the Dose is three or four ounces. Take of Raisins stoned one ounce and an half, Filberds number four, of Liquorish sliced three drams, of Hyssop Water one Pint and an half, infuse them warm in a close Vessel six Hours, strain them, and add one ounce and an half of Syrup of Marsh-mallows, make a Julep; the dose is three or four Spoonfuls often in a day, swallowing it by degrees. [Page 144](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/157:5.6?vid=65404)Thirdly, Against Watching. Take of Red-poppy water three ounces, of Syrup of the same six drams, of Epidemick-water two drams, make a Draught to be taken at Bed-time. If the Pulse be strong, and the Strength remains. Take of Cowslip Water three ounces, of Diacodium half an, ounce, make a Draught to be taken at Bed-time. Fourthly, If the Pain be much about the Place affected. Take of Oyntment of Marsh-mallows two ounces, of Oyl of sweet Almonds one ounce and an half, mingle them, make a Liniment to be applyed with thin Paper. Fifthly, For the last Intention of healing, (which assisting the Secundary Indication prescribes Medicines maturating, and expectorating) the following Forms are convenient. Take of Linseed Oyl fresh drawn three ounces, Syrup of Violets two ounces, of Hissop water half a Pint, mingle them in a Glass, take two or three ounces twice or thrice a day, shaking the Glass first. Take of Olibanum powdered one dram, put it into an Apple made hollow, roast the Apple in the Embers, let him eat it at Bed-time, repeating it three or four times. Take of Oyl of Almonds fresh drawn, of Syrup of Maidenhair, each one ounce and an half; Sugar-candy, two drams, stir them in a glass Mortar till they are perfectly mixed, make a Linctus to be taken often in a day with a Liquorish Stick, also let a Spoonful be taken thrice a day in a Draught of Posset drink. It would be easie to produce many Observations of Peripneumonick Patients, but seeing the Type of the Disease, and the Reasons of the Symptoms, are in all almost the same, it will be sufficient to mention only one or two; and while I was writing these Things, I was sent [Page 145](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/158:5.6?vid=65404) for to a Patient very Sick of a Peripneumonia, he was about fifty Years old, lean and cholerick, he fell into a Feaver by taking Cold, he was troubled with a Cough, a pain in the Breast, and a Difficulty of Breathing, when he had continued thus four days without any Remedy or Physical Administration, I found him in a great Feaver, with Thirst, and a great Inflammation in the Breast, breathing very difficultly and painfully, and ratling, insomuch that he seemed in the Agony of Death; but because his Pulse was strong enough, though quick and disturbed, I presently ordered him to be blooded, and that eight or ten ounces of Blood should be taken away, and seeing he was little relieved after three Hours Intermission, a Glister being first administred I ordered twelve ounces more of Blood to be taken away; moreover I prescribed Spirit of Harts horn, twelve drops of it to be given every sixth Hour with a proper Julep, and between I ordered a Dose of the following powder to be administred, Take Powder of Crabs-eyes, and Sal-prunella, each one dram and an half; of Pearl one dram, Sugar-candy two scruples; make a Powder to be divided into eight Doses. Moreover, he took as often as he pleased a Draught of a pectoral Apozem; by the use of these within three hours all the Symptoms began to abate, and the Night after he sweated and slept a little; the day after I repeated Phlebotomy, and then continuing the same Remedies, he recovered in four or five Days; the Blood we took from him was always in the Superficies viscous and discoloured. A certain Gentleman of a Sanguine Complexion, and of a strong Habit of Body, after immoderate drinking of Wine, fell into a Feaver with a grievous Peripneumonia, so that Heat and Thirst mightily afflicting him, sitting always upright in his Bed or Chair, and breathing short and very frequent, he could scarce draw in Air enough to sustain the vital Flame; because he could not undergo large Bleeding, I took it away by degrees, twice or thrice day after day; Glisters were often injected. Moreover, Apozems, and Juleps, also Spirit of Sal-armoniack, and Testacious Powders were given by turns; within four or five days the Feaver some what abated, also he began to [Page 146](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/159:5.6?vid=65404) breath better, and sometimes to sleep a little; yet he did always complain of a great Heaviness of his Breast, and of an intolerable Oppression of the Lungs; wherefore when Bleeding was no longer safe, I applied very large Blisters to the Arms and Thighs; the Blisters on his Arms soon dried up, but those on his Legs did not only remain open, but after five or six days did run very much, and afterwards almost for a Month daily discharged great Plenty of a sharp Ichor; in the mean time his Lungs sensibly amended, and at length were freed of their Burden. Lastly, The little Sores raised by the Blisters were difficultly cured, and not without frequent Applications of Medicines. CHAP. LVII. Of a Bastard Peripneumonia. A Feaver accompanied with many Peripneumonick Symptoms, invades yearly about the beginning of Winter, but oftner at the End of it; it chiefly seizes those that are of a gross Habit of Body, and middle aged, or (which oftner happens) those that are older, and too much addicted to Spirituous Liquors, especially to Brandy; for when the Blood in such Men has been burdened with Flegmatick Humours, heapt up in the Winter, and stirr'd into a new Motion by the approaching Spring, a Cough is presently occasioned by this Means, by which the said Flegmatick Humous rush upon the Lungs; at which time, if the Patient chance to live irregularly, and continues to drink freely such spirituous Liquors, the Matter growing almost thick, which occasioned the Cough, stops the Passages of the Lungs, and the Feaver consumes the Mass of Blood: At the beginning of the Feaver, the Patient is sometimes hot and sometimes cold, is giddy, ond complains of a launcing Pain of his Head; when the Cough is violent, he vomits up all liquid things when he coughs, and sometimes when he does not; the Urin is turpid and very red; the Blood taken away is like that of Pleuriticks; [Page 147](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/160:5.6?vid=65404) he is often short breath'd: If he cough, his Head akes just as if it were cleft in Pieces (for so the Patient terms it) there is a Pain of the whole Breast, or at least a Pressure of the Lungs, which is perceived by the Standers by when the Patient coughs; the Lungs not sufficiently dilating themselves, the vital Passages are as it seems shut up by the Swelling, and the Circulation on that Account is so intercepted, and the Blood so stopt, that there are no Signs of a Feaver, though this may also happen by reason of the Plenty of the Flegmatick Matter, by which the Blood is so burdened, that it cannot rise to a perfect Ebullition, especially in gross Bodies. In curing this Feaver I count I am oblidged to take away that Blood by Phlebotomy, which occasions the Suffocation and Inflammation of the Lungs, and to ventilate and open the Lungs with Pectoral Remedies, and to mitigate the Heat of the whole Body with a cooling Diet: but whereas on the one hand the Heap of Flegmatick Matter contained in the Veins daily supplying Matter for the Inflammation of the Lungs, may seem to indicate Bleeding often repeated; yet on the other hand I found by the best Observation I could make, that Bleeding often repeated, has succeded very ill in Feavorish People of a gross Habit of Body, especially if they have passed the Flower of their Age, and therefore I forbore the Repetition of it; and instead of it, used frequent Purging, which is well enough substituted for it, in those that abhor large and often repeated Bleeding. Therefore I proceeded after this manner: I ordered that the Patient should be blooded in the Arm lying in Bed, and that he should not rise till two or three Hours after; for all Blood letting somewhat weakning and disordering the whole Body, may by this means the easier be born; for the Patient lying a Bed can better bear the taking away of ten ounces, than of six or Seaven when he is up; the next day I give the following Potion in the Morning. Take of Cassia extracted one ounce, of Liquorish two drams, of fat Figs number four, of the Leaves of Senna two drams and an half, of Agarick trochiscated one dram, boil them in a sufficient Quantity of Water, in four ounces of the strained Liquor dissolve one ounce of Manna, [Page 148](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/161:5.6?vid=65404) of Syrup of Roses solutive half an ounce, mingle them, make a Potion. The next day I used to bleed a second time; and the next day save one, I order the Purging Potion above prescribed, to be repeated, and to be given every other day till the Patient is quite well; when the Patient does not purge, I advise him to use a pectoral Decoction, and Oyl of sweet Almonds, and the like. I forbid the use of Flesh, and the Broth of it, but especially of all spirituous Liquors; in the stead of which I allow him for his ordinary drink a Ptisan of Barley and Liquorish, and small Beer, if he desire it. And indeed, the Bastard Peripneumonia occasioned by a great deal of Flegmatick Filth heapt up in the Blood, is to be cured by Bleeding repeated, and by Purging. Though this Bastard Peripneumonia is something like a dry Asthma, both as to Difficulty of Breathing, and some other Symptoms; yet it is sufficiently distinguished from it; for in this there are manifest Signs of a Feaver, and Inflammation, which never appear in that, though in this kind they are much less and obscurer than those which accompany a true Peripneumonia. But you must carefully observe, that 'tis by no means safe to forbid the drinking of Spirit of Wine, and such Liquors all of a sudden, when the Patient has been a while addicted to them, but they must be left off Gradually; for there is Danger of a Dropsie from an hasty and abrupt Change, which ought to be observed in all Diseases that come on this Occasion; and seeing there has been Mention made of Spirit of Wine, I will say by the by, that indeed it ought to be wished that they were either wholly prohibited, or at least used for refreshing the Spirits, and not for extinguishing them; or that the internal use of them was wholly abdicated, and that they should be only used by Surgeons, in Fomentations to digest Ulcers, or to be applied to Burns, in which Case they are better than any other Medicine yet found out, for they defend the under Skin from Putrefaction, and so soon perform the Cure (not waiting for Digestion, which requires a considerable Time) if a Rag dipt in Spirit of Wine be presently applyed to the Part hurt, with Scalding Water, Gunpowder, or the [Page 149](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/162:5.6?vid=65404) like, and moistned with the foresaid Spirit now and then, till the Pain from the Fire be quite gone, and afterwards only twice a day. CHAP. LVIII. Of an Empyema. AN Empyema is a Collection of Matter within the Cavity of the Breast, whereby the Organs of Respiration are oppressed. This Collection of Matter is occasioned either by a Pleurisie, Peripneumonia, or Angina, suppurated and broken. The Signs of an Empyema, either shew it is coming, or that it is already perfectly formed. Of the former kind are these Diseases going before, from whence this usually arises, as a Pleurisie, Peripneumonia, and Angina; and sometimes also a Bruise or Wound in the Breast, and sometimes also other Diseases not well carried off; from whence there will be a greater Suspicion of an Empyema, if after a Week or two passed without plentiful Spitting, Shaking and a Feaver, and Faintness of the Spirits supervene; and then after fourteen or twenty Days, the Signs of a confirmed Empyema will appear, viz. Difficulty of Breathing, a Weight upon the Breast, Fluctuation of the Matter, an uneasiness from Motion, Thirst, and almost always a small Feaver, Redness of the Cheeks, Restlesness, and Watching. As to the Cure of an Empyema, you must first consider whether the Signs of its being already made be certain or dubious; in the former Case there is not much use of Medicines; but the Body being well prepared, we must presently open the Side; wherefore if from a Pleurisie, or a Peripneumonia not well cured, or if by reason of Blood extravasated by a Blow, a Fall, or Wound, a Fluctuation of Pus, of Purulent or Bloody Matter be perceived, and the Spittle lessened, or none at all, it is to no purpose to wast Time in using expectorating and maturating Medicines; but having loosned the Belly, by Juleps, Apozems, and Anodyns, an Aperrion must be undertaken, either by the Knife, or in tender and timerous People by applying a Caustick betwixt the sixth or seventh Vertebra; and when the Eschar is made, we must divide it gently with a Knife, and pass the Knife gently into the Cavity of the Breast; then having put in a Silver Pipe, the Matter must be evacuated by degrees; but it must be let out as hastily as the Strength of the Patient will permit; for that which remains within, will stink horridly in a few days; to prevent which a cleaning and Traumatick Liquor must be injected, with a Syringe twice or thrice a day. It is not necessary to describe particularly the Manner of the Operation, it being well known, and often practiced by skilful Chirurgions, and daily practiced. After it is cut open and dressed as it ought to be, there is little more to be done by the Physician. An exact Course of Diet, a frequent Loosning of the Belly (so oft as there is Occasion) by Glisters, and also these Remedies, which are Vulgarly called Traumatick, which do hinder the Dissolution of the Blood, and keeps the Seresities of it from falling upon the Breast to hurt it, ought to be prescribed. But if the Signs of this Disease are uncertain, or altogether doubtful, the Breast ought not to be opened too soon or rashly. I have known some have their Breasts opened to no purpose, when they have spit stinking Pus, and they have also laboured under a Dyspnaea, and a Difficulty of Breathing; therefore when an Empyema is not evident by Pathognomick Signs, Medicines (such as are prescribed for the Cure of a Peripneumonia) which help Expectoration, and evacuate gently by Sweat and Urine, ought to be used for some time: If these do not any Good, and the Empyema still remains, or Augments, then the Breast must be opened. As to the Forms of the Medicines requisite for the Cure of an Empyema before Section, the same Remedies which were prescribed for a Peripneumonia, are to be used: but after the opening of the Breast the following are chiefly to be used. To prevent Fainting which may happen either in the Operation or after it, the following Julep must be in Readiness, and four or five Spoonfuls of it must be taken upon occasion. [Page 151](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/164:5.6?vid=65404)Take of the Waters of Balm, and Black Cherries, each six ounces; of Aqua-mirabilis one ounce, of Pearl powdered one dram, of Syrup of Gilly-flowers one ounce, mingle them, make a Julep. The following Decoction must be taken twice or thrice in a day. Take of the Leaves of Hemp, Agrimony, Colts-foot, of Madder, and Chervil, each one ounce; of Barley half an ounce, of red Cicers half an ounce, Raisons of the Sun one ounce and an half; boil them in two Quarts of Fountain-water till half is consumed, sweeten it with Clarified Honey, or with the Syrup of Mouse-ear as it is taken. If there be no Feaver the following Pills may be used. Take of the Powders of Crabs-eyes two drams, of Flowers of Sulphur one dram, of Sal-Prunella half a dram, of the Species Diarrhodon-abbatis one Scruple, of venice Turpentine washed a sufficient quantity; make a Mass, make small Pills, take a Scruple or half a dram of them Morning and Evening; or the Turpentine being omitted, half a dram or two Scruples may be taken in the Form of a Powder twice a Day. [Page 152](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/165:5.6?vid=65404) CHAP. LIX. Of a Consumption. A Phthysis in general, is a Consumption of the Muscular Parts of the Body: It is twofold, either Original or Sympromatick. There are two Species of the original Phthysis, viz. Atrophia, and a Consumption of the Lungs. An Atrophia is twofold, viz. Either Nervous, or arising from Inanition. A Symptomatick Phthysis is occasioned by other Diseases going before. An Atrophy, or Nervous Phthysis, is a Consumption of the whole Body, without any considerable Feaver, Cough, or difficulty of Breathing, but loss of Appetite and Indigestion accompany it; upon which account Faintness, and a daily wasting of the Body follow. This sort of Consumption sometimes happens in England, but very often to the Inhabitants of Virginia, when they return hither. In the beginning of this Disease, the Body appears Oedematous, the Face Pale and Squalid, and the Stomach nauseates every thing but Liquors; and the Strength is so languid, that the Sick, before the Fleshy parts are evidently consumed, is rendred so very Weak, that he cannot keep from Bed, the colour of the Urine is most commonly of a deep Red, and very little in quantity, though sometimetimes (but rarely, as it is wont to happen in Diseases of the Nerves) it is pale, and voided in a great quantity; but no considerable Feaver can be discerned, either by the Pulse, Drouth, or Heat, how high-coloured soever the Urine is; so that the Pathognomonick Signs of this Consumption beginning, are Faintness and want of Appetite, without any notable Feaver, Cough, or short Breath; though in progress of the Disease, when the habit of the Body is wasted, some difficulty of Breathing (as is usual in all that are Faint) may be perceived. This Disease is very difficultly cured, if the Physician be not made use of at first; it ends in an Hydropical and [Page 153](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/166:5.6?vid=65404) Oedematous Tumour of the Body, especially of the lower parts, and then the Disease is past all hope. The main of the business must be performed by Stomachick Medicines, and such as strengthen the Nerves, such are Chalybeats, Antiscorbuticks, and Cephalicks, and bitter things of every kind: For Instance, Let the Sick take, if his Body be bound, four Ounces of the bitter Decoction with Senna, and every fourth night two Ounces of Tinctura Sacra, or of the Tinctura of Hiera Picra, made in the Waters of Rue, Black Cherries, Compound Peony. In his ordinary Drink, hang a Bag of Cephalicks, and Antiscorbuticks; an hour before Dinner let him take half a Dram of Elixir Proprietatis in a Draught of Whitewine, wherein Wormwood has been infused: Apply to the Region of the Stomach the Magisterial Stomachick Plaister, with a few drops of the Chymical Oyl of Cinnamon and Wormwood; or foment the Stomach daily with Aromatick Bags, made of the Leaves of Mint and Wormwood, Cinnamon, Mace, Zedoary, Galingal, Cyperus, and Sweet-smelling Flag, and boil'd in it be Summer-time, let him drink Chalybeat Waters; if Winter, Syrup of Steel or the Wine of it, made by quenching Filings of Steel in good Whitewine three or four times; then by infusing in it Zedoary, Galingal, Nutmegs, sharp Cloves grosly beaten: But amongst Chalybeats, Mynsichts extract is thought the best, which must be given in the form of a Bole, or of Pills, for the space of twenty or thirty days. For Instance, Take of the Extract of Mynsicht half a scruple, Balsam of Gilead seven drops, of Haly's Powder six grains, of the Compound Powder of Wake-Robin four grains, of the Powder of Liquorish a sufficient quantity; make Pills of an ordinary size, repeat them every day once. Opobalsamum by it self, as also Spirit of Harts-horn, and Spirit of Sal-armoniack, are very effectual in this case, because they are agreeable to the Nerves. For Instance, Let the Sick take eight or ten drops of Opobalsam, or of Spirit of Harts-horn, in a sufficient quantity of Sugar-candy. [Page 154](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/167:5.6?vid=65404) Let him endeavour to make himself Chearful by Exercise and Company; for this Disease most commonly proceeds from Care and Sorrow; and let him live in a good and open Air: And because the Stomach is chiefly affected in this Disease, he must eat a delicate sort of Meat, and not be too long accustomed to any one. The Consumption that proceeds from Innanition is next to be discoursed of; and first, Of that which proceeds from an Hemorrhage, whither by the Nostrils, or from the Lungs by Coughing, or from the Jaws by Hawking, or from the Stomach by Vomit, or from the Reins by Urine, or from the Hemorrhoidal or Uterin Vessels in the customary monthly Purgation, or from hard Labour; or lastly, from Wounds when there has been a great and long Flux of Blood. In this case the Hemorrhage must be first stopt by thickning Remedies, and by binding hard the extream parts; and if there be occasion, and the Sick have Strength, Bleeding must be used frequently, but sparingly; you must apply, if the part will admit of it, Galen's Stiptick Plaister, the Royal Stiptick Water, Oxycrat cold, Ink, Ashes of Hair a little burnt in a Retort, and with Vinegar made up in the form of a Cataplasm, true Bole, Dragons blood, and the like; and they must be often renewed. Let the Sick take inwardly three or four times a day twenty or thirty drops, or more, of the Royal Stiptick-water, in a Draught of the Milk-water, and five or six Spoonfuls of the clarified Juices of Plantane and Nettles; or let him take frequently in a Spoon the following Linctus. Take of Syrup of Purslain three ounces, of true Bole, Dragons blood, of the Troches of Spodium, and of sealed Earth, each two scruples; of Japan Earth one dram, of Gum-Tragacanth a sufficient quantity dissolved in Plantane-water; mingle them, make a Linctus. Or let him take thrice a day the quantity of a Nutmeg of the following Electuary. Take of the Conserve of red Roses one ounce, of the Troches of Ambar three drams, of true Bole, and of Dragons [Page 155](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/168:5.6?vid=65404) blood, each half a dram; with Syrup of Myrtles make an Electuary. Let him take also every night at Bed-time five or six Spoonfuls of the following Julep, shaking the Viol when he uses it. Take of Plantane-water six ounces, of Cinnamon-water hordeated three ounces, of distilled Vinegar half an ounce, of true Bole, and of Dragons blood, each half a dram; of London Laudanum three grains, of Syrup of Myrtles one ounce and an half; make a Julep. The Flux of Blood being stopt, we must endeavour by all means to raise the weak Blood with new and good Chyle, and to extinguish the Febrile Flame, if it be begun, least a Consumption should follow; wherefore the Sick must be frequently nourished with good Broths, and variety of Meats that are full of Nourishment, and of easie Digestion, and pleasant to the Stomach; but he must be sure to abstain from Wine, and from things salted and spiced; and because this sort of Sick, and all other that are inclining to a Consumption, are subject to Anger, Sorrow, Oppressions of the Hypochonders, Hysterick Passions, and want of Appetite; upon which account they can neither eat plentifully, nor digest well: They must endeavour to recreate themselves, and to take the Benefit of a wholsome and free Air, which most commonly does more good than Medicines. But if the Sick be Hectick, the Peruvian bark given freely is of admirable Vertue; and if there be occasion the Sick must use a Milk Diet, or Chalybeat Waters; but you must by no means Loosen the Body. A Consumption also often arises from a simple Gonorrhaea, and the Whites; also from Imposthumes and large Ulcers, and also from giving Suck, from a Loosness and Dysentery, from a Diabetes, from Salivation, a Dropsie, violent Sweating, and the like. But a Consumption of the Lungs is the chief: The Cause in general of it, is an ill Disposition of the whole Mass of Blood, and of the Nervous Spirit, contracted by degrees by the various Procatarctick Causes, whereby the [Page 156](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/169:5.6?vid=65404) Acrid and Malignant Serum of the Blood separated by the soft and glandulous Paranchyma of the Lungs, stuffs and inflames them, and at last causes Ulcers, which is indeed the containing Cause of this Disease. The Procatarctick Causes are first, a Suppression of the usual and necessary Evacuations, as of the Courses, the Lochia, of old Ulcers, of Issues, of Sweat by the Soles of the Feet, and other parts of the Body, and the like, without correcting and removing the Causes on which they depend; whereby the Blood is vitiated. Secondly, Great Passions of the Mind, especially Fear, Sorrow, Anger, deep Thinking, unseasonable and too hard Study, and the like. Thirdly, Eating and Drinking too much, and unseasonably, especially Drinking too much of Wine and Spirituous Liquors. Fourthly, Neglect of due Exercise. Fifthly, Long Watching. Sixthly, Marshy and gross Air, and Smoak of Coals. Seventhly, An Hereditary Disposition. Eighthly, An ill Conformation of the Breast. Ninthly, Contagion. Tenthly, Stones generated Preternaturally in the Lungs. Eleventhly, Particular Diseases which corrupt the Blood and Spirits. By these and such-like Procatarctick Causes, the Body being predisposed for a Consumption, the Disease takes its rise immediately from taking Cold. For the Cure of an original Consumption of the Lungs, Blood must be drawn from the Arm, especially if the Sick be Plethorick, or accustomed a long while to Blood-letting, and let six, seven, eight or ten Ounces be taken away. Secondly, It is requisite after Bleeding, especially if the Disease took its rise from a Surfet, or is accompanied with Nauseousness, or a Disposition to Vomiting, to give a gentle Vomit of Honey, or of Oxymel of Squills, and sometimes of the Vinum Benedictum in a moderate quantity: The Vomit, especially if the Sick bear it well, and if it be necessary, may be repeated three or four times at the distance of three or four days betwixt each Vomit: It is best to give the Vomit towards the Evening, the Sick being blooded the day before; and at Bed-time after every Vomit you must give an Anodyn. Take of Honey of Squills half an ounce, give it in a Draught of Posset-drink, and repeat twice or thrice in an hour, if the Sick does not Vomit enough. [Page 157](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/170:5.6?vid=65404)This is proper for Children and young People. Take of Oxymel of Squills, and of Oyl of Sweet-Almonds, each one ounce; mingle them, let the Sick, take it in a large Draught of Posset-drink, and let it be repeated twice or thrice in an hour if there be occasion. Or, Take of Vinum Benedictum seven drams, Syrup of Violets two drams; mix them and make a Potion for Vomiting. And, if it be needful, you may give of Oxymel of Squills and Oyl of Sweet-Almonds, each half an ounce, in a Draught of Posset-drink twice or thrice, in the Operation. Salt of Vitriol is not at all convenient in this case, because it irritates and pricks continually the Glandulous parts about the Jaws, and so promotes the Flux of the Serum, and increases the Cough. After the Vomit hath done working, give the following Opiat or the like. Take of the Pectoral Decoction clarified four ounces, of Tincture of Saffron two drams, of Helmont's liquid Laudanum fifteen drops, of Syrup of Violets two drams; mingle them, make a Draught; or you may give ten grains of the Pill of Hounds-tongue, or of Storax. Thirdly, It is convenient to Purge gently by Stool the Humours by Stomachick Purges, and the like, which the least agitate the Blood. For Instance, Take of choice Manna, and of Oyl of Sweet-Almonds, each one ounce and an half, or two ounces; dissolve them in a Pint of hot Ptisan; let the Sick drink half in Bed, and the rest half an hour after when he is up. Or, Take of the best Senna two drams, of Cassia with the Canes broke, and of Tamarinds, each half an ounce; of the Seeds of Coriander prepared half a dram; boil them in a sufficient quantity of Fountain or Barnet water to eight ounces; dissolve in it an ounce of Manna, and [Page 158](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/171:5.6?vid=65404) half a dram of Sal-prunella: Let the Sick take half in the Morning, and the rest half an hour afterwards. And every Night after Purging give an Opiate to asswage the Blood, and to quiet the Lungs, least a new Flux of Humours should fall upon the Lungs by the Agitation of the Blood occasioned by the Purge. For the same reason it is proper to mix some Opiate with Stomachick Purges to be taken at Bed Time. For Instance. Take of Aloes-rosat one scruple, or twenty five grains, of the Pills of Hounds-tongue half a Scruple; mingle them make four Pills to be gilded, which are to be repeated every other Night after the Patient hath been blooded. These Pills are vulgarly called Pilulae Catarrhales by the Apothecaries; for they do not only evacuate the Humours by Stool, but also hinder a new Flux of them to the Lungs. Or, Take of the Stomachick Pills, with Gums, Aleophagin of Mastich, or of Ambar, half a dram, or two scruples; of London Laudanum one grain; mingle them, make four Pills, gild them, and let them be taken every third Night for thrice. And if the Catarrh be very violent, and if a Difficulty of Breathing, or a straitness on the Breast does not arise from the Use of Opiates, an Opiat must be given every Night; for at the beginning of this Disease nothing considerable can be done without them. Fourthly, In this State of the Disease, Diaphorecticks do much Good; but you must take notice, that they must be never used before Bleeding, Vomiting and Purging, if they are necessary, and they must be always mixed with Opiates, and such must be chosen as are least hot. Take of venice-treacle half a dram or two scruples, of Conserve of old red Roses half a dram; mingle them, make a Bolus. Or, [Page 159](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/172:5.6?vid=65404)Take of Diascordium, and conserve of Wood-sorrel, each one dram, make a Bolus. Or, Take of Matthew's Pill fifteen grains; make two Pills, gild them, and let them be taken at bed-time. Or, Take of the Pill of Hounds-tongue twelve grains, of Diaphoretick Antimony one scruple, of Tincture of Saffron a sufficient quantity; mingle them, make four Pills. These Diaphoreticks must be taken at Bed-time, and great Care must be taken that the Sick does not take Cold after the use of them: Blisters must also be applyed to the Arms, and betwixt the Shoulders, and Pectoral Medicines must be used when the Sick does not Purge. Take of Oyl of sweet Almonds, of Syrup of Maiden-hair, of Jujubs, Violets, or of Marsh-mallows, each one ounce and an half; of White Sugar-candy one dram and an half; mingle them exactly, whereof let the Sick take a Spoonful every fourth Hour, drinking upon it four ounces of the following Apozem hot. Take of the Pectoral Decoction clarified one Pint and an half, of Tincture of Saffron extracted with treacle-water, of Syrup of Maiden-hair, Scabious, or of Jujubs, each one ounce; mingle them, make an Apozem. If you desire to have a more thickning Linctus. Take of fresh Oyl of sweet Almonds, of Syrups of Comfrey, of red-poppies, of dried Roses, each one ounce and an half; of Diacodium half an ounce, of Sugar of Roses one dram and an half; mingle them, make a Linctus. If you wou'd have a more lubricating Linctus. Take of fresh Oyl of Flax extracted without Fire, of Syrup of Liquorish, and of Honey of Violets, one ounce and an half; of white Sugar-candy one dram and an half, mingle them exactly, make a Linctus. [Page 160](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/173:5.6?vid=65404)If there be a Feaver, omit the Hissop and Tincture of Saffron; if there be a Loosness, use the following. Take of the Lohoch of the Lungs of a Fox, of Colts-foot, and Purslain, each one ounce; of Syrup of Jujubs, and Maiden-hair, each one ounce and an half; of Flowers of Sulphur two drams, of Tincture of Saffron half an ounce, of the Species Diatragacanth frigid, of Diamargit frigid, of the Powder of Haly, each one dram; of Penediat Sugar half an ounce; mingle them, make a Linctus. Take of Tacamahaca, of Balsam of Peru, each one Drain; of the Ingredients for the Pectoral Decoction a sufficient quantity, boil them in a sufficient quantity of Fountain Water to a Pint and an half; with the strained Liquor, and with a dram of each of the four Cold-seeds, with the Seeds of white Poppies, and of Henbane, each two drams; and with eight Almonds blanched, make an Emulsion to be sweetned with Pendiat-Sugar. But if by reason of the Clamminess of the Flegm the Difficulty of Breathing is more than usual, the following Linctus must be prescribed. Take of the Lohoch of Raisons, and of Squills, each one ounce and an half; of Syrup of Hedge-mustard, of Hyssop, and of Hore-hound, each one ounce and an half; of the Species Diaireos, Diacalaminth, and the Flowers of Sulphur, each one Dram and an half; Tincture of Saffron half an ounce, of white Sugar-candy six Drams; mingle them, make a Linctus. And if this Symptom be very violent, a dram of pure Gum-ammoniack, and a dram and an half of Flowers of Benzoin may be added. And for these Intentions, Balsamick Medicines, with things that agglutinate are proper. For Instance, Take of the Pulp of the conserve of red Roses, and Wood-sorrel, each one ounce and an half; of Olibanum three drams, of Opobalsam two scruples; mingle them, make an Electuary, whereof let the Sick take the quantity of a [Page 161](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/174:5.6?vid=65404) Nutmeg thrice a day, drinking upon it four ounces of the following Apozem. Take of the Leaves of Millfoil, Mouse-car, Burnet, Dandelion, spotted Lungwort, Scabious, the Flowers of St. John's-wort, Violets, the greater Daisy, red Poppies, each half an handful; of Jujubs, and Dates, each six Pair; of Saffron tied up in a Rag half a dram, of the Seeds of Annise, and Juniper-berries, each three drams; infuse them, and boil them in a sufficient quantity of Fountain-water to three Pints, in the hot Liquor strained dissolve four ounces of Conserve of red Roses, which being added to the Apozem render it Balsamick and Pleasantly tasted; strain it again, and add of the Syrups of Coral, and of Oak of Jerusalem, and of Maiden-hair, each one ounce, make an Apozem. Or instead of the foregoing Electuary the following may be substituted, Take of the Pulp of the conserve of red Roses two ounces, of the conserve of Hips one ounce, of the Powder of Haly one dram, of Lucatellus's Balsam half an ounce, of Balsamick Syrup a sufficient quantity; mingle them, make an Electuary to be taken as before. Let the Sick take often in a day one or two Spoonfuls of the Balsamick Syrup, which is very agreeable to the Stomach, and with every Dose of the Syrup, a scruple of the Balsam of Tolu made into small Pills, may be taken; and every Night at Bed-time the Sick may take twenty five or thirty drops of Helmont's liquid Laudanum in a spoonful of Balsamick Syrup: When there are no other Medicines to be taken, and there is nothing contrindicates it, it is also very effectual to prescribe a dram of Flowers of Sulphur to be taken in a rear Egg, or Honey of Rosemary-flowers. If a Tickling Cough, by reason of the Acrimony and Thinness of the Humuor, issuing from the Windpipe and Bronchia, be very troublesome to the Patient, the following Tablets must be used. [Page 162](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/175:5.6?vid=65404)Take of the Pulp of the Roots of Marsh-mallows one ounce, Pearl-sugar, Gum-arabick, Tragacanth, white Starch, dissolved in Poppy-water, each two drams; of Penediat Sugar dissolved in Rose-water a sufficient quantity; make Tablets, each weighing a dram. But if the Cough continues long, and is violent, and will not yield to the foregoing Remedies, we must use Balsamicks. For Instance, Let the Sick take thrice a day three of the following Pills, in a spoonful or two of some proper Linctus. Take of the Powder of Millepedes prepared three drams, of Gum-ammoniack well purified one dram and an half, of the Flowers of Benzoin two scruples or one dram, of Extract of Saffron, and Peruvian Balsam, each half a scruple; of Balsam of Sulphur anisated, or made with Turpentine, a sufficient Quantity; mingle them, make Pills of a moderte bigness, gild them, or cover them with Powder of Liquorish. These Pills have often done good in Consumptire Coughs. The Sick must chuse an Air that is moderately hot and dry, and somewhat thin; the diet must be of easie Concoction, as Mutton, and Veal, and the like; and the Sick must eat Flesh only at Dinner; at Supper he must only eat Water-gruel, Panada-broths, potched Eggs, and the like; and he must be sure to be moderate in his Diet; he must drink sparingly of small Beer, and the like; Wines must be avoided, and other spirituous Liquors; it is also convenient that his Beer be medicated with Pectoral things and the like, which are proper for the Disease; for by this means a great quantity of Medicines will be mixed with the Blood without nauseating the Stomach, or injuring the Appetite, which a Physician ought to take great Care of. For Instance, Take of the best Sarsa-parilla cut eight ounces, of the Roots of China sliced four ounces, of Polypody of the Oak, Maiden-hair, Ground-ivy, spotted Lung-wort, Colts-foot, Scabious, of Jerusalem, of the [Page 163](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/176:5.6?vid=65404) Flowers of Scabious, water-lillies, and of Rosemary, of the grater Daisy, and of St. Johns-wort, each one handful; of Juniper-berries four ounces, of Raisins of the Sun stoned six ounces, of Liquorish rasped one ounce, of the Seeds of Annise two drams; mingle uhem, make a Bag for four Gallons of middling Beer, which let the Sick use for his ordinary Drink. The Sick must exercise himself daily moderately, especially before Dinner; he must take great Care that he does not catch Cold: The Sick must be diverted as much as may be from Anger, Sorrow, deep thinking, and all other great Passions of the Mind; from Study, and unseasonable Watching, always sleeping, if he can, the first part of the Night. But in the second State of this Disease, which may be known by the Increase of the hectick Feaver, which now is often like a putrid Intermitting Feaver, and by the manifest wasting of the Flesh, by the dry Cough, a Weight upon the Breast, and difficulty of Breathing; all Evacuacuations by Stool, Vomit, or Sweat, are injurious; for they promote the Feaver, and Increase the Consumption: Nor is Bleeding to be used at this time, unless it be to prevent a Peripneumonia; but the Alteratives and Pectorals before prescribed must be used frequently, as often as the Stomach will bear them; but especially the use of the Balsamicks before prescribed must be long continued, if there be no considerable Feaver; and by this means many Consumptive People have been recovered. Issues are also of use, and the Shaving of the Head. And if the Hectick heat be but small, the Sick ought to drink Calybeat Waters in the Summer-time; for by this means many have been relieved Year after Year; their Stomack, Flesh and Strength recovered, and the Hectick Heat and Cough left them, and their Breath has been freer: But these Waters are not to be used when the Lungs are evidently putrified, or when the Flesh is very much wasted by Colloquative Sweats, a Loosness, or a Dropsie, for then they are deadly. And when they are proper, the Sick must use them the greatest part of the Summer, but not so great a quantity at a time as is usual in other Cases, two Quarts, five Pints, or three Quarts, may be sufficient [Page 164](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/177:5.6?vid=65404) at a time; and the Sick must take Care that he does not catch Cold, and of Errors in Diet: Purging is not to be used during the drinking of the Waters in this Case, but if the Body be subject to be bound, the Purging Mnieral-waters must be taken three or four times, at the distance of three or four Days before and after the use of the Calybeat-waters. If the Waters do not pass well by Urine, or if they cause a Diarrhea, you must not continue the use of them long, unless these Inconveniences may be remedied by Art, to take off or to prevent the Diarrhea. I use to prescribe the quantity of a Walnut of the following Electuary, to be taken at Bed-time every Night. Take of the Pulp of the conserve of old red Roses, of the Electuary of Quinces, each half an ounce; of the Troebes of Ambar three drams, of true Bole, of Dragons-blood, each half a dram; of London Laudanum three grains, of Syrup of Mirtles a sufficient Quantity; mingle them, make an Electuary. To force the Urine, I order that a scruple of the whitest Salt of Ambar, well cleansed from the Oyl, should be dissolved in the first Draught of Water. It is also good, during the Course of the Water, to medicate the ordinary Drink with a Bag of Pectoral Ingredients. But secondly, If the Hectick Feaver be considerable, it is safer to attemperate the Blood by a Milk-Diet; but as to a Milk Diet what followeth must be observed. First, In the use of this Diet, nothing but Milk, or things made of Milk, Bread only excepted, must be allowed of; but good Quantities of it must be taken frequently, least by reason of the Thinness of it, the Parts should be deprived of their due Nourishment. Secondly, This sort of Diet must be continued for the Space of a Month or two. Thirdly, Spring time is most seasonable for a Milk Course, for then the Herbs and Flowers, wherewith the Beasts are fed, flourish most. Fourthly, But if by reason of the Ferment of the Stomach being too acid, common Milk, as it sometimes happens, curdles, and so cannot be concocted; upon which account, Vomiting, Grips, and a Loosness follow; [Page 165](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/178:5.6?vid=65404) it is better to abstain from the use of it, and to endeavour to attemperate the Blood with Asses-milk: Concerning the use of which observe the following Directions. First, Give this Milk in the Morning, and let the Sick sleep a little in Bed afterwards; let it be given again at five in the Afternoon. Secondly, Nothing of a contrary Nature, whether Diet or Medicine must be taken till the Milk is concocted. Thirdly, You must give a Pint, or half a Pint at a time, or thereabout; for a great Quantity of this, or of common Milk, can neither be received nor concocted by the Stomach, but is usually cast out presently, either by Vomit or Stool, to the great Prejudice of the Sick; wherefore it is prudently ordered by Physicians, that as the Stomach is by degrees accustomed to this sort of Diet, so the quantity of it should be daily increased from half a Pint to a Pint. Fourthly, If the Sick, by reason of the acid Ferment of the Stomach, is subject upon taking Asses-milk, to a Loosness (which frequently happens) the Milk, must be sweetned with Sugar of Roses, and must be milked upon a Branch or two of Mint; and if there be occasion, and nothing forbids, the Sick may take every Night at Bed-time a grain of London Landanum, or a Dose of the beforementioned Astringent Electuary. Fifthly, The Milk must be drank whilst it is warm, for if it should grow cold, and be afterwards warmed upon the Fire, it would be rendered less pleasing to the Tast and Stomach, and the Remedy would not be so effectual, by reason of the Spirits being wasted. Sixthly, During the use of Asses-milk, which also ought to be ordered in every Milk-diet, the Sick must abstain from all other Medicines, except Opiats and Astringents, if they are necessary to prevent a Loosness, or to quiet the Cough at Nights. Seventhly, But if the Loosness, occasioned by the Milk, cannot be taken off by the Laudanum, and the Astringents, or if after it is taken off, Vomiting or at least a continual Sickness, or Weight upon the Stomach succeed, which are the certain Signs of the Milk curdling in the Stomach: Or lastly, If there be Signs of a Schirhus and Obstruction of the Liver, which are frequent in Scorbutical and Hypocondriack People, that have had a Consumption a long while, rhey must carefully avoid all sorts of Milk; for the use of Milk, by increasing the Obstruction [Page 166](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/179:5.6?vid=65404) of the Liver, is wont to bring upon the Consumption a Dropsie and Jaundice, whereby the original Disease is rendred deplorable. Wherefore, Fourthly, in these cases it is better to alter the Blood, and to blunt its Acrimony by the free use of Fish, and of testaceous Medicines; and also by Restorative Broths made of the extream parts of Animals, and drinking freely of the Compound Waters of Milk, Capons, and Snails, and the like; though what we said before of the use of Milk is also true, with respect to these Flegmatick Waters, viz. That when the Liver is obstructed, the Jaundice or Dropsie is wont to follow the free use of these. Wherefore in such a case it is better to endeavour to Sweeten the Blood in the following manner. Let him eat freely of River and Sea-crabs, of Lobsters; and generally speaking of all testaceous Fish, which sort of Diet eaten plentifully, much attemperates the Acidity of the Blood, and the sharp Ferment of the Stomach Of these testaceous Fish are also made very pleasant Broths, which must be taken plentifully. Take of River Crabs number an hundred, beat them whilst they are alive, and boil them in two quarts of Fountain-water; add towards the end of boiling two or three blades of Mace, one Nutmeg rasped, and of Malago-wine half a pint; strain it for use. Jellies and restorative Broths may be also used to the same purpose. For instance, Take of the Shavings of Harts-horn and Ivory, each four ounces; two blades of Mace, one bark of an Orange candied; boil them in two quarts of Fountain-water to a quart, or a pint and an half; strain it; let the Sick take three or four Spoonfuls, either by themselves or in some hot Broth. These kind of Jellies may be made more pleasant to the Pallate, by adding at the time of use a little of the Syrup of Baulm, Gilliflowers, Raspberries, Oranges or Lemmons; though it must be confessed Acid Syrups do not so well agree with Jellies. [Page 167](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/180:5.6?vid=65404)The manner of making a Restorative Broth is as follows. Take a Capon drawn and cut in pieces, of Sheeps and Calves feet, each two pair; the shavings of Ivory and Hartshorn, each half an ounce; two leaves of Mace, one Nutmeg cut, yellow Sanders, three drams or half an ounce; boil them all gently in one gallon of Fountain-water, till half is consumed; add towards the end of boiling a pint of Malago-Sack, and of the Flowers of the greater Daisie, Coltsfoot, Maiden-hair, Spotted Lungwort, each one handful; of fat Dates eight pair, of Jujubs twelve pair, of Sebestens ten pair, of Raisins of the Sun stoned three ounces; strain it, let the Sick take a large Draught of it twice or thrice a day. Prepared Coral, Millepedes, Pearls, Crabs-eyes prepared, the Simple Powder of Crabs-claws, and other testaceous Medicines taken plentifully, and often in a day, are good to blunt the Acrimony of the Blood. Take of the Aqua lactis Alexiteria, of Carduus, or of black Cherry-water, one pint; of Cinnamon-water hordeated half a pint, of prepared Pearl half an ounce, of white Cristaline Sugar two ounces; mingle them, make a Julep, whereof let the Sick take four ounces (shaking the Viol always when it is used) three or four times in a day, adding, if the Stomach require it, one or two ounces of Epidemick water. Or, Take of the Powder of Millepedes, of Crabs-eyes prepared, of the Simple Powder of Crabs-claws, each one dram; of the Powder of white Ambar half a dram; mingle them, divide it into nine Papers, whereof let him take one thrice a day in a Spoonful of the Pearl Julep. Fifthly, If the Sick seem free from an Obstruction of the Liver, and has neither the Dropsie nor the Jaundice, but the Milk-Diet before described does not agree, by reason of a Loosness, or the Acid Ferment of the Stomach; besides the altering Medicines above described, the free use of the compound distilled Waters of Milk, Snails, a [Page 168](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/181:5.6?vid=65404) Pig, and the like, may be ordered with success, to attemperate farther the Acrimony of the Humours. The Milk-water. Take of the leaves of Maiden-hair, Lungwort, each three Mint and Wormwood, each two handfuls; of the Flowers of St. John's Wort and Scabious, each two handfuls; of English Saffron one dram, three Nutmegs sliced, Dates and fat Figs, each half a pound; of Raisins of the Sun stoned one pound; cut them, and infuse them in three gallons of fresh Cows Milk, and three quarts of Malago-Sack, distill them in a cold Still, and draw off half the Liquor, and mix the Distillations, and keep them for use. If the Consumption be Scorbutical, you may add in Distillation the tops of Pine, Water-cresses, and Brook-lime, and Ground-Ivy, with other gentle Antiscorbuticks: And instead of Malago Sack, you may use Brunswick Mum. If you would have this Water also Restorative, you must add a Capon or a Pig in the second Distillation. For instance, Take a Capon or a Pig, (the Intrails being taken out) cut in pieces, of the Milk-water above described one gallon, distill off three parts of the Liquor. Snail-water. Take of Garden-Snails cleansed with Salt three hundred, of common Milk, or rather of the Milk-water above prescribed three gallons; distill them in a cold Still with a gentle Fire till the Liquor becomes Acid: And the following Magisterial water of Worms is not to be despised, for it will keep good a long while. Take of fresh Milk two gallons, of Mint and Roman Worm-wood, each two handfuls; distill off one gallon: Then take of Garden-Snails, first wash'd in common water, then in Small-beer, half a peck; of Earth-worms prepared [Page 169](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/182:5.6?vid=65404) one Pint, of Angelica one handful and an half, of Agrimony, Bettony and Rue, each one handful; put the Herbs into a Still, and the Snails and Worms upon them; and at top shavings of Harts-horn half a pound, Cloves one ounce, Saffron three drams; infuse them in two quarts of Syder, and one of Malago-Sack; then distill all in a cold Still. These Liquors are to be drank freely for the ordinary drink, mixed with an equal part of Milk, if the Stomach will bear it, and if the Sick can quench his Thirst with it. If a Julep be more pleasing, give it in the following manner. Take of the Waters of Pig or Capon before described one pint, of white Cristaline Sugar a sufficient quantity, boil them to a Syrup. Take of Milk, or Snail-water one pint and an half, of the Syrup just described four ounces; mingle them, make a Julep, whereof let the Sick drink freely. Or, Take of the Water of Milk, or of Magisterial Snail-water a quart, of pearled Sugar ten drams or an ounce and an half; mingle them, make a Julep, whereof let him take freely and frequently. But if there is not so much a Hectick Feaver as a difficulty of Breathing, as it often happens to such as are afflicted with a Scorbutick Consumption, a Pectoral Hydromel is better for the ordinary Drink, than distilled Waters abounding with Flegm. Take of the roots of China sliced six ounces, of the roots of Coltsfoot gathered at a Fit-time three ounces, of the roots of Burdock and Avens, each three ounces; of the roots of Elecampane two ounces, of the leaves of Lungwort, all the Scabious, both the Speedwells, Meadow-sweet, and Monywort, each two handfuls; of all the Capillaries, each one handful; of the flowering tops of Bugles and Bettony, of the flowers of red Speedwell, and of Cowslips, each four Pugils; of all the Ground Ivy three [Page 170](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/183:5.6?vid=65404) handfuls, of Jujubs, Dates, Sebestens, and Raisins of the Sun cleansed, each one ounce and an half; of Spanish Liquorish one ounce and an half, cut them all, and boil them in sixteen quarts of Fountain-water with a gentle Fire till half is consumed; strain it and clarifie it, and add to it four pound of the best Honey; boil it again, and take off the Scum; strain it again, add half an ounce of Cinnamon, six drams of Coriander-seed, of the Seeds of Annise and Sweet Fennel, each three drams; put the Liquor into a large Tub, and let it ferment, which it will the sooner do, if the Tub be placed in the Sun, for then it will be sufficiently fermented in forty days, otherwise it will require a much longer time: The Vessel must be always kept open and full. Of this let the Sick drink a good Draught twice or thrice a day for many Months. When the Consumption comes to its third State, the Sick very rarely is cured or lives long, unless the Ulcers are very small and benign; wherefore, though a prudent and honest Physician, being called to Consumptive People at this time, may endeavour to mitigate as much as may be the Symptoms, and may prescribe Medicines proper for the Consumption and the present Indications; yet he ought by no means to promise a Cure, but rather acquaint the Patient of his Danger; and so he will secure his own Reputation, and that of the Medical Art. The Curative Indications at this time of the Disease are these four: First, Pectoral Medicines must be prescribed, and the Cure of the Ulcers must be promoted (if they are small, benign and curable) as much as can be, in this weak and wasting Condition of the Sick. Secondly, The Peripneumonick or Inflammatory Feaver, as often as it happens, must be taken off, with all its dreadful Symptoms. Thirdly, The Putrid Feaver arising from the Purulent Matter of the Lungs must be mitigated. Fourthly and lastly, The Tormenting Symptoms arising from the Putrid Feaver by reason of the Colliquation, must be removed as far as may be, that at least the Sick may dye easily. As to the first in this State of the Consumption, Altering, Expectorating and Balsamick, or Healing Medicines [Page 171](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/184:5.6?vid=65404) that are not too hot, (by reason of the great height of the Feaver) but always Cordials are to be given, and those are to be chosen that are most palatable, and may be taken in the smallest quantity. For instance, Take of the Pulp of the old Conserve of red Roses, of Wood-sorrel, and of Lucatellus's Balsam, each one ounce; mingle them, make an Electuary, whereof let him take the quantity of a Nutmeg wrapt in a Wafer Morning and Evening; or let him take twice a day of the Balsamick Pills above described, number three. Take of the Aqua Lactis Alexiteria eight ounces, of the Magisterial Water of Snails, Cinnamon-water hordeated, each three ounces; Aqua mirabilis one ounce; of prepared Pearl two drams, of clear Ghalk one dram, of white Cristaline Sugar one ounce or ten drams; mingle them, make a Julep, whereof let the Sick take four or five Spoonfuls after every Dose of the Electuary, and of the Pills, and as often as he will. Take of the Balsamick Syrup, which is very agreeable to the Stomach, three ounces; of Tincture of Saffron made in Treacle-water two drams; mingle them, let him take of it often in a Spoon, and in a Spoonful or two of this mixture, let him take twice a day six or eight drops of Opobalsam. But if the Cough and Watchings are very obstinate, let him take sometimes twelve drops of Helmont's Liquid Laudanum. Nevertheless in this languid state, Opium ought to be given cautiously in small Doses, and in due distances of time; neither ought it to be given at all without urgent necessity require it, least a sudden Death follow, and the Disgrace of the Medical Art. Or, Take of the Syrup of Maiden-hair four ounces, of Aqua mirabilis half an ounce or six drams; mingle them; let the Patient take a Spoonful of it frequently, or with a Liquorish-stick, especially when the Cough is troublesome. [Page 172](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/185:5.6?vid=65404)Jellies and Restorative Broths are to be prescribed in this case: And indeed in this deplorable Condition, Medicines are rather to be taken from the Kitchin than the Apothecary's Shop. As to the Peripneumonick Feaver, it arises always from the great Inflammation of the Tubercles of the Lungs; and therefore it uses to return frequently, viz. As often as a new Tubercle either of its own accord, or from cold taken, or from any Error committed in Diet, happens to be inflamed; and during the Inflammation this Feaver continueth, and often kills the Patient suddenly; it being accompanied with uncertain Shivering, and violent Heat succeeding alternately, with Watching, Restlesness, a Delirium, difficulty of Breathing, difficulty of Expectoration, violent and wandring Pains of the Side, Breast and Shoulders; but when the Inflammation first begins to Imposthumate, which, if the Sick lives, happens usually about the seventh day of the Disease, the continual Inflammatory Feaver is succeeded by a Putrid Intermitting Feaver, either Quotidian or Tertian, which certainly indicates Matter in the Tubercles, and can never be perfectly eradicated unless they be cured. This Inflammatory Feaver, as all others of the same kind, requires a thin Diet, that the Belly should be kept open, and Cordial and Attemperating Juleps are to be used freely; also Pectoral Apozems, and Lubricating and Inciding Linctuses, to facilitate the Expectoration of the Flegm, too much thickned by the Feaverish Heat, and to take off the painful Compression of the Lungs, and to ease the Cough. Diaphoretick Opiats are also to be used sparingly, at due Intervals, to promote the Expulsion of the Febrile Matter through the Pores of the Skin: Also Blisters and Epithems are to be used for the relief of the Brain, and Genus Nervosum, which would otherwise suffer much by Feavers of this kind. Liniments also and Anodyn Fomentations must be prescribed, to remove the Painful and Convulsive Contraction of the Muscles, and Membranes of the Breast; but above all, Bleed seasonably and largely, and it must be repeated, if there be occasion, according to the Strength of the Sick, and the present Effervescence of the Blood; and perhaps Consumptive People require Bleeding more than those that are strong. [Page 173](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/186:5.6?vid=65404)Wherefore the Physician, though he count the Consumption deadly, ought to endeavour the Cure of the Peripneumonia in the following manner: Let him order a Diet of Water-gruel, Ptisan, roasted Apples, and the like, and middling Beer with a Toast in it: But at the first Declination of the Feaver, Chicken-broth, potched-Eggs, and the like. And the Belly, if there be occasion, must be presently loosned, with a Glister made of Milk and Sugar, with Camomil-flowers, which also must be repeated upon occasion; then eight or ten Ounces of Blood must be taken away from the Arm of the pained Side; and Bleeding must be repeated every day, or every other day, according to the Effervescence of the Blood, and the Violence of the Pain in the Side, and of the difficulty of Breathing, if the Strength will permit that an Imposthumation may be hindred if possible. In the mean while, through the whole Course of the Disease, one Spoonful of the following Linctus dissolved in four Ounces of the Pectoral Apozem, must be taken every third or fourth hour hot. Take of the fresh Oyl of Sweet-Almonds, of Syrup of Maiden-hair, each one ounce and an half; of white Sugar-candy one dram and an half; mingle them exactly and make a Linctus. And if the Flegm be very tough, and if the Difficulty of Breathing and the Pain increase by reason of it, instead of Oyl of Almonds, Oyl of Linseed fresh drawn without Fire may be substituted, and Syrup of Hedge-mustard, or of the five opening Roots instead of Syrup of Maiden-hair, if a Flux of the Belly does not contra-indicate: Besides two or three ounces of the Oyl of Linseed may be taken by it self every fourth Hour, for it does not only Lubricate, but is also very Anodyn. Take of the Pectoral Decoction clarified one Pint and an half, of Tincture of Saffron made in Treacle-water, and of Syrup of Maiden-hair, each one ounce; mingle them, make an Apozem for the use above described. [Page 174](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/187:5.6?vid=65404)To recruit the Strength, and to attemperate the Effervescence of the Blood, four or five Spoonfuls of the following Julep may be prescribed. Take of the Aqua-lactis alexiteria eight ounces, of Cinnamon-water hordeated, and of Plague-watery each two ounces; of prepared Pearl one dram and an half, of white Sugar six drams; mingle them, make a Julep. At Bed-time the following Anodyn and Diaphoretick Bolus may be prescribed to be taken, with a Draught of the Cordial Julep, especially if the Belly, as it often happens in this State of the Disease, be too loose. Take of Venice-treacle half a dram, of the compound Powder of Crabs-claws one Scruple, of Syrup of Gilly-flowers a sufficient Quantity; mingle them, make a Bolus. Presently after Bleeding apply Blisters to the Neck, to the inner parts of the Arms and Legs, and a Cephalick Plaister with Euphorbium to the Soles of the Feet, to relieve the Brain and Genus Nervosum. To ease the Pain of the Side occasioned by the Convulsions of the Muscles and the Membrans of the Breast, the following Fomentation and Liniment may be applyed by turns to the Parts affected. Take of the Roots of Parsly and Fennel, and of Linseeds, and of Fenugreek-seeds, each two ounces; of the Flowers of Camomel, and of Melilot, each two handfuls, mix them and boil them in a sufficient quantity of Fountain Water, pour it into a fresh Ox-Bladder, let the Bladder be half full, apply it hot to the Parts affected; when the Bladder is taken off, apply an hot Flannel besmeared with the following Liniment. Take of Ointment of Marsh-mallows half an ounce, of Oyl of white-lillies, and of Bricks, each three drams; mingle them, make a Liniment. [Page 175](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/188:5.6?vid=65404)To attemperate further the Effervescence of the Blood and the Heat of the Lungs, the following Powder may be used with good Success, Take of pure Salt-peter two drams, of white Cristaline Sugar half an ounce, mingle them, and make of them eight Papers, whereof let one be dissolved in every Draught of Beer. As to other things they must be left to the Judgment of the Physician that attends, to be prescribed upon Occasion. As to the putrid Feaver of Consumptive People, it is to be noted, that although the Sick being treated according to the Preceeding Method, do not die of a Peripneumonia, yet the Inflammation of the Tubercles of the Lungs ending most commonly in an Ulcer, presently after the Inflammatory Feaver, a putrid intermitting Feaver arises, returning at certain Periods every day or every other day with Shivering, Heat and Sweats. Which Feaver seems impossible to be taken quite off unless the Ulcer be cured from whence it arises; yet the Peruvian Bark, frequently repeated at due Intervals, is often very Successful for suppressing the Feaver for a while, and the Lives of some, by the frequent use of it, have been protracted for many Years. Take of the Peruvian Bark finely powdered half a dram, of the Balsamick Syrup a sufficient quantity; make a Bolus, which let the Sick take in the Morning, and every sixth Hour for three days successively, drinking upon it three or four ounces of the following Apozem. Take of the Peruvian Bark powdered three ounces, of the Balsam of Tolu two drams, of English-saffron, and Cochinele, each one Scruple; boil them in a Pint of the Pectral Decoction clarified to six ounces, then strain it, and put on a Pint more of the Decoction; repeat the Operation thrice, then mix all the strained Liquor, and add to it of Maligo Saek, and Balsamick Syrup, each fou ounces; mingle them, an Apozem. [Page 176](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/189:5.6?vid=65404)Repeat the use of this Febrifuge in the manner now described twice in a Month, or oftner if there be Occasion; and in the Intervals, the daily use of Balsamick and Pectoral Medicines must be ordered, and they must be varied according to the Temper of the Sick, and the Genius of the Disease: If the Belly be too loose, a grain of London Laudanum may be added to every Bolus to be taken at Bed-time, or instead of the Bolus's, Pills made of Diascordium, and the Jesuits Powder may be substituted; but every Dose must contain half a dram of the Powder, Yet it must be confessed that the Bark is not constantly so successful in the Consumptive Feaver as in Agues. To take off a Loosness, and to mitigate a Dysentery, and the Gripes, Opiat Medicines must be used freqently and freely; and during these Symptoms, the Sick must abstain from all sorts of Beer, and, instead of it, must use the white Decoction or Milk-water: Let him take also, if there be Occasion, every fourth Hour, the quantity of a Walnut of the Astringent Electuary described before in the use of Asses-milk; or let him take twelve Drops of Helmont's liquid Laudanum, And to attemperate the Acrimony of the Humours, that are wont to be evacuated by the glandulous Tunick of the great Guts, and to restore the Tone of the Parts weakned thereby, let a Glister be daily injected made of Chicken broth or of a Sheeps-head with the Wool on, boiled in Water, or this that follows. Take of Milk altered with red Roses, and by quenching often hot Steel in it; six ounces, of Diascordium half an ounce; mingle them, make a Glister. But in a moderate Diarrhea, viz. when the Gripes are not very violent, especially if there be a Difficulty of Breathing, Opium must be prescribed rarely and sparingly in any Form; for most commonly upon giving it, the Breast is oppressed, and Breathing, and Expectoration are rendered more difficult, and the Stomach becomes nauseous. [Page 177](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/190:5.6?vid=65404)Wherefore it is safer only to moderate the Loosness, by giving an Opiat every third or fourth Night, than to stop it quite; least a greater Injury should follow; and always after the use of an Opiat, expectorating and lubricating Medicines should be freely used; least the Matter should be so much fixed in the Lungs, that the strength of the Patient should not suffice to bring it up. When the Cough and Watchings are very violent, the following Medicines may be used; but it is to be noted, that Opiats must be used very sparingly, and with great Caution when the Sick is very weak. Take of Syrup of Marsh-mallows, and Purslain, each one ounce and an half; of the Species Diatragacanth frigid, of the Powder of Haly, each two scruples; of Diacodium an ounce and an half, mingle them, make a Linctus to be taken in a spoon, or with a Liquorish Stick, when the Cough is violent. Aqua-mirabilis also mixed with Pectoral Syrups does good. Or, Take of the Balsamick Syrup two ounces, of Helmont's liquid Laudanum two Scruples; mingle them, let the Sick take a spoonful every Hour or every other Hour, The white and black Lozenges being leisurely dissolved in the Mouth, and swallowed down, are also of use. To moderate the great and Colliquative Sweats, let the Sick sleep but little at a time, and let him take temperate Pearl Cordials often, and in a large Quantity; to which it is fit to add Chalk, Coral, Dragons-blood, and other temperating astringent and emplastick Medicines, which in some manner fix and mitigate the Ferment of the Blood. For Instance, Take of the Waters of Tormentil, Oak-buds, each three ounces; Cinnamon-water hordiated four ounces, of Aqua-mirahilis one ounce, of Pearls, and Coral prepared, and of Chalk, each two scruples; of true Bole, and Dragons-blood each half a dram; of Japn Earth a scruple, of destilled Vinegar or Spirit of Vitriol as much as is sufficient [Page 178](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/191:5.6?vid=65404) to make it gratefully acid, Syrup of Mirtles an ounce and an half; Mingle them, make a Julep; let the Sick take two or three ounces of it every third or fourth hour, shaking the Viol every time it is used. The Cloaths on the Bed must be also lessened, and the Sick must be removed into a thin, warm and free Air; let him always sleep in a large Room, and as soon as his Strength begins to fail, the Sweat must be rubbed off with dry Linnen Cloaths a little warmed; and the Patient must be removed to the other Part of the Bed. As to the violent Vomiting that seises Consumptive Persons at the latter end, there is little Help to be afforded by Art, only the Physician ought to assist by his prudent Counsels since he cannot by Medicines. First therefore, The Sick ought to be ordered to eat little (though frequently) at a time. Secondly, He must eat those things that afford good Nourishment and are of easie Digestion. Thirdly, After eating he must avoid (as much as he can) Coughing, Sleeping, and lying down. Sometimes it happens after the Putrid Feaver begins especially if the Evacuation of the Colliquative Matter by Stool or by other ways is hindered by Art, that Nature indeavours, tho in vain, the Protrusion of the Enemy by the Salivary Ducts, or the glandulous Tunick of the Mouth and Oesophagus, by which means a troublesome Spitting arises that continues for many Weeks. Secondly, by reason of the Acrimony of the Humour evacuated by these Parts, an Inflammation not only of the Membrane of the Mouth, but also of the Oesophagus and Stomach follows. Thirdly, By the Inflammation an Ulceration is occasioned, and from thence little Ulcers called Aphth, accompanied with a very troublesom Pain of the Throat. And Lastly, An Hicop that is very troublesom arises from the Inflammation and Exulceration. Which Symptoms, as they are troublesome, so are they sometimes long, and always deadly, for the Cause from whence they proceed is incurable; yet cleansing softning astringent and Mucilaginous Gargarisms must be injected with a Syringe; and to ease the Pain of the Throat, a double Flannel worn about the Neck does much Good, by defending it from the external Cold. [Page 179](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/192:5.6?vid=65404) CHAP. LX. Of Swooning or Fainting. THe next and immediate Cause of this Disease, is a Defect of the Vital Spirits; and this Defect of the Spirits chiefly happens four ways, Either because there is not a sufficient quantity of them generated, or because they are dissipated and evacuated when they are generated; or they are preternaturally altered, and corrupted: Or lastly, They are suffocated and overwhelmed. They are not generated either by reason of a Fault of the Faculty, or of the Matter; the Faculty of the generating the Spirits is hurt, either by a Peculiar Disorder of the Heart or by Consent. The peculiar Diseases of the Heart that are chiefly to to be taken Notice of, are great Intemperies overturning the native Temper of it; or destroying the Substance of the Parts, and of the Native Heat; as acute and malignant Feavers, Colliquative, Pestilential and Hectick also Organical Diseases, as Constriction and too great Dilatation. The Faculty of the Heart is hurt by Consent, as from the Brain and Liver, which have a great Sympathy with it; and also often from the Mouth of the Stomach, by reason of its nearness and Exquisite Sense, upon which account Swooning is divided into Cardiack and Stomachick; that is Cardiack which proceeds from the Heart being Primarily affected; that is Stomachick which is produced by Consent of the Stomach: It also often arises from the Womb, by reason of ill Vapours transmitted thence to the Heart. The Fault of the Matter, is a Defect or Corruption of the Air and Blood, from whence the Vital Spirits are generated. A Defect of the Air happens from Respiration or Transpiration hurt: A Defect of the Blood from a Fault in Nutrition. The Corruption of both is occasioned by putting on another Quality; so from the infected Air in a Pestilential Constitution, Swooning and Fainting frequently happen, [Page 180](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/193:5.6?vid=65404) and some ill Smells occasion the same, and sweet Smells in some Women. The Blood is also often corrupted by unwholesome Food. Too large Evacuations dissipate the Spirits, both sensible and insensible: sensible Evacuatioins, are first of Blood it self by the Mouth, Nostrils, Womb, Belly, Hemorrhoids, Bleeding, and great Wounds. Secondly, of other Humours, which though they are Excrementitious, yet being evacuated in a large quantity, they dissipate the Spirits and occasion Fainting. Such Humours are wnt to be evacuated by Vomit, Stool, Urine, Sweat, by opening a large Abscess, especially inwardly, as of an Empyema; and also outwardly, as in a Dropsie, the Navel being open. Insensible Evacuations are made by too great a rarity of the Skin, and by reason of Thinness or Acrimony of things contained, by immoderate Heat, Bathing and excessive Labour. They are also dissipated by long, Watching, long Fastting, immoderate Venery, Anger or excessive Joy; long and acute Sickness, violent Pains of the Heart, Stomach, Bowels, Veins, Ears, Teeth, and of all the Nervous Parts. The Spirits are altered and corrupted by an ill Disposition of the Bowels, and by any thing that has a malignant and an inimical Quality to the Heart; as a venomous and pestilential Air drawn in by the Breath, or generated in the Body by Putrefaction of Humours; Poison taken inwardly does the same, and the Biting of Venomous Creatures. Lastly, A violent Reflux of the Spirits and Blood to the Heart, and the like, suffocates and overwhelms the Vital Spirits. A noble Virgin, which was very subject to fainting upon every small occasion, died suddenly, by reason of a sudden Reflux of the Blood, and Spirits to the Heart, as she was about to sign a Contract of Marriage with a very handsom and accomplished Gentleman. Fainting also sometimes happens from cold and thick Blood, heapt up in abundance in the greater Vessels. As to the Cure, it must be varied according to the Variety of the Causes; but from whatever Cause it proceeds, that which follows must be observed in the Fit, You must lay them on their Back, and sprinkle Water in their [Page 181](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/194:5.6?vid=65404) Faces, and provoke Sneezing; put some good Wine or Cinnamon-water into their Mouths; apply Bread hot out of the Oven to their Nostrils; call them aloud, shake them, pull them by the Nose, double their Fingers, pull their Hair, use Frictions, Ligatures and Cupping-glasses. But the Cure must be varied according to the Variety of the Causes in the following manner. If it takes its Rise from want of Nourishment, the Sick must be refreshed with good Wine, and by a Piece of Bread dipt in it and eaten, and also by nourishing Broths, and the like. If by reason of the Thinness of the Humours, the Spirits exhale, Perfumes and meat of good Juice and Thickning must be prescribed, and the Pores of the Skin must be stopt with Oyl of Roses and by the cold Air. If it proceed from an Hysterick Disease, Remedies proper for that must be given; if from a malignant Quality Cardiacks and Alexipharmicks must be used. If from taking Poyson, things that evacuate must be used; a Vomit must be given, and afterwards Treacle must be prescribed; and then if a Heat and Erosion of the Stomach be perceived, he must take Milk or Butter, or fat Broths, or cooling Cordial Potions. If from Immoderate Evacuation, the Sick must be refreshed with Perfumes, Meat and Drink, Sleep and Rest. If from too great a Loss of Blood, lay the Sick on a Bed with his Head downward, Sprinkle his Face with cold Water, give him a little Wine diluted with cold Water. If by over-purging, give new Treacle; or for want of it old Treacle with two grains of Opium; or rather with three grains of Laudanum dissolved in Wine. Anoint his Belly with the following Oyls. Take of Oyl of Mirtles, and of Quinces, each one ounce and an half; of Oyl of Wormwood one ounce, of Rose Vinegar a little; mingle them, anoint his Belly with it often. Inject a Glister of Calybeat Milk, adding to it the Yolks of three Eggs, of Philonium Romanum two drams; rub his Arms and upper Parts; dip a Piece of Bread in Wine and give it, or let him drink Wine it self. [Page 182](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/195:5.6?vid=65404)And lastly, Every Evacuation, whether of Blood by the Nostrils, Womb, or other parts, or of other Humours, by Vomit or Stool, is to be restrained by Remedies described in their proper Chapters. That Fainting which arises from too great Sweat, must be cured by Remedies that restrain Sweat, as with cold Water, Rose-water alone, or with a little Vinegar in it cast upon the Hands and Face; the Air also must be cooled with the foresaid Waters, and with fanning; cold Epithems must be applied to the Heart, made of Rose-water, Sorrel, Borrage, and of the Powder of Diamargarit; frigid, and with a little Wine to make them penetrate. Also cooling Juleps of Syrup of Sorrel, Violets, of Apples, or Lemmons, with cooling Waters, and Sal-prunella, are frequently to be given; the Pores may be stopt by anointing the Skin with Oyl of Roses, Mastich and Myrtles. Let the Sick abstain from Wine; he must by no means be rubbed; let him often change place, and be lightly covered; let the Bed be sprinkled with the following Powder. Take of the flowers of Water-lillies, and red Roses, each three ounces; of pure Labdanum half an ounce, of Storax two drams, of Myrtles, and the Grains of Sumach, each two ounces; make a Powder. If the Fainting arise from Suffocation of the Spirits, they must be called back to the Surface of the Body, by Frictions, Ligatures, Cupping-glasses, and the like; but if the Suffocation arise from Fullness, Blood must be drawn plentifully by Intervals; if Fainting proceed from a Fright or Fear, Blood must be also let, least an Obstruction or Inflammation should be occasioned. [Page 183](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/196:5.6?vid=65404) CHAP. LXI. Of the Palpitation of the Heart, and of the Trembling of it. THE Palpitation of the Heart is so violent sometimes, that it may not only be manifestly felt, but also seen and heard at some distance: And some Authors of note say, That by the violent Vibration of the Heart, the Ribs have been broke, or thrust out in young People. As to the Cure, it must be varied according to the variety of the Causes. First therefore, when this Disease proceeds from a fault in the Blood, the curative Intention will be, to exalt the watry Blood, and to render it more apt for Fermentation; to which purpose Spiritous Medicines, also Saline of every sort and Sulphurous, especially Chalybeats; and also those things which are used for the Green-sickness, or Lucophlegmatia, and a cold Scurvy, do good. Take of the Conserves of Roman Wormwood, of the yellow Peel of Oranges and Lemons, each two ounces; of the Winteran bark powdered two drams, of the Species Diacurcuma one dram, of Steel prepared with Sulphur three drams, Salt of Wormwood one dram and an half, with a sufficient quantity of the Syrup of Citron-bark; make an Electuary. The Dose is the quantity of a Nutmeg in the Morning, and at five a Clock in the Afternoon, drinking upon it three Ounces of the following Julep, and walking after it. Take of the Waters of Wake-robin leaves one pint, of Penny-royal and Hyssop, each four ounces; of the water of Worms, Snails, and Mirabilis, each one ounce; of Sugar one ounce; mingle them, make a Julep. [Page 184](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/197:5.6?vid=65404)Take of the Tincture of Antimony one ounce. The Dose is twenty or twenty five drops twice a day in the same Julep. Moreover, Tincture of Steel, or the Syrup of it, also Elixir Proprietatis are proper. Secondly, The Palpitation of the Heart is oftner and much more violent from a fault in the Cardiack Arteries, which is either an Obstruction or a Convulsion. The first is most commonly continual, and often incurable, especially if it be occasioned by tabid Lungs, or by reason the roots of the Arteries are half filled or compressed by a Tubercle, or bony Excrescence; which Causes, when they are and can be perfectly known, it is to no purpose to endeavour to remove; and then all that can be done, is only to give ease by Hypnoticks. Moreover, It is probable, that the passage of the Blood is hindred, sometimes by a Polypus growing within the Sinus of the Heart: But it is difficultly known, and hardly cured; when there is a Suspicion of it, Saline Medicines seem most proper, and of those such as are volatile or acid: But they are not to be given together, you are to try one sort first, and if that does not do, you must try the other. Take of Compound Spirit of Sal-armoniack, viz. distilled with Millepedes, or with other anti-asthmaticks, three drams. The Dose is from fifteen Grains to twenty thrice a day, in some proper Julep or distilled Water. In the same manner Spirit of Harts-horn, of Soot, of Blood, and of a Scull dug up, may be tried. Take of Spirit of Sea-salt, or of Vitriol, distilled with Spirit of Wine, impregnated with Pectoral Herbs, and often cohobated, three drams. The Dose is from fifteen to twenty drops. Spirit of Tartar, of the Wood of Gujacum, or of Box, may be used to the same purpose. [Page 185](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/198:5.6?vid=65404)Thirdly, The Palpitation of the Heart is often Convulsive, and proceeds from the same cause as other Hypochondriack or Asthmatick Passions do, and must be cured also by Antispasmotick Remedies; but respect must be had to the Constitution of the Sick. Take of Spirit of Sal-armoniack with Ambar three drams. The Dose is from fifteen to twenty drops twice a day, in some proper Julep or distilled Water. Tincture of Tartar, of Steel, or of Antimony, may be also given by turns. As to the Cure of the Trembling of the Heart, Medicines proper for Convulsions must be given, it being meerly Convulsive. Wherefore having made sufficient Evacuation, the follow Medicines may be given. Take of prepared Coral, and of Pearls, each two drams; of both the Bezoars, each half a dram; of white Ambar two scruples, of Ambar-grease one scruple; make a Powder. The Dose is half a Dram twice or thrice in a day, in some proper Julep or distilled Water. Take of Compound Powder of Crabs-claws two drams, of the Powder of the roots of Male-peony, of Mans Skull prepared, each one dram; of the flowers of Male-peony, and of Lillies of the Vallies, each half a dram; make a Powder to be taken the same way. Take of Ivory, and red Coral powdered, each three drams; of the Species Diambra one dram, of white Sugar dissolved in a sufficient quantity of Orange-flower-water and boiled to Tablets, seven ounces; make Tablets each weighing half a dram: Let him take one or two often in a day, or when he pleases. Take of the Conserve of the Flowers of Lillies of the Vallies six ounces, of Coral prepared, of Pearls, Ivory, and Crabs-eyes, each one dram and an half; of Vitriol of Mars one dram, with a sufficient quantity of Syrup of Coral, make an Electuary. The Dose is one or two drams twice a day, drinking upon it a Draught of the following Julep. [Page 186](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/199:5.6?vid=65404)Take of the Waters of Orange-flowers, and of the whole Citron, each six ounces; of Orange-peels distilled with Wine two ounces, of Sugar half an ounce; make a Julep. Take of Syrup of Steel six ounces. The Dose is one Spoonful in the Morning and at five in the Afternoon, in two ounces of the Julep above prescribed; but you must omit the Sugar. Take of the Powder of Ivory, and of Coral, each two drams and an half; of the Species of Diambra one dram, of Salt of Steel two drams, of Sugar eight ounces, of Ambar-grease dissolved half a scruple; make Tablets, each weighing half a dram. The Dose is three or four drams twice a day. Tae of fresh Strawberries eight Pints, of the outward Peel of twelve Oranges, of the fresh Filings of Steel half a pound, beat them together, and pour upon them four quarts of Wine: Let them ferment together in a close Vessel twenty four hours; then distill them in a cold Still. Take of Spirit of Harts-horn, or of Blood, or the like, three drams. The Dose is twenty drops twice a day in some proper Vehicle. Take of the Flowers of Sal-armoniack, and of Coral prepared, each two drams. The Dose is one scruple twice a day. Take of Sal-prunella two drams, of Salt of Ambar one dram, of Salt of Harts-horn one Scruple. The Dose is from fifteen to twenty grains twice a day in some proper Liquor. Note, Such of these Medicines as agree with the Constitution of the Patient are to be chosen. [Page 187](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/200:5.6?vid=65404) CHAP. LXII. Of Weakness. THE Cause of Weakness, is a Defect of Native Heat, and of Spirits: This Defect is occasioned by the Defect of Vital Spirits: The Vital Spirits are wanting, either when they are not generated in a sufficient quantity, or because, when they are generated, they are dissipated, corrupted, or suffocated, as it happens in Fainting: But the difference betwixt Fainting and Weakness is, That in Fainting the Causes produce their Effect of a sudden, but in Weakness by degrees. The Cure of this Disease respects the taking away the Cause, and the cherishing the Heart and Vital Spirits. The Causes are, almost all great Diseases, whereby Nature is much weakned; therefore the taking off the Causes, respects the Cure of almost all Diseases, which must be sought for in their proper Chapters. But the Strengthning the Heart, and the Restoration of the Vital Spirits, are to be treated of a part, and sometimes to be preferred before the Cure of the Morbifick Causes, when there is danger of Death: But you must always take care, that whilst you endeavour to refresh the Spirits, you do not increase the Morbifick Causes; and therefore in a hot Disease you must give temperate Cordials, in a cold such as are hot. And first, With Meat you must mix Cordials, as Confection of Alkermes, or of Hyacinth in Broths; also Mutton Broth, the Fat and Skin being cut off, is good; also Gravy of Mutton is frequently used, and the Gravy of the Heart is mightily commended. The Italians make a Soop of Yolks of Eggs, Wine, Sugar and Cinnamon, which is very restorative. Jelly of Harts-horn is also very good. Cordial Juleps may be also prepared in the following manner. [Page 188](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/201:5.6?vid=65404)Take of the Waters of Bugloss, Roses, and the Flowers of Oranges, each one ounce; of Syrup of Apples, and of Lemons, each half an ounce; Confection of Alkermes half a dram, of Cinnamon-water two drams; make a Julep. To the Stomach may be applied Bags made of Spices, and moistned with Wine; the private parts may be fomented with Confection of Alkermes dissolved in Wine: The Arteries of the Temples, the Hands and Feet may be anointed with the same. And Apoplectick Balsam may be often held to the Nostrils. CHAP. LXIII. Of Appetite depraved, diminished, and abolished. THE Cause of an excessive Appetite, is a sharp Juice abounding in the Body, and especially brought from the Pancreas to the Intestine; and sending thence Vapors that are sharper than usual to the Stomach. This Acid is increased in the whole Body by sharp Meats, and Drinks, Cold and Serene Air, immoderate Grief continued long, violent Motion, and long Watching. The Appetite is diminished by Fat Choler, and by Fat and Viscid Meat, by Hot or Rainy Weather, by too much Sleep, Sloath and great Cares. The Causes that diminish Appetite will wholly abolish it, if they are extream. Depraved Appetite is usual in the Green-sickness, and in Women with Child, and sometimes, but rarely, Men are troubled with it: It most frequently happens before the Flux of the Courses, or when they are suppressed. In the Green-sickness they crave for Meats that are improper and unusual, or they eat Chalk, Ashes, Coals, Pitch, Dirt, Leather, and many other things. Appetite increased, is to be cured with such things as temperate the acid Juice, as Coral, Pearls, Crabs-eyes, [Page 189](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/202:5.6?vid=65404) Filings of Steel, and the like; also Fat and Oily things, and Volatile Spirits. Take of Coral prepared, and Pearls prepared, each one scruple; of white Chalk half a scruple, of white Sugar three drams; make a Powder to be divided into six Doses. Take two Papers in a day, three or four hours after eating, in a Spoonful of strong Wine. If a Liquid Medicine be more pleasing, let him take a Spoonful of the following Mixture now and then. Take of the Waters of Mint two ounces, and of Scurvy-grass-water, and of the Tincture of Cinnamon made by Infusion in rectified Spirit of Wine, each half an ounce; of Syrup of Wormwood one ounce; mingle them. Or, Take of Oyl of Mace by Distillation, and of the Oyl of Juniper-berries, each one scruple; mingle them in a Glass: Let the Sick take two or three drops of this Oyl in a Spoonful of Malago Sack, or in any other generous Wine, or in the foregoing mixture, and let him eat fat Broths. Appetite diminished or abolished must be cured by Medicines that evacuate, and correct Flegmatick and Viscid Humours: Acids and Spices correct them, Coloquintida, Turbith, Hermodactiles, evacuate them. Take of Mint-water two ounces, of Cinnamon-water half an ounce, of Syrup of Fennel one ounce, of Spirit of Salt a sufficient quantity to make it pleasantly Acid. Or, Take of Tartar vitriolated half a dram, of Cream of Tartar one dram; of white Sugar-candy two drams; mingle them; make a Powder to be divided into three Doses. Let him take one or two in a day in Rhenish-wine, or in the preceding mixture; and if he please, instead of Spirit of Salt, he may add half a dram of Elixir proprietatis to be taken by Spoonfuls [Page 190](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/203:5.6?vid=65404)They that dislike Acids, may take the following mixture by Spoonfuls. Take of the Waters of Mint, and of Fennel, each one ounce and an half; of Aqua vitae Matthioli six drams, of Oyl of Mace by Distillation three drops, of Syrup of Mint one ounce. They that had rather take a medicated Wine, may use the following. Take of the Roots of Elecampane, and of Acorus, each two drams; of the leaves of Sage, Marjoram, Garden-rue, each one handful; of the Seeds of sweet Fennel two drams, of Orange-peel dried one dram; being cut, and grossly bruised, put them into a Bag, and hang it in a Glass, and pour on it twenty ounces of Whitewine; after it has stood a night in a Cellar, three, four or five ounces may be taken in a Morning Fasting, or at Dinner or Supper, as every one pleases, or as they find it agrees best with them. And fresh Wine may be put on as long as the Aromatick Vertue remains in the Ingredients. When Purging is necessary, Take of the greater Faetid Pills half a dram, of Coche one scruple, Extractum Catholicon ten grains, Oyl of Cloves two drops; mix them, make fifteen Pills, gild them, or cover them with Powder of Liquorish or Cinnamon. Let the Sick take five of these Pills, or more, if he be hard, to Purge. But if you design to add Chymical Medicines in form of Pills, you may prescribe in the following manner: Take of Gum-ammoniacum, or Opoponax, or the like, cleansed by Vinegar, and afterwards thickned, half a dram; of the Troches Alhandal, Mercurius dulcis, each one scruple; mix them, make fifteen Pills, and gild them: Let the Sick, take five or more of them. [Page 191](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/204:5.6?vid=65404)But if the form of an Apozem seem more convenient for the Sick, he having no great Aversion to bitter things, the following is convenient. Take of Liquorish rasped half an ounce, of the Roots of Smalage one ounce, of the Shavings of Guajacum three ounces, of Laurel-berries, and Seeds of Annise, each two drams; of the Pulp of Coloquintida half a dram; boil them in a sufficient quantity of Rain-water, in thirty ounces of the strained Decoction, dissolve of Syrup of Roses solutive, with Senna of Diacnicum, each one ounce and an half; of the Salt of Tartar vitriolated two Scruples Tincture of Cinnamon one ounce; mix them. Let the Sick take three, four or five ounces of this Decoction once or twice a day, by which the Flegmatick and viscid Humours, are both corrected and evacuated per Epicrasin. In the mean time let the Sick abstain from fat and viscid Meats: Let him use a clear Air that is hot and dry: Let Sleeping be diminished if it be too long: Let the Mind be chearful: Let the Motion and Exercise of the Body be moderate. Evacuation by Stool and Urine, daily ought to be proportionable to what is taken in by the Mouth, if it can be conveniently. Appetite diminished by fat Choler is presently cured by correcting of it, if it abound too much it must be evacuated either by Stool or Vomit, For correcting of this Choler, there is nothing more effectual than Elixir Proprietatis given in Wine, or any other convenient Mixture, five or six drops at a time, especially before Eating. Those who do not love Acids, may take in place of it sweet Spirit of Salt, prepared with rectified Spirit of Wine by several Cohobations. The same Choler is corrected by Wormwood, and Wormwood-wine; in the place of which also, other Aromatick Plants may be likewise infused in Wine, which may be drank in a small Quantity at Dinner and Supper. Such Plants are Mountain-calamint, Marjoram, Rosemary, Garden-rue, Hyssop, Thym, Sage, and the like. [Page 192](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/205:5.6?vid=65404)Choler is very conveniently evacuated by Vomit, by several Medicines prepared of Antimony, as Crocus Metallorum, Glass of Antimony, and the Sapa made of it, Oxysarcharum, or Mercurius Vitae, or the like. the like, evacuate Choler by Stool. Scammony may be prepared presently and well, if a convenient Dose of it, twelve or fifteen Grains, more or less, according to the Age and Constitution of the Sick, be powdered in a Mortar, and a little Baulm-water, Succory-water, or the like, be poured upon it, and rubbed with it till it becomes of a milky Colour; pour it off and put more Water on, that all the Vertue of the Scammony may be extracted leaving the black Faeces at the Bottom; then add to the Liquor of Cinnamon-water, or Fennel-water, or some other Aromatick-water, two drams; of Syrup of Roses solutive, or the like, two or three drams; and so you will have a very pleasant Purging Draught; and that it may work the easier, a Scruple or half a dram of Cream of Tartar may be drank in Broth half an Hour after taking the Purging Draught. Pleasant Tablets may be also made of Scammony in the following manner. Take of Christals of Tartar one ounce and an half, of Diagridium three drams, of Oyl of Cinnamon six drops, of white Sugar dissolved in Rose-water eight ounces; mingle them, make Tablets. These Tablets may be conveniently prescribed for Infants, Children, and delicate People; the highest Dose of them is from three drams to half an ounce; an Infant must take but half a dram, or a dram, a Youth may take two drams. They who are afraid to use Scammony or Medicines made of Scammony, though it be a kind, safe, and powerful Medicine, may use Rhubarb in the following manner. Take of choice Rhubarb rasped two drams, of the best crude Tartar half a dram, of Succory-water a sufficient quantity; [Page 193](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/206:5.6?vid=65404) infuse them all Night over ashes or in a Bath, to the Liquor strained, gently add of Syrup of Roses solutive, or of Succory with Rhubarb, half an ounce, of Cinnamon water two drams, and to take off the nauseous Smell of the Rhubarb, and to expel Wind, add of Oyl of Annise-seeds two or three drops; make a Draught. To evacuate the over abounding Choler, those that had rather use an Electuary may take of the following. Take of the Pulp of sharp and sweetish Prunes ten ounces, of Cream of Tartar, and the best Scammony, each two ounces; of choice Rhubarb ten drams, of sharp Cinnamon half an ounce, of Yellow Sanders two drams, of clarified Sugar a Pound; mingle them, make an Electuary. The Dose is from three drams to half an ounce; It may also be dissolved in some convenient Water, and so you may make a Potion of it. The Cure of a depraved Appetite, depends on the Purification of the Blood and Humours: But Volatile Salts are more successful in this case than any other Medicines, a few grains of them being taken twice or thrice in a day in Wine or some other Liquor, especially at Dinner or Supper; and to evacuate the vicious Humours, Purging and Vomiting must be used. CHAP. LXIV. Of Nauseousness, Belching, and Vomiting. IN perfect Health nothing is wont to be evacuated upwards by the Mouth, wherefore whatever comes this way signifies Sickness, whether it be Meat, Wind, or a thick or thin Liquor. When Wind comes forth with a Noise it is called Belching, when the Meat is ejected it is called Vomiting. Nauseousness always precedes Vomiting, and sometimes Belching. [Page 194](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/207:5.6?vid=65404)Wind by reason of the Clamminess of its Nature, sticks to the Stomach, and is difficultly excluded, and is often accompanied with an Inflation of the Stomach. Belching arises from windy Meats, or from other flatulent things taken inwardly, as Chesnuts, Pease, Beans, Turneps, Redishes, and the like, or from Flegmatick and viscid Humours sticking to the Stomach, and rarified to Wind by taking Aromaticks. That the material cause of Wind, is a Flegmatick and clammy Humour, is evident from the Antecedent Causes; as from Meats of a like kind, viz. Milk, Fish, especially Sea-Fish, and the Feet of Animals, and Gellies; and from the Cure, which is wholly performed by evacuating and correcting Flegmatick Humours. As in Belching, only Wind is evacuated, so in Vomiting, either Meat crude, or more or less fermented, or various sorts of Humours, as Watery, serous flegmatick, and cholerick, and the like; thin, thick, white, yellow, green, Sky coloured, or black Humours, or the like, insipid, bitter, acid, rough, sweet, stinking, or Humours without Taste, and sometimes bloody Matter, or Excrements. All Vomiting is occasioned by the Stomach being Primarily or Secondarily affected. The Stomach is Primarily affected, when the Cause of Vomiting, or of the Peristaltick Motion inverted is in it self. It is Secondarily affected by consent from other Parts; and it is provoked to the Inversion of its Peristaltick Motion, in Part or altogether by the Peristaltick Motion of the Guts, which is sometimes occasioned by the violent Agitation of the Diaphragma, and of the Muscles of the Belly by a violent Cough. The Stomach is primarily disposed to vomit, first when it is inflamed, excoriated, or ulcerated; then it is easily excited to any violent Contraction of it self from any sort of Nourishment taken. Secondly, When the Nourishment by its Quantity, and chiefly by its Quality, is troublesome to the Stomach. Thirdly, when sharp Humours from he Head fall upon the Somach, and corrode the lower Orifice, and so occasion Vomiting. From the total Inversion of the Peristaltick Motion of the Guts, Vomiting is occasioned, as in the Iliack Passion, whereby Glisters are often vomited up. [Page 195](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/208:5.6?vid=65404)From the same Motion inverted in Part, Vomiting is occasioned frequently, as in the Cholera Morbus, and from any other Motion upwards of Humours fermenting in the small Guts, and by Reason of the Passage of the Excrements stopped. In a violent Cough the Diaphragm being shaken violently, Vomiting is occasioned; which we think to be caused by a conjunct Compression of all the Bowels contained in the Abdomen made towards the Breast, which mightily troubles the Stomach, and forces it to the Inversion of the natural Motion. Vomiting oecasioned by things taken in at the Mouth, is quieted of its own accord, so soon as they are vomited up, or upon use of a few Aromaticks, and Opiats, it is stopped and cured. For Instance, Take of Mint-water two ounces, Tincture of Cinnamon two drams, London Landanum two grains, Syrup of Min half an ounce, mingle them, let the Sick take a spoonful of this Mixture by short Intervals, and the Vomiting will presently cease. Sharp Humours flowing from the Head upon the Stomach, are to be evacuated by proper Purges mentioned before, or corrected by Medicines, that alter and temperate the Noxious Acrimony. Vomiting of Blood occasioned by the Rupture or Erosion of the Vessels of the Stomach and Intestins, is cured by conglutinating them by the following Mixture, which is also useful in other Excresions of the Blood. Take of Plantain-water two ounces, of Cinnamon two drams, distilled Vinegar half an ounce, of red Coral prepared half a dram, of Dragons-blood ten grains, of London Laudanum two grains, of Syrup of Mirtles one ounce; mingle them. A Spoonful of this Mixture being taken often cures most Ruptures of the Vessels, and will top Fluxes of Blood in a short time beyond Expectation. But Blood collected in the Stomach, the Flux, and the Vomiting of it being stopt, will be carried off of its own Accord [Page 196](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/209:5.6?vid=65404) by Stool; but if there is danger of the Blood's coagulating, to the foregoing Mixture may be added half a dram of Crabs-eyes, and one scruple of Diaphoretick Antimony. Vomiting of Matter chiefly following an Inflammation of the Pancreas, or of some neighbouring Part, or some notable Ulcer, must be cured by curing the Primary Distemper. In the mean time you may use the above described Mixture, with Crabs-eyes and Antimonium Diaphoreticum. It will be also proper to give a drop of Balsam of Sulphur annisated in all the Liquor he takes. The belching and generation of Wind will be cured by, First, avoiding Flegmatick and Windy Meats: Secondly, By inciding and evacuating clammy Flegm: Thirdly, By attemperating the Choler if it be acrid: Fourthly, By discussing the Wind that is already made. Acids and Aromaticks, and volatile Salts, incide clammy Flegm, and Flegmagoges purge it off. Spirit of Nitre attemperates Choler when it is acrid better than any thing else; two or three drops of it being taken in common Beer, or in some convenient Mixture. Most Spices discuss Wind, so do the Oyls of them, but especially the Seeds, Flowers, and Barks; but Spirit of Niter is better than all, for it corrects Choler and Flegm, and hinders the Generation of Wind, and discusses that which is generated. The following Mixture is also good to expel Wind from the Stomach and Bowels. Take of the Waters of Mint, and Fennel, each two ounces; of Spirit of Wine rectified one ounce, of the sweet Spirit of Niter twenty drops, of London Laudanum three grains, of Oyl of Mace by Distillation six drops, of Syrup of Mint one ounce and an half; mingle them. This Mixture must be taken by Spoonfuls, often or seldom according to the degree of Pain, and Quantity of Wind. Silvius's Carminative Spirit is made in the following manner. Take of the Roots of Angelica one dram, of Master-wort, [Page 197](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/210:5.6?vid=65404) and Galingal, each one dram and an half; of the Flowers of Rosemary, and Marjoram, Garden-rue, and of the Herb called Basilicon, and of the Tops of the lesser Centaury, each half a handful; of Bay-berries three drams, of the Seeds of Angelica, Lovage, and Annise, each half an ounce; of Ginger, Nutmegs, and Mace, each one dram and an half; of Cinnamon six drams, of Cloves, and the Bark of Oranges, each one dram; cut them and powder them grosly, and pour upon them twenty quarts of Maligo Wine; digest them two days in a Bath, then distil them till they are dry, pour all again upon the Ingredients, and distil off three Fourths. CHAP. LXV. Of the Hickops THe Hickops are a Convulsive Motion of the Stomach. The Matter occasioning the Hickops is either collected in the Stomach, or communicated to it from the Liver, Spleen, Bowels, or other Parts, or from the whole Body; so sharp Meats or Medicines, sharp Humours or Worms contained in the Stomach, may occasion an Idiophathick Hickop: But a Sympathick is occasioned by Inflammations of the neighbouring Parts, or from Humours, or sharp Vapours transferred to the Stomach from Diseases of the whole Body, as in acute and malignant Feavers. The Signs of the Causes must be thus distinguished: If it be Idiopathick it is more continual, and Signs of Humours contained, in the Stomach appear, and then it is cured by Vomiting. The Peccant Humour collected in the Stomach, may be known by Vomiting, Belching, a Taste in the Mouth, and other Signs, If it proceed from a Disease of any other Part, the Signs of it must be sought for in the proper Chapters. As to the Prognostick, that Hickop from any Procatarctick cause, as from Meat, Drink, or Cold, is not dangerous; [Page 198](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/211:5.6?vid=65404) and also that which precedes a critical Vomiting If it happen in a Feaver, it shews that the Disease is very dangerous: A Hickop coming after Vomiting is also dangerous. The Cure of this Disease is to be directed to the Causes of it, which as is said before, produce this Disease Sympathically, or Idiopathically; the Causes that occasion a Sympathick Hickop, are the Diseases of other Parts, which being cured, the Hickop is also taken off, though those Remedies which are proper to remove the Symptom may be used in the mean while. An Idiopathick Hickop is occasioned by Flegm, Wind, Choler, or any other acrid or malignant Humour. That which is occasioned by a Flegmatick Humour must be cured by Remedies that incide, purge, and cleanse that Humour, and that strengthen the Stomach; to which may be added the following Medicines, which are peculiarly proper for the Symptom. Take of Tincture of Castor one dram, of the Juice of Mint four ounces. Let the Sick take a spoonful or two at a time, and let his Stomach be anointed with it hot twice or thrice a day. Vinegar of Squills may be taken frequently to incide and dissolve the Matter impacted into the Tunicks of the Stomach; or instead of it Oxymel of Squills; Cloves also held frequently in the Mouth do good; also Elixir Proprietatis described by Crollius is good. Take of the Seeds of Dill two or three drams; boil them gently in eight ounces of good Wine: Let the Sick tak two Spoonfuls Morning and Evening. The Seed also tied up in a Rag may be held to the Nostrils frequently; when the Disease is obstinate the following Pills are very effectual. Take of Castor, and Mirrh, each three drams; of Sal-gemma half an ounce, of Diagridium, and Mastich, each one dram; of the fresh Troches of Agarick three drams, of choice Aloes the Weight of all; mix them with the Juice [Page 199](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/212:5.6?vid=65404) of Mint, and make a Mass. Of each dram make six Pills, gild them, let the Sick take two or three in a Morning, two hours before Meat, twice a Week. Pills also made of the Powder of Hiera, with Oxymel, are also good, whereof a dram may be taken at a time. Of the days the Sick does not Purge, let him take the following Powder. Take of the Seeds of Dill half an ounce, of Zedoary, and of Woo Aloes, of Nutmegs, Cloves, and of the Powder of Dmbra, each one dram; mix them, let him take two scruples with a little good Wine, or adding three ounces of common Salt, let him use of it with his Meat. Let the following Cataplasm be applied to his Stomach. Take of the Roots of long Birth-wort, of Florentine-orris, of Bayberries, of the Leaves of Rue, and dried Mint, each three drams; of Castor, and Mirrh, each two drams; of Cloves, and Hyposistis, each six drams; with Honey of Rosemary-flowers; make a Cataplasm. Lastly, when the Disease is very obstinate, we must use a Decoction of Guajacum, and the Bath-water. That which prooceeds from Wind, must be cured by Remedies that are proper to expel Wind: Let Cupping-glasses be applied to the Region of the Stomach, which, like a Miracle, mitigate and take off suddenly flatulent Diseases of the Lower-belly. That which proceeds from an acrid and cholerick Humour, must be cured by Bleeding if there be a Plethora, and by Vomiting, or by Purging every third day. Take of choice Rhubarb powdered, and moistened with Endive-water, half an ounce, of the Pulp of Tamarinds two drams, of the Seeds of Endive, Purslain, and Spodium, each one dram; of Yellow Sanders, and of Diagridium, each half a dram; with Syrup of Lemons, make a Mass for Pills; of half a dram, make four or five Pills to be taken in the Morning. [Page 200](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/213:5.6?vid=65404)Of other Days let him take the Conserve of Roses and Borrage, mixed with a little of the Powder of the three Sanders. Emulsions of the cold Seeds attemperate powerfully the Acrimony of the Humours; Syrup of Apples mixed with Syrup of Quinces is also good; hot or cold Water, or a Ptisan is also to be drank freely of. Foment the Stomach with a Spunge dipt in Rose-vinegar, and apply the following Plaister to the Back and Stomach. Take of the Ceratum Santalinum, and of Ointment of Roses, each one ounce; of Mastich half an ounce, of the Bark of Citron, and of the Flesh of Quinces, each one dram; with the Juice of Housleek; and with a little Turpentine, make Plaisters. If there be a Suspicion of a malignant Quality, Treacle or some other Alexipharmick must be prescribed; and the Region of the Stomach must be anointed with the Oyl of Scorpions. But from whatsoever Cause the Hickops arise, the following Medicines are to be used. First, The Peccant Humour must be evacuated by Vomit, if the Sick can bear it, and it must be repeated, if the Disease be lessened by it, but not quite taken away: and strong Vomits must be given, if the Case so require, as Platerus teaches in his Practice, whereof he mentions an Observation in these Words. A Surgeon was seized with the Hickops, and they were so continual Night and Day, that he cou'd not sleep, nor scarce speak or eat, being extreamly weakned by them, he earnestly desired we should give him a strong Chimical Vomit, which being taken, he cast up a vast Quantity of green and black Choler, the Vomiting stopt, and he recovered. But if the Sick cannot take a Vomit, he must be purged by stool, but the Humour must be first prepared by things that incide and cleanse: Afterwards these things that follow are convenient. Cupping-glasses must be applied opposite to the Region of the Stomach, and to the Stomach. The Stomach must be bound with a Swath-band, that [Page 201](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/214:5.6?vid=65404) it may not be so much dilated. Ligatures of the Extremities must be used. Let him eat Anniseeds, which is thought to Cure the Hickops peculiarly. Frequently Glisters must be injected, to draw away the Noxious Humours from the Stomach. Young Animals must be applied to the Stomach. Vinegar of Squills may be taken by Spoonfuls. Sneezing casts off the Matter impacted in the Coats of the Stomach. As the Physician Chrysimacus cured Aristophanes of a Hickop by provoking Sneezing, when he could not do it by stopping of the Spirits, and Gargling with cold Water. Pills made of one dram of Aloes, and three grains of London Laudanum are good. Platerus in his Observations says, That he cured a Boy of ten Years of Age, that had the Hickops for eight Days and Nights continually, with the Water of green Nuts distilled, with Radishes infused, first in Vinegar, which he gave him to provoke Vomiting; and though he did not Vomit at all, yet he was cured. But to conclude, Narcoticks wiil do the Business when nothing else will. CHAP. LXVI. Of Vomiting of Blood. THe conjunct cause, is the Quantity or Quality of the Blood exceeding. The external causes, are Wounds and Bruises, and violent Heat, or immoderate Cold, or unaccustomed Labour and Excercise, or Hollowing. If the Blood flow from the Stomach, there will be almost always a continual Pain and Weight there, and the quantity of it will not be much, because the Veins of the Stomach are small, and Nauseousness will accompany it, and Blood will be mixed sometimes with Meat, sometimes with Choler, and sometimes with Flegm. [Page 202](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/215:5.6?vid=65404)If it flow from the Head, there will be a Tickling perceived about the Jaws and Pallate, and Blood will flow sometimes from the Nostrils mixed with Snot, and a Pain or Heaviness of the Head precedes. If Vomiting of Blood proceeds from a Suppression of the Courses, it will be Periodical. As to the Prognostick, Vomiting of Blood from what Cause soever it arises, is dangerous; for if too great a quantity be evacuated, there is Danger of Death; if it coagulate in the Stomach, and corrupt there, it occasions Fainting. But a Vomiting of Blood from Suppression of Courses is least dangerous. They which fall into a Dropsie by Vomiting of Blood die. It must be cured by Medicines that cause a Revulsion of the Blood from the Stomach, and by such as attemperate it, and stop the Apertion of the Veins. And First, Because an orderly Diet is of great use in this Case, the common Diet ought to be astringent and Emplastick, and also cooling, as Barley Broths, Almond and Rice Diet, Water-gruel, and Jellies, and especially Starch boiled in Milk, whereunto may be added Pomegranate Juice, or a little Rose-vinegar; hard Eggs may be also used dipt in Vinegar. Also Bread dipt in Water; Chicken Broth, with Wood-sorrel, Purslain, and Plantane boiled in it; but at the beginning of eating, some Astringent thing should be taken, as a Quince baked under Ashes, Medlars, or the like. Let the Sick abstain from all acrid, salt, peppered, and fried Meats, and also from such things as yield a great deal of Nourishment, unless the Weakness of the Sick requires that they should be taken sparingly. He must drink but little, and when he does, he must drink Water wherein Iron has been quenched, with a little Juice of Pomegranates in it. The Air must be somewhat Cold, but he must not expose himself to the Winds, nor to the Rays of the Sun or Moon: He must sleep moderately, and his Body must be kept open, and his Mind free from Passion. Bleeding must be used sparingly, and it must be repeated; Frictions and Ligatures must be used, and cleansing [Page 203](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/216:5.6?vid=65404) Glisters must be injected. Apply Cupping-glasses to the Legs, Loins, and Hypochondres. Let two Spoonfuls of Oxycrat be given, if there be a Suspicion of coagulated Blood; for by the use of it, it may be easily dissolved, and driven from the Veins of the Stomach, and they will be stopt thereby; foment the Region of the Stomach also with it cold; and if the Sick does not Vomit, the following Mixture may be used to stop the Veins, Take the White of one Egg, of Rose-water, and Vinegar, each one dram and an half; shake them well, and add to them two drams of Starch; mix them, and let the Sick take it by Spoonfuls. Or, Take of prepared Coral, sealed Earth, Bole-armonick, Blood-stone, Troches of Ambar, each one dram; of Plantane-water, and Syrup of Mirtles, each two ounces; mingle them, let the Sick take it as before. Or, Let the Sick take Morning and Evening, four ounces of the Juice of Plantane cold. Galen says, That nothing is better than this Juice to stop any Flux of Blood. The Juice of Purslain and Knot-grass is also good for the same Purpose. Take of the Waters of Plantane, and Purslain, each one ounce and an half; of Syrup of Mirtles half an ounce, of Syrup of Poppies one ounce; mingle them, make a Julep to be repeated often. Take of old conserve of Roses, and of Comfrey-roots, each one ounce; of Marmalad of Quinces half an ounce, one Mirobalan candied, Troches of Ambar, and of Lemnian Earth, each two drams; of Coral prepared, and of Saffron of Mars, each one dram; with Syrup of dried Roses; make an Opiat to be used frequently. Troches of Ambar do not only bind, but also dissolve concreted Blood, and therefore are frequently to be used: Tincture of Coral, made with Juice of Lemons, is also very good. [Page 204](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/217:5.6?vid=65404)But when the Blood is evacuated violently, and cannot be stopt by the forementioned Medicines, Narcoticks must be taken inwardly, and injected by Glisters, and the Region of the Stomach must be anointed with Oyl of Roses and of Mirtles washed in Vinegar, and after you have anointed it, sprinkle on Powder of Coral, Bolearmonick, and sealed Earth; or anoint the Stomach with the following Ointment. Take of the Juices of Plantane, and Knot-grass, each one ounce and an half; Rose-vinegar one ounce, of Omphacin Oyl six ounces; boil them to the Consumption of the Juices, then add of Dragons-blood, Mastich, Pomegranate peels, and Mirtles, each two drams; of Camphor one scruple, with a sufficient quantity of red Wax, make an Ointment. Let him drink Water wherein hot Iron hath been quenched, with Syrup of Quinces and Spirit of Vitriol in it, and let his Broths be made of the same Water. Let his Loins and Hypochondres be fomented with a Decoction made of Plantane and Purslain in Oxycrat; and let it be used when it is almost cold; and let him put his Hands into cold Water; Afterwards let the foresaid Parts be anointed with Galen's cooling Ointment washed in Vinegar. Bleeding being sufficiently used, gentle and frequent Purging must be ordered, whereby the Blood may be cleared from Serous and Cholerick Humours occasioning this Disease: But they ought to be made of Rhubarb, Myrobalans, Tamarinds, and the like, which Bind as well as Purge, and do not stir the Humours; they may be given in the form of a Bolus with Syrup of Mirtles, or dried Roses, or in a Potion made of a Decoction of Sorrel, Succory, Purslain, and the like. When Purging is used, which ought to be continued for three or four days, at Bed-time, after every Purge, the forementioned Opiate, Syrup of Coral, or some other astringent and Corroberating Medicine must be used. Lastly, For Precaution, a dram of Rhubarb powdered must be given once a week for a long time. [Page 205](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/218:5.6?vid=65404) CHAP. LXVII. Of the Cholera Morbus, i. e. Vomiting and Loosness. THis Disease was most Epidemical in the Year 1669, says Doctor Sydenham, than ever he knew it in any other Year; it comes as certainly at the latter end of Summer, as Swallows at the beginning of Spring, and as Cuckows at the Heat of the following Season. That Disease which is occasioned by a Surfeit comes at any time, the Symptoms are indeed alike, and the Cure the same, yet it is of another kind. The Disease is easily known, for there are violent Vomitings, and an Evacuation of ill Humours, with great Difficulty and Trouble by Stool; there is a violent Pain and Inflation of the Belly and Guts, an Heart-burning, Drouth, and quick-pulse, with Heat and Anxiety, with great Nauseousness, and sometimes a Colliquative Sweat, Contractions of the Arms and Legs, Fainting, a Coldness of the extream Parts, and such-like Symptoms, which greatly terrifie the By-standers, and kill the Patient in twenty four Hours. There is also a dry Cholera from a flatuous Spirit breaking out above and below without Vomiting and Loosness. I have found, by diligent Application of Mind, and by manifold Eperience, that if on the one hand I should endeavour to expel the sharp Humours, that are the Fewel of the Disease, by Catharticks, I should do just as he that endeavours to quench Fire with Oyl, seeing the Operation of the most gentle Cathartick wou'd but give farther Disturbance, and raise new Tumults: And on the other Hand, should I at the first restrain the primary Effort with Narcotick Medicines, and other Astringents, whilst I hindred natural Evacuation, and detained the Humour against Nature, the Patient would be undoubtedly destroyed by an intestine War, his Enemy being inclosed in his Bowels: For these Reasons therefore, I thought I must go the middle Way, that I might partly evacuate, and partly dilute the Humour. I ound out [Page 206](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/219:5.6?vid=65404) this Method several Years ago, and have long experienced it, and have by it many Times reduced this Disease to good Order. A Young Chicken is boiled in about three Gallons of Spring-water, so that the Liquor hath scarce any Relish of the Chick. The Patient is ordered to drink several large Draughts of this a little warm; at the same time a good quantity will serve for several Glisters, to be given successively, until all the Broths be consumed, and rendred upwards and downwards; an ounce of the Syrups of Lettice, Violets, Purslain, Water-lilly, may be now and then mixt with the Draughts and Glisters; though the Broth may do very well without any such Addition. So the Stomach being loaded with a considerable quantity of the Liquor, and as I may say turned, and the Injection of Glisters being reiterated, the sharp Humours are either cast out, or their Acrimony being taken off, they are reduced to a due Temper, the Filth being cast up by these means, which require three or fours Hours: Some Paragorick Medicine perfects the Cure; I use this often. Take of Couslip-water one ounce, of Aqua-mirabilis one dram, Liquid Laudanum fourteen drops. Instead of which any Shop-Narcotick may be made use of, and this way of diluting the Humours is much safer, and more expedite, than that which is most commonly taken to stop this most dangerous Disease; viz. either by Evacuaters or Astringents; because the Tumult is heightned by Evacuaters, and all things are put in a Hurly-burly by them; and the other, on the contrary, detain an Enemy in the Bowels, and of a Stranger do plainly make him an Inhabitant: To say nothing of the tedious Trouble created to the Patient, when the Disease is protracted, whereby at length the Bad Humours creep into the Mass of Blood, and easily kindle a malignant Fever. But it is to be diligently noted, That if the Phisician be not called till the Voming and Loosness have continued many Hours, suppose ten or twelve, and the Patient is worn out, so that the extream Parts wax cold; I say in this case, all other Remedies being omitted, he must immediately fly to Laudanum, the sacred Anchor in this Disease, [Page 207](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/220:5.6?vid=65404) which is not only to be given when the Symptoms are urgent, but also after the Vomiting and Loosness go off, and to be repeated Morning and Evening daily, till the Patient has recovered his Strength and Health. Though this Disease be Epidemical, yet it very seldom lasts longer than August, in which it first began; on which Account I have been induced to contemplate that most subtile and elegant Artifice, which Nature uses in the Production of Epidemick Diseases; for though the same Causes wholly remain, so that many should be seised with this Disease as well in September as August, by reason of eating too much Fruit, yet we see the same Effect does not follow: And he that has carefully collected the Phaenomena of a legitimate Cholera, of which only we treat at present, will confess, that that Disease which invades at any other time of the Year, though coming upon the same occasion, and accompanied with some of the same Symptoms, is quite different from this now spoken of; just as if there were some secret and peculiar thing in the Air of this peculiar Month, able to impress on the Blood, or on the Ferment of the Stomach, some such specifick Alteration adapted only to this Disease. CHAP. LXVIII. Of a Pain in the Stomach. A Pain of the Stomach proceeds from something that distends and gnaws it, and so causes a Solution of the Continuum. But in the Stomach three very different Parts are to be considered, viz. The upper and lower Orifice, and the Body of it which makes its Cavity. The upper Orifice is indued with an exquisite Sense, because a great Nerve is placed there proceeding from the sixth Conjugation, and therefore the Pains in it are very sharp, and the Heart, by reason of its nearness is also affected; and therefore this Pain is called Cardialgia, and Cardiogmos; and so great is the Agreement of the [Page 208](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/221:5.6?vid=65404) Heart with the upper Orifice of the Stomach, that the Ancients called this Orifice in non-Latin alphabet But if the Membranes, constituting the Cavity of the Stomach, or if the lower Orifice be affected, it is called a Pain of the Stomach, or the Cholick of the Stomach, especially when it is occasioned by Wind. The next cause of this Pain, is a Solution of the Continuum occasioned by things that bite and distend; and those things that chiefly and most frequently bite and distend the Stomach, are Humours, or Wind, whereunto may be added Worms velicating the Tunicks of the Stomach. Acrid and Malignant Humours, as green or Black Choler, salt Flegm, corrupt Ichor, Stinking Matter coming from an Abscess of the Liver or Breast broken, and poured upon the Stomach, and all other Acrimonious Humours, may occasion a Pain of the Stomach. Also acid Vapours arising from the said Humours may occasion the same Pain: Wind also contained in the Cavity of the Stomach may occasion Inflation, and a painful Tension, but especially when it is contained within the Tunicks of the Stomach, which makes the Disease obstinate, because it can be hardly discussed. Diseases also of the Stomach, and of the neighbouring Parts are wont to occasion this Pain, as a hot or cold Intemperies, Inflammation, Schirrhus, or any other hard Tumour occasioning a heavy Pain: And lastly, Wounds and Ulcers of the Part, and Tumours and Inflations of the Neighbouring Parts, by pressing the Stomach may occasion Pain. But Humours and Wind that occasion the Pain of the Stomach, are either generated in the Stomach, or flow from the whole Body, or some Parts of it; from the whole Body in Feavers, or when the Body is full of ill Humours; from other Parts, but especially from the Liver, Spleen, and Brain; from the Liver flows Choler, from the Spleen Melancholly and black Choler, from the Head salt Flegm. Also from other extraordinary and rare Causes, such a Pain may arise, as from Stones generated in the Stomach, and the like. Fabritius Hildanus relates, that a Matron having swallowed a piece of the Rine of Bacon, kept it in her [Page 209](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/222:5.6?vid=65404) Stomach two Years, and was afflicted with continual Pain, and at length by taking a Vomit, she cast it up and was cured. External causes occasioning this Disease, are either Meats infected with an ill Quality, or indued with a great deal of Acrimony, which are sufficient of themselves to occasion such a Pain, or they are apt to generate Winds; or taken in too great a quantity, they putrifie and become Acrimonious, or they are too hot: Or strong and acrid Medicines, or such as are indued with a destructive Faculty may occasion the Pain; or when they are taken in too great a quantity, or not being well corrected, and Poisons may also occasion the same Pain. The Diagnostick Signs are to be directed to the Part affected and to the cause, and first the Situation of the Pain shews that the upper Orifice of the Stomach is affected, when it is perceived under the Xiphoid Cartilage, but the violence of the Pain occasioned by the exquisite sense of the Part shews more certainly that this Part is affected, and that it is a true Cardialgia, so do the Anxiety and Restlesness, so that the Sick cannot abide in one Posture, there is also Fainting and Swooning by Reason of the Consent of the Heart, wherewith there is a great Sympathy, not only by Reason of the Nearness, but because there is a great Loss of Spirits by the violence of the Pain; sometimes also the Brain is affected by Sympathy, by reason of the great Nerve that is implanted in this Part, and because acrid Vapours are elevated to the Head from the Stomach, upon which account Head-achs, Giddiness, and the Falling-Sickness arise sometimes. In other Parts of the Stomach there are also sharp Pains, but they are not accompanied with so grievous Symptoms, and they resemble Chollick Pains, but they differ in Situation. The causes occasioning these Pains are distinguished by their proper Signs, whereof the most plain are known by things evacuated; for if Flegm, or Choler, or Wind, or Worms, are ejected by Vomit or Stool, it is easie to conjecture that the Disease proceeds from such Causes; but though there be no Evacuation of the Morbifick Matter, we may know by peculiar Signs, when Choler, Flegm, or Wind abounds. [Page 210](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/223:5.6?vid=65404)The Signs also of Worms may be taken from the Chapter of Worms, and the peculiar Diseases of the Stomach it self, or of the Neighbouring Parts occasioning this Disease may be known by every ones proper Signs; the Humour causing the Pain may be also guessed at by the Time of the Invasion, of its Increase and Cessation; for in some the Pain is worst before eating, and this signifies that Choler prevails, which when the Sick is fasting is drawn into the Stomach, or becomes more acrid thereby; in others the Pain begins presently after eating, because the crude and biting Humours, which before lay quiet in the Tunicks of the Stomach, are disturbed by eating; or being seated in the bottom of the Stomach, they at that time are raised, and offend the upper Orifice, and in some the Pain is worst whilst the Meat is concocting, because acrid and biting Vapours are elevated from the Morbifick Matter by the Heat increased in the Stomach at the Time of Concoction; in others four or five Hours after eating, because the Meat is corrupted by the Concoction being depraved, by which means it velicates the Stomach; in others the Pain is augmented after Sleep, and this is occasioned by a Catarrh, the Humour flowing from the Brain in the Sleep, which being heaped up in a great quantity occasions Pain when the Sick awakes; but the Pain is sometimes quieted by eating, the Acrimony of the Humours being asswaged by the Benignity of the Food. As to the Prognostick, it is certain that a Cardialgia is much more dangerous than other Pains of the Stomach, by reason of the exquisite sense of the Mouth of the Stomach, and the great Sympathy that is betwixt that and the principle parts. The greater or lesser is the Pravity of the Morbifick cause, and the violence of the Symptoms, so is the Danger more or less. A continual and acute Feaver, joined with a great Pain of the Stomach, threatens great Danger; for Hippocrates says, Aphor. 65. Section 5. A great Heat about the Stomach, and Cardiogmos in Feavers, are ill, for they signifie a great Quantity of vitious Humours contained in the Stomach. A Pain of the Stomach, occasioned by Worms or Wind is most commonly less dangerous, for that the Cause is not [Page 211](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/224:5.6?vid=65404) so obstinate, and not fixed to the Part; but yet sometimes violent Symptoms arise from Worms contained in the Stomach, and biting it, whereby the Sick is presently killed; and also when the Intemperies occasioning Wind is obstinate, as it were habitual, it is not without Danger, because it degenerates into a dry Dropsie. Hippocrates, Aphor. 7. Sect. 4. says, That Coldness in the extream parts, in a Cardialgia, portends Death. The Cure of this Disease is to be varied according to the Variety of the Causes, for if it arises from the Diseases of other Parts, the Cure of them must be taken Care of; but if the Cause be seated in the Stomach it self, the Pain proceeds either from Wind or sharp and cholerick Humours, or from an Inflammation, Abscess, or Ulcer. That which is generated by Wind, must be cured by Remedies that discuss and evacuate that flatulent Matter, and also Flegm which breeds Wind. And first, An emollient and loosning Glister must be injected, and presently after a carminative and discussing Glister made of the Decoction of the Leaves of Wild-marjoram, Calaminth, Penny-royal, Rue, and the lesser-centaury, the Seeds of Annise, Fennel, Daucus, Cummin, and the like, wherein may be dissolved Benedictum Laxativum, Oyl of Dill, Rue, and Honey of Rosemary. If the Pain continue, a Glister must be made of Oyl of Rue, or of Nuts, and of generous Wine each equal Parts, you must add to it two ounces of Aqua-vitae, or you may prepare a Glister of Whitewine mixed with eight drops of Oyl of Juniper, Cinnamon, or of Chymical Oyl of Cloves Afterwards the following Fomentation must be applyed to the Region of the Stomach. Take of the Roots of Cyperus, Galingal, sweet smelling Flag, each one ounce; of the Leaves of Mint, wild-marjoram Marjoram, Penny-royal, Hyssop and Sage, each one handful; of the Seeds of Fennel, Daucus, Caraways, Bay-berries, each half an ounce; of the Flowers of Camomil, Melilot, Rosemary, and Lavinder, each one Pugil; cut them and beat them, and put them into two Bags, boil them in generous Wine, press them out and pply them hot to the Stomach and Belly by turns. [Page 212](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/225:5.6?vid=65404)But when the Matter is not very cold, the following Fomentation may be prepared, which is much commended by Forestus, and he says, it will give Ease when other Medicines will do no good, Take of the Roots of Marshmallows half an ounce, of red Roses, the Flowers of Camomil, and of the Tops of Centaury, each one handful; boil them in Fountain and Camomil-water to a Pint and an half; at last add a little good Rhenish-wine, Rose-water, and Vinegar, make a Fomentation. After the Fomentation, anoint the parts with Oyl of Rue, and Dill mixed with Aqua-vitae, and a little of the Oyl of Sage, or of Cloves Chimically extracted; after the Anointing apply the Plaister of Laurel-berries, or instead of it a Cataplasm made of Honey and the Seeds of Cummin. In the mean time whilst these things are about, if the Stomach be nauseous, Vomiting may be provoked by some gentle Vomit, or a Purge may be given that evacuates Flegm. After the Body is purged, Oyl of bitter Almonds mixed with White-wine may be taken, or Aqua-clareta, or Cinnamon-water. The following Julep is very effectual to ease Pain, discuss Wind, to cleanse Flegm, and to strengthen the Stomach. Take of the Leaves of common Worm-wood, of the lesser Centaury, and Agrimony, each half an handful; boil them to five ounces; in the Liquor dissolve one ounce of white Sugar. Let it be taken for two days in the Morning. Amatus Lusitanus greatly commends the distilled Water of Camomil-flowers, as a special Remedy to ease Pains of the Bowels and Stomach; three ounces of it may be taken warm; or in the place of this Water, a Decoction of Camomil-flowers may be used, which is greatly commended by Forestus, who says, that he cured a certain Merchant of a violent Pain in the Stomach, with only [Page 213](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/226:5.6?vid=65404) giving this Decoction once; he had no sooner drank it than he fell into a Sweat, belching up Wind, and in a Minute all the Pains went off, so that there was no occasion for any other Remedies. A Vomit may be prepared of this Decoction, made with Seeds of Dill, or with Agarick, or the Roots of Wake-robin, wherein may be dissolved Oxymel, Syrup of Sorrel, or of Roses solutive, which may be given at the beginning of the Disease to mitigate the Pain by evacuation. Galen says, that a Cupping-glass applied to the Stomach removes the Pain wonderfully, but this Caution must be taken notice of, viz. That but little or no crude Humour be in the Stomach, for if there be, it will increase the Pain. Bread fresh drawn out of the Oven, cut in the middle, and applied to the Part, does good, either by it self or sprinkled with Aromatick Powders. But if the Disease be obstinate, you must use a Bath made of a Decoction of emollient and healing Herbs, which is safest and most effectual, for it eases the Pain by discussing the Wind, and driving it through rhe Pores of of the Skin. But the Buisness will be sooner done, if in the Bath the Sick take some discutient Remedy, for both concurring the Cure will be effectually performed. The Bath ought to be very hot, that the Wind may be the easier discussed, and that the gross Humours may be melted, If Glisters cannot be injected or retained, by reason of the violence of the Pain, a Purge must be given in the Bath, where the Sick must continue half an hour or an hour till the Purge begins to operate. But sometimes when there is danger, by reason of the violence of the Pain, Narcoticks must be given, which being prudently administred do often a great deal of good. Some mix Narcoticks with Purgers, that the Pain may be eased, and the peccant Matter evacuated at the same Time. Take of Diaphaenicon half an ounce, of Philonium Romanum two Scruples; with the Water or Decoction of Camomil make a Potion. [Page 214](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/227:5.6?vid=65404)After the Pain is taken off, Purging should be repeated once or twice a Month in such as are subject to this Disease, that the Cause of Wind may be removed; corroborating Medicines must be also used, but if the Pain arise from Choler, it must be cured by the Evacuation of the peccant Humour, as by a gentle Vomit, or a Purging Medicine; or by injecting Glisters frequently, which ought to be emollient, not sharp or hot. Afterwards the Acrimony of the Humours is to be mitigated by cooling and thickning Juleps; by Emulsions of the four greater cold seeds, by new Milk, Oyl of sweet Almonds newly drawn, by Yolks of Eggs and the like. Strenghning Medicines must be used, and Narcoticks upon occasion, and outwardly must be applied a Cataplasm of White-bread Crums boiled in Milk, Yolks of Eggs and Saffron being added. Or you may apply Bread fresh drawn and cut in the middle and moistened with Vinegar; or let the part be fomented with a Decoction of the Flowers of Camomil, Violets, and of Water-lillies; or which is much better, let the Sick be bathed with warm Water, for this is very effectual for the Cure of this Disease. If when the Pain is eased, it should chance to return again, the Sick must be purged twice a Month, and the hot Intemperies must be corrected by a cooling Diet and convenient Remedies. But when the Pain proceeds from an Inflammation, Abscess, or Ulcer, it must be cured by Remedies to be proposed in the following Chapter. [Page 215](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/228:5.6?vid=65404) CHAP. LXIX. Of an Inflammation, Abscess, and lcer of the Stomach. THough in the Stomach, as in all other Parts, all sorts of Tumours may happen, yet here we only treat of an Inflammation or Phlegmon, which is most frequent, for other Tumours rarely happen, and may be cured by the same Method, wherewith the Tumours of other inward parts are. An Inflammation of the Stomach is a preternatural Tumour arising from Blood poured upon the Substance of the Stomach, and its Membranes. And this Blood is either pure and sincere, and then it produces a Phlegmon properly so called, or it is mixed with Choler, Flegm, and Melancholly, and then it produces an Oedematous, Schirrhus, Phlegmon, or a Phlegmon mixed with an Erysipelas. There may be many external Causes, viz. Whatsoever renders the Blood hot, as hot Medicines; drinking of Wine, or whatever forces the Blood thither, as a Bruise of the Stomach, especially when it is full of Meat; to which may be added hot and acrid things taken inwardly, as Cantharides, Sublimate, and the like. The Diagnostick Signs of this Disease are, a great Burnining, Pricking Distending, Pain with Pulsation, stretching it self to the Back. The Tumour may be felt and sometimes seen; the Shoulders are drawn backward; the Breathing, Swallowing, and Belching are difficult. Sometimes something Bloody is Vomited up; there is a violent Feaver accompanied with dreadful Symptoms. If the Inflammation be purely from Blood it is somewhat gentler, but if it be joined with an Eysipelas, the Symptoms are very violent, and there is an inward Feaver, though the outward Parts are cold, and the Thirst is unquenchable: To this Inflammation of the Stomach that Inflammation is near of kin, which either seises that Part of the Liver, wherewjth the Stomach is covered, or that lies upon the Region of the Abdomen, which can be only [Page 216](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/229:5.6?vid=65404) distinguished by the violence of the Symptoms; for the Inflammation of the Stomach is the most violent and most dangerous. From what has been said, it may be easily prognosticated that this Disease is very dangerous and most commonly deadly. Nevertheless that is most dangerous which seises the upper Orifice of the Stomach, and partakes of the Nature of an Erysipelas. If the Inflammation do not kill, and be not resolved, it degenerates into an Abscess, which is known by the Remission of Heat and Feaver, the Tumour remaining. The Abscess being broken an Ulcer is left behind, which may be known by the Evacuation of Matter by Vomit and Stool. But an Ulcer of the Stomach does not only proceed from an Abscess broken, but also from other causes, which must be here mentioned, least any thing should be desicient in the Theory of it. Therefore the causes of an Ulcer of the Stomach are either Internal or External; the Internal causes are acrid Humours bred in the Stomach, or transmitted from another place to it, as Yellow and Black Choler, or salt Flegm. The external causes, are acrid and corroding Medicines or Poisons, and hither may be referred Wounds of the Stomach ill cured, which degenerate into an Ulcer; and also the Rupture of some great Vein, which cannot be well cured after vomiting much Blood up. An Ulcer bred in the Stomach, may be known chiefly by the Evacuation of Matter by Vomit and Stool, to which primary Sign others may be added: For first, There is perceived in the Stomach a pricking Pain with Heat, especially when any thing acrid, salt, acid, or any thing very hot or very cold is taken inwardly. There is moreover a Loss of Appetite, Stinking, Belching, and a small and continual Feaver. The Prognostick is most commonly deadly, unless the Ulcer be very small, and possess the Superficies, and has not a Feaver joined with it; for the Membrane of the Stomach being ulcerated is difficultly cured, and the Nourishment cannot be well concocted, and it is rejected before [Page 217](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/230:5.6?vid=65404) a due concoction; besides Medicines can do little good, for things that cleanse, which are necessary for the Cure of the Ulcer, cause Pain; and things that dry, which should satisfie the other Indication of Healing the Ulcer, are continually spoiled by the Meat and Drink, and Chyle, and other Humours which always stagnate in a weak Stomach. The Cure of the foresaid Diseases is to be instituted particularly. And first, The Cure of the Inflammation is to be begun by Bleeding repeated in the Arm as often as the Strength will bear; and though it may seem to be dejected at first by reason of the fainting and Coldness of the extream Parts, yet this Infirmity of the Strength proceeds from an Oppression which requires Evacuation, and therefore Bleeding ought not to be forbid. Moreover, the opening of the Hemorrhoid Veins, if the Sick has been accustomed to this Evacuation, may conveniently cause a Revulsion of the Blood from the Stomach. Cupping-glasses applied to the Back and Buttocks, both dry and moist, Frictions and Ligatures of the extream Parts, and the heating those that are wont to be cold, by applying hot Cloaths, and by anointing them with Oyl of Orris, Nard, and with other hot things, may be also conveniently used to draw the Blood from the Stomach. But Purging is not allowed of, because it disturbes the Humours, and draws them to the Part affected. Yet Avicen commends a Decoction of Tamarinds, or half an ounce of Cassia, dissolved in Endive-water, or in Whey, and would have it given daily till the seventh Day; yet it is better to abstain from all purging at the Beginning; but the Seventh Day being over, and some Signs of Concoction and Declination appearing, Purging may be instituted with a dram of Rhubarb, and a Scruple of red Sanders infused in Borrage-water; you must add one or two ounces of the Syrup of Roses, that the Filth sticking to the Part may be evacuated. In the mean while Lenient, cooling, and emollient Glisters must be daily injected. Take of Chicken-broth, or a Decoction of Mallows and Violets, one Pint; of Cassia fresh drawn one ounce, of Oyl of [Page 218](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/231:5.6?vid=65404) Roses and Violets, each two ounces; of Sugar one ounce and an half, Yolks of Eggs number two; make a Glister. The same altering and corroborating things may be taken inwardly, which were proposed for a Cure of the Pain of the Stomach occasioned by a Cholerick Humour. But Syrup of Water-lillies, and of the Juice of Purslain, are peculiarly proper, especially at the beginning; because they may serve instead of a repelling Medicine. Emulsions also of the four cold Seeds, and of the Seeds of white-Poppies are proper, for they are lenitive, and qualifie the Heat, and so do also the following Juleps. Take of the Waters of Roses three ounces, of Plantane two ounces, of the Juice of Sorrel one ounce and an half, of Sugar of Roses one ounce, boil them a little and strain them. Let him take two ounces twice or thrice a Day. If the Pain be very violent, Syrup of Poppies may be taken. Let him use for his Drink Barley-water sweetned with Syrup of Violets, which he must drink cold. In Progress of the Disease, Medicines are to be mixed with the foregoing, which may help the Resolution; to which end the following Julep may be prescribed. Take of the Syrups of Water-lillies, of Apples, and of the Juice of Purslain, each one ounce; of the Syrup of Roman Wormwood half an ounce, of the Waters of Sorrel, Lettice, and Fennel, each three ounces; of the Species Diamargarite frigid one dram; make a Julep for three Doses to be taken twice a day To these may be added restorative Opiats, Narcoticks and the like; all which are to be varied according to the Judgment and Discretion of the Physician. Turpentine washed in Wormwood-water taken twice or thrice, resolves and ripens Imposthumes of the Stomach. The following Fomentation may be applyed outwardly in the beginning. [Page 219](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/232:5.6?vid=65404)Take of the Roots of Sorrel two ounces, of the Leaves of Endive, Succory, and Mallows, each one handful; of the Seeds of Lettice, and of white Poppies, each three drams; of white and red Sanders, each half a dram; of the Flowers of Violets, and of Water-lillies, each one Pugil; make a Decoction, add to it a little Rose-vinegar, foment the Region of the Stomach with it warm. After the Fomentation, anoint the part with Oyl of Roses and Oyl of Violets mixed. Cataplasms are not convenient in the beginning, because they oppress the part by their Weight, and by retaining the Heat increase the Inflammation. If the Disease come to a Declination, and if the Tumour should be resolved, which is most to be wished for, a resolving Fomentation may be applied made in the following manner. Take of the Roots of Florentine-orris two ounces, of the Leaves of Mint, Marjoram, Penny-royal, and of Roman Wormwood, each one Handful; of the Seeds of Fenugreek and of Annise, each two drams; of the grains of Kermes one dram, of the Flowers of Staechas, Rosemary, and Camomil, each one Pugil; adding towards the the end a little White-wine, make a Decoction, wherewith foment the Region of the Stomach. After the Fomentation, anoint the Part with Oyl of Nutmeg, Wormwood, Nard, and the like; to which Wax, and the Powder of Florentine-orris, and of Cinnamon being added, an Oyntment may be made; but Plaisters and Cataplasms are not convenient, because they oppress the Part. But if the Tumour seem to tend to Suppuration, foment the part with a Decoction of the Flowers of Camomil, and red Roses, and afterwards apply the following Cataplasm. Take of the Roots of Marsh-mallows two ounces, of the Leaves of Bears-breech, and of Roses, each one handful; boil them well, and then add of the Flower of Barley, and of Linseeds, and Faenugreek-seeds, and of the Powder [Page 220](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/233:5.6?vid=65404) of Camomil, each half an ounce; of white and red Sanders, each two drams; with Oyl of Roses and of Camomil, and with a little Hens-grease, make a Cataplasm to be renewed often. The Abscess being broken, cleanse the Ulcer by drinking Hydromel, to which must be added sometimes, according to Galen's order, Manna of Frankincense, or Barly-water, with Sugar of Roses in the beginning in a hot Constitution. When the Ulcer grows old, from what cause soever it prooceeds, Broths are proper, altered with cooling, and moderately astringent Herbs, Barly-broths sweetned with Sugar of Roses, new Milk sweetned with Sugar and a little Honey, Steel-waters for the ordinary drink, or Water wherein some Bole-armonick or sealed Earth has been infused; to which may be added, a little red rough Wine, if there be but little Heat in the Part; afterward the following Apozem may be used. Take of whole Barley one Pugil, of the Leaves of Scabious, Agrimony, Burnet, and of Maiden-hair, each half an handful; of the seeds of Melons two drams, of red Roses dried one Pugil; make a Decoction to one Pint, wherein dissolve three ounces of Syrup of dried Roses, make an Apozem for four doses to be frequently repeated. For internal Ulcers, a Decoction of China is also very good, when there is no Feaver, for being taken for twenty Days or more, it gently provokes Sweat, and dries the Ulcer by degrees. But if there be danger of a Consumption, the foresaid Root must be boiled in Chicken-broth, with the foresaid Herbs, and with cleansed Barley. When the Ulcer has continued long, Chalybeat or Purging Waters drank for a Month do good; and gentle Catharticks, as Rubarb, and Tamarinds, Myrobalans, Syrup of Roses, are to be used once a Week. Lastly, The following things are to be used. [Page 221](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/234:5.6?vid=65404)Take of Bole-armenick, sealed Earth, red Coral, Blood-stone well washed in Rose-water, each one dram; of Dragons-blood, Gum-arabick, and Tragacanth, each half a dram; of the Seeds of white Poppies gently bruised and roasted, of Hypocistis, Sarcoco, and Frankincense, each one Scruple; of Sugar of Roses one ounce; make a Powder, whereof let him take a dram in Plantane-water, or with Conserve of Roses daily. Or of the same Powder may be made an Opiat with Conserve of Comfry, and Roses, and with Syrup of Quinces or of Myrtles; or Troches may be made of it, with the Mucilages of the Seeds of Psyllium, or of Tragacanth; of all which the Sick may take by turns, least his Stomach turn by taking of one Medicine a long while: And outwardly, to heal the Ulcer, may be applied to the Region of the Stomach, a Fomentation made of Wormwood, Roses, Pomegranate-peel, Galls, Balaustins, Myrtles, Frankincense, Mastich, and the like: And afterwards the part must be anointed with some Astringent Oyntment, and an Astringent Plaister must 222](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/235:5.6?vid=65404) CHAP. LXX. Of the Chollick. IT takes its name from the Gut Colon, which is the part affected, which is long and winding, and designed by Nature to receive the Excrements of almost all the Body; and when those Excrements are retained too long, they are wont to occasion Pains of this kind. Therefore the Causes of the Chollick is all Excrementitious Matter, that occasions a Solution of the Continuum, either by distending, pricking, or corroding, and is either Wind or Humours. Wlnd generated by Crudities, or from a cold Intemperies of the Stomach or Bowels, if it cannot be seasonably excluded, by reason the Feces are very hard, or by reason the Intestines are obstructed, it is heap'd up in a great quantity in the great Guts, especially in the Colon, and occasions violent Pain. Thick Cold and Flegmatick Humours, stufft into the Tunicks of the Guts, may occasion such Pains by corroding them, if they are indued with Acrimony or by chilling them; which consequently occasions Costiveness and Convulsions, as Galen says of himself, that he having a violent Chollick, evacuated glassy Flegm which was actually cold. Wind, which is easily elevated by a weak and gentle Heat from gross and clammy Humours, may also occasion this Pain. Cholerick and Acrid Humours, and also Melancholly and Acid, may occasion these Pains, by vellicating and pricking the Intestines: But in the Action of these Causes, it may be asked how the Chollick Pain should have Exacerbations and Remissions, the same Matter remaining in the Bowels, which as long as it is there should always bite and distend them. To which I answer, that that Matter does sometimes remain quiet, and then it occasions little or no Pain; but sometimes is moved and excited by various Fermentations that happen to the Humours, as is wont to happen to the Falling-sickness, Hysterick Fits, and in Fits of Feavers. [Page 223](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/236:5.6?vid=65404)But we must take notice, that the Wind or Humours do not only reside in the Cavity of the Intestines, for then they would be easily excluded by things that Evacuate and Cleanse, and by Carminative Medicines; but most commonly they are fixed in the very Tunicks of the Intestines; upon which account it is difficult to remove them, and so they occasion an obstinate Disease. The Gross, Flegmatick and Melancholly Humours, flow by little and little through the Veins of the Intestines, and so do not presently cause Pain, till there is a quantity sufficient to irritate Nature for their Expulsion, and then being moved cause Pain; or Wind occasioned by them, and included in the Coats of the Intestines distends them, and not easily getting out occasions a lasting Pain; also Choler after the same manner, poured through the Veins of the Intestines upon their Coats, and imbibed by them, causes violent Pains, which are wont to be long and obstinate, because it is difficultly removed from their substance. There is another Species of a bilious Chollick, which degenerates into a Palsie, scarce known unto the Ancients, which proceeds from a bilious Humour, not poured as the former upon the Colon, but upon the Membranes of the Abdomen which is transferred thither, either from the Gall-Bladder, or from the Mesentery in the Crisis of long Feavers, or by reason of violent Anger, or some other external Cause, when because of Obstructions it cannot be carried to the common Passages, but by a Preposterous Motion is put off suddenly upon the foresaid Membranes of the Abdomen: And hence great Pain arises like the Chollick, which yields neither to Glisters nor Fomentations, nor any other Remedy, but continues for many Months, by which the Body wasts, and the Sick is vexed with a sort of intermitting Feaver, and often with a slow continual Feaver; at length the Pain remitting, a Palsie succeeds, that Humour leasurely creeping through the Membranes of the Abdomen to the Spine of the Back; but this Palsie chiefly possesses the upper parts; yet there is most commonly a Pain in the Thighs and Legs, and in some few the use of them is wholly taken away, and sometimes it breaks in upon the ra, and causes the Falling-sickness, from whence Death generally follows. [Page 224](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/237:5.6?vid=65404)There are other causes of the Chollick, but less frequent, viz. Stones growing in the Guts, Worms wound up in a bottom and obstructing the Intestines, a Compression of the Guts by a Tumour of the neighbouring parts, and the narrowness of them, by reason of an Inflammation, and other Tumours of the Guts, or a twisting of them occasioned by Wind, which is next to an Iliack Passion, and sometimes the Matter which causes a Chollick is Venomous and Malignant. Lastly, All hard Bodies, by obstructing the Guts, or distending them, may occasion a Chollick, as stones generated in the Guts, a great quantity of Cherry-stones, hard Cheese, and the like. As Platerus relates of a certain Governour, a long while troubled with the Chollick and Convulsions, who after the use of Glisters, evacuated a great quantity of hard Cheese by Stool. The External Causes are a cold Constitution of the Air pressing and hardning the Belly, or a hot Constitution which does likewise harden the Excrements, the use of Meat and Drink unfit for the Mans Constitution, of crud and harsh Roots, and of gross Meats of hard Digestion, too much rest, immoderate Sleep, unseasonable Exercise, immoderate Venery, and other External Causes which may injure the Concoction of the Stomach. The Diagnosticks of this Disease are plain, for first the Pain is violent, sometimes afflicting grievously this part, sometimes that, sometimes it possesses the Region of the Spleen, sometimes of the Stomach or Liver, or of the Reins, sometimes it is above, sometimes below the Navel, and oftentimes it is most violent in the left side; the Patient often Vomits, the Pain is increased after Eating, the Belly is most commonly bound. The Signs of the Causes are distinguished in the following manner, If the Pain proceed from Flegm, it is not violent, unless it be accompanied with Wind; the Sick is eased by hot things, and injured by cold things, a course of Diet before apt to increase Flegm preceded. If the Chollick is occasioned by Wind, there is a stretching Pain, and a certain Inflation of the Belly; the Sick perceive a great deal of Wind, and a rumbling in the Belly; they are much eased by breaking Wind, a course of Diet fit to breed Wind was used before, as unseasonably [Page 225](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/238:5.6?vid=65404) drinking cold Water, the frequent use of Pulse, Turneps, and Chesnuts, Herbs and Fruits, and the like; and if the the Wind be contained in the Cavity of the Intestins, the Pain is wandring, and not fixed to one part, and is renewed by Intervals. But if it be kept in within the Coats of the Guts, the Pain is fixed and is continual and obstinate because it cannot find Vent. If the Chollick proceeds from an acrid and Cholerick Humour, it is most sharp, there is a twitching and pricking Heat, Drouth, and for the most part a Feaver, the Disease is increased by hot Medicines and Diet, and is mitigated by cold. By the following Signs the Chollick and Nephritick Pain may be distinguished, if they are accurately examined. First, The Nephritick Pain is fixed in the Kidney, and stretches it self from that to the Testes according to the length of the Ureter, but the Chollick is wandring, and painfully girds the lower Belly. Secondly, The Chollick increases after eating, by reason of the pressure upon the Gut by a full Stomach, but the Nephritick Pain is not at all increased after eating, but rather lessened, because some of the Nutritious Juice is carried to the Veins which somewhat asswages the Pain. Thirdly, In the Chollick Vomiting is more severe, and the Belly is more bound, because the Colon lies near the Bottom of the Stomach, and the Intestines being full or violently provoked, contract themselves that they may expel the common Enemy; but either of the Symptoms is common to either of the Diseases; so that the Intention or Remission of them has a difficult Diagnostick. For the Nephritick Pain being intense, may occasion greater Vomiting, and bind the Belly more than a remiss Chollick. Fourthly, In the Chollick, the Patient is more eased by Vomiting and going to Stool, than in Nephirtick Pains, Fifthly, In the Nephritick Pain, the Urine is first clear and thin, afterwards something settles to the Bottom, and at length Sand or Gravel is evacuated; bu in the Chollick the Urine is thicker from the beginning. The Cure of this Disease must be varied according to [Page 226](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/239:5.6?vid=65404) the Variety of the Causes: And first, There is the same Way of Cure for a Windy and Flegmatick Chollick, you must begin with an emollient Glister, and afterwards you must give a Carminative and discutient Glister, which must be repeated twice, thrice, or four times in a day, till the Pain be gone; but if after the use of one or two Glisters, the Sick does not go to Stool, as sometimes it happens, the Belly must be irritated by a sharp Suppository, but it is convenient to add to one of the Glisters four ounces of the Aqua-benedicta, or two or three drams of Coloquintida may be boiled in an emolient and Carminative Glister. If Glisters do not give ease you must not obstinately persist in the use of them; for it has been observed, that when a Sick Person has taken, without any Success, twenty Glisters, another Physician having given only an ounce and an half of Manna, with two ounces of Oyl of Almonds in fat Broth has cured the Patient. But in that Pain which proceeds from thick Flegm, stronger Medicines must be given. Afterwards Fomentations, Oyntments, Baths, Plaisters and other Remedies are useful, to which must be added some Specificks. Boil simple Water, and when it is boiling hot, add a fourth part of common Oyl, and some grains of pepper grosly beaten. Let the Sick take three or four Spoonfuls as hot as he can bear it, the pain will be gone as it were in a Moment. Take of the best Aloes one dram, of Laudanum Opiatum grains four; mingle them, make six Pills, gild them, let the Sick take them at a convenient time, they give ease in an hours Time, and afterwards purge off the noxious Humours. Instead of the Pills, a Potion may be taken made of half an ounce of Diaphaenicon, and two Scruples of Philonium Romanum in the Water or Decoction, of Camomil. Take of the Oyl of Almonds, or of some other Oyl, for poor People, four ounces; of generous Wine one ounce, of Syrup of Poppies one ounce; mingle ehem, make a Potion. [Page 227](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/240:5.6?vid=65404)Oyl of sweet Almonds also taken with Manna in fat Broth asswages the Pain, and evacuates the Peccant Matter. If the Disease is lasting, it may be successfully treated with a Decoction of Guajacum continued for many Days, purging now and then with Elixir Salutis, and injecting Glisters frequently. But if the Chollick proceed from Flegm, boil the Guajacum with Wine. A Bilious Cholick is cured by emolient Glisters, and with such things as attemperate the Acrimony of the Humours. Give Juleps of the Waters of Erratick Poppy, of Lettice and Sorrel, with the Syrups of Violets, Apples, and Lemons: If the Pain is very violent we must use Narcoticks; the Pain being somewhat mitigated. An Infusion of Rubarb in Succory-water is to be given with Syrup of Roses, and to be repeated often, till the Stock of Matter is evacuated. If gentle Purging be not sufficient to eradicate the Disease, we must use Mercurius Dulcis, which being given sometimes with purging Medicines that have Diagridium in them perfects the Cure. They that dislike Diagridium, may give Mercurius Dulcis alone made into Pills, with Conserve of Roses, drinking upon them an Infusion of Rubarb and Senna, with Manna, and Syrup of Roses added to it. Afterwards it will be convenient to use Tunbridge or such like Waters. When the Pain is violent, you must fly to Laudanum, with which Catharticks may be sometimes given, but in a large Dose, because they are much blunted by Laudanum. Bleeding is sometimes proper in this sort of Chollick, when there is danger, least the Violence of the Heat should occasion a Feaver; if there be a Feaver already it is presently to be used. When there is a great Drouth cold Water must be given, according to Galens Instruction. And Amatus Lusitanus says, he wonderfully cured of a sudden such a Pain by the use of it; and Septalius declares, in two Observations, that he used it inwardly and outwardly with great Success. For the Cure of a Chollick that degenerates into a Plsie, [Page 228](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/241:5.6?vid=65404) put the Patient into a warm Bath, made of a Decoction of emollient things, the Belly being loosned with various Glisters, and the first Passages opened by Catharticks, the Patient must be bathed twice or thrice, or four or five times in a day, that the Acrimony of the Humours may be attemperated, and that the Pores of the Membranes may be opened. The next day let the Humour be purged with some proper Cathartick, and then the Bath must be repeated, and so you must do every other day, if the Patient be able to bear it, till the Humours being purged off, and the pain quieted, he is recovered. In the mean time you must continue the use of Glisters, but those made with Milk are best to asswage the Pain, to which may be added Cassia, Oyl of Violets, and Oyl of Lillies. Let the Belly be frequently anointed with Oyl of Camomil, of Dill, sweet Almonds, Lillies, and with Butter. Lastly, Use Whey and Tunbridge-waters, or the like; and if the Disease continues a long while, those things may be used which are proper to cure Hypochondriack Melancholly; and Bleeding is to be used at the beginning of the Disease, and before Purging, and to be often repeated, if the Blood seem to be bad, or if something of a Rheumatism seems to be joyned wtih it. Lastly, All those Remedies which are proposed for the Cure of a Bilious Chollick may be used in this Case; and if these things do no good, some Physicians prescribe the following Potion, which though it be loathsome, and will not go down with the delicate, yet they say it presently mitigates the Pain. Take of Horse-dung one ounce, crumble it in small Pieces, and infuse it in a Pint of Erratick Poppy-water, to which add eight or ten drops of Spirit of Wine. Strain it gently, and divide it into three Doses to be taken when the Pain is most violent. But if the Disease degenerates into a Palsie, you must use to the Spine of the Back, and the paralitick Parts, some resolving Balsam, and such an one as strengthens the Nerves, if there be a Feaver; but if there be no Feaver, you may apply Wooll dipt in Oyl or Ointment to the Paralitick [Page 229](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/242:5.6?vid=65404) Parts, taking great Care that the Patient does not catch Cold, for by that means the Humour will be more fixt upon the parts, and the Perspiration of it will be hindred. CHAP. LXXI. Of the Bilious Chollick of the Years 1670, 71, 72. IN all these Years the Blood was much inclined to put off upon the Bowels hot and Cholerick Humours, upon which Account this Chollick was more frequent than is usual: The same Febrile Symptoms preceded this Disease as used to go before the Dysentery, that reigned in those times; and sometimes this Disease followed the Dysentery, when it had a long while afflicted the Patient, and was just about to leave him; but when it did not follow a long Dysentery, it generally took its Rise from a Feaver, which after some Hours was wont to end in this Disease; it chiefly seised Young People of a hot and Cholerick Constitution, especially in the Summer the Pain of the Bowels was extreamly violent, and more intollerable than any other that afflicts poor Mortals; it sometimes binds as it were the Guts, and sometimes being contracted to a Point, it bores like an Auger; the Pain now and then remits, and presently the Fit approaches again, which as soon as the Patient perceives, he looks sadly, and bemoans himself, as if it were actually upon him. At the beginning of this Disease the Pain is not so certainly determined to one Point, as in the Progress of it; nor is the Vomiting so frequent, or does the Belly so obstinately resist Catharticks; but the more the Pain is increased, the more pertinaciously is it fixed in a Point, the Vomiting is more frequent, and the Belly more bound, till at length by the dreadful Force of these Symptoms, a total subversion of the Peristaltick Motion of the Guts, if the Patient be not relieved; and by consequence an Iliack Passion is procured, in which Disease all purging Medicines become presently Emetick, and Glisters that are injected are vomited up with the Excrements. [Page 230](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/243:5.6?vid=65404)The Matter that is cast up after this Manner, if it be sincere, and without mixture, is sometimes green, and sometimes Yellow, and sometimes of an unusual Colour. In order to the Cure, I bleed freely in the Arm, if no Blood has been taken away before, and after two or three Hours I give an Anodyne; the next day I prescribe some gentle Purge, and order that it should be repeated. The next day save one, and sometimes thrice, according as the Relicks of the Humour are more or less. But we must take notice, that if this Disease proceeds from eating too much Fruit, or from any Meat of hard Digestion, upon which account ill and corrupted Juices are first transmitted to the Blood, and afterwards to the Bowels: I say in this Case the Stomach must be washed with large draughts of Posset-drink, which must be vomited up again; which being done, an Anodyne must be given and the next Day a Vein must be opened; and as to other things, you proceed according to the Directions above mentioned; but when the Violence of the Pain, and the Vomiting (by reason of which the Guts are as it were inverted) do resist the Operation of the Catharticks, for it is in vain to give a gentle Purge, unless the Patient is easily purged, which must be carefully inquired into; for such a Medicine being not strong enough to make its way through the Intestines, the Patient is more injured thereby; for by its ineffectual Agitation the Vomiting and the pain are increased. A lenitive purging Potion of the Infusion of Tamarinds, of the Leaves of Senna, and Rubarb, in which may be dissolved Manna, and Syrup of Roses, is to be preferred before other Catharticks, for it least exagitates and moves the Humours; but if the Sick cannot retain a Liquid Medicine by reason of an Aversion, or because of the Vomiting, you must necessarily use Pills; among which the Pill Coch pleases me best, for they pass best through the Body in this, and in most other Cases. But when the Weakness of the Stomach, or the Vomiting is so great, that the Pills cannot be retained, then I first order an Anodyne, and a few hours after a Purge; but there must be so much space betwixt them, that the Cathartick be not quelled by the Narcotick, and so rendred ineffectual; but that it may continue so long in the Stomach [Page 131](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/244:5.6?vid=65404) as is necessary for its imparting its purgative Quality to it, that it may operate when the Vertue of the Narcotick is spent, though the purge, if it could be conveniently done, is best given a long while after the Anodyn, for twelve hours after taking it, the patient is difficultly purged. But because in this, as well as in most other Diseases wherein Narcoticks are indicated, a purge always increases the pain (at least when it has done working, for while it is in Operation the patient is not so ill) therefore I usually give an Anodyne as soon as the purge has done working, which I order to be taken Morning and Evening daily betwixt the purges, that I may the more certainly appease the pain, till the patient has been sufficiently purged. The purging of the Humours being over, I endeavour to bridle the Fury of the Disease (which now only remains to be done) by giving an Anodyne constantly Morning and Evening, which must be sometimes repeated oftner; nor could I ever take off violent Pains without a larger Dose than is usual, and that repeated too; for that which is sufficient to vanquish another Disease, will be altogether insufficient in this Case, the violence of the Disease subduing the force of the Medicine: And it is indeed safe to repeat Narcoticks, while such a Pain as this continues violent, but not when it is gone off. Wherefore I repeat the Anodyne according to the degree of the Pain till it ceases, or till it be very much lessened. Yet there must be such a Space of Time between them, that you may find what may be hoped for from the former Dose, before another be given; but for the most part unless the Pain be very violent, a Paregorick given Morning and Evening may be sufficient. Liquid Laudanum is the Anodyne I chiefly use, whereof I give Sixteen Drops in some cordial Water; or the dose may be increased according to the violence of the Pain. But here I must admonish you, that though I have said Bleeding and purging must necessarily precede this quieting Method, yet sometimes upon occasion both being omitted, you must begin with Anodynes. For Instance, when by reason of some preceding Sickness, large Evacuations have been used not long before the Coming [Page 232](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/245:5.6?vid=65404) of the Chollick, for many Times they who have recovered of another Disease have fell suddenly into this, by reason of the Weakness of the Bowels; especially if there be a great degree of Heat occasioned by drinking of Wine or some other Spiritous Liquor immoderately; I say in this Case, it is not only unnecessary, but I think it is injurious, to give Catharticks again; for by them new Tumults will be raised. Moreover, The Guts are most commonly sufficiently cleansed by Glisters frequently used, before the Physician is advised with; so that partly for this cause, and partly by reason of the long continuance of the Disease, Narcoticks seem in a manner to be only useful. But because this pain of it's own Nature is wont to return more than any other, all Occasions of its Relapse must be prevented, by giving an Anodyne twice a day for some days; but if as often as the Narcotick is intermitted, the pain now and then returns, as it sometimes happens, I do not know any thing that will so certainly perfect the Cure, as riding on Horseback, or in a Coach, with which the Patient must take long Journies; and in the mean while an Anodyne must be given constantly Morning and Evening. But Riding must not be used before the Patient has been well purged, and then it must be continued for many Days. If the Patient be young, and of a hot Constitution, I order a cooling and thickning Diet, suppose Pulp of Barly, Panada, and the like; and every third Day, if the Stomach is craving, a Chick or a Whiteing boiled; and I allow no other Drink than small Beer, or Milk-water, and this is all I order, unless Riding necessary to recover the Health requires more nourishing Food, and more generous Liquor, whereby the Spirits exhausted by Exercise may be repaired. But when the Disease, being unskilfully treated, has a long while afflicted the Patient, so that the Bowels become weak and infirm, and he is in a manner quite wasted, I say in this Case we find by experience, that the free use of Epidemick Water, or of Aqua-mirabilis, or any other the Patient likes best, relieves him at this Time beyond Expectation, [Page 233](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/246:5.6?vid=65404)Moreover, As in the Cure of the Disease, so when it is over, the thin Diet we have mentioned must be observed for some time; for this Disease being more apt to return than any other, and seating it self upon the principle parts of Concoction, the least error in this kind will presently occasion much Pain: Wherefore in this and all other Diseases of the Bowels, Meats of hard Digestion are carefully to be avoided, and things of easie Digestion must be taken only in such a Quantity as will suffice to sustain Life. CHAP. LXXII. Of the Hysterick Chollick. A Certain kind of Hysterick Disease afflicts some Women very like the Bilious Chollick, both as to the Sharpness and Situation of the Pain; and also upon the account of the Humours ejected by Vomit of a Yellow and green Colour. But least any one should take it for the Bilious Chollick just now mentioned, I will treat of it in a Chapter by it Self. Those Women that are of a lax and crude Habit of Body, are chiefly afflicted with this Disease; and they that have lately laboured under some other Hysterick Indisposition, (or which is very often) those that have scarce evaded a difficult and hard Labour in bringing forth a large Child, whereby the Mothers Natural Strength has been almost Spent. A Pain, as violent almost as that of the Chollick or Iliack Passion, seises the Region of the Stomach; and sometimes it comes a little lower, and then violent Vomitings follow, and the Matter which is cast up is sometimes yellow, and sometimes green. And moreover, (which I have often observed) there is a greater Dejection of Spirit, and Despiration, than in any other Disease whatever. After a day or two the Pain goes off, and returns again in a few Weeks after as violent as it was before; sometimes it is accompanied with the Jaundice, which is very visible, and which goes off of its own accord in a few days, when all [Page 234](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/247:5.6?vid=65404) the Symptoms are gone off; and when the Patient seems very well, the Smallest Disorder of Mind, whether it be occasioned by Anger or Sorrow (to both which in this Case Women are very prone) almost recalls the Pain, which may be said of walking, or any other Exercise used too soon, for by these means Vapours are elevated in a Lax and weak Habit of Body; when according to the Vulgar Opinion I say Vapours, whither they be so or no, or whither they are Convulsions of particular parts, the Phaenomena may be solved either way. These Vapours or Convulsions, when they invade this or that Region of the Body, produce Symptoms agreeable to the part they invade, and though they are one and the same Disease every where, yet they cunningly resemble most of the Diseases Mankind is exposed to. Bleeding and Purging repeated, which were plainly indicated at the beginning of a Bilious Chollick, are not to be used here, but the whole Business must be done by Anodyns, unless a great Quantity of Blood and Humours so resists the operation of the Narcotick, that though it be often repeated, it cannot quell the Tumult, till the Patient is blooded and purged, which I have observed in Women of a very sanguine Constitution, and in Virago's. If the Case is so, Bleeding or Purging, or perchance both, must make Way for the Anodyne; for either of these being used, a moderate dose of the Narcotick will perform the Business, which otherwise would signifie nothing, though the largest Dose is given: But this seldom happens, and these Remedies must not be repeated; and when they are used, when there is need of them, you must proceed in giving Anodynes in that Method which I have proposed in the Bilious Chollick; and they must be taken often or seldom according to the degrees of Pain. But for as much as this Disease, in Hypochondriack as well as in Hysterick People, often ends in the Jaundice, and as this comes on that goes off, we must take notice that in curing this kind of Jaundice, all Catharticks are to be wholly omitted; or if they are given, you must use only Rubarb, or some other gentle Purge; for there is danger least by purging new Tumults should arise, and so all the Symptoms return; and therefore in this Case nothing must be done presently, seeing the Jaundice taking its Rise on this Account, [Page 235](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/248:5.6?vid=65404) generally lessens of its own accord, and wholly vanishes in a short time: But if it continues a long while and seems to go off difficultly, Remedies must be taken for it. I use the following. Take of the Roots of Madder, and of Turmerick, each one ounce; of all the greater Celandine, and of the Tops of the lesser Centaury, each one handful; boil them in equal parts of Rhenish-wine, and of Fountain Water to a quart; in the Liquor strained dissolve two ounces of the Syrup of the five opening Roots; mingle them, make an Apozem. Let the Patient take half a pint Morning and Evening till he is well. But if the Jaundice comes of it self, the Chollick not going before it is necessary, besides the alteratives just mentioned. To give Cholagogues, that is such things as purge Choler by Stool, viz. once or twice before the Patient enters upon the Apozem prescribed, and afterwards once a Week, as long as he takes it. As, Take of the Electuary of the Juice of Roses two drams, of Rubarb finely powdered half a dram, of Cream of Tartar one scruple; make a Bolus with a sufficient quantity of Syrup of Rubarb with Succory; give it early in the Morning; let the Patient drink upon it a small draught of Rhenish-wine. But if notwithstanding the constant taking of these things a long while, the Disease continues obstinate, the Patient must drink Tunbridge-waters, or such like, from the Fountain every Morning till he recovers. [Page 236](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/249:5.6?vid=65404) CHAP. LXXIII. Of the Iliack Passion. THis dreadful Disease being hitherto almost in the Opinion of all Mortal, takes its Rise from the inverted and preposterous Motion of the Intestines, to wit, the Fibres of the Intestines, which ought to be contracted from the Superior toward the Inferior, are drawn to the Superior; and whatsoever is contained in the Intestines, is not protruded to the Belly, but towards the Stomach, and is violently regurgitated to the Mouth, so that Glisters, how sharp soever become vomitive; and also Catharticks taken by the Mouth are suddenly cast up by Vomit. And in my Opinion, the exquisite and intollerable Pain coming upon this Disease, is only occasioned by the foresaid preposterous Motion of the Intestines; for whereas those Folds, which the many Circumvolutions of the Intestines make, are so formed by Nature, that they should most fitly conduce to the carrying down of the Faeces: When they, I say, are forced to give way to a Motion contrary to their Fibres, the aforesaid Pain is occasioned from thence, which is fixed to one part, and is like the boreing of an Auger, when either the Valve, which is placed at the Beginning of the Colon, hinders the going back of the Excrements to the Ilion, or any other Membrane belonging to the Sinus sustains alone the Force of this preposterous Impulse. We may assign a twofold Cause of this Inversion, from whence the Pain arises, viz. Obstruction and Iritation. First therefore, Whatever violently obstructs the Intestines, so that nothing can pass downwards, necessarily produces this contrary Motion in them. Among these Authors are wont to reckon the Excrements hardened, gross Wind collected in a great quantity, and tying up as it were the Intestines, the Constriction of them in a Rupture: And lastly An Inflammation, and other great Tumours, which stop up the Internal Cavity of the Intestine. In the mean time we must not deny, that this contrary Motion, owing its [Page 237](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/250:5.6?vid=65404) rise to these Causes, is rather to be accounted the Motion of these things taken in, than of the Intestines; nor is this an Inversion of the whole Duct of the Intestines, but only of those which are situated above the Seat of that Obstruction; wherefore I call an Iliack Passion proceeding hence spurious. Secondly, I think that in the Iliack Passion, the cause of the Inversion of the Peristaltick Motion of the Intestines, is most commonly after this Manner, viz. Sharp and malignant Humours are cast upon the Stomach, and the Guts that are next to it, by which the Motion of the Stomach is inverted, and forced violently to cast up what is contained in it; at length the small Guts that are joined to the Stomack being weakned, yield to the violent Motion of it, and with them at last the greater follow by Consent; the Stomach Vomiting, leading as it were the Dance, this I call a true Iliack Passion, and which is treated of now. The Method of cureing it has been hitherto in a manner unknown, whatever some boast of the use of Quicksilver and Bullets, which besides that they do little good, are very oft injurious. I have successfully used the following Method, When it appears by Glisters cast up by the Mouth, and other Signs, that it is a true Iliack Passion, I endeavour these three things. First, That the contrary Motion of the Stomach, which causes the like Motion of the Guts, may be hindred. Secondly, That the Intestines being weakned by the sharp Humour may be corroborated. Thirdly, That the Stomach and Guts be freed from these Humours. And that I may Answer these Indications, I institute the Cure after this Manner. First, I prescribe one Scruple of Salt of Wormwood in a spoonful of Juice of Lemons to be taken Morning and Evening; but at other times of the Day I order some spoonfuls of Mint Water, without Sugar or any thing else, to be taken twice in an Hour; by the repeated use of which alone, the Vomiting and the Pain arising from thence will soon vanish. At the same time I order a living Kitling to lie continually upon the naked Belly. But after the Pain and Vomiting has wholly ceased for the Space of two or three Days, I give one dram of the Pill Coch-major [Page 238](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/251:5.6?vid=65404) dissolved in Mint-water, which I also order to be used very often, all the time of the working of the Pills, that I may the more certainly hinder the Return of the Vomiting; nor is the Kitling to be removed, before the Patient has taken the Pills. I have observed, that it is to no purpose to give these Pills, or any other Purge, how strong soever, until the Stomack is strengthned, and reduced to its Natural Motion, and the Guts also to that which is proper to them; for otherwise all Catharticks taken inwardly would prove Emetick, and so do more hurt than good, and therefore I do not use Purging Medicines, until for some Time I have used those Medicines which respect the Stomach. I prescribe a very thin Diet, for I allow onely some spoonfuls of Chicken-broath to be taken twice or thrice a day; in the mean while I order the Patient to keep his Bed all the Time of the Sickness, till the Signs of perfect Health appear; and when he is well I appoint him to persist in the use of the foresaid Water for a long Time, and to keep his Belly warm with Flannels doubled, that there may not be a Relapse where unto this Disease is very prone. CHAP. LXXIV. Of Costiveness. BY Costiveness we do not understand a pefect Stoppage of the Belly, so that nothing is evacuated downwards as happens in the Iliack Passion, but only a slow and unsuitable Evacuation that Way, whereby the Excrements, and the Relicts of the Meat are seldom ejected, and not according to the quantity taken in. When the Belly is bound, Vapours arise to the Head, and Catarrhs and Diseases of the Brain are produced, the Concoction is hindred, and the Actions of other Parts. For the Cure of this Disease the following Medicines must be used. [Page 239](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/252:5.6?vid=65404)Take of the Roots of Marsh-mallows, and of Lillies, each two ounces; of the Leaves of Mallows, Marshmallows, Mercury, Violets, Bears-breach, each one Handful; of Linseed, and Fenugreek-seeds, each half an ounce; of the Seeds of Annise one dram and an half, of sweet Prunes three pair, of the Flowers of Camomil, and Melilot, each one Pugil; boil them to a Pint and an half, in the strained Liquor dissolve of Oyl of Lillies, and of Fenugreek-seeds, each two ounces; of fresh-butter half an ounce, of Catholicon Duplicatum, and of Diaprunum simplex, each six drams; make a Glister to be injected as often as there is Occasion. But we must endeavour to loosen the Belly by other Remedies, because by the frequent use of Glisters Nature grows more slothful, and at length will never ease the Body without a Glister. To this End sweet Prunes, or roasted Aples, are to be eaten an hour before Meals, or in a Decoction of Prunes an ounce of Mauna must be dissolved. The following Broth certainly loosens the Belly and keeps it loose for some Days. Take of the Leaves of Beet and Mercury, each one handful, boil them in common Broth, let it be taken an Hour before Dinner. [Page 240](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/253:5.6?vid=65404) CHAP. LXXV. Of a Lientery, and the Caeliack Passion. A Lientery is a sort of Loosness, wherein the Meat is voided in a short time, nothing altered, but as it was taken in at the Mouth: In the Caeliack Passion the Nourishment is voided crude and imperfectly digested. There are many Causes of the Lientery and Caeliack Passion proposed by Authors, all which may be reduced to three Heads; viz. A cold Intemperies of the Stomach and Intestines; an Irritation of those Parts, and a great Debility of the retentive Faculty, from a grievous and deadly Disease. There is another Cause different from those mentioned, which uses peculiarly to produce the Caeliack Passion, viz. The Obstruction of the Meseraick Veins, whhich stops the Passage of the Chyle. Aetius and Celsus, and many of their followers, do propose another Cause of the Lientery, viz. A hard Cicatrix upon the Intestines produced by a Dysentery, The Cure of this Disease is to be varied according to the Variety of the Causes producing it: And first, that which is occasioned by a Flegmatick Humour, may be Cured with the following Remedies; but you must begin by Purging Medicines made of Aloes, Rubarb, and Mirobalans, Take of old Conserve of Roses six ounces, of the best Venice Treacle six drams, Marmalad of Quinces a sufficient quantity, mix them. Let the Sick take half a dram in the Morning drinking nothing upon it. Or, Take of Japan Earth one dram and an half, of red Coral and Crabs-eyes prepared, each one dram; of old Conserve of Roses one ounce and an half, of Balsamick Syrup a sufficient quantity; mix them, make an Electuary. [Page 241](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/254:5.6?vid=65404)The Quantity of a Nutmeg of it may be taken Morning and Evening. Take of Gum-caranna, of the Magisterial Stomach Plaister, each a sufficient Quantity; of the Chymical Oyl of Wormwood twelve drops; mix them, make a Plaister for the Region of the Stomach. That which proceeds from a bilious Humour, is to be cured with the following Remedies. Take of the best Aloes washed in Rose-water three drams, of Rubarb powdered and moistened with Borrage-water one dram, of Mastich, red Sanders, red Coral prepared, each one scruple; of Syrup of Roses solutive a sufficient quantity; make a Mass for Pills, of which let the Sick take half a dram, or one dram at a time. Take of sealed Earth, Bole-Armenick, red Coral prepared, Pearls prepared, of the Seeds of Purslain and Sorrel each one dram, of the Shavings of Hartshorn, and of the Leaves of Mint dried, each one scruple, of red Roses half a Pugil; make a Powder to be sprinkled upon Broth, or to be taken in a Spoon with a little Water wherein Iron hath been quenched. But if the Stools be pure Chyle, this Distemper does not proceed from the Fault of the Stomach, but from the Obstruction of the Meseraick Veins, which is very frequent, and is chiefly incident to Children, therefore it is to be cured with Remedies that open Obstructions. [Page 242](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/255:5.6?vid=65404) CHAP. LXXVI. Of a Diarrhea. A Diarrhea, is that sort of a Loosness, in which excrementitious Humours, without Blood, Chyle or Ulceration of the Intestines are voided by Stool. There is another Species of a Diarrhea which is called colliquative, arising from the Colliquation of the Substance of the Body. If a Diarrhea be critical, and is easily born, and the Disease goes off by it, or is greatly diminished, the Sick is benefited by it. But if a Diarrhea be Symptomatical, it occasions a great deal of Pain to the Sick, the Strength greatly decreases, and the Disease upon which it comes is considerably augmented, or at least does not decrease. As to the Cure a Symptomatick Diarrhea rises for the most part from bad and corrupted Humours, therefore the Cure of it is to be begun with the Evacuation of the Peccant Humour. Take of the best Rhubarb six grains, of the Seeds of Coriander bruised two scruples, infuse and boil them in a sufficient quantity of Fountain-water, to three ounces of the strained Liquor, add of Rubarb torrified one Scruple, of the Syrup of Succory with Rubarb one ounce, mix them, make a Draught to be taken in the Morning. A Vomit is also sometimes convenient, because it makes a Revulsion and Evacuation of the Morbisick Matter. If there be Signs of abundance of Blood, and the Body being strong, Bleeding is necessary in the beginning. The Body being sufficiently evacuated, both by purging Medicines, and the Loosness it self; astringent and strengthning Medicines are to be given, as well by the Mouth, as injected by Glisters, and applied to the Belly. [Page 243](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/256:5.6?vid=65404) Take of Diascordium grains twenty five, of the compound Powder of Crabs-Claws grains seventeen, of Syrup of Mint a sufficient quantity, mix them, make a Bolus to be repeated upon Occasion. Take of Epidemick-water half an ounce, of Cinnamon-water hordeated three drams, of black-cherry-water, two ounces, of Liquid Laudanum prepared with Juice of Quinces fifteen drops, Syrup of Mint a sufficient quantity; mix them, let the Sick take this Mixture after the Bolus above prescribed, and at Bed-time. Take of Epidemick-water, and of Cinnamon-water hordeated each three ounces; of Mint-water one ounce, of Black Cherry-water five ounces, of Syrup of Mint a sufficient quantity; mingle them, let him take six spoonfuls after the Bolusses. Take of Hartshorn calcin'd two ounces, of Nutmeg four Scruples, of the Roots of Tormentil three drams; boil them in Fountain-water to three Pints, adding towards the end an ounce of White-bread, add to the strained Liquor two ounces of Doctor Stephens's water, and sweeten it with Syrup of Quinces, let him take it for his ordinary Drink. Or, Take of Diascordim three drams, of Cinnamon-water, and simple Angelica-water, each five ounces; infuse them hot in a close Vessel to draw a Tincture, strain it, and add to it fifty drops of Laudanum Cydoniated, and a sufficient quantity of Syrup of Mint; mingle them, let him take two Spoonfuls every Night at bed-time, and in the Day a spoonful after every Stool. Or, Take of London Laudanum three grains, of Doctor Stephens's water, and of Cinnamon-water hordeated each one ounce, of Syrup of Quinces one dram, mingle them, make a Draught, let him take it at bed-time, repeat it at three in the Morning, and at eight in the Morning. [Page 244](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/257:5.6?vid=65404)Take of the Leaves of Mint, the tops of Wormwood each four handfuls; of Zedoary, Galingal, Cyperus, sweet smelling Flag, Nutmeg, sharp Cinnamon, Mace, each half an ounce; of Cubebs, Cloves, each two drams; make two Bags to be boiled in Clarret-wine and Smiths-water, each a quart; press them hot out of the Liquor, and apply them by turns to the Region of the Stomach. Take of Conserve of common Wormwood half an ounce, of old Mithridate Six drams, of Powder of Mastich a sufficient quantity, make a Plaister to be spread on Leather, and to be applied to the Region of the Stomach, you must spread the Margin with Paracelsus's Plaister to make it stick. Or, Take of the Stomach-plaister three drams, of Oyl of Mace by Expression two scruples, of Chymical Oyl of Wormwood, and of Chymical Oyl of Mace, each two drops; mingle them, make a Plaister to be applied to the Stomach. Take of Diascordium six drams, of Venice Treacle two drams boil them in Cows Milk, let eight ounces of the strained Liquor be injected for a Glister, and let it be repeated thrice. Or, Take of the Roots of Tormentil three drams, of Yellow Mirobalans two drams, of Balaustins one dram and an half, of the Flowers of red Roses half an handful, of Rice bruised half an ounce, of Coriander-seeds half an ounce, boil them in a sufficient quantity of Fountain-water, to fourteen ounces, strain it, and make a Glister of half of it, and give the other half four hours after if the loosness continues. [Page 245](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/258:5.6?vid=65404) CHAP. LXXVI. Of the Bloody Flux. SOmetimes it begins with shaking and shivering, and Heat of the whole Body follows, as is usual in Feavers, and soon after the Gripes and Stools; but oftentimes there is no Appearance of a Feaver going before, for the Gripes begin and Stools soon follows; but there are always great Gripes, and a Depression of the Bowels with Pain, when the Patient goes to Stool; the Stools are frequent, with a very troublesome Descent as it were of the Guts, and they are all mucous, not excrementitious, excepting that sometimes an excrementitious Stool comes between, and that is without any great Pain, these mucous Stools are streaked with Blood, yet sometimes there is no Blood at all mixt with them through the whole course of the Disease, yet notwithstanding, if the Stools are frequent with Gripes and a mucous Filth, the Disease may be as properly called a Dysentery, as if Blood flow'd with them. Moreover, The Sick, if he be in the Flower of his Age, or is heated by Cordials, has a Feaver, and his Tongue is covered thick with a kind of whitish Matter; and if he has been much heated 'tis black and dry; the Strength is much dejected, the Spirits are dissipated, and all the Signs of an ill favoured Feaver are present. And this Disease does not only occasion dreadful Pains and Sickness, but, unless it be skilfully managed, it brings the Patient into great Danger of his Life; for when a great many of the Spirits, and a great deal of the vital Heat, have been exhausted by frequent Stools, before the peccant Matter can be cast out of the Blood, his Hands and Feet growing cold, he will be in danger of dying; and if he should escape Death this time, yet many Symptoms of a different kind attend the Poor Wretch. For Instance, Sometimes in the Progress of the Disease, instead of those Sanguineous Filaments which at the beginning us'd to be mixed with the Stools, pure Blood is evacuated unmingled with Slime, and in a larger quantity at every Time which is an Argument that some of the greater Vessels of [Page 246](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/259:5.6?vid=65404) the Intestines are corroded, and so the Patient is in danger of Death: And sometimes also, by reason of the great Burning which is occasioned by a large Flux of hot and sharp Matter to the Parts affected, the Intestines are gangren'd. Moreover, a Thrush at the end of the Disease does very often affect the Mouth and Jaws, especially when the Body has been a long Time heated, and when the Evacuation of the peccant Matter has been hindred by astringent Medicines, the Fomes of the Disease having not been first purged off,; and this is most commonly the forerunner of Death; but if the Patient get over the foresaid Symptoms, and the Disease continues long, at length the Intestines seem to be affected successively downwards, till the Disease be thrust down into the right Gut, and ends in a Tenesmus. But tho this Disease is very often deadly in grown People, but especially to ancient People, yet 'tis very gentle in Children, who sometimes have it some Months, without any Injury, if it be left to Nature. As to the Cure, When I was first called, I bled in the Arm, and at Night I gave an Anodyne, and the next Morning the following lenitive Purge. Take of Tamarinds half an ounce, of the Leaves of Senna two drams, of Rubarb one dram and an half, boil them in a sufficient quantity of Water, in three ounces of the strained Liquor, dissolve of Manna, and of Syrup of Roses solutive, each an ounce; to be taken early in the Morning. And because 'tis very obvious, that purging Medicines, tho they be never so gentle, do heighten the Gripes, and cause a general Disorder and Depression of the Spirits, by the Adventitious Tumult they raise in the Blood and Humours, therefore I usually give an Anodyne after every Purge somewhat earlier than is customary, viz. At any time of the Afternoon if the Purge seem to have done working, whereby I may be able to quiet the Tumult I have raised. I repeat the foresaid Purge twice, to be taken every other Day, and give an Anodyne after every Purge at the Time above mentioned, and I order this to be us'd Morning and Evening when the Patient don't Purge, that [Page 247](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/260:5.6?vid=65404) I may quell the violence of the Symptoms, and gain a Truce while I am evacuating the peccant Humours. The Anodyne I use is chiefly Liquid Laudanum, viz. Sixteen or eighteen Drops of it in any Cordial-water for one Dose. After Bleeding and Purging once used, I allow through the whole course of the Disease, any temperate Cordial to be taken now and then, as Epidemick-water, compound Scordium-water, and the like. For Instance, Take of the Waters of Black-cherries and Strawberries, each four ounces; of Epidemick-water, and compound Scordium water, and of Cinnamon-water hordeated, each one ounce; of prepared Pearls one dram and an half, of Christaline Sugar a sufficient quantity, add half a dram of Damask-rose-water to make it pleasant to the Taste, mingle them, and make a Julep, of which let him take four or five spoonfuls when he is faint, and any other time when he will. I chiefly used these things in ancient and Flegmatick People, that I might somewhat refresh and comfort their Spirits usually dejected in this Disease: their Drink was Milk mixt with three times the quantity of Water, or the white Decoction of Harts-horn, and of white-bread, each two ounces, boyled in three Pints of Fountain-water to two, and sweetned with a sufficient quantity of white Sugar, and sometimes Posset-drink; and when they were very weak, they took for their ordinary drink cold, a quart of Fountain-water boiled with half a Pint of Sack; they were dieted sometimes with Panada, and sometimes with Broths made of lean Mutton. I kept ancient People much in Bed, and permitted them to use more freely any Cordial-water they had been accustomed to, than was fit for Young People and Infants. This Method was the best I have hitherto met with for the Cure of this Disease, which seldom lasted after the third Purge. But if the Disease was obstinate, and did not yield to these things, I prescribed the foresaid Paregorick every day in the Morning and at bed-time, till the Patient was quite well; yea, that it might be the more certainly quelled, I gave the foresaid Laudanum every eighth Hour, and a [Page 248](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/261:5.6?vid=65404) larger Dose than I have mentioned above, viz. twenty five drops, if the former Dose was not sufficient to suppress the Flux. Moreover, I ordered a Glyster made of half a a pint of Cows-milk, and of an ounce and an half of Venice-treacle, to be injected daily, which is exceeding beneficial in all manner of Fluxes of the Belly. Infants seized with this Disease are to be treated after the same manner, but the quantity of Blood to be taken away, and the Doses of the Purging and Anodyne Medicines are to be lessened with respect to their Age, so for example, two drops of the Narcotick may be sufficient for a Child of a Year old. The Liquid Laudanum, which as was said, I daily us'd, was prepared according to this easie Method. Take of Spanish-wine one Pint, Opium two ounces, of Saffron one ounce, of the Powder of Cinnamon, and of Cloves, each one dram; let them be infused together in a Bath for two or three days, till the Liquor come to a due Consistence, strain it, and keep it for use. In the Dry-gripe Dysentery, I used the following Method. If the Patient was in the Flower of his Age, and had a Feaver, I ordered him to be bled in the Arm, and after an hour or two, that he shou'd take great quantities of Liquor, as I us'd to do in the Cholera Morbus, but not Chicken-broth, or Posset-drink, as in that Case, but Whey, which I ordered to be drank cold in the same quantity as in the Cholera; but the Glisters were to be injected warm, without Sugar, or any other thing; I found the Gripes and the bloody Stools went off, with the fourth Glister: This Business being over, and all the Whey ejected (which might be done in the Space of two or three Hours, if the Sick minded his Business) I presently put him to Bed, where he soon sweated of his own Accord (by reason of the Whey mixt with the Blood) and I ordered it should be continued for twenty four hours, but not at all provoked, allowing him all the while nothing but Milk a little warmed, which he only used three or four days after he left his Bed. If either by rising too soon, or by leaving the use of Milk too soon, the Patient relapses, the same Method is to be repeated. [Page 249](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/262:5.6?vid=65404)To conclude, 'Tis to be noted, that tho in those Years wherein the Bloody-flux is Epidemical, the foresaid Evacuations are wholly necessary before we come to the use of Laudanum, yet in any Constitution, not favouring so much this Disease, they may be safely omitted, and the Cure may be performed more compendiously by Laudanum alone in the manner we have described. CHAP. LXXVIII. Of a Tenesmus. A Tenesmus is a continual Motion to go to Stool, whereby nothing but a mucous Matter is evacuated. The Cause of this Disease is an Ulcer of the right Gut, from whence a purulent Matter continually flows, and irritates the expulsive Faculty. It is not dangerous, unless it proceed from black Choler, and so shou'd turn to a Cancer, or should occasion Miscarriage in Women with Child. The manner of Cure is much the same with that of the Bloody-flux. If there be an Inflammation (which is chiefly known by a Feaver) or an abundance of Blood, Bleeding must be us'd; and if the Inflammation remains after Bleeding, and occasion a Strangury (which sometimes happens) Bleeding by Leeches in the Hemorrhoidal Veins is beneficial. Glisters are also to be Injected according to the various Seasons of the Ulcer, sometimes those that are lenient when the Pain is violent, sometimes cleansing, glutinating, or astringent; but in giving Glisters you must observe, first, that they must be given often and in a small quantity, because 'tis difficult to keep them, and then the Pipe must be put up gently, least it should anger the part and cause Pain. And the part must be well fomented and Bathed, and Fumes, Suppositories and Oyntments must be us'd to it; a Fomentation may be made in the following manner. [Page 250](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/263:5.6?vid=65404) Take of the Leaves of Mullein, and Wormwood, each six handfulls; boil them in new Milk, and put them into two Bags, and apply them hot by turns to the Fundament and Belly. Or, Take of the Flowers of Camomil and Roses, each one handful, of red Wine a quart; infuse them for two Hours upon hot Ashes, foment the Fundament as hot as the Patient can bear it with Clothes four times double; afterward let hlm set upon a Spunge pressed out of the same Liquor. Or fill two Bags with wheat-bran, and boil them in Vinegar, let the Sick sit hot upon them by turns, as he can bear them. If much Blood be evacuated, you may make a Fomentation in the following manner. Take of the Leaves and Roots of Mullein two handfuls, of red Roses one Pugil, of the Bark of Pomegranates, and of Gauls, each half an ounce; boil them in two Parts of Smiths Water, and in one of red Wine, 'twill be more powerful if you add half an ounce of Alum. A Bath to ease the Pain must be made of Emollients boyled in a Decoction of Sheeps-feet, and if the Heat be much, Violets, Night-shade, Goards, and pieces of Melons may be added: But to heal the Ulcer, a Bath must be made of Astringents; Fumes are proper to dry the Ulcer, made of Frankincense cast on Coals, or of a Decoction of Savine made with Oxycrate; the following is much commended by Forestus. Take of Mastich one dram, of Frankincense one Scruple, of Mirtles one dram and an half, of red Roses two scruples, make a Fume to be received through a Chair that has a hole at the Bottom. Suppositories do much good in this Case, but they ought to be gentle, least they should exasperate the sensible Part; they may be made of Goats Suet cut into the Form of a Suppository; for it gives Ease and heals the Ulcer; but it will be more powerful to ease the Pain, if you mix with it the Seeds of white Poppies, and of Henbane bruised; [Page 251](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/264:5.6?vid=65404) but tis much better to add, instead of the Seeds, three drops of the Oyls pressed from the Seeds, or a grain of Opium dissolved in half a Scruple of Oyl of Almonds. But to heal the Ulcer, 'tis best to add to the Suet dissolved, Starch, and Gum-tragacanth beat or infused first in Plantane-water; or it may be compounded in the following manner. Take of Gum-Tragacanth as much as is sufficient, pour upon it a little Plantain-water, that it may only swell, and not be too moist; add the Mucilage of the Seeds of Psyllium, or of Quinces a sufficient quantity, and the Yolk of one Egg, mingle them and make them warm; and of melted wax a sufficient quantity, to make Suppositories. Narcoticks may be also added, and the Powders of Ceruss, Tutty, Bole, Balaustines, and other things that dry, and are not acrimonious, when there is a great Corrosion, but they ought to be finely powdered least they should cause Pain. Oyls and Oyntments may be also applied, as Oyntment of Roses, Populeum of the Mucilages, of Yolks of Eggs, and Oyl of Roses, and the like, to asswage the Pain and Inflammation. Lastly, when the Disease is violent, Narcoticks must be used inwardly and outwardly; Laudanum Opiatum is best, whereof three or four grains may be given with Mastich, or sealed Earth, or mixt with a Glister made a Decoction of Camomil Flowers. [Page 252](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/265:5.6?vid=65404) CHAP. LXXIX. Of Worms. THe Worms are generated in various Parts of the Body, yet because that is very seldom, and they most frequently abound in the Guts, therefore we shall treat only of these. The Signs of Worms in the Bowels are various, the following are most frequent and ordinary, a stinking Breath, and Excrements like Cow-dung: There are other Signs, but they are not so common, as a continual Feaver, which has Exacerbations often in a Day, with a cold Sweat, Anxiety, and sometimes with fainting, Nauseousness, Vomiting, and great Thirst; the Pulse are unequal, the Cheeks are red by turns, or wax livid, the Eyes shine, the Nostrils itch, the Teeth gnash, there is a small dry Cough, the Spittle is more than usual, sometimes the Head is heavy, there is a sleepy Disposition, sometimes a Delirium and Convulsive Fits, there is most commonly a pain in the Belly, like a gnawing or Biting, sometimes the Belly swells as in a Dropsie, sometimes the Body wastes beyond Measure, and sometimes there is an insatiable Appetite. The Worms called Ascarides are known by a troublesome itching about the Fundament, and they also often appear upon the Excrements: To conclude, Putrefaction of the Gums is also a Sign. The Cure of Worms is to be directed to the Expulsion of them, by purging Medicines that kill them, and expel the Matter from whence they are generated. Take of calcin'd Harts-horn three grains, of Mercurius dulcis sprinkled with a drop of Oyl of Sulphur by the Bell grains fifteen, of Diagridium grains nine, of Cinnamon grains two, of Spirit of Harts-horn drops three; mingle them, make a Powder to be taken in the Pap of an Apple once a Week. Take of Spirit of Harts-horn half a dram, give ten drops at Bed-time after Purging thrice. Or, [Page 253](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/266:5.6?vid=65404)Take of the Roots of Virginian Snake-weed one Scruple, of Harts-horn calcin'd, and of Coraline, each half a Scruple, mingle them, make a Powder to be divided into three Doses, give one Morning and Evening in a small Draught of the white Decoction. Take of Aloes, and Mirrh each one dram and an half, with a sufficient quantity of Venice-Treacle, and Oyl of Wormwood, make a Plaister for the Region of the Navel. For broad Worms and Ascarides make a Glister of bitter things, with Catharticks, and repeat it often till the impurity from whence the Worms are generated is evacuated. Horatius Augenus mentions an Observation of a Man about twenty six Years of Age, that grew extreamly hungry, so that nothing would allay his Appetite, at length he voided a Worm twenty five Cubits long, and recovered a moderate Appetite; he cured him by the following Medicines, he gave him a pint and an half of fresh Oyl of sweet Almonds divided into four Doses, to be taken a quarter of an hours distance one from another; just before Dinner he gave him two Bolusses made of a dram of Hiera Picra, and one Scruple of Rubarb, and presently after ordered him to take six ounces of a Decoction of Sebestines; and before Supper he injected a Glister made of a quart of Goats-milk, and gave him a dram and an half of the Pill of Aloes not washed. [Page 254](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/267:5.6?vid=65404) CHAP. LXXX. Of an immoderate Flux of the Hemorrhoides, and of the Pain of them. AN immoderate Flux of the Hemorrhoides is very dangerous, and occasions other dangerous Diseases, viz. Weakness of the whole Body, a Consumption, Cachexy and Dropsie. The same Remedies are good for the Cure which were prescribed for Bleeding at the Nose. The Hemorrhoidal Veins ending in the Extremity of the right Gut and Fundament, are often swelled, whereby much Pain is often occasioned. As to the Cure, first Blood must be drawn from the Arm, that Revulsion may be made from the part affected, which being sufficiently peformed, a Vein in the Foot must be opened for Derivation. The Belly must be kept continually open, because hard Excrements; and straining to evacuate them, exasperate the Pain; an Infusion of Cassia taken Morning and Eve is very good to loosen the Belly. Take of the Leaves of Lettice, and Purslain, and the Tops of Mallows, each one handful; of Liquorish rasped and of Raisins of the Sun ston'd each half an ounce; of the flowers of Bugloss and Borrage and of Violets, each one Pugil; boil them to eight ounces, in the strained Liquor dissolve of Cassia fresh extracted one ounce, strain them and clarifie them, and add to them one ounce of Syrup of Violets. In the mean while various Topicks are to be applied to the Part, to asswage the Pain and Inflammation, and to discuss the Tumour, Oyl of sweet Almonds fresh drawn, applyed to the Part eases the Pain, and several Liniments and Oyntments may be prescribed for the same Purpose, whereof some ease the Pain, others dicuss and dry, and others heat the Ulcers; they are to be applyed with Lint or Cotton. [Page 255](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/268:5.6?vid=65404)Take one Yolk of an Egg, of Oyl of Roses, or of Violets, as much as is sufficient; make a Liniment, and if you add to it Populeum Oyntment, 'twill be more effectual to ease Pain, and when the Pain is very violent, a few grains of Opium may be added to it. Or, Take of the Mucilage of the Seeds of Psyllium and of Faenugreek extracted with Wine two drams, of fresh Butter three ounces, of Kid Suet one ounce, stir them together in a Leaden Mortar, make a Liniment. Balsom of Sulphur made of the Flowers of Sulphur and Oyl of Turpentine, is excellent to ease Pain, and to discuss the Swellings, and to cleanse the Ulcers; a white Onion roasted under Ashes, and mixt with fresh Butter like a Cataplasm, eases the Pain, and discusses the Swellings; but if they cannot be easily resolved they must be opened after convenient Revulsions with a Knife, or by Leeches. CHAP. LXXXI. Of the Jaundice. THE Jaundice arises by the Consent of most, from an Obstruction of the Gaul-bladder. As to the Cure, a Vomit at the beginning of the Jaundice whilst the Strength and Tone of the Bowels are firm, does often good. Take of the Infusion of Crocus Metallorum half an ounce or six drams, of Wine of Squils one ounce, of simple Oxymel half an ounce, make a Vomit. Purging Medicines are to be used in this Disease whether it be new or old. [Page 256](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/269:5.6?vid=65404)Take of the Electuary of the Juice of Roses six drams, of Rubarb one dram, of Salt of Wormwood and Cream of Tartar each half a Scruple, with a sufficient quantity of Syrup of Rubarb, make a Purging Bolus to be taken in the Morning. Or, Take of the Pill Ruffi one scruple, of extract of Rudius half a scruple, make four Pills, take them in a Morning, and repeat them four or five Days, afterwards once a Week. Take of Elixir Proprietatis one ounce, let him take twenty Drops in a glass of Wite-wine every day in the Morning, and at five in the Evening. Or, Take of Madder, and Turmerick, each one ounce, of all the greater Celandine, and of the Tops of the lesser Centaury, each one handful; boil them in equal parts of Rhenish-wine, and Fountain-water to a quart; in the strained Liquor dissolve two ounces of the five opening Roots; let him take half a Pint Morning and Evening hot till he is well. Silvius much commends a Decoction of Hemp-seed, and Soap dissolved; our common Remedy is Lice, nine being taken alive in a Morning five or six days following, and I have known several that have been cured this way, when other Medicines would not do the Business. But if, notwithstanding all above mentioned, the Disease continues obstinate, the Sick must use Iron-waters, such as are Tunbridge, which he must drink at the Fountain till he is well. Moreover, Those that are afflicted with this Disease are often subject to Pains that are very troublesome, and they rage chiefly a Nights: And moreover, the Sick cannot rest well, wherefore Anodynes are to be used. Take of Aqua-mirabilis, and of the Water of Worms, each one ounce; of Diacodium six drams, of Tincture of Saffron half an ounce; mingle them. The Dose is one Spoonful or two late at Night when the Sick cannot rest. [Page 257](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/270:5.6?vid=65404) CHAP. LXXXII. Of a Dropsie. EVery Age and Sex are sometimes troubled with a Dropsie, yet Women are more inclined to it than Men, it comes upon Men chiefly when they are old, and upon Women when they have done breeding; but it sometimes seises barren Women when they are young: The pitting of the lower part of the Leg by impression of the Finger, is not so certain Sign of a Dropsie in Women as in Men; for Women that are with Child, and such as have a stoppage of the Courses, are often subject to the same; nor does such a Swelling certainly indicate a Dropsie; for when an old Man of a gross Habit of Body, having been a long while afflicted with an Asthma, is suddenly freed from it in the Winter, presently a great Swelling seises the Legs, yet notwithstanding, generally speaking, the Swelling of the Legs is to be accounted a Sign of an approaching Dropsie. Three Symptoms accompany this Disease, Difficulty of Breathing, little Urine, and great Thirst. There are two sorts of Tumours of the Belly that resemble a Dropsie, that are common to Women; the first is, a preternatural Excrescence of the Flesh in the parts within the Belly, which makes the Belly as Bulky as when Water is included in it; the other kind arises from Wind, which does not only occasion a Tumour, but also other Signs of Breeding; Widdows are most inclined to this sort, or such Women as were not married till they were in Years. The true and genuine curative Indications are wholly to be directed, either to the Evacuation of the Water contained in the Belly and other Parts, or to strengthen the Blood. That Purging may be instituted to the Advantage of the Patient, we ought to know whether the Sick is easily purged or hardly; which can be known no other Way than by Inquiry, how purging Remedies used at other times worked. [Page 258](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/271:5.6?vid=65404)A Dropsie, above all other Diseases, requires the strongest and quickest Purges, and the Sick ought to be purged every day, unless by reason of the Weakness of the Body, or the too violent Operation of the preceding Purge, he ought to rest a day or two; for you must not leave off purging, unless Necessity urge, till all the Water is quite carried off. For those that are easily purged, Syrup of Buck-thorn may be sufficient to carry off the Water. But when the Sick is of such a Constitution, that gentle Catharticks will not work quickly nor easily, stronger must be given; for which I have frequently prescribed the following Potion with Success. Take of Tamarinds half an ounce, of the Leaves of Senna two drams, of Rubarb one dram and an half, boil them in a sufficient quantity of Fountain-water to three ounces; in the strained Liquor dissolve of Manna, and Syrup of Roses solutive, each one ounce; of Syrup of Buck-thorn half an ounce, of the Electuary of the Juice of Roses two drams; mingle them, make a Potion. But this Potion must be given only to strong People; it purges when other things will not, as I have found by frequent experience. Or, Take of White-wine four ounces, of Jalap finely powdered one dram, of Ginger powdered one Scruple, of Syrup of Buck-thorn one ounce; mingle them, make a Potion to to be taken early in the Morning, and to be repeated every Day, or every other Day, according to the Strength. But two Medicines remain, which in my Opinion are better than all the rest, for those that are difficultly purged, I mean Elaterium, and the Infusion of Crocus Metallorum, Elaterium, or the Fecula of wild Cucumbers, being given in a small quantity, purge watery Humours powerfully, for two grains of it are a sufficient Dose for most People; I used to mix it with a scruple of the Pill ex duobus, and to make three small Pills to be taken in the Morning. [Page 259](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/272:5.6?vid=65404)As to the Infusion of Crocus Metallorum, an ounce and an half of it, or two ounces for those that are difficultly vomited, given in a Morning, and repeated daily, according to the Strength of the Sick, though it may seem at first only to evacuate the Water contained in the Stomach, yet at length it will free the Belly from the Waters that are in it. But if the foresaid Vomit does not sufficiently purge the Belly, for it uses to purge at last, after the third or fourth Dose of the Infusion of Crocus Metallorum by it self, I sometimes though rarely, use the following. Take of the Water of Carduus Benedictus three ounces, of the Infusion of Crocus Metallorum one ounce and an half, of Syrup of Buck-thorn half an ounce, of the Electuary of the Juice of Roses two drams; mingle them, make a Potion. But here it is to be noted, that if the Swelling of the Belly be but small, the Water is not so easily evacuated by the Infusion of Crocus Metallorum, as when the Dropsie is great, and a great quantity of Water is heaped up; wherefore unless the Belly be much swelled, it is best to do all by things that purge downwards. But you must take notice that it often happens, that Water is cast not only upon the Thighs and Legs, but also into the Cavity of the Belly, and yet it is not to be evacuated by Purging Medicines. For Instance, When such a Tumour follows a long Consumption, or when it is occasioned by the Putrefaction of some of the Bowels, or from the Tone of the Blood spoiled, and the Spirits exhausted, or by long continuance of Fistula's in Carnous Parts, or occasioned by great Weakness and Evacuations by Sweating, Fluxing, or by violent purging, and by a thin Diet in the Cure of the French Pox, in these Cases the Patient will be rendered worse by purging; wherefore we must endeavour all we can to strengthen the Blood and Bowels: And among Remedies to this purpose, which are to be mentioned by and by, I have found by Experience that the change of the Air, and Exercise in a free Air, such as the Sick can bear, answers this Indication excellently well. [Page 260](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/273:5.6?vid=65404)And when the Sick is of a weakly Constitution, or a Woman subject to Vapours, neither Purge nor Vomits must be used, but you must endeavour to evacuate the Water by Diureticks. I order one pound of the Ashes of Broom to be infused in the cold in three Pints of Rhenish-wine, and that a Pugil or two of the Leaves of common Wormwood be added to it, let the Sick take four ounces of the Liquor filtrated daily in the Morning, at five in the Evening, and late at Night, till the Swelling goes off; with which Remedy alone I have known some Dropsies that were accounted deplorable cured, in such whose weak Constitution could not bear Purging. But to come to the second Intention, half the Business is no more than done, when the Water is evacuated; wherefore we must endeavour to strengthen the Blood by a long and daily Course of heating and strengthening Medicines to prevent a new Collection of Water, and to this end the Sick must drink Wine whilst he is under Cure after the Passages are open for the Water to go out, or instead of Wine strong Beer. For poor People who could not provide better Medicines, I use to order Srong-beer, wherein Horse-radish Root, the Leaves of common Wormwood, Garden Scurvy-grass, Sage, the lesser Centaury, and the Tops of Broom have been infused, for their ordinary Drink. Rich People may use Canary-wine, wherein the same bitter Herbs have been infused, whereof a small draught may be taken twice or thrice a day, or they may take nine spoonfuls of Wormwood-wine instead of it, after two drams of the following Digestive Electuary in the Morning, at four in the Afternoon, and at Bed-time. Take of Conserve of Garden Scurvy-grass one ounce and an half, of the Conserve of Roman Wormwood, and of the yellow Rind of Oranges, each one ounce; of candied Angelica, and Nutmegs candied, each half an ounce, of Venice Treacle three drams, of the compound Powder of Wake-robin, two drams, with a sufficient quantity of Syrup of Oranges, make an Electuary. [Page 261](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/274:5.6?vid=65404)The Sick must be sure to drink sparingly of small Liquors; but to take off his Thirst, he may often wash his Mouth with cold Water sharpened with Spirit of Vitriol, and he may hold Tamarinds in his Mouth now and then, or may chew a Lemon, but he must swallow neither of them. But amongst corroborating things, Steel is not the least. Garlick is also very good; and without any Evacuatious I have known a Dropsie cured by it. Take of Syrup of Steel a quart; let a spoonful be taken with fifteen grains of Cream of Tartar, every Morning, in five spoonfuls of the following Julep. Take of Aqua-lactis Alexiter. one Pint, of compound Water of Wormwood, and of compound Water of Gentian, each three ounces; mingle them, make a Julep. Take of Steel prepared, with Sulphur of astringent Saffron of Mars, each half an ounce; of Crabs-eyes, and red Coral prepared, and of Salt of Wormwood, each one dram; of Volatile Salt of Amber one scruple, of Extract of Gentian a sufficient quantity; mingle them, make ten Pills of every dram, let him take four every Night at Bed-time. 'Tis to be noted, that that Dropsie which only swells the the Legs or the Belly a little, does not presently require to be cured by Vomiting, and Purging; for it's often removed by the heating and strengthning Medicines above mentioned; but above all, 'tis to be minded, that when we undertake to cure this Disease by Corroboratives or Lixivial Medicines, the Patient must by no means be purged. Topical or external Remedies, as far as I have observed do nothing considerable, and Blisters often occasion a Gangrene. To conclude, though this Disease, when it comes to a Dropsie of the Belly, has been always accounted desperate, yet it will appear, that if it be treated according to the Method above described, it may be as certainly cured (if the Bowels are not corrupted) as many other Diseases which are not reckoned so deadly. [Page 262](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/275:5.6?vid=65404) CHAP LXXXIII. Of a Timpany. A Timpany is a fixt hard and equal Swelling of the Belly, that sounds when 'tis knock't upon with the Finger, it proceeds from a Convulsive Inflation of the Bowels, the Animal Spirits being obstructed in the Fibres; it generally ends in a Dropsie. Medicines do little good in this Disease, yet they are not wholly to be rejected, the following are prescribed by Dr. Willis. Take of Peach-flowers, and of Damask-roses, each two pugils; of the Flowers of Broom, Elder, and the lesser Centaury, each one pugil; of the Leaves of Agrimony, and of Sea-wormwood, each one handful; of the best Senna one ounce, of Rubarb six drams, of the seeds of Bastard-saffron half an ounce, of Dwarf-elder two drams, of yellow-sanders three drams, of the Roots of Galingal two drams, cut them, and bruise them, and put them into a silken Bag, and hang them in a Glass-bottle, and pour upon them a quart of White-wine, and a pint of Saxifrage-water, and put into the Bottle, a dram and an half of Salt of Tartar; let them infuse forty eight Hours, and then take four or six ounces every third or fourth Day. The following has been used with Success in this Disease in a hot Constitution. Take of purging-waters four quarts, of Salt of Wormwood two drams, evaporate a quart over a gentle Heat; and to these I used to add of the Water distilled from Wine with Catharticks four ounces, the dose is four or six ounces. Or to the Purging-water evaporated to a quart, add the Roots of Mecoacan, and Tubith, each half an ounce, of Rubarb six drams, of yellow-sanders two drams, [Page 263](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/276:5.6?vid=65404) of Cloves one dram, digest them hot in a close Vessel two hours, filter them hot through Paper, the dose is three or four ounces. Glisters are often used in this Disease, because they loosen the Belly without much provoking the Fibres. Take of the Infusion of Stone-horse-dung, with Camomil-flowers one pint, of Mercurial-honey two ounces, make a Glister. Or, Take of rine one pint, of Sal-prunella one dram, of Venice Turpentine dissolved with the Yolk of an Egg one ounce and an half; mingle them, make a Glister. Diureticks also seem proper. Take of live Millepedes cleansed three ounces, one Nutmeg sliced, beat them together, and pour upon them a Pint of the following Diuretick-water, strain out the Liquor hard, the dose is three or four ounces twice a day. Take of the green-berries of Juniper, and Elder, each six pounds; of the Tops of Fir four pounds, of green Wallnuts two pound, of Winteran Bark four ounces, of the yellow-Peel of six Oranges, and four Lemons, of the Seeds of Bishops-weed, Rocket, and Cresses each one ounce and an half: of Dill two ounces; cut them, and bruise them, and pour upon them four quarts of White-wine Posset-drink, distill them in a common Still, and mingle all the Waters. Whilst these things are taken inwardly, Topicks must be also applied, not such things as are hot and discussing, but those things which are indued with Particles of Volatile Salt and Nitre. Take of the Flowers of Sal-armoniack one ounce, of Sal-prunella two ounces, of small Spirit of Wine a quart, mingle them, and dissolve them in a Bottle. [Page 264](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/277:5.6?vid=65404)Flannels dipt in this are to be applied warm over the Belly twice a day for the space of half an hour; afterwards apply a Cataplasm made of Cows-dung, and the powder of Dogs-dung, or the following Plaister. Take of the Plaister of Sope, that is of the red-lead Plaister, with a sufficient quantity of Venice Sope, spread it thin upon thin Leather, and apply it to the Belly, and renew it within ten or twelve Days. Altering Medicines are also requisite. Take of the Filings of Steel finely powdered two drams, of the distilled Water above described a quart, of the Syrup of the five opening Roots two ounces; mingle them in a Glass, and let them clarifie by standing. The dose is three or four ounces in the Morning, and at five in the Afternoon. Take of the Powder of the Roots of Wake-robin, and of Crabs-eyes, each three drams, of Sal-Prunella two drams, of Vitriol of Mars one dram and an half, of Anthosat Sugar two drams; mingle them, the dose is half a dram in a convenient Vehicle. And Medicines are to be prescribed against Fainting, Difficulty of Breathing, Watching, and Drouth. - Cordials. - Take of the Waters of Orange-flowers, of the Flowers of Marigolds, and of Camomil, each three ounces; of Dr. Stephens's water two ounces, of Tincture of Saffron two drams, of Sugar one ounce, of Pearls one dram, make a Julep, the Dose is four or five spoonfuls thrice, or oftner in a Day. - Take of the Conserve of Marigold-flowers two ounces, of Confection of Atkermes, and of Hyacinth, each two drams; of Pearls powdered one ounce, of the Syrup of the Juice of Citron a sufficient quantity; make a Confection, let him [Page 265](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/278:5.6?vid=65404)take the quantity of a Nutmeg Morning and Evening, drinking upon it a draught of the Julep. - Hypnoticks. - Take of the Hysterick-water six drams, of Diacodium half an ounce, mingle them, let it be taken at Bed-time. Or, - Take of Syrup of Cowslips three Spoonfuls, of compound Peony-water one spoonful, of Laudanum tartarized one dram, let a spoonful be taken in the Night, if the Sick cannot sleep. To quench the Thirst without much drinking, which is always very prejudicial, let the Sick lick often a small quantity of the following Linctus. Take of Conserve of Wood-sorrel pulped three ounces, of the Pulp of Tamarinds two ounces, of Sal-prunella one dram, of the Syrup of the Juice of Wood-sorrel a sufficient quantity; make a Linctus. CHAP. LXXXIV. Of an Anasarca. AN Anasarca is a white soft Swelling of the outward parts of the Body, or of some of them, it yields to the Touch, and will pit, and is occasioned by watry Humours extravasated. As to the Cure, there are two things chiefly to be minded, First, That the Water within the Skin should be evacuated. Secondly, That Care be taken to prevent the heaping up of new Water, to which End we must endeavour (the Viscera of Concoction being freed from Obstructions and Filth) that good Chyle be made and carried in a due quantity to the Mass of Blood, and that it be sufficiently fermented. [Page 266](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/279:5.6?vid=65404)The Vital Indication is of little use in this Disease, because there is seldom Fainting or Watching for which Cordials and Hypnoticks are required, and also a strengthning diet; for Fasting and Abstinence do good in this Case, and often perform the greatest part of the Cure; for the Vessels being emptied by Fasting, absorb the Waters within the Skin or stagnating elsewhere, and evacuate them by the Reins or the Pores of the Skin, or otherwise. The Sick must use purging Medicines prescrib'd for a Dropsie, and the same Diureticks. A Decoction of the Woods is also very proper. Take of the Shavings of Guajacum six ounces, of Sassafras two ounces, of all the Sanders each six drams, of Ivory and Hartshorn rasped each three drams; infuse them, and boil them in four quarts of Fountain-water till half is consumed, adding to it the Roots of Sweet-smelling Flag, of the lesser Galingal, of Burdock, and Butter-bur, each one ounce; of the Leaves of Sharp-sage, and of dried Germander, each two handfuls; keep the strained Liquor for use; the Dose is eight or ten ounces hot twice a Day, to every Dose add twenty or five and twenty drops of Spirit of Saarmoniack, with Amber, or of Soot, or of the Tincture of Salt of Tartar half a dram, or a dram. Frictions do often good in an Anasarca, wherefore the whole Body may be rubb'd once or twice a day with a course Napkin, or with Brushes made for that Purpose. Blisters evacuate the Water plentifully, but there is Danger of a Gangrene by the use of them. But Escharoticks may be more safely used than Blisters; an Emperick often evacuated successfully Water from the Members of Dropsical People, if they were never so much swelled, in the following manner by an Escharotick, viz First, he fomented their Legs Morning and Evening with a Decoction of Dwarf-elder, Wormwood, Camomil, and other hot Herbs, the grounds of Beer or Wine being added to it; and betwixt the times of Bathing he applied a Cataplasm made of the Dregs of the Decoction and Bran; after these things had been used three days, he covered the Legs and Feet with a Plaister [Page 267](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/280:5.6?vid=65404) made of Burgundine-pitch, leaving only upon each Calf a little hole about the bigness of a small Nut, in which places he applied an Escarotick Medicine to the naked Skin, made of the Ashes of the Bark of the Ash, which being taken off, after twelve hours, a small Eschar remained from the pores whereof the Water first drained gently and daily; afterwards it dropt more freely, but when the Eschar cast, it flowed as from a Fountain, till it had emptied the Legs. Another Way remains (as good as the former but less us'd) to drain the Water, viz. By pricking with a Needle, which also must be used cautiously and leisurely, lest the Flux of Waters should be too great; provide such a Needle as Tailors use, and prick the Place that is most swelled with it so as that the Blood may not come; you must prick only six or seven Holes at at a time, at the Distance of the Breadth of a Thumb, one from the other; the Water will break out drop by drop from each Hole continually, till all the Swelling about the Parts prick'd disappears; and then the next time, sometimes after twelve hours, sometimes after eighteen, and sometimes after twenty four, prick again in another part of the same Leg, or in the other; and so once or twice a day in this or that Member, in one or two or more at a time, for the Water may be drawn more plentifully and safer this Way than any other; and if the Breeding of new Water be prevented by Medicines, the Disease will be easily cured. Moreover, in a deplorable Dropsie the Life may be prolonged this way: An old Man of Seventy Years of Age, that was dropsical all over, kept his Head above Water, and lived many Months by this means, contrary to Expectation. But to strengthen and restore the Blood, the following Medicines must be used. Take of Conserve of Sea-wormwood, of Scurvy-grass, and the yellow Peel of Oranges, each two ounces; of the Winteran-Bark two drams, of the Species Diacurcuma one dram and an half, of Steel prepared with Sulphur three drams, of Salt of Wormwood two drams, of Syrup of the Bark of Curon a sufficient quantity, make an Electuary; the Dose is two drams in the Morning, and at five in the Afternoon. [Page 268](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/281:5.6?vid=65404)Chalybeats do often a great deal of good in this Disease. Take of the compound Powder of the Roots of Wake-robin, of the Winteran-bark, each three drams; of the Roots of the lesser Galingal, and of Cubebs, each one dram and an half; of Steel prepared with Sulphur half an ounce, of Sugar anthosated six drams; make a Powder to be divided into twenty Parts, give one Part every Morning, and at five in the Afternoon. Let him drink of the following Decoction instead of Beer. Take of the Shavings of Guajacum, and Sassafras, each four ounces; of the Roots of Florentine-orris, of Sweet-smelling-flag, the lesser Galingal, and of Elecampane, each one ounce and an half; of the Berries of Juniper and Bayes each two ounces; of the Seeds of Annise, Carrawayes, Sweet-fennel, Coriander and Dill, each one ounce; of Long-pepper, and Cubebs, each one ounce and an half; of Cloves, Nutmegs, and Ginger, each half an ounce; of Jamaica Pepper two ounces, of the dried Leaves of Sharp-sage, Wild-sage, Calaminth, Agrimony, each one handful; of Liquorish four ounces, cut them and bruise them, and boil them in four Gallons of Fountain-water till half is consumed, keep the strained Liquor in Bottles for use. Many have been cured by this Liquor. CHAP. LXXXV. Of the Scurvy. IN the old Treatises of Physick, there is so seldom mention made of the Scurvy, and the Description of it is so small, that some have doubted whether such a Disease (that is now Endimial in many Places, and Sporadick almost every where, and wherewith almost every one is affected, or thinks he is so) did at all exist in ancient Times; and some think its Rise is of a newer date, as are the French-pox and Rickets; but this Disease, though it had other Names, was observed by the Ancients, and the Cure of it was described by them, though not very exactly. [Page 269](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/282:5.6?vid=65404)Many and various are the Symptoms of the Scurvy, and sometimes such as are of a contrary Nature, are imputed to it; and if any unusual Accident happens to the Body, that cannot be referred to any other certain kind of Disease, we presently pronounce it Scorbutick. And so this notorious Disease bears the Blame of all, but many truly belong to it which arise in almost every part of the Body, and therefore we will trace it from Head to Foot; it occasions violent, habitual, wandering or periodick Headachs, sometimes a Dulness of the Spirits, and Drowsiness, sometimes Watchings, Giddiness, Convulsions, Palsie, much Spitting, Ulcers of the Gums, Loosness of the Teeth, and a Stinking of the Breath. About the Region of the Breast, Pains in various parts of the Membranes, and especially on the Breast-bone, which are often very violent for many Nights and Days; an Asthma, difficult and unequal Breathing, Constriction and Narrowness of the Breast, a dry Cough, an inordinate Pulse, trembling of the Heart, frequent Fainting, and almost a continual Fear of it. This Disease makes the lower Belly its principal Seat, and occasions many Disorders there, as Nauseousness, Vomiting, Wind, a Cardialgia, frequent Collicks, and troublesome Pains running hither and thither, a Loosness that is almost continual, sometimes a Bloody-flux, a Consumption, and a Dropsie. The Urine is often red, with a Crust upon it, or sticking to the Sides of the Pot, and sometimes 'tis pale and rendred in a great quantity; in the outward Members, and over the whole Body, there are Wandring pains, and oftentimes such as are violent, especially in the Night; also Spontaneous Lassitude, a Wasting of the Flesh, a weakness of the Limbs, Spots of various colours upon the Skin, Tumours, Tubercles, and ill Ulcers, Numbness and Contraction of the Muscels, Twitching of the Tendons, Erratick Feavers, and great Hemorrhagies. These are the common and usual Symptoms of the Scurvy, whereof sometimes more, sometimes fewer, sometimes this kind, sometimes that kind afflict the Sick, and sometimes unusual and prodgious Accidents happen. As to the Cure, Because it is not one simple preternatural Disorder, but a Legion is to be combated with; therefore the Method of Cure consists of many Indications, [Page 270](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/283:5.6?vid=65404) that are variously complicated, but yet they may be referred to these three Heads, viz. They must be preservative to respect the Cause of the Diseases, and curative, that respect the Disease it self and its Symptoms. And Lastly, Vital, which restore and defend the Strength of the Patient. First, The Sick must be purged, and if there be a weight upon the Stomach, a Vomit must be given; and if the Patient be strong and lusty, and used to bear Vomiting well, the Vinum-benedictum may be given, and the like. But if the Sick be of a weakly Constitution; you must give Wine of Squills, or Gilla Theophrasti, and the Sick must fill his Stomach with Posset-drink, and force it up with his Finger, or with a Feather. As to Purging, If the Sick be of a hot Constitution; Medicines of Aloes and Diagridium must be avoided, and such as are made of Senna and Rubarb, must be given, As, Take of the Leavss of Senna one ounce, of Rubarb six drams, of Dodder of Thym three drams, of the Roots of Polypody of the Oak, and of English Rubarb dried, each half an ounce; of yellow Sanders two drams, of Celtick Spike half a dram, of Salt of Wormwood two drams; cut them and bruise them, and infuse them in a Matrass, in the Heat of Sand, with Whitewine and Fumitory-water, each a Pint for two days; evaporate the clear Liquor strained in the gentle heat of a Bath to the Consistence of Hony, then add of the Powder of the Leaves of Senna, and of Rubarb, each one dram and an half; of the Species of the three Sanders one dram, of Cream of Tartar one dram and an half; make a Mass for Pills. The Dose is from half a dram to a dram, to be taken once a Week, or oftner. Or let the Infusion be evaporated to the Consistence of a Syrup, adding towards the end, of Manna strained and of White Sugar, each two ounces; make a Syrup. The Dose is one or two Spoonfuls in a proper Vehicle. They who are of a cold Constitution may take the following Pills. Take of the Stomach-pill with Gums two drams, of Rosin, of Jalap, grains of Tartar vitriolated grains sixteen, of Oyl of Juniper ten drops, with a sufficient [Page 271](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/284:5.6?vid=65404) quantity of Ammoniacum dissolved in the Water of Worms; make sixteen Pills, let four be taken once a Week. Take of the Roots of Sharp-pointed-dock, of Polypody of the Oak, of stinging-nettles, and of Chervil each six drams; of the Leaves of Hemp, Agrimony, and Speedwell, each one handful; of yellow and white Sanders, each one dram; of the Seeds of Bastard saffron one ounce, of White-wine Tartar half an ounce; boil them in a quart of Fountain-water till half is consumed, add a Pint of Rhenish-wine, strain it presently, and add to it half an ounce of the best Senna, six drams of Rubarb, half an ounce of the Leaves of Black-hellebore, of the yellow Peel of Oranges two drams; infuse it warm in a close Vessel twelve hours; keep the strained Liquor in a Glass well stopped; the dose is five or six drams. After Purging once or twice, if Bleeding be indicated, you must bleed in the Arm, or with Leeches. After Bleeding many Remedies of another kind are necessary; but that you may prescribe orderly, you must consider whether the Preservatory Indications have only place here, or whether some curatory Indications, namely such as respect the Symptoms that are violent ought not to be minded between whiles. But if there be no urgent Symptom, you must wholly apply your self to the Cure according to the following Method. And as to the Cure of the Symptoms, we shall treat of them by themselves below. Wherefore, If your chief Design be to erradicate the Cause of the Scurvy, digestive, and Specifick or Antiscorbutick Remedies must be used at all times, except on the Days the Sick purges, whereunto, if there be Occasion, Diaphoreticks or Diureticks must be sometimes added. Various Forms are prescribed by Authors every where to answer these Intensions, but we will only mention the chiefest, which according to the twofold Disposition of the scorbutick Cause, viz. The Sulphurous Saline, and the Salino sulphurean Discrassy of the Blood, we will distinguish, into two Classes; And First, Of the cold Scurvy. Among Digestive Medicines, Cream of Tartar, Salt and Tincture of it, Tartar vitriolated, Elixir Proprietatis, or either of these, may be taken twice a day. Or, [Page 272](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/285:5.6?vid=65404)Take of the Winteran-Bark, of Wood of Aloes, of the Roots of the lesser Galingal, each two drams; of Cinnamon, Cloves, and Cubebs, each one dram; of the Seeds of Bishops Weed, and Cresses, each half a dram; bruise them, and pour upon them the following Menstruum three Fingers high; digest them in a Matrass six days in Sand, keep the strained Liquor in a Glass well stopeed. The dose is twenty drops more or less, in a Spoonful of Canary-wine, or some proper Water twice a Day. The Menstruum is made in the following manner. Take of Spirit of Vitriol rectified six ounces, of Spirit of Wine rectified sixteen ounces; mingle them, and distill it in a glass retort, and Cohobat it thrice, and keep it in a Glass well stopt for use. Elixir Proprietatis is made easier and better by this Menstruum, than by the common way. Whilst these Remedies are given in a small quantity Morning and Evening, Antiscorbutick Medicines of another kind may be taken, which are generally prescribed in a double Form, viz. Solid and Liquid to be taken together, the Solid first, and the Liquid presently after. Take of the Conserves of Scurvy-grass, and Roman Wormwood, and of Fumitory, each two ounces; of the Powder of the Winteran-bark, of the Roots of Angelica, and of Wake-robin, each two drams; of the Species of the three Sanders one dram and an half, of the Powder of Crabs-eyes one dram, of Salt of Wormwood, two drams, with a sufficient quantity of the Syrup of the Bark of Citron; make an Electuary. Take of the Conserves of the Leaves of Scurvy-grass, and Brook-lime, made with an equal quantity of Sugar, each three ounces; of the Troches of Capers, and of Rubarb, each two drams, of Salt of Wormwood, and of Scurvy-grass, each one dram; of Ivory Powdered, and Coral calcined, each one dram; with a sufficient quantity of the Syrup made of the Juice of Scurvy-grass; make an Electuary. I use to prescribe Conserves made of the yellow Peel of Lemons and Oranges, of the Purple-flowers of the Ash, [Page 273](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/286:5.6?vid=65404) of the Leaves and Flowers of Ladies-Smock, of the Roots of sharp-pointed Dock, and of English Rubarb, made with an equal quantity of Sugar, which I give by themselves, or mixed with other Conserves or Species. For Country and poor People, who desire Medicines that are cheap and easily prepared, I prescribe after this manner. Take of the Leaves of Scurvy-grass, and Brook-lime, each four ounces; of white Sugar eight ounces; beat them together in a Mortar, and add to them of the Powder of the Winteran-bark half an ounce, of Tartar calcined with Niter three drams; with a sufficient quantity of Spanish-wine; make an Electuary. The Dose is the quantity of a Wallnut twice a day, drinking upon it some proper Liquor. Take of the Leaves of Scurvy-grass one pound, of Raisins of the Sun stoned, and of White Sugar, each half a pound; of the Lees of the Root of Horse-radish two ounces; beat them together and reduce them to the Form of an Electuary. In some scorbutical cases, where the use of Steel is indicated, three drams of Steel prepared with Sulphur, or two drams of Vitriol of Mars, may be mixed with any of the Electuaries: After the taking of the Medicine once or twice a day the Body must be exercised. Take of the compound Powder of Wake-robin one ounce and an half, of Winteran-bark half an ounce, of Cubebs, grains of Paradise, and Cardamoms, each two drams; of Salt of Wormwood three drams, of Tablets of Oranges three ounces; make a Powder. The dose is one dram in some proper liquor. For Delicate People the following Tablets may be prescribed. Take of the Powder of the Winteran-bark, and of Crabs-eyes, each one dram and an half; of Pearles powdered half a dram, of white-sugar dissolved in a sufficient quantity of the Water of Worms, and boiled to Tablets, six ounces; of Spirit of Scurvy-grass two drams; make Tablets, each weighing half a dram, let two be taken twice a day, drinking upon them some proper Liquor. Tablets of Oranges are made in the following manner. [Page 274](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/287:5.6?vid=65404)Take of Orange, Lemmon, and Citron peel candied, each one ounce; of Eryngo-roots candied half an ounce, of Pine, and Pistach-nuts, each twenty; of sweet Almonds blanched number ten, of Annise-seeds powdered half an ounce; of Ginger candied two drams, of the Species Aromatick Rosat, and of Nutmegs, each one dram and an half; of the Roots of Galingal one dram, of Cloves number ten, of Ambar-grease grains four, of Musk, and Civet, each grains two; of White-sugar dissolved in Rose-water and boiled to Tablets, one pound and an half, and so make Tablets. Antiscorbutick Wines and Beers. Take of the Leaves of Scurvy-grass four handfuls, of Horse-radish-root rasped four ounces, of Winteran-bark bruised half an ounce, of the yellow peel of four Oranges, and as many Lemmons; put them into a glass, and pour upon them six quarts of Rhenish-wine; keep the Glass close stopt in a cold place; let a quarter of a pint be taken Morning and Evening, and at dinner-time daily, and pour off the Wine clear when you use it. But medicated Beer is more common for the Scurvy, to be drank constantly for ordinary Drink. Provide four Gallons of Ale, and instead of Hops, boil in it four handfuls of the tops of Pine, or of Fir; when it has done Working in the Vessels, put in four handfuls of Scurvy-grass, four ounces of the Roots of Sharp-pointed Dack, and the Peels of four Oranges; when it has stood a Week and is clear, it may be drank for ordinary Drink. Diet-drinks do a great deal of good in the Scurvy, because they being continually taken with Meat they alter the Blood. But in some Scorbutical cases, and in a hot Scurvy, Scurvy-grass, Horse-radish, and the Winteran-bark, and other acrid things, such as abound with Volatile-salt are sometimes injurious; wherefore when the Morbisick Discrasie of the Blood is hot, temperate Medicines are indicated. Take of Conserves of Brook-lime, and Ladies-Smock, made with an equal quantity of Sugar, each three ounces; of the Species of the three Sanders, of Diarrhodon Abbatis, each one dram and an half; of Ivory powdered one dram, of Pearls half a dram, of Salt of Wormwood, and Tamarisck, [Page 275](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/288:5.6?vid=65404) each one dram; with a sufficient quantity of Syrup of Coral, make an Electuary Take of the Conserves of Wood-sorrel, and of Hips, each three ounces; or of the Conserve of the Roots of Sharp-pointed Dock, and of the Roots of Succory, each three ounces; of the Troches of Rubarb two drams, of the Species Diamargarite frigid one dram and an half, of the Bark of Tamarisck one dram, of Sal-prunella one dram and an half, of Mirobalans candied number two, with a sufficient quantity of the Syrup of candied Mirobalans; meke an Electuary. For the Poor I used to prescribe the following Electuary. Take of the Leaves of Brook-lime six ounces, of Wood-sorrel two ounces, of White-sugar eight ounces; bruise them, and add to them half an ounce of the Flower of the Seeds of sweet Fennel, of Ivory powdered two drams, of Sal-prunuella one dram and an half, with a sufficient quantity of the Syrup of the Juice of Brook-lime; make an Electuary. Take of the Powder of the Leaves of Ground-pine, of the compound Powder of Wake-robin, each one ounce and an half; of Ivory powdered, and of red Coral, prepared with the Juice of Oranges, each two drams; of the Tablet of of Oranges two ounces. The Dose is one Spoonful twice a Day, Take of the Species of the three Sanders, of Diamargarite frigid, each one dram and an half; of Pearls powdered, Red-coral prepared, and of Ivory powdered, each one dram; of Sugar dissolved in Scordium-water, and boiled to Tablets, six ounces; make Tablets. But if Chalybeats are to be mixed with these temperate Antiscorbuticks, two or three drams of Crocus Martis, or the like, may be added to the Electuaries: But it is often best to take Calybeats in Liquors. Wines and mediated Beers. Although the use of Wines in the Scurvy, caused by reason of the Heat, and sulpherous Saline Discrasie of the Blood, are not very convenient; nevertheless when the Weakness of the Stomach, or Custom at least requires Wine mixed it with Water. Such a Liquor that is temperated and medicated may be prepared. In the first place, Small Wines, mixed with [Page 276](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/289:5.6?vid=65404) Water, and those that are impregnated with the Infusion of Baulm, Borrage, and Burnet, may be allowed. Moreover, Wines may be prepared of the Juice of Currants, of Cherries and of Garden-fruits, which may be ripened by Fermentation, and are very grateful to the Stomach, and purifie the Blood: Syder is also very good, if it be clear, and not sharp. Moreover, many ingredients may be put into clear Syder, as the Tops of Pine or of Fir, the Flowers of Tamarisck, the Raspings of Ivory or Hartshorn, which sweeten and preserve the Liquor. Temperate medicated Diet-drinks may be prescribed in the following Manner. Provide six Gallons of Small Ale, and instead of Hops, boil the Tops of Pine or Tamarisck in it, or the Raspings of the Wood of either of them; and when it has done working; put into a Bag sharp-pointed Dock dried, which is an excellent Medicine for the Scurvy; also the Leaves of Water-cresses, or Brook-lime, and Bank-cresses; also Citrons, or Oranges cut in Slices, and hanged in Vessels. Hitherto we have treated about the Removal of the Morbisick cause, but when the Symptoms are very violent, they require a peculiar Method of Cure. And First, Difficulty of Breathing, with Narrowness of the Breast, and Asthmatical Fits, must be taken off by Medicines proper for the Symptom: Elixir Proprietatis is of excellent use in this Case. Pain of the Stomach, Nauseousness, Belching and Vomiting, must be cured by a gentle Vomit of Wine of Squils, or of Salt of Vitriol; or the Patient must be purged with an Infusion of Rubarb, with Salt or Cream of Tartar added to it. Elixir Proprietatis is also good in this Case. The Collick and Gripes must be cured by Glisters, Opiats and testaceous Powders. Take of the Powder of Crabs-eyes, and of Egg-shells, each one dram and an half; of Pearls, one dram; make a Powder to be divided into twelve Doses, whereof one must be taken every sixth hour in some Antiscorbutical-water. And in this case Epsom and Barnet-waters do a great deal of Good. An inveterate Diarrhea which frequently happens to Scorbutical People, must not be stopt by astringent Medicines, nor is it easily cured by Alteratives and Antiscorbuticks. [Page 277](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/290:5.6?vid=65404)Tunbridge-waters and the like are of excellent use in this case. Chalybeat Medicines are also very good, but Crocus Martis is the best. I have used the following Method often with very good Success. First, The Sick must be purged with the Powder or Infusion of Rubarb, with some astringent Aromaticks added to it; and it must be repeated three or four days after. On the days the Sick does not purge, he must take Morning and Evening the quantity of a Nutmeg of the following Electuary. Take of the Conserve of Roman-wormwood, made with an equal quantity of Sugar, six ounces (in a hot Constitution Conserve of Roses may be used instead of it) of Diarrhodon Abbatis two drams, of white and red Sanders powdered, each one dram; of the best Saffron of Mars half an ounce, with a sufficient quantity of Syrup of Steel; make an Electuary. In a Bloody-flux and Tenesmus, the like Method is to be used, especially Tunbridge-waters or the like. Moreover, Glisters made of Vulnerary Decoctions must be often injected. I lately cured a Man of a long Disentery who daily voided many Ounces of Blood by the following Remedy. Take of the best Rubarb powdered two drams, of Cinnamon one dram, of Crocus Martis three drams; make Pills with a sufficient quantity of Lucatellus's Balsam. He took four sometimes every day, sometimes every other day, for the space of a Fortnight, and was perfectly cured. But he constantly drank a medicated Beer made of the Roots of Sharp-pointed Docks, and of the Leaves of Brook-lime. A Vertigo often comes upon an inveterate Scurvy; as also frequent Swoonings, and Numbness in the Limbs; they are very difficultly cured, by reason they are produced by a Scorbutick Salt obstructing the Brain and Nerves. Cephalick Medicines, such as are proper in the Vertigo and Paralitick Distempers, which come of themselves, mixed with Antiscorbuticks, are to be given. Therefore the Body being cleansed by Catharticks which are proper in the Scurvy, you may proceed with Medicines proper to cure these Diseases after this manner. In the beginning of the Cure the Hemorrhoids are to be opened by the Application of Leeches; and this ought to be often repeated, unless something contraindicate. [Page 278](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/291:5.6?vid=65404) Take of the Roots of Male-peony half an ounce, of red Cora prepared two drams, of Man's Skull, and Elks-hoof, each one dram; take of fine Sugar dissolved in Peony-water compound, or the compound Water of Horse-radish, and boiled to Tablets, eight ounces; of the best Oyl of Amba rectified half a dram; make Tablets. A dram and an half or two drams of them may be taken Morning and Night, drinking upon them a draught of the following distilled water. Take of the Leaves of Scurvy-grass, Brook-lime, Lillies of the Valley, Sage, Rosemary, Bettony, each three handful, of green Wallnuts one pound, the Peels of six Oranges and of four Lemmons, the Roots of Male-peony green Pound and an half; after they are bruised and sliced, pour upon them of Flegm of Vitriol one pound, of Who made with Syder five Pints; distil them after the common manner; mix all the Liquor together. The Dose is three or four ounces. Fluxes of Blood often threaten great Danger in the Scurvy; therefore these Fluxes, whether they be too great, or from an inconvenient place, ought to be stop for the present, and guarded against for the future. The common Method of stopping Blood when it flows immoderately, is generally known, and there is no peculiar thing more to be done on this Occasion, than what is usual in other Fluxes of Blood. Nevertheless, to hinder these Fluxes of blood, Remedies must be used which sweeten the Blood, and contract the Orifices of the Vessels which are too lax and open. Both these Intentions are excellently performed by Steel Medicines. Take of the Conserve of red Roses, and of Hips, each three ounces; of the Species Diarrhodon Abbatis, of the three Sanders, each a dram and an half; of Salt of Steel one dram, of Saffron of Mars two drams, of red Cora prepared one dram and an half, with a sufficient quantity of Syrup of Steel; make an Electuary. The Dose is the quantity of a Nutmeg three times a day, drinking upon it a Draught of some proper Liquor. For the Poor you may prescribe after this manner. Take of the Tops of Cypress, and of stinging Nettles, each four ounces; of Brook-lime two ounces; beat them in a Mortar with ten ounces of white Sugar; afterwards add [Page 279](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/292:5.6?vid=65404) Filings of Steel finely powdered one ounce, of white and red Sanders powdered, each two drams; with a sufficient quantity of Syrup made of the Juice of Nettles, make an Electuary. The Dose is the quantity of a Wallnut twice a day. When the Scurvy does infect the inward Parts of the Mouth, as when the Gums begin to swell, and their Flesh grows spungy, Medicines are presently to be used that resist Putrefaction: Liquors to wash the Mouth, and Liniments are of great use both at the beginning and height of this Distemper; and as they respect various Intentions, so they are to be prepared after divers manners. Gargarisms or Waters for the Mouth are of divers kinds, which are all made for the most part of the Decoctions of Vegetables, or the Infusion of Minerals. The Herbs and Roots which are boiled in a proper Liquor, viz. Water, or Wine, are for the most part sharp, bitter, or stiptick. Afterwards these Decoctions are impregnated with a Salt either volatile, lixivial, vitriolick, or chalybeat and aluminous. When the Gums are swelled, and become spungy, a Gargarism may be prescribed after this manner. Take of the Bark of Elder, and of Elm, each half an handful; of the leaves of Savory, Sage, Hedge-mustard, and Cresses, each one handful; of the Roots of Pepper-wort two drams. After they are cut and bruised, boil them in three pints of Lime-water to the Consumption of the third part; make a Gargarism; it may be sweetned with two ounces of Honey of Roses. Liniments may be also prescribed for the same purpose, they are most properly applied at Night. The following is greatly commended by Authors. Take of the Powder of the Leaves of Columbines, of curled Mint, Sage, Nutmeg, Mirrh (which is sometimes left out) each two drams; of Burnt-alum half an ounce, of Virgin-honey a sufficient quantity; make a Liniment. If the Flesh of the Gums be dried, and falls off from the Roots of the Teeth, light Scarification is often used; the Mouth also is to be washed with this Decoction. Take of the Tops of Madder, Cypress, of the Leaves of Sanicle, Ladies-smock, each one handful; boil them in three pints of Water wherein hot Iron hath been quenched, [Page 280](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/293:5.6?vid=65404) to the Consumption of a third part; add to the strained Liquor two ounces of Honey of Roses; mingle them. When the Gums are putrified and corrupted, and the Teeth being carious and loose, stink, stronger Medicines, and such as greatly resist Putrefaction, are to be used. The Infusion of Vitriol camphorated, and of Lapis medicamentosus, is very effectual in this case. If deep and putrid Ulcers afflict the Gums, or any other part of the Mouth, strong Remedies must be often used; also Cotton dipt in Aegyptiacum dissoloved in Spirit, or in the Infusion of Lapis Medicamentosus, or sublimate, must be sometimes applied to the part affected. Scorbutick People are also oftentimes afflicted with Pains in the Legs and in other Joints, especially in the Night-time, for the removing of which Pains, which are sometimes very violent, besides the general Method of curing the Scurvy, Specifick Remedies are to be used: Therefore in such a case Purging having been rightly performed, and Bleeding, if there be occasion for it, Medicines both external and internal must be used. As to the First, Those that evacuate by Sweat, and by Urine, are oft-times very effectual: Testaceous Powders, Crabs-eyes, the Jaw of a Pike, the Spirit, and Flowers of Sal-Armoniack, Spirit of Blood, Tincture of Antimony, and of Coral, Decoctions of the Roots and Seeds of Burdock, Ground-pine, and Germander, are very proper; and such like Remedies may be taken twice or thrice a day n distilled antiscorbutick-waters. The distilled water of Horse-dung, with Scurvy-grass, Brook-lime, and Ground-ine, and the like, may be conveniently used. In the mean time Fomentations, Liniments, Cataplasms, and uch like Applications must be applied to ease the Pain. For a Scorbutical Gout, Henricus Petreus mentions wo Remedies, which are frequently used in Westhalia. Take nine Worms, beat them in a Mortar with two spoonfuls of Wine, press it through a Cloth, and add to it half a Measure of Wine; let three spoonfuls of it be taken in the Morning, at Noon, and in the Evening for many days. The other is as follows. [Page 281](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/294:5.6?vid=65404)Take of Savin two or three Branches, of Virgin-honey two spoonfuls, boil them in a measure of Wine till the Wine sink two Fingers; let four or five spoonfuls of the strained Liquor be taken thrice a day. Certainly the Magisterial-water, of Worms, of the London Dispensatory, is very beneficial in this Disease, so are the Spirit and Salt of Harts-horn, Spirit of Blood, Flowers of Sal-armoniack, which I have often used with good Success. Moreover, Testaceous Powders, as Crabs-eyes, Coral, Pearls, and Vegetables, which are counted good for the Gout, as the Roots of Birth-wort, the Leaves of Ground-pine, and Germander, and the like, mixed with Antiscorbuticks conduce to the Cure of this Disease. Oyl of Worms, of Frogs and Toads, are often useful to ease the Pain. I have been told by a worthy Man, that the Water drawn from what is contained in the Stomach of an Ox newly killed, by Distillation, and applied hot with Cloaths, gives certainly ease. For Convulsive and Paralitick Diseases occasioned by the Scurvy, Remedies proper for them must be mixed with Antiscorbuticks, For a Consumption and a Feaver ocasioned by the Scurvy, gentle Catharticks, Digestives, and things that corroborate must be used. And because they often arise from a scirrhous Tumour in the Stomach, or Parts thereabouts, things that open Obstructions are to be used, as Tunbridge-waters, and the like. Moreover, Fomentations, Liniments and Plaisters must be outwardly applyed; Asses or Cows-milk, diluted with Barly-water, or with some proper distilled-water is often good; so is Broth made of Snails, and Snails boiled in Milk. Moreover, Distilled waters of Milk or Whey with Snails, and Antiscorbutick Herbs, do a great deal of Good in this Case. And for the Feaver, the following Medicines may be used with a thin Diet, Take of the Raspings of Harts-horn, and Ivory, each two drams and an half; of Eryngo Roots candied six drams, of the Roots of Chervil, Dandelyon, each half an ounce; of the Leaves of Harts-tongue, Liverwort, each one handful; one Apple sliced, of Raisins one handful; boil them in four Pints of Fountain-water to the Consumption of a [Page 282](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/295:5.6?vid=65404) third part; pour the strained Liquor upon two handfuls of Brook-lime, and a dram and an half of Sal-prunella, or of Nitre fixed one dram; let them infuse for the Space of three Hours; four or six ounces of it may be taken three times a day. Take of the Leaves of Brook-lime four handfuls, of Wood-sorrel, of the Herb and Root of Dandelyon, each two handfuls; of Snails cleansed one pound and an half, the Peels of two Oranges: After they are bruised and cut, pour upon them six Pints of new Milk, or Whey made with Syder, or of the fresh Juice of Apples; distill them after the common Way. Three ounces may be taken twice or thrice a day. A Scorbutical Rhumatism must be cured by Purging, but especially by Bleeding, and repeated sometimes according to the Strength of the Patient. Diureticks and Diaphoreticks must be also used, and four or six ounces of the Infusion of Horse-dung in Wine or Ale may be taken twice or thrice a day on the Days the Sick does not purge. Spirit of Harts-horn, or of Blood, is also very good in this case. A Scorbutical Dropsie arising from an evident Cause, or occasionally, is often cured; wherefore, if the Sick cannot sleep, Opiats must be given, and Purging must be repeated at due distances, according to the Strength of the Patient, and Glisters must be often injected to keep the Body loose. Take of Mercurius Dulcis one Scruple, of Rosin of Jalap five or ten grains, of Cloves half a Scruple; mix them and give it in a spoonful of Panado: At other Times Diureticks, and sometimes Diaphoreticks, must be given. Take of Tincture of Salt of Tartar, impregnated with the Tincture of Millepedes, as much as you please: Give a Scruple or two Scruples twice a day in some proper Liquor. Take of the Spirit of Sal-armoniack what quantity you please: The Dose is fifteen drops. Take of Mille pedes prepared three drams, of Salt of Tartar two drams, of Nutmegs one dram; mix them, make a Powder. The Dose is half a dram twice a day with some proper Liquor. Or, [Page 283](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/296:5.6?vid=65404)Take of dried Bees powdered two drams, of the Seeds of Bishops-weed powdered one dram, of Oyl of Juniper one scruple, of Turpentine a sufficient quantity for a Mass of Pills. The Dose is one scruple or half a dram to be taken twice a day, drinking upon it three or four ounces of the following Water. Take of the Leaves of both the Scurvy-grasses, of Water-cresses, of Pepper-wort, and Arsmart, each three handfuls; of the Roots of Wake-robin, Briony, and Florentine-orris, each four ounces; of the middle Bark of Elder two handfuls, of the Winteran-bark two ounces, of the yellow Peel of four Oranges, and three Lemmons, and of fresh Juniper-berries, four ounces; cut them and bruise them, and pour upon them two quarts of Rhenish-wine, and of the Wine made of the Juice of Elder-berries one quart. Distill them in a common Still, and mix the Waters. The Dose is three or four ounces twice a day, after a Dose of any of the Medicines above prescribed. There remains one Symptom, that comes, though rarely, upon the Scurvy, viz. A crackling of the Bones; but the Cure of it is not yet known. An orderly Diet is of great moment in the Cure of the Scurvy: The Sick must only eat Meat of easy Digestion, he must avoid thick and clammy Meat, and such as are smoaked, and Pulse, Milk-meats, unripe Fruit, and things that are sugared; for the Scurvy has increased wonderfully of late by the immoderate use of Sugar. Their Drink must be middling mild Beer, that is clear and medicated with Antiscorbuticks. Exercise and Labour are so beneficial in the Scurvy, that many have been cured by them alone. An Air moderately hot and dry, thin and pure, should be chosen. [Page 284](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/297:5.6?vid=65404) CHAP. LXXXV. Of the Stone in the Kidneys, and of the Nephritick Pain. THE Nephritick Pain is called that whick afflicts the Reins and Ureters: The cause of this Pain is various; but the most frequent is a Stone or gross Flegm. The less frequent causes are Clods of Blood thrust into the Ureters, or thick Matter, conveyed from the Reins or other Parts into the Ureters. The diagnostick Signs of the Stone. The first Sign is a fixed Pain about the Region of the Loins; the second is bloody Urine; the third thin and little Water at the Beginning of the Fit, which is sometimes succeeded by a total Suppression of Urine, if both the Ureters be obstructed; the fourth is, the frequent voiding of Sand and little Stones; the fifth is, a Numbness of the Legs; the Sixth is, the drawing up of the Stones; the seventh is, Nauseousness and Vomiting. The Cure of the Nephritick Pain, and Stone sticking in the Reins and Ureters, is peformed by dilating the Passages, by the Explosion of the Stone, or any other Matter which causes Pain; and also by removing the antecedent Cause, and mitigating the Pain, to the which Indications the following Remedies answer. Take of the carminative Decoction for a Glister ten ounces, of the Electuary of Laurel-berries, of the Electuary of Juice of Roses, each three drams; of Venice-turpentine dissolved in the Yolk of an Egg six drams, Oyl of Saint Johns-wort ten drams; mingle them, make a Glister, After the Glister hath done Working, a Vein may be opened in the Arm. It is diligently to be observed, that Purging Medicines are not to be given until the pain be somewhat abated, notwithstanding a Vomit may be proper at that time, Take of Salt of Vitriol two Scruples; it may be taken in a draught of Posset-drink with Regiment. [Page 285](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/298:5.6?vid=65404)Those Medicines are to be taken at the Mouth that dilate the Passages and mitigate the Pain. Take of White-wine, compound-water of Horse-radish, each one ounce and an half, of the Juice of Lemmons one spoonful and an half, of Tartar vitriolated one scruple, Oyl of sweet Almonds one ounce, Syrup of Marshmallows two ounces, Powder of Nutmeg one scruple; make a draught, let it be taken warm. Take of the Decoction of the Syrup of Marshmallows two Pints, sweeten it with Syrup of Water-lillies and Marshmallows; add to it six ounces of White-wine; a large draught of it may be taken warm. When the Pain is very violent Narcoticks must be used. Take of the Waters of Pellitory of the Wall, Saxifrage, and Cowslips, each one ounce; Syrup of Poppies six drams, London Laudanum one grain; mix them, make a draught to be taken at bed-time. Take of Mathews's Pill half a Scruple, of Turpentine half a dram; mix them, make four Pills to be taken at Bed-time. But because a great quantity of crude Humours ordinarily accompanies this Disease, some purging Medicine must be given. Take of whole Cassia half an ounce, boil it in a sufficient quantity of the Decoction of Senna Geronis, to three ounces of the strained Liquor, add of choice Manna one ounce; mingle them, make a Draught to be taken with Regiment. Or, Take of choice Manna two ounces, dissolve it in four ounces of Milk-water, add to the strained Liquor two scruples of Cream of Tartar. Anoint well with a warm Hand the Region of the Kidneys and Ureters, with the Oyntment of Marshmallows, and Oyl of Scorpions of Mathiolus. The following Medicines are often used. Take of Turpentine of Chios two drams, of Balsam of Tolu half a dram, with a sufficient quantity of Troches of Alkakengi, make middling Pills, let four of them be taken at Bed-time. Take of the Powders of Crabs-eyes, and of Millepedes, each two Scruples; of the Seeds of Daucus powdered, and of [Page 286](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/299:5.6?vid=65404) Sal-prunella, each one scruple; make a Powder to be divided into four Parts, let one be taken at Bed-time. To prevent this Disease, Tunbridge-waters, and the like, and Whey, drank for the Space of a Month in the Spring are good. In the use of all Diureticks, this is perpetually to be observed, viz. They must not be frequently given. The immoderate Heat of the Reigns may be qualified by wearing continually upon them Plates of Lead with holes in them. CHAP. LXXXVII. Of the Stone in the Bladder. IT is very difficult to know this Disease, especially at the beginning, when the Stone is small; but when it is great it is easily known. The first Sign is, a pain in the Neck of the Bladder, which is exasperated about the end of making Water, and stretches it self to the Glans; it is very like a Heat of Urine, and can scarce be distinguished from it at first, till other Signs begin to appear. The second Sign is, an itching on the Yard, which forces the Sick to handle and scratch it often. The Third Sign is, a Weight in the Peritonaeum, and in all the Region of the Pubis, with a heavy Pain; this is when the Stone is large. The fourth Sign, when the Stone is large, there is a great Difficulty in making Water; the Sick endeavours to make Water often, but renders it by drops. The sixth Sign is, a Suppression of Urine in making Water, when it stops suddenly in the middle Course, the Stone being brought with the Urine to the Neck of the Bladder. The sixth Sign is, the voiding Urine most easily upon lying on the Back, because the Stone in that Position goes farthest from the Channel of the Bladder; also when the Urine, being suppressed in making Water, flows freely; [Page 287](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/300:5.6?vid=65404) when the Body is laid back and shook, the Stone falling then to the bottom of the Bladder. The seventh Sign is, frequent Erection of the Penis, which prooceeds from a retention of the Urine, and from an Inflammation of the Bladder occasioned by the rubbing of the Stone. The eighth Sign is, a Tenesmus, and a frequent Endeavour to go to Stool, which follows the Endeavours of making Water, by reason of the consent betwixt the Sphincter of the Anus, and the Bladder; and the one being irritated, the other is so too, because they receive Branches from the same Nerve. The ninth Sign is, that the Sick cannot rest in one place, they move their Legs alternately; and if the Stone be large, he can scarce stand upright, or ride or walk in stony places. The tenth Sign is, that the Sick are eased by no Remedies, but most commonly grow worse thereby, because all Medicines that come to the Urinary Passages increase the Disease, either by bringing new matter to the Bladder, or they rub off the Flegm which encompasseth the Stone, and then it grates harder upon the Bladder. The eleventh Sign is, that when the Sick has been subject to Nephritick Pains, and used to void Gravel at the end of the Fit. If after such Pain he has not voided a Stone as he was wont, it is a Sign that the Stone remains in the Bladder, and increases by degrees, and occasions the foresaid Symptoms. The Cure is much the same with that described in the foregoing Chapter; when the Stone is small, Water distil'd from Onyons being used for forty days, has evacuated a Stone of the bigness of a Bean: But daily Experience shews, that a Stone cannot be dissolved in the Bladder by any Medicines; wherefore we are generally forced to leave such Patients to the Lithotomist; and having been intimately acquainted with one of the chiefest Lithotomists in the City of London, and made some Observations upon his Practice; I find that Children bear cutting well, and generally recover; but that Men past forty Years of Age, most commonly die. [Page 288](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/301:5.6?vid=65404)If the Sick will not undergo Cutting, or if it be not safe, by reason of his Age, gentle Medicines must be used, such as are prescribed for Heat of Urine, least the Stone should ulcerate the Neck of the Bladder by its Roughness, upon which it is often rolled; and if it happen to be thrust upon the Neck of the Bladder, and so stop the Urine, the Patient must lie upon his Back, and you must endeavour to remove it by shaking the Body and lifting up the Legs; afterwards you must use an emollient Fomentation or Bath, and you must force back the Stone with a Catheter. CHAP. LXXXVIII. Of an Inflammation of the Reins and Bladder. BEcause an Inflammation of the Reins and Bladder is cured by the same Remedies; therefore we include them both in one Chapter, The Signs of an Inflammation of the Reins are, a heavy Pain in the Region of the Reins, and there is sometimes a pulsation: If the place wherein the Arteries are be affected, and the Pain is extended to the neighbouring Parts, so that the Sick cannot raise himself upright nor stand, and but difficultly turn himself to the opposite side, neither can he lie upon that side nor upon his Belly, and therefore he is forced perpetually to lie upon his Back; if his Knees, or if his Body be any way moved, the Pain is much exasperated; there is a Numbness of the same side, by reason of a Nerve which goes from thence to the Leg; his Urine is hot, and in the beginning thin and yellow; afterwards red and thick. The Sick has a continual and acute Feaver, and it is often accompanied with watchings, a Delirium, Nauseousness and Vomiting. But in an Inflammation of the Bladder, the Pain is seated upon the Region of the Pubis, and Perinaeum, in which Parts there is a Heat, and sometimes an apparent Redness, the Urine is always hot, and voided difficultly, the Passage being stopt by the Tumour; and the right Gut is affected by reason of its Nearness; upon which account [Page 289](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/302:5.6?vid=65404) there is frequent endeavours to go to stool, and sometimes the Belly is bound: There are also other Symptoms that are common with the Inflammation of the Reins, as a Feaver, watching, and the like. The Cure of an Inflammation in the Reins and Bladder, is performed by Medicines that cause Revulsion and Derivation, and by such as cool and moderately repel, by Anodyn, resolving and suppurating Medicines. And First, Bleeding is very necessary twice, thrice, or oftener, acccording to the Strength, until the Fluxion is stopped and the Pain abated. A large quantity of Blood being taken away from the upper Veins, the lower are to be opened also in the Foot to make Derivation. The Hemorrhoidal Veins are also to be opened, especially if they are swelled; and Cupping-glasses with Scarification are to be applied to the upper and lower parts to make Revulsion. Frictions and painful Ligatures of the extream parts are also to be used; Emollient cooling, and moderately loosning Glisters must be injected in a small quantity. Take of the Roots of Marsh-mallows one ounce, of the Leaves of Mallows, Violets, and Lettice, each one handful; of sweet Prunes four pair, of Barley cleansed, and of the Flowers of Violets, each one Pugil; make a Decoction to eight or ten ounces; in the strained Liquor dissolve one ounce of Cassia, of Oyl of Violets four ounces, of Yolks of Eggs number two, make a Glister. The Heat of the Blood must be mitigated by Juleps and Emulsions. Take of the Waters of Endive, Lettice and Purslain, each four ounces; of Syrup of Pomegranates two ounces, of Syrup of Water-lillies one ounce; mingle them, make a Julep, for three Doses to be taken Morning or Evening. Or, Take of the Roots of Sorrel two ounces, of the Leaves of Mallows, Plantane, Purslain, and Endive, each one handful; of the Tops of white Poppies half an handful, of the Seeds of Annise and Lettice, each one dram; of the Flowers of Borrage, Violets, and Water-lillies, each one pugil; boil them to a Pint and an half; then add of the Syrup of Pomegranates four ounces. Or, Take of sweet Almonds blanced one ounce, of fresh Pine-nuts half an ounce, of the Seeds of Lettice, Sorrel, Purslain, and white Poppies, each three drams; beat them in a [Page 290](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/303:5.6?vid=65404) marble Mortar, and pour upon them of the Waters of Barley, or Lettice, or Purslain one Pint and an half; in the strained Liquor dissolve one ounce of Sugar of Roses; make an Emulsion for three Doses. Syrup of Poppies may be conveniently added to this Emulsion, to restrain the Fluxion more powerfully. Cooling Glisters must be also injected. In the Beginning of these Inflammations, Purging is not convenient, but at the Declination gentle Purges may be used, as of Manna, Cassia, Rubarb, Tamarinds and the like. But cooling and moderately repelling Medicines must be used outwardly at the beginning, as liquid Epithems made of the Waters or Juices of Plantane, Sorrel, Endive, Night-shade, and of Roses, with a little Vinegar, red Sanders, and Camphor; also Liniments of Oyl of Roses Omphacine, and of Violets, the white Oyntment, or Populeon alone, or mixed, a little Vinegar being added to them, may be applied almost cold to the Parts every hour. If the Pain be very violent, it will not be improper to add to the Epithem or Liniment, a little Opium or Saffron. A Cataplasm may be also made of Barley-meal, with the Juice of Endive, Purslain, and Night-shade, Oyl of Roses being added to it and Populeum Oyntment; but it must be frequently changed before it grows hot. But here three things are to be observed: First, We must not continue too long the use of cooling Medicines; least the Expulsion of the conjunct matter by Sweat should be hindred, and the Tumours should grow Scirrhous. Secondly, in an Inflammation of the Bladder, things that are but a little cooling and astringent must be used, least a Suppression of Urine should happen, which is a Symptom that is very frequent of it self in this Disease. Thirdly, Cataplasms are not so proper in an Inflammation of the Bladder, as Liniments and Oyntments, because they oppress the part with their Weight. Wherefore when cooling Medicines have been used a very little while, and after Bleeding repeated, the Fluxion being pretty well stopt, we must use Emollients, and gentle Resolvents, as Fomentations made of a Decocton of the Roots of Marsh-mallows, of the Leaves of Mallows, Violets, Pellitory, of the Seeds of Flax, Fenugreek, [Page 291](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/304:5.6?vid=65404) Mallows, and of Cotton, of the Flowers of Camomil, Melilot, Rosemary, and Roses; and Liniments are to be applied of Oyl of Lillies, Roses, and with a little Oyl of Camomile, The following Pultis is very softning, and Anodyne. Take of the Crums of white Bread one pound; boil them in Goats-milk to the Consistence of a Pultiss; then add the Yolks of three Eggs, of Oyl of Roses four ounces, of Saffron half a dram; make a Cataplasm; it must be often changed; a little Opium and Camphor may be added to it if the Pain be very violent. If there be danger of a Gangrene, a corroborating Cataplasm must be made of the Meal of Beans, Orobus, and of Lupins boiled in Wine. But when the Inflammation is in a manner taken off, then resolving Decoction and Liniments must be used. In the whole course of the Disease, respect must be always had to the Feaver, Pain, Watchings, Suppressions of Urine, and the like. And to ease the Pain of the Bladder, Anodyne Suppositories, or Yolks of Eggs, with a little Opium, and with the Juice of Henbane, or the like, must be tied up in a rag, and put up the Fundament. If the Inflammation of the Reins cannot be discussed, but tends to Suppuration, which may be known by the Increase of the Feaver, of the Pain, and of other Symptoms; also by shaking and Vomiting, and by a greater Weight about the Part, especially when the Sick bends towards the well Side; the Motion of Nature must be furthered by applying Cataplasms made of emollient Roots, and Herbs, of the Seeds of Flax, and of the Flowers of Camomil, to which being boiled, bruised, and pulped, Meals, Butter, Grease, and proper Oyls must be added, whereby, unless the Abscess break and cleanse it self by Urine, the Matter breaks into the Cavity of the Belly; upon which account sudden Death, or an hectick Feaver follows. Sometimes the Tumour swells outwards, and then it must be opened by a Potential Cautery, or with a Knife. It also happens sometimes, that the Tumours become Scirrhous, the Feaver ceasing, but the Pain continuing with a greater Sense of Weight, and a Numbness of the [Page 292](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/305:5.6?vid=65404) neighbouring Parts, which are most commonly incurable, for the Sick falls into a Cachexy and Dropsie; yet the Cure may be attempted by emollient, inciding, and digestive Medicines. CHAP. LXXXIX. Of Bloody rine. BLood may be conveyed from many Parts to the Urinal Passages, and be mixed with the Urine, and so render it bloody; but that rarely happens, and we only discourse here of Diseases of the Reins and Bladder, and of that bloody Urine which proceeds from the fault of those Parts: The Blood flows from the Reins and Bladder, as from all other Parts, either by opening of the Vessells, by a Rupture, or a Solution of the Continuum, but very rarely, by reason of the Thinness of the Veins which carry Blood to these Places. The most frequent causes, are Fullness and Acrimony of the Blood, and a Stone in the Kidneys, a Fall or Blow, the lifting or carrying of a great Weight, violent Motion of the Body, or the like. When Blood flows from the Bladder it is little in quantity. The Cure of this Disease must be varied according to the Variety of the Causes: And first, If it proceed from a great quantity or Acrimony of the Blood, Bleeding must be used frequently, but little must be taken away at a time; and in this case Cupping glasses, Frictions, and Ligatures must be used to the upper Parts, and Derivation must be made by bleeding in the Foot, or by opening the Hemorrhoidal Veins. When serous and Cholerick Humours promote this Evacuation, they must be purged off by Catharticks used by Intervals. Take of Rubarb a little torrified and powdered one dram, of Coral prepared half a Scruple, of the Whey of Goats-milk, or of Plantane-water, three ounces; make a Potion. [Page 293](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/306:5.6?vid=65404)Take of Cassia fresh drawn half an ounce, of the Pulp of Tamarinds six drams, of Bole-armonick half a Scruple; with Sugar make a Bolus. After due Revulsions and Evacuations, or whilst they are used, if there be occasion, such things as restrain the Blood, and heal the Veins must be given; but they must not be presently used, least the Blood should be stopt too soon, and being thickned, it should coagulate somewhere; for this Purpose the Juice of Plantane fresh drawn is much commended, four or five ounces of it being taken Morning and Evening, which is also very proper in all Hemorrhagies, but if it be too cold for the Stomach, it may be boiled a little with Sugar. Sheeps-milk is also much commended, four ounces of it being taken with a dram of Bole-armenick, but after takeing it, the Sick must not sleep nor exercise himself. Decoctions also of Knot-grass, Horse-tail, Purslain, and of the Tops of Brambles, sweetned with Syrup of Quinces; or to qualifie the Heat of the Blood, the following Apozem may be used. Take of the Leaves of Lettice, Purslain, Plantane, and Comfrey, each one handful; of the four greater and lesser cold Seeds, each one dram; of Jujubes three pair, of Liquorish half an ounce, of the Flowers of Water-lillies, of Violets, and of Roses, each one Pugil; make a Decoction to a Pint and an half; in the strained Liquor dissolve of Gum-tragacanth a dram and an half; of Syrup of Violets, and of dried Roses, each one ounce and an half; of Sal-prunella half an ounce, of the Troches of Alkakengi without Opium half a dram; make an Apozem for four Doses. To thicken and restrain the Blood more powerfully, we may add to it an ounce of Syrup of Poppies. If the Disease be lasting, an Electuary may be made in the following manner. Take of the Conserves of Roses, and of the Roots of Comfrey each two ounces; of sealed Earth, and Bole-Armenick, of Dragons-blood, red Coral, Blood-stone, and Troches of Ambar, each one dram; of Hypocistis, grains of Kermes, and of the Seeds of Plantane, each one scruple; with equal Parts of Syrup of Mirtles, and of Poppies, make an Electuary, whereof let him take the quantity of a Walnut [Page 294](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/307:5.6?vid=65404) Morning and Evening, drinking upon it a little Plantane-water. Dr. Gordon's Troches are also reckoned excellent in this Case. But because Clots of Blood are wont to be retained in the Bladder, and to occasion violent Symptoms, for the Dissolution of them, it will be convenient to drink warm now and then Mallow-water, mixed with a little Vinegar, but the quantity of the Vinegar must be so small, that it can scarce be tasted. Outwardly Topicks must be applied to the Region of the Loins, such as are proper to cool and bind the Reins. Take of the Roots of Bristort, and of Comfrey, each one ounce; of the Leaves of Plantane, Purslain, Shepherds-purse, Knot-grass, each one handful; of the Flowers of Pomegranates half an ounce, of the grains of Sumach, and Mirtles, and of Hypocistis, each two drams; of the Cups of Acorns, and of yellow and red Sanders, each one dram; of red Roses three Pugils; boil them in Smith's-water with a little Vinegar, strain the Liquor, and foment the Reins with it warm. A Bath may be made of the same Decoction the quantity of it being increased. Take of the Juice of Plantane, and of Blood-wort, each two ounces; of Vinegar half an ounce, of Omphacine Oyl one ounce, boil them to the Consumption of the Juices, then add of Dragons-blood, Mastich, and of Pomegranate-peel, each two drams; of Champhor half a dram, of the Countesses Oynoment four ounces, of Wax a sufficient quantity; make a Liniment. Anoint the Loins with it frequently; at the time you use it, mix a little Vinegar with it. Leaden Plates with many holes in them, worn upon the Reins, are very proper. When the Voiding of Blood proceeds from the Stone, the following Method has been found very successful by Dr. Sydenham, who was much troubled with the Gout, the Stone in the Kidneys, and a bloody Urine; and I have also found it very successful, I drank, says he, two ounces and a half of Manna dissolved in a quart of Whey, swallowing now and then a little of the Juice of Lemmons, while I was purging, to quicken this Cathartick, which used to work slowly, and to render it more pleasant to the [Page 295](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/308:5.6?vid=65404) Stomach. It can scarce be said how much Ease I received about the Region of the Reins by the use of this Remedy; for though they did not always ach before, yet they were affected with a heavy and troublesom Pain; and because it succeeded so well with me, I took the same of a set day once a Week for some Months, and after every Purge I plainly found my self better, and could bear the shaking of a Coach when it went fast, and was indeed wholly freed from this Symptom. But it returning again, some time after, I took it twice a Week for three Weeks, and afterwards only once a Week: I continued this Method some Months on set Days, and the Bleeding quite stopped: The Diet that I observed is as follows, In the Morning when I rise I drink a Dish of Tea, at Dinner I moderately refresh my self with any sort of Meat of easie Digestion that I like; a draught of small Beer is to me instead of a Supper; and when I am in Bed I take another draught, that by this Julep I may cool and dilute the hot and acrid Juices lodged in the Kidneys, whereof the Stone is generated; and I prefer at this time, and at Dinner time, small Beer that has Hopps in it, before that which has none, for though that which is not hopped is smoother and softer, and so fitter to carry off the Stone from the Kidneys, yet that which is hopped, by reason of the stiptick Quality which the Hopps impart to it, is not so apt to generate sandy and stony Matter, as that which is not hopped, the Substance whereof is more viscous and slimy. I take care to go to Bed early, especially in Winter; and to prevent a bloody Urine, I take care, that as often as I have occasion to ride a long Way upon the Stones, to drink a large draught of small Beer before I go; and also before my Return, if I be abroad a pretty while, whereby I secure my self pretty well from bloody Urine. CHAP. XC. Of an lcer of the Reins and Bladder. AN Ulcer is occasioned in the Reins and Bladder by three Causes, first, from an Abscess broken, secondly from the Acrimony of the Humours, and thirdly, from [Page 296](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/309:5.6?vid=65404) a rough Stone, and this is the most frequent and ordinary cause. Among the Diagnostick Signs, the first and chief is the voiding of Matter with Urine, which continuing a while, certainly shews an Ulcer in the urinary Passages; but whither the Reins or the Bladder are affected with the Ulcer, may be known by the Situation of the Pain, as whether it be in the Region of the Loins, or in the Pubis, or Perinaeum. Moreover, Matter proceeding from the Reins is better concocted, is white, light, and not at all stinking, because the Parenchyma of the Reins being fleshy concocts better, and the Matter is also in a greater quantity, and more mixt with the Urine, which looks like Milk, along while after voiding it the Matter is seperated from it, and falls to the Bottom of the Chamber-pot. But Purulent Matter flowing from the Bladder, is little and not much mixed with the Urine, nor so concocted, but crude, variegated and stinks much, for the Part having little Heat, cannot sufficiently concoct the Matter, but from the Neck of the Bladder, or from the urinal Passage, pure Matter without Urine is often voided. Moreover, In an Ulcer of the Bladder or of its Neck, there is a continual Heat of Urine, and a continual Pain in the part, which is not so in an Ulcer of the Reins; for in that Ulcer the Heat of Urine and Pain cease sometimes. When the Ulcer is deep, Blood sometimes flows out plentifully, which is difficultly stopt, and often small pieces of the Parts are voided with the Blood and Matter, viz. most commonly small Caruncles from the Reins, sometimes they are larger, and passing difficultly through the Ureters, they occasion a Nephritick Pain, but from the Bladder small Scales, or small Membranous Skins flow like Bran. And lastly, In a long and callous Ulcer of the Bladder, a mucous Flegm is produced. As to the Prognostick, these Ulcers are very difficultly cured, because there is a perpetual Flux of Humours to the Part; for though the Serum of its own Nature is cleansing, yet when it is infected with other qualities it is not so, and when acrid and salt Humours are mixed with it, hey occasion Ulcers, or further them. [Page 297](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/310:5.6?vid=65404)Fresh Ulcers of the Reins and Bladder may be cured, but when they are inveterate they are incurable. In old Men they can never be cured, in young Men they may sometimes, but with great Difficulty. Ulcers that are occasioned by the Stone cannot be cured till the Stone is extracted. The Pain and other Symptoms which accompany these Ulcers, occasion Watchings, and waste the Body, and at length the Sick is brought into a Cachexy and Consumption. The Cure of the Ulcers of the Reins and Bladder, as of all other Ulcers, is performed by cleansing, drying, and consolidating Medicines. To which end the following things may be used. And First, if there be a Plethora, or an Inflammation of the Part, Bleeding must be ordered, first in the Arm, and afterwards in the Foot. Afterwards Purging must be prescribed frequently, that the vitious Humours abounding in the whole Body, and flowing to the Part affected may be evacuated; but only gentle and lenitive Medicines must be ordered, as Cassia, Manna, Syrup of Roses, Rubarb, and Agarick reduced to a Bolus, or some other solid Form, because in a liquid Form they easily run to the Urinary Passage, and so increase the Acrimony. The following Electuary may be prescribed. Take of Polypody of the Oak, and of Liquorish rasped, each half an ounce; of the four greater Cold Seeds each one dram, of the Flowers of Violets, and Borrage, each half a pugil; of Jujubes six pair, of Damask Prunes three pair, of Raisins half an ounce, of Senna cleansed two ounces and an half; infuse them a Night in Barley-water, boil them in the Morning and strain them; afterwards dissolve an ounce and an half of Manna in a sufficient quantity of the Decoction, strain it again, add to it three ounces of Cassia fresh drawn; boil them to the Consistence of an Electuary, adding at last half an ounce of Rubarb powdered. The Dose is one ounce once a Week two Hours before eating. Or, Take of Cassia two ounces, of Manna one ounce and an half, of the Pulp of Sebestines, and Tamarinds, each one ounce; of the Mucilage of the Seeds of Psyllium six drams, [Page 298](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/311:5.6?vid=65404) of the four greater cold Seeds each one dram, of Juice of Liquorish two drams, with Syrup of Roses solutive make an Electuary. If you add Mercurius Dulcis to the Electuaries above mentioned it will succeed the better; for it is of great Vertue to cleanse and heal all inward and outward lcers. Among Purgers Turpentine is reckoned, and is much commended in this case, because it loosens the Belly, and cleanses the Ulcer; half an ounce of it washed in Plantane water must be given in Powder of Liquorish; but it is chiefly to be used when the Urine is very mucous and thick. Vomiting is much commended by many, whereof some provoke it before Meals with warm water and Oyl, with which only Remedy often repeated, they say this Disease has been cured. But it is to be noted, that Vomiting must be only used in those that vomit easily, for violent Vomiting irritates the Ulcer. After due Evacuations and Revulsions we must come to the use of such things as cleanse, the chief of which are Whey drank in a great quantity in the Morning, and small Mead, whereof also six or eight ounces may be taken in a Morning, and it may be used for the ordinary Drink. A Decoction of Barley with Liquorish and Sugar may be used in the same manner. If Mead be thought too hot, the greater cold Seeds, or the Roots of Liquorish, and the Tops of Mallows may be boiled in it. Asses-milk also does not only cleanse but it also consolidates; but it must not be given when there is a Feaver; or the following Decoction may be used. Take of the Roots of Marsh-mallows half an ounce, of the Leaves of Plantane Agrimony, Maiden-hair, and the Tops of Mallows, each one handful; of the Seeds of Mallows, and of Mellons, with the Barks bruised, each half an ounce; of the grains of Alkakengi six drams, of Liquorish rasped one ounce, of whole Barley one pugil; boil them to a quart, in the strained Liquor dissolve of Honey of Roses three ounces, of Sugar-candy two ounces; make a Julep, whereof take eight ounces in a Morning, for ten Days. Those things which are given for Diseases of the Reins and Bladder, must be prescribed in a large quantity, [Page 299](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/312:5.6?vid=65404) for otherwise their Vertues will not reach the Parts affected. But instead of all, Barnet or Epsom-water, or Tunbridge-waters may be used; for by the long use of them, the hot Intemperies will be corrected, and the Ulcers cleansed and cured. Some commend to dry up the Ichor, and to cleanse and heal internal Ulcers, especially in Patients of a Flegmatick Constitution, and for such as have been at any Time infected with the French Pox, and when there is no Feaver nor Flux of Blood, a sudorifick Decoction made of China, Sarsa-parilla, Sassafras, or of Guajacum, to be taken for thirty Days or more, and that the second Decoction should be used for ordinary Drink, with a thin and drying Diet. In the mean time, least the Bowels should be too much inflamed by the use of this Decoction, they may be qualified by cooling Broths given about the Evening, and by anointing the Reins with cooling Oyntments But the following Decoction is safer and more successful in every case. Take of the Roots of Sarsaparilla three ounces, of Lignum Lentiscinum two ounces, of Sassafras one ounce, of the Raspings of Ivory and Harts-horn, each six ounces; of Jujubes, and Sebestines, each half an ounce; of Nephritick Wood four ounces, of Barley cleansed two ounces; infuse them twelve Hours in five pints of Fountain-water, boil it to three, for six Doses to be taken twice a Day. Aromatise them with two drams of Cinnamon. When the Ulcer is sufficiently cleansed, which may be known, for that the Matter is voided with the Urine in a lesser quantity, and is white, and does not stink at all, Astringent things and such as heal must be given, Take of Bole-Armenick, of sealed Earth, and of red Coral, each three drams; of Gum-Arabick, and Tragacanth, each half an ounce; make Troches with Agrimony-Water, weighing each two drams; one of them must be taken Morning and Evening with a Decoction of Comfry. But Dr. Gordon's Troches are better than all the rest, to cleanse and heal Ulcers of the Reins and Bladder; and at the same time ease the Pain, and take off the Heat of Urine; two drams of them may be taken at a time in Mead, or a Decoction of Barley, when you design most to cleanse; and [Page 300](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/313:5.6?vid=65404) in Goats or rather Sheeps Milk, when you chiefly design to heal. Consolidating Juleps may be made in the following manner. Take of the Roots of Comfry two ounces; of the Leaves of Plantane, and Mouse-ear, each one handful; of the Tops of Mallows, and Maiden-hair, each half a handful; of Liquorish an of White-starch, Gum-arabick, Tragacanth, and each one dram; of the Seeds of Lettice, Purslain, each one dram; of the seeds of red Roses one pugil; make a Decoction in Rain-water to one Pint and an half; in the strained Liquor dissolve four ounces of Sugar, and two ounces of Penids; make a Julep, whereof let him take eight ounces in a Morning for ten or twelve Days. The following Pills are also very good. Take of the Roots of Marsh-mallows, and of Comfry dried, of Gum-arabick, and of the Gum of the Cherry-tree, and Prune, each one dram; of Olybanum and Mirrh, each four scruples; of the Seeds of white Poppies, and of Alkakengi, each one dram and an half; of Camphor two scruples; powder them finely, or with a third part of the Weight of all of Ceruss, of Antimony, and with a suffici-quantity of Venice Turpentine, make a Mass for Pills, whereof let him take a dram Morning and Evening. If the Turpentine should cause Pain, the Juice of Liquorish may be used instead of it; but new Cows-milk is the best of all, a quarter of a pint of it being taken with half a dram of Bole-armenick every Morning. In inveterate Ulcers a Decoction of round Birth-wort in White-wine sweetned with Sugar is very beneficial. The following Oyntment may be used outwardly to consolidate the Ulcer. Take of the Juice of Plantane, and Night-shade, each four ounces; of Oyl of Roses Omphacine three ounces, of Vinegar one ounce, of Letharge finely powdered one ounce and an half, of Ceruss washed half an ounce, of Tutty finely powdered two drams; of Dragons-blood one dram; reduce them all to the Form of an Oyntment. Injections are peculiarly proper for an Ulcer of the Bladder, they must be used twice a Day: First, Such as cleanse made of Hydromel, of Whey, or a Decoction of Barley, [Page 301](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/314:5.6?vid=65404) with a littie Honey of Roses; but afterwards astringent and consolidating Injections must be used, wherein the Roots of Comfry, Mirrh, Allum, Sarcocoll, and Tragacanth have been boiled; Dr. dissolved in Milk are of excellent use. Fabritius Hildanus cured a great Ulcer of the Bladder with the following Injection, and with some other Remedies. See his 69 Observation, Cent. 3. Take of the Roots of Comfry one ounce, of whole Barley one handful, of the Leaves of Agrimony, Speedwell, Scordium, Ladies-mantle, Sanicle, each half a handful; boil them to a Pint; in the strained Liquor dissolve of Honey of Roses two drams; mingle them, make an Injection. It is to be noted, that these Injections are not to be squirted in with a Syringe, because they do not penetrate into the Cavity of the Bladder, the Sphincter Muscle hindering; but a Catheter being put into the Bladder, you must syringe through it, and so the Injection will reach the Part affected. But because these Ulcers are commonly painful, all the course of the Cure you must endeavour to mitigate the Pain with Anodynes taken inwardly, and used outwardly, Syrup of Poppies, London Laudanum, and the Troches of Alkakengi, which are peculiarly proper in this case, must be used inwardly: Also Emulsions of the cold Seeds, of the Seeds of white Poppies, adding if there be occasion, Syrup of Poppies. And lastly, The Conserve of the Flowers of Marsh-mallows must be frequently given. And the following Fomentation may be used to the Region of the Reins, Take of the Roots of Marsh-mallows, of the Leaves of Mallows, Pellitory, and Violets, each one handful; of the seeds of Flax, Fenugreek, and Alkakengi, each three drams; of the Flowers of Camomil, Melilot, and Water-lillies, each one Pugil; make a Decoction, wherewith foment the Part with Flannels. After the Fomentation use the following Liniment. Take of Oyl of Violets, and of sweet Almonds, each one ounce and an half; of Oyl of Roses one ounce, of the Mucilages of the Seeds of Marshmallows and Fenugreek, each two ounces; of Suffron one scruple; make a Liniment. [Page 302](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/315:5.6?vid=65404)But to ease the Pain, new Milk from the Cow, with Dr. Gordon's Troches dissolved in it injected, is the best Anodyne, for it eases the pain and cures the Ulcer. CHAP. XCI. Of a Diabetes. THis Disease was so rare amongst the Ancients, that many famous Physicians made no mention of it; but in our Age, wherein excessive Drinking has been, especially of Wine, so much used, there are many Instances of it. As to the Cure, The chief intentions of Healing, are to prevent fusion of the Blood, and to take off that which is so. First, The Fusion of the Blood is hindred, when its gross and watry Parts contain one another, and are contained, so that they do not too hastily separate, which may be effected by thickning Remedies; and for this Purpose Rice, Starch, and Mucilaginous Vegetables, also Gums, and some resinous things are of use. Secondly, That the Fusion of the Blood may be taken off, such Remedies are indicated as dissolve the Concretions of the Salts. I have prescribed in this Disease, the Tincture of Antimony with good success, and Lime-water, with the Seeds of Annise, Raisins, and Liquorish, is much commended by some. A Noble-man fell into a desperate Diabetes, for besides that, he voided a Gallon and an half of clear Urine, that was almost as sweet as Honey, in the space of a Night and a Day; he was also afflicted with great Thirst, a Hectick Feaver, great Weakness, and with a wasting of the whole Body; he was cured in a short time by the following Medicines. Take of the Tops of Cypress eight handfuls, of the Whites of Eggs a quart, of Cinnamon half an ounce; having cut them small, pour upon them four Quarts of new Milk, and distill them in a cold Still. Have a care of an Empyrema. He took six ounces of it thrice a day. Take of Gum-Arabick, and Tragacanth, each six drams; of Penediate Sugar one ounce, make a Powder; give one [Page 303](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/316:5.6?vid=65404) dram, or one dram and an half, twice a day, with three or four ounces of the distilled Water. Take of Rubarb powdered fifteen grains, of Cinnamon six grains, make a Powder; let him take it in the Morning and repeat it six or seven days after. Take of Cowslip-water three ounces, of Cinnamon-water hordeated two drams, with half an ounce of Diacodium; make a draught to be taken at Bed-time every Night. His Diet was altogether in a manner of Milk, which he eat sometimes crude, sometimes boiled, with Bread or Barley; sometimes it was diluted with a distilled water, or with Barley-water. When he had been well a long time, he fell into the same Disease again, and the same Method and Medicines were ordered again, whereby he grew better in a few Days; afterwards he took five or six ounces of Lime-water daily thrice in a Day; and having used it four days, he voided Urine in a moderate quantity well coloured and somewhat salt. I cured another of a deplorable Diabetes by the same Method, especially with Lime-water. CHAP. XCII. Of Incontinence of rine. INcontinence of Urine proceeds from a fault of the retentive Faculty of the Bladder; it befalls either People waking, and then the cause is great, or sleeping, and then it is less, for at that time the Animal Functions are not so freely exercised; and this happens two Ways, viz. Either by the Weakness, or Laxity of the Sphincter Muscle of the Bladder; which sucking Children are subject to, old People, and some in their middle Age, and others by false Imagination; for many there are, who by reason of excessive Drinking, or by reason of the exquisite sense of the Bladder, or sharp Urine, piss in Bed, in some sort willingly; for they imagine in their Sleep, that they are making Water against the Wall or some other Place; and they are so accustomed to this Vice, that they do it where there is no Fault either in Bladder or Muscle of it, and they [Page 304](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/317:5.6?vid=65404) are not cured by Medicines, but by rectifying their Imagination, as in Children by the Rod, and in grown People by placing some precious things upon the Places where they think they make water in their Dreams; and by shewing such things to them often. But a preternatural Disorder occasioning an Incontinence of Urine, is seated in the Sphincter Muscle, which is either affected Sympathically, or Idiopathically, it is affected by Sympathy many Ways, as when the whole Body is weak, and the Natural Heat decayed, as when Death approaches, or when the whole Body, or half of it, is seised with the Palsie, or those Branches of the Nerves only, which arising from the Os sacrum, are communicated to the Bladder. This Resolution of the Muscles, is occasioned sometimes by reason of the Nearness to other Parts affected; as in Women with Child, in swellings and Pains of the Womb, and great Diseases of the right Gut. But the Sphincter Muscle is also affected various ways, Idiopathically, as by Wounds upon it, as it happens in cutting for the Stone, or by reason of deep Wounds that hinder the Contraction and Shutting of it; but the chief and most frequent cause, is a cold and moist Intemperies, whereby that part is weakned and relaxed. This Intemperies is much furthered by a natural cold and moist Constitution, by Childhood, Age; the Feminine Sex, by Diseases of the whole Body, or of some Parts arising from a cold and moist Intemperies, to which may be added, external causes proper to produce such an Intemperies. The Diagnostick Signs of this Disease, either shew a Sympathick Disease, which are to be taken from the Effects proper to produce an Incontinence of Urine mentioned above; and if they are present, we must suppose the Disease proceeds thence; but if they are absent we must count it Idiopathick; and if it be occasioned by a Wound, Ulcer, or any other Disorder of the Sphincter, it is easily known, but if none of these appear, we must consider whither there be a cold and moist Intemperies of the part, which may be known by the Constitution of the Internal and external Causes, and by the Effects of them; as softness of the whole Body, a pale Colour, a Laxity of the Genus Nervosum, and of the genital parts by Childhood, Age, and a Flegmatick Cachexy, and the like. [Page 305](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/318:5.6?vid=65404)As to the Prognostick. This Disease is incurable in old Age, in a Feaver it is dangerous; but it may be cured in Children by increase of Years, for in time the superfluous Moisture may be consumed, and the lax parts rendered firm and strong. The Cure of Involuntary Urine must be directed to the correcting of the cold and moist Intemperies, and to the Laxity of the Sphincter Muscle, for that which is occasioned by Sympathy from other Parts primarily affected, must be referred to the Cure of those Diseases; and that which proceeds from a Wound, Ulcer, and other manifest Diseases, depends on the Cure of them; wherefore the following Method of Cure must be observed, both for Children and grown People; but in Children the most gentle Medicines must be used, and they must be dosed accoding to their Age. First, Bleeding is not of use in this case, unless there be a Plethora of the whole Body in Youth, but Purges are always necessary in this case; they must be made of Phlegmagogue Medicines, and astringent things may be mixed with them, especially such as purge too, as Rubarb, Mirobalanes, and the like. Afterwards Electuaries, medicated Wines, and the like, must be used to dry up the phlegmatick Matter, and to constringe the relaxed part. Take of the Nuts of Cypress, and of Mirtles torrified, of the Raspings of Ivory, Coriander seeds prepared, red Coral, Ambar, each two drams; of Spodium one dram, of the Roots of Cyperus, and Galingal, each half a dram; with candied Citrons; make an Electuary, whereof let him take the quantity of a Chesnut Morning and Evening, drinking upon it a little red Wine. Take of the Roots of Comfry half an ounce, of the Roots of Cyperus, and Galingal, each one dram; of the Leaves of Plantane, Horse-tail, five leaved Grass with the Roots each one handful; of Cypress Nuts and of the Cups of Acorns, each four Scruples; of the seeds of Rue, and of the chast Tree, of Frankincense, and of the Raspings of Ivory, each half a scruple; of red Roses one Pugil, of red Wine two quarts; infuse them twenty four Hours, then strain them, and add to it half an ounce of Cinnamon, and with a sufficient quantity of Sugar make a Claret, whereof let him take three or four ounces twice a day. [Page 306](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/319:5.6?vid=65404)Many Specificks are proposed by Authors for the Cure of this Disease, as the Brains and Testicles of a Hare burnt, also a Cockle in its Shell burnt, and drank; the Dung of a Hare, the Ashes of a Mouse burnt the Hoof of a Boar torrified, the Ashes of Date-stones, the Powder of Egg-shells, but above all the Powder of Agrimony, and the inward Coats of the Stomach of a Hen dried, which may be given a part, or together, in red Wine. Solinander, says, he saw excellent Success by the use of a Cocks Throat torrified, the Powder was taken before Supper in a little red Wine, it was repeated for some Days. In grown People Sudorifick Decoctions made of Guajacum and Sassafrass, and used for twenty Days, are proper to dry the Body. So are also Bath-waters, applied with Flannels. The Sick must drink red rough Wine by it self, or diluted with Chalybeat waters, and he must drink but little at Supper, he must make Water just as he is going into Bed, in the middle of the Night, and early in the Morning. And outwardly Topicks must be applied to the Pubis and Perinaeum, such as heat, strengthen and dry. Take of the Roots of Elecampane, sweet-smelling Flag, of Acorus and Cyperus, each half an ounce; of the Leaves of Mint, Sage, Wild-marjoram, Calaminth, and Wormwood, each half an handful; of the Nuts of Cypress, Mirtles, Galls and Balaustines, each one dram; of red Roses one Pugil; boil them in equal parts of Smiths Water and red Wine, to one quart; in the strained Liquor dissolve of Salt and Allum, each one ounce; foment the Region of the Pubis and Perineum, Morning and Evening hot. Of the same Decoction, the quantity of it being increased, a bath may be made to be used for many days. After the Fomentation or Bath, the Parts may be anointed with a Liniment made of Oyl of Foxes, rue, Orrise, Unguentum, Martiatum, and with the Powder of Mastich, Cyperus, and Mirtles, or the following Plaister may be applied. Take of Labdanum, and Mastich, each two drams; of the Wood of Alces, and of Storax calamite, of Cinnamon, [Page 307](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/320:5.6?vid=65404) and of Turpentine, each one dram; of Mirtles, and of the Roots of Cyperus, each half a dram; of the Juice of Mint and Hors-tail extracted with red Wine, a sufficient quantity; make a Plaister. CHAP. XCIII. Of a total Suppression of Urine, and of the Strangury. A Total Suppression of Urine is called by Authors Ischuria, but when the voiding of Urine is lessened they term it a Strangury. An Ischuria or total Suppression of Urine is twofold, viz. true when the Bladder is full, and false when the Bladder is empty, and nothing comes from the Reins to it. The true Ischury depends on three Causes, the first whereof is Sense abolished in the Bladder by reason of a Palsie or Obstruction of its Nerve, or because the Spirits are diverted another Way, as in a Delirium or the like. The second cause is a cold Intemperies of the Bladder. The third Cause is a narrowness of the Neck of the Bladder, and of this three Causes are assigned, for the Muscle incompassing the Neck of the Bladder is so swelled that the Passage is stopt, or a Caruncle grows in the Neck of the Bladder, or a Callus is generated there, the Passage is also obstructed by a Stone, by a thick Humour, a Clot of Blood, or by Matter. The Passage is also stopt by a Swelling of the neighbouring parts, as by a large Child in the Womb, by the Excrements hardened in the right Gut, and by the Piles much swelled. This Suppression also happens sometimes by too great a quantity of Water retained too long, that so much distend, the whole Body of the Bladder, that it cannot be contracted to expel it; first, when any Person that is well retains his Urine for want of a Convenient Place to void it in, or when the Nerves of the Bladder are affected, so that the Bladder cannot be sensible of the Weight and Fulness. A false ischury is occasioned by reason either the Serum is not put off upon the Reins, or not conveighed through the Ureters, they being stopt by a Stone or the like. A true Ischury is known by a Weight and Tension of the Hypogaster, and by a Swelling resembling the Bladder. The causes of it are known by things that go before, and accompany it; for if it proceed from a large quantity of [Page 308](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/321:5.6?vid=65404) Urine, which hinders a Contraction of the Bladder, it is perceived by the Relation of the Sick, he having omitted to make Water, by reason of long travelling, or by being in the presence of great Persons; and if he never had it before in those parts; but if he be delirious or paralitick, the Suppression of Urine may be imputed to either of these Diseases. The Compression that is made by Tumours, of those or of the neighbouring parts, or by other Causes above mentioned may be known by the proper Signs of those Diseases. The Obstructions of the Channel of the Bladder may be known by probing it with a Wax Candle, or a Catheter; and if they do not penetrate, but stop in the Passage, it is a Sign that a Stone or a Caruncle, or some other Matter obstructs; and these things that obstruct may be distinguished, viz. If a Stone stop the Channel, Nephritick Pains went before, if it fell from the Reins, and if it was bred in the Bladder, or lay a long while there, the Signs of the Stone in the Bladder preceded, at least some of the gentlest of them; if a Caruncle stop the Passage, a virulent Gonorrhea preceded, or an Ulcer in the Passage of the Yard, that emitted purulent Matter for a long time. Lastly, If clotted Blood, or concreted Matter, or thick Pus, occasioned the Obstruction, small parts of them have been evacuated through the Yard, or have stuck to the Catheter, when it has been used. A false Ischury may be known, for that there is no Tension nor no Tumour nor Weight in the Region of the Pubis, but rather a Vacuity is perceived there; there is no desire of making Water, nor no Irritation of the Bladder; and when the Catheter is used it passes in easily; but Signs of the Stone in the Kidneys went before, or of an Inflammation of the Ureters, or of great Fullness, or large Drinking went before, but little Urine followed; upon which account the Veins were too much filled. Or Lastly, there is a burning Feaver or a Dropsie, whereby the Serous Matter is diverted. As to the Prognostick, A Suppression of Urine is very dangerous, if it exceed the Seventh Day it certainly kills, for the Serum regurgitates upon the whole Body, and the Patient is in danger of a Suffocation, or a Coma. Suppression of Urine, occasioned by a Wound in the Spine, or by reason of a Luxation of a Vertebra is incurable. If the Smell of Urine can be perceived from the Mouth, or Nostrils of the Sick, it is deadly. If a Tenesmus come upon a Suppression of Urine, the Sick dies in seven Days. The Hickops also indicate sudden Death. The Cure of a Suppression of Urine, whether it be total or partial, is to be directed to the taking off the Causes: And [Page 309](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/322:5.6?vid=65404) First, The false Ischury, that depends on the Diseases of the Reins or Ureters, must be cured in the same manner as an Inflammation, a nephritick Pain, or the Stone in the Kidneys: But that which proceeds from a Fulness of the Emulgent Veins must be cured by large Bleeding, and by Hydragogue Medicines. A true Ischury must be also cured by Remedies that take off the cause producing it. And First, If it proceed from an Inflammation of the Bladder, or neighbouring Parts, it must be cured as an Inflammation of the Bladder is; but if the Suppression is caused by a Stone thrust into the Neck of the Bladder, it must be removed by the following Remedies. First, The Sick must be laid upon his Back, and his Legs must be elevated, and he must be shook much, and a long while, that the Stone may fall back into the Bladder; and if by this means it cannot be moved, it must be forced back with a Catheter; but if the Stone has passed into the Passage of the Yard, we must endeavour by all Ways to exclude it, by moving gently with the Fingers towards the end of the Yard, and also by dipping the Yard into warm Milk, or by placing the Sick in a Bath, to enlarge the Passage: But if it will neither go backwards nor forwards, Practitioners teach that it must be cut out, the upper and lower part being tied. But an Obstruction of the Neck of the Bladder, which proceeds from an Inflammation, must be cured by proper Remedies for an Inflammation. But in the mean time, if the Urine be retained too long, it may be gently let out by a Wax-candle dipt in Oyl of sweet Almonds: But you must forbear the Use of a Catheter, least Pain being occasioned, you should increase the Inflammation thereby. But the Suppression of Urine, which proceeds from a Caruncle, must be cured by the Extirpation of the Caruncle. This must be done by proper Remedies thrust in by a skillful Chirurgion upon a Wax-candle. But Necessity urging, for sometimes the Caruncle swells, and obstructs the whole Channel, we must use the Catheter to evacuate the Water, though there is danger that the Part will swell more. But you must first endeavour to lessen the Inflation of the Caruncle by Bleeding and Vomiting, and by repelling Medicines applied to the Pubes and Perinaeum. If the Suppression of Urine be occasioned by thick Flegm, Purging is first convenient, with Diaphaenicon and Rubarb made up in a Bolus, and afterwards Turpentine must be given frequently with Powder of Liquorish; afterwards a Decoction of the opening Roots may be given, with Oxymel and Byzantine Syrup. [Page 310](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/323:5.6?vid=65404)In the mean while Glisters, Fomentations, and emollien and opening Baths must be used; and all those things are proper that are proposed to dissolve or expell the Stone. And amongst the rest the following are found by Experience peculiarly proper. Take of Benedictum Laxativum half an ounce, of the Troches of Mirrh two scruples, of a Decoction of Savin three ounces; mingle them, make a Potion, whereby a Suppression of Urine was cured in a short time in a certain Woman. If there seem to be abundance of Flegm in the whole Body, a universal Purge by an Apozem prepared for three or four Days must be ordered, which is proper at the beginning, Bleeding being first used. A Julep also of the Juice of Pellitory, of Sea-fennel, and of Lemmons, with Oyl of sweet Almonds, is also very beneficial. Dodoneus mentions an Observation of one of eighty Years of Age, that was perfectly cured of a Suppression of Urine, by only using once a Lee made of the Ashes of Egg-shells, mixed with Rhenish-wine. Arnoldus Villa Novanus commends Winter-cherry-wine, and he mentions a Cardinal, who had not made Urine for four Days, and was much swelled, was cured by drinking Winter-cherry-wine; the Wine was made by beating five or seven or more winter-cherries with good White-wine; afterwards it must be strained. Millepedes also beat and given in White-wine are very Effectual to provoke Urine; Oyl of Scorpions of Mathiolus also forces Urine powerfully, five or six drops of it being given with Broth or some other Liquor. The frequent use of Sal-prunella does also the same, especially when there is danger of an Inflammation, which is often occasioned in the inner Coat by the Urine too long retained; Spirit of Salt also does the same, but is more effectual; the Juice of Pellitory clarified, and four ounces of it given with half an ounce of Sugar is very good; Sal-prunella, or the Spirit of Salt may be mixed with it. If Suppression of Urine occasioned by a phlegmatick Matter often recur, nothing is better than the Bath-waters, which easily dissolve and cleanse away the Mucilaginous Matter. A certain Nobleman, that was afflicted with a Suppression of Urine for many Days, after other Medicines used to no Purpose, was freed by injecting the following Glyster, which he retained two Hours. Take of the Roots of Smallage and Parsly, Knee holm, Asparagous Mallows, each two of Daucus, Bishop-weed, bastard 311](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/324:5.6?vid=65404) of the Flowers of Camomil, Mellilot, Dill, and Stoechas, each two Pugils; boil them in Whitewine till half is consumed; in one Pint of the strained Liquor dissolve four ounces of fresh Butter, of Honey of Roses two ounces, of red Sugar one ounce, of Benedictum Laxativum half an ounce, of the Yolk of one Egg, of Oyls of Nuts, Dill, or Linseeds, one ounce; make a Glister. In the whole Course of the Cure Fomentations, Liniments, Cataplasms, Baths, and the like, must be used; among other things a Cataplasm of Pellitory fried with Butter, or rather with Oyl of Scorpions is good; also a Bladder half full of Oyl wherein Cantharides have been boyled. A Cataplasm made of Onyons fried in Lard and with some Oyl, is commonly applied to the Region of the Pubis and Loins. When an Ischury proceeds Oxymel of Syrup Sorrel, and the like, must be used; and Cow-dung outwardly applied does Wonders. Lastly, when the Suppressions proceeds from Pus, things that cleanse and incide must be used, such chiefly as were proposed for an Ulcer of the Reins and Bladder. CHAP. XCIV. Of a Dysury, or Heat of rine. THe next and immediate Cause of rendring Urine with Pain, is a Solution of the Continuum in the Sphincter Muscle, or Channel of the Bladder, and therefore whatsoever causes Solution of the Continuum in those Parts, occasions also a Dysury or Heat of Urine. Among these Causes, the chief and most frequent is an Acrimony of the Urine, sometimes simple without the Mixture of other Humours, which a hot Intemperies of the Bowels, or of the whole Body, or the use of acrid and hot Meats, occasions it. But it is most commonly from a Mixture of acrid Humours, sometimes Matter flowing from the Reins or Bladder ulcerated, occasion such an Acrimony in the Urine, and sometimes a white and Milky Matter that is emitted plentifully with the Urine, occasions the Heat of it; also a Stone in the Bladder, or Gravel produces the same. Lastly, An Inflammation, as in a Gonorrhea, as long as the Prostratae are Inflamed, the Heat of Urine continues. [Page 312](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/325:5.6?vid=65404)The Signs of the Causes may be thus distinguished, If it proceeds from an Acrimony, the Urine is thin and high coloured, or there will be a Mixture of Purulent Matter, and an Intemperies of the Bowels went before, or hot and acrid Aliments, the Heat of the Air or the like heating causes preceded. Lastly, Stones and Inflammations of these parts, may be known by their proper Signs. As to the Prognostick, This Disease is not of it self dangerous, but is very troublesome to the Patient, and is sometimes difficultly cured, especially in old Men, who, if they are decrepid, have it as long as they live; and if it continue long in any Age, it ulcerates the Neck of the Bladder. The Cure is first to be directed to the taking off the Cause; and therefore if it arise from the Stone, an Inflammation, or from an Ulcer of the Bladder, or the Neck of it, the Cure must be taken from the Chapters of these Diseases; but those things which are mentioned below, may much abate the Symptom. But that which proceeds from an Acrimony of Urine, and from hot Humours mixed with it, must be cured with the following Remedies. And first, To qualifie the Intemperies of the Parts, frequent Bleeding is necessary, and it must be often repeated, if there be a great quantity of Blood, or danger of an Inflammation: Purges are also convenient in this Disease, but they must be lenitive and cooling, for otherwise they mightily exasperate the Heat of Urine, wherefore some do not dare to give any thing besides a simple Bolus of Cassia; and this is certainly to be preferred before all other things. Yet it may be made more cooling if Tamarinds are added to it, or a Decoction of Lettice, Purslain, and the Tops of Mallows with Cassia, may be taken for many Days, that the acrid Humours flowing to the Urinary parts, may be by degrees turned upon the Bowels, but yet if a large quantity of ill Humours requires more Purging, we may use the following Potion. Take of the Leaves of Lettice, Purslain, Plantane, and the Tops of Mallows, each half an ounce; of Tamarinds, half a dram, of yellow Mirobalans one dram; boil them to six ounces; in the strained Liquor dissolve one ounce of Cassia fresh drawn; strain them again, and afterwards add the Infusion of one dram and an half of Rubarb in Lettice water, with yellow Sanders, of Manna, and of Syrup of Roses, each one ounce; make a Potion. Vomiting also, with gentle Remedies, is excellent, for it makes Revulsion from the Part affected, and does not occasion those Disorders that Purging does; and therefore such as [Page 313](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/326:5.6?vid=65404) can bear Vomiting well, may take a gentle Vomit once or twice a Week. Glisters also frequently injected do good. Take of the Roots of Marsh-mallows one ounce, of the Leaves of Mallows, Violets, and Lettice, each one handful; of the flowers of Water-lillies, and of Barley cleansed, each one Pugil; boil them to a Pint, in the strained Liquor dissolve an ounce of Cassia newly extracted, one whole Egg, and two ounces of Oyl of Violets; make a Glister. The Mucilages of the Seeds of Marsh mallows, Quinces, Fenugreek, may be mixed with Glisters to ease the Pain. But to qualifie the Heat, and to ease the Pain, Glisters of Milk by it self or mixed with the foregoing things are usually so effectual, that I have known some eased of long Pains with this Remedy only, and by the Bath which shall be mentioned by and by. But many things may be given inwardly to asswage the Pain, and to correct the Intemperies of the Parts affected. Take of the Waters of Purslain, Lettice, and Water-lillies, each one ounce; of the Syrup of Violets, and of Water-lillies, each six drams; Sal-prunella one dram; mingle them, make a Julep to be repeated often. Emulsions may be also used, though they are diuretick, because they cool and gently cleanse the Urinary Passages. Take of the four greater cold Seeds, and of White Poppies, each three drams; of Sweet Almonds blanched, and infused in cold water, half an ounce; bruise them in a Marble Mortar, and pour upon them gently a pint and an half of the Decoction of Barly, of Liquorish, and the Tops of Mallows; make an Emulsion for three Doses, adding to each one ounce of Syrup of Violets, and a dram of Sal-prunella; if the Pain be very violent, some Syrup of Poppies may be added to it, and a dram of Gum Arabick powdered. Broths may be also prepared in the following manner. Take of the Roots of Marshmallows half an ounce, of Mallows one handful, of Liquorish half an ounce, of the Seeds of Quinces one dram; boil them with Chicken Broth, and let it be taken for several Days together. The Whey of Goats Milk is also very good, a large draught of it being taken at a time; and if there be no Feaver, milk it self is more effectual, especially Asses Milk. If the Disease is inveterate, Epsom and Tunbridge-waters are very proper. Forestus cured himself of a violent Dysury, by only using a Decoction of Mallows sweetned with Syrup of Violets; a Conserve of Mallows has also done much good, an ounce of it having been taken Morning and Evening, and three ounces [Page 314](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/327:5.6?vid=65404) of Mallow-Water being drank presently after; the Conserve of the Flowers of Marshmallows is as good or rather better; some Practitioners commend the Troches of Alkakengi; a dram of them being taken at a Time in some proper Liquor. When the Pain is very violent, the dipping the Yard in Milk, whilst the Urine is rendring, or in a Decoction of Mallows, and the Seeds of white Poppies, does much good in this case. A small decoction of Mallows sweetned with Syrup of Violets, or with Conserve of Roses, is very proper for the ordinary Drink. And to ease the Pain, Injections may be made for the Passage of the Bladder of Milk, an Emulsion of the cold Seeds of Plantane and Whey, whereunto may be added the White of an Egg well beaten, and a Scruple of the Troches of Alkakengi. External Remedies do also much good to qualifie the Heat of Urine, as Baths and Fomentations applied to the Pubis and Perinaeum, made of a Decoction of cooling Herbs; also Liniments made of Oyls of Roses, of white-lillies, and of Oyntment of Roses, and of the white Oyntment with Camphor. CHAP. XCV. Of a Chlorosis, or the Green-Sickness. THe Green-Sickness is a vitious Habit of the Body proceeding from Obstructions, it is accompanied most commonly with a Palpitation of the Heart, Difficulty of Breathing, and a longing for absurd things, and with an Unfitness for Motion, and other Symptoms. The Diagnostick manifestly appears by the following Series of Symptoms. First, The Face and whole Body is pale, and sometimes of a leaden, livid, and green Colour. Secondly, An Inflation, and as it were a Swelling, appears upon the Eyelids; the Legs also swell, especially about the Ankles. Thirdly, There is a Dulness and Unwillingness for Motion. Fourthly, There is a Difficulty of Breathing, especially when they move much, or go up Stairs. Fifthly, There is a Palpitation of the Heart upon Motion. Sixthly, There is a heavy, and often a lasting pain of the Head. Seventhly, The Pulse is quick. Eighthly, The Sick are drowsie, and incline to Sleep. Ninthly, There is a great Aversion for wholesome Food. Lastly, The Disease increasing, and the Obstructions being multiplied, a Suppression of the Courses at length follows which shews the Disease is confirmed. [Page 315](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/328:5.6?vid=65404)As to the Prognostick, This Disease most commonly is no dangerous, but if it be neglected too much, it occasions great Diseases, as a Scirrhus, Tumours, a Dropsie, and other griet\u00a6vous Diseases, which at length kill the Patient. When the Disease is small, and chiefly arises from Obstructions of the Veins of the Womb, it is easily cured by Marriage in Young Virgins. Women that have had this Disease a long while, are either barren, or bring forth Children that are Sickly and short liv'd. There is great Hopes of Cure, when the Courses keep their exact Periods, and flow in a due Quantity and Quality. The Cure of this Disease is performed by opening Obstructions, by purging off the vitious Humours, by Correcting the Intemperies of the Bowels, and by Strengthning them. First therefore, A gentle Purging Medicine must be given that is agreeable to the Constitution, that the first Region may be only emptied; and if the Belly be bound, a Glister must be given first of all. Afterwards Bleeding must be ordered, unless the Disease is very inveterate, and the Maid be inclined to a Cachexy. But a Vein in the Arm must be opened, though the Courses are stopped, for at that Time if you should bleed in the Foot, the Obstructions of the Veins and of the Womb would be increased: That quantity of Blood being taken away that is necessary, proper Purges must be used, viz. Take of the Pill Coch Major two Scruples, of Castor powdered two grains, of Peruvian Balsam four Drops; make four Pills, let her take them at five in the Morning, and let her sleep after them. Let these Pills be repeated twice or thrice every Morning, or every other Morning, according to the Strength of the Sick and their Operation. After the purging Pills let her take the following. Take of the Filings of Steel grains eight, with a sufficient quantity of Extract of Wormwood; make two Pills to be taken in the Morning, and they must be repeated at five in the Afternoon. She must continue this Course for thirty Days, drinking presently after the Pills a Draught of Wormwood Wine. If a Bolus be more pleasing. Take of the Conserve of Roman-Wormwood and of the Conserve of the yellow Peel of Oranges, each one ounce; of candied Angelica, and Nutmegs candied, and of Venice Treacle, each half an ounce; of Ginger candied two drams, with a sufficient quantity of Syrup of Oranges, Make an Electuary. Take of this Electuary one dram and an half, of the Filings of Steel well powdered eight grains, with a sufficient quantity [Page 316](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/329:5.6?vid=65404) of Syrup of Oranges, make a Bolus to be taken in the Morning, and at five in the afternoon, drinking upon it a draught of Wormwood-wine. Take of choice Mirrh, and of Galbanum, each one dram and an half; of Castor sixteen grains, with a sufficient quantity of Peruvian Balsam; make twelve Pills of each dram. Let her take three every Night at Bed time, drinking upon them three or four Spoonfuls of compound Briony water through the whole Course: But if these Pills should purge, then the following must be used instead of them. Take of Castor one dram, of Volatile Salt of Ambar half a dram, with a sufficient quantity of Extract of Rue; make five and twenty small Pills. Let her take three every Night at Bed-time. CAHP. XCVI. Of the Suppression of the Courses. THere is said to be a Suppression of the Courses, when in Women of a mature Age, that neither give suck, nor are with Child, the Evacuation of Blood by the Womb, which naturally is wont to be monthly, seldom or sparingly proceeds or is wholly stopt. The Cause of this Suppression, is to be referred either to the Womb or to the Vessels of it, or to the Blood which flows or ought to flow through them. Various Diseases of the Womb may occasion this Suppression, namely a cold moist Intemperies, or a hot and dry Intemperies; also organical Diseases of the Part, as an Inflammation, or Scirrhus, or the like. The Vessels of the Womb also often occasion Obstructions, which is the most frequent cause of the Suppression of the Courses, they being stopt by cold and thick Humours, or compressed by Swellings of the neighbouring Parts. The Blood is peccant, when it is thick and Clammy, or when it is evacuated by other ways, as by the Nostrils, Vomiting, Spitting, Hemorrhoides, and many other Parts. I saw, sayes Riverius, a Girl that had a Pustle in the Head which opened Monthly, and evacuated a large quantity of Blood; and I have seen many, says he, that by casting up Blood Periodically from the Lungs, had the Courses that Way. The external Causes occasioning this Suppression, are cold and dry Air, and a Northerly Season going into Cold Water, especially when the Courses flow, too little or too much Nourishment [Page 317](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/330:5.6?vid=65404) taken, also gross and cold Meats, or such as are astringent and such as are too hot, or such as are salted and spiced too much, violent exercise, immoderate Watchings, much sleep, immoderate Ease, Bleeding at the Nose, or Piles, a Loosness, and other Evacuations by Vomit, Urine, and Sweat: And lastly, violent Passions, as extream Anger, a sudden Fright, long Sorrow, great Jealousie, and the like. The Diagnostick of the Suppression must be received from the Sick; but because it proceeds both from natural and preternatural causes, the Signs of both shall be distinctly proposed, least Physicians should be deceived by Women being with Child, by illegitimate Coition, and so prescribe Medicines to provoke the Courses rashly to Women with Child. First therefore, Women with Child most commonly retain their natural Colour, and others do not. Secondly, the Symptoms which use to happen to Women with Child, at the beginning abate daily; but on the contrary, in a Suppression of the Courses, the longer they are stopt, so much the more the Symptoms are increased. Thirdly, In Women with Child, after the third Month, the Motion and Situation of the Child may be sensibly perceived, by laying the hand on the Belly; but in others the Swelling is Oedematous, and not at all hard; nor is it always contained within the Limits of the Womb. Fourthly, If the inward Mouth of the Womb be touched by a Skilful Midwife, she will find it not exactly closed, as it is in Women with Child, but rather hard, contracted, and somewhat painful. Fifthly, Women with Child are most commonly chearful; but on the contrary in a Suppression they are most commonly sorrowful and sad. The Faults of the Womb which occasion a Suppression, may be seen by Inspection, and be felt by touching the Parts. The Obstruction and Narrowness of the Vessels of the Womb, may be known by the Disorder that is felt in the Loyns, and in the Parts near the Womb, especially just before the Coming of the Courses; and if any thing flows out it is mucous, whitish or blackish. The Diseases of the neighbouring Parts, which stop the Mouth of the Womb, or the Veins, may be known by their proper Signs. An abundance of Blood may be known by the Veins being much swelled in the Legs and Arms, if the Woman be fleshy, and of a ruddy Countenance, and has indulged her self for a long while in high Eating. But a Defect of Blood may be guessed at, if the Woman be fat, if she has had a long Feaver, and has fasted a long while or has loathed he Meat. An ll [Page 318](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/331:5.6?vid=65404) quality of the Blood may be known by an ill Habit of Body; the preposterous Motion of the Blood, viz. When it flows by contrary Passages, is manifest of it self. As to the Prognostick, a Suppression of the Courses is very dangerous, and many desperate Diseases rise from it; some in the Womb, as Tumours Abscesses, and Ulcers; others in the whole Body, and in various Parts, as Feavers, Obstructions, Cachexies, Loathing of Meat, a Dropsie, a Cardialgia, a Cough, Difficulty of Breathing, Fainting, Melancholly, Madness, Pains of the Head, Gout, and many others; if the Suppression continue long the Belly grows hard, great quantity of Urine is voided, there is a Loathing of Meat, and long Watching, the Legs, Feet, and Belly swell, and they die of a Dropsie. The Cure of this Disease must be varied according to the Variety of the Causes. And first, If it proceed from too great a quantity of Blood, Bleeding must be ordered in the Arm, and a large quantity of Blood must be taken away, afterwards it must be drawn downwards by opening the lower Veins, about the time the Woman used to have her Courses before she was ill. Frictions, Ligatures, Cupping-glasses, with and without Scarification, may be used. If by reason of want of Blood the Courses stop, as after long Feavers, after great Evacuations, and when the Body is much wasted, you must not endeavour to provoke the Courses, till the Body is replenished, and till a sufficient quantity of Blood is bred; which being done, they generally follow of their own accord. But if it happen that Nature forget her Office, she must be roused up by opening the lower Veins, and by Medicines proposed in the foregoing Chapter; but the quantity of Blood taken away must be moderate, least the Strength should be dejected, and the Sick should fall into a Consumption. But here it must be carefully noted, That every Wasting of the Body does not indicate a Want of Blood; but only that which succeeds great Evacuations, and the like; for sometimes it happens, that the Courses being suppressed, and retained in the Veins, occasion an ill quality, whereby the Blood is rendred unfit to nourish the Parts; upon which account the Body wasts though the Veins are full of Blood, in which Case large Bleeding is required. As to the Suppression of the Courses, which happens by a preposterous Motion of the Blood, when it is evacuated by Bleeding at the Nose, by Vomiting, Spitting, or the Hemorrhoides, and other Parts. The Cure of it is performed by repelling the Blood from the Parts through which it flows preternaturally, and by drawing [Page 319](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/332:5.6?vid=65404) it back to the Passage of the Womb. The first is performed, when the Blood rushes out of the upper Parts, by washing the Arms, Head, and Face with cold water, and by forbearing the Exercise of those Parts, especially Singing, and speaking aloud. The second is performed by opening the inferior Veins three or four Days before the Blood breaks out, and by Cupping-glasses applied to the Thighs and Legs, sometimes with, sometimes without Scarification, by provoking the Hemorrhoids, by Frictions, Ligatures, Walking, Fomentations, Baths made of opening Herbs, Pessaries, uterine Glisters, and by other things to be described below. But the Bath-water is especially commended, and the Sick must bath in them often a good while after Meals; but the Water must not rise above the Hypochondres, and at the same time, the upper Parts must be cooled by fanning them. If the Blood flow by the Hemmorrhoides, the Cure is very difficult, for if you use things to draw downwards, they bring the Blood also to the Fundament; and if you use astringent things to it, they, by reason of the Nearness of the Parts, repel what should be brought to the Womb, so that the only Way of Cure, is to apply such things to the Womb as may allure the Blood thither, after you have used such things as draw the Blood downwards. But the most frequent Obstruction of all, is that which proceeds from an Obstruction of the Veins of the Womb, the Cure whereof is in a manner the same with that of the Green Sickness: But the Eruption of them must be helpt by opening a Vein in the Foot about the time they used to flow when the Patient was well; as also by Cupping-glasses applied to the Hips and Legs, instead of Bleeding with, or without Scarification, by Frictions of those Parts, and by painful Ligatures. Take of the Roots of round Birthwort half a dram, of the leaves of dried Savin one dram and an half, of Dittany of Crete, and of Troches of Mirrh, without Assa-Faetida, each one dram; of choice Cinnamon two drams, of white Sugar two ounces; make a Powder, whereof let her take two drams every Morning for some days, with the Broth of red Vetches wherein two drams of Cinnamon, and half a dram of Saffron have been boiled. Take of Roots of Briony, of Lillies, Cyperus, Valerian, Angelica, Asarabacca, Orris, Bays, Rue, Savin, Thym, Rosemary, Penny-royal, Nep, Mallows, Mercury, each one handful; of the Flowers of Elder, of Wall-flowers, and of Camomil, each two Pugils; of the grains of Juniper two ounces; boil them in Water and Whitewine; with the strained Liquor foment the Belly and Thighs with a Spunge. [Page 320](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/333:5.6?vid=65404)With the same Decoction, the quantity being increased, a Bath may be made, wherein the Sick may sit up to the Navel, and the boiled Herbs being put in a Bag, may be applied to her Belly; but you must take care that she does not sweat, for that rather stops the Courses. Take of the Leaves of Mercury bruised one handful, of the Powder of Hiera Picra, and of Benedictum Laxativum, each two drams; of the Powder of long Birthwort one dram, with a sufficient quantity of Honey, or the Juice of Mercury; make a Pessary Injections are also wont to be made for the Womb, which are called uterine Glisters, for they cleanse it from Filth sticking to the Sides, and they open the inner Orifices of the Vessels: They may be prepared with a Decoction for the Fomentation above described, the acrid things being left out, or of fat Figs with Mugwort, Penny-royal, Mercury, or only of the Juice of Mercury clarified, wherein a little Benedictum Laxativum has been dissolved, for you must not use acrid things, lest they should occasion an Inflammation. And after the use of these things, which must be retained only an hour, it is convenient to inject a Decoction of Mallows, Barley, and Violets, or a little Hydromel diluted with the Whey of Goats Milk. When the Disease is inveterate, Issues in the Leg do much good. In the use of the forementioned Medicines some things are to be observed. First, You must never use Remedies to force the Courses, unless general Evacuations went before. Secondly, You must begin with gentle Means, and proceed by degrees to stronger. Thirdly, Medicines that are given to move the Courses must be taken in a large quantity. Fourthly, Pessaries and uterine Glisters must be prescribed only for married Women: But for Virgins Fomentations, Baths, and the following Fume may be ordered. Take of Cloves, Cinnamon, and Mace, each two drams; of Juniper-berries half an ounce, of the Seeds of Nigella one dram, of Storax Calamit two drams; make a gross Powder which must be cast upon Coals, and the Fume must be received through a Tunnel. Lastly, In Cholerick and Melancholly Constitution, the hottest Medicines must be avoided, and only such as are gentle must be used, and things that are opening, moistening, and mollifying, must be mixed with them. [Page 355](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/334:5.6?vid=65404) CHAP. XCV. Of an immoderate Flux of the Courses. AN immoderate flux of the Courses invades either in Child-bed, or at other Times: As to the first, that afflicts Women most on the first Days after a difficult Labour, and is accompanied with a long train of Hysterick Symptoms; and as it happens only on the first days, so usually does not last long, for if a thickning Diet be ordered, it soon abates. The following Drink may be also used. Take of Plantain Water, and red Wine, each one pint; boil them till a third part is consumed: Sweeten it with a sufficient quantity of white Sugar, and let her take half a pint of it twice or thrice a day, and in the mean while some gentle Hysterick Julep may be used, and the following Nodulus may be often held to the Nostrils. Take of Galbanum and Assa Foetida, each two drachms, of Castor one Drachm and an half, of volatile Salt of Amber half a drachm; mingle them, make a Nodulus. Or two drachms of spirit of Sal Armoniack may be often held to the Nose. But as to the Flux which happens out of Child-Bed, though it befals Women at any Time, yet most commonly it invades a little before the Time they leave them, viz. when they are about forty five Years of Age, if they had them very young, and about fifty if it was late before they began to have them: And by reason of the great quantity of Blood, which is continually evacuated, they are almost continually seized with Hysterick Fits; and though in this Case Hystericks both inward and outward may be used by the by (but you must forbear the strongest, lest they should further the Flux) yet the Cure must be managed by such things as stop the Flux. [Page 356](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/335:5.6?vid=65404)You must bleed in the Arm, and eight Ounces of Blood must be taken away. The next Morning the following Purge must be given. Take of Tamarinds half an ounce, of Sna two drachms, of Rhubarb one drachm and an half, infuse them in a sufficient quantity of Fountain Water: In three ounces of the strained Liquor dissolve of Manna and syrup of Roses solutive, each one ounce; make a purging Potion, which is to be repeated every third day for twice, every night at bed-time, through the whole course of the Disease; let an Anodyn be given of an ounce of Diacodium. Take of the conserve of dryed Roses two ounces, of the Troches of Lemnian Earth one drachm and an half, of Pomgranate peel, and of red Coral prepared, each two scruples, of Blood-stone, of Dragon's-blood, and of Bole-Armenick, each two scruples; with a sufficient quantity of simple Syrup of Coral make an Electuary, whereof let her take the quantity of a large nutmeg in the morning and at five in the afternoon, drinking upon it six spoonfuls of the following Julep. Take of the waters of Oak-buds, and of Plantain, each three ounces, of Cinnamon-water hordeated, and of Syrup of dried Roses, each one ounce, of Spirit of Vitrial a sufficient quantity, to make it pleasantly acid. Take of the Leaves of Plantain, and of Nettles, each a sufficient quantity, beat them together in a Marble-Mortar, and press out the Juice, clarifie it and give six spoonfuls of it cold three or four times in a day. After the first Purge apply the following Plaster to the Region of the Loins. Take of the Plasters of Diapalma, and ad herniam, each equal parts, mix them and spread them upon Leather. A cooling and thickning Diet must be ordered, only it may be proper to allow once or twice a day a small Glass of Claret; which tho' it be not so proper, because it is apt to raise an ebullition, yet it may be allowed to recover the Strength. This Method may be also used to prevent Miscarriage, but the Juices and the Purges must be omitted. [Page 357](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/336:5.6?vid=65404) CHAP. XCVI. Of the Whites. THis obstinate and lasting Disease may be cured by Bleeding once, and by purging with two Scruples of Pill. Coch. major four times, and by the following Corroboratives. Take of Venice Treacle one ounce and an half, of the Conserve of the yellow Peel of Oranges one ounce, of Diascordium half an ounce, of Ginger candied, and Nutmegs candied, each three drachms, of compound Powder of Crabs-eyes, one drachm and an half, of the outward Peel of Pomgranates, of the Roots of Spanish Angelica, and of the Troches of Lemnian Earth, each one drachm, of Bole-armenick two scruples, of Gum Arabick half a drachm, with a sufficient quantity of Syrup of dried Roses make an Electuary; whereof let her take the quantity of a large Nutmeg in the morning, and at five in the afternoon, and at night drinking upon it six spoonfuls of the following Infusion. Take of the Roots of Elecampane, Masterwort, Angelica and Gentian, each half an ounce, of the Leaves of roman Wormwood, white Horehound, the lesser Centaury, and Calaminth, each one handful, of Juniper Berries one ounce: Cut them small, and infuse them in five pints of Canary-Wine, let them stand in Infusion, and strain them only as you use them. Through the whole course of Corroboratives purging must not be used, for every Evacuation spoils what the Corroborative has done. [Page 358](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/337:5.6?vid=65404) CHAP. XCVII. Of Hysterick and Hypochondriack Diseases. THese Diseases, if I calculate right, are the most frequent of all chronical Diseases; and as Fevers, with those Diseases that appertain to them, if they are compared with chronical, taken altogether, make two thirds; so, Hysterical Diseases, at least those that go under that Name, are half the remaining third, that is, chronical Diseases are half Hysterick; for very few Women, which Sex contains half of grown People, are wholly free from all kinds of Hysterick Diseases, if you except those who being accustomed to Labour live hardly; yea, many of those Men that live sedentary Lives, and are wont to study hard, are afflicted with the same Disease; and though, heretofore, Hysterical Symptoms were always reckoned to proceed from a vicious Womb, yet if we compare Hypochondriack Symptoms, which were supposed to proceed from Obstructions of the Spleen or Bowels, or from some other I know not what Obstructions, with Women's Hysterick Symptoms, an Egg is scarce more like an Egg, than these Symptoms are like one another in all respects: But it must be confessed, that Women are much more subject to this kind of Disease, than Men. This Disease is not only frequent, but so wonderfully various, that it resembles almost all the Diseases poor Mortals are subject to; for whatever Part it seats it self in, it presently produces such Symptoms as belong to it; and unless the Physician be very sagacious and very skilful, he will be mistaken, and suppose that tese Symptoms proceed from an essential Disease of this or that part, and not from an histerical Distemper. Sometimes, for instance, it possesses the Head, and occasions an Apoplexy, which also ends in an Hemiplgy, and this seizes Women very often after Delivery; or it is occasioned by hard Labour, or some violent commotion of the Mind. [Page 359](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/338:5.6?vid=65404)Sometimes it produces violent Convulsions very like an Epilepsy, the Belly and Bowels swelling toward the Throat, the Patient strugling so violently, that though at other times her Strength is but ordinary, she now can scarce be held by all the strength of the By-standers, uttering some odd and inarticulat sounds, and striking her Breast. Women who are accustomed to this Disease, commonly called Mother-fits, are generally extraordinary Sanguine, and have a habit of Body almost like that of a Virago. Sometimes it possesses the outward part of the Head, betwixt the Pericranium and Skull, causing violent Pain continually fixed in one part, which may be covered with the top of your Thumb, and violent Vomiting accompanies this Pain: I call this Species Clavus Hystericus, chiefly afflicting those that have the Green-sickness. Sometimes falling upon the vital Parts, it occasions so great a palpitation of the Heart, that the Women who are afflicted with it, may verily believe that the By-standers may hear the sound of the Heart thumping upon the Ribs. This kind chiefly afflicts those that are of a thin habit of Body and of a weak Constitution, and who look almost tabid; and also, young Maids that have the Green-sickness. Sometimes the Patient coughs almost without intermission, but expectorates nothing. This kind of Hysterick-cough is very rare, and chiefly invades Women that abound in Flegm. Sometimes rushing violently upon the Colon, and the Region under the Scrobiculum Cordis, it occasions violent Pain, much like the Iliack Passion, and the Woman vomits exceedingly, ejecting a certain green Matter somewhat like that they call porraceous Bile; and sometimes Matter of an unusual colour: And often after the Sick have been almost destroyed by the said Pain, which would tire a stoical Apathy, and reachings to vomit for many days, at length it is carried off by the Jaundice tincturing the superficies of the Body like Saffron. Moreover, the Sick is oppressed by an anguish of mind, and wholly despairs of recovery, with dejection of mind, and as it were a certain desperation; as certainly accompanies [Page 360](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/339:5.6?vid=65404) this kind of Hysterick Disease, as the Pain and Vomiting above-mentioned. This kind chiefly invades those that are of a lax and crude habit of Body, and those that have suffered much in bringing forth great Children. When this Disease falls upon one of the Kidnies, it plainly represents, by the Pain it causes there, a Nephritick Fit; and not only by that sort of Pain, and by the place it rages in, but also by the violent Vomitings that accompanies it, and for that sometimes the Pain extends it self through the passage of the Ureter; so that it is very difficult to know whether these Symptoms proceed from the Stone, or from some Hysterick Disease; unless, perchance, some unlucky Accident disturbing the Woman's mind, a little before she was taken ill of the vomiting of green Matter, shews that the Symptoms rather proceed from an Hysterick Disease, than from the Stone. Nor is the Bladder free from this false Symptom; for it does not only cause Pain there, but it also stops the Urine, just as if there were a Stone, whereas there is none: But this last kind seizing the Bladder, happens very seldom. That which resembles the Stone in the Kidnies is not so rare; both use to invade those Women, who are much weak'ned by Hysterick Fits coming frequently, and whose health of Body is much impaired. Sometimes falling upon the Stomach it causes cntinual Vomiting, and sometimes a Looseness, when it is setled upon the Guts. But no Pain accompanies either of these Symptoms, though oftentimes in both the green Humours appear. Both these kinds are familiar with those that are weak'ned by the Hysterick Fits coming frequently. And as this Disease afflicts almost all the inward Parts, so sometimes it seizes all the outward Parts, and the musculous Flesh occasioning Pain, and sometimes a Tumour in the Jaws, Shoulders, Hands, Thighs, Legs, in which kind that Tumour which swells the Legs, is more conspicuous than the rest. But whereas in Hydropical Swellings, these two things may be always taken notice of, viz. That the swelling is most in the Evening, and that the Finger prest upon it, leaves a pit: In this [Page 361](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/340:5.6?vid=65404) Tumour the swelling is most in the Morning, nor does it yield to the Finger, or leave any mark behind it, and for the most part it only swells one of the Legs. As to other things, if you mind the largeness of it, or its superficies, it is so very like Hydropical Swellings, that the Patient can scarce be brought to believe that it is any other Disease; nor can the Teeth free themselves from the assaults of this Disease, tho' they are not hollow, and tho' there is no apparent defluxion that may occasion the Pain, yet it is no whit gentler, nor shorter, nor easier cured. But these Pains and Tumours which afflict the outward Parts, chiefly seize those Women that are in a manner quite destroyed by a long series of Hysterick Fits, and by the force of them. But among all the Torments of this Disease, there is none so common as a pain in the Back, which most certainly all feel, how little soever they are afflicted with this Disease. Moreover, this is common to the foresaid Pains, that the place on which they were, will not bear touching after they are gone; but is tender, and akes just as if it were soundly beaten: But this tenderness goes off by degrees. And this is worth observing, That often a notable Cold of the external Parts makes way for these Symptoms, which for the most part does not go off till the Fit ends; which Cold I have observed is almost like that by which a Carcass grows stiff, yet the Pulse is good. And moreover, all Hysterick Women which I have hitherto taken care of, complain of a dejection and sinking of the Spirits; and when they would shew the place where the sinking of the Spirits is, they point to the region of the Lungs. Lastly, every one knows that Hysterick Women sometimes laugh excessively, and sometimes cry as much, without any real cause for either. But among all the Symptoms that accompany this Disease, this is the most proper, and almost inseparable, viz. a Urine as clear as Rock-water, and this Hysterick Women evacuate plentifully; which I find, by diligent Enquiry, is in almost all the pathognomonic sign of this Disease, which we call Hysterick in Women, and Hypochondriack [Page 362](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/341:5.6?vid=65404) in Men; and I have sometimes observed in Men, that presently after making Water of a Citron colour (yea, almost the next moment) being suddenly seized with some violent commotion of the Mind, they make Water as clear as Cristal, and in a great quantity with a continued violent Stream, and continue ill till the Urine comes to its wonted colour, and then the Fit goes off. And it happens to all Hysterical and Hypochondriacal People, that sometimes they belch up ill Fumes as often as they eat, tho' they eat only moderately, and according as they have an Appetite; and sometimes the Wind that comes from the Stomach is sower just like Vinegar. Nor are they unhappy upon this account only, viz. That their Bodies are so ill affected, and as it were tottering like ruined Houses just about to fall; for their Minds are more diseased than their Bodies, and an incureable desperation is mixed with the very nature of the Disease; and what the Roman Orator said of the Superstitions exactly agrees with these melancholy People, Sleep, says he, seems to be a Refuge to the Laborious and Careful, but from thence Cares and Fears arise, whilst only Funerals and Apparitions of their deceased Friends are represented in Dreams, and they are so tormented in Body and Mind that one would think their Lives were a Purgatory, wherein they were to purifie themselves, and to expiate Crimes committed in some other State. Nor does this happen only to mad People, but also to those who, if you except those Impetuosities of Mind, are very prudent and judicious, and who much excel for deep thought and wisdom in Speech, others, who's Minds were never excited by these Provokments to thinking. But this dreadful condition of Mind which we have above described, seizes on those only that have much and a long while conflicted with this Disease, and have been at length wholly vanquished by it, especially if Adversity, care or trouble of Mind or hard Study, or the like, join'd with an ill habit of Body, have added Oil to the Flame. [Page 363](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/342:5.6?vid=65404)A day would scarce be sufficient to reckon up all the Symptoms belonging to Hysterick Diseases, and I think Democritus reckoned pretty right (though he mistook the cause of the Disease) when he said in an Epistle to Hippocrates, That the Womb was the cause of six hundred Miseries, and of innumerable Calamities. The procatarctick or external causes of this Disease are either violent motions of the Body, or which is much oftener, vehement commotions of the Mind. But to these disorders of the Mind, which are usually the occasions of this Disease, is to be added emptiness of the Stomach, by reason of long Fasting, immoderate Bleeding, and a Vomit or Purge that works too much. As to the internal, efficient Causes, in my Opinion those Diseases which we call Hysterick in Women, and Hypochondriack in Men, proceed from a confusion of the Spirits. The origin and antecedent cause of this confusion, is a weak constitution of the Spirits. In order to the Cure, I order, That 8 ounces of Blood be taken from the right Arm, and that the following Plaster be applied to the Navel. Take of Galbanum, dissolv'd in tincture of Castor and strain'd, three drachms, of Tacamacha two drachms; mix them, make a Plaster. The next Morning, let her make use of the following Pills. Take of the Pill Coch. major two scruples, of Castor powder'd two grains, of peruvian Balsam four drops; make four Pills, let her take them at five in the Morning, and sleep after them. Repeat them twice or thrice every Morning, or every other Morning, according to their operation and the strength of the Patient. Take of the Waters of black Cherries, Rue and compound Briony, each three ounces; of Castor, tyed up in a Rag and hanged in the Glass, half a dram; of fine Sugar a sufficient quanity, make a Julep, whereof let her take four or five Spoonfuls when she is faint, dropping into the first Dose, if the Fit is violent, twenty drops of the Spirit of Hartshorn. [Page 364](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/343:5.6?vid=65404)After the Purging Pills just described are taken, let her use the following. Take of the filings of Steel eight grains, with a sufficient quantity of extract of Wormwood; make two Pills, let her take them early in the Morning, and at five in the Afternoon, for thirty days, drinking upon them a draught of Wormwood-wine. Or, if she like a Bolus better. Take of conserve of Roman-wormwood, and of the conserve of the yellow rind of Oranges, each one ounce; of candied Angelica, and Nutmogs candied, and of Venice Treacle, each half an ounce; of candied Ginger two drachms; make an Electuary, with a sufficient quantity of Syruy of Oranges. Take of this Electuary one drachm and an half, of the filings of Steel well rubbed eight grains; make a Bolus, with a sufficient quantity of Syrup of Oranges, to be taken in the Morning, and at five in the Evening, drinking upon it a Glass of Wormood-wine. Take of choice Myrrh and Galbanum, each one drachm and an half; of Castor fifteen grains, with a sufficient quantity of Balsam of Peru; make twelve Pills of every drachm. Let her take three every Night, and drink upon them three or four Spoonfuls of compound Briony-water, through the whole course of this Process. But if the Pills last prescribed move the Belly, which sometimes happens in Bodies that are very easily purged, by reason of the Gum that is in them; the following may be used instead of them. Take of Castor one drachm, of volatil Salt of Amber half a drachm, with a sufficient quantity of extract of Rue; make twenty four small Pills: Let her take three every Night. But here you must take notice, That Chalybeats, in whatsoever Form or Dose they are taken, occasion sometimes in Women great disorders both of Body and Mind, and that not only on the first days, which is usual almost in every Body, but also all the time they are taken; in this case, the use of Steel must be interrupted at those times; but Laudanum must be given every [Page 365](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/344:5.6?vid=65404) Night for some time, in some Hysterick Water, that they may better bear it. But when the Symptoms are mild, and it seems that the business may be done without taking Steel, I think it sufficient to bleed and to purge three or four times, and then to give the altering Hysterick Pills beforementioned, Morning and Evening, for ten days; which method seldoms fails, when the Disease is not violent; yea, the Pills alone, bleeding and purging being omitted, oftentimes do a great deal of good. Yet we must take great notice, That some Women, by a certain Ideosyncrasy, so abhor Hysterical Medicines (which give ease in most of the Symptoms of this Disease) that they don't only not receive benefit, but are much injur'd thereby; therefore, they must not be given to such; for Hippocrates says, 'Tis in vain to do any thing contrary to Natures inclination. Which Ideosyncracy is so great and so frequent, that if we have not regard to it, the Lives of the Sick may be hazarded. And so Hysterical Diseases are most commonly cur'd and most Obstructions of Women, especially the Green Sickness; and also, all Suppressions of the Courses. But if the Blood is so very feeble, and the confusion of the Spirits so great, that Stel order'd to be us'd according to the Method prescrib'd, is not sufficient to cure the Disease, the Patient must drink some mineral Waters impregnated with an Iron Mine, such as are Tunbridge, and some others lately found out, for the Chalybeat Vertue of these is better mingl'd with the Blood, by reason of the great quantity that is taken of them, and also because they are more agreeable to Nature, and they cure Diseases more effectually than Iron how much soever exalted by Art. But this is more especially to be observ'd, in drinking of them, that if any Sickness happens that is to be referr'd to Hysterical Symptoms, in this case the Patient must forbear drinking them a day or two, till that Symptom that hinder'd their Passage is quite gone; and it is to be noted, that Purging must be avoided all the time the Patient drinks these Waters. [Page 366](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/345:5.6?vid=65404)But if this Disease, by reason of its Obstinacy does not yield to Steel-waters, the Sick must go to the Bath, and when she has used them inwardly three mornings following, the next day let her go into the Bath, and the day following let her drink them again, and so let her do by turns for two months; for in these and in others, of what kind soever they are, this must be carefully noted, That the Patient must persist in the use of them, not only till she perceives some benefit, but till she is quite well, that the Symptoms may not return again in a short time. Venice-Treacle alone if it is us'd often and a long while, is a great Remedy in this Disease; and not only in this but in very many other Diseases, that proceed from want of heat, or concoction or digestion, 'tis perhaps the most powerful that has been hitherto known. Spanish Wine medicated with Gentian, Angelica, Wormwood, Centory and other Corroboratives infus'd in it, does a great deal of good, some Spoonfuls of it being taken thrice a day, if the Woman be not of a thin and cholerick habit of Body; and truly, a large Draught of Spanish Wine by it self taken at Bed-time for some Nights, by my Advice, has been very beneficial to some Women; for by it the habit of the whole Body was render'd stronger, and they who before were Cachectical, became fresh-colour'd and brisk. Moreover, sometimes we find that the Peruvian Bark wonderfully comforts and invigorates the Blood and Spirits, a Scruple of it being taken Morning and Evening for some Weeks; but it succeeds best in that kind of Hysterick Diseases, wherein VVomen are afflicted with Convulsions. But if any of the Remedies above-mentioned don't agree well, which often happens in cholerick and thin Constitutions, then a Milk-diet may be us'd, for some VVomen (which one wou'd wonder at at first) that have been conflicted a long while with Hysterick Diseases, and even such as have frustrated all the endeavours of Physicians, yet have recover'd by dieting themselves for some time only with Milk; and especially those that labour with that Disease, I call an Hysterick Cholick; which can't be appeas'd by any thing but Narcoticks, to which, repeated by Intervals, [Page 367](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/346:5.6?vid=65404) the VVomen are much accustom'd, the Pain returning assoon as the Vertue of the Anodyne fades. But nothing of all I have hitherto mention'd does so much comfort and strengthen the Blood and Spirits as riding on Horse-back every Day for a long while, but though it may be inconvenient for Women that are accustom'd to a slothful and delicate way of living, for they may be injur'd by Motion, especially at the beginning, yet 'tis very proper for Men, and soonest recovers their Health. One of our Right Reverend Bishops, famous for Prudence and Learning, having studied too hard a long while, fell at length into an hypochondriac Disease, which afflicting him a long Time vitiated all the Ferments of the Body, and wholly subverted the Concoctions; he had passed through long Courses of Steel more than once, and had tried almost all mineral Waters, with Purging often repeated, and antiscorbuticks of all kinds, and very many testaceous Powders, which are reckoned proper to sweeten the Blood, and so being in a manner quite worn out, partly by the Disease, and partly by Physick, used continually for so many Years, he was at length seized with a colliquative Loosness, which is wont to be the forerunner of Death in Consumptions, and other chronical Diseases, when the Digestions are wholly destroy'd. At length he advised with me; I presently considered that there was no more room for Medicine, he having taken so many already without any Relief; for which reason I persuaded him to ride on Horse-back, and that first he should take such a small Journey as was agreeable to his weak condition. Had he not been a very judicious Man, and one that weighed things well, he would not have been persuaded so much as to have tryed such a kind of Exercise: I intreated him to persist in it daily, till in his own Opinion he was well, going daily furthur and further, till at length he went so many miles in a Day as prudent and moderate Travellers, that go a long Journey upon Business, use to do, without any regard to Meat, Drink or the Weather: But that he should take every thing as it happened: To be short, he continued this Method, increasing his Journies by degrees, till at length he rode [Page 368](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/347:5.6?vid=65404) twenty or thirty miles daily; and when he found himself much better in few Days, being encouraged with such wonderful Success, he continued this course a pretty many Months; in which Time, as he told me, he rode many thousand Miles, till at length he did not only recover, but also gained a strong and brisk habit of Body. This is the general way of Curing this Disease, which is applied to the original Cause, viz. the weak Crasis of the Blood, and so is to be used only when the fit is off: Therefore as often as the Fit invades, joined with any one of the foresaid Symptoms, if the Disease be such, or so great an one, that it will not bear a Truce, till it may be cured by Medicines that corroborate the Blood and Spirits, we must presently make use of hysterick Remedies, which by their strong and offensive Smell recal the exorbitant and deserting Spirits to their proper Stations, whether they are taken inwardly, or smell'd to, or outwardly applied: Such are Assa Foetida, Galbanum, Castor, Spirit of Sal Armoniack, and lastly, whatever has a very ungrateful and offensive smell. In the next place, you must take notice, that if some intollerable Pain accompanies the Fit, in whatever part it is; or violent Vomiting or a Loosness, than besides the Hystericks above-mentioned, Laudanum must be used, which only is able to restrain these Symptoms. But in quieting the Pains, which Vomiting occasions, we must take great care that they are not mitigated either by Laudanum, or any other Paregorick, before due Evacuations have been made, unless they almost exceed all human Patience. First, because sometimes there is so great a quantity of Blood and Humours heap'd up (especially in sanguine Women, and in Men of a proper Habit) that is able to withstand the Operation of the most effectual Narcotick, though it be often repeated, and therefore in such Blood must necessarily be evacuated from the Veins of the Arm, and a Purge must be given before we come to use Laudanum; for when these things are duly performed, that which before given in a large Dose would do no good, does now [Page 369](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/348:5.6?vid=65404) perform the Business in a moderate Dose; and then because I have found by frequent Experience, that when the Sick has been accustomed by little and little to Laudanum, and has not been duly evacuated before she was forced, by reason of the return of the Pain presently after the Vertue of the Medicine vanished, to take a Paregorick again, and so daily for some Years, the Dose being sometimes by degrees increased, so that at last they can by no means abstain from Laudanum, though thereby all the Digestions are vitiated, and the natural Functions weakned; though I do not think that the use of Laudanum does immediately hurt the Brain, or Nerves, or the animal Faculties: Therefore I judge and speak what I have found, That Evacuation ought to go before Anodynes, viz. in Virago's, and in Women that abound with Blood, a Vein must be opened, and the Body purged, especially if they have been lately seized with the Fit: But if weak Women, and those of a quite contrary Constitution, labour with such a Fit and Pain, and have been not long ago afflicted with it, it will be sufficient to cleanse their Stomachs with a gallon of Posset-drink, more or less, taken in and ejected by Vomit, and then to give a large Dose of Venice Treacle and a few Spoonfuls of some Spirituous Liquor, that is pleasing to the taste, with a few Drops of Liquid Laudanum to be taken presently after it. But if the Sick has vomited a great while before the Physician was called, and there is danger, lest by further Provocation, by Emeticks, the Spirits should be put in a rage, and the Sick too much weakned: In this case you must give Laudanum without delay, and such a Dose that is not only suitable to the Violence and Duration of the Symptom, but such an one as is sufficient to vanquish it. But here two things are to be chiefly noted; First That when you have once begun to use Laudanum after due and necessary Evacuations, it must be taken in that Dose, and often repeated till the Symptom is quite conquered; only such a space must be betwixt each Dose, that we may know what the former has done before we give another: And then when we treat the [Page 370](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/349:5.6?vid=65404) Disease with Laudanum, we must do nothing else, and nothing must be evacuated, for the gentlest Glister of Milk and Sugar is sufficient to spoil whatever has been repaired by the Paregoric, and to occasion the return of the Vomiting and Pain. But though the Pains above-mentioned, as we have said, are apt to overcome the Vertue of the Anodyne, yet violent Vomiting indicates the largest Dose of it, and that it should be very often repeated; for by the inverted peristaltick Motion of the Stomach (by which that which is contained in it ought to be carried downwards) the Paregorick is ejected through the Oesophagus, before it can do any good, unless after every time the Sick vomits the Narcotick be given afresh, and chiefly in a solid form, or if it be given in a Liquor the Vehicle must be so small, as that it must but just wet the Stomach, so that by reason of the small quantity of the Matter it cannot be cast up. For instance, some Drops of liquid Laudanum in one spoonful of strong Cinnamon-Water, or the like; and the Sick must be admonished to keep her self quiet, presently after taking the Laudanum, and that she keep her Head, as much as possible, immoveable, for the smallest motion of the Head provokes Vomiting more than any thing else, and then the Medicine, just taken, is ejected; and when the Vomiting ceases, and is, as it were, tamed, it is expedient to give an Anodyne morning and evening for a few days, to prevent a Relapse, which also ought to be observed after a loosness, or an hysterick Pain taken off by a Narcotick; and so at length by this method we may readily cure the symptomatick Pain and Vomiting, whereby, because they are very often like other Diseases, Physicians are easier imposed upon than by any other Symptoms whatever. [Page 371](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/350:5.6?vid=65404) CHAP. XCVIII. Of an Inflammation in the Womb. AN Inflammation of the Womb is a Swelling of that Part, from Blood poured upon it. The Inflammation either possesses all the Womb, or a part of it; and it is occasioned either by pure Blood, and then it is called simply a Phlegmon, or it is mixed with Choler, or with Flegm or Melancholy. The diagnostick Signs are a Swelling, Heat and Pain in the region of the Womb, with a continual Fever. But because the right-Gut and the Bladder possess the same region, therefore an Inflammation of the Womb must be distinguished by other Signs, as by a Suppression or Diminution of the Courses, the pale or yellow Colour of them, and by the Pain in Evacuation of them, and when the Courses are gon off, by a fetid Itchor that moistens the Privities, the inward Mouth of it will appear swell'd, drawn back and painful, and the Neck will be red and inflamed. If all the Womb be inflamed, all the Symptoms will be more violent; if the Inflammation be most upon the Neck of the Womb, the Heat and Pain will be extended most to the Croins and Privities. If the forepart be most afflicted, the Bladder will most sympathise: If the hinder part be most afflicted, the right Gut will most sympathise, and the Pain will stretch it self to the Loins: If the right part or the left part be inflamed, the Swelling and Pain will appear about either Groin, and the Leg of the same Side will have a Weight upon it. The Signs of the Causes are to be known in the following manner: If the Inflammation be occasioned by pure Blood, all the Symptoms will be gentle; but if Choler be mixed with it, the Fever will be high, and all the Symptoms violent; but if the Blood be flegmatic or melancholy, the Fever is not so acute, but more lasting and obstinate: Also the Signs of the Humor [Page 372](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/351:5.6?vid=65404) predominating in the Body are to be referred to the Diagnostick. If the Inflammation tends to suppuration, the Pain and Fever increases, and there are Shiverings which come most commonly about Evening, and all the rest of the Symptoms are increased. When Suppuration is made they all abate, but the Tumor is more increased, whereby the Belly, and sometimes the Urine are suppressed. But if the Inflammation is discussed without Suppuration, the Tumor is lessened, and the Symptoms abate. Lastly, If it degenerate into a Scirrhus, the Fever and Pain, and the rest of the Symptoms lessen, but the Swelling grows hard, and a weight remains, not only in the Womb but also in the circumjacent Parts; so that the Sick moves difficultly. As to the Prognostick, this Disease is very dangerous, and most commonly deadly, for the Inflammation easily turns to a Gangrene. As to the Cure of this Disease, Revulsion and Derivation must be made of the Flux of Blood to the Womb. And it must be repelled from thence, and that which has flow'd to the part must be resolved, and if the Tumor tends to suppuration, it must be furthered, and the Abscess being broken, the Matter must be evacuated, which may be done by the following Remedies. An emollient and cooling Glister being first given, the Sick must be blooded in the Arm; and it must be repeated twice, thrice or four times, according to the strength of the Patient, and the greatness of the Inflammation. After sufficient revulsion, and the increase of the Disease being over, and when there is no more fear of the fluxion, the lower Veins must be opened for derivation from the Part affected. But as long as there is any Indication for revulsion, it is safest to open the Veins of the Arm. And for revulsion, Frictions and Ligatures of the upper Parts are proper, and Cupping-glasses applied to the Shoulders, Back and Loins. [Page 373](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/352:5.6?vid=65404)If vitious Humours, especially Cholerick, abound in the Body, which are, as it were, a Vehicle for other Humours in the Flux, they are to be evacuated by gentle Medicines; as with Syrup of Roses, Manna and Rhubarb, or with lenitive Electuary. By reason of the Fever, cooling Medicines are to be used; as Juleps and Emulsions; if there be great Watching, Pain or Restlesness, Narcoticks may be mingled with them, or they may be given apart. After the first evacuation Topicks may be applied to the Belly, betwixt the Navel and the Pubes, or about the Reins; first, things that cool and repel in the form of a Liniment, Epithem or Cataplasm. A Liniment may be made of Oyl of Roses wash'd in Vineger, or with Ointment of Roses. An Epithem may be made of Waters, or of a Decoction of Plantain, Sorrel, Night-shade, of the tops of white Poppies and of Roses, adding to them a little Bole-armenick, Dragon's-blood, or sealed Earth. A Cataplasm may be made of Crums of Bread boiled in Milk, to which may be added a little Oil of Roses the Juice of Henbane or of Night-shade, with the yolks of Eggs, or of the Meal of Barly; of the Seeds of Flax or of Fenugreek, with Oil of Roses; to which also may be added, the Plants above-mentioned bruised. Injections may be made for the Womb, in the following manner. Take of the leaves of Plantain, Water-lillies, Night-shade and Endive, each one handful; of red Roses, two pugils: Boyl them till a third is consumed, and add to them one ounce of Oyl of Mirtles, and half an ounce of Vineger; make an Injection. Pessaries for the Womb may be made of the same Herbs bruised, and with Oyl of Roses and Vineger. But you must not use repelling and cooling things too long, lest the Tumor grow hard, and turn to a Scirrhus; therefore, things that mollify and dissolve, must be mixed with Repellents, with this caution, viz. That the farther the Inflammation is from the beginning, the greater must be the quantity of the things that digest: To the fore-mentioned Remedies may be Marsh-mallows, Mugwort, Fenugreek, Camomile and Melilot; the quantity of them being increased or diminished as there seems occasion. In the mean time if the Belly be hard, it must be loosened by things that purge gently; and cooling Glisters frequently injected, do much good in qualifying the Inflammation, the Womb lying upon the right Gut. But the quantity of them must be very small, that they may be the longer retained. Take of the Roots of Marsh-mallows one ounce, of the leaves of Mallows, Violets and Lettice, each one handful, of Night-shade half an handful, of the flowers of Violets and red Roses, each one pugil, of acid Prunes number ten; boyl them in Barly-water; to six ounces of the strained Liquor, add three ounces of Oyl of Roses; make a Glister. If the pain be very violent, to the foresaid Glister may be added yolks of Eggs, Hens grease, Woman's milk, the mucilages of the Seeds of Fenugreek, Flax o Mallows, and a little Opium, and a little Saffron. Injections may be also made for the Womb, of Goats or Sheeps milk with Opium or Saffron, each Grains three or four, with a little Rose-water. Or to the Pessaries, may be added a moderate quantity of Opium with a little Saffron, yolks of Eggs, and Oyl of Roses; or Pessaries may be made of Philonium Romanum with Cotton, or an anodyne Fomentation may be prepared in the following manner. Take of Marsh-mallows with the roots, of Mallows and Violets, each one handful; of Camomile, Melilot and Roses, each one pugil; boil them for a fomentation The Disease decreasing, Purging must be repeated with gentle Catharticks; but if it tend to resolution, which may be known by a remission of the Symptoms, and by a lesser weight in the part, Discutients must be added in larger a quantity to the foresaid Remedies; or make the following Cataplasm. Take of the Powder of the roots of Marsh-mallows one ounce, of the flowers of Melilot and Camomile, each two drachms, of the leaves of Mugwort powder'd, of [Page 375](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/354:5.6?vid=65404) the Meal of Barly and Beans, each half an ounce; boil them a little in rough Wine, add to them of fresh Lard, of the Oils of Camomile and of white Lillies, each one ounce; make a Cataplasm. A dissolving fomentation or bath is here also of use. If the Tumor cannot be dissolved, but tends to supparation, it must be furthered by the following Cataplasm. Take of the powder of the roots of Marsh-mallows, of the flowers of Camomile and Melilot, of the Meal of Linseeds, Fenugreek-seeds, each one ounce, of fat Figs number eight; boil them to the consistence of a Cataplasm; then add of the yolks of Eggs number four, of Saffron ten grains, of Oil of Lillies and fresh Butter each one ounce; make a Cataplasm. The Pus being made, which may be known by the remission of the heat and pain, and by its loating when it is touched, the breaking of the abscess must be endeavoured by the motion of the Body, Sneazing, Coughing, by applying Cupping-glasses, by cleansing and attenuating Injections, or by Pessaries that have a faculty of breaking Tumors. For instance, Take of Goose-fat half an ounce, of Turpentine two drachms; of the powder of the seeds of Rue, and of Orris-root, each half a drachm; mix them, and make a Pessary. The Abscess being broken, we must endeavour to cleanse and heal the Ulcer; as shall be shewed in the following Chapter. CHAP XCIX. Of an lcer in the Womb. AN Ulcer follows an Inflammation of the Womb suppurated; it also proceeds from other causes, viz. from whatever corrodes the Womb. Therefore, the causes of it are an Abscess broken, acrid Humours flowing to the Womb, acrid and [Page Medicines injected, or taken inwardly, as Cantharides. The antecedent causes are all those things that occasion an Inflammation, as hard Labour, violent and ungovernable Copulation, acrid and long Whites, Wounds, Falls, Contusions; but especially a virulent Gonorrhaea, and the French Pox, the Contagion whereof is easily communicated to the Womb, and the neck of it. The differences are to be sought for from the Place, Magnitude, Figure and Complication with other Diseases. The diagnostick Signs are a Pain and Gnawing, and the evacuation of purulent Matter. The cure of the Ulcer must be performed by stoping the defluxion of acrid Humours, and by cleansing and conglutinating the Ulcer. And first, if the Body be Plethorick, or if the Ulcer be accompanied with an Inflammation, a Vein must be opened in the Arm, and bleeding must be repeated as often as there is danger of a new fluxion, especially at the time of the Courses, to lessen them, which are wont to increase the matter of the Ulcer, and to promote the flux of other Humours to the Womb. Purging is also very necessary to cleanse the Body from ill Humours; but it ought to consist of gentle Catharticks, as of Sena, Rhubarb, Tamarinds, Myrabolanes, and the like, which must be often repeated, that the vitious Humours may be diverted; and this is of so great moment, that Forestus says, That a noble Matron was cured of an Ulcer of the Womb, by taking every fourth day five ounces of the decoction of Sena, Dodder of Thym, red Roses, Indian Myrabolanes sweetned with Sugar, and by injecting a cleansing decoction into the Womb. For common use, a magisterial Syrup may be made in the following manner. Take of the roots of Comfry, and of fresh Polypody of the Oak, each one ounce; of the Bark of dried Citron six drachms; of the leaves of Plantain, Periwinkle, each one handful; of Liquorish rasped, and of Raisins of the Sun stoned, each one ounce; of Sena cleansed six drachms; of the [Page 377](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/356:5.6?vid=65404) of bruised, two ounces; of Agarick fresh trochiscated, and tyed up in a Rag, ten drachms; of the seeds of Anise and Melon, each three drachms; of the Cordial Flowers of Rosemary and of Dodder, each one pugil; make a decoction of all, in a part of which infuse half an ounce of choice Rhubarb, and one drachm of Cinnamon; in a pint and an half of the strained Liquor, dissolve three ounces of Syrup of Roses solutive, and a sufficient quantity of Sugar; boil them well and make a Syrup, whereof let her take two or three ounces twice or thrice in a month, with a decoction of Agrimony and Plantain, or with an infusion of Rhubarb in Endive water. If the sick vomits easily, a Vomit is most useful, for it makes a revulsion of the Humours from the Womb; and the days the sick does not purge a vulnerary decoction must be used a long while, made in the following manner. Take of the leaves of Agrimony, Knot-grass, Burnet and Plantain, each half a handful; of the roots of China three drachms, of Coriander-seed one drachm, of Raisins half an ounce, of red Sanders one scruple; boil them in Chicken Broath, strain it. Let the sick take of it morning and evening. Or, Take of the leaves of Mugwort, Plantain, Yarrow, each one handful; Rhaponticum half an ounce, of the seeds of Nettles one drachm; boil them in a measure of white Wine, and sweeten it with Sugar; let the sick take two or three ounces in a morning. If the Fever be violent, and if a great quantity of Sanies be evacuated, Whey is very proper; half a pint or more being taken in a morning, with a little Hony of Roses. If the Body begin to waste, and there is a hectick Fever, Asses Milk must be taken, with Sugar of Roses for a whole Month. Sudorificks, there being no Inflammation, or a hot Intemperies may also do good to dry the Ulcer, and to drive the serous Humours towards the habit of the Body. [Page 378](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/357:5.6?vid=65404)Turpentine washed in some proper Water for the Womb, as in Mugwort or Feferfew-water, or in some Water proper for the Ulcer, as Plantain or Rose-water, taken with Sugar of Roses, by Intervals cleanses and heals the Ulcer. Pills of Bdellium taken daily or every other day, are also very good. Take of Bdellium three drachms, of Myrrh and Frankincense, each one drachm; of Sarcocoll, Amber, Storax, and of Myrabolanes, called Chebule, each one drachm; of red Coral two scruples, with syrup of Poppies, make a mass for Pills; to which, when the Pain is violent, may be added a little Opium. Troches of Alkakengi with Opium, may be also used when the pain is violent; and to ease the pain, the same Remedies may be prescribed, which were proposed in an Inflammation of the Womb, for the same Symptom. The following Powder is also very effectual to dry the Ulcer. Take of Acacia and Hypocistis, each one drachm, of Dragon's-blood, white Starch, the roots of Plantain and of round Birthwort, each half a drachm; of Bole armenick one drachm, of Mastich and Sarcocol, each half a drachm; make a fine Powder; the dose is one drachm in Plantain or Rose-water, or in some Chalybeat-water. To cleanse, dry and heal the Ulcer, various Injections are prepared; but they must not be used till the Inflammation is taken off, and till the Pain is eased; and, therefore, upon account of the Inflammation and Acrimony, Emulsions of the cold Seeds, the Whey of Goat's-milk, or the Milk it self, or mixed with the juice of Plantain or Shepherd's purse, may be injected first; if necessity requires, a decoction of Poppy-heads and tops of Mallows may be injected. Some Practitioners say, The Sick may be much relieved by injecting frequently warm Water. The hot Intemperies, and the Pain being quieted, or at least diminished, we must use such things as cleanse, beginning with the gentle, and proceeding by degrees to the stronger. [Page 379](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/358:5.6?vid=65404)The gentle, are Whey with Sugar, a decoction of Barly with Sugar, or Hony of Roses; but simple Hydromel cleanses more. A decoction will be a little stronger made with Barly, Lentils, Beans not excorticated, of the Leaves of Smallage, Plantain and Pellitory, a little Hony of Roses being added. When the Ulcer is very sordid, the following decoction may be used. Take of the roots of Gentian, Rhaponticum, Zedoary, and round Birthwort, each one ounce, of white Wine three pints; boil them to the consumption of a third part; in the strained Liquor, dissolve half a pound of Sugar, and keep it for use. If the Ulcer be very fetid, a little nguentum Aegyptiacum may be added to the decoction. When the Ulcer is well cleansed, we must use such things as dry and consolidat. Take of the roots of Comfry and Bistort, each one ounce, of the leaves of Plantain, Horsetail, Shepherd's-purse, Sanicle, Mouse-ear, Milfoil, each one handful, of red Roses half an handful; boil them in a measure of Water for an injection. The following Sarcotick Powder may be added to it. Take of the roots of Orris, Birthwort and Comfry, each half an ounce, of Myrrh one ounce, of Aloes three drachms; make a Powder, whereof let half an ounce be mingled with every injection. Take of Turpentine washed in Plantain-water, two drachms, dissolve it with Hony and the yolk of an Egg, and mingle it with the Injection. This is very effectual; but is more so, if the sarcotick Powder be also added. Oil of the yolks of Eggs stirred well about in a leaden Mortar, is also very good. Fumes must be used for deep Ulcers, for they penetrate to the bottom of the Womb, and dry the Ulcers. Take of Frankincense, Myrrh, Mastick, Gum-juniper, Labdanum, each one ounce, with a sufficient quantity of Turpentine; make Troches for a Fume. [Page 380](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/359:5.6?vid=65404)When the Ulcer is very obstinat, Cinnabar must be added, which is of excellent use. The Bath-waters have cured Women, when all other Medicines have been ineffectual. Plasters may be also conveniently applied to the Epigaster. If the Ulcer be in the Neck of the Womb, it must be anointed with Liniments, that cleanse and dry. Take of the juice of Smallage two ounces, of hony of Roses one ounce and an half, of Turpentine half an ounce, of the meal of Barly or of Orobus, a sufficient quantity; make a Liniment. Oyntment of Diapompholigos may be also applied, adding to it Frankincense, Mastich, Myrrh, Aloes, according to the condition of the Ulcer: These things cleanse. After you have sufficiently cleansed the Ulcer, you must apply a drying and cicatrizing Ointment. Take of Tutty washed half an ounce, of Lytharge, Ceruss and Sarcocoll, each two drachms, of Oil and Wax a sufficient quantity; make an Ointment. Sometimes the Ulcer penetrates the right Gut, and sometimes the Bladder, which may be known by the Matter evacuated by those Parts. If it flow by the right Gut, lenitive, cleansing and drying Glisters must be injected: But if it flow from the Bladder, gentle and cooling Diureticks must be used, as an Emulsion of the greater cold Seeds, Turpentine and other Remedies prescribed for an Ulcer of the Bladder. If the Ulcer turn to a Fistula, which chiefly happens, when it is opened outwardly towards the Hip, though it may happen in the Womb it self, or in the Neck of it; in this case we must consider, whether it be best to leave the accustomed Passage untouched, through which Nature endeavours to evacuate various Excrements, or to undertake the Cure of it: But if that be thought most proper for the Sick, a Cure that is called palliative must be instituted by Purges frequently repeated, and by sweating twice a year, and by cleansing and strengthening Injections, and by applying over a Plaster of Diapalma, or the like. But if there be any hopes of a [Page 381](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/360:5.6?vid=65404) Cure, the same Remedies must be used which are proper for other Fistula's. If the Ulcer be occasioned by the French Pox, it cannot be cured without an universal Cure; in performing which, the Fumes of Cinnabar received through a Tunnel into the Womb, are peculiarly proper; also, the anointing the inner Parts of the Womb with a mercurial Ointment. In all Ulcers of the Womb, if there be a troublesome itching about the Neck, as it frequently happens, by reason of a defluction of an acrid and salt Humour to the part; a Pessary must be made to qualifie it, dipt in the Ointment of Elecampane with Mercury, or in Aegyptiacum dissolved in Sea or Alum-water, or in fresh Butter, wherein quick Silver has been extinguished; to which must be added Sulphur. CHAP. C. Of the Scirrhus of the Womb. THE signs of a Scirrhus in the Womb are a hardness in the region of it, a sense of weight in the part, especially when the Sick stands, but there is no Fever or Pain, whereby it is distinguish'd from an Inflammation, and if there be any Pain it is small. If it be in the body of the Womb it is easily known by feeling the region of the Pubes, but if it be in the Neck of the Womb it may be touch'd with the Finger; it is distinguish'd from a Mola by the preceding Causes, also because in a Mola the Courses, if they flow, flow disorderly: But in a Scirrhus, if they flow, they keep their order. Also in a Mola, the Breasts are full of Milk, but in a Scirrhus they grow small. As to the Prognostick, every Scirrhus is difficultly cur'd; for great hardness once contracted can scarce be mollified: Moreover the Natural Heat in the part affected with the Scirrhus is very weak, so that it can scarce discuss the gross and almost stony Matter. A great and obstinate Scirrhus occasions at length a Dropsie. [Page 382](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/361:5.6?vid=65404)If a Scirrhus of the Womb be treated with too hot, and too moistening Remedies, it degenerates into a Cancer. The Cure is to be directed to two things, viz. to the antecedent and conjunct cause. By reason of the antecedent Cause, Bleeding must be ordered first in the Arm; if the Disease be not very inveterate: But afterwards in the inferior Veins, especially when the Courses are stopt. The opening of the Hemorrhoidal Veins is also very proper, for they evacuate feculent Blood, and draw from the Womb, by reason of the Communication which they have with it. Purging is also necessary, and it must be repeated by intervals. The Purges must be made of such things as evacuate Melancholy. First you must use such as are gentle, afterwards stronger. But opening Medicines, and such as prepare the Melancholy Humor must be given before Purges, in the Forms of Apozems, Juleps or Broaths, according to the Disposition of the Sick. But besides common Apperitives, chalybeat Medicines must be also used, whereby the great Obstruction in the Womb and other Parts may be dissolved. And that the superfluous Humors may be diverted, Issues should be made in the Legs, and must be continued there till the Courses, which are generally stopt in this Disease, return orderly. For the conjunct Cause emollient and resolving Medicines must be applied outwardly in the following manner. Take of the Roots of Marshmallows, and of Lillies, each two ounces; of the Leaves of Mallows, Violets, Marshmallows, and Bears-breach, each one handful; of the Leaves of Mugword and Calamint, half an handful; of the Seeds of Flax and Fenugreek, each one ounce; of the Flowers of Camomile and Melilot, each one pugil: Make a Decoction, wherewith foment the Region of the Pubes and Groin with a Spunge dipt in it and pressed out. To mollifie more, a Decoction may be made of the Entrails of a Sheep, and the Roots of Briony and wild [Page 383](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/362:5.6?vid=65404) Cucumber may be added: But you must begin with things that are gentle, and proceed by degrees to stronger Of the same Decoction, the Dose of the Simples being increased, a Bath may be made, which is very effectual in this case, and more powerful than the Fomentation. Glisters also and Injections may be made of the same Decoction, and frequently used; whereunto may be added the Oils of Lillies, Camomil and Sweet Almonds. Take of the Oils of Lillies, and of Sweet Almonds, each three ounces; of the Mucilage of the Seeds of Fenugreek, extracted with White-Wine one ounce; of the Fats of Hens, Geese and Ducks, each one ounce and an half; of fresh Butter and of Lard, of each two ounces; with a sufficient quantity of Wax and Turpentine make an Ointment. The following is approved of in all Scirrhus's. Take of Bdellium, Ammoniacum, and Galbanum, each equal parts; beat them in a Mortar with Oil of Ben and Lillies; then add of the Mucilages of the Seeds of Fenugreek, Flax, and of Figs a like quantity; make an Ointment. Of the same Matter, Wax being added, an effectual Plaster may be made, and applied to the region of the Womb behind and before; or Diachylon with Orris may be applied. A Cataplasm may be made of the residue of the Decoction for the foresaid Bath, bruised and pulped, adding to it of the Meal of Fenugreek and Flax-Seeds, each one ounce, of Figs, number six, of the Powder of Orris Root two drachms, of Saffron half a drachm, of hens Fat and Oil of Sweet Almonds, each a sufficient quantity; make a Cataplasm. The Mud of a Sulphurous Bath may be applied instead of a Cataplasm. But these Medicines must be used with great caution, lest the Scirrhus should be hardned; or what is much worse, should degenerate into a Cancer. So that it is best to desist by intervals; and it is to no purpose to use Medicines when the Scirrhus is without Pain, and of a stony nature. [Page 384](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/363:5.6?vid=65404) CHAP. CI. Of a Cancer of the Womb. A Cancer of the Womb is a hard Swelling of the Body or Neck of it, with pricking and lanceing Pain. It is occasioned by black Choler collected in that part, or by a Scirrhus ill cured, which easily degenerates into a Cancer in that part, especially by reason of a great afflux of Blood, which being retained in the Veins near the Scirrhus, and not sufficiently evacuated by the Courses, acquires a malignant quality. It is twofold, either ulcerated or not ulcerated. As long as the Morbific Matter is of lesser Acrimony and Malignity the Cancer does not break; but when the Matter becomes more acrid, it causes an Ulcer. It is easily known by what has been said; for if there be a hard Tumor in the Body or Neck of the Womb, which occasions a pricking and lancing Pain, you may pronounce it cancerous: But it is more evidently distinguished, if it be seen by the Eyes, as when it is in the Neck of the Womb, by the help of a Speculum Matricis, for then an unequal, livid, or black Tumor, encompassed with Branches of Veins will appear: But if it be ulcerated it casts forth a yellow or black Sanies that stinks much, and sometimes Blood, by reason the Veins are corroded which run to it, so that sometimes when a large Vessel is opened, it flows so much that the Life of the Sick is hazarded. There is also a small Fever, Anxiety, Nauseousness, and a Heat of the Privities, and the like. As to the Prognostick, a Cancer is incurable, whether it be ulcerated or not; wherefore seeing a perfect Cure cannot be expected, we must endeavour to hinder the breaking of it, and the increase of it when it is broken, and in both we must qualifie the Violence of the Pain; which may be done by such things as evacuate the whole Body, and by other Remedies which alter [Page 385](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/364:5.6?vid=65404) and evacuate the melancholy Humor, and black Choler, and hinder their Growth: As by bleeding in the Arm, Hemorrhoids, Foot, Potions, Apozems, Juleps, Broath, Milk, Whey, cold mineral Waters, and the like, which are commonly prescribed for any Cancer: But Purging, most especially must be repeated, that the antecedent Cause of the Cancer may be diverted. Topicks must also be applied, which moderately bind and cool without Sharpness; they must especially be used in form of Liniments. Take of Oyl of Myrtles, and of Roses, each two ounces; of the Juice of Night-shade, and of Housleek, each one ounce; stir them all about in a leaden Mortar, with a leaden Pestle, till they grow black; then add of Litharge, and Cerus washed in Scabious Water, each three ounces; of Tutty prepared two drachms, of Camphor ten grains; make a Liniment, wherewith anoint the Part three or four times in a day. Or, Take of the Oils of the Yolks of Eggs and of Roses, each one ounce and an half, of Sacharum Saturni one drachm; stir them about in a leaden Mortar till they change colour. The following is better than the rest, and with it Tumors of the Paps, which are counted cancerous, may be perfectly cured. Take of the Oil of Yolks of Eggs two ounces, of the Juice of Night-shade and Speedwel, or of Housleek, each half an ounce, of crude Mercury two drachms; stir them about in a leaden Mortar, with a leaden Pestle, till they acquire the consistence of a Liniment. The foresaid Liniments are to be put into the Womb with a long Tent, or with a Wax-Candle, wrapt round with a Rag: But Injections may be much easier used. Take of Barly-Water half a pint, of the Waters of Night-shade, and Plantain, each two ounces, of the Water of Speedwel one ounce, of the white Troches of Rhasis two drachms, of Sacharum Saturni one drachm: Make an injection. If the Pain be very violent add to four ounces of the Injection one ounce of the Syrup of Popies. [Page 386](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/365:5.6?vid=65404)Foment the part affected with the Waters of Plantain and Night-shade, or with the decoction of them, whereunto may be added the Leaves of Water-lillies, white Poppies, and red Roses and Camphor; which Decoction may be also frequently injected into the Womb, and it will be much more effectual, if it be stirr'd about in a leaden Mortar, or if Sacharum Saturni be mixed with it. Among Specificks, are commended Frogs wash'd and boil'd, and apply'd instead of a Cataplasm, or a decoction of them injected; also, the decoction or juice of River-crabs injected into the Womb, or Herb-Robert taken inwardly or apply'd. If the Cancer be ulcerated the Dose of the Minerals to be added to the foresaid Linimenss must be increas'd. and the Ashes of River-Crabs may be conveniently added to them; but with the Injections may be mixt the white Troches of Rhasis and Barly-water. If the Mallows, Marsh-mallows, Water-lillies, Poppies, Henbane, green Coriander, Dill, of the seed of Psyllium, Milk, Saffron, and the like, may be used by Intervals, or a Cataplasm made of them may be apply'd, with which also Decoctions, Injections and Baths may be also prepar'd. But all these things are not sometimes sufficient to appease the violent Pain, which sometimes will not suffer the sick to sleep or rest, so that we are forced sometimes to use Narcoticks; and indeed, they are not injurious in this Disease. I knew a Woman that was afflicted with a Cancer in her Breast, who took every Night for four Months two or three Grains of Laudanum, and was much reliev'd by it. If much Blood flow from a Cancer ulcerated, as it often happens, inject into the Womb the juice of Plantain, with a little Frankincense. [Page 387](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/366:5.6?vid=65404) CHAP. CII. Of a Gangrene and Mortification of the Womb. A Gangrene is an incipient Mortification; this Disease is easily generated in a Womans Privities, because those Parts are very moist and soft, and easily receive the Excrements of the whole Body; it often succeeds an Inflammation, Absess or Ulcer ill cured, when the vital heat of the part is suffocated and destroy'd, it is suffocated in great Inflammations, when more Blood flows in, than the innate heat of the part can digest; 'tis destroy'd either by a cold Intemperies that extinguishes it, or by an hot that dissipates and resolves it. An incipient Gangrene is known by an unusual heat that is perceiv'd in the part; a shaking and shivering also invades, with a languid and frequent Pulse, and with Fainting, and because most commonly this Disease is chiefly seated on the Neck of the Womb, and so the part affected may be seen, that appears soft, livid, black and cadaverous, and may be prick'd and cut without feeling, and sends forth a fetid and cadaverous Stink. As to the prognostick, this Disease is very dangerous and most commonly deadly. But it has been observed by many Authors, that the Womb having been corrupted or gangren'd has fallen off of its own accord, or has been cut off, and the Woman has done well. The Cure is to be perform'd by the same Remedies wherewith the Gangrenes of the other parts us'd to be cur'd; if the Gangrene be in the neck of the Womb, or tend towards the external parts, Scarification must be us'd, and a decoction of Wormwood, Myrrh and the like; also Unguentum Aegyptiacum, and a Cataplasm made of the three Meals. Take of the Meals of Barly, Beans and Orobus, each two ounces, of Oxymell, one pint; boil them to the consistenee of a Cataplasm, but it will be more effectual, if you add the Meal of Lupines, Myrrh, Aloes and Wormwood. [Page 388](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/367:5.6?vid=65404)But if it be wholly corrupted it must be cut off, or in a falling of the Womb it must be bound by degrees harder and harder, till at length it falls off, of which Operations Schenkius has collected many Observations. In the whole course of the Cure, Corroboratives must be us'd, and emollient cleansing and cooling Glisters must be frequently injected. CHAP CIII. Of a Dropsie and Inflation of the Womb. THE Inflation and Dropsie are confounded by almost all Authors, but they are to be distinguish'd; for there is a certain Inflation of the Womb which ought not to be call'd a Dropsie, viz. when the Womb is inflated and stretch'd suddenly by Wind rushing in, upon which account a violent pain is occasioned, as it happens in the Cholick; and, therefore, if this Inflation does not last long, it does not deserve the name of a Dropsie; such an one is often in hysterick Diseases. Wherefore, a Dropsie of the Womb is twofold; one from Wind, which is like a Timpany; another, from a watry Humour, which is like the Dropsie of the Belly: Some add a third, from Phlegm. And first of Wind, contain'd in the cavity of the Womb. Sennertus mentions an observation in a Woman, That when she thought she was with Child and about to be deliver'd, evacuated a great quantity of Wind, and her Belly presently asswag'd. He also mentions Observations of great quantities of Water, contain'd in the cavity of the Womb. But Authors testifie, That Water is sometimes contain'd in Bladders, and excluded in them, and sometimes a Dropsie of the Womb is complicated with being with Child, as Fabricius Hildanus relates of his own Wife. As to the Diagnostick of this Disease, many things are to be inquir'd into; first, how this particular Dropsie [Page 389](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/368:5.6?vid=65404) of the Womb may be distinguish'd from an universal Dropsie; secondly, how the Species of it may be known, viz. Whether it proceeds from Wind, Water or Phlegm; thirdly, Whether it arise primarily from the Womb, or be occasion'd by the fault of some other part; fourthly, Whether the peccant Matter be contain'd in the cavity of the VVomb, or within the Membranes of it, or in Bladders; fifthly, How it may be distinguish'd from other Tumours of the VVomb; sixthly, How it may be distinguish'd from being with Child; seventhly, How it may be distinguish'd from a Mola. As to the first Question, 'tis distinguish'd from an universal Dropsie; for that in a Dropsie of the VVomb the Tumour possesses more the bottom of the VVomb, but an universal Dropsie extends equally the whole Belly; besides, in a Dropsie of the VVomb, there is not so soon a paleness and wasting of the whole Body, as in an universal Dropsie, in which also most commonly there is considerable Drought, and dryness of the Tongue, but not in a Dropsie of the VVomb; and also in this, all the Symptoms are much milder, and the hardness when 'tis from VVind, or the fluctuation when 'tis occasion'd by VVater, do not possess so great a space, as in an universal Dropsie. And, lastly, in a Dropsie of the VVomb, wind breaks out by Intervals, or a little water flows out, which manifestly shew, that wind or water is contain'd in it. To the second Question we answer in the following manner: The Species of a Dropsie in the VVomb are thus distinguish'd; if it be occasion'd by wind, the bottom of the Belly sounds, being struck; there are pricking pains in the belly, which sometimes run through the Diaphragm, Stomach, Loins, Navel and other parts; and sometimes the wind does evidently break through the Neck of the VVomb, and the VVomen perceive the VVomb to rise up often to the Stomach like a Ball; breathing is sometimes difficult, the Disease grows worse upon eating or drinking, and they often belch, and are better after it, and they are often troubl'd with Mother-fits: They sometimes perceive a pain in the region of the Hypogaster, so that they can't bear an Hand laid upon it; these Signs are also in an inflation of the [Page 390](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/369:5.6?vid=65404) Womb; but there is this difference, for as we said before, an inflation is but for a small space, but a Dropsie from wind continues much longer. But if a Dropsie of the Womb is occasion'd by Water, that Region appears soft and flaccid, for Wind causes a Tension; there is a greater weight in the part, and a sound as it were of Water floating, and Water sometimes drops from the part. And, lastly, if it proceed from Phlegm, there is a greater softness and flaccidity of the part, which daily increases and afflicts the neighbouring Parts, viz. the Hypogaster, the Pubes Perineum and Loins, with an Oedematous swelling. As to the third Question, if there be Signs of the whole Bodies being ill affected, as by acute or long Fevers, by immoderate Hemorrhagies, by weakness of the Stomach, swellings of the Liver or Spleen, or by other obstinate Diseases of those parts, with which the Dropsie of the Womb began and increased with them, there is good reason to conjecture, That the matter of the Dropsie is receiv'd in those parts; but if when the whole Body is well, such a Tumour happens, and succeeds particular Diseases of the Womb, as hard Labour, suppression of the Courses, or too large an evacuation of them, or Ulcers and Tumors, we may guess that the Dropsie of the Womb proceeds from them. To the fourth Question we answer, That the Matter which is contained in the cavity of the Womb, causes a much greater Tumor than when 'tis contain'd within the Membranes. To the fifth Question we answer, That a Dropsie of the Womb may be distinguish'd from Tumors that proceed from a Phlegmon or an Erysipelas, because in these there is a Fever and Pain upon the least touching; it may be distinguish'd from a Scirrhus or cancerous Tumour, by the hardness that resists the Finger upon touching. To the sixth Question we answer, That when a Woman is with Child, the Tumor is not equal and depress'd, but thrusts it self out above the Navel. Secondly, when a Woman is with Child, after some Months she is better most commonly; but the longer a Dropsie lasts, the worser it grows. Thirdly, in a Woman [Page 391](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/370:5.6?vid=65404) with Child, the motion of the Fetus is manifestly felt, after the third or forth Month, which does not happen in a Dropsie; yet sometimes when a Dropsie arises from Wind, a Palpitation is perceiv'd in the Womb; but it may be easily distinguished from the motion of a Child, because 'tis more equal, and is wont to possess more parts of the Belly. Fourthly, when a Woman is with Child the Breasts swell, but in a Dropsie they grow small. To the seventh Question we answer, That in a Mola there is a weight felt in the Belly, which is not perceiv'd in a Dropsie of the Womb; and when the sick lye on either side, a weight is perceiv'd, as if a Stone roll'd thither. Moreover, in a Mola there are violent Fluxes of the Courses by Intervals, viz. every third of fourth Month, which does not happen in a Dropsy of the Womb. And, lastly, in a Mola the Breasts swell, and have Milk in them sometimes; but there is no such thing in a Dropsie. As to the Prognostick, a simple Inflation of the Womb is not dangerous; but if it continue long, it may turn to a Dropsie. If Wind or Water be contain'd in the cavity of the Womb, 'tis easier cur'd than when 'tis included in the Membranes or in Bladders. The Cure of this Disease is perform'd in a manner by the same Remedies which are propos'd for the Cure of a Dropsie or the Green-sickness, but some things that are peculiar to this Disease must be added. And first, as to bleeding in a recent Disease occasion'd by an obstruction of the Courses, and there being a fulness of Blood, it may be proper, otherwise 'tis injurious. But Purging is always necessary, and it must be often repeated; and after sufficient Purging, Aperitives, Diureticks, and such things as move the Courses must be us'd; to which may be added the following. Take of the Roots of Smallage and Madder, each half an ounce, of the Leaves of Savine, Feverfew and Penny-royal, each one pugil, of the Seeds of Daucus, one drachm; boil them in the Broath of young Pidgeons, and let her take it strain'd in a Morning for many [Page 392](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/371:5.6?vid=65404) days, but before she takes the Broath, let her swallow one of the following Pills. Take of the best Castor, Myrrh and Madder, each half a drachm, of Saffron one scruple, with the juice of Lemons; make nine Pills. After the use of which Medicines violent Exercise must be us'd, that thereby the Excrements bred in the Bowels and in the habit of the Body may be dissipated; and also, all that which is contain'd in the Womb, the Skins being broken by the violence of the exercise. And if the Woman vomit easily, 'twill be proper to vomit her twice a Week, whereby not only the Humors flowing to the Womb may be recall'd and evacuated, but also the Skins sticking to the Womb, and sometimes containing a watry Humour, may perchance be broken, and so the ill Humors may flow out. The following Bolus is very effectual to discuss the Humour contain'd in the Womb. Take of Mineral Borox half a drachm, of Saffron half a scruple, with the juice of Savin; make a Bolus, to be taken twice a week. Sudorificks are also very proper in this Disease, for by them the watry Humours contained in the Womb, or the whole Body, may be discuss'd and evacuated. In the mean while the heat of the Stomach must be strengthened by things taken inwardly, and outwardly apply'd. And outwardly must be apply'd proper topical Remedies to strengthen the Womb, and to discuss the Humors contain'd in it. And first, may be prepar'd Fomentations and Baths, made of a decoction of the Roots of Briony and wild Cucumber, of the Leaves of Dwarf-elder, Mercury-elder, Laurel-borries and Juniper-berries, the Melilote and Rosemary, of which [Page 393](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/372:5.6?vid=65404) may be made Bags to be boil'd in Wine, or the foresaid things may be boil'd in a Lee made of the ashes of the Twigs of a Vine. But that the foremention'd Fomentations may operate the better, they must be applied before and behind, and the Sick ought to sweat, if she can, in the Bed, or in a Bath. In a windy Dropsie dry Fomentations are more beneficial with Bags made of Gromwel, Salt, Cummin and Bran, torrefied in a Frying-Pan, and sprinkled with Wine. After the Fomentation, anoint the Belly with the Oils of Nard, Dill, Rue, Wormwood, and Southernwood, which if they are drawn chymically will be much more effectual. After you have anointed the Belly apply the Plaster of Laurel-berries, or a Cataplasm of Cow-Dung, Sheeps-Dung, of the Seeds of Smallage, Parsly, Cummin and boiled Hony. For the same use is commended the Skin of a Sheep newly kill'd, and sprinkled with hot Wine. Glisters must be also frequently injected made of a Decoction of Wormwood, wild Marjoram, Pennyroyal, Rue, Centory and the like, or with Oils of Rue, Nuts, Dill and White-wine or Mallago-Sack, wherein must be dissolv'd Benedictum Laxativum, Turpentine, Rosemary, Hony and the like. Injections for the Womb may be prepar'd in the following manner, to evacuate the Humours contain'd in it. Take of the Roots of Asarabacca three drachms, of the Leaves of Pennyroyal and Calaminth each one handful, of the Seeds of Savine one pugil, of Mechoacan one drachm, of the seeds of Annise and Cummin, each half a drachm; boil them, and in the strain'd Liquor dissolve of Oil of Orrice and of Elder, each one ounce, in six ounces of the Liquor, and make an Injection. For the same Use Pessaries may be made in the following manner. [Page 394](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/373:5.6?vid=65404)Take of Coloquintida and Mechoacan each one dracm, of Salt of Niter half a scruple, with a sufficient quantity of boil'd Hony, make a Pessary. Or, Take of Elaterium half a drachm, of Figs bruis'd a sufficient quantity, make a Pessary. When the Inflation is occasion'd by Wine, a Fume made of Nutmegs and conveyed through a Tunnel has done much good. And in the same case a Cupping-Glass applied to the Navel, with much Flame, discusses Wind powerfully. But when the Disease is humoral, Issues in the Legs discharge the Filth of the Womb by degrees. The Bath-waters used inwardly and outwardly, are also very good, if the Body be not very hot. For the Pain of the Womb, which often afflicts the Sick in this Disease, Amatus Lucitanus commends the Water or Decoction of Camomel, four or five Ounces, of it being taken at a time. And lastly, if an Inflation happen after Delivery there is no need of any other Cleansing than that of the Womb; but if it does not proceed well, it must be helpt by drawing Pessaries, and by Cupping-Glasses applied to the Thighs, and by other Remedies prescrib'd for the Stoppage of the Courses; and if Wind be the cause, the Fume of Nutmegs above-proposed is very proper. [Page 395](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/374:5.6?vid=65404) CHAP. CIV. Of a Falling of the Womb. FOR the Cure of this Distemper regard must be had to two things; the first is to reduce the Womb into its natural Place, and the second is to strengthen it, and keep it there. For the Execution of the first, which is to reduce it, if the Womb be quite out or turned, the Woman must first of all render her Urine, and a Glister must be given, if it be necessary, to empty the gross Excrements that are in the right-Gut, that so the Reduction may be the easier perform'd; then place her on her Back, with her Hips rais'd a little higher than her Head, and then foment all that is fallen out with a little Wine and Water luke-warm, and with a soft Rag put it up into its proper Place, thrusting back not all at once, but waging it by little and little from side to side, in case this be too painful, because 'tis already too big and swell'd; anoint it with Oil of Almonds, for the more easie reduction of it, being careful as soon as 'tis reduc'd, to wipe off the Oil as much as may be, to avoid a Relapse: But if notwithstanding all this, the Womb cannot be put up, because 'tis very much inflamed and tumified, which happens when it has been a long time so, without the use of necessary means, during which time it is continually moistned with Urine and other Excrements, which contribute very much to its Corruption, in this case there is great danger that 'twill gangrene. Also the second part of this Cure, which consists in the retention of the Womb in its place, and the strengthning of it; It will be done by a convenient situation Let the Woman, for this purpose, keep her self in Bed, on her Back, having her Hips a little raised, her Legs something crossed, and her Thighs join'd together, to prevent the falling of it out again; but the best way is to put up a Pessary into the Neck of the Womb, to [Page 396](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/375:5.6?vid=65404) keep it firm. There are two or three sorts of them made for this purpose, the Figures of them may be seen in Moriceau's Midwifery; see Page 311. Take of Oak-Bark two ounces, boil it in two quarts of Fountain-Water, add at the latter end one ounce of Pomegranate-Peel bruis'd, red Roses, Pomegranate-Flowers, each two handfuls, and then add half a pint of red Wine, strain it, and bath the part affected with Flannels dipt in it, in the Morning, two hours before the Woman rises, and at Night, when she is in Bed; continue the use of it 'till the Symptom is quite gone. CHAP. CV. Of Barrenness. AS to the Cure of Barrenness, too much Fat must be corrected by an orderly Diet, and by convenient Evacuation. Such as are of a robust and manly constitution must be reduc'd to a womanly state by all means; they must forbear strong Meats and Labour, and the Coarses must be forced, and by Bleeding and Purging, and the like, the Habit of the Body must be rendred moist and cold. If from Distortion, Obstruction, Tumors or Ulcers of the Womb, or from its being shut, Barrenness is occasion'd, proper Remedies must be applied. If too hot an Intemperies be the cause, it must be corrected, so must immoderate siccity by Milk and Bathing. But the most frequent Cause of Barrenness is a cold and moist Intemperies of the whole Body, and of the Womb, which the Whites often accompany, and for the Cure in this case, the Whites must be cur'd by the Method prescrib'd in the Chapter for the Whites, and [Page 397](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/376:5.6?vid=65404) the following things must be order'd, which are peculiarly proper for the said Intemperies, which may be varied according to the discretion of the Physician, so as that they may heat more, or dry more, according as Humidity or Frigidity exceeds. And first, the flegmatick Humors, stagnating in the Body, must be evacuated by Medicines that purge, sweat and force Urine; and Revulsion must be made by Issues in the Arms, Neck and Legs, and the principal Parts must be strengthned by Treacle, Mithridate, Confection of Alkermes and the like. Aftewards such things must be us'd as are proper by a specific quality to strengthen the Womb and to help Conception. Take of the Roots Eryngo and Satyrion candied, each one ounce; of green Ginger candied, half an ounce; of Hazel-Nuts, Pine-Nuts and Pistaches, each six drachms; one Nutmeg candied; of the Seeds of Rocket and Cresses each two drachms; of the Ashes of a Bulls-Pisle, of the Reins of Scinks, and of the Raspings of Ivory each one drachm; of Confection of Alkermes, three drachms; of Diambra and sweet Diamoch each one ounce and an half; of Ambergrise half a drachms, with the Syrup of candid Citrons, make an Electuary; let her take the quantity of a Nutmeg at Bed-time, drinking upon it a Glass of good Wine. Some count the Secondine of a Woman dried and powder'd very effectual, one drachm of it being taken. The Seeds of Bishop's Weed is also much commended. Many good Authors affirm, That if a Woman drink six ounces of the Juice of Garden-Sage with a little Salt, the fourth Day of her menstrous Purgation, and a quarter of an hour after has Conversation with her Husband, she will infallibly conceive: And by the use of this Remedy, Aetius says, the Egyptian Women became fruitful after a great Plague. [Page 398](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/377:5.6?vid=65404)Topicks are also to be used, but purging must always go before. Take of Diaphenicon and Hierapicra, each half an ounce; of Turpentine and Mercurial Hony, each one ounce; of Castor one drachm: Mingle them, and reduce them to a convenient consistence, that Pessaries may be made for the Womb. If the Womb abound with a great quantity of Excrements, a stronger Pessary may be made in the following manner: But this injection must be first used. Take of the Leaves of Wormwood, Mugwort, Mercury and Rue, each one handful and an half; of the Pulp of Coloquintida one scruple; of Agarick trochiscated, half a drachm; of Ginger and Myrrh each one scruple Make a Decoction in Water and White-Wine to a Pint, in which dissolve two ounces of Hony of Roses: Let three ounces of this Decoction be injected for three or four days, morning and evening, after the Flux of the courses; and afterwards immit the following Pessary. Take of Hiera picra and of Benedictum Laxativum, each one ounce; of the Pulp of Coloquintida and of Agarick trochiscated, each half a drachm; of Spikenard and of the Seeds of Roman Nigella, and of the Leaves of Savine powder'd, each one drachm: let them be incorporated with Rosemary-Hony, and put them up in Silk, and make Pessaries; let one be put into the Privities at Bed-time, and let it remain there two hours; afterwards let the part be washed with White-wine. To bind, strengthen and dry the Womb the following Medicines may be us'd. Take of round Birthwort, half an ounce; of Wood of Aloes, three drachms; of Cypress-nutts, and of the Roots of Cypress, each two drachms; of sweet-smelling [Page 399](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/378:5.6?vid=65404) Flag, one drachm; of the Leaves of Dittany of Crete, and of Savory and Myrtles, each one handful; of choice Myrrh, Storax Calamit and Benzoin, each two drachms and an half; of the Flowers of Stechas, Rosmary and Marjoram, each one pugil: Boil them in a sufficient quantity of good White-Wine; in a pint of the strain'd Liquor dissolve of the Troches of Alipta moschata two drachms; of Ambergreese and of Musk, each seven grains; of Civet five grains: Make an Injection Morning and Evening, hot, for some Days. Before or after the Injection the following Fume may be used. Take of the Troches of Gallia and Alipta moschata, and Labdanum, each half an ounce; of Wood of Aloes and of Rhodium, each one ounce; of the Seeds of Roman Nigella, Cubebs and Cloves, each four scruples, of Amber and Tacamahaca, each one drachm and an half; of Mace half a drachm: Make a Powder, and with Gum Tragacanth dissolv'd in Orange-flower-water, make Troches; whereof let one or two be cast upon the Coals, and let the Fume be received through a Tunnel. Poor People may be fumed with equal Parts of Myrrh, Franckincense, Wood of Aloes, Storax, Benzoin, Cinnamon and Cloves. After the Injections and Fume the following Pessary may be used. Take of Frankincense and Mastick, each two drachms; of the Troches of Gallia and Alypta Moschata, each four scruples; of the Roots of Bistort, of Cypress-Nuts, shavings of Ivory and of red Roses, each one drachm; of Storax, Benzoin and Labdanum, each two scruples; of sweet-smelling Flag and Cyprus, each half a drachm: Moisten them with Orange-Flower-Water, and with a fine Rag make two Pessaries of a due magnitude, whereof let one be used at Bed-time, the top of it being anointed with Oil of Nutmegs and Civet mixed. [Page 400](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/379:5.6?vid=65404)Before the strengthning Injections and the Fumes, the Sick may use the following Bath. Take of the Roots of Briony, Masterwort, Valerian, Orris, Elecampane; Catminte, Pennyroyal, Mercury, Sage, Lawrel, each four handfuls; the Berries of Lawrel and Juniper, each one ounce: Boil them for a Bath. But sulphurous and Bituminous Baths are the best, as our Bath-waters, and the like, to which such Women fly as to an Asylum. After the Bath and Fume, the Region of the Pubes and Perinoeum must be anointed with the following Liniment. Take of Nard-oil, one ounce and an half; of Oil of Wall-flowers, half an ounce; of Diambra and Dimosh, each one drachm and an half; of liquid Storax, one drachm; of Civet half a scruple; of Musk and Ambergrise, each six grains: with a little white Wax make a Liniment, wherewith anoint the said Parts, and anoint within with Civet, or with natural Indian Balsam. Lastly, let Plasters be applied to the Perineum and the Loins, and let rhem be worn continually. Take of the Plaster for the Matrix four ounces, of the Plaster of Mastick two ounces; of Gum Tachamacha and Caranna, each one ounce; of the Powder of the Roots of Tormentil and Bistort, each three ounces; of the Powder of Myrtles two drachms; of Aromatic Rosat, four scruples; moisten them with Oil of Quinces, and with a drachm of Oil of Nutmegs, spread two Plasters upon Leather, the one round for the Pubes, and the other square for the Loins. [Page 401](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/380:5.6?vid=65404) CHAP. CVI. Of Miscarriage. MIscarriage is the Exclusion of an imperfect or unripe Child, and consequently a Child dead in the Womb is not said abortive till it is excluded; so that whether alive or dead Child be brought forth not being ripe, nor having attained to the just growth in the Womb, it is to be termed abortive. The causes of Abortion are some Internal, some External; the Internal may be reduced to four Heads, viz. to the Humors, to the Child, to the Womb, and to the Disease of the Mother. The Humors may occasion Abortion, when they offend in quantity or quality. They offend in quantity, either by way of excess or defect. The quantity is excessive in a Plethora; for there being more Blood than is requisit to nourish the Fetus, it flows into the Veins of the Womb, and is excluded like the monthly Courses, and so the Child comes away with it. There is too small a quantity of the nutritious Humor when the Child's nourishment is by any means lessened, as by Fasting, whether volunary or forced; and when Women with Child nauseat all sorts of Food, or vomit it up again: Likewise, by reason of a thin Diet in acute Diseases, or by an immoderate evacuation of Blood: Likewise, by reason of extream leanness of the whole Body. In respect of the Child, Abortion may happen if it be over great, so that it cannot by reason of its bulk be contained in the Womb; and for this reason little Women often miscarry, especially if they are married to Men bigger than ordinary, whose Children grow very great, and find not in the Womb a space large enough to contain them, till they come to their perfect growth; [Page 402](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/381:5.6?vid=65404) also, plurality of Children may occasion Abortion, as when two or three, or more, are contained in the Womb at one time. The Womb it self occasions Abortion, if it be not large and capacious enough to widen it self sufficiently according as the Child grows, or if there be any thing preternatural in the Womb, as an Inflammation, a Scirrhus, or Imposthume, or the like; or if the Womb be over moist and slack, so that it cannot contain the Child so well as it ought to do. Abortion comes two ways from the Diseases of the Mother: First, when her Diseases are communicated to the Child, whereby it is killed or so weakned, that it cannot receive due nourishment nor growth; such are continual Fevers and Agues, the French Pox, and many such like. Secondly, when the said Diseases of the Mother cause great Evacuations, or great Commotions of the Body; as large Bleeding from what part of the Body soever, Fluxes of the Belly, grievous Swooning, Falling-sickness, Vomiting and a Tenesmus, which above all other Diseases is wont to cause Abortion. External Causes which further Abortion, do some of them kill the Child, others draw away it's nourishment, and others dissolve those Bands wherewith the Child is fastned to the Womb. The Child is killed by great Commotions of the Mind, as by Anger, Sadness, Frights, and the like; by Meats earnestly longed for, and not obtained; by strong purging Medicines, by things that provoke the Courses, and by those things that expel the Child, and by such things as are reckoned by a Specifick Quality to destroy the Child in the Womb, by abominable Smells; especially the stink of a Candle ill put out. Violent Exercise dissolves the Bands that fasten the Child to the Womb; as Dancing, Running, Riding, Jolting in a Coach or Cart, carrying or lifting from the Ground a heavy Weight, a violent Fall, a Blow on the Belly, vehement Motion of the Belly, by Coughing, Vomiting, Looseness, Sneezing, Convulsions, Crying-out, immoderate or over-wanton Embraces, and in a word, vehement motion of the Arms, the turning a Wheel, or doing some such work, may exceedingly promote Abortion. [Page 403](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/382:5.6?vid=65404)The Signs of present Abortion are manifest of themselves; but such as go before Abortion, and prognosticate the same, are these: An unusual heaviness of the Loins and Hips, an unwillingness to stir, Appetite gone, shivering and shaking coming by Fits, pain of the Head, especially about the Roots of the Eyes, a straitening of the Sides and Belly above the Navel, the flagging or falling, and extenuation of the Dugs; but if frequent pains, and almost continual Torment, the Reins and Loins reaching towards the Share, as far as the Os sacrum, with endeavours to evacuate the Womb, certainly the Woman will shortly miscarry. If from violent external Causes, such as are a Blow, a Fall, and the like, vehement Pain and Perturbation arise in a Woman with Child; she ought to keep her Bed three days or longer. As to the Prognosticks, Women are more endangered by Abortion than by a true and timely Birth, because it is more violent and unseasonable; for as in ripe Fruit, the Stalks are loosened from the Boughs, and the Fruit falls off of it self; so in a natural Birth, the Vessels and Ligaments wherewith the Child is tyed to the Womb are loosened and untyed, as it were, of their own accord, which in Abortion must needs be vioiently broken asunder. Abortion is most dangerous in the sixth, seventh and eighth Month. Our ordinary Women say, A miscarrying Woman is half with Child again. The Cure of Abortion consists in Preservation; for that which is past, cannot be helpt: But all the Symtoms which follow Abortion, are the same which accompany Women duly brought to bed. The preservation from Abortion consists principally in these two things; the one concerns the Woman before she is with Child, and the other when she is with Child. Before the Woman is with Child, all Indispositions of the Body, which are wont to cause Abortion, must be removed; as fulness of Blood, ill Humours, and peculiar Diseases of the Womb, viz. Intemperies, Swellings, Ulcers, and the like. [Page 404](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/383:5.6?vid=65404)Fulness of Blood opens the Veins of the Womb, or strangles the Infant while it is in the Womb; this, if it be a pure and simple Plenitude, may be cured by Blood-letting, such as shall answer the quantity of Blood superabounding. A Cacochymy is either Cholerick, and partaking of Acrimony, so as to open the Orifices of the Veins, or by provoking Nature; it stirs up the expulsive Faculty, whereby the Child comes to be expelled with those ill Humours; or it suffocates the Child, by reason of plenty of Excrements heap'd together in the first Region, and distending the Belly; or it vitiates the Blood in the whole Body, rendring it unfit to nourish the Child; or it fills the Vessels of the Womb which retain the Child, with a slymy moisture. Bleeding may be also used for this Cacochymy, in a small quantity; but the chiefest way of Cure is by frequent Purging, that the superfluous Excrements of the Body may be evacuated; and betwixt Purge and Purge, such things must be used as asswage the Intemperies of the Bowels, and the Acrimony of the Humors if there be any, and thicken the said Humors, in case they be too thin, and if flegmatick Humors abound, they must be discussed with Sudorificks and Diureticks, and other Remedies; howbeit, we must diligently observe, that whatever ill Humors abound, Issues are very proper to prevent Abortion; of which Zacutus Lusitanus gives a special note in these words: By most happy Experiments I have observed, That frequent Abortion caused by corrupted Humors, which flow from the whole Body to the Womb, and by their evil disposition or abundance kill the Child, is hereby, as by a most present help, prevented; many Women have miscarried on this account, among whom some having oftentimes brought a Child of seven Months, or four Months growth, torn and putrified, cou'd by no other means be freed from so great a Calamity, save by Issues made in their Arms and Thighs, which were always made at the beginning of the Fluxion; by which means they went out their time, and brought forth Children healthy, and not defiled with any Infection. [Page 405](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/384:5.6?vid=65404)The peculiar Diseases of the Womb, as over-great Moisture, Swellings, Ulcers, and such like, must be cured by their proper Remedies. If these Diseases happen when a Woman is with Child, the difficulty is greater, because big-bellied Women cannot so easily bear all kind of Remedies; yet, lest being destitute of all help, they should remain in extream danger of Miscarriage and Death, some kind of Remedies are to be used. In case, therefore, the Patient be too full of Blood, she must have a Vein opened, tho' she be with Child, especially in the first Months, and so twice or thrice if need be, always remembring that there never be much Blood taken away at a time. And when there is abundance of some ill Humors, gentle Purging must be repeated, especially in the middle Months; and if a moist and flatulent, or slymy Intemperies annoy the Patient, we may sometimes proceed to a Sudorifick Diet, at least a gentle one, in the strongest sort of Women. In the mean while, these astringent and strengthening Medicines are to be used all the time the Woman is with Child, that are proper to hinder Abortion. Take of Kermes-berries and Tormentil-roots, each three ounces, of Mastich, one drachm and an half; make a Powder, of which give now and then half a drachm, or as much as will lie on the point of a Knife. Or, Take of red Coral, two drachms, Kermes-berries, Date-stones, each one drachm, shavings of Ivory half a drachm, of Pearls not bor'd, one scruple; make a Powder. Or, let her take every day in the morning, some grains of Mastich. Our ordinary Women use frequently Plantain-seed, which they take in the morning to the quantity of half a drachm with Wine and Water, or in an Egg, or Broath, or by it self, almost every day, all the while they are with Child, and with good success. [Page 406](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/385:5.6?vid=65404)To the same purpose, very effectual Electuaries are compounded, according to the following Example. Take of Conserve of Roses, two ounces, of Citron-peel candied, six drachms, of Myrabolans candied, of the pulp of Dates, each half an ounce, of Coral prepared, Pearl prepared, and shavings of Hartshorn, each one drachm, with syrup of Quinces; make an Electuary, of which let the Patient take often the quantity of a Nutmeg. If a Liquor be more pleasing, a Decoction of Tormentil-roots sweet'ned with Conserve of Roses, may be given successfully. The following Lozenges are very good; for they strengthen, and by little and little free the Body from Excrements, though they do not sensibly purge sometimes. Take of Mace, of the three sorts of Sanders, Rhubarb, Sena, Coral, Pearl, each one scruple, of Sugar dissolved in Rose-water, four ounces; make all into Lozenges, weighing three drachms apiece. Let her take one twice a week by it self, or dissolved in a little Broath. Ointments and Plasters are to be applied outwardly. Take of Ship-pitch, half an ounce, of Frankincense one ounce, Mastich half an ounce, Dragons blood and red Roses, each two drachms; make a Cerecloath. Or, Take of Oil of Myrtles and Mastich, each one ounce, of red and yellow Sanders, Hypocistis and Acacia, each half an ounce, of Spodium and red Roses, each two drachms, of Bole-armonick, seal'd Earth, Ivory, each two scruples, of Turpentine washed in Plantain-water, one ounce, with a sufficient quantity of Wax; make a Cereloath, spread it on Cloath, and apply it to the Reins, [Page 407](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/386:5.6?vid=65404)Or, Take of the Plaster for the Matrix three ounces, of Bistort-roots, Acacia, Hypocistis, Pomgranat-peels, each half an ounce, of Labdanum, six drachms; soften them with the juice of Quinces, and make a Plaster for the use aforesaid. As to Plasters it is to be noted, That they must not be worn long together, but taken off now and then; otherwise, if they stick too long upon the Back, they do so heat the Kidnies, that sometimes they occasion an heat of Urine, and the voiding by Urine Sand, Stones, yea Blood it self. Nor are those things to be omitted, which are accounted Specificks for retaining the Child in the Womb, as the Eagle's stone worn about the Neck, a Load-stone applied to the Navel, Corals, Jaspers, Smaragds, Bones found in the Hearts of Stags, and such like, worn under the Arm-pits or hanged about the Neck. But that the success of these Medicines may be good, the Patient must be ordered to rest, and to keep her self as quiet as possibly she can, both in Body and Mind, and to abstain from Coition, which does much disquiet the Womb; for whilst the Womb opens it self to receive the Semen, with which it is much delighted, it drops out the tender Fetus, not yet well setled in the Womb. But if notwithstanding the Medicines aforesaid, by reason of the vehemency of the Cause, whether it be external or internal, the Patient be ready to miscarry, we must do the best we can with these following Remedies. And, in the first place, so soon as Pains and Throws shall be perceived to be in the lower parts of the Belly, towards the Pubis, in the Loins, and about the Os sacrum, we must seek to allay and stop them, both by Medicines taken inwardly, and outwardly applied, according to the variety of the Causes; for if Abortion be caused by Crudities and Wind (which is most usual when it begins from an internal Cause,) a Powder must be given, made of Aromaticum Rosatum [Page 408](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/387:5.6?vid=65404) and Coriander-seeds; and we may give of the Aqua Imperialis, if Phlegm and Wind abound. At the same time let Carminative Medicines be applied below the Navel of the Patient; such are, Bags of Anniseeds, Fennel-seeds, Fenugreek-seeds, Flowers of Camomile, Elder, Rosemary and Stechas mixed together; or a Rose-cake fried in a Pan with rich Canary, and sprinkled with Powder of Nutmegs and Coriander-seeds, or the Gaul of a Wether newly kill'd, or his Lungs laid on warm, If by these means the pains cease not, let a Glister be injected made of Wine and Oil, wherein two drachms of Philonium Romanum may be dissolved, or Narcoticks may be given inwardly in a small quantity, to allay the violence of the Humors and Wind, as we are wont to do in the pains of the Cholick. But if by reason of contumacious pains that will not be asswaged, or of the violence of some external cause, Blood begins to come away, Medicines that cause Revulsion are to be applied to turn the course of the Blood from the Womb; such are, Frictions of the upper parts and painful Ligatures, also Cupping-glasses fastened to the Shoulder-blades under the Dugs, and under the short Ribs on both sides; and if the Woman be full of Blood, it will not be amiss to take some blood from her, when she begins to void blood, and especially before it begins to come; and the blood must be taken away at several times, a little at once. And if the flux of blood continues, we must proceed to an astringent and thickening Diet and Medicines, and so the Powders and Electuaries before described may be administred; also juice of Plantain new drawn, and syrup of Poppies to the quantity of an ounce, with Powder of Bole-armenick or Dragons-blood. Also binding and astringent Fomentations may outwardly, made of Pomgranate-peels, Cypress-nuts, Acorn-cups, Baclaustins, Grape-stones and the like boiled in Smiths water and red Wine. Or a little bag full of red Roses and Balaustins may be boiled, and applied hot to the Patient's Belly. [Page 409](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/388:5.6?vid=65404)The above-mentioned Plasters and Cere-cloaths may be and to bind more, make a Pultiss of astringent Powders, with Turpentine and whites of Eggs, spread it upon Tow or course Flax, and apply it to the Navel and Reins warm: The Tow that is to be applied to the Navel must be moistened with Wine, that which is to be apply'd to the Kidnies, with Vinegar. The two following Medicines are accounted Secrets, and it is believed they will certainly retain the Child in the Womb, if they be used before it be torn from the Vessels of the Womb. Take of Leaves of Gold, number twelve, of Spodium one drachm, the Cock's treading of three Eggs not addled; mix all very well, till the Gold be broken into small pieces, afterwards dissolve them in a draught of white Wine, and give it three Mornings following. At the same time let the following Cataplasm be applied. Take of Male-frankincense powdered, two ounces, the whites of five Eggs; let them be stirr'd together over hot Coals; add Turpentine to make them stick, then spread them upon Tow, and lay them upon her Navel as hot as she can possibly endure them twice a day, Morning and Evening, on the three days aforesaid. [Page 410](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/389:5.6?vid=65404) CHAP. CVII. Of hard Labour. THAT is said to be hard Labour which does not observe the due and ordinary course of Nature, and longer time is spent in it, and the pains are more violent than usual, and the Symptoms that accompany it are more grievous. Many Causes may be assigned of it, both external and internal: The internal depend on the Mother, the Womb or the Child. As to the Mother, the natural weakness of the whole Body may make the Labour difficult, or her Age, she being too young or too old, or it may be occasioned by Diseases which she had with her Big-belly, Leanness and too much dryness of the Body, or Fat compressing the Passages of the Womb; the ill conformation of the Bones encompassing the Womb as in those that are Lame, may also occasion it, Wind swelling the Bowels, a Stone, or a preternatural Tumour in the Bladder that presses the Womb, may be the cause; so may the ill constitution of the Lungs, or of the parts serving Respiration: For the holding of the Breath is very necessary to help the exclusion of the Child. As to the Womb, various Diseases of it may render the Delivery difficult, as Tumors Ulcers, Obstructions, and the like. As to the Child, hard Labour is occasion'd, when by reason it is dead or putrified, or any way diseased, it cannot confer any thing to its own exclusion: Also, when the Body or Head of it is large, or when there are many. So Twins most commonly cause hard Labour, or when it is ill situated, as when the Hands or the Feet offer first, or when one Hand or one Foot comes out, or when it is doubled, or when the Membranes break too soon, so that the Water flows out, and leaves the Orifice of the Womb dry at the time of exclusion, or [Page 411](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/390:5.6?vid=65404) when the Membranes are too thick, so that they cannot be easily broken by the Child. The external causes depend on things necessary and contingent; things necessary are those which are commonly call'd Non-natural; so cold and dry Air, and a North-wind are very injurious to Women in Labour, because they bind the Body, and drive the Blood and Spirits to the inner Parts, and they are very injurious to the Child coming from so warm a place; also, hot Weather dissipates the Spirits, and weakens the Child, and causes a Fever in an ill habit of Body. Crude Aliments and such as are difficultly concocted, and those that bind, taken in great quantity before Labour, do render it difficult, the Stomach being weakened, and the common Passages contracted, which ought to be very open in this case. Drowsiness hinders the action of the Mother and Child, and shews that Nature is weak. The unseasonable motion of the Woman much retards the delivery; as when she refuses upon occasion to stand, walk, lie or sit, or flings her self about unadvisedly, so that the Child can not be born the right way, being turned preposterously by the restlesness of the Mother. The retention of such things as should be evacuated at the time of Labour, as of Urine that swells the Bladder, or Excrements in the right Gut; the Hemorrhoids also much swelled, narrow the neck of the Womb, and so hinder Natures endeavours. And, lastly, violent Passions of the Mind, as Fear, Sorrow and Anger, make the Labour difficult. To things contingent ought to be referred, a Blow, a Fall or a Wound, which may much obstruct Labour; also, the By-standers, which ought to assist the Woman, viz. strong Women and Maids, which may lift her up just at the time of Delivery, especially a skilful Midwife, which ought to advise in every matter, for if she be unskilful she may make the Labour difficult: For sometimes the Midwife orders the Woman to endeavour an Expulsion, and to stop her Breath when the Ligaments of the Fetus stick firmly to the Womb, so that the Woman is tired before the time of her Delivery. [Page 412](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/391:5.6?vid=65404)Difficult Labour is known, both by the Woman, by the By-standers, and especially by the Midwife. And, first, if the Woman continue a long time in Labour, viz. two, three, four or more days, whereas a natural Birth is finished in 24 hours. Another Sign of difficult Labour is languid pains, returning at long Intervals; also, the pains tending backward rather than forward: But the Causes of difficult Labour may be known by the Womans Relation, and most commonly upon sight. So the weakness of the Woman, or leanness, or overfatness, may be seen by the habit of Body. The Diseases of the Womb may be known by their proper Signs, the weakness of the Child by the weak and slow motion of it: But the signs of a dead Child may be known by the following Chapter. The bigness of the Child may be judged of by the stature of the Parents, especially if a gigantick Man be married to a dwarfish Woman: But when there are none of these Causes, and the Womans and Childs endeavours are strong, and yet the Labour is difficult, it is a sign that the Secundine is so strong, that it cannot be easily broken, and this will be confirmed if no water or moisture flows out in Labour. The preposterous figure of the Fetus may be perceived by the Midwife, and other things, as has been said, by sight. As to the Prognostick, difficult Labour is of it self dangerous, and sometimes the Woman, and sometimes the Child, and sometimes both are extinguished. If a Woman continue in Labour four days, she will hardly escape. Sleepy Diseases and Convulsions coming upon hard Labour, are most commonly deadly. Sneesing coming upon hard Labour, is good. As to the Cure of hard Labour: First, all those things which retard it must, as much as may be, be removed; afterwards, Medicines that further Labour must be methodically administred. And first, it is common with Women to give a spoonful or two of Cinnamon-water, or Cinnamon powdered with a little Saffron, or half a drachm of Confection of Alkerms in broath, or half a scruple of Saffron alone in some broath, or every hour in a little VVine. [Page 413](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/392:5.6?vid=65404)Or, Take of Oil of sweet Almonds and of white Wine, each two ounces, of Saffron and Cinnamon, each twelve grains, of Confection of Alkermes, half a drachm, of syrup of Maiden-hair, one ounce and an half; mingle them, make a Potion. If these things are not sufficient, the following may be used, which I have frequently found very effectual. Take of Dittany, of Crete, and both the Birthworts, and of Troches of Myrrh, each half a scruple, of Saffron and Cinnamon, each twelve grains, of Confection of Alkermes, half a drachm, of Cinnamon-water half an ounce, of Orange-flower-water, and of Mugwort-water, each one ounce; make a Potion. Oil of Ambar, of Cinnamon, and extract of Saffron are very effectual in a small quantity, viz. five grains of extract of Saffron, four or five drops of Oil of Cinnamon, twelve or fifteen drops of Oil of Ambar, in VVine, Broath, or some other Liquor. Sneesing hastens Delivery; it may be provoked by the following Powder. Take of white Hellebore, half a drachm, of long Pepper, one scruple, of Castor, five grains, make a Powder; let the quantity of a Pease, be blown up into the Nostrils. But difficult Labour must be helpt, not only with inward Remedies proposed, but also with external; let the Midwife, therefore, frequently anoint the VVomb with the Oils of Lillies, sweet Almonds, Linseed and the like; and let the Belly be fomented with an emollient decoction of the Roots of Mallows, Violets, Mugwort, the flowers of Camomile and Melilot. Sharp Glisters are to be injected, by the irritation of which the expulsive faculty of the VVomb will be stimulated, [Page 414](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/393:5.6?vid=65404) and the Guts being emptied thereby, there will be more room for the VVomb. Anoint the Navel with Oil of Ambar; and such things as are thought to help Delivery by a specifick quality are to be used, as the Eagle's-stone, the Load-stone, Storax, Calamint and the like bound to the Hips; and if the Woman has any Gems about her, as in Rings or the like, they must be pull'd off; for many Women think, that such things retain the Child by a specifick Quality. If the Child seem to be weak, it must be refreshed, by giving strengthening things to the Mother, as hot Wine, Confection of Alkermes, Cinnamon-water, and the like. If the Child begins to come forth preposterously, as with one Arm, or first with the foot, or the like; the Midwife must thrust them back, and turn the Child right, which may be done by placing the VVoman in a Bed upon her back, with her Head low, and her feet high; and then force the Child gently into the VVomb, and then the Midwife must endeavour to turn it right, viz. to turn the Face towards the Mothers back, and the Buttocks and Legs must be elevated towards the Mothers Navel, and so she must hasten a legitimate Birth. But all hopes of Delivery being past, or the Mother being near Death, some Authors propose the Cesarian Section, whereof Franciscus Rossetus wrote an excellent Treatise, wherein he endeavours to shew, by many Arguments, that it may sometimes succeed: But because this operation is dangerous, and very terrible, it ought rarely or never to be attempted by a prudent Physician, if he values his own Reputation. [Page 415](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/394:5.6?vid=65404) CHAP. CVIII. Of a Dead Child. WHen the Child is dead the Motion of it ceases, which either the Mother felt before in the Womb, or the Midwife with her Hand; a greater sense of weight with Pain afflicts the Belly; when the Woman turns from side to side, she perceives the Child fall like a Stone from one part to another, the Belly feels cold, the natural Heat being extinguish'd, and the Spirits dissipated, which were contained in the Child; the Eyes are hollow, the Face and Lips pale, the extream parts cold and livid, the Breasts flaccid, and at length, the Child putrifying, a fetid Ichor and Sanies flows from the Womb, an ill and strong smell exhales from the Woman's Body, and her Breath stinks: If the Secundine be excluded before the Fetus, it is a certain Sign that the Child is dead. The whole Cure consists in the exclusion or extraction of the Child. Take of the Leaves of Savin dryed, of the Roots of round Birthwort, of the Troches of Myrrh, and of Castor, each one drachm; of Cinnamon half a drachm; of Saffron one scruple: Mingle them, make a Powder, whereof let her take one drachm in Savin Water. In the mean while apply to the Pubes, Privities, and Perineum an emolient Decoction. After the Fomentation anoint the Parts with the Ointment de Arthanita, and let a Pessary be put up the Privities. Take of the Roots of round Birthwort, Orris, black Helebore; of Coloquintida and Myrrh, each one drachm; of Galbanum and opopanax, each half a drachm: With Ox-Gall make a Pessary. [Page 416](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/395:5.6?vid=65404)It is also proper, if the Strength be sufficient, to give a Purge. Angelus Sala says, That he has used with very good success Mercurius Vitae in this Case, four or five grains at a time, and that it does powerfully exclude a dead Child, and is better than other Remedies: But it must be used with great Caution, because it is a violent Medicine. If after having tried Medicines a long while, the Child cannot be ejected, Chirurgical Operation must be used, that is perform'd either by Instruments or by the Hand alone, CHAP. CIX. Of the Secundine retained. IN a Natural Birth the Secundine is wont most commonly to be excluded presently after the Child, yet sometimes it is retained, whereby the Life is much endangered. The internal causes of this Retention are too great a thickness of the Coats, so that they stick firmly to the sides of the Womb, the swelling of them, by an afflux of Humors occasioned by hard Labour, and the shutting of the Mouth of the Womb after the exclusion of the Fetus. The external causes are, coldness of the Air, whereby the Secundine is expelled, and the orifice of the Womb shut; certain Perfumes, whereby the Womb is allur'd upwards; violent Passions of the Mind, as fear and sudden Frights; the perversness of the Woman, who will not abide in such a position, or use such Endeavours as are requisite; the weight of the Child, whereby the Navel is broken, the Secundine remaining within; the unskilfulness of the Midwife, who cuts the Umbilical Vessels too soon, or does not hold them in her left hand as she ought, for if they are let go they are drawn back into the Womb, and are [Page 417](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/396:5.6?vid=65404) hid there with the Secundine, whereas it ought they serve for the extraction of the Secundine. It is easie to be known when the Secundine is retained in the Womb; but sometimes a piece of it is separated and remains in the Womb, which is not so easily found; yet it may be known, for that the Womb after delivery endeavours to eject something: But tho' its endeavours are but small, a sense of Heat and Pain is perceived in the Womb, and after a few Days a cadaverous Smell exhales from the Womb. The retention of the Secundine is very dangerous, and if it continues some Days, an acute Fever, Nauseousness, Fainting, difficulty of Breathing, Coldness of the extream Parts, Epileptick and Hysterick Fits, and at length Death follow. The Secundine retained is expelled by the same Remedies which were proposed for a dead Child, to which may be added some Specificks delivered by Authors. Gesner and Augenius commend much the Testicles of a Horse cut in pieces, and dried in an Oven, as much of the Powder of them as may be contained with three Fingers, being taken in Chicken-Broath, and it may be repeated twice or thrice upon occasion. Rulandus says, He has given, with success, thirty Drops of the Oil of Juniper. Some order the Woman to bite an Onyon three or four times, and to swallow the Juice, and presently after to drink a small draught of Wine, by which she may be soon relieved. Forestus mentions a Widwife who received the following Secret from a Jewish Physician; He took the Leaves of Green Lovage, and pressed out the Juice with good Rhenish-Wine, and gave a Draught of it. Angelus Sala commends Mercurius Vitae, as before in a dead Child. To these things may be added Sneezing-Powders, Fomentations, Liniments and other things both external and internal, described above for difficult Labour. The following Decoction has been very succesful. [Page 418](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/397:5.6?vid=65404)Take of Vinegar of Roses four or five quarts, of the Leaves and Berries of Bayes, each three handfuls; one Rose-Cake cut in pieces: Boil them, and with the Decoction, hot, wash the Hips and Legs from the Groin to the Feet for a long while. To this Decoction may conveniently be added of Myrrh and both the Birth-Worts, each one ounce. But among other things the Hand of a skilful Surgeon may do much, before the Inflammation and Inflation are increased; for so the Secundine may be gently drawn out, and the Woman freed from all the Symptoms and Fatigue of Medicines. If the Secundine cannot be ejected by any means, but sticks firmly to the Womb, and putrifies there, Suppuratives must be injected, mixed with things that cleanse, that that which is putrified may be drawn out by degrees; to this purpose, Rondoletius commends Basilicon, especially being dissolv'd in the following Decoction. Take of the Leaves of Mallows, with the Roots three handfuls; of the Roots of both the Birth-worts, each six drachms; of Flax-seeds and Fenugreek-seeds, each half an ounce; of Violets one handful; of the Flowers of Camomel, and the lesser Centaury, each half an handful: Make a Decoction in Water, mingle Oil with it, if you would have it suppurate much; but if you more design to cleanse, add a little nguentum Aegyptiacum. [Page 419](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/398:5.6?vid=65404) CHAP. CX. Of a Suppression of the Child-bed Purgations. THere is so great a Flux of Humors from all parts of the Womb, when a Woman is with Child, and during the Commotion in her Labour, that in case there be not afterwards sufficient Evacuation of them, the Woman is in great danger of very ill Accidents, and sometimes of Death it self; because these Humors corrupting by their stay there, will certainly cause a great Inflammation: And this is the reason why the Suppression of the Lochia is one of the worst and most dangerous Symptoms which can befal a Woman after Delivery, especially if they happen to be totally and suddenly stopt the first three or four days, which is the time they should come down plentifully; for then follow an acute Fever, great Pains in the Head, Pains in the Breast, Reins and Loins, Suffocation of the Mother, and an Inflammation, which is suddenly communicated to the Belly, which becomes very much swell'd and blown up; there happens also a great difficulty in Breathing, Choakings, Palpitation of the Heart, Fainting, Convulsions, and often Death it self, if the Suppression continues, and if the Woman over-lives it, she is in danger of an Abscess in the Womb, and afterwards of a Cancer, or there may happen great Imposthumes in the Belly, also the Gout, Sciatica and Lameness, or an Inflammation and Abscess in the Breast. The Causes of the Stoppage of the Lochia proceed either from a great Loosness, because a great Evacuation that way turns the Lochia, and makes them stop, or any strong Passion of the Mind; so do great Colds, and cold Drink. To bring the Lochia well down, let the Woman avoid all Perturbations of Spirit, which may stop them; let her lie in Bed with her Head and Breast a little raised, keeping her self very quiet, that so the Humors may be carried downwards by their natural [Page 420](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/399:5.6?vid=65404) tendency: Let her observe a good Diet, somewhat hot and moist, and apply an Hysterick Plaster to her Navel. Take of the Conserves of Roman Wormwood and of Rue, each one ounce; of the Troches of Myrrh two drachms; of Castor, English Saffron, Volatil Salt of Sal Armoniack and of Assa Fetida, each half a drachm: with a sufficient quantity of the Syrup of the five opening Roots; make an Electuary. Let her take the quantity of a large Nutmeg every third Hour, drinking upon it three or four spoonfuls of the following Mixture. Take of the Water of Penny Royal and Balm, each three ounces; of compound Briony-Water two ounces; of Syrup of Mugwort three ounces and an half; of Saffron two drachms; of Castor tied up in a Rag and hanged in the Glass, one scruple; mingle them. If these things are used presently upon the Suppression, they generally take it off: But if they have been used so long that all the quantity is taken, and the Lochia are still stopt, in this case we may use Laudanum for once, but it is best to mix it with hysterick things: For instance, Take of liquid Laudanum sixteen drops, in a spoonful of compound Briony-water: Or, Take of solid Laudanum one grain and an half; of Assa Fetida one scruple and an half: Make two Pills. But it must be carefully noted, that if upon once taking the Business is not done, Opium by no means must be repeated again: But having waited a while to see what it will do, we must return again to Emmenagoges mix'd with Hystericks, and afterwards we must Inject a Glister: But what was said before of Opium is also to be taken notice of in respect of Glisters; for unless the [Page 421](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/400:5.6?vid=65404) first bring down the Lochia, nothing is to be hoped for from more. These things therefore being done, it is safest, and the duty of a prudent Physician to wait and see what Time will do; for every Day the Danger will lessen, and if the Sick live over the twentieth Day, she will be in a manner out of Danger; for then she will be able to bear that Method, which is fittest to conquer the Diseases which were occasioned by the Suppression of the Lochia. CHAP. CXI. Of After-Pains. PAins happen so frequently to Women in Childbed, that few are free from them; but they seldom require the Physicians help, because they usually cease in two or three Days: But if they are sharp and continue longer, they are forced to send for Physicians, who before they prescribe ought to enquire into the causes of the Pains. The chief Causes therefore of Pains after Labour are a great quantity of Blood, the Thickness and Acrimony of it, and the Narrowness of the Vessels; for when the Veins of the Womb have ceased to evacuate Blood for nine Months; and when that is heaped up in a great quantity, and also grows thick and acrimonious by it's long stay, it occasions Pain while it passes through the narrow Passages, which returns by Intervals, as often as the Womb endeavours the Evacuation of the Blood And when that is over, the Pain ceases till more Blood endeavours to come out. These Pains are also sometimes occasioned by Wind, or cold received into the Womb; but the Pain seldom happens from these Causes [Page 422](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/401:5.6?vid=65404)This Pain is distinguished from other Pains, that are wont to afflict the Belly, by the continuance or Intervals, which follow the Evacuation of Blood, and Women can easily distinguish them themselves. The thick Blood easily coagulates, but the thin is known by its thinness and fresh colour. If the Pain arises from Wind, it is more wandring, and possesses more parts of the Belly, nor does it follow the Intervals of the Evacuation of Blood: If cold Air be admitted into the Womb, it may be known by those things which have been done about the Woman. These Pains are not dangerous, but are most commonly very troublesome, and therefore are to be taken off or asswaged as soon as may be. As to the Cure, the Vessels of the Womb must be relaxed, and the thickness of the Blood attenuated, and its Acrimony qualified, all which may be done by the following means. And first the Woman's Belly must be gently swathed, that it may subside and not move hither and thither, as it often happens after Delivery, upon so sudden an evacuation, and then give of Oil of Almonds fresh drawn three ounces, mixed with an ounce and an half of Syrup of Violets. And Glisters may be injected made of Milk and Sugar, and Yolks of Eggs; or they may be prepared of a Decoction of Camomel-flowers, and of Mugwort in Chicken-broath, adding to them Oil of Lillies and Yolks of Eggs. And the Belly of the Woman must be anointed with Carminitive and Aperitive Oils, as with Oil of Dill, Rue, Jasmin, or with the following, which is very effectual, which may be prepared for this use in due season and kept in the Shops. Take of the Roots of round Birth-wort, of Orris and Peony each one ounce, of Cyprus half an ounce, of the dried Leaves of Mugwort, Feverfew, Rue, Bettony and Sage, each one handful, of the Flowers of Rosemary, Stechas, Lavender, Camomel, Dill, S. John's Wort, Elder, [Page 423](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/402:5.6?vid=65404) each half an handful, of the Grains of Lawrel and Juniper, each half an ounce, of Cummin, the Seeds of Rue, Peony, Daucas, of the Chast Tree, each three drachms, of Cloves, Nutmegs, Cinnamon and Ginger, each two drachms, of Storax and Myrrh each one ounce: Bruise them and cut them, and infuse them in three quarts of old Oil, adding a litte White-Wine; keep them in an earthen Vessel, well stopt, for the space of a Week, then boil them upon hot Ashes four or five hours, then press out the Oil, and keep it for use. If you have it not ready prepared, you may boil the Simples upon occasion with equal parts of Oil and White-Wine, to the consumption of the Wine, afterwards press out the Oil. A Fomentation may be also made of a Decoction of Mugwort, Feverfew, Baulm, of the Leaves of Bays and Calaminth, of the Seeds of Daucas, Cummin and Caraways, of the Flowers of Wall-flower and Camomel made in Water and White-Wine, or in Milk: Or the following Cataplasm may be applied. Take of Onions boil'd in Water number three or four, bruise them in a Mortar, and add to them of the Seeds of Cummin and Flax bruised, each one handful: With a sufficient quantity of the Flowers of Camomel and Barly-meal, make a Cataplasm; and if there be occasion, add a little of the Water wherein the Onions were boil'd: Spread it upon a cloath, and apply it hot to the Navel. It is also proper to cover the Belly with a Sheep's-skin fresh flea'd off, and applied hot, for the Heat of it is very agreeable, it eases the Pain, and keeps the Belly from wrinkling. And the following things may be taken inwardly. Take of the Seeds of Daucas powdered one drachm, of White-Wine three ounces: Mingle them and give it twice in a day. Or, [Page 424](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/403:5.6?vid=65404)Take of Nutmegs, Aniseeds and Cinamon, each one scruple: Mingle them, make a Powder, give it with White-wine, or one scruple of Oil of Nutmegs with Broath. Forestus used the Flowers of Camomel in Beer, or a Decoction of Camomel and Mugwort in Chicken-Broath with good Success. It is good presently after Delivery to give the Broath of an old Cock early in the Morning fasting, for three Days, with a little Cinnamon and Saffron. The following Powder taken presently after Delivery, preserves the Woman from Pain, in a wonderful manner; and some think if a Woman takes it the first Lying in, she will never be troubled in Child-bed with these kind of Pains. Take of Comfry dried one drachm, of the Kernels of Peach-Stones, and of Nutmegs, each two scruples, of Ambar half a drachm, of Ambergrise half a scruple: Make a Powder, whereof let her take a drachm with White-Wine, and if there be a Fever with Broath. Let her use for her ordinary Drink a Decoction of Mugwort and Cinnamon. When the Pains arise from Cholerick and Acrid Humors, they must be cured in a manner the same way as the Cholick, occasioned by Choler. For instance, Take of Syrup of Violets and of Borrage, each one ounce, of the Mucilage of the Seeds of Quinces, extracted with Violet-Water half an ounce, of Borrage, and Scorzonera-Water, each three ounces; mingle them, make a Julep for two Doses: Or, [Page 425](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/404:5.6?vid=65404)Take of Oil of Sweet Almonds two ounces, of Syrup of Violets one ounce, of Borrage Water half an ounce: Mingle them for one draught. External Medicines that loosen and mollifie the Passages must be applied. Child-bed Women after Delivery are often troubled with a Pain in the Groin; it may be taken off by applying a Plaster of Galbanum and Assafetida to the Navel, in the middle whereof some grains of Musk must be placed. CHAP. CXII. Of the Acute Diseases of Women in Child-bed. THE Fever from Milk, whilst the Child-bed Purgations proceed right, seldom lasts beyond three Days, for about that Time it usually goes off, by a great Sweat coming of its own accord: But this Intemperies occasioned by the coming of the Milk is somewhat heightned, and continues longer, when the Milk flows plentifully to the Breasts, and is not milkt out, but repelled: For by its going back as well as its coming, there is a Disturbance in the whole Body usually, which comes more certainly, if the Milk be driven violently back by Repelling Topicks. Some common Rules are to be observed concerning the Coming of the Milk, or in driving of it back. If the Milk flow too freely into the Breasts, that the Inflammation of them, and the immoderate Effervescence of the Blood may be prevented, a thin and spare Diet must be ordered, viz. of Broath without Flesh, and the Breasts must be often sucked, and if it be not thought convenient that the Woman should give Suck, [Page 426](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/405:5.6?vid=65404) it is customary on the First or Third day of Lying-in, to apply over the Breasts moderately Astringent Cere-cloaths: But this kind of Remedy must be used with Caution, lest the Milk should be Excluded altogether, or too hastily, and so cause a disorder in the Blood, and a putrid or malignant Fever, of which we shall speak next. Women with Child, by reason their Bodies are ill affected, are as it were infected with a Pestilential Contagion, and so are very subject to a putrid, or rather malignant Fever. This Fever seizes Child-bed Women at various Seasons, and upon several Occasions; sometimes presently after Delivery, especially if it has been difficult and hard; sometimes on the first, sometimes on the second, third, or fourth Week; but the later it begins, the better it goes off. It begins and proceeds, most commonly, in the following manner: After a previous Indisposition the Fever begins most commonly, with a Shaking and Shivering, which Heat presently follows, and after that Sweat; the first or second day fits of Heat and Cold succeed one another, and then all the Blood being inflamed, the Lochia, if they were not suppressed before, flow but little, or quite stop. If the Disease be acute and of quick motion, it comes to its height the third or fourth day; the Heat is violent, and the Thirst very much, the Pulse vehement and quick, Watchings obstinate, there is great Restlessness, so that the Sick tumble from one side of the Bed to the other continually, the Urin is thick and red, and there are many other grievous Symptoms; when this Fever is in its State, no Crisis is to be expected; for I never saw this Disease go off by a critical Sweat; for when the Blood has a while Boyled, the adust Matter being presently translated to the Brain, dangerous disorders of the Genus Nervosum are occasioned, and convulsive motions of the Tendons, and inflations of the Bowels, like Mother Fits, and sometimes a Phrensie, or Delirium, and often a Stupo and loss of Speech follow, and the Strength is suddenly dejected, almost in all, without any manifest Cause; the Pulse is weak and unequal, and the Sick soon die: And if any chance to escape, the flux of the Courses being restored, or a Loosness happening, they recover difficultly after a long Sickness. [Page 427](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/406:5.6?vid=65404)The acute Diseases of Women in Childbed, are not always according to the manner of the fore-mentioned Fever, but sometimes they are accompanied with some great Symptom, as with a Quinsie, Pleurisie, Peripneumonia, Bloody-flux, Small-pox, and the like. Of these a Quinsie, Pleurisie, and Peripneumunia, by reason of the great similitude of the Cause and analogy of the Cure, may be considered together. Presently at their first beginning, we must endeavour, that the Blood fixed any where, and beginning to be Extravasated, be restored to Circulation, lest an Imposthume should be occasioned; wherefore internal Remedies, which free the Blood from Coagulation, must be used, of which sort are Diaphoreticks abounding with Volatile Salt, as Spirit of Harts-horne and Soot, Urin, also Testaceous, and Bezoartick Powders, Lapis Prunella, Decoctions and Juleps, made of Vegetables that force Urine and the Courses; with all which must be mixed such things as have been found by Experience to have been proper for Uterine Diseases. Moreover Discutient Medicines, which disperse the Matter Impacted, such are Liniments, Fomentations and Cataplasms, must be carefully applied to the Parts affected: In the mean while the violent Motion and immoderate Effervescence of the Blood must be driven far from thence, and the Filth must be driven, as much as possible, downwards. To this end Frictions, Ligatures, Epispasticks, and if there be occasion, Cupping-glasses must be applied about the Legs and Feet; if the Disease be very violent, Bleeding is indicated, and unless there be a Plethora in the whole Body, and the Inflammation be very acute in the Part affected, it will be best to open a Vein in the Foot, or to apply Leeches to the Hemorrhoidal Veins: But if necessity urge we may Bleed in the Arm, and afterwards, if it can be admitted, in the Foot. But you must take notice, that Bleeding must be cautiously used in these Cases; for unless it does good, which I have seldom found, the Sick is in worse condition, the Pulse being thereby rendred weaker. A Dissentery is very often deadly, and so much the rather because such things as qualifie the Blood, and that moderately bind are Indicated; but the flux of the Lochia forbid the use of them. Wherefore in this case [Page 428](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/407:5.6?vid=65404) till she has been well Purged by a long flux of the Lochia, the fierceness of the Symptoms must at present be only appeased. The Indications of the Small-pox are not only contrary to those above-described, but also to one another; for the flux of the Lochia must be moderately restrained; but in the mean while the Efflorescence of the Blood and gentle Sweating must be continued: For seeing a twofold venomous Ferment is in this Disease, and the corrupt Particles of the Blood are to be carried out two ways, we must take care that the least and narrowest Passage do not draw all the Matter, or more than it can let out. Wherefore, lest the Lochia flowing plentifully should turn inward the Venom that is inclined to go off by Sweat, the course of Diet must be somewhat changed, and first such things as are of an Alexipharmick and astringent nature must be boyled with their Broaths, as the Roots of Tormentil and Bistort, also Powders, Juleps and Electuaries endued with such Vertues must be given at due Intervals; and in this case the Woman must be no ways allowed Flesh, or the Broath of it, not must she Rise, but she must be kept as quiet as is possible, and the whole Business must be left in a manner to God and Nature. All Women in Child-bed have an inbred Venom, and they ought to be careful of it, and to avoid it as much as the greatest Malignity. Wherefore they ought to use an exact course of Diet, whereby the Impurities of the Blood and Humours may be purged in Child-bed without the danger of a Fever; and that the disorders of the Womb may be heal'd, and their strength, weakned by Delivery, may be restored: To which end three things are to be minded; First, An exact course of Diet must be ordered, viz. That they be fed for a Week at least with Water-Gruel, sometimes made with Beer, sometimes made with Water mix'd with Whitewine, or with Panada, and other things of easie Digestion. Secondly, They must take great care that they do not catch Cold, whereby the Pores and the Lochia may be stopt; wherefore let them continue in Bed, at least till the Tenth day. Thirdly, The Lochia must be gently provoked; to this end Midwives, when after hard Labour, there is [Page 429](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/408:5.6?vid=65404) danger of a stoppage of the Lochia; give Sperma Caeti, Irish Slates Powdered, or White Wine tinctured with Saffron, and they make the Gruel with Water and White Wine, wherein, as also in Posset Drink, they Boyl Marygold Flowers, the Leaves of Penny-royal or Mugwort. CHAP. CXIII. Of Childrens Diseases. Of ordering them; and of the Choice of a Nurse. A Child, which during the stay in its Mother's Belly, had no other Nourishment, but the Blood it received by the umbilical Vessels, hath for want of that after its Birth, need to take some by the Mouth, and Suck Breast-Milk; however, it is not good to give it Suck, as soon as it is Born, to prevent that so sudden a Change, as well in respect of the difference of Nourishment, as the manner of receiving it, lest it cause some alteration in its Health. First therefore empty the Phlegm out of its Stomach, by giving it the first three or four days some Wine and Sugar to cut and loosen it, to prevent the Milk he shall take from Corrupting, it being mixed with this viscous Phlegm; wherefore it is best to stay until the next day before you give it Suck. It were to be wished that the Mother shou'd not give it Suck until the Eighth day of her Child-bed at soonest, and it is best if she stay three Weeks or a Month, for in that time she will be well Purged by the Lochia, and the Blood will be much more pure; besides the small holes of the Nipples are not at first sufficiently opened, and therefore it is necessary for a Woman to Suck first. But often poor People cannot observe so many Precautions, and such Mothers are obliged to give their Children Suck from the first day; and likewise others will not suffer any but themselves to do it. In this case let her Breasts be a little drawn by some old Woman, [Page 430](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/409:5.6?vid=65404) or some lusty sucking Child, or they may Draw them themselves. If the Nurse has much Milk, she must not give the Child any thing else, at least the first two Months. As to the quantity of Milk the Child ought to suck, it must be proportionable to his Age and Strength; in the beginning he must not suck too much, nor too often, afterwards by little and little let it be daily augmented, until he may take his fill; but he may suck at any time night or day. After the Child has suck'd two or three Months, more or less, according as one finds he needs stronger Nourishment, give him then Pap made of Flower and Milk, though but little at first, and not too thick, lest his Stomach may be overcharged. When the Child has taken Pap thus made, which must be but once a day, especially in the Morning, or twice at most, the Nurse may give it a little suck, to the end that being washed down into the Stomach, the Digestion may be the better and easier made. There are many Women who give their Children Pap as soon as they are Born, and Nurses who have little Milk, ordinarily do so to hinder their Crying, as they will do when they are Hungry: But sometimes this of it self is enough to kill them, because of the Indigestion and Obstruction it occasions, which by reason of its gross and viscous consistence can scarce find Passage through the Stomach and Guts, which at the beginning are weak and not sufficiently opened and dilated, whereby there happens to Children great Oppressions, difficulty of Breathing, Gripes, Swellings, Pains of the Belly, and often Death. Wherefore do not give it the Child, till after the first or second Month at soonest, and if you forbore it three or four Months he would thrive the better, provided the Nurse does not want Milk. When he is in the Cradle, let it be so turned as it may be towards the Fire, the Candle, or the Chamber Window, that having the Light directly in its Face, he may not be allured to look continually on one side; for doing so often, his Sight will be so perverted, that he will grow Squint-ey'd. Wherefore for the better secucurity, [Page 431](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/410:5.6?vid=65404) throw some Covering over the head of the Cradle. Many Children are so Grip'd that they can't forbear Crying night nor day, and some die so, and this is very often the first and most common Disease that happens to little Infants after their Birth. To remedy all these Pains which Women generally call Gripes, respect must be had to their different Causes: As to that which is the general cause, viz. The too sudden change of the Nourishment, you must forbear giving the Child Suck till the next day, lest the Milk being mix'd with the Phlegm which is in the Stomach corrupt; and at first it must Suck but little until it be accustom'd to digest it, if it be the Maeconion of the Intestines, which by its long stay causes these Pains, for to help to discharge them of it, give them inwardly a little Oyl of sweet Almonds and Syrup of Roses; and to provoke it further, give it beets-Stalk cover'd with Hony for a Suppository, or a Sugar'd Almond also dip'd in common Honey, or you may give a small Glister. And when the Child is Grip'd, give no Pap, because this Food by its Viscosity, easily causes Obstructions, which afterwards ingender Wind. If the Pain be occasioned by Worms, lay a Cloath dipp'd in Oyl of Worm-wood mix'd with Ox Gall upon the Belly, or a small Cataplasm mix'd with Powders of Rue, Wormwood, Coloquintida, Aloes, and the Seeds of Citrons incorporated with Ox-gall and Flower of Lupines; and to drive them downwards if the little Infant can take any thing by the Mouth, give it a small infusion of Rubarb, or half an Ounce of Compound Syrup of Succory, having before given a small Glister of Sugar'd Milk. When the Gripes are caused by Wind, as it often happens, or by sharp Humours in the Guts, anoint the Child's Belly all over with Oyl of Violets, or else with Oil of sweet Almonds, or else with the Oyls of Wallnuts, Camomel and Melilot, mixed together, having first warm'd them, in which also a Cloath may be dipp'd to lay upon it, and a little Anodyne, or Carminative Glister may be given. Very frequently the Milk of a Nurse that is red Hair'd, given to Wine, or very Amorous, may by its heat and acrimony, cause small Ulcers in an Infant's [Page 432](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/411:5.6?vid=65404) Mouth, which are called Apthae, or the Thrush; and Vulgarly Cancers: Sometimes also though the Milk have no ill Quality in it self, it may however corrupt in the Stomach, because of its Weakness, or for some other Indisposition. Of these Ulcers some are benign, as they are caused by a simple heat of the Nurses Milk, or by the Child's Blood and Humours being a little Over-heated, or also from having had a small Fit of a Fever, and they are then very superficial, of a small continuance, and easily yielding to Remedies: Others are Malignant, such as are caused by a Venereal Venom, or that happen after a Malignant Fever, and are Scorbutick; these are putrid, corrosive and spreading, and do not only possess the Superficies of the Membranes, which cover the Roof of the Mouth and Tongue, but make deep Scabs, and are communicated to the internal Parts of the Throat, the Venereal ones especially, which can never be Cured by ordinary Remedies, but must be handled with Specificks, without which they ever augment, and soon kill little Infants, who are too weak to undergo the Remedies fit for their Cure. To Cure these Ulcers, when they are small and without malignity, you must take care to temper the Nurse's Milk, prescribing her a Cooling Diet; Bleeding and Purging also if there be occasion, and wash the Child's Mouth with Barly or Plantain Water, and Hony of Roses, or Syrup of dryed Roses, mixing with them a little Verjuice, or Juice of Limons, as well to loosen and cleanse the viscous Humours, which cleave to the inside of the Child's Mouth, as to cool those Parts, which are already over-heated. This may be done by means of a small fine Rag, fastned to the end of a little Stick, and dipp'd in the Remedy, wherewith the Ulcers may be gently rubb'd, being careful not to put them to too much Pain, lest by irritating them an Inflammation should be caused. The Child's Body must be kept open, that the Humours being carried to the lower Parts, so many Vapours may not ascend, as usually do, when the Excrements of the Belly are too long retained. [Page 433](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/412:5.6?vid=65404)If the Ulcers participate of any malignity, let topical Remedies then be used, which do the Business speedily, and as it were in an instant. For this purpose, touch the Ulcers with Plantain-water, sharpned with Spirit of Vitriol, taking great care that the Infant swallows none of it; and the Remedy must be so much the stronger and sharper, as the Ulcers are profound and malignant. As soon as they have been cauterized with this Water, by only touching them once or twice with it according to their bigness, depth or corruption, that no sharp Serosities may destil upon the parts not yet ulcerated, and upon the Infants Throat, wash its Mouth with Plantain-water, or with a decoction of Barly, Agrimony and Hony of Roses, continuing to touch and wash the Ulcers, as it may be judged convenient, and until you find they spread no further. To prevent that in the use of these sharp Medicines, not the least portion of them should fall upon the Child's Throat, and that by swallowing of them, you may receive no great prejudice. Some chuse rather to cauterize these Ulcers with small Linnen Tents dipt in boiling Oil, and if it should be swallowed, it would be no great hurt. It will not be amiss to punge the ill Humors out of the whole habit of the Child, by giving him half an ounce of syrup of Succory with Rhubarb. The Teeth, which were hidden in the Jaws, usually begin to come forth, not all at a time, but one after another, towards the fifth or sixth Month, sometimes sooner and sometimes also later; for to effect which, they cut the Gums wherewith they were covered. Then because of the exquisite sense of those parts, there happens so great pains to the Children, that many who were hitherto very well, are now in great danger of their Lives, and often die by reason of many mischievous Accidents, which happen to them at that time. And Hippocrates says, When Children begin to breed their Teeth, they are troubled with itching of their Gums, Fevers, Convulsions and Loosnesses, and principally when they breed their Tusks or Dog-teeth, especially those Children who are fat, and full of Humors, and bound. [Page 434](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/413:5.6?vid=65404)The Dog-teeth, commonly called the Eye-teeth, cause more pain to the Child than any of the rest, because they have a deep Root and a small Nerve, that has communication with that which moves the Eye. The Teeth, which are first bred, are the Cutting or Foreteeth. The Signs when Children will breed their Teeth, are, when the Gums and Cheeks are swelled, they feel a great heat there with an itching, which often makes them put their Fingers in their Mouths to rub them, from whence much Moisture destils into the Mouth, because of the Pain they feel there. The Nurse in giving them suck, finds their Mouths hotter; they are much changed, and cry every moment, and cannot sleep, or but very little at a time. And one may feel and see small points of the Teeth through the Gums, which appear thin and pale on the top, and swelled and red on the sides; and if it happen that the Teeth are a long time 'ere they are cut, or that too many of them cut at a time, there is great danger that the Child will fall into those Accidents mentioned above. In this case two things are to be regarded; first, to preserve the Child from the ill Accidents that may happen to it, by reason of the great pain: Secondly, to assist as much as may be the cutting of the Teeth, when they can hardly cut the Gums themselves. To prevent these Accidents, the Nurse must keep a good Diet, and use all things that may cool and temper the Milk, that a Fever may not follow the pain of the Teeth, and to hinder the falling of the Humors upon the inflamed Gums, keep the Child's belly always loose, to which purpose give him a gentle Glister, if the Belly be bound; but there is commonly no need of it: For at this time the Children are usually troubled with a Looseness. As to the second, which helps the cutting of the Teeth, that the Nurse must do from time to time, by gently rubbing the Childs Gums with her Finger; to which end the Child it felf may be useful, if they give a little Stick of Liquorish to them, or a small piece of a new Wax-candle, which is very good to soften the Gums. Coral is also often used to this purpose, and the Teeth of a Wolf. But these things that are peculiarly proper, [Page 435](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/414:5.6?vid=65404) what they do is by their Solidity and Roughness: But if these things do no good, the Gums must be cut with a Lancet to prevent ill Accidents. As soon as little Infants are in the least indisposed, they very commonly fall into a Looseness, to which their natural moisture very much contributes. For the most part the Looseness happens to them, by reason of the great Pain they have at the cutting their Teeth: It may also happen by the vitiousness of the Nurses Milk. But if the Looseness be not accompanied with a Fever, or some other Accident, it is not dangerous; but if it continue so long, it will not be amiss to remedy it. For this purpose, let the Child suck good Milk, and give it a slight Infusion of Rhubarb, or a little compound Syrup of Succory; gentle Anodyn Glisters may be also given, made of Milk, yolks of Eggs, and Hony of Violets; and after Purging, let them be made with Plantain-water, and mix the yolk of an Egg with the Pap. Anoint the Belly with Oil of Quinces, and lay on the Stomach a Compress dipt in red Wine, wherein Province Roses have been boiled. Vomiting usually happens to Children, because they often draw more Milk than their little Stomachs can easily contain or digest: A Cough does sometimes occasion it, so does the swathing of the Belly too hard. When the Vomiting is too frequent, it is fit it should be stopped; to which end, regard must be had to that which causes it, as when the Child sucks more than it should, the Nurse must not give it so much, but it must suck but little at a time, that the Stomach may the easier contain and digest what it receives. If it be occasioned by an ill quality of the Milk, the Nurse must be changed for a better; if from a Cough, it must be helped by things fit to appease it. The Nurse must not dance it rudely, nor rock it fiercely after it has sucked. Care must be likewise taken, that it be not too close wrapt, and swathed about the Stomach. And it will be very convenient to purge the Infant with a gentle Infusion of Rhubarb, or with half an ounce of compound syrup of Succory: And after it has been well [Page 436](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/415:5.6?vid=65404) purged, it may take a little syrup of Quinces to fortify the Stomach, and a Compress dipt in red Wine, wherein Province-roses, Cinnamon and Cloves have been boiled, may be applied to the region of the Stomach. Children are sometimes afflicted with Scabs in the Head and Face, but the course of these Humors must by no means be hindred by driving them inwards; because their Evacuation defends little Infants from many ill Diseases; and we ordinarily see them, whose Bodies have a long time purged away such Superfluities, to be better in health, after they have cast forth all this kind of Corruption. But Endeavours must be only used to hinder the generation of more of these ill Humors in the Child; wherefore, a healthy Nurse must be provided, whose Milk is pure and cool, the Child's Belly must be kept open, and purged upon occasion with a little syrup of Roses or of Succory, that so the Humors may not be sent in too great abundance to the Head, and that the Sanies under the Scabs may not eat and corrode the Skin, and so cause deep Ulcers; it will not be amiss also to make the Scabs fall off, that there may be a freer vent or issue; for which end, fresh Butter is ordinarly made use of to moisten them, or Oil of sweet Almonds; afterwards, apply a Cabbage-leaf, and change it twice or thrice a day. As to the choice of a Nurse, the first and principal of all the Qualities in a good Nurse, is, That she be the own Mother of the Child, as well because of the mutual agreement of their Tempers, as that having much more love for it, she will be much more careful than an hired Nurse, who ordinarily loves her Nurse-child but with a feigned and seeming Love, having no other end or foundation, but the hope of the Recompence she expects for her Hire. Wherefore the true Mother, though not the best Nurse, should ever be preferred before a Stranger. But because there are several that either will not, or cannot suckle their own Children, there is a necessity to provide an other Nurse, which should be chosen as convenient for the Child, as may be. [Page 437](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/416:5.6?vid=65404)Now as we see Trees produce Fruits of a different Taste, by reason of the difference of the nourishment, so the Health of Children, and sometimes their Manners depend on the nourishment they receive at the beginning. For as to the health of the Body, it is well known, it answers the Humors that all the Parts are nourished and maintained with, which Humors ever retain the nature of the Food whereof they are engendred: As for the Manners, they ordinarily follow the Temperament, which also proceeds from the quality of the Humors, and the Humors from the Food. By this consequence, as the Nurse is, so will the Child be, by means of the nourishment it draweth from her; and in sucking her, it will draw in both the Vices of her Body and Mind. This appears very easily in Animals that suck a strange Dam, for they always partake something of the Creature they suck; being accordingly, either of a mild or fiercer Nature, or of a stronger or weaker Body, which may be noted in the Example of young Lions, tamed by sucking a domestick Animal, as a Cow, a Goat or Ass; and, on the contrary, a Dog will become more furious or fierce if it sucks a Wolf. The necessary Conditions of a good Nurse are usually taken from her Age, the time and manner of her Labour, the good constitution of all the parts of her Body, and particularly of her Breasts, from the good Nature of her Milk; and, in fine, from her good Manners. As to her Age, the most convenient is from twenty five to thirty five years of Age, because that during this space the Woman is most strong, healthy and vigorous: She is not fit before five and twenty, because her Body not having yet acquired all its dimensions, cannot be so robust; nor after thirty five, because not having Blood enough in so great abundance, she cannot have Milk enough for the nourishment of the Child. However, some Women are indifferent good Nurses from twenty to forty, but very rarely before or after. As to the time and manner of her Labour, it must be at least a Month or six Weeks after it, that so her Milk [Page 438](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/417:5.6?vid=65404) may be throughly purified; because, at that time, her Body is usually cleansed of the Lochia, which follows Labour, and the Humors are no longer disturbed with it; nor must it be above five or six Months, that so she may be able to make an end of Nursing the Child, that there may be no necessity to change her afterwards for another. She must not have miscarried, but have been brought to Bed at her full time of a healthful Son, for it is a mark of a good Constitution; and it must be her second or third Child, that she may by experience know the better how to tend her Nursery. As to the healthful Constitution of her Body, 'tis the principal thing, and on which almost all the rest depends. In general, she must be very healthful and of a good habit, not subject to any Distemper; that she be come of Parents that never had the Stone in the Reins and Bladder, nor subject to the Gout, King's-evil, Falling-sickness, or any other hereditary Disease; that she hath no spot, nor the least suspicion of any venereal Distemper; that she have no Scab, Itch, Scald, or any other filth of the like nature; that she be strong, the better to watch and tend the Child in all things necessary for it; that she be of a middle Stature, neither too tall nor too low, too fat nor too lean, because a Person of such a natural Symmetry performs all the Functions more perfectly, and as is usually said, In medio consistit Virtus. But above all, she must not be with Child: Let her be of a sanguine Complexion, which may be known by her Vermilion Colour, not altogether so red, but inclining to white; of a firm Flesh, not soft; she must not likewise have her Courses, for that is a Sign that her Blood is too hot, either because her Temperament is such, or from an amorous Passion, or otherways; neither must she be subject to the Whites, for such Superfluities are a Sign of a bad habit; she must not be red haired, nor marked with red Spots, but her Hair must be black, or of a Chesnut brown: She must be well shaped, neat in her Cloaths, and comly in her Face, having a sprightly Eye, and a smiling Countenance: She must have good Eyes, sound and white [Page 439](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/418:5.6?vid=65404) Teeth, not having any rotten or spoiled, lest her breath should smell; she ought to have a sweet Voice to please and rejoice the Child, and likewise ought to have a clear and free Pronunciation, that he may not learn an ill Accent of her, as usually red-haired have, and sometimes also that are very black-haired and white Skins; for their Milk is hot, sharp and stinking, and also of an ill Taste: She must not have a strong Breath, as they who have a stinking Nose and bad Teeth, as we have said before, because the Nurse that constantly kisses the Child, would infect its Lungs by often drawing in her corrupted Breath: Her Breasts ought to be pretty big, to receive and concoct there a sufficient quantity of Milk, but not big to excess; they must be sound and free from Scars proceeding from former Impostumes; they must be indifferent firm and fleshy, and not flaggy and hanging: The Nurse must be broad-breasted; as to the Nipples they must be well shaped, they must not be too big nor too hard, nor grisly, nor sunk in too deep, but they must be a little raised and of a moderate bigness and firmness, and with many little holes, that the Child may not take too much Pains to draw the Milk. The quantity of the Milk must be sufficient for the Child's nourishment, it must be of a middle consistence, neither too waterish nor too thick, which may be easily judged, if the Nurse milking some into her Hand, and turning it a little on one side, it immediately runs off; but if it remains fixed, without running by turning of the Hand, it is a Mark it is too thick and viscous. As to the colour, the whitest is best; it must taste and smell sweet and pleasant. The Nurse must not be subject to Choler nor be quarelsome; she must not be melancholy, but merry and chearful, smiling often to divert the Child: She must be sober, not given to Wine, and yet le to the excess of Venery; but she may moderately use the first, and not totally abstain from the second, if her Nature requires it. [Page 440](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/419:5.6?vid=65404)If a Nurse has all, or most part of these Conditions here specified, as well respecting her Person as Manners, and that she maintains this condition by a Diet fit for the Childs Temperament, and not contrary to her own, there is then great reason to believe she is fit to make a very good Nurse, and to bring up, in perfect Health, the Son of a Prince. CHAP. CXIV. Of the Rickets. THIS Disease began about fifty years ago in the West of England: It is a Disease of Children, and it seizes them when they are about half a year old. The Diagnostick of this Disease, as of all others, depends upon the knowledge of the Symptoms, which follow. The proportion of the parts is irregular, viz. the Head is bigger than ordinary, so is the Face, the Wit is sharper than is usual at such an Age, the external Members, especially the Muscular, are thin and wasted, the Skin is loose and flaccid, the Bones most commonly bowed, and about, the Joins sticking out and knotty, the Spine is variously bent, the Breast is narrow and sharp, the extremity of the Ribs knotty, the Belly somewhat swelled and stiff. These things are observed outwardly. As to the inner Parts, the Liver is larger than usual, so are all the Parenchyma, the Stomach and Bowels are larger than in those that are well, the Mesentery is affected with Glandules that are larger than ordinary, if they are not Scrophulous; these things are observed in the Belly. In the Breast the Lungs are stuffed and swelled, they are sometimes purulent and scrophulous, and often stick to the Pleura, the jugular Veins and the carotid Arteries [Page 441](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/420:5.6?vid=65404) are sometimes larger than they shou'd be, but the Brain is only peccant in bigness. To these are added a weakness of almost all the parts and unwillingness to move, for such Children will play only sitting and do not care to stand, and at length in progress of the Disease, the Head can scarce be sustain'd by the weak neck. As to the Prognostick of this Disease, most commonly 'tis not deadly; but sometimes the Symptoms growing to a heighth, it degenerates into a Consumption, Hectic Fever, Dropsie of the Lungs or an Ascitis, and so at last is deadly; but the Prognostick may be easier instituted by the following Rules. First, if this Disease invades before the Birth, or presently after, 'tis very dangerous, and most commonly deadly. Secondly, the sooner it comes the worse 'tis. Thirdly, the more violent the Symptoms are, viz. if the Parts are very much disproportion'd and much wasted, the Cure is the more difficult. Fourthly, if this Disease is accompanied with the foresaid Diseases, it can scarce ever be cur'd. Fifthly, those that are not cured before they are five years of Age, are ever after sickly. Sixthly, an Itch coming upon this Disease, much conduces to the Cure. Seventhly, in those the Symptoms are not increased, but rather lessened, the Cure need not be doubted. As to the Cure, we must begin with Purging, because most commonly there is abundance of slegmatick Humors heapt up in the Belly, and the Bowels are frequently affected with scrophulous Tumors; but Purging is to be instituted by Glisters, Vomits and lenitive Catharticks. The use and forms of some Glisters. If the Belly be bound, or the Bowels are troubl'd with Wind or Gripes, Glisters must be us'd frequently, which must not be only solutive, but sometimes alterative and corroborative. For instance: Take of the leaves of Mallows, one handful, of the flowers of Melilot, Camomile and Elder, each one pugil, [Page 442](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/421:5.6?vid=65404) of the seeds of Annise and Fennel bruis'd, each half a drachm; boil them in a sufficient quantity of new Goat's Milk, to four, five or six ounces of the strain'd Liquor; add of red Sugar and of syrup of Violets and Roses, each one ounce: Make a Glister, inject it warm a good while after Eating. Take of the roots of Marshmallows bruis'd, half an ounce, of the leaves of Mallows and Pellitory, each half an handful, of the flowers of Camomil and Elder, each one pugil, of the Carminative seeds, two drachms; boil them in a sufficient quantity of Posset-drink to 5 or 6 ounces of the strained Liquor; add of Lenitive Electuary, or of Diacassia half an ounce, of fresh Butter six drachms; mingle them, to be injected warm. Corroborative Glisters may be made in the following manner. Take of fresh Stone-Horse dung, one ounce and an half, of the flowers of Rosemary and Sage, each one pugil, of Juniper-berries, two drachms, of the seeds of Annise, Fennel, each half a drachm; infuse them close and warm in a sufficient quantity of Whey, in four ounces of the strained Liquor, dissolve one ounce of brown Sugar and six drachms of fresh Butter; mingle them, make a Glister: There may also be added, if it seem convenient, six drachms of Manna. Take of Millepides washed number 20 or 30, bruise them, and pour upon them 4 or 5 ounces of Posset-drink made of white Wine, in the strained Liquor dissolve an ounce of brown Sugar, and a drachm of Venice-Turpentine dissolved in the yolk of an Egg; mingle them, make a Glister to be injected warm. The use of Vomits and Forms of them. If the Stomach be burthened with vitious Humors, and they tend upwards, Vomits must be given; but in the prescription of them, respect must be had to the tender Age, and they should consist rather of Salt of [Page 443](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/422:5.6?vid=65404) Vitriol and the Wine of Squills, than of stibiat Medicines; for it is not so safe to give these to Infants for fear of Convulsions, though sometimes they may be of use. Take of Wine or Oxymel of Squills, half an ounce or an ounce, which being taken, give half an hour after a great quantity of Posset-drink, and provoke Vomiting with the Finger, and let it be repeated now and then. Or, Take of Oxymel of Squills, half an ounce or an ounce, if it does not vomit in half an hour, give of Salt of Vitriol half a scruple or fifteen grains, in a draught of Posset-drink. If the Strength will bear stronger Vomits, let them be used. As, Take of the Infusion of Crocus Metallorum well clarified by standing, one or two drachms, according to the Age and Strength, of Oxymel of Squills three drachms or half an ounce, of simple Walnut-water, or of the water of the lesser Centaury, six drachms; mingle them, make a Vomit. Forms of Catharticks. Some days after Vomiting, or if Vomiting be not to be used, gentle Purging must be instituted, and repeated by Intervals. As, Take of the Augustan syrup, or of syrup of Succory with Rhubarb, six drachms or an ounce, of Cream of Tartar ten or fifteen Grains, mingle them, let them be taken early in a morning, either by themselves or in a draught of Posset-drink. Or, Take of Calabrian Manna, half an ounce or an ounce, of Tartar vitriolated five or ten grains, mingle them, let them be taken in a morning in broath or in Posset-drink. [Page 444](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/423:5.6?vid=65404)Take of the roots of Polypody of the Oak, and of sharp pointed Dock each six drachms, of the bark of the roots of Elder, and of Dwarf-elder, each half an ounce, of the roots of flowering Fern, male Fern and Succory, each half an ounce, of the herbs Agrimony, Liverwort, Speedwel, Hartstongue and Spleenwort, each half a handful; boil them in three pints of Fountain-water to the consumption of a third part, strain the Liquor into a matrass, and put to it two ounces of Senna, one ounce of Rhubarb, of Dodder, of Thyme and yellow Sanders, each two drachms, of the seeds of Annise and Fennel, each one drachm, of salt of Wormwood, one drachm and an half; infuse them hot in a close Vessel 12 hours: To the Liquor, cleared by standing, add an equal weight of Sugar, and by gentle boiling make a syrup. The dose is one, two or three spoonfuls, either by themselves, or in some proper Liquor. Or to the above-mentioned purging Infusion, add of Cassia and Tamarinds extracted, with part of the same Infusion of Manna strained and of the best Sugar, each one ounce and an half; evaporate them over a gentle heat to the consistence of an Electuary. The Dose is the quantity of a Nutmeg, more or less, as it works. Take of the Species hiera picra simple, one drachm, of the best Rhubarb powder'd half a drachm, of Tartar vitriolated ten grains, of Gum Ammonieum dissolved in Vinegar fifteen grains, with a sufficient quantity of Elixir Proprietatis, of Paracelsus, make a mass for Pills, of which half a scruple or a scruple may be made into Pills, and taken at Bed-time. A Bochet made of Rhubarb and yellow Sanders, in convenient distilled Waters, may be used. If the Sick be affected with Worms or the King's Evil, or if there be any suspicion of the King's Evil, the following Bolus may be given by Intervals. [Page 445](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/424:5.6?vid=65404)Take of Mercurius Dulcis, from six to ten grains, Rosin of Jalap, or of Scammony two or four grains, of the chymical Oil of Juniper, one drop; make a Powder, which may be made into a Bolus with the pap of a roasted Apple, or a drachm of the Conserve of Violets; let it be taken early in the morning. Or, Take of Mercurius Dulcis, six or ten grains, of the Conserve of flowers of Succory, half a drachm; mix them, make a Bolus. Let it be taken early in the morning, drinking presently upon it a sufficient dose of the purging Infusion or Syrup. Chyrurgical Remedies. After gentle Purging, if the Sick be of a sanguine Constitution, Blood-letting is of use. Our Empericks use to draw a small quantity of Blood by scarifying the lobe of the Ear; which operation they rather perform with a blunt Knife, than with a sharp Lancet; and they repeat it twice or thrice, intermitting about the space of 7 days. Altho' Practitioners greatly praise this way by Scarification, I do not know but Leeches may be more effectual. Neither do I think it is to be fear'd that the sucking of Leeches should cause a greater afflux of Blood to the Head. For whatever Blood is drawn to the part by their Sucking, is also evacuated by it; and as to the greater afflux of Blood, by reason of the emptying of the Vessels, the same happens in bleeding by the Lancet. Issues are also very effectual in this Disease, especially an Issue made between the first and second Vertebrae of the Neck. The usefulness of Issues consists in that they are very effectual to evacuate the superfluous ferosity of the Brain, and also to lessen the irregular form of it, and likewise to dry up the too great moisture of the spinal Marrow, and consequently to strengthen the Nerves that arise from thence. A Seton may be put in the place of an Issue. [Page 446](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/425:5.6?vid=65404)As to Vesicatories, it is not to be doubted, but that they give ease being applied upon the Vertebres of the Neck or behind the Ears. But their Strength is soon gone, and the use of them seems to be both troublesom and painful to Children. Moreover, Cupping-glasses, without Scarification, apply'd along the Back-bone are very effectual to correct the moist and cold Temperies of the spinal Marrow, and to remove the dulness of the Nerves. And I think also that they may be applyed upon the upper Vertebres of the Neck, with a light Scarification. Besides Purging and Chyrurgical Remedies, Specifick altering Medicines are to be used, to which sometimes Diureticks and Diaphoreticks are to be added; of which we shall add some Examples. The specifick Remedies, that are found most effectual to cure this Distemper, are either simple or compound; among Simples, the following are most approved. Wood of Guiacum and its bark, Sassafras, Lentiskwood, Rosemary, the knotty parts of Firr, the roots of China, of Sarsaparilla, the three Sanders, the roots of Osmund-royal, or rather the Cloves of the roots; the roots of Sea-fern, or rather the buds of them; Grass-roots, the roots of Asparagus, Eryngo, Succory, Burdock, the barks of the roots Sage, of Rosemary, Betony, dead Nettle and of Tamarisk; also Steel prepared, or its Salt or Vitriol. Tartar, Castor, flowers of Sulphur, Earthworms, Millepides prepared, and the like. Of which Compositions may be made after this manner: Take of the Cloves of the roots of Osmund-royal, or the roots of Sea-fern, or the Twigs of the roots of it scarcely sprung above Ground, onehandful; boil them in a pint of Milk or Spring-water to the consumption of a third part. Let the strained Liquor, sweetened with Sugar, be drunk twice or thrice a day. [Page 447](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/426:5.6?vid=65404)Take of the leaves of Tea, one drachm, of the flowers of Sage, Betony, each half a drachm; put them in a convenient Vessel, and pour upon them a pint of boiling Water, let them stand close and warm about an hour. Sweeten the strained Liquor with Sugar, and let it be drunk in the same manner as the former. Take of the Cloves of the roots of Osmund-royal, of the roots of Burdock, Grass succory, each one ounce, of the herbs Male-speedwel, Agrimony, Hartstongue, Liverwort, Maiden-hair, each half an handful, of the raspings of Ivory and Hartshorn, each an ounce, of Raisins of the Sun stoned, one ounce; boil them in two quarts of Fountain-water, to the consumption of a third part, add of White-wine or Rhenish-wine, half a pint; strain it presently, and then add to it of the leaves of Water-cresses and Brooklime, and of the tops of Fir, each half an handful, of Juniperberries, half an ounce; make a warm Infusion in a close Vessel for about two hours; keep the strained Liquor in a Glass well stopt, and sweeten it at pleasure. The dose is two or three ounces at nine in the morning, at three in the afternoon, and six in the evening. Take of Lignum Lentiscinum, Rosemary, of the roots of Sarsaparilla, flowering Fern, or of male Fern, each three ounces, of the herbs Agrimony, Maiden-hair, Speedwel, Hartstongue, Sage, Bettony, each two handfuls, teps of Fern and Tamarisk, each 2 handfuls, boil them in four Gallons of Ale till one is consumed; when it has done working in the Vessel, put into a bag 200 Millepides washed in Whitewine, and gently bruised, of Juniper-berries, two ounces, of Nutmegs cut number two, hang the bag in the Vessel, and put a piece of Steel into it to make it sink. If there be any suspicion of the Scurvy, you may add of Water-cresses and Brooklime, each two handfuls; after a fortnight, let it be drunk for the ordinary drink. [Page 448](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/427:5.6?vid=65404)But the Medicine which is most approved of in this Disease is ens veneris, five or six grains of it may be taken every night at bed time, in half a spoonful of syrup of Gillyflowers. If the Lungs are stuffed with viscid Humors, as happens often, and the Mesentery with scropholous Glandules, Balsam of Sulphur may be given, three or four drops being mixed with Sugar-candy powdered, and taken morning and evening. Sometimes the use of Steel agrees; but it must not be used in Coughs, Pleurisies, a stoppage of the Lungs and hectick Fever, and the like. To the foresaid Remedies are sometimes added Diaphoreticks, as a decoction of Guaiacum or the like, which must be taken in Bed, and Sweat must be promoted according to the strength. The Bath-water also is very proper, and is excellent to take off the swelling of the Belly. The following artificial Bath is much commended. Place the Sick in a large Vessel, and put round him warm Barly fermented, which has been a while infused in boiled Water, as is usually done for making Beer; cover him well, and let him abide in it to provoke sweat. Of the Symptoms. Regard must be had to the Symptoms coming upon this Disease, the most frequent whereof is a Loosness; for the Cure whereof gentle Catharticks, as an infusion of Rhubarb and Tamarinds, and of Sanders, or a Bolus made of them is of use: But sometimes Astringents, and gentle Opiats may be used; but Purging and sometimes Vomiting must go before. Sometimes immoderate sweating afflicts the Child, which if it follow a feverish Fit, is critical, and ought not to be rashly stop'd; but if it flow inordinately, it is a Sign that the Body is oppressed with ill Humors; and, therefore, this sort of Sweat must be corrected by a gentle Purge, especially with Rhubarb. A Vomit does also good sometimes in this case. Aperitives also, and such things as help Concoction, must not be omitted. [Page 449](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/428:5.6?vid=65404)Moreover, breeding of the Teeth difficultly is familiar to this Disease, which often occasions a Fever; in which case, gentle Evacuations, especially by Glisters must be made, tho' sometimes Purging and Vomiting gently are of use. If the Tooth be about to pierce the Gum, Nurses are wont to rub the Gum with a piece of polished Coral; but the roots of Marshmallows or sharp pointed Dock will do as well: But sometimes it is necessary to cut the Gum to make way for the Tooth, and to apply Blisters behind the Ears; and if there be great pain and watching, Hypnoticks must be used; as one or two drachms of Diacodium in a spoonful of Cowslip-water. Besides internal Medicines and chirurgical Helps, external things also must be used, as Exercises of all sorts, and if the Child be able, walking frequently; if not, he must play sitting, or be carried about in the Nurses Arms, and the like. Frictions are also good in this case, with warm Flannels; the parts to be rubb'd are the Spine, which is primarly affected, and the muscular Parts; but with this caution, that you must not rub the Bones where they stick out; but you may rub freely the concave parts of the Bones. Ligatures are also of use, which are to be made above the Knee and above the Elbow; but they ought to be soft and loose. Boots are also of use, but you must take care that they press a little upon the protuberant part of the bone, and scarce touch the cavity. Bodice are also to be used to keep the Body upright. Swinging is also necessary. Lastly, we will mention some things that are to be applied outwardly. A fomentation of all sorts of Wine, also common Aqua Vitae is very good to corroborate the nervous parts, which must be used for the weak parts and especially for the Spine; which being done, the parts must be anointed with Oil, or some proper Ointment, which we shall mention by and by, and instead of Wine, the following Decoction may be used. Take of the roots of Osmund-royal, or of male-fern three ounces, of the leaves of Bettony, Sage, Rosemary, [Page 450](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/429:5.6?vid=65404) Marjoram, Water-cresses, each one handful, of the flower of Camomel, Melilot and Elder, each one pugil, of the berries of Lawrel and Juniper, each half an ounce; boil them in a sufficient quantity of fountain Water to a quart, add of White-wine, or of common Aqua Vitae, one pint; keep the strained Liquor for use. Take of the leaves of Elder, Lawrel, Marjoram, Sage, Rosemary, Bettony and the tops of Lavender, each two handfuls, of the berries of Juniper and Lawrel, each one ounce; cut them and bruise them, and put them into a Vessel with three pound of May butter, or of fresh butter not salted, and add to them half a pint of Aqua Vitae; boil them to the consumption of the Aqua Vitae, and while the strained Liquor is hot, add half an ounce of the Oil of Nutmegs by expression, and one drachm of Peruvian balsam; mingle them, make an Ointment. Instead of May-butter, Beef, Marrow, or Deers Suet, and Oil of Worms or Oil of Foxes, each one pound and an half, may be used. The Ointments must be applied warm before a hot Fire and naked, with a warm hand, till the parts are dry. If the Belly be hard and swelled, the following Ointment must be applied. Take of the Oils of Cappers, Wormwood and Elder, each one ounce, of the Ointment above described, one ounce and an half, of Gum Ammoniacum dissolved in Vinegar, half an ounce, make a Liniment. Whilst Ointments are applied to the Hypochondres, the bowels must be handled by the Nurse. If the Lungs are affected, the Breast must be anointed with the pectoral Ointment, or with the Ointment of Marsh-mallows, or both mixed together; and at the time of Unction a little Oil of Nutmegs by expression may be mixed with it. The Nerve-Plaster, or a Plaster of Bettony may be apply'd to the Spine. [Page 451](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/430:5.6?vid=65404) CHAP. CXV. Of the Gout. THe Gout chiefly seizes those Old Men, who after they have lived the best part of their Lives tenderly, and delicately indulging themselves freely with splendid Banquets, Wine and other spiritous Liquors, at length, by reason of the sloth that always accompanies old Age, wholly omit those excercises of Body, which young Men are accustomed to. Moreover, they who are obnoxious to this Disease have large Skulls, and are most commonly of a gross habit of Body, moist and lax, and of a lusty and luxuriant Constitution, the best and richest foundation for Life. Not that the Gout only seizes those that are corpulent, for sometimes, though seldomer, it invades thin People; nor does it wait always till they are Old, for sometimes it seizes those that are in the flower of their Age, when they have receiv'd the unhappy Seeds of the Disease from their Parents, as it were ex traduce: Or if this be not the cause, they have too early us'd Venery, or have quite forsook violent Exercises that they us'd formerly. Moreover, they have great Stomachs, and have drank spirituous Liquors immoderately, and afterwards they have suddenly betook themselves to thin and cooling Liquors. I will discourse of this Disease as it proceeds regularly, and afterwards of its anomalous and uncertain Phaenomena. When the Gout is regular, it seizes the Patient most commonly after this manner, about the latter end of January, or at the beginning of February it comes suddenly and for the most part without giving any notice, except that the Patient has been troubled with indigestion and crudities of the Stomach for some Weeks before. Moreover, the Body is oppress'd and puff'd up with Wind, which daily encreases till the Fit thunders [Page 452](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/431:5.6?vid=65404) upon him; but a few days before it comes the Thighs are benummed, and there is as it were a descent of Wind through them, with convulsive motions; and the day before the Fit the Appetite is sharp, but not natural. He goes to Bed, and to sleep well, but at two a clock in the morning is wak'd by the pain, seizing either his great Toe, the Heel, the calf of the Leg or the Ankle: This pain is like that of a dislocated Bone, with the sense as it were of Water almost cold, pour'd upon the Membranes of the part affected, presently shivering or shaking follows, with a feverish disposition, the pain is very gentle but increases by degrees, (and in like manner the shaking and shivering go off) and that hourly, till towards night it comes to its height, accommodating it self neatly according to the variety of the Bones of the Tarsus and Metatarsus the Ligaments, whereof it seizes, sometimes in a manner resembling a violent stretching or tearing those Ligaments, sometimes the gnawing of a Dog, and sometimes a Pressure: Moreover, the part affected has such a quick and exquisit pain, that 'tis not able to bear the weight of the Cloaths upon it, nor hard walking in the Chamber, and the night is not only pass'd over in pain upon this account, but also by reason of the restless turning hither and thither till two or three a clock in the morning, (viz. a night and a day being spent from the first approach of the Fit) at which time the Sick has suddenly ease; and now being in a breathing sweat, he falls asleep; when he wakes, he finds the pain much abated, and the part affected swell'd; the next day, and perhaps two or three days after, if the Matter apt to degenerate the Gout is copious, the part affected will be in pain, but 'twill be eased about the Cock's crowing; within a few days the other Foot will be in pain as the former was; and if the former has left off aking, the weakness which render'd it infirm, will presently vanish. After it has vext the Feet, the Fits that follow are irregular both as to the time of invasion and duration, yet the pain always returns in the Evening and is less in the Morning; and of a series of these small Fits, consists that which is call'd a Fit of the Gout. [Page 453](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/432:5.6?vid=65404)But when the Gout is disturb'd by improper Methods, or by the obstinate continuance of the Disease, the very substance of the Body being as it were perverted to the nourishment of the Disease, and Nature unable to eliminate the same by its wonted method, then the Phaenomina are much different; for whereas the pain was hitherto only troublesom to the Feet (which are the genuine seat of the peccant Matter, and if it possesses any other parts, 'tis most certain that either the method of the Disease has been alter'd, or that the vigour of the Body is by little and little diminish'd;) now it possesses the Hands, Wrists, the Arms, the Knees and other Regions, tormenting these as much as it us'd to do the Feet; for sometimes distorting one or more of the Fingers, it makes them like a bunch of Parships, taking away the motion by degrees, and at length it generates stony Concretions about the Ligaments of the Joints, sometimes the Matter occasioning the Disease thrust upon the Arms causes a whitish swelling almost as big as an Egg, which is by degrees inflam'd; sometimes falling upon the Thigh, it feels as if there were a great weight hanging upon it, yet without any considerable pain; but, passing to the Knee, it handles that more severely. And whereas the Gout before did not use to invade before the latter end of Winter, and was wont to go off after two or three Months, now it continues upon the Sick a whole year, excepting only two or three of the hot Months. The Sick is also afflicted with many other Symptoms, as with a pain of the Hemorrhoidal Veins, and with unsavory Belchings, and upon Yawning, especially in the morning, the Ligaments of the Bones of the Metatarsus are violently pull'd; and sometimes when Yawning does not go before, the Sick just dropping asleep, suddenly feels a blow, as it were, of a Club breaking in pieces the Metatarsus. Women are very seldom troubled with the Gout, and if they are, not till they are old, or unless they are of a masculine habit of Body. [Page 454](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/433:5.6?vid=65404)As to the Cure, Bleeding, Purging and Sweating are not indicated; but the Intention of curing is to be directed to the helping Concoction. Whatsoever, therefore, assists Nature in duly performing her Offices, whether in comforting the Stomach that it may rightly concoct the nourishment, or the Blood that it may well assimulate the Chile brought into it, or the solid Parts that they may the better convert it to their proper substance, the Juices designed for their nourishment and increase. Lastly, whatever preserves the various Organs of Excretion, and the Emunctories of the Body in such a state, as that they may be able to discharge duly and orderly the Excrements of each part: This, and such like, conduce to the answering this intention, and are properly called Digestives, whether they are Medicines or a course of Diet, or Exercise, or any other of those things which are called the six Non-naturals. Medicines of this kind are those in general which moderately heat, and are bitter, or gently bite the Tongue; for they are very agreeable to the Stomach, they purify the Blood and comfort all the Parts. The Remedy which I use, is made in the following manner. Take of the roots of Angelica, sweet-smelling Flag, Master-wort, Elecampane, leaves of Southern-wood, of Camomil, Tansie, Lilly of the Vallies, English Saffron, of the seeds of Treacle, Mustard, Garden scurvy-grass, Carraways, Juniper-berries, each a sufficient quantity; let the herbs and flowers, and roots be gathered when they have most vertue in them; let them be dried, and kept in Paper-bags till they may be finely powdered: To six ounces of each well mixed, add a sufficient quantity of purified Hony and Canary-wine, to make an Electuary: Take two drachms morning and evening. Or for want of this, use the following. [Page 455](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/434:5.6?vid=65404)Take of conserve of Garden-scurvygrass, an ounce and an half, of Roman Wormwood and of the yellow rind of Oranges, each one ounce, of candied Angelica, and of Nutmegs candied, each half an ounce, of Venice Treacle, three drachms, of compound Powder of Wake robin, two drachms; make an Electuary, with a sufficient quantity of syrup of Oranges; let him take two drachms twice a day, drinking upon it five or six spoonfuls of the following water. Take of the roots of Horse-radish sliced, three ounces, of Garden-scurvygrass, twelve handfuls, of Water-cresses, Brooklime, Sage and Mint, each four handfuls, the peels of six Oranges, two Nutmegs bruised, of Brunswick Mum, six quarts; distil them in a common Still, and draw only six pints of Water for use. Among the Medicines commonly known, Venice-Treacle is the best; but because it contains a great many Species that heat too much, and besides a great deal of Opium, the Electuary above-mentioned may be more commodiously prepared of the chief heating Vegetables; but we must take care to chuse such Simples as are pleasant to the taste, for the Sick must take it a long while, viz. almost as long as he lives. Among the Simples, the Peruvian-bark is the best; for it strengthens the Blood and renders it vigorous, if some Grains of it are taken morning and evening. A Mediocrity is to be observed in Meat and Drink, so that neither more nourishment be taken in than the Stomach can concoct: Nor, on the contrary, must the Parts by too much Abstinence, be defrauded of that proportion whereby their Strength and Vigour ought to be sustained. Morever, as to the quality of the Meat, though things of easy digestion considered by themselves are to be preferred before things of hard digestion, yet regard must be had to the Patient's Palat; for we must take notice, That that which the Stomach earnestly craves for, though of difficult digestion, is sooner concocted by Nature, than that which is accounted to be [Page 456](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/435:5.6?vid=65404) of easier digestion, if it be offensive to the Stomach; but those things that are reckoned of hard digestion, are therefore to be eaten more sparingly: And, I suppose, the Patient ought to feed upon one sort of Meat at a meal; for various sorts of Flesh eaten at once, disturb the Stomach more than one sort eaten in the same quantity; as to other things besides Flesh, let him eat at pleasure, if they are not sharp, nor salted, nor spiced. As to the times of eating, a Dinner is only necessary, for the Bed being most proper to digest the Humors, that time ought not to be wasted about concocting the Meat; therefore, they that are subject to the Gout should not eat Suppers, yet they may allow themselves a large draught of small Beer; for such are inclinable to breed the Stone in the Kidnies, the concretion whereof is much hindred by such kind of Liquor drunk at this time, the Reins being cooled and cleansed thereby. The drinking of Milk or a Milk-diet, either crude or boiled without any thing else, except perhaps a piece of Bread with it once a day, has been much used this 20 years, and it has done more good to many than any other sort of Remedy for this Disease, as long as they kept to it; but as soon as they return to common Diet, though of easy digestion, the Gout returned more violently than before, and held them longer; therefore, he that intends to betake himself to this method, ought, first, to consider seriously whether he can persist in the use of it all his Life long, which perhaps is not in his power, how resolved soever he may be. For I knew a Noble Man, who after he had been dieted with Milk only a whole year with pleasure (all which time he went to Stool daily once or oftner) was forced to leave it off by reason he was suddenly bound in Body, and the temper of his Body altered, and because at length his Stomach nauseated Milk, tho' the inclination of his Mind still continued; but some Hypochondriacal People of a gross habit of Body, or who otherwise have accustomed themselves much and a long while to spirituous Liquors, can by no means bear a Milk-diet. [Page 457](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/436:5.6?vid=65404)As to Liquors, those in my opinion are best, that are neither as strong as Wine nor as weak as Water, of which sort is our London small Beer, either with or without Hops, for extreams on either hand are hurtful. But now though it may be sufficient for him that has the Gout but little and at sometimes only, to use small Beer and diluted Wine, the degree of his Disease not requiring more severe usage; yet when the whole substance of the Body is as it were degenerated into the Gout, he will be less able to conquer the Disease, who does not wholly abstain from any sort of fermented Liquors though small and mild; therefore, a dietetick Drink must be prescribed for his ordinary Drink. The following pleases me best. Take of Sarsaparilla, six ounces, of Sassafras, China and the shavings of Hartshorn, each two ounces, of Liquorish, one ounce; them in two gallons of Fountain-water for half an hour, afterwards let them stand covered in hot ashes 12 hours; afterwards boil them to the consumption of a third part: As soon as it is taken from the fire, infuse in it half an ounce of Anniseeds; after two hours strain it, and let it stand till it is clear; keep the clear Liquor in Glass-bottles for use. This Liquor is most conveniently us'd at first when the Patient recovers of the Fit, and he must persevere in the use of it all the rest of his Life, as well when he has the Fits as at other times; at the same time the foresaid Electuary must be us'd daily, as well in the Fits as when they are off. Yet if the Sick, by reason of a long and too great use of intoxicating Liquors, or by reason of old Age or Weakness cannot concoct his Meat without Wine or some other fermented Liquor, he cannot leave it off suddenly without great danger, the doing whereof has been fatal to very many; therefore, in my Opinion, he shou'd not use the dietetick Apozem at all. [Page 458](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/437:5.6?vid=65404)The Sick must go to bed early; for besides Bleeding and Purging, nothing does so much destroy the strength of Nature as watching a-nights. Moreover, Tranquility of Mind must by all means be obtain'd; but the exercise of the Body is more profitable than all other things that are us'd to hinder the indigestion of the Humors, and to corroborate the Blood and to restore strength to the parts; but unless 'tis used daily 'twill do no good, yet it must not be violent. As to the kind of Exercise, riding on Horseback, when old Age and the Stone do not hinder, is much to be preferrd before the rest; if this cannot be used, riding in a Coach does almost as well: And on this account, at least, it is well with gouty People, for their Riches, which enticed them to Luxury, whereby the Disease was bred, can provide them a Coach, which kind of exercise they may use, when they cannot the other: But it is to be observed, that it is best to use exercise in a good Air, viz. in the Country, and not in the City, where the Air is filled with Vapors exhaling from the Shops of various Artificers, and thickned by the closeness of the Buildings, as it is here in London, which is generally supposed to be the largest City in the whole World. As to Venery, old and gouty People must not indulge themselves in it. But notwithstanding what has been said of the utility of exercise in the Fits of the Gout; if the Sick, by reason of the violence of the Fit is as it were overwhelmed presently by the first assault of it, which happens to those, for the most part, in whom the Gout has now come to its height, nor is yet grown gentle by a course of many years; In this case, if the Sick is confined to a Chamber, it will also be convenient that he keep his bed for some of the first days, till the violence of the pain is abated; for the bed does somewhat supply the want of Exercise: For the continual use of it does more powerfully digest the morbisick Matter in a few days, than keeping up in many, especially at the beginning of the Disease, if the Sick can abstain from Flesh without fainting or other ill Symptoms, and can be contented only with Barly-broath, small Beer, and the like. But [Page 459](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/438:5.6?vid=65404) you must take notice, that if the Gout is inveterate and inclines the Sick to Fainting, Gripes and Loosness, and such kind of Symptoms, he will scarce avoid being destroyed by one of the Fits, if he do not use Exercise in a free and open Air; for a great many gouty People, perish by these Symptoms, whereunto they have been obnoxious by being confin'd to their Chambers, and especially to their Beds, whereas had they bore the fatigue of riding in a Coach the greatest part of the day, they had not died so soon. But as to the Symptoms of the Gout, we must apply our selves to those whereby the Life of the Patient is endangered, viz. the debility and faintness of the Stomach with Gripes of the Belly; for the Sickness and faintness, a small draught of Canary Wine is very good. But if any great Symptom, scarce bearing a truce, comes suddenly, by reason of striking in of the gouty Matter, and threatens Death, we must neither trust to the Wine nor to the Exercise above commended; but in this case, if it does not fall upon the Head, but upon the natural or vital Parts, we must presently fly to Laudanum, viz. give 20 drops of liquid Laudanum, mixed with a small draught of Epidemick Water, and let the Patient compose himself to rest in his Bed. But if the Matter occasioning the Gout produces a Loosness, because it is not yet cast upon the Limbs, if it be not the crisis of a particular Fit, and if notwithstanding the Laudanum above commended, and Exercise of all sorts (for these must be first used for the cure of the Diarrhaea) the Loosness continues accompanied with Sickness and Gripes, there is only one Remedy that I know of, viz. to provoke Sweat by a method, and Medicines designed for this use, which if it be done two or three days, Morning and Evening, for two or three hours at a time, it most commonly stops the Loosness, and forces the Disease upon the Limbs. There is another Symptom not so frequent, though I have seen it divers times, viz. a translation of the peccant Matter upon the lobes of the Lungs, when a Winter-cough, by reason of cold taken in the time of the Fit, has by degrees drawn the Matter upon the Lungs. In this one case, the curative Indication is not to be directed [Page 460](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/439:5.6?vid=65404) to the Gout, but this Symptom is to be treated as a true Peripneumonia, by Bleeding repeated, and cooling and thickning Remedies and Diet. Moreover, the Sick must be purged betwixt the Bleedings; but Sweating does hurt in this case. Moreover, it is to be noted, That almost all gouty People, when they have been conflicted a long while with this Disease, are subjected to the Stone in the Kidnies, most commonly at the declination of a general Fit. In this case, setting aside all other Medicines, let him presently take a Gallon of Posset-drink, wherein two ounces of the roots of Marshmallows have been boiled, and let the following Glister be injected. Take of the roots of Marshmallows and Lillies, each one ounce, of the leaves of Mallows, Pellitory of the Wall, Bears-breech, and of the flowers of Camomil, each one handful, of Flax and Fenugreek-seeds, each half an handful; boil them in a sufficient quantity of Water; dissolve in the strained Liquor, of brown Sugar and syrup of Marshmallows, each two ounces; mingle them, and make a Glister. As soon as he has rendred all the Posset-drink by Vomiting, and has ejected the Glister, let him take a large dose of liquid Laudanum, viz. 25 drops, or 15 grains of Mathew's Pill. If any one inquires for external Remedies to ease the pain of the Gout, I have hitherto known none, excepting things meerly cooling and repelling, which are very dangerous; and I confidently affirm, That the greatest part of those who have perished in the Gout, have not so properly been killed by the Disease, as by an improper use of Medicines; therefore, if the pain be very violent, it will be better for the Sick to keep himself a bed till the pain is a little abated, than to use external Anodynes. But it will not be amiss to take a little Laudanum in the Evening, if the pain is intollerable, otherwise it will be better to omit it. [Page 461](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/440:5.6?vid=65404) CHAP. CXVI. Of a Rheumatism. THIS Disease comes at any time, but especially in the Autumn, and it chiefly seizes those that are in the flower of their Age, and it begins most commonly upon the following occasion, viz. the Sick catches Cold after having been much heated with violent Exercise, or any other way. It begins with Shaking, and Shivering and Heat, Restlessness, Thirst, and the other unhappy train of Symptoms which accompany Fevers, follow, after a day or two, and sometimes sooner, the Sick is seized with a violent pain sometimes in one Limb, sometimes in another in the Wrists, Shoulders, Knees especially, which changing place, seizes them by turns, redness and swelling remaining in the part which was last affected. There is another sort of this Disease, though it is commonly thought of another kind, it may be properly called Lumbago Rheumatica, viz. a violent and fixed pain about the region of the Loins, which sometimes reaching to the Os sacrum, resembles the Stone in the Kidnies, only the Sick does not vomit. This violent pain, unless it be removed in the same manner the former is, lasts as long, and is full as painful. Having seriously considered that this Disease arises from an Inflammation, I thought it was probable it might be cured by a simple cooling Diet moderately nourishing, as well as by Bleeding repeated, and a Whey-diet I found did as well as Bleeding. Mr. Malthus, an Apothecary, an honest and ingenious Man, was seized violently with a Rheumatism; and because he was of a weakly and dry habit of Body, I was afraid he would not be able to bear large Bleeding; and therefore I ordered, That he should be dieted with Whey alone for four days: Afterwards, besides [Page 462](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/441:5.6?vid=65404) the Whey, I allowed him white Bread for Dinner; being contented with this Diet, he continued it for 18 days, only at last he eat Bread for Supper also. He drank daily four quarts of Whey; afterwards, when he went abroad, he eat Chicken, and other things of easy digestion; but every third day he was dieted with Whey only, till he was quite well. But how well soever a Whey-diet may agree with young People, and with those that live temperately, it is not safe to treat old People so, or such as have too much addicted themselves a long while to Wine, and other spirituous Liquors, for in such it will weaken the Stomach and chill the Blood, and so cause a Dropsie. In this case, therefore, it is necessary to bleed twice or thrice, and after the second, or at most after the third Bleeding, to purge very often till all the Symptoms quite cease with Lenitives, as with Tamarinds, Sena, Rhubarb, Manna and syrup of Roses solutive; and you must give, every night after Purging, one ounce of Diacodium, somewhat earlier than is usual. But here we must take notice of a Symptom like a Rheumatism, which also sometimes resembles a nephritick pain, but it proceeds from an Ague, and must be cur'd as that is. There is also another sort of Rheumatism which comes near the Scurvy, and requires in a manner the same Cure; and, therefore, I call it a scorbutick Rheumatism; the pain seizes sometimes this, sometimes that part, but seldom swells; nor is it accompanied with a Fever, nor is it so fixt, but is of a more wandering and uncertain disposition, and accompanied with irregular Symptoms: Sometimes it seizes this or that Member, and then presently it affects only the inner Parts, and occasions Sickness, which goes off again, when the pain of the external Parts returns, and so afflicts the Patient by turns, and continues a long while like those Diseases that are accounted most Chronical, it chiefly seizes Women, and Men of a weakly nature. They who for a long while have us'd the Peruvian-bark are subject to this Disease, which, by the by, is the only inconvenience I ver knew follow upon the use of this Remedy; but, however it be, whether the [Page 463](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/442:5.6?vid=65404) Disease take its rise on this occasion, or from any other cause, 'tis very easily cur'd by the following Remedies; which should have been kept secret, if I had a greater regard to my private Advantage than to the publick Good; for by these alone, I have cured many Afflicted after the manner I have described. Take of fresh Conserve of Garden scurvy-grass, two ounces, of Wood-sorrel, one ounce, of the compound Powder of Wake-robin, six drachms; make an Electuary, with a sufficient quantity of syrup of Oranges. The dose is two drachms, to be taken thrice a day for a month, drinking upon it three ounces of the following Water. Take of Garden scurvy-grass, eight handfuls, of Water-cresses, Brook-lime, Sage and Mint, each four handfuls, of the peels of six Oranges, of Nutmegs bruised half an ounce; infuse them in six quarts of Brunswick-mum, and distil them in a common Still, and draw off three quarts for use. The precise dose of the compound Powder of Wake-robin must be observed, or, at least, it must not be lessened. [Page 464](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/443:5.6?vid=65404) CHAP. CXVII. Of the Pestilential Fever, and of the Plague of the years 1665 and 1666. THE Plague rarely rages violently in England oftener than once in the space of 30 or 40 years: The last dreadful Plague destroyed 8000 in the space of a Week, notwithstanding that two thirds, at least, of the Citizens of London fled into the Country for fear of the Infection. Its first approach was always accompanied with shaking and shivering like the Fits of an Ague, presently violent Vomitings, a pain about the region of the Heart as if it were pressed, a burning Fever, with the usual concourse of Symptoms perpetually molest the Sick, till either Death it self, or a happy eruption of a Bubo or Parotis, discharges the morbifick Matter, and so frees them from that deplorable condition. It does, indeed, now and then happen, but it is seldom that it comes without any sense of a Fever before, and suddenly destroys Men, the Purple-spots, which are the Fore-runners of present Death, breaking out, as they are about their Business. It sometimes also happens, That Tumors appear, when neither a Fever, nor any other grievous Symptom went before. As to the Cure, if a Tumour has not broke out, I bleed moderately with respect to the strength and temperament of the Sick, and afterwards a Sweat is easily and soon raised (whereas otherwise it is not only very difficulty procured, but there is also danger, lest the Inflammation should be heightned by it, and so the Tokens forced out) and the benefit of the Sweat immediately following abundantly, compensates the loss of Blood, which how little soever it be, would otherwise be very injurious. After Bleeding, which must be performed [Page 465](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/444:5.6?vid=65404) in Bed (when all things are in a readiness to promote Sweat) without any manner of delay; I order the Patient to be covered quite over with Cloaths, and that a piece of Flannel be bound to the forepart of his Head; and, indeed this covering of the Head conduces more to the procuring Sweat than any one would easily imagine; afterwards, if the Patient does not vomit, I give these and the like Sudorificks. Take of Venice Treacle, two drachms, of the Electuary of the Egg, one scruple, of compound Powder of Crabs Eyes, twelve grains, of Cochinel, eight grains, of Saffron, four grains, with a sufficient quantity of the juice of Kermes; make a Bolus, which let him take every sixth hour, drinking after it six spoonfuls of the following Julep. Take of Carduus water, compound Scordium water, each three ounces; of Treacle water two ounces; mingle them, make a Julep. But if the Patient be troubled with Vomiting, as he is very frequently in the Plague and other pestilential Fevers, I defer the giving of Sudorificks so long as till he begins to Sweat by means of the covering only, excepting that sometimes I put part of the Sheet over the Face to collect the Vapors, for (which is indeed very well worth Observation) when the Rays of the morbifick Matter extend themselves to the circumference of the Body, the Loosness and Vomiting that were occasioned by their being inwardly reflected and cast upon the Stomach and Bowels, cease presently of their own accord; so that how great soever the preceding subversion of the Stomach was, the Medicines that are taken afterwards are easily retained, and procure Sweat as well as can be wished. I order, That the Sweat should be continued for the space of a natural day, by Sage-posset-drink or Maceale, now and then taken; and I strictly forbid, That the Patient should be any way cleansed; neither indeed do I permit, that the Shirt, how moist and foul soever it be, should be changed within the space of 24 hours [Page 466](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/445:5.6?vid=65404) from the end of the Sweat, which I would have observed with the greatest caution. But if the Sweat be circumscribed in a narrower compass of time, the violence of the Symptoms soon returns, and the health of the Patient is very uncertain, which a longer continuance of the Sweat would have put out of danger. If any defection be perceived towards the latter end, I permit the Sick to take a little Chicken-broath, the yolk of an Egg or the like, which with Cordials and Draughts commonly used to keep up the Sweat, abundantly repair the Strength. I admonish, that Cold be carefully avoided, that their Cloaths dry on their Body of their own accd, and that all Drinks are taken somewhat hot, and that the use of Sage-posset-drink be continued for the space of 24 hours after the Sweat. The next morning I give a common Purge, viz. of the infusion of Tamarinds, of the leaves of Sena, of Rhubarb, Manna and syrup of Roses solutive; and with this method, the next year after the Plague, I recovered very many that were seized with the Pestilential Fever, so that not one died of this Disease that was under my care, after I began the use of the same. But where the Tumor has been out already, I have not hitherto ventured to bleed, though in a Body unapt to sweat, fearing least the sudden death of the Patient should prevent the designed sweat, by reason of the morbifick Matter flowing back to the empty Veins; yet perhaps Bleeding may be very safely administred, if a sweat be procured presently after it, without any manner of delay, which being prolonged to the space above required, may be able to dissipate and consume by little and little the whole bulk of the Humor, and with much less danger than when a legitimate maturation of the Imposthume (which is very uncertain and fallible in so very acute a Disease) is long waited for. [Page 467](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/446:5.6?vid=65404) CHAP CXVIII. Of the regular Small-Pox. THere are two sorts of them; either they are Distinct or Confluent. The Distinct begin with a shivering and coldness, which is presently follow'd with excessive heat, a violent pain in the Head and Back, Vomiting, a great propensity to Sweat; I mean in grown Persons, for I never yet observed any such disposition in Children, either before or after they came out; a pain at the cavity of the Breast, beneath the region of the Heart, if it be pressed with the Hand, dulness and sleepiness, especially in Children, and sometimes Convulsive Fits; and if these happen to them that have all their Teeth, I reckon the Small-Pox are at hand, which most commonly coming out a few Hours after, sufficiently answer the Prognostication: For instance, if the Child has a Convulsive Fit in the Evening, as it usually happens, the Small-Pox appear the next Morning; and moreover I have very often observ'd, that when they come immediately after these Fits, they rise in large Pustles, and are mild and favourable, and seldom flux: And these for the most part were the Symptoms which accompanied this Disease at its beginning, and preceded the eruption of the Pustles. But here it is proper to acquaint you, that sometimes it happened so, that in a looser texture of the Blood, which is easily changed, the course of separation was passed over gradually without any violent sickness, before the expulsion of the Matter discover'd it self, by the eruption of the Pustles. [Page 468](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/447:5.6?vid=65404)The Distinct Small-Pox usually come out on the fourth day inclusively, and sometimes a little later, but rarely before, at which time, for the most part, the symptoms are very much abated, or totally vanish, and the Patient thinks himself very well; only grown People are so disposed to Sweat, that they can scarce be kept from it, though they have little or no Cloaths on them, which disposition does not leave them till the Pustles begin to ripen, and then it vanishes of its own accord: The eruption is after this manner, first Pimples as big as small Pins heads here and there shew themselves, and first of all in the Face, Neck and Breast, and afterwards in the whole Body. At this time the Jaws are affected with a pain that increases as the Pustles rise, which growing daily bigger and higher, inflame the neighbouring skin and Flesh; for about the eighth day from the first approach of the Sickness, which I always diligently observe in this Disease, the spaces between, that before were somewhat white, now begin to be red and swell more or less, according to the number of the Pustles, with a tensive and launcing pain of these Parts, which increasing, hourly occasions the Inflammation and Swelling; so that in progress of this Disease the Eye-lids are so filled up and extended, that the Patient is sometimes depriv'd of Sight, and when they are thus Tumified, they shine and are like a Bladder blowed up; and if a greater number of Pustles besiege the Eyes at the first eruption, they sooner retire to their dark Mansions; next after the Face, the Hands and Fingers, swell more or less, according to the number of the Pustles: The Pustles that were smooth and red to this day, are now grown rough and somewhat white, which is indeed the first sign of their coming to maturity; moreover, they cast out by degrees a certain yellowish Matter, in colour like a Hony-comb, and the inflammation of the Face and hands, when it is at height, causes a very florid Colour, not unlike a Damask-Rose, in the spaces between the Small-Pox. On the Eleventh the Tumour and Inflammation of the Face manifestly diminish, and on the Fourteenth or Fifteenth day totally vanish. [Page 469](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/448:5.6?vid=65404)That sort of Small-pox which we call the Flux, has the same Symptoms with the Distinct, only they are more violent; the Sickness, the Vomiting, the Fever, and the Restlesness, rage more violently: Moreover, a Loosness sometimes precedes the Eruption, and continues a day or two after it. This sort comes out generally on the third day, sometimes before, scarce ever after it. But it is to be Noted, when some grievous Symptom afflicts the Patient before the eruption, as a most violent pain, sometimes in the region of the Loins, like a fit of the Stone; sometimes in the Side, like a Pleurisie, sometimes in the Limbs, like a Rheumatism; lastly in the Stomach, with violent Sickness and Vomiting; In these cases I have observed the Small-pox to come out later than ordinary. And in the nex place, I must acquaint you, that the Fever and other symptoms molest the sick many days after the coming out of the Pustles. This sort comes out sometimes like an Erysipelas, sometimes like the Measles, and as to the outward appearance they cannot be distinguished by any but those that are very conversant in this Distemper; yet he that shall diligently consider the great difference as to the time of eruption in these Diseases, and other Circumstances which he may gather from the History of each of them, will easily be able to distinguish them. These do not rise so high as the Distinct, especially those in the Face; after the eighth day they begin to change into a duskish Colour. There are two other Symptoms that attend the Flux-pox, which are as considerable as the Pustles or Swelling, viz. Salivation in grown People, and a Loosness in Children. The first of these is so perpetual a Concomitant, that I never knew but one that had the Confluent kind and was free from Salivation; but the latter, viz. a Loosness, does not so certainly vex Children that have this sort. Sometimes Salivation discovers it self at the first coming out, sometimes not till a day or two after; first the matter is thin and easily spit up, so that the sick foul a great many Cloaths in a nights time; but about the Eleventh day it is most commonly [Page 470](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/449:5.6?vid=65404) more clammy, so that it is difficulty hawked up, the Sick is thirsty, and now and then coughs as he drinks. A Loosness does not invade Children so soon, as spitting does old People; but at what time soever it comes, if it be not stopped by Art, it continues through the whole course of the Disease. In both kinds of small Pox, the Fever is highest from the beginning to the eruption; after which it is more moderate, till the Pustles begin to ripen, and afterwards it totally evanishes. I have always observed, that when the disease was violent, the sick had, as it were, a Fit in the evening; and then the Symptoms raged more cruelty. In the next place I will treat of the irregular Symptoms that happen in this disease, when it is unskilfully handled. It is to be noted, therefore, that the irregular Symptoms that occur on the eight Day, in the distinct small Pox, and those that happen on the eleventh in the Flux, always reckoning from the first approach of the Disease, are of very great moment with respect either to the Life or Death of the patient; and, therefore, they ought to be exactly weighed; for it is manifest that the greatest part of those that die of either sort, die on the days above-mentioned. When Sweat is promoted much by Cordials and hot Regimen, the Particles are eliminated, which should have served to elevate the Pustles, and to swell the Face on the Eight Day; and it appears flaccid and white, and the Sweat, which flowed freely to this day, now ceases of its own accord, nor it can it be raised again with the hottest Cordials: The patient is taken lightheaded of a sudden, with Anxiety, violent Sickness and restlessness, he makes Water often, but little at a time, and in the space of a very few hours, takes leave of his Friends, and repairs to his long home. But in the Flux the Sick is in the greatest danger, and most commonly dies on the 11th Day; for the Salivation which hitherto preserved the Patient is wont to cease of its own accord at this time: Therefore, unless the swelling of the Face persists a little longer, [Page 471](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/450:5.6?vid=65404) and that of the Hands now manifestly beginning supplies it's place, the sick must necessarily perish: But it happens too often in this hot Disease, that the Crass of the blood being weakened, and broke by an over-hot Regimen, and being so highly inflamed, that it is no longer able to exterminate leasurely the inflammatory Particles, (to say nothing at present of those Mischiefs that are occasioned by sweat unseasonably forced) so that either the Face or Hands do not swell at all, or the Tumour vanishes with the Salivation. There are yet other symptoms that happen at any time of the Disease, and belong as well to the distinct small Pox as the Flux. As a Frensie, a Coma and Purple Spots, which are most commonly the forerunners of Death; and sometimes there is a bloody Urin, or Blood is cast up from the Lungs, both these Hemorrhages happen most commonly at the beginning of the Disease, before the Pustles come out; sometimes also there is a total suppression of Urine. There are also other symptoms that sometimes arise from a cause contrary to those above mention'd, when the Patient has been injured by violent Cold or excessive Bleeding, or by being over purg'd, viz. the Pustles fall of a sudden, and a Loosness supervenes, so that the Patient, if he be Adult, is in great danger; moreover, the Tumour of the Face and Hands is repell'd on this account. But the Symptoms that proceed from taking Cold very rarely occur, for what those do that are occasioned by too hot a Regimen. As soon as the Signs of this Disease shew themselves, I keep the sick from the open Air, and forbid them the use of Wine and Flesh, and allow them small Beer gently warmed with a Tost for their ordinary Drink, and now and then permit them to drink as much of it as they will, I order them for their Victuals, Oatmeal and Barly Broaths, and rosted Apples, and other things, which are neither too hot nor cold, nor too hard to be digested; I forthwith prohibit a hot Regimen and the use of all manner of Cordials. On the fourth day I commit the sick to his Bed; and then if they come not out well, some gentle Cordial may be properly prescribed, [Page 472](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/451:5.6?vid=65404) at least for once, to drive out the Pustles. Among the Medicines for this purpose, those they call Paregoricks, such as liquid Laudanum, Diascordium, and the like, if they be mixed in a small quantity with some proper cordial Waters excell the rest: But it is to be noted, That if I am call'd to a strong young Man, who has besides given occasion to the Disease by excessive drinking of Wine, or any Spirituous Liquor whatsoever, I reckon it not sufficient for the restraining of the ebullition of the Blood, that he abstrain from his Bed and Cordials; unless, moreover, he be blooded in the Arm. When the Pustles first come out, I then diligently consider whether they be of the distinct or confluent kind, because they differ exceedingly one from the other, though they agree as to some symptoms. If, therefore, from the bigness and paucity of the Pustles, and the slowness of their coming out, and from the vanishing of sickness and other symptoms, which tire the Patient after the eruption of the flux Pox, it appear that they are the distinct sort, I take care that the sick be refreshed with small Beer, Oatmeal and Barly-gruel, and the like. And if the small Pox be but few, and in Summer-time, and that very hot, I see no reason why the Patient should be kept stifled up in Bed, and why he may not rather rise a few hours every day, provided the inconveniencies of too much Cold or Heat may be prevented by the place and cloathing; but if either the cold season of the Year, or a large eruption of the Pustles, put the Patient under a necessity of keeping his Bed continually, I take care that he lie not hotter nor has more Cloaths on him than when he was in health, and that he have a Fire kindled only morning and evening, unless it be Winter; nor do require that he should be always fixed to one place, lest he sweat, which I confidently affirm cannot be promoted without great danger. When the Disease is going off, it is proper to give three or four spoonfulls of Canary-Wine hot, or some other temperate Cordial Medicine. At the same time also, a little hotter and more Cordial-diet may be allowed. For instance, Sugar-sos, and Oatmeal-candie [Page 473](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/452:5.6?vid=65404) and the like; nor is there need of any other thing at all in the distinct and gentle sort, if the Patient will suffer himself to be treated moderately in this method and diet, unless by change Restlessness, or Watchings, should now and then persuade the use of a Paregorick. But if the small Pox Flux, the case is very hazardous; for I reckon this sort is no less different from the other than the Plague is from this; though among the Vulgar, who take names and words for things, the cure of both is said to be the same; for towards the end of the disease the sick is in great danger, viz. on the 11th Day in the common Flux-pox, on the 14th Day in a worser sort, and the 17th Day in the worst sort: But sometimes, though rarely, one the 21st Day, the Fever, the Restlessness and other symptoms invading together, whereby the sick is generally destroyed, unless Art relieve him: Wherefore, seeing there is so much danger when they Flux, the Physician should endeavour all he can to hinder their Fluxing, by bleeding presently in the Arm, if there be the least suspicion of the Flux-pox, and by giving a Vomit afterwards, and by keeping the sick up till the 6th Day from the first sickness. Afterwards he must be put to Bed, and keep there to the end of the disease; but he must have no more Cloaths on, nor a greater fire in his Chamber than he used to have when he was well, and he must drink freely of small Beer or other cooling Liquors. But because, notwithstanding the sick frequently grows hot, lightheaded, and restless, I give an Anodyne every Night, but a little earlier than is usual; because in this Disease, a fit of heat and restlessness comes almost every day towards the evening. But, which is to be lamented, notwithstanding these things, and all other Physical Helps, the sick is very often seized on the 11th Day, or on some other of those Days, which we said, were most fatal in the various kinds of Flux-pox, with a violent Fever, difficulty of breathing, and restlessness, and dies suddenly. In this case nothing is more effectual than the taking away of ten or twelve ounces of Blood, and in the evening a large Anodine must be given, as before; and so [Page 474](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/453:5.6?vid=65404) afterwards morning and evening, and sometimes oftener; for it is diligently to be noted, that in some the fury of the Disease is so high, that a very large dosed Anodyne cannot stop its force in 12 hours; in which case it is necessary to repeat the Anodyne every 6th or every 8th hour. But because it happens often at the latter end of the Disease, that the Body is bound up so much, that the sick is like to be suffocated, and consequenrly is in great danger; in this I have given successfully an ounce and an half of Lenitive Electuary dissolved in four ounces of Succory-water or the like; which Draught gives some stools before night; but if it does not, an Anodyne must be given in the evening, and sooner, notwithstanding the Purge, if great Restlessness or some considerable sickness threaten danger. If, therefore, the Purge does not answer the first day, it must be repeated the next, and then it seldom fails, and in this manner Bleeding and Purging may be repeated by Intervals, as occasion requires. But it is to be noted, that the sick must not be purged till the 13th day or after, nor then, unless Bleeding has gone before. For spitting of Blood and a bloody Urine coming upon the small Pox, for both these Hemorraghes come sometimes at the beginning of the Disease: After bleeding largely once, give an Anodyne. Take of red Poppy water, two ounces, of liquid Laudanum, 14 drops, of distill'd Vinegar, three drachms, of Diacodium, half an ounce; make a Draught to be repeated every night at bed time. Take of Troches of Lemnian Earth and of Bole-armenick, each one drachm, of sealed Earth, Bloodstone, Dragon's-blood and red Coral prepared, each half a drachm, of Mastich and Gum-arabick, each one scruple; mingle them, make a fine Powder, whereof let him take half a drachm every third hour in a spoonful of syrup of Comfry, drinking upon it four or five spoonfuls of the following Julep. [Page 475](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/454:5.6?vid=65404)Take of the Waters of Plantain and Oak-buds, each three ounces, of Cinnamon-water Hordeate, two ounces, of syrup of dried Roses, one ounce; make it a little acid with spirit of Vitriol. Emulsions also of the four greater cold Seeds with white Popies do a great deal of good. But after the Hemorrhage is stopt, you must proceed according to the method described in the small Pox. Great care must be taken that the Salivation continue according to the manner of it, from the beginning to the 12th or 13th day; for if it quite stop before the 11th day, the Sick is in great danger: It may be much promoted by ordering the Sick to drink freely small Beer, or any other Liquor, which is neither heating nor provokes sweat. In the next place the Loosness in Children must be permitted, because it evacuates the morbifick matter. At last, when the Pustles are crusty and hard, I use to anoint the Face often with Oyl of sweet Almonds. If in the distinct small Pox the Face does not swell, I give an Anodyne presently; but if the Patient be light-headed and very sick, and makes Water often, but little at a time, he can be relieved no other way, Death being near at hand, than by giving Narcoticks freely, or by taking away a large quantity of Blood, and by exposing the Body to the Air; but I would not be so understood here as if in every Phrensy coming upon the small Pox, there being no Symptom more frequent, that I should advise Bleeding presently; but only in that which therefore happens, because the Face does not swell in the distinct kind, tho' there be a great number of Pustles. If in the Flux-Pox the Spitle be so thick and clammy that the Sick is in danger of being suffocated, which happens often on the 11th day, a Gargarism must necessarly be prescibed, and must be ordered to be used often Day and Night: It may be made of small Beer or Barly-water, with Hony of Roses. Or, the following may be used. [Page 476](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/455:5.6?vid=65404)Take of the bark of Elm, six drachms, of Liquorice, half a drachm, of Raisins of the Sun ston'd number twenty, of red Roses, two pugils; boil them in a sufficient quantity of Water to a pint and an half: In the strained Liquor dissolve of simple Oxymel, and of Hony of Roses, each two ounces; mingle them, make a Gargarism. But when the sick is in danger to be suffocated every moment, and is stupid, an ounce and an half of the Infusion of Crocus Metallorum must be given, for a less Dose will not work, by reason of the stupidity of the sick. But this Remedy does not always do the business. The Coma may be easily relieved by the help of a moderate Regimen. For a Suppression of Urine, which sometimes afflicts young and brisk People, nothing does so well as taking the Sick out of Bed; and after he has walked twice or thrice cross the Room, by the assistance of the By-standers, he will presently make Water freely, and be much relieved thereby. But the Symptoms arising from catching cold, or by Evacuations unduly used, whereby the small Pox are struck in, must be removed by Cordials, and an agreeable Regimen; but they must not be continued after the Symptoms are gone off: The chief of these are a flatting of the Pustles, and a Loosness in the distinct small Pox; for in the Flux a depression of the Pustles is natural; nor is a Loosness dangerous in Children. In both these cases, a Cordial-potion made of distilled Waters, Diascordium, liquid Laudanum, and the like, is proper, not only to remove these Symptoms, but also at any time of the Disease, if the Sick complain of a pain at the Heart, or of sickness. But to speak the truth, Symptoms of this kind are very rare, compared with those which owe their original to the other extream, which is more fatal, though less blamed. When the Patient is mending, and the Pustles are falling off, after he has Meat a few days, namely, about [Page 477](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/456:5.6?vid=65404) the 21st or 22d day, I think he ought to be blooded, if the Disease has been violent; and, after Bleeding, he must be purged three or four times. But sometimes after the Sick has recovered of the Flux-Pox, and rises daily, he has great swellings in his Legs; but they either go off of themselves, or are easily cured after Bleeding and Purging, by the use of emollient and discutient Herbs boiled in Milk, as Mallows, the leaves of Mullein, Elder, Bays, with the flowers of Camomil and Melilot. The distinct irregular small Pox of the years 1670, 1671 and 1672, differed from the general distinct small Pox in the following things: First, the Eruption was generally on the third day, and then in the process of the Disease the Pustles did not arrive to a due bigness; and towards the end, when they began to ripen, they seemed black. Moreover, there was a salivation sometimes, though rarely, when there were very few Pustles: But the flux-Pox differed in many things from the other Flux-Pox; for they came out sometimes on the second, sometimes on the third day, in the form of a redish Tumour covering the whole Face, and thicker than an Erysipelas, and scarce any visible distance betwixt the Pustles, with a heap of almost infinite, red, angry Pimples running into one, and disguising the whole Body between the Pustles; especially in the Thighs appeared some little Bladders very conspicuous like a burn, and distended with clear Water, which flowed out plentifully, when the skin was broken, the Flesh underneath being black like a Mortification. But this dreadful symptom seldom happened. The Fever, and all other symptoms which either preceded or accompanied this kind of small Pox were more violent than in other sorts of Pox, and had a greater Inflammation. The free use of the white Decoction and Milk-water did a great deal of good in this sort. The Flux of the Courses, which happens often to Women when they have this Disease, requires a free use of these Liquors, if they flow at an unusual time. [Page 478](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/457:5.6?vid=65404)A Gentlewoman that had this black sort of Pox was seized with so large a Flux of the Courses at an unusual time, that the Women about her thought she had miscarried, and tho' this Symptom continued many days, yet I continually used the Milk-water through the whole course of the Disease. CHAP. CXIX. Of the Measles. THIS Disease chiefly invades Infants, and all those that are together in the same House. It begins with shaking and shivering, and with an inequality of heat and cold, which mutually expel one another the first day; the second day it ends in a perfect Fever with violent sickness, drowth and want of Appetite, the Tongue is white but not dry, there is a tickling Cough with a heaviness of the Head and Eyes accompanied with a perpetual drowsiness, and for the most part a Humour distils from the Eyes and Nose, and this effusion of Tears is a certain sign of the approaching Measles. To which this is to be added, no less certain, that tho' this Disease shews it self most commonly in the Face after the manner of little swellings in the skin, yet in the Breast rather red spots than swellings are perceived, arising no higher than the superficies of the skin; the Patient sneezes as if he had taken cold, and the Eyelids swell a little before the Eruption; he vomits, but is oftner troubled with a Loosness with greenish Stools: But this chiefly happens to Children that are breeding their Teeth, and they are frowarder in this Disease than they are wont to be for the most part; the symptoms increase till the fourth day, at which time generally, (though sometimes they are deferred) little red spots like Fleabites begin to come out about the Forehead and other parts of the Face, and being increased in number and magnitude branch into one another, and so [Page 479](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/458:5.6?vid=65404) paint the Face with large red spots of various Figures, which are occasioned by little red Wheals, not far distant one from another, that are elevated a little above the superficies of the skin, and their Protuberances may be perceived by a gentle touch, though they can scarce be seen. These spots spread themselves by degrees from the Face, which at first they only possess'd to the Breast, Belly, Thighs and Legs: But they affect the Trunk and Members with redness only, without any sensible inequality of the Skin. The symptoms of the Measles do not abate by the Eruption, as in the small Pox, yet I never observed the Vomiting afterwards; but the Cough and Fever increase, with the difficulty of Breathing, weakness of the Eyes, and the defluxion on them, with perpetual drowziness and want of Appetite, continuing the same as before. On the 6th day, or thereabouts, the Skin breaking, and the Pustles drying off, the Forehead and Face grow rough, and at that time the spots in other parts of the Body are very large and very read. About the 8th day, the spots in the Face vanish, and are scarce perceived in the rest of the Body: But on the 9th day they totally disappear, and as we said the Measles most commonly vanish on the 8th day, at which time the Vulgar, being deceived by reckoning upon the time the small Pox use to last, affirm, They are struck in, tho' really they have finished their course, and they think that these symptoms which come upon their going off are occasioned by their being struck in so soon: For it is to be noted, That the Fever and difficulty of Breathing are increased at that time, and the Cough is more vexatious, so that the Patient can neither sleep night nor day. Children are chiefly subject to these ill symptoms, which appear now at the going off of the Measles by reason of too hot a Regimen or hot Medicines that were used to force them out; and by this means they are cast into a Peripneumonia, which destroys more than the small Pox or any symptom belonging to it; and yet the Measles are not at all dangerous if they are skilfully managed. And among the rest of the ill symptoms, a Loosness often happens, which either presently succeeds the Disease, or continues many Weeks after it and all its symptoms are gone off, not without [Page 480](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/459:5.6?vid=65404) great danger to the Patient by reason of a continual loss of Spirits; and sometimes after a very hot Regimen, the Measles are first livid and afterwards black; but this only happens to grown People, and they are utterly lost when the blackness first appears, unless they are presently relieved by bleeding and a more temperate Regimen. As the Measles are much of the same nature with the small Pox, so is the method of Cure much the same. Hot Medicines and a hot Regimen are very dangerous, how frequently soever they are used by ignorant Nurses to drive the Disease from the Heart. This method, above others, has been most successful in my practice, viz. That the Patient be kept in his Bed only two or three days after the Eruption, that the blood may gently breath out, according to its own genius, through the Pores of the Skin, the inflamed Particles, which offend it; and that he have no more Cloaths nor Fire than he is wont to have when he is well: I forbid all Flesh, and allow him Oatmeal and Barly-broaths, and the like, and sometimes a rosted Apple; his Drink must be either small Beer, or Milk boil'd with treble the quantity of Water. I oftentimes mitigated the Cough, which almost continually accompanies this Disease, with a draught of some pectoral Decoction, or with a Linctus fitted for the purpose; but above all the rest, I took care to give Diacodium every night through the whole course of this Disease. For Example, Take of the pectoral Decoction, one pint and an half, of syrup of Violets and Maiden-hair, each one ounce and an half; mingle them and make an Apozem, take three or four ounces three or four times a day. Take of Oil of sweet Almonds, two ounces, of syrup of Violets and Maiden-hair, each one ounce, of white Sugercandy, a sufficient quantity; mingle them and make a Linctus, of which let the Sick lick often, especially when his Cough troubles him. Take of black Cherry-water, three ounces, of Diacodium, one ounce; mingle them for a draught to be taken [Page 481](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/460:5.6?vid=65404) every night. But if the Patient be an Infant, the dose of the Pectorals and of the Narcotick is to be lessened with respect to the Age. But if by means of too hot Cordials and too hot a Regimen, the Patient be in danger of his Life after the Measles go off, which is very frequent by the violence of the Fever and the difficulty of breathing, and other Accidents that use to afflict those that have a Peripneumonia, I have bled the smallest Infants in the Arm, and have taken away that quantity of Blood which their Age and Strength indicated, with very great success; and sometimes when the Disease has been obstinate, I have repeated bleeding: The Loosness also which follows the Measles, is also cur'd by bleeding. What we have now said of the Cure of those symptoms that come upon the going off of the Measles, may be sometimes also of use when they are at their height, if they are occasioned by a false and artificial heat. I was called to visit a Maid-servant that had this Disease, together with a Fever, difficulty of Breathing, and purple spots all over her Body, with very many other dangerous symptoms; all which I attributed to the hot Regimen and hot Medicines, which were too much used. I ordered her to be bled in the Arm, and I prescribed a cooling pectoral Ptisan to be taken often; by the help of which, and a temperate Regimen, the purple Spots, and all the other symptoms vanished by degrees. [Page 482](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/461:5.6?vid=65404) CHAP. CXX. Of a continual Fever. FIRST, I observe, That the inordinate commotion of the Blood, the Cause or Companion of this Fever, is stirred up by Nature, either that some heterogenious Matter contained in it, and inimical to it, should be excluded, or that the Blood should be changed into some new disposition. I reckon that the true and natural Indications that arise in this Disease shew, That the commotion of the Blood must be kept to that degree, which is agreeable to Nature's purpose, that it does not rise too high on the one hand, from whence great symptoms flow, nor be depressed too low on the other, by which means the protrusion of the morbisick Matter may be hindred, or the endeavours of the Blood affecting a new Condition frustrated; so that whither the Fever takes its rise from heterogeneous Matter provoking it, or from the Blood affecting a new State, in either case the Indication is the same. These things being premised, I institute the method of Cure in the following manner. When I am called to Patients, whose Blood of it self is weak, as it is most times in Children, or when it wants Spirits, as in old Age, and in young Men weakned by long Diseases, I forbear bleeding; for if I should bleed such, their Blood being already too weak, it would be rendred altogether unfit to perform the business of Despumation. But when I have to do with those whose Blood is of a contrary Nature, such as is wont to be in young Men of a robust Constitution, and sanguine Complexion; I order Bleeding in the first place, which cannot be omitted here without hazard; beside, in some other cases to be mentioned hereafter; for otherwise not only Phrensies, Pleurisies and such-like Inflammations may be [Page 483](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/462:5.6?vid=65404) feared, but also by reason of the superfluity, a Stagnation of the whole Mass. As to the quantity, I only take away so much Blood as I conceive will free the Sick from such dangers he is obnoxious to by the immoderate commotion of the same; furthermore, I regulate the Estuation by repeating Bleeding, or omitting it, by using or forbidding the use of hot Cordials, and lastly by keeping the Body loose, or stopping it, as I perceive the commotion is high or low. After Bleeding, if it be necessary, according to the cases above-mentioned, I diligently enquire whether the Patient was enclined to Nauseousness at the beginning of the Fever, and if so, I presently prescribe a Vomit, unless the tender Age, or some great Weakness of the sick forbid it: Truly a Vomit is so necessary when an inclination to Vomiting has preceded, that unless that Humour be expelled, it will occasion many difficult Symptoms, that will hinder the Physician in performing the Cure, and will very much endanger the Patient; a Loosness is the chief and most usual of these, which most commonly follows in the declination of the Fever, as often as Vomits are Indicated. The Vomit I frequently use is this following. Take of the infusion of Crocus Mettalorum six Drachms, of Oxymel of Squills, and compound Syrup of Scabious, each half an ounce, mingle them, make a Vomit, which I order to be taken in the Afternoon, two hours after a light Dinner. And that the Vomit may succeed the better, I appoint six or eight pints of Posset-drink to be provided, for these Medicines are dangerous, if they are not washed off; and therefore as often as the Patient Vomits or goes to Stool, he must presently take a draught of it, by which means the Gripes will be prevented, and he will vomit easier. It is to be Noted, that if the condition of the Patient requires Bleeding and Vomiting, it is safest to bleed first, for otherwise, whilst the Vessels are distened with Blood, there is great danger, lest by violent straining [Page 484](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/463:5.6?vid=65404) to Vomit, the Vessels of the Lungs should be broken and the Brain hurt, and so the Patient may die Apoplectick, of which I could produce some Examples, if I thought it convenient; let it suffice that I warn you to use great caution in this case. If any one should ask, at what time of the Fever I would give a Vomit, I say at the very beginning, if I had my choice; for by this means, the Sick may be defended from those horrid symptoms that take their rise from the filth of those Humours that lurk in the Stomach and Neighbouring Parts, and perhaps we may crush the Disease in its beginning. But if we are called in late, as we are often, so that we cannot assist the Patient at the beginning of the Fever by prescribing a Vomit, yet I have thought it proper to order one at any time of the Disease, provided the Patient has strength enough to bear the operation of it: I have given a Vomit on the twelfth day, and I should not doubt to prescribe one later, unless the weakness of the Patient forbids. The Evening after taking the Vomit, I always endeavour to quiet the tumult raised in the Humours by the Vomit, and therefore I prescribe an Anodyne to be taken at Bed-time, for Instance, Take of Erratick Poppy two Ounces, of Aqua-Mirabilis two drachms, of Syrup of white and red Poppies, each half an ounce, mingle them, make a Draught. But if there be no fear of raising the ebullition for the future, either by reason of a great loss of Blood, or by frequent Vomiting and Stools, or by a present apurexy, or debility of the Fever, or its declining State, I boldly order a large Dose of Diascordium, either by it self, or mixed with some Cordial-water, instead of the Anodyne above-described, and it is indeed an excellent Medicine, if it be given in a due quantity. And now before I leave off discoursing of Vomits, I must acquaint you, that it is by no means safe, at least in this Fever, to give Vomits of the infusion of Crocus Metallorum to Children, or to any under Fourteen, no, not in the least quantity. [Page 485](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/464:5.6?vid=65404)The Fatigue of Vomiting being over, I further consider with my self, whether notwithstanding the preceding Evacuations, the Blood continues yet to rage so much, that it is still necessary to restrain its effervescence, or whether it be so very languid that it wants to be heightened, or lastly whether the Fermentation being reduced to a due degree, may be left to it self, without danger to the Patient. First therefore if the Blood ferments so violently, that we may reasonably suspect that the Patient is either obnoxious to a Phrensie, or any other troublesome Symptom, proceeding from too great an ebullition of the Blood; the day after taking of the Vomit, I prescribe a Glister. For Instance, Take of the common Decoction for a Glister one pint, of Syrup of Violets and Brown Sugar, each two ounces; mingle them, make a Glister. And I order it should be repeated upon occasion; by which it often happens that the Blood being somewhat ventilated and cooled, its effervescence is sufficiently bridled: But sometimes it is necessary to repeat Bleeding once and again, viz. In those of a very Sanguine Complexion, and in the flower of their Age, or in others who have imprinted on their Blood a certain inflammatory disposition, by the too frequent use of Wine: But for the most part there is no need of so great a remedy as is repeated Bleeding; and except in the cases above-mention'd, the effervescence may be sufficiently suppressed by the help of Glisters; wherefore, if the Blood ferment too much, I order a Glister to be injected every day, or every other day, as the case requires, and that it he done to the tenth day of the Disease, or thereabouts; but if much Blood has been taken away, or the Patient is Aged, I order no Glisters at that time, though the Blood be very hot; for in these cases as there is no fear that by the omission of Glisters, the ebullition begun should proceed so far as that there should be eminent danger from some violent Symptom; so it is most certain, that by the use of them, the Strength, and as I may say, the Tone of the Blood, is [Page 486](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/465:5.6?vid=65404) so much relaxed, that especially in old Men, (for Glisters are not used with so good Success in old Men as in young) Nature is obstructed in her business. But whether Bleeding has been used or omitted, if the effervescence be too languid, and wants to be stirred up; in this case we must wholly abstain from the use of Glisters, even before the tenth day, and much rather if it be past, for to what purpose should we endeavour to suppress the fermentation that is too weak already? As to Cordials, I have found by experience, that the too early use of them has been very injurious, viz. (Bleeding having not been first used) there is danger lest the crude Matter should fall upon the Membranes of the Brain, or the like, or on the Pleura; and therefore I always take care that Cordials be not given, when no Blood, or but very little has been taken away, and there has been no other considerable Evacuation, or when the Patient has not passed the flower of his Age. But if the Patient be weakned by profuse Evacuations, I use to give Cordials even at the beginning of the Fever; but on the twelfth day of the Disease, things then tending to Secretion, I suppose we ought freely to indulge the use of hotter Medicines, and indeed a little sooner, if there be no danger of driving the febrile Matter upon the principal Parts. If the Fermentation proceed well, the Despumation will be finished about the Fourteenth day. But if you use Coolers too late, and so by their means suppress the effervescence, it is not strange if the Fever continue to the Twenty first day, and much longer in feeble Bodies ill managed. The Cordials I prescribe are such as those, which I will mention by and by; those that are more moderate, I use at the beginning of the Disease, when the heat is very violent, always proceeding gradually to the use of hotter, according to the progress of the Disease, and the degrees of ebullition, always remembring that it is lawful if much Blood has been taken away, or if the Patient be Aged, to administer stronger Cordials than when bleeding has not preceded, or when the Patint was in the flower of his Age. [Page 487](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/466:5.6?vid=65404)Those Cordials I call Moderate, are made of Distilled Waters. For instance, of Borrage, Citron, Strawberries, Treacle, compound Scordium-water, mingled with the Syrup of Baum of Fernelius, of Gilliflowers, of juice of Citron and the like; but the Stronger of Gascoin's Powder, Bezoar, Confection of Hyacinth, Venice Treacle and the like. These which follow are frequently used. Take of the Waters of Borrage, Citron, compound Scordium, Black-cherries, each two ounces, Cinamon-wawater hordeated one ounce, Pearls prepared two drachms, of Christaline Sugar a sufficient quantity; mingle them, take four spoonfuls often in a day. Take of the Waters of the whole Citron and of Strawberries, each three ounces, of the cold Cordial-water of Saxony, one ounce, of Treacle-water, and of the Syrups of Baulm of Fernelius, of Gilliflowers, and of the juice of Citron, each half an ounce; mingle them, and make a Julep, of which take often. Take of Gascoin's Powder, of oriental and occidental Bezoar-stone, of each one scruple, one leaf of Gold; mix them and make a fine Powder. Take to the quantity of twelve grains when there is occasion, in the Syrup of the juice of Citron, and of Gilliflowers, each two drachms, drinking upon it a few spoonfuls of the Julep prescribed. Take of Treacle-water four ounces, of the Seeds of Citron two drachms; beat them together and make an Emulsion; add to the strained Liquor a sufficient quantity of Pearl-sugar, to make it grateful to the Taste. Take two spoonfuls three times in a day. But if the Fermentation be neither too high nor too low, I leave it in that state, and use no Remedies unless I am forced to do something by the importunity of the Sick, or his Friends about him, that may please them without obstructing my design. [Page 488](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/467:5.6?vid=65404)And now I must tell you, that when I was called to a poor Body, who was not able to be at the charge of going through a long course of Physick, I did nothing else, after Bleeding and Purging was over, if they were indicated, but order them to keep their Beds all the time of their Sickness, and to drink Oatmeal and Barly-broath, and the like, and that they should drink Small-beer warm, moderately, to quench their Thirst. I took care that they should have a Glister of Milk and Sugar every day, till the Tenth or Eleventh day, and towards the end of the Fever, separation being now begun, if it were slow, I permitted them now and then stronger drink to help it instead of a Cordial. And so without any more ado, except that I used to give a gentle Purge at the end of the Disease, I cured them. If the Patient be very weak, or if there be not a perfect Despumation, so that I cannot boldly give a Purge on the Fifteenth day, I defer it to the Seventeenth, at which time I give the following, or the like, according to the strength of the Patient. Take of Tamarinds half an ounce, of Senna two drachms, of Rhubarb one drachm and an half; boyl them in a sufficient quantity of Water; to three ounces of the strained Liquor, add Syrup of Roses solutive and Manna, each one ounce; mingle them and make a Potion. Purging being over, I order the Patient to rise, who has been hitherto kept in Bed by my prescription, and to return gradually to his accustomed Diet. It happens often, especially in old Men, that the Patient, though the Fever be cured and the Body sufficiently purged, is notwithstanding very weak, and sometimes expectorats by Cough, and sometimes also hauks up a great quantity of clammy Phlegm, which Symptom does not only affrighten the Patient, but also imposes upon the Physician, especially if he be unwary, and induces him to believe, that this will make way for a Consumption, though I have observed that this is not so very dangerous. In this case I order the Patient to drink Old Malago, or Muskadine with a Toast, which [Page 489](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/468:5.6?vid=65404) takes off this Symptom in the space of a few days, as I have often Experienced. If the fermentation proceed well, there will be a perfect despumation of the morbifick Matter within the time aforesaid; but if cooling Remedies or Glisters have been given too late, the Fever will continue much longer, especially in very ancient Men, ill manag'd by the Physician. I have been sometimes called to such after they have laboured under a Fever forty days or more, and have tryed all things to induce despumation of the Blood; but it was so much weakened, partly by old Age, and partly by Glisters and cooling Medicines, that I could not attain my end, either by Cordials, or any other corroborating Medicines, but either their Fever stood its ground, or if otherwise it seemed to cease, the Patient's strength was very low, and in a manner gone. But other Remedies being unsuccessfully used, I have been often forced to take this course, and indeed with very good Success, viz. I have applied the brisk heat of young People to the Sick; neither is there any reason why any one should much wonder, that the Patient is so mightily strengthned and weak Nature relieved by this method, though it be unusual, as that it can deliver it self from the relicks of the Matter to be eliminated; seeing it is easie to conceive a transfusion of a great quantity of vigorous Esluvia from the sound and strong Body into the withered one of the Sick. Nor have I ever found, that the repeated application of hot Cloaths could at all do that which the now mention'd method has perform'd, where both the heat applied is more agreeable to the human Body, and gentle, moist, equal and lasting: And though this way of emitting balsamick Spirits into the Body of the Patient may seem absurd, yet it has been used by others with happy success. Nor truly am I ashamed to mention this Remedy, though perhaps some impertinent Men, superstitiously contemning all things Vulgar, may ridicule me for it; for I think the health and good of my Neighbour is very much to be preferred before their vain Opinions. [Page 490](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/469:5.6?vid=65404)He that prudently and with due consideration hath observed he method hitherto deliver'd, will free the Patient, if not from all, yet at least from most of these Symptoms, which are either wont to accompany this Fever, or to come after it. But forasmuch as such accidents often happen, either because the Sick neglected to call the Phisician in time, or by reason of the unskilfulness or carelesness of the Physician, I think it not amiss to treat briefly of their particular Cure, but will confine my self to those Symptoms that require a different Cure proper to themselves. And to begin with a Phrensie; if the Sick either upon the account of taking hot Medicines unseasonably, or by being naturally of too hot a Constitution, becomes Light-headed; or which is next to it, if he does not sleep at all; if he looks and talks fiercely; if he rakes Medicines and common drink greedily, and as it were snatches it, and lastly has a suppression of Urine; in this case I say, I bleed more freely than before, and use Glisters and cooling Medicines oftener, especially in the Spring. And though this Symptom does not appear in young People, and in those whose Blood is brisk, they admit of these Remedies without much hazard, and by the use of such Remedies I endeavour to keep up the Patient till the Disease has lasted a while, and then it is not difficult to free him at once of the Symptom and the Disease too; and this may be done by giving some Narcotick Medicine in a large Dose; for though when the Fever is at the height, those things that are of a narcotick quality, do no good nor answer the Physician's end; yet being given seasonably at the declination of the Disease, are very beneficial. But if the use of a Narcotick be deferred till the 14th. day, it will do the better. The Narcoticks which I am wont to use, are either London Laudanum, from one Grain, to one Grain and an half, or the following. Take of Cowslip-flowers, one handful, boil them in a sufficient quantity of black Cherry-water, mix half an ounce of Diacodium and half a spoonful of the juice of Lemons, with three ounces of the strained Liquor. Or, [Page 491](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/470:5.6?vid=65404)Take of black Cherry-water, one ounce and an half, epidemick Water, two drachms, liquid Laudanum, sixteen drops, syrup of Gillyflowers, one drachm; mingle them. I will only add this, which I think worth observation, to wit, That if this symptom will grant a Truce so long, and the Fever continues a long space, so that the Patient may be safely purged before the taking of the Anodyne, it will prove more effectual; wherefore, I used to order two scruples of the Pill Coch. Major dissolved in Bettony-water ten or twelve hours before the taking of the Narcotick; nor is there any danger from the Tumult which that hot Pill would otherwise occasion; for the vertue of the following Narcotick will appease these Commotions, and establish most gentle and sweet Peace. But if the Watchings continue after the Fever is gone off, all the other symptoms being likewise ceased, I have observed that a Rag dipt in Rose-water, and applied cold to the forepart of the Head and Temples is more beneficial than any Narcotick whatever. It often happens that the Sick is vexed with a Cough through the whole course of the Disease; it is first dry, because the Matter being yet thin frustrates the expulsive Faculty, but it soon grows thick, and is difficulty expectorated, because by degrees it is baked by the febrile heat; and hence it comes to pass, that the Patient is discouraged by fear of choaking, because he wants Strength to cough off this viscid Matter. In this case, I rarely use any other Medicine than Oil of sweet Almonds fresh drawn, unless it happens (and sometimes it is so) that the Patient has wholly an aversion to Oil, and then we must use the common Pectorals: But I think Oil of Almonds, if the Patient can bear it, is to be preferred before other Pectorals for this Reason chiefly, for that is necessary, they are given in a larger quantity, if we would do any thing to the purpose, and by this means we overcharge the Stomach, which was too weak before and inclined to be nauseous; and sometimes also, we are hindred upon the same account, so [Page 492](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/471:5.6?vid=65404) that we cannot mind those things which are to be dispatched at the same time. Nor can I understand nor learn by experience, why we should abstain from the use of this Oil (which we have now mentioned) in Fevers, because it is inflammable, and therefore to be feared lest it should increase the Fever; for suppose it naturally hot, yet certainly its heat is not so great, but that the advantage of it on another account may compensate for it; for it is manifestly more pectoral than other things, and opens and lubricates the Passages, and promotes Expectoration, by which especially if it happens to be large, the Blood is both freed from a troublesome Humour now conveniently evacuated, and also somewhat cooled; and, therefore, I am not much concerned, when I perceive this Symptom: But the Oil must be given frequently, a little at a time. Sometimes the Hickops happen, but most commonly to old Men, after large Evacuations, either by Loosness, or especially by Vomiting. In this case a large dose of Diascordium, viz. two drachms, has done the business, when I could do no good with the seeds of Dill, and other things that are cried up as Specificks. If in the course of this Disease a Loosness arise, which uses to happen when a Vomit was indicated at the beginning of the Disease, and was not taken: In this case a Vomit may be given at any time of the Disease, if the Strength does not contraindicate, tho' the inclination to Vomiting be long since past. But if a Loosness comes, tho' a Vomit has been given, I have found the following Glister more beneficial than any other Astringent whatever. Take of the bark of Pomgranats, half an ounce, of red Roses, two pugils; boil them in a sufficient quantity of Cows Milk, dissolve half an ounce of Diascordium in half a pound of the strained Liquor; mingle them, make a Glister. I would not advise that a Glister should be injected in a greater quantity; for tho' it may be naturally Astringent, yet there is danger lest it should weary the Intestines by its b, and so provoke the Flux more. [Page 493](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/472:5.6?vid=65404) CHAP. CXXI. Of the Scarlet Fever. THE Scarlet Fever, tho' it may happen at any time, yet most commonly it comes at the latter end of Summer, and seizes whole Families, especially Children: They shake and shiver at the beginning as in other Fevers, but they are not very sick; afterwards the Skin is covered with smali red Spots, but they are more, and much bigger and redder, and not so uniform, as in the Measles. These Spots continue two or three days; when they vanish and go off, Scales of Skin, like Bran, cover the whole Body. This Disease seems to me to be nothing else than a moderate Effervescence of the Blood occasioned by the foregoing Summer, or something else; and, therefore, I do nothing that the Blood may not be hindred in its despumation and injecting the peccant Matter through the pores of the Skin; only I order, That the Sick should abstain wholly from Flesh, and from all spirituous Liquors, and that he should not go out, nor contine himself perpetually to his Bed: But after all the Scales are fallen, and the Symptoms cease, I think it is proper to purge the Sick with some gentle Medicine agreeable to his Age and Strength; and by this simple and natural method, this name of a Disease, for it is scarce any thing else, is easily removed without trouble or danger; whereas, on the contrary, if we are over officious, by confining the sick to his Bed continually, and by giving Cordials and other Medicines unnecessarly, the Disease is increased, and the Patient killed secundum artem. [Page 494](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/473:5.6?vid=65404) CHAP. CXXII. Of Childrens Fevers. THE first Indication in curing Childrens Fevers, is, to prepare well the acid, that it may be the easier ejected: But this preparation must not be endeavoured by Sudorificks, properly so called, that is, such as heat the Body, which are by no means to be used for Infants or Children; but such things as absorbe the acid, and gently restrain the Ebullition, are to be used; the chief of these are Crab's Eyes and Claws, Oister-shells, Cuttle-bone, Egg-shells, Coral, Chalk, Coralline, Pearl, Mother of Pearl, both the Bezoar stones, Hartshorn burnt, burnt Ivory, the bone of a Stag's heart, shavings of Hartshorn, Bole-armenick, sealed Earth, Blood-stone, and the like; and among Compounds, compound Powder of Crab's Claws, the Goa-stone, and Confection of Hyacinth. Being called to an Infant of a year old troubled with a Fever or the Gripes, as they frequently are, I used to relieve them with the following Prescriptions, Take of the compound Powder of Crab's Claws, and of Pearl prepared, each one drachm; mingle them, make a Powder to be divided into six equal parts. Or, Take of Oriental Bezoar, prepared Pearl, and Crab's Eyes prepared, each half a drachm, of the species of the confection of Hyacinth, one scruple; make a Powder to be divided as before. Or, Take of the simple Powder of Crab's Claws, one drachm, of Crab's Eyes prepared, two scruples, of Cochinel, six grains; mix them, make a fine Powder to be divided into six Papers; let one be taken as soon as [Page 495](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/474:5.6?vid=65404) may be, and another two hours after, and afterwards let one be taken every fourth hour for the first two days, unless the Child be asleep: But let the Powders be taken in a spoonful of the following Julep, and give a spoonful presently after. Take of the Aqua lactis alexiteria, four ounces, of black Cherry-water, two ounces, of compound Peony and epidemick Water, each two drachms, of pearled Sugar, half an ounce; mingle them, make a Julep. Or, Take of Pennyroyal-water and Aqua lactis alexiteria, each three ounces, of syrup of Gillyflowers, 6 drachms, mingle them Or, Take of sweet Almonds blanched, number ten; beat them in a marble Mortar, and pour upon them gently half a pint of Barley-water, or of Aqua lactis alexiteria; strain it, and add six drachms of small Cinnamon-water, half an ounce of white Sugar; mingle them, make a Julep. Sometimes I am wont to use, other things being omitted, a Julep that hath much Pearl in it, but I order that the Glass should be well shook, before it be poured out. Take of black Cherry-water, four ounces, of all the Citron, two ounces, of Aqua mirabilis and prepared Pearls, each two drachms, of white Sugar, half an ounce; mingle them, make a Pearl-julep; give three spoonfuls at a time. But if the Child be troubled with the Cough, give half a spoonful of some pectoral Mixture or Linctus, and let him take less of the Powders above-prescribed. Take of the Powder of Coralline and simple Crab's-claws, each one drachm and an half, of the syrups of Maiden-hair and Marshmallows, each one ounce, of balsam of Tolu, half an ounce, of red Poppy-water, half an ounce; mingle them, [Page 496](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/475:5.6?vid=65404)Bole Armenick is often properly mixed with such things to good purpose, it powerfully stops Catarrhs flowing upon the Lungs; the juice of Pennyroyal heated and sweetned with Sugarcandy, is also better than most other Remedies; Oil of sweet Almonds is also very good, if Children can take it; so is Brimstone, and the Flowers of it. The foresaid Powders are to be repeated, seldom or often, according to the degree of the Symptoms; but it is here to be noted, that the Gripes, Restlessness and the Watchings of Children are as easily appeased by testaceous Powders, as pains and watchings by Narcoticks in grown People. The third day, unless the small Pox, Measles or a Scarlet Fever appear, I order a Child of one year old to be purged in the following manner. Take of syrup of Succory with Rhubarb, two drachms, of choice Rhubarb powdered, fifteen grains or a scruple, of the Aqua lactis alexiteria, one drachm, of small Cinnamon-water, thirty drops, mingle them. Or, Take of syrup of Buckthorn, one drachm and an half or two drachms, of the Powder called Diasenna, eight grains; mingle them. Take of the Earl of Warwick's Powder, which is also called Pulvis Cornachinus, described in the last Edition of the London Dispensatory, six grains; let it be taken in a spoonful of black Cherry-water, sweetned with a little Sugar. Take of sweet Almonds blanched, number three; beat them in a marble Mortar, and pour upon them gently an ounce or an ounce and an half of Barley-water, or any other simple Water; in the strained Liquor, dissolve three drachms, or half an ounce of the best Manna; mingle them, make a purging Emulsion. Take of Lenitive Electuary, two or three drachms, and dissolve it in an ounce of the Aqua lactis alexiteria. [Page 497](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/476:5.6?vid=65404)Sometimes I order this or the like Plaister to be applied to the region of the Navel, especially, if they are troubled with Worms. Take of Succotrine Aloes, one drachm, of the Powder of the leaves of Savin, of the tops of the lesser Centaury, and of the flowers of Camomil, each one scruple, with a sufficient quantity of Venice-turpentine; make a Plaister, let the margin of it be spread with the Plaister of Cummin, to make it stick the better; and sometimes it may be convenient to add to the other Ingredients, a scruple of Coloquintida. There is no purging Medicine more proper for Children and more innocent than Rhubarb; it gently and safely evacuates the Matter occasioning their Fever, and it gently purges off the Humors that burden the Stomach and whole Body, and it strengthens; wherefore, it is very proper for Infants, Children, big-bellied Women, old Men, and such as have been weakened by Diseases. After the Purge hath done working, some Powder like the former must be given in the Evening, and afterwards must be repeated three or four times in a day at fit times, for two days, and on the third day Purging must be used, and it must be dosed according to the operation of the former. These things being performed, the worst Symptoms most commonly cease, or at least are much abated. It is to be noted, That the first Purge we give to Children that have Fevers, must not be only Lenitive, but the Dose of it must be less than otherwise it ought to be; and the night before Purging, a gentle Glister, made of four ounces of Cow's Milk, Sugar and a little Salt, must be injected, if the Belly be bound. Moreover, to quicken the Purge, a scruple or two of Cream of Tartar may be dissolved in some spoonfuls of Water-grewel or the like, and so given. As to bleeding of Children, tho' it may be used, when the febrile Matter is cast upon the Lungs, or in a hooping Cough, yet it is plain that it is a Remedy not agreeable to their Nature. [Page 498](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/477:5.6?vid=65404)A Child about three years and an half old, was seized with a small Fever that was continual, and accompanied with Exacerbations that were very irregular; she complained of a great pain in the Head especially, and sometimes of the Belly, she nauseated all Meat, and was very sleepy, so that the Standers by thought she would have the small Pox; there was a twitching of the Nerves in sleep, and she had sometimes a dry Cough; I prescribed the following things. Take of the Aqua lactis alexiteria, six ounces, of Epidemick water, half an ounce, of prepared Pearl, one drachm, of the simple Powder of Crab's Claws, two drachms, of Cristaline Sugar, half an ounce; mingle them, make a Julep, whereof let her take three spoonfuls every fourth hour, shaking the Glass well before using it. Take of Succotrine Aloes, one drachm, of the tops of the lesser Centaury, of the leaves of Savin dried, each half a drachm, of Burgundy-pitch, one drachm, of Venice-Turpentine, a sufficient quantity, make a Plaister to be applied to the Navel. The next day she persisted in the use of the Julep, and a blistering Plaister was applied to the Neck; a Glister made of six ounces of Milk, with Sugar and Salt was injected, because the Belly was bound. Take of Aethiops mineralis, and of Mercurius dulcis, each six grains, of Marmalade of Quinces, two scruples; make a Bolus, to be taken at Bed-time. The next Morning, she took the following Cathartick syrup. Take of syrup of Buckthorn, two drachms, of the Earl of Warwick's Powder, six grains, of choice Rhubarb powdered, twelve grains, of Tincture of Saffron twenty drops, of black Cherry-water, one drachm; mingle them. [Page 499](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/478:5.6?vid=65404)Half a drachm of Cream of Tartar was given in a draught of Posset-drink to quicken the Purge; the same night, at Bed-time, four spoonfuls of the foresaid Julep were given. On the fourth and fifth days, the following mixture was given by spoonfuls. Take of Coraline, two drachms, of the leaves of Mint dried and powdered, one scruple, of the simple Powder of Crab's Claws, one drachm, of balsamick syrup and of the syrup of Marshmallows, each one ounce, of Orange-water, half an ounce; mingle them. The Evening preceding the sixth day, the Bolus before-prescribed was repeated, and the Morning following the purging Syrup, by the vertue whereof the Child vomited up a Worm a span long, and soon er\u00a6wards was well. CHAP. CXXIII. Of Agues. AS to the Cure, I have for many years taken notice how dangerous it is to endeavour to cure by Sudorificks, in Tertians and Quotidians, when they are new, and have not yet formed themselves, being at present like continual Fevers: For though it is well known, that upon Sweating, the restlesness and other symptoms presently vanish; yet if Sweat be forced too much, the Fever will be made continual, and the Life of the Sick will be endangered. Having therefore considered how ineffectual this method is, and the inconveniency of other Evacuations by Bleeding and Purging, I suppose the Peruvian Bark would do best; and I can truly affirm, notwithstanding the prejudice of the common People, and of a few Learned Men, I never perceived any injury by the use of it, nor can imagin [Page 500](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/479:5.6?vid=65404) any; only they that have used it a long while, sometimes fall into a scorbutick Rheumatism; but this seldom happens upon this occasion, and when it does, it is easily cured by the Remedies proposed for it in the Chapter of a Rheumatism. Being called to a Patient of a Quartan Ague, for instance, on a Monday, I do nothing if the Fit be to come that day, only I give the Sick hopes that he may be freed from the next Fit; and therefore on the two well days, namely, Tuesday and Wednesday, I give the Bark in the following manner. Take of the Peruvian Bark finely powdered, one ounce, with a sufficient quantity of Syrup of Gilliflowers, or of dried Roses, make ad Electuary to be divided into twelve parts, whereof let him take one every fourth hour, beginning presently after the Fit, drinking upon it a draught of some Wine. Or if he likes Pills better, Take of the Peruvian Bark finely powdered, one ounce, with a sufficient quantity of the Syrup of Gilliflowers, make Pills of a moderate bigness, whereof let him take six every fourth Hour. But an ounce of the Powder may be easier taken, and as successfully, mixed with a quart of Claret-wine, eight or nine spoonfuls of it being taken every fourth hour. On Friday when the Fit is feared, I give nothing, for most commonly no Fit comes; but lest the Disease should return, eight days exactly after the last Dose, I give the same quantity of Powder, viz. One Ounce divided into twelve parts, according to the method above-mentioned: But though most commonly by giving the Powder after this manner, the Disease is commonly Cured; yet to secure the Patient from a relapse, it is safe to repeat it three or four times, at the same intervals, especially when the Blood has been weakened by foregoing Evacuations, or by catching Cold. But though this remedy has no purging quality, yet by reason of the peculiar Constitution of some Bodies, it often happens, that the Sick is violently purged by it; in this case it is necessary to give Laudanum with the [Page 501](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/480:5.6?vid=65404) Powder; wherefore I give ten drops of Laudanum in Wine, after every other Dose, if the Loosness continues. I use the same method for Tertians and Quotidians; but Tertians and Quotidians often are almost continual, and there is only a remission of those days they should intermit, especially when the Sick has been confined to his Bed, and has used too hot a Regimen, and Medicines: In this case I give the Powder, as soon as I perceive any remission. But there are some that cannot bear the Bark, neither in the form of a Powder, nor of an Electuary, nor of Pills; for these I infuse in the cold two Ounces of the Bark grossly powdered in a quart of Rhenish-wine, and four Ounces of the Infusion standing some days, seem to contain the vertue of one Drachm of the Powder; and because it is neither unpleasant, nor oppresses the Stomach, it may be taken as often again as any other form of this Remedy. Sometimes it happens, that before this Disease is come to a regular Type, the Sick cannot retain the Bark in any form, by reason of continual Vomiting; in this case the Vomiting must be first stopp'd before the Bark can be given, to which end I order, that six or eight times in the space of two hours, one spoonful of the fresh juice of Limons be taken with a scruple of Salt of Wormwood; afterwards I give sixteen drops of liquid Laudanum in a spoonful of strong Cinamon-water, and soon after, if the Vomitting stop, the Jesuits Powder. For Infants, whose tender Age would scarce bear the taking of this remedy in another form, at least so much of it as would cure the Disease; I use to prescribe the following Julep, Take of Black-cherry-water, and of Rhenish-wine, each two ounces, of the Peruvian Bark finely powdered, three drachms, of the Syrup of Gilliflowers one ounce, mingle them, make a Julep; let one or two spoonfuls of it be taken according to the age, every fourth hour, till the Ague is cured. If there be a Loosness, you must give a drop or two of liquid Laudanum with every other Dose. [Page 502](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/481:5.6?vid=65404)As to the Diet, the Sick may eat any thing that agrees with his Stomach, only he must avoid cold Liquors and Summer Fruits, and let him use Wine moderately for his ordinary drink, by which alone I have cured some Patients that could not be cured with the Jesuits Powder. The Disease being taken off, the Sick must carefully avoid all evacuations, for the gentlest Purge, yea, only a Glister of Milk and Sugar, will be apt to cause a Relapse. CHAP. CXXIV. Of the various Forms and Shapes of intermitting Fevers. THese Fevers often resemble most other Diseases, and such as are most acute, yet they yield to the Peruvian Bark, and if the Bark is not given, they often become deadly. Sometimes they come with great Shivering and with violent Vomiting, a Loosness with Gripes, the Cholera Morbus, the Colick of the Stomach, a periodical Hemicrania, Apoplexy, fainting Rheumatism, general Convulsions, Phrensie, Peripnumonia, and the like. Mr. Amblar, dwelling at Mile-end, a Man of Fifty years of Age, that was lean and sickly, was often before subject upon slight occasions, to an obstinate Ague, accompanied with violent Symptoms, but in the Year, 1690, having taken a great Cold, he was suddenly taken with Shaking and Shivering, which was succeeded by an universal Chilness, during which, his Pulse could scarce be felt; he was also violently afflicted with Vomiting, a Loosness, and with a horrid oppression and Sickness: I visited him the next Morning, and found his Face plainly Hippocratick; his whole Body was cold as clay, and a Dew upon it, the Skin looked black, by reason of the congelation of the Blood, his strength [Page 503](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/482:5.6?vid=65404) was almost spent by the perpetual Sickness, and the evacuation of divers coloured Choler by Vomit, and stinking white Excrement by Stool, of the consistence of a Cream; all things shewed that Death was approaching, for the vital principal, or the animal Spirits, was so oppressed by the Venom, that there was no hope that they cou'd expand themselves: But to blunt the malignant acrimony of the Humours, I ordered that he should drink Chicken-broath plentifully, and that it should be injected through a Syringe into the Anus, I also ordered that the Stomach should be well fomented with Aromatick Bags made hot, and a very cordial Bolus, with as much Laudanum in it as the strength of the Patient would bear, was given with a draught of a Cordial, and alexipharmick Julep, every fourth hour. After the third or fourth Bolus, I perceived the Pulse was much stronger, and the blackness of the skin went off, and heat returned to the extream Parts, and the evacuations were something suppressed, the colliquative Sweat was diminished, and he was more quiet, he slept a little, and was not so sick after he waked. After this remission of the Symptoms, I endeavoured to remove the Venom, by giving the Jesuits Powder mixed with Laudanum in the form of a Draught, every fourth hour, knowing well that the Sick could not bear a second Fit; but before the third Dose of the Powder, the Fit returned again unexpectedly, accompanied with the former dreadful Symptoms, and the poor Man died within the space of twenty four Hours. I was called to one Mrs. Baker, an ancient Woman dwelling in Fleet-street, I found her oppressed with continual Sickness and Vomiting, and so she had been for four days: She presently vomited up all she took; she fainted often, her Pulse was quick and Weak; but her temper by reason of faintness and perpetual sickness, was moderate, and in some sort cold, her Urine looked in a manner well, she could not rest, and was almost delirious, but she complained only of Nauseousness and Vomiting. Having enquired carefully about every thing, I was told that this Woman had been sick six Weeks, that she was hot and cold by turns, the periods were uncertain, and that she was troubed with [Page 504](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/483:5.6?vid=65404) a Nauseousness and Vomiting frequently. After I had prescribed a Cordial, Bolus, and Julep, and Chicken-broath for her ordinary Drink, I ordered a Julep made of Salt of Worm-wood and juice of Limons, to be taken by Spoonfuls, to comfort her Stomach; afterward I ordered the Peruvian Bark should be given freely in the form of a Draught and of a Tincture, adding twice or thrice a day ten or twelve drops of liquid Laudanum, upon the account of the violence of the Vomiting, and in a days time the Sickness and Vomiting were lessened, and critical white Aphtha covered the whole Mouth, the Urine was very red, and other signs of the expansion of the Spirits, and of the feverish heat were present, and soon after a tertian Ague appeared in its proper form, the cold, heat and sweat succeeding one another alternately, and after two Fits, the Sick was cured by the Bark. CHAP. CXXV. Of Over-purging. AS Purging Medicines are sometimes necessary to loosen the Belly, and to evacuate ill Humours, so if the evacuation be immoderate, remedies must be used to stop it. To prevent it, consideration must be had of the Constitution and Strength of the Patient, and of the Nature and Dose of the Medicine, and while the Medicine is in operation, the Bowels and Blood and Spirits must be kept free from disturbance; wherefore at this time, gross and viscous Meats must be avoided, and much must not be eaten; Cold must be carefully avoided, and the mind must be clear and free; and after the operation of the Medicine, the Animal Spirits must be quieted, and the effervescence of the Blood, by giving an Anodyne. [Page 505](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/484:5.6?vid=65404)Take of Cowslip Flower-water two ounces, of Cinnamon-water hordeated, and of Diacodium, each half an ounce, of Pearls half a Scruple; make a Draught to be taken at Bed-time. But if Over-purging happens, the Patient must be presently put into a warm Bed, and you must apply to his Belly a Plaister of Venice-Treacle, and he must presently take inwardly a Bolus of Venice-Treacle and burnt Claret diluted with Mint-water, often by Spoonfuls, and if he be much grip'd, a Glister must be injected, made of Milk and Venice-Treacle. CHAP CXXVI. Of the French-Pox. THE French-pox came first from the West-Indies into Europe, in the Year, 1493. but a violent Gonorrhea shewed it self first about an hundred years since. It is propogated either by Generation, as when a Child is infected by the Parents, or by touching of some soft part, as when a Child is Infected by sucking a Diseased Nurse, or a Nurse by Suckling a Diseased Child, or by a Child's lying in Bed with such as are Infected; but it chiefly comes by impure Coition: But in sound and firm Constitutions impure Coition it self is not always sufficient to Infect; for sometimes many lying with an infected Woman, some are infected and others not, though they all equally deserve it. When a Man has to do with an impure Woman, either he has a heat or inflammation of the Penis with Excriation, or else he finds a heat in his Urine, and in a day, two or three, a Gonorrhea, or virulent Matter issuing from the Privy parts; sometimes Chancerous Ulcers, and when the Infection has been very violent, or the Inflammation [Page 506](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/485:5.6?vid=65404) neglected, a Gangren, and christaline Bladders arise, and the part Mortifies. Sometimes there is no Gonorrhea, but instead of it a Bubo arises in the Groin, which according to the degree of its Malignity, either proves easily curable, or else improves its Venom, and terminates in a phagedenous Ulcer with jagged Lips: There are also many venel Ulcers upon the Scrotum and Perineum. A Cancer is commonly attended with breaking out all over the Body like a Flea-biting, which terminates in various sorts of ulcerous Scabs, or Teters; or it may be Pustles arise in one or more places of the Body, as Head, Face Arms, Thighs, or Legs, or Ulcers in the Throat; then wandring pains begin towards night to affect the Shoulders, Arms, Legs, Head; and about this time appear in the Fundament, Warts, and other kind of Proturbances; also about this time Tumours arise in the Breast, Arms, Legs, and become Ulcers that are difficultly Cured. The pains growing more fixed, Nodes usually arise, and continually afflict them, but towards night grow more intolerable. Co-incident with several of these later degrees, are the noise in the Ears, Deafness, a Polypus, Opthalmia, the Fisula, Lacrimalis, fierce Catarrhs, Colick, Loosness and Consumption. Authors, upon the entrance of the Pox into Christendom, generally lookt upon it as not only Incurable, but also so highly infectious, that they ran away from it as much as the Jews did from the Leprosie; but later Ages and long experience, have made it less formidable; yet even to this day, it must needs be acknowledged difficult to Cure, in consideration of its malign and contagious quality, and the ungovernable disposition of the Patients. If the habit of the Body be strong, the cure of all the species of the Pox, whether they be Chancer, Pustles, Tetters, or eating Ulcers, or Ulcers in the Throat and Nose, are much easier cured, than the same are in many other chronick Diseases; but to root out the malignity is somewhat more difficult. [Page 507](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/486:5.6?vid=65404)If the Patient has been Clapt formerly, it will be more difficult to cure him the second time, and worse the third. If he has passed through long courses of Mercurial remedies ineffectually, his Cure will be difficult; and if he has been Salivated by unction, and relapsed, the Cure will be hard, by reason the Mercury is become familiar to him, and his Body is for the most part wasted. Nodes are more difficultly Cured than any of the Species above mentioned, and those whose Bones are corrupted are yet more difficult to cure; but if the habit of the Body be strong, and the Bowels sound, all the Species of this Disease are curable, if the Patient keep his Chamber, and submit to the rules of Physick and Diet; without which submission we can scarce cure the lesser Species. If the Bowels be unsound, or the Patient hectick, the Disease is incurable. As to the Cure, though Bleeding does not take off the Disease, yet in the very beginning of it we usually let Blood to quiet the fermentation of the humours, and to dispose them for evacuation, and prescribe a Glister before or after. If the Disease be of long continuance, and they have been let Blood some Months before, yet if we design Salivation, we do again let them Blood, if the Body be not too much wasted; for in some of those a Fever has happened in the time of raising the Salivation, and in Bodies of a Strong habit I have often seen them to break out in heat all over in the beginning of the Flux, so that then I have been necessitated to let them Blood when it was not so proper: But when there is a Bubo in the Groin, bleeding is not proper. But purging is more Universally necessary. Of Purges some are only lenitive, as Manna with Cream of and the like. Stronger Purges are these that follow. Take of the Leavs of Sena four ounces, of Gummy Turbith, Hermodactiles, each two ounces, of black Helebore, [Page 508](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/487:5.6?vid=65404) and of the pulp of Coloquintida, each six drachms, of the raspings of Guiacum, and Sassafras, each one ounce, of the Bark of Guiacum, of the Berriei of Juniper, of the outward Peel of Citrons, each half an ounce, of Cinnamon four Drachms; infuse them in equal parts of the Water of Baulm, Meadow sweet, and Carduus Benedictus for forty eight hours; then boyl them gently, and press them out strongly; in the strained Liquor dissolve too ounces and an half of Aloes, one ounoe of Diagrydium, evaporat them to the form of an extract for use. The Dose is half a Drachm or a Drachm. Take of Pil. Coch. min. A Scruple or half a Drachm, Mercurius Dulcis twenty Grains, make six Pills. Or Take of the extract above mentioned, of Gum Guiacum half a Scruple, of Mercurius Dulcis one Scruple, with Syrup of Buck-thorn make pills. Vomiting is of use in great disorders of the Stomach, when the foulness of that requires it, or when the Ulcers of some particular part require a sudden revulsion; so likewise when after the use of much Mercury outward or inward to Salivate, it does not rise kindly; they generally give strong Vomits if the party can bear them, viz. some preparations of Mercury, as Turbith, Mineral, and the like, or Crocus Metallorum: But in weaker constitutions, such as we may. The next thing which offers it self to our consideration is Salivation, without which few great Cures are done in this Disease. The methods of Salivating are diverse, but all by Mercury. Inwardly are prescribed various preparations of Mercury. When we design Salivation by Mercurius dulcis, we give it from twenty to twenty five grains, and sometimes to thirty, either in a spoonful of white Bread and Milk, or in conserve of red Roses, or the like; when we suspect it may worke by Stool, we prescribe it with Diascordium or Venice-Treacle at Bed time. If after taking of it four or five Days, their Chops do not swell, it may be reasonable to move it [Page 509](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/488:5.6?vid=65404) upward with a few grains of Turbith Mineral; according as their Chops swell, they will Salivat; if their Mouths be much ulcerated and swelled, the Salivation may last eighteen or twenty Dayes, during which they are to be kept warm, especially about their Head Neck and Chops, and to drink Chicken Broath or Posset Ale. Arcanum Corallinum, as it is generaly sold in the Shops, may be given from three grains to five, one Dose of it prescribed to a Woman Vomited her often, and Salivated twenty Days. Red Precipitat. is also Vomitive, but being well washed may be taken as safely as the white Precipitat. White Precipitat may be given proportionably as has been said of Mercurius dulcis. Turbith Mineral made of Vigo's Precipitat is best, twelve or 18 grains of it may be taken at a time, but that which is sold in the Shops is a rough Medicine, and must be given in a less quantity. There is also a way of raising a Salivation by suffumigation, the prescription whereof is as follows. Take of Cinnabar two ounces, of Crude Mercury one ounce, of Mastich, Frankincense, and Sandarach, each half an ounce, of Storax, Calamit, and Benzoin, each three drachms; make a fine powder of all, and with Turpentine make Troches, each weighing three drachms for use. But when the Pox is grown inveterate and affects the most solid parts with Node's, and the like, Salivation by unction must be used. Take of Lard two ounces, of Crude Mercury one ounce, mix them well. You must begin the unction in the following manner; the Patient must lodge in a close warm Chamber; if the Season be cold, the Windows must be covered with Blankets, and the Bed must be placed near the Fire, and encompassed with a Skreen, if the Chamber be large; you ought also to have a strong healthy Nurse, [Page 510](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/489:5.6?vid=65404) such as has been accustomed to the employment, that she may know how to wash the Patients Mouth, and direct and encourage him in such rules, as may be necessary in the time of Salivating. The most proper place for unction is a Stove, if it may be had, and the Patient can bear it; if he be weak, his Bed must be used, otherwise for want of a Stove, he must sit encompassed with a Screen by the Fire side, but not too near it. He must anoint himself, begining at the Feet, and then the Legs, Thighs, Hips, and so upwards taking in the Arms and Shoulders; the Belly must not be anointed, and indeed much of the trouble in weak Bodys may be spared; for in such the anointing of the Legs and Arms may be sufficient, the parts first anointed ought to be covered before you proceed to the next, as the Legs with Stockings, the Thighs with Trousses and the like; at last his Neck must be well wrapp'd with a Napkin tacked up to his Cap round about to his Ears and fastened before to keep his Chops warm; after this a warm Bed will be convenient and a Draught of Posset-drink to procure a breathing sweat; having reposed himself an hour or two he may rise and provide for his Dinner, which must consist of Meat of easie digestion Roast or Boyl'd, at his Dinner he may drink Beer or Ale with a Toast, the rest of the Day he must be confin'd to Posset-drink. You must use a third part of the Ointment at a time and continue dayly to use it for three Days following; when the Patient spits you must keep him to Posset-drink or Chicken-Broath, also a Cordial must be at Hand to prevent fainting, his Mouth must be syringed with Barly-Water and Liquorice and the like. New Milk held in his Mouth or Chicken-Broath will ease the pain and digest the Sloughs that rise; a rolled Clout ought to be placed between his Teeth to keep his Chops from closing; he must be rais'd high in the Bed if his weakness constrain him to it, and kept forward that the Rheum may run out of his Mouth and not down his Throat; but if he can rise he will spit the better and more plentifully. Salivation by unction commonly lasts twenty four or twenty five Days; sometimes to the thirtieth Day. [Page 511](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/490:5.6?vid=65404)In the hight of it our work is to keep up the strength, and if through Costiveness they Spit little, give them a Glister, that they may Spit better, and attend the washing their Mouths; but as the Sloughs begin to separate, which will be towards the declension of the Salivation, prescribe them a decoction of Sarsa or the like, to drink at least thrice a day; and before the Slough is quite cast off, purge them, and as they are able to eat Meat, put them into a drying diet, and sweat them, as shall be shewed in its proper place. It happens sometimes in anointing, that their Mouths are much Ulcerated, and their Breath smells strong, yet their Cheeks do not swell, nor do they Spit considerably; in which case, forbear the anointing, and consider the cause of it, and if the body be strong and plethorick, Vomit them with Turbith, or infusion of Crocus metallorum: But if they are weak or costive, administer a Glister; and if afterwards it rise not, dispose them to Sweat with draughts of warm Posset Ale, or bath them; for that way it will sometimes arise, when with the other it will not. But if they have faintness, palpitation of the Heart, shortness of Breath, Fever and the like, your best way will be to purge it off, with an infusion of Sena, and the like with the adition of Syrup of Roses solutive, or of Syrup of Buckthorn, and keep up their Spirits the while with Cordials, and good Broaths; if their Lungs be opprest, let them Blood, and prescribe Lohochs; but if there be also a suppression of Urine, or if they make but little and high coloured, purge them with Barnet or Epsom Water turned into Posset, and quicken it with some purging Syrup. If by these ways of purging the accidents remit, and the Salivation rises, it is well; but if it does not, yet there being a colliquation made, you may by well purging, strict diet, sweating and the like, obtain your end. While you are removing the abovesaid accidens, you must have a special regard to the Ulcers within their Mouths; for it is from the fixing of the Mercury, that those malign Ulcers are made, which the less sensible they are of them the more corrupt they are. Sometimes by raising the Salivation by unction, it passes downwards by Stool, in which case, we prescribe [Page 510](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/491:5.6?vid=65404) Venice-Treacle, Diascordium, Laudanum, Opiatum and the like, which being given at Night will not only strengthen their Bowels. but dispose them to rest, and incourage them to go on in the anointing, a Vomit of Turbith mineral. After the unction has been some while used, does frequently raise the Salivation, and after it is well raised, you may heighten, or continue it by the application of some of the following Plasters: But if after all your endeavours to raise the Salivation it does discharge it self by a loosness, with great evacuation, you are then to defend the Intestins from the acrimony of the humours, by Glister of Chicken-broath, lest the bloody Flux follows. Inwardly we prescribe large draughts of Chicken-Broath, a Decoction of burtnt Hearts-horn, and Milk-water boyled with a Stick of Cinnamon. After the Flux is stopt, you must consider the strength of the Patient, and if the Sick be very weak, you must not insist upon Fluxing, but proceed with Sudorificks, and the like, not doubting of success in the Cure; for such a loosness does for the most part contribute as much to the Cure, as if they had Salivated. There is yet another way of Fluxing, and that is by the application of Mercurial Plasters about the Arms Legs, and the like; they were first designed I suppose for the more tender, and delicate sort of People, who would not admit of the unction. Take of Diachylon with Orris one pound, of Red-Lead Plaster eight ounces, of Gum Carranna, and Tacamahaca, each four ounces, of Benzoin, Storax Calamit, and Ambar, each two ounces, of Liquid-storax, and of Peruvian Balsam, each a sufficient quantity; mingle them over the Fire, and when it is removed from the Fire, add eight ounces of Crude Mercury extinguished with Turpentine; make a Plaster. These being spread upon a Cloath thick, and applyed, you must then put them into a warm Bed, and with a draught of warm Posset-drink, sweat them dayly, and treat them, as has been said, in the Salivation by unction. [Page 511](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/492:5.6?vid=65404) If it arise not by the first Plasters, you must apply fresh once in four or five days; and if there be occasion you may hasten the Salivation by a few grains of Turbith Mineral. I have sometimes Salivated Persons by these Plasters, but for the most part, I use them to raise a Salivation, or continue it in such, where I began it with internals, and for that purpose they are of excellent use. The humours being evacuated by Salivation and purging, sweating will be necessary; they may sweat in Bed or out of it; the Bed is proper for the weaker sort, and there they may sweat with Bottles of hot water, or Bricks heated and placed about them; or they may sweat under a Frame; if they sweat with Bottles or Bricks, they must have many Cloaths, as Blankets and the like to cover them close, and the Bottles or Bricks may be wrapped in Napkins, and applyed according as you design to sweat, more particularly any one part; generally they are placed one each side near the Armpits, Hips, and at the Soles of the Feet. If you sweat with Bricks, let them be heated rather by boyling Water than Fire, lest in the Bed they burn the Patient. The way by a Frame is this, you are to fold a well aired Sheet four double, and lay it under the Patient; then his Shirt being stripped off, the Frame must be placed over him, and a Sheet over the Frame, and Blankets over that Sheet and both Sheet, and Blankets must be brought over the end of the Frame, and be tucked down close to the Neck; then a Pan of well burnt Charcoal, or Spirit of Wine must be put in the lower end of the Frame; this being done shut the Door, and take care that the heat be kept in. His Head ought also to be covered warm that it may sweat; if he took not his Sudorifick before, he must take it now, the Diet-drink must be warmed, and may be commodiously given with a Glass pipe; a couple of Servants must attend the Patient during his being in the Frame, the one of them must attend him with a warm Napkin to wipe the sweat off his Face, and to give him Cloaths to rub his Body with, which Cloaths ought to be thrust in and taken out at one side of the Frame; this Servant ought to have regard [Page 514](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/493:5.6?vid=65404) his Master, that upon the least complaint, he may give warning to his fellow to renew the Fire, or to take it out according as there should be occasion. The Fire being removed, and the Sheet next the Frame somewhat cool, one of the Servants must hold the Cloaths close to the Patients Neck and Shoulders, whilst the other draws the Frame away. Then shall they both tack the Blankets and Covering close to him, and give him another draught of his Diet-drink, and continue him in his sweat half an hour or more, if he can admit it; then gradually cool him, and pull away the wet folded Sheet from under him; then rub him with dry Cloaths and put on his Shirt; and if he be disposed to slumber an hour he may; otherwise he may rise and Dine at his pleasure. They commonly sweat three quarters of an hour in the Frame, and an hour in Bed, after the Frame is pulled away. The ways of sweating out of Bed are by Stove, Tub, Chair, or Cradle; the Stove is most easy in regard they may sit, stand, or walk up and down; but when they go out of them to Bed, there is danger of taking cold. Bathing is of great use in this Disease, whether it be new or old; in dry Bodies, where the Disease has been long confirmed, bathing is necessary to dispose them to Salivation; it is also proper after the Patient has past through the strict course of Salivation, purging and sweating; the Body being thereby dryed and wasted is hereby cooled, moistned, and restored to its natural temper. In order to bathing, we generally let blood and purge, if there be a Plethoria; but when the Body is wasted and dry, a Glister may serve: Before the Patient enters into the Bath he may drink a draught of Caudle or Broath, and in the Bath he may take a spoonful or two of Harts-horn-Gelly, or the like. The Vessel we bath in is a Tub wherein the Patient may sit up to the Neck, for want of such a Barrel may serve, the one end being beat out, and a stool placed in it to sit on; the bath Liquor is according to the occasion, and quality of the sick. Sometimes it is all Milk, other times Milk and Water, or only Water with a Bag [Page 515](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/494:5.6?vid=65404) of Wheaten Bran, which serves the Patient as a cushion and makes the water milky: They are sometimes Perfumed with Wood of Cassia, Rhodium, yellow Sanders, and the like. The Baths of Milk are apt to sowre, therefore ought to be renewed daily; the other will last longer sweet. In the time of Bathing, there ought to be plenty of hot and cold water, to continue the Bath of a moderate temper, neither too hot nor too cold; some Hoops should be fastened over the head of the Tub, whereon a Blanket or Sheet as a Canopy may be cast, in case the Air be cold; a Servant or two ought also to be attending in case of Fainting, lest he sink into the Water; therefore upon his complaint, raise him up, and casting a Sheet about him, put him into a warm Bed, where he may refresh himself, and at his pleasure rise and cloath himself, and Dine or Sup, as his appetite requires. Bathing may be used twice a day, but never upon a full Stomach. During the cure of this Disease, it will be requisite that the Patient keep his Chamber, and that it be made temperately warm; the taking of Physick and rambling abroad in the Cold being extreamly prejudicial to their Cure, and is frequently attended with a Loosness and noise in the Ears and Deafness There is also a special care to be taken concerning their Diet, that on those days they Purge, their Dinner be of good Nourishment, Boiled or Roasted. We also allow them good Broath, and Beer or Ale to raise their Strength, so as they may be able to bear the evacuation which is required. But in the time of their Sweating, we confine them to a very slender and drying Diet, only sufficient to support their Spirits. A Chop of a Neck of Mutton or two Ribs dry Roasted, was the old stint. I permit them to make choice of one sort of Meat, and keep them to it; which among the better sort is, Partridge, and that without Sawce, their Suppers may be Bisket, Raisins of the Sun, and a few blanched Almonds, and their Drink a Decoction of Sarsa, and the like; but in weak and extenuated Bodies, China Broath, or a mixture of Milk with their Diet-drink may be necessary. [Page 516](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/495:5.6?vid=65404)Exercise is of use in the beginning of this Disease, and may serve to rouse the native heat, and to thrust forth the malignity, and waste superfluities; but after the Disease is more confirmed, violent exercise is hurtful. Sleep is allowed in the day to refresh them, they being for the most part disturbed in the night by their Pains, which are therefore called Nocturnal. Venery ought to be avoided, and the Passions of the Mind. As to a Gonorrhea, the main of the Cure is performed by Purging; but because the Disease is accompanied with an Inflammation, and cured by Purging Medicines that are hot, cooling Diet must be ordered through the whole Course. Take of the mass of the Pill Coch. Major, three drachms, of Extract of Rudius, one drachm, of rosin of Julap, and Diagridium, each half a drachm, with a sufficient quantity of Opobalsamum; make six Pills of every drachm. The Sick must take four of them at four or five a Clock in the Morning, and sleep upon them for twelve or fourteen days or more, till the heat of Urine and the yellow colour of the Matter be much lessened; afterwards every other day for a Fortnight, and afterwards twice a Week, till the Humour quite stop, which will not be done till a long time, though it be commonly affirmed, that that Ichor that is seen especially in a Morning at the top of the Yard being pressed, proceeds only from a loosness of the parts, by reason of the long continuance of the running: Yet the Sick will find it otherwise, if he neglect Purging before it is quite gone: For upon any small occasion, as by immoderate Drinking, violent Exercise, or the like, the Gonorrhea will return. But if the Gonorrhea does not yield to such kind of Purging, it will be proper instead of Pills, especially if the Sick are difficultly Purged, to give betwixt whiles some more powerful Medicines, as is the following Purge. [Page 517](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/496:5.6?vid=65404)Take of Tamarinds half an ounce, of the leaves of Sena two drachms, of Rhubarb one drachm and an haf; boyl them in a sufficient quantity of Water, in three ounces of the strained Liquor; dissolve of Manna and syrup of Roses solutive, each one ounce, of syrup of Buckthorn and of Electuary of the juice of Roses, each two Drachms, mingle them; make a Potion. If the Cure proceed slowly, give eight Grains of Turbith Mineral, only twice or thrice, and at due distances, lest a Flux arises; and this Medicine is certainly the best for an obstinate running of the Rens. But sometimes the Sick has such an veron for Purging often repeated, that he cannot so much as see or smell the Medicine; and sometimes by a certain Idiosyncrasy, there is such an obstinate opposition to Purging, that a due quantity of the peccant Humour cannot be evacuated; and whilst we waste time to no purpose in endeavouring to purge the Sick, the Pox creeps on; when the case is so, we must use Glisters, and on those days the sick does not use them, we must give Catharticks by the Mouth: I proceed in the following manner, I give the foresaid Pills, or the like for two or three Mornings following, and afterwards I order the following, Glister to be injected in the Morning, and at five in the Afternoon daily, till all the Symptoms cease; only once or twice a Week I give a Purge, omitting on those days the Glister. Take of the Electuary of the juice of Roses, six drachms, of Venice Turpentine dissolved in the yolk of an Egg an ounce, mix them with a pint of Barly-water; to the strained liquor, add two ounces of Diacatholicon; mingle them, make a Glister. Every night at Bed-time I give twenty five drops of Opobalsamum, mixed with Sugar, or for want of it, Cyprus Turpentine, to the quantity of a hazel-Nut. I forbid salt Meats and other things of hard digestion, as Beef, Pork, Fish, Cheese, Roots and Herbs, and [Page 518](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/497:5.6?vid=65404) all Summer Fruits, and instead of them, I order Veal, Mutton, Chicken, Rabbets, and the like, and the Sick must eat but sparingly of these. He must forbear Wine and all strong and sharp Liquors; but he may drink Milk boyled with thrice the quantity of Water, and a small quantity of small Beer at Meals, and betwixt the Purging, he may drink of the following Emulsion frequently, to qualifie the heat of Urine, and the Inflammation. Take of the seeds of Melons and of Pompious, each half an ounce, of the seeds of white Poppies, two drachms, of blanched Almonds number eight, beat them together in a marble Mortar, pouring upon them gently, a pint and an half of Barly-water; to the strained Liquor add a sufficient quantity of Christaline Sugar, and make an Emulsion. When the Sick is of a very sanguine Constitution, and when the Disease is obstinate, after I have Purged him a Month or thereabout, I order eight or nine Ounces of Blood to be taken from the Arm. In this disease he that Cleanses well, Cures well, only Mineral waters must not be used. But it is to be noted, if the Glans be covered all over with the Prepuce, and if by reason of the Inflammation it be swelled hard and callous, so that it cannot be drawn back, it is in vain to attempt the cure of the Running, unless at the same time the Part affected be reduced to its natural State, the hardness and swelling being removed; therefore the following Medicines must be used Yake of the roots of Marshmallows and of Lillies, each one ounce and an half, of the leaves of Mallows, Mullein, Elder and Henbane, of the flowers of Camomile and Melilot, each one handful, of the seeds of Flax and Fenugreek, each half an ounce, boyl them in a sufficient quantity of Fountain-water, make a Fomentation, wherewith foment the part half an hour at a time, twice or thrice a day. [Page 519](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/498:5.6?vid=65404)After the fomentation I order that the part affected be anointed with the Oyl of Flax-seeds fresh drawn, and that a Plaster of the Mucilages be apply'd to the swell'd lips of the Prepuce; but if the Ulcer in the Lips of the Prepuce or on the Glans under it hinders it from being drawn back easily, besides the fomentation above mention'd I prescribe also the following Liniment. Take of Basilicon six drachms, of the Ointment of Tobacco two drachms, of red precipitat wash'd in Rose-water and well powder'd half a drachm; mingle them, make a liniment wherewith make Pledgets and apply them to the Chancres after the use of the fomentation. But when the Scrotum is the seat of the Disease, after the use of the fomentation, if the pain and swelling be not abated, apply a Cataplasm of Oxycrate and Bean-flower; also at the same time, I use inwardly Catharticks and cooling Medicines, and order the Diet above-mentioned, and bleed at any time of the Disease, if the swelling in the Scrotum be great, and if the pain be violent. If a swelling arises in the Groin, apply the follow-Plaster to suppurate it. Take of Galbanum and Ammoniacum, each two ounces, of Opopanax and Sagapenum, each one ounce, of Mustard-seed and Pellitory of Spain, each six drachms, of common Soap, two ounces, of Burgundine Pitch, four ounces, of Oil of Lillies, two ounces, of Wax a sufficient quantity; make a Plaister. For Ulcers in the Pallate and Tonsis. Take of all the Throatwort, three handfuls, of Holm, Self-heal and Male Speedwell, each one handful, of red Roses, one pugil, of red Sanders and the Wood of Juniper, each one ounce; make a Decoction in two quarts of Barly-water; boil it to the consumption of a third part; in the strain'd Liquor dissolve of syrup of dried Roses and Diamoron, each three ounces, of Hony, two ounces; make a Lotion. [Page 520](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/499:5.6?vid=65404)With this the Ulcer may be washed daily either by Syringing or Gargling: but if the Ulcers be behind or over the Palate, the best way to cleanse them will be to pass the Injection up into the Nostrils; but the Patient must keep his Mouth full of Water all the while to prevent Coughing. If the Ulcers are sordid, dress them with the Lac sublimate upon an armed Probe; if there be a Caries in the bone of the Palate, touch it with Aqua divina Fernelii; if the bone be corrupted through, 'twill be necessary to wear a plate. In Ulcers of the Nose, the matter usually mixing with the excrementitious humours dryes in the passage, and thereby prohibits the discharge, and increases the ulceration, and also the Caries, and therefore you are in the first place to supple and remove that, by casting up mucilaginous decoctions. Take of cleans'd Barly one ounce, of the roots of Marshmallows two ounces, of the Seeds of Quinces three Drachms, of Liquorish two drachms, boyl them in a quart of Fountain-water; to the strain'd Liquor add three ounces of Oyl of Almonds; let it be injected often in a day; the mucus being thus removed, inject the following Water. Take of Sarsaparilla sliced three ounces, infuse them twenty four hours in three pints of plantain-water, then boyl half away, towards the end add of the Leaves of Agrimony, Sage and the tops of Brambles each one handful, of red Roses and Balaustines each half an handful, quench Steel often in the strain'd Liquor, and add to it two drachms of Roch Alum, and make an Injection. This will cleanse the Ulcers, and in the mean while you may by Anti-venereals hasten the exfoliation of the Bones, and consolidation of the Ulcers. For the extirpation of Warts and the like Excrescencies magisterial water of Alum, lac Sublimati, Spirit of vitriol, and the caustick Stone, are proper; when these will not do the business, the Ligature and Knife and actual cautery [Page 521](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/500:5.6?vid=65404) will; but the growing of them again must be prevented by Anti-venereals. To cure the fluttering noise in the Ears arising in this Disease, Take of the bark of Guiacum one drachm, of the bark of Sassafras two drachms, of Castor four scruples, of the flowers of Lavender one drachm and an half, of Cloves half a drachm, of Spirit of Wine rectified, eight ounces; make an Infusion in a glass Vessel, twenty four hours upon hot Ashes; keep the strain'd Liquor for use. Put some of this daily into the Ears warm with Cotton. To ease Pains, Take of Lard four ounces, of Oil of Scorpions two ounces, of the Oils of Camomil, Rosemary and Sage, each half a drachm, of Petroleum and Spike Oil, each one drachm, of London Laudanum one Scruple more or less; mingle them and anoint the Part. If Nodes cause the Pain, apply the Plaister of Frogs, with four times the quantity of Quick-silver. [Page 522](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/501:5.6?vid=65404) CHAP. CXXVII. Of the Itch, and Spots and Pimples in the Face. OFten and constant eating of salt Fish or Flesh, and dryed in the Sun, also Drinks that are disagreeable and poysonous, do commonly cause cutaneous eruptions; also the Humour gathered in the cutaneous Glands, sometimes by meer Stagnation, becomes not only itchy, but oftentimes corruptive; wherefore, not only they that have been long kept in Prison, but also they that have liv'd a Sedentary Life and are used to Filth and Stinks, are subject to these Diseases. As to the cure of the Itch, there are two primary Indications; First, that the glandulous Humour be reduced to a due disposition. Secondly, that the pores of the Skin be freed from ichorus concretions. The preservative Indication respects these two things. First that the itchy Humour does not regurgitate upon the Blood and nervous Liquor. Secondly, that itchy Humour, if it be fallen upon the noble Parts, be eradicated. All these intentions of Healing, ought to be complicated, or at least provided for by turns, by external and internal Remedies. You must begin and end with Purging; and Bleeding, if nothing contra-indicates, must be used at the beginning. Alteratives must be also used, and Liniments and Baths, or Topicks of other kinds. I will set down some choice forms of Medicines of every kind, and first as to Purges; a Purge or a Vomit must be given at the beginning, and after bleeding, (if it be used) a purging Apozem, or Diet-Drink, must be taken for seven or eight days. [Page 523](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/502:5.6?vid=65404)Take of the Electuary, called Diacarthamum, three drachms, of the Species called Diaturbith with Rhubarb, one drachm, of Cream of Tartar and Salt of Wormwood, each half a Scruple, of the purging Syrup of Apples a sufficient quantity; make a Bolus. Take of Sulphur of Antimony grains seven, of Scammony sulphurated, grains eight, of Cream of Tartar, half a scruple; make a Powder. Take of the Roots of Polipody of the Oak, of sharp-pointed Dock prepared, each one ounce, of the leaves of Sena ten drachms, of Turbith, Agarick, and Dodder of Thyme, each one ounce, of the seeds of Carthamus half an ounce, of yellow Sanders two drachms, of the Seeds of Anise and Caraways, each two drachms, cut them and beat them, and digest them hot in two quarts of White-wine in a Vessel close stopped for twenty four hours; pour off the clear Liquor without pressing. The Dose is six ounces, either by themselves, or with a spoonful of the Syrup of Dodder of Thyme. Or, Take the fore-said Ingredients and boyl them in three quarts of Fountain-water till half is consumed, then add a pint of White-wine, strain it presently to be taken as before. Or, Take of the roots of Polypody of the Oak, of sharp-pointed Dock, each three ounces, of the best Sena four ounces, of Dodder of Thyme, Turbith, and Mechoacan, each two ounces, of yellow Sanders one ounce, of Coriander-seeds six drachms, prepare them according to Art, make a Bag for four Gallons of Ale, after five or six days Tap it, and take three quarters of a pint, more or less every morning for eight or ten days. For the ordinary drink provide four gallons of small Ale, and hang in a Bag in it the following Ingredients. [Page 524](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/503:5.6?vid=65404)Take of the tops of Tamarisk and Fumitory dryed, each four handfuls, of the roots of sharp-pointed Dock dryed six ounces, of the bark of Woody Night-shade two ounces, cut and beat them. As to altering Remedies, there is little need of others besides the altering drink above prescribed; only the Patient must observe a good course of Diet, he must forbear salt and peppered Meats, Shell-fish, and such as are Pickled; also Wine, Strong-waters and strong Beer. As to Ointments, the following is commonly used. Take of the powder or flower of Brimstone, half an ounce, of Butter that is not Salted, four ounces, of Ginger powdered half a drachm, make a Liniment. The following is neater, though not much more effectual. Take of Ointment of Roses four ounces, of Brimstone half an ounce, of the Oil of Tartar per deliquium, a sufficient quantity, make a Liniment; you may perfume it with a scruple of Oil of Rhodium. But after all, I have found by much Experience, that Quick-silver Girdles (though they are generally much disliked) are most effectual for curing the Itch, and as Safe as any other Medicine, if they are prepared in the following manner. Take of Quick-silver three quarters of an ounce, the White of one new laid Egg, beat them together in a woodden Dish with a Stick two hours, then spread it on a Girdle of new Flannel the breadth of three Fingers; you must spread it all by degrees and dry it in the Sun, or by a moderate Fire, and it must be worn a Month or six Weeks, being sewed strait round the Waste; the side whereon the Mercury is being turned [Page 525](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A53921.0001.001/504:5.6?vid=65404) to the Body. The Patient must be Purged once before the use of the Girdle, and once after the Itch is cured. And by this short and easie Method, I have cured whole Families infected with the Itch, and never perceived the least Injury, though I have used it frequently and several Years. The following Water is excellent for taking off Spots and Pimples from the Face, and the redness of it, and that blackness which looks like Gunpowder in the Face, especially about the Nose and Fore-head, which is sometimes the black heads of Worms. Take of Sublimate one ounce, put it into a tin Pot with three pints of Fountain-water, let them stand together twenty four hours, stir them now and then with a Stick, till all the Liquor looks black; filter it through Paper, and with a Feather or the like dipt in it, touch the Face gently once in a day or two.
