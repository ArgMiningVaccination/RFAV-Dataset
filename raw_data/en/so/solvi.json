He fully appreciated the importance of rigorous methodology and clarity in science, and for any developments in socialism. This is in sharp contrast with Chomsky's puerile mentalism, and the obscurantist charlantry of postmodernists and marxists; it saddens me to think of how the word 'socialism' has been tarnished by these anti-intellectuals...it really is for shame! On the other hand, Zellig Harris is one individual, who's work offers a chance for redemption, a chance to illuminate the real virtues of the left. Post modernism and marxism were conceived in sin: science is their redemption.

At any rate, the concept of the \"dialectic,\" while useful for ordinary language interactions, is too vague for serious science and philosophy; classical first-order logic is the model student in this regard. As for Jordan Peterson I have no interest in that quack. As for your concluding sentence...very good, been dying to hear that joke for some time now. @ [Oxyaena](/wiki/User:Oxyaena) - Do you not think that your intellectual positions, including your apparent socialism, could be bolstered by engagement with actual science and scientific philosophy as opposed to the wagging of wooden tongues. Ultimately Hume was right, when it comes to postmodernism or marxism, about committing such aberrations to the flame.

There is no discussion of him anywhere else in this wiki. Marxism and post modernism are certainly incoherent. That hasn't stopped special people from claiming to be both.

Or as the previous post even more harshly asserts, incoherent? I think much of his critique is still relevant but can't really respond to arguments which are not made - My point is that there are salvageable aspects of marxism: principles worth defending, areas that are rational and amenable to science, and areas that ought to be regimented using the tools of science i.e., first-order logic. I mentioned Harris as an example of someone who has pursued socialism whilst maintaining rigorous intellectual standards, that is, without falling in to the typical sloppy-reasoning of traditional marxism; Russell is another individual who fits this mould, even Popper recognised there were areas that were salvageable. Postmodernism, on the other hand, albeit a broad term, is a confused irrational mess, that has no right to be called philosophy. Clarity, simplicity, symmetry; the list goes on; these are all cannons of science and rationality.

Postmodernism is a philosophic branch, it doesn't matter if you like it or not. Finally, science is not clean. It's tentative models which expected to be eventually overturned. [Comrade GC](/wiki/User:GrammarCommie) [Ministry of Praise](/wiki/User_talk:GrammarCommie)18:34, 16 December 2020 (UTC) - @ [GrammarCommie](/wiki/User:GrammarCommie)- The only religious phrases that I have used are, as far as I can tell, are \"concieved in sin...\" and a comment I made on the naturalism talk page - \"trinity\"; now, I was using these phrases for their metaphorical poetry, and in a tongue and cheek manner. I am not a man of religion! I think you misunderstand my point as subjective, when instead, I'm making the case, albeit informally, that postmodernism is objectively incoherent. I am in complete agreement with your last two sentences. Science is messy, science is tentative. Science is always potentially revisable in the light of experience.

Fermi's Paradox[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=RationalWiki:Saloon_bar/Archive378&action=edit\u00a7ion=14)] It occurred to me that the number of planets in the universe is incomprehensibly vast, uncountable even. There are more planets than there are stars by multiple orders of magnitudes, and there are a *lot* of stars in the universe. It also occurred to me that life on earth started as soon as it possible could, and it only took a few hundred million years to do so. We now know of multiple places in our solar system alone that could potentially harbor life. Is the answer to Fermi's Paradox simply that we haven't looked hard enough or for long enough yet? \u2014 [Oxyaena](/wiki/User:Oxyaena) [Harass](/wiki/User_talk:Oxyaena) 16:38, 18 December 2020 (UTC) - I will never understand why people want to contact space aliens.

But we aren't a galactic empire yet, we've barely even been to other planets let alone expanded there.

They'd find unusual layers of rock, shaped in a manner that natural causes could not explain. They'd find a sudden disappearance of numerous species from the record, a massive extinction event. They'd find metals and minerals and oils missing from locations from where the science says they should have been at some point in time. They wouldn't be able to piece together exactly what happened, but they'd know something unusual happened involving our species. We don't see oil and other minerals \"missing\" from when the dinosaurs dug it all up, there is no evidence of mining or smelting or drilling from some progenitor species. We really are the first species on this planet with industry and science capable of producing spaceflight. The question is what prevents a planet from producing an interstellar species.

In another century, we should be able to send probes that will only take a couple of generations to arrive. But regardless, at some point, a species should be capable of reaching other stars, and once they do so, they should theoretically become immortal, and continue to spread until they visit and expand into every single star in the galaxy.

Usually I tell people that if this thing isn't touched for 4 weeks I will attempt to assassinate it, but after some brief googling I ran into some interesting news articles on this topic and decided that I will do some work on it. So this isn't my usual bitching about stubs, but more a case of me telling y'all that I'm gonna do some reading in the next few days, then insert some references into our article. Unless I fall asleep. Which I might, but I don't think so. If any of you have some good sources on this thing (be it the ones that promote these views or the ones that refute them), feel free to chip in.

Anyway, whilst searching for skeptical analysises of Roswell I stumbled across this and I just wanted to ask you guys if this has any veracity to it. \"Problem: there was no Mogul launch during the period of the Roswell debris finding. We have the records of Albert Crary, who was assistant to the head scientist on the Mogul project. There was supposed to be a launch, launch 4, but it was cancelled. Mogul also wasn't secret. Pictures of Mogul launches had been published in the press. It seems odd that the army officers at Roswell who were familiar with the highest level of secret US technology would not recognise the Mogul scraps. Mogul was the last in a line of sundry explanations for Roswell by the USAF. The stories changed several times over the decades and I'm not convinced I should believe them on this one. Other than that, I have no further comments, as I feel Roswell has become a big red herring.\" Source: [https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/2avipn/what_do_you_think_of_this_post_about_roswell_on/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/2avipn/what_do_you_think_of_this_post_about_roswell_on/) Everywhere I look I see that MOGUL was launched so am I crazy or what?-- [WMS](/wiki/User:WeakMindedSkeptic) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:WeakMindedSkeptic)) 15:09, 19 December 2020 (UTC) [Project Mogul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Mogul)was a nuclear sensor system used by the US military (The Soviets had their own version).

You may or may not be aware that the migraine medicine Topiramate is known to cause a grimacing aversion to carbonated beverages. I've become fascinated with this \"carbonation grimace\" as I call it, because I was born with carbonation grimace and I am completely immune to migraine headache pain (I enjoy alcohol hangovers). I've gotten myself a serious concern that this unrecognized symptom is an unrecognized link to glutamate hypofunction and/or deficiency, and I believe that there may be thousands of children who experience carbonation grimace who haven't been informed that they have glutamate hypofunction (which I'll tell you, is a big deal). There even seems to be a link to coprolalia. Think about your own kids, if you have any. Suppose they couldn't drink soda. You'd never have thought anything of it, but here I am to warn you. Doctors simply decline to comment on the matter - so I'll ask you, do I seem to have a rational basis for my concerns? [Henstepl](/w/index.php?title=User:Henstepl&action=edit&redlink=1) ( [talk](/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Henstepl&action=edit&redlink=1)) 19:13, 19 December 2020 (UTC) - In my not-a-physician opinion, nope. No rational basis. Why? On Google, the first sources I find about carbonation grimace are reddit and kiwi farms. Not authoritative! In the medical literature there is one case report published about carbonation dysgeusia (the fancy term) and that's with topimirate. One article about one patient. That's a profound lack of evidence. That doesn't mean that your concerns are false. It just means that there is ABSOLUTELY ZERO current evidence. So, no, no rational basis. [DerFluchtPlan](/wiki/User:DerFluchtPlan)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:DerFluchtPlan)) 20:30, 19 December 2020 (UTC) - Er, no. - The medical term for the phenomenon of altered taste perception is [dysgeusia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dysgeusia). I suspect that the OP's case, though, they might have gotten the (cough) \"bitter\" end of being a [supertaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/supertaster), which means that this person has an unusually sensitive palate for this particular food. [The Harvard Crimson](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2008/10/16/a-matter-of-taste-the-super/)has noted that some \"supertasters\" \"find the bubbles in carbonated drinks especially irritating.\" The cause of supertasters is unknown but appears to be genetic. For reference, [current science as far as I can tell](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3654389/)suggests that the enzyme [carbonic anhydrase 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carbonic_anhydrase_4)is responsible for the \"taste\" of carbonated beverages. Topiramate falls in a class of drugs known as [carbonic anhydrase inhibitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carbonic_anhydrase_inhibitor), so it's not surprising that this drug alters the taste of carbonated drinks in some people to be honest. Topiramate is not well reviewed for this phenomenon (one paper), but another carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, [acetazolamide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/acetazolamide)(used to treat glaucoma and altitude sickness, primarily) is well known enough for its carbonated drink changing properties that [there is a paper suggesting it be used to help soda-addicted people lose weight.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6208055/)I honestly don't think there is a connection between this phenomenon and glutamate, though.

I posted myself. I've cultivated a strong belief that there is some indicator in carbonation grimace, for which a formal term might have been \"oral hypoaesthesia\". I believe my friends when they say Topamax gives them carbonation grimace, and I believe those several individuals I've interviewed who were born with carbonation grimace linked to coprolalia. And we're all immune to migraines! - And when I say I believe these people, I'm not voting against some mass of literary evidence that has determined there to be no link to coprolalia or glutamate deficiency. I'm making my own field, I know, and from the confines of what I've seen, I am convinced. And I sincerely wish that I'd been told, when I was a kid, you have carbonation grimace - so you've got no glutamate. - Our carbonation grimaces are reversible through facial exercises. We can restore the ability to drink soda. That's not consistent with an enzyme - unless I'm reversing inhibition of every one in my mouth?

Yesterday I was what I would call deficient, to say the least. Now I'm capable of standing up again, and it's pretty great. - Topiramate will always have a place in my heart as the drug that made me notice there was a connection between carbonation grimace and glutamate hypofunction - because there is. It doesn't matter if the carbonic anhydrase inhibition explains the aversion that drug causes, I have spoken to several people with born carbonation grimace, and there is a link to coprolalia - one of the great misfortunes of my life, which I consider myself successful now in apologizing for. - I have written seven great theses for psychiatry, which you can find on the KiwiFarms thread I can't link here. One of them is the mechanism of action of Topiramate, which I feel stands uncontested though my personal link to the drug is diminished. - I'm so glad to interface with you when you point out why topiramate does what it does. I'm not delusional - and I do still believe the kids, through explanation rather than your mystery, will be saved.

Do Greek nationalists ignore that fact that population exchanges happen? Then again many of them using arguments similar to Nazi arguments. Macedonian should be the easiest Slavic language to learn. It has mostly dropped its case system (slavic languages have a lot of cases where the noun changes depending on its grammatical role in the sentence. Imagine if in English subjects took the suffix -sub and direct and indirect objects took -ob then sentences would look like this: Johnsub talked to Markob. Marsub is writing to his friendob. Theysub see Usob. It's even more complicated because adjectives and articles also take endings: Thesub bigsub mansub is talking to theob oldob ladyob. And its a billion times more complicated because those endings all change based on gender, number, grammatical function and several totally arbitrary paradigms plus there are tons of irregular ones. So not having to deal with all of that shit would considerably make it easier (that would cut down on at least 100 hours of learning...quite likely a lot more). Macedonian has lost most of those declensions and has remnants of two cases. The other big bonus is the lack of palatalised consonants. Most slavic langages have two ways of pronouncing almost all of the consonants. English only two examples being \"n\" and \"l\" though I don't know of any examples where substituting one with the other would create any confusion if you just pronounced an i afterwards but anyways. Palatalised n is like onion and palatalised l is something like million (many European languages distinguish them). But most slavic languages do this with most of the other consonants too, even at the end of words which can be fiendishly difficult to detect the difference (piet vs. pietj) until you gain a lot of experience. Macedonian has lost most of the palatalised consonants unlike its cousin Bulgarian which has retained some. So you also don't have to deal with that headache either which should reduce a lot of learning hours too. So if you really want to learn a relatively easy slavic language and don't care that it is one of the least spoken slavic languages offering the fewest opportunities to speak it with one of the smallest treasures of cinema or literature to enjoy, then Macedonian would be your language. Of course learning Bulgarian would be super easy if you know Macedonian and there would be a few more opportunities there. Why the interest? Do you have a crush on someone from Macedonia?

It even forms the past perfect just like English; it conjugates \"to have\" and adds a participle. And while Macedonian is analytical, it still is more inflected than English. Slavic languages are very synthetic on a whole. - I'm currently learning Kiche (a Mayan language), which has a similarly sized speaker base. While our target languages are different, I thought I'd still mention my studies because I'm curious as to how you've been able to find speakers. This is one of my main challenges in learning languages with small speaker bases. [Ourdearbenefactor](/w/index.php?title=User:Ourdearbenefactor&action=edit&redlink=1)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Ourdearbenefactor)) 22:18, 22 December 2020 (UTC) Macedonian, briefly: - Virtually identical to Bulgarian, to the degree that Macedonian delegations don't bother to bring their own interpreters to EU/CoE conferences and simply borrow the Bulgarian interpreter instead. The only real differences are the accent, which sounds slightly funny to Bulgarians in much the same way Austrians sound funny to Germans, and a few verbs that have inexplicably acquired an extra syllable or two. - Easy for English users to understand. You will start recognizing word boundaries and common roots fairly quickly. There are no weird pairs of phonemes you'd have trouble telling apart from each other. Spelling is completely and consistently phonetic. With the sole exception of wordfinal /, each letter always denotes the exact same sound in all contexts. - Somewhat hard for English users to fluently speak. Declension is trivial but conjugation is very involved by English standards. The lexical aspect and the subjunctive mood will be challenging and remain challenging for quite a few months.

Spammers call random numbers, those calls get rerouted to the NSA. The NSA stays on the line for half an hour, and charges $10/minute. - The way phones work, when you call someone else, your phone connects to Telecom A, who connects to Telecom B, who connects to C, then to the person you called. Telecom C doesn't know where the call originated from, only where Telecom B says it came from, which is how Spoofing works. But let's say the person you called is a phone-sex line that charges by the minute. They don't bill you, they bill Telecom C, who bills B, who bills A, who bills you. All along the way, the Telecoms collect fees from that bill, and IIRC, they pay those fees regardless of whether YOU pay in the end. - So the NSA sends the bill to Telecom A, who then passes it to B, then to C, then to the spammer. If the spammer doesn't pay, C has to eat the costs, so eventually C will disconnect the spammers or put in basic safeguards to prevent spammers from using their services. If C refuses to pay, then B refuses to connect any calls from C and that entire local service goes down, and spammers end up wrecking their own community, who then take matters into their own hands.

Much of the above honestly strikes me as a very Buddhist (in a \"life is an illusion\" sort of way) viewpoint of personality and self. It is religious oriented. (Edit: Nope, not Buddhist. One link is from a devotee of [Advaita Vedanta Hindu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta_Hindu), one is a devotee of [Mori religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_religion), and one is a psychologist who seems to [write self-help books with a mishmash of](https://www.amazon.com/Lotus-Effect-Suffering-Rediscovering-Essential/dp/1572249196)Buddhist and Hindu concepts, which usually I would describe as part of the [New Age](/wiki/New_Age)movement. There will probably be significant differences on the perception of self if one dives deeper into each individual belief.) At any rate, you either believe or you don't. The Buddhist type outlook does have the advantage of seeing personality as not a fixed data point, but something more fluid, which is probably true. The problem is more exact science is poorly understood. There is certainly a neurochemical side to personality (we know medications can alter such), but holistically science just doesn't have a great picture. Same with genetics, brain structure, etc. The more exact sciences know only bits and pieces here and there.

Those who already have pursued the kegerator route for having a bar inside your house with taps for beer are lucky in this regard -- all they need to do is take one of their Cornelius kegs, fill it with water, hook it up, and presto -- seltzer. (Correction: Club soda is apparently seltzer with a few additional mineral ingredients.) Add additional ingredients for other styles. (Kegerators involve a fair bit of upfront costs though, most people who have one have it for beer.) - A cheaper, more self contained alternative would be a \"soda siphon\" -- these are small fancy containers that use small CO2 chargers to carbonate the water. Seems like several brands exist here. - Another option would be a [carbonator cap.](https://www.morebeer.com/products/carbacap.html)This is a device the homebrew beer folks came up with to attach a CO2 tank to a 1 or 2 liter soda bottle. This involves more upfront costs than the soda siphon (you would need a CO2 tank, regulator, tubing+hose clamps, ball lock valve) but probably involves the least waste, as more things here are \"recycleable\" or not one time use. (Someone else on the Intertubes is [using this process to make seltzer](https://wonderlandkitchen.com/2013/05/diy-summer-seltzer-season/).) - Honestly, though, for a lot of soda recipes, the cheap alternative is to just get seltzer (provided there's no extra flavorings), which is indeed cheap enough and make your own stuff from there. For a simple soda like, say, lemon lime sodas like Sprite, 7-Up, etc. it's probably a fair bit better for you to mix seltzer with the juice of real lemons and limes, and a better tasting sugar, compared to commercial soda with all those unpronounceable preservatives. Fancier soda recipes (\"cola\" style for instance) exist on the Internet but I'm not sure how good they are. - I will say that I've had a few homemade \"old-timey\" style sodas (root beer, cream soda) and they usually are better than most commercial stuff.

During the holiday seasons, bands of young men, often rowdy, would \"wassail\" from home to home and demand handouts from the gentry, says Stephen Nissenbaum, author of \"The Battle for Christmas.\" Christmas involved an exchange between the social classes. But when Christmas was domesticated in the 1800s in the United States, the recipients of gift-giving shifted from the lower classes to children, given by versions of Santa Claus. It was then that a marketing opportunity was created, bringing us to the Santa-in-the-shopping-mall phenomenon that we recognize today.\" [[21]](https://www.csmonitor.com/World/2013/1221/Christmas-How-did-gift-giving-and-caroling-get-started#:~:text=Gift%2Dgiving%20has%20its%20roots,its%20roots%20in%20Christmas%20begging.) Getting upset that kids get a bunch of gifts during Christmas seems excessive. Atheists are highly distrusted in the world. And criticizing religious holidays isn't going to make the situation better. The Philippines is one of the most Catholic countries in the world and it is the \"Rome of Christmas\". Christmas is very important in the Philippines and no country celebrates Christmas more than the filipinos. Many Filipinos stay awake all night into Christmas day. I would also point out that Pope Francis has many Catholic critics and many critics in Christendom as a whole.

But its largely a problem that will solve itself. Retailers are the biggest promoters of the commercialization of Christmas. Retailers are losing market share to online sellers. More and more malls are closing up shop due to Covid-19 and online competition. Malls are seeing way less foot traffic. Children meeting mall Santas is becoming less and less common. American consumer spending is going to dry up in the coming years thanks to the spiraling national debt eventually causing an economic crisis.

Perhaps this would give more African American men an opportunity to stay in a family structure, as indeed there is evidence that a stable family structure helps reduce crime. It's hard to parent behind bars. But the current preferences of the American justice system, and particularly of conservatives who love to complain about African American single parent households (or, as seen in the [Breitbart](/wiki/Breitbart)commentary section, virtually everything else that has to do with Blacks), is punishment, punishment, and more punishment. Such an attitude enables the American police system that too often acts like they are \"the military\" (in a way that suggests many of them would flunk the [ASVAB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Services_Vocational_Aptitude_Battery), but never mind that), which in my opinion, is a strong root cause of the excessive police brutality in the United States. - (Anecdotally, my experience is that this punitive American justice system style is quite heavily supported by a lot of working class whites.

[Gol Sarnitt](/wiki/User:Gol_Sarnitt)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Gol_Sarnitt)) 03:52, 30 December 2020 (UTC) - It's definitely possible. It would depend on a lot of factors. If you moderated comments at all, then you'd make yourself more liable because you were specifically curating the content. It would also depend on where you were sued and what the courts wanted to do in those circumstances (i.e. would it be governed by circuit court precedent or not, and if not how would the courts rule?). Although long story short, if Section 230 were repealed, you'd potentially face a legal battle if this scenario were to happen, whereas in the current setup you'd be fine as long as you weren't the person defaming Joe Schmoe. You could, of course, get around this by either requiring comments to be approved before going up and just being extra cautious about what might be defamatory, or by just not allowing comments at all. - Of course, there are a lot of huge \"ifs\" hanging over this. If Section 230 were repealed entirely, with no sort of replacement. I'm highly skeptical, despite all of the talk from idiot politicians on both sides of the aisle, that Section 230 would actually end up being repealed wholesale. And the current iteration (the Senate's 2k check, 230 repeal, plus 2020 investigation) isn't going to be passed, so it's still safe for a good while longer.

Respectfully, Kwanzaa can certainly be fun, but above all it's a really meaningful holiday about celebrating Black people and Blackness. Here's the official Kwanzaa 2020 informative video about the holiday.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlf2P1Umcc8)(Futurama song) [CoryUsar](/wiki/User:CorruptUser)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:CorruptUser)) 20:10, 28 December 2020 (UTC) - The unfortunate side of Kwanzaa is that it was the creation of a 1960s black nationalist named [Maulana Karenga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maulana_Karenga). \"Your mileage might vary\" on how you view Kwanzaa depending on how you view his role or non-role in the UCLA 1969 Black Panther slayings, his later conviction for assaulting two women in 1971 (he maintains innocence), and whether this matters to how this impacts your viewpoint of the holiday. He was also rather hostile to Christianity in his early years, another \"your mileage may vary\" tidbit. Nothing wrong with recognizing harvest / solstice festivals around the world, of course. Unfortunately, my perception is that Kwanzaa is too tied to the 1960s black power movement and is fading in younger generations. In contrast, holidays like [Juneteenth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth)(which celebrate the exact emancipation date in Galveston, Texas, but this date seems to have spread as a national emancipation and Black culture celebration over the last several years) seem to be on the rise. [PanGalacticGargleBlaster](/wiki/User:PanGalacticGargleBlaster)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:PanGalacticGargleBlaster)) 03:20, 29 December 2020 (UTC) - I think most modern Black kids realize the whole Holiday is one elaborate joke. It's kind of like Jedi-ism. If someone wants to throw a Star Wars themed party, sure, why not. People are allowed to have fun, and if the theme is one of self-reflection and brings families together, it can actually be more meaningful than the commercial hell that Christmas currently is for most of us. If they insist that this Jedi religion is not some fantasy cooked up by George Lucas and associates, at that point they've crossed a line somewhere and are worthy of a sardonic Rationalwiki article. - Same with Kwanzaa. Want to have an Africa-themed party? Sure, why not, just make sure you aren't doing anything that native Africans have a right to find offensive, cultural appropriation and all that. Better yet, actually learn the history and actually base the thing on your actual African ancestors such as the Yoruba (the largest ethnic origin of African Americans), or perhaps the Mandingo (the second largest, though those poor women might disagree... ha!); virtually none of the victims of the Trans-Atlantic slave trade would've spoke Swahili. Want to pretend Kwanzaa isn't a synthetic modern-day party? Nope, at that point you are a twit and we shouldn't have to respect you.

Well, I guess the anesthesia being needled into the gum stung a bit, but it was over quickly. - Next few days were shitty though. The lover right wisdom tooth was growing horizontally and had to be removed in pieces. As a result my right cheek swell massively and even walking was painful as it caused the swollen cheek to bounce around. Also, couldn't really eat anything except ice cream for 2-3 days, which was fine. Wouldn't worry that much if you don't have similarly fucked up teeth. All the other wisdom teeth of mine were growing in the proper direction and I didn't get any major side effects from their removal. - Don't know much about the pain meds thing. But you probably shouldn't use at least any pain medication that thins blood, like aspirin or ibuprofen or something, 'cause the gums are going to bleed anyway. I don't think I used any pain medication afterwards, just the anesthetic for the operation itself.

We ought to put landmines in our chimneys. i first spotted my parents delivering presents to our stockings over 40 years ago. ask your friends. their friends, ask everyone. no will be able to tell santa delivered any presents. because hes not real wes told ourselves. norad says he does. there can only be one reason for no presents. no presents means we are on the naughty list. he knows when we've been good and when we've, and someones been so bad we are collectively punished for it. on the naughty list for perpituity. judgement from the god of the bible is water of a duck back - he was a judgy prick and sociopath. santa turning his back on us is truly damning though. i dont know what we we did, but we are clearly inhuman monsters. thats why norad can pick up santa. he knows what we did and hes leting us he know hes not angry, just very disappointed. im sorry santa, im so ashamed I work with some gun nuts[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=RationalWiki:Saloon_bar/Archive378&action=edit\u00a7ion=51)] Today, yes I worked Christmas Eve, I had a guy say that the election is still undecided because there is some kind of one state one vote law in the constitution. I asked him what it was, he said he didn't know exactly, he just knew the basics of it. Told him he should probably know more about it before he started considering it a possibility. He said it was just a possibility. So we looked it up, slow day, and he was talking about an electoral tie. Not a possibility in the current election. He wasn't too worried, because like right then-after he checked a delivery he was expecting, and his drum mag for his AK got delivered. Literally. And I say this next part very seriously. I've worked with this guy for years. He's not a mean or scary person. He's just curious to see how a drum mag works. When he announced his drum mag was delivered, I said \"Jesus, how many deer are you trying to fight off?\" and he said \"Who would hunt deer with an AK?\" So a little bit of jibbing, I was comfortable saying \"You probably need it because you couldn't hit the broad side of a school\" and he laughed because he knows I think guns are dumb and he knows I know he's not an active shooter situation. HOWEVER I also know he harbors fears that democrats will enable anarchy, and antifa mob rule is a present reality in his worldview. He grew up on NRA propaganda. A few years ago he wore a \"pink mist club\" t-shirt to work, had to send a guy he would respect over to tell him that was not cool, he would have to join the military and shoot somebody in the head if he wanted to wear that shirt, and he... Kinda? got it? His \"respect the fallen\" and \"thin blue line\" shirts, no big deal. What I'm saying is, this guy didn't learn this stuff from nowhere, he doesn't like this stuff because of nobody. He's a good guy, he's not like a \"Oh these blacks and immigrants and gays\" kinda guy, he really likes science and is a whip at math, but he's really heavily influenced by the people around him, even if he argues with literally everything he hears for no reason. Big love to the guy. Hope that drum mag quenches that thirst for rootin tootin trigger pullin never ending gun fun. But I'm not convinced it ends. A drum mag ends the same way as a regular mag, no more bullets. How is that more fun?

Monty Pythons UK films notably influenced US cinema after their debuts with more outlandish and intellectual comedy following in the US. Anime has influenced US animated films. And Hollywood films located in other countries incorporate local cinematic trends (Lost in Translation in Japan, Inglorious Bastards in France and Germany, Woody Allen's films in the UK, France and Spain). Almadovar, I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, Guillermo del Torro are just three examples of directors from the Spanish speaking world whose films have been influential, especially Pan's Labyrinth and Babel. It's more than extreme to say that international cinema's influence on US cinema doesn't include their own innovations. Currently in continental Europe there are tons of films that are played in one another's countries (Especially between French speaking countries, German speaking countries, Italy and Spain). Even at a cinema with the most popular titles available I see French and German films which likely will make next to nothing in the American market but are hits in continental Europe, have high budgets and don't give the slightest consideration to whether a US audience would like it.

Heck, one could argue that America's obsession with all things Japanese is really a form of cultural masturbation as well. A Japanese Christian immigrant to California more or less made up Samurai mythology in the book \"Bushido; The Way of the Samurai\" 1899. In English, based more on European \"knights in shining armor\" folklore than actual Japanese history, but Japan was in the middle of a wave of Hyper-Nationalism and a Japanese translation became a huge hit over there as well. Initially, Anime/Manga was an attempt to copy the works of American animators and comic book artists, but eventually became their own thing, but even then, regularly borrows heavily from American culture. - But back to the topic, really, gun nuts exist because someone is making having guns look cool. That's actually why I'm upset that the new Looney Toons no longer has Elmer Fudd using guns, when he is the perfect poster-child for the anti-gun crowd.

And you only have to look at John Woo's HK movies to see that guns being \"cool\" is an international phenomenon. On the other hand, I can't think of an international example of the American [vigilante film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vigilante_film)wave -- films like [Dirty Harry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_Harry)and [Death Wish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Wish_(1974_film))where a lone misfit takes the law into their own hands. (Probably there is something similar, but I don't know about it.) At any rate, in the US these type of films have been on and off popular since the 1970s, and reflect a certain American psyche that is paranoid of all authority and trusts no one except their guns, which in the real world is about as sad and comical as it sounds. Various paranoid style organizations over the last decades in America have correctly predicted hundreds of the last 0 American Civil War IIs.

It wasn't until 1977 that the NRA itself got hijacked by a bunch of gun nuts and became a hyper-partisan organization in a coup known as [The Revolt at Cincinnati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolt_at_Cincinnati). Prior to this, the NRA was about gun safety and training, not unabashed proliferation of firearms. One could argue this coup was orchestrated by the gun manufacturers themselves, but, conspiracy theories. - Bear in mind that in the late 70s, just about all the major American cities were basically hellholes of crime and drugs. [NYC saw its murder rate double in this time](http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/nycrime.htm), and while it's one of the safest cities now, it wasn't then. Many cities were and are worse; Baltimore, for instance, currently has Venezuelan levels of murder. No, seriously, that's not an exaggeration, both Venezuela and Baltimore have around the same (official) murder rate. And DC at one point was far worse than that. - With the spike in crime, and the police unable to cope, the narrative among the public was that whole shtick of \"when every second counts, the police are minutes away\". The only defense the people had was to arm themselves, and this was the perfect time for the NRA to come in and promote the whole \"self defense\" shtick.

[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=RationalWiki:Saloon_bar/Archive378&action=edit\u00a7ion=52)] Hey everybody. So if ur not as much of a druggo as me, you might not spend all ur time reading Erowid, peychonautwiki and drug-related subreddits. However, I've noticed something p interesting in these places. Since doing actual studies on drugs and how they affect you can be outstandingly difficult, and there is therefore not as much legit evidence to go on when talking about the effects of drugs, I've seen a couple of approaches to figuring out these issues. One of them is to actually attempt to form a sort of \"ground up\" sceptical/naturalistic/etc approach, by analysing the experiences of various drug users and the scarce amount of evidence there actually is to try to come to a conclusion. An interesting example of this is the realisation that lithium and psychedelics do not mix well. From my knowledge, there have only been one or two case studies about this and none that analyse why this might occur \u2014 however, every bit of anecdotal evidence confirms this happens, plus those one or two case studies. And like, I know the plural of \"anecdotes\" is not \"data\" or whatever, but I can say that I have seen someone combine these things and it was exactly like all the other experiences said (psychosis, anxiety, seizures, etc). However, there's also a lot of broscience or I guess \"folk science\" because of this sort of thing. For example, there's a lot of myths about how drugs work or about whether something can or can't get you high which have no real evidence to back them up, but hey! I bunch of other druggos say it so it must be right??? And idk, I think this shit is fascinating, seeing a large group of people trying (and often failing) to understand the experiences of something that \"real science\" rarely touches. Does anyone have any thoughts on this? Also another interesting thing to check out is the \"subjective effect index\", bc that's a pretty fascinating example of an attempt to analyse experiential/anecdotal evidence in a more sceptical and naturalistic way. Idk lol I'm neither a sociologist nor a scientist (yet) [ASELA](/wiki/User:Asela) [](/wiki/User_talk:Asela) 09:58, 27 December 2020 (UTC) - (Also I wanna b clear that I'm not saying any of this stuff is as good as actual studies and evidence, nor am I saying that \"anecdata\" is actually legit or that doing drugs makes u an expert. I'm just trying to think about how this stuff might relate back to the scientific method like, philosophically or whatever, and I'm not claiming to be some kind of smart person. Please do not b mean even if u disagree, bc this is a very bad time for me and I cannot handle it right now thanks) [ASELA](/wiki/User:Asela) [](/wiki/User_talk:Asela) 10:04, 27 December 2020 (UTC) - While \"folk medicine\" has a lot of bullshit, sometimes folk science can point to clues for paths for legitimate medicine. There is an entire discipline called [ethnobotany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnobotany)and/or ethnopharmacology that is devoted to drug discovery using clues provided by traditional \"folk medicine\" plants, and might use \"folk wisdom\" at times to provide clues. Unfortunately for the psychonauts, medical science is more interested in medicines that heal, and subsequently pays little attention to recreational pursuits. - Legal recreational pursuits, of course, have large industries that can funnel R&D into scientific analysis, particularly if there is a lot of consumers with money fueling it. The rise of IPA as a popular beer style has corresponded with a massive explosion in scientific research on hops with better flavor characteristics in the last couple decades, for instance. As the (closely related to hops, actually) recreational cannabis plant becomes a legal industry, I expect more scientific discipline in this field (although things like cross breeding and some degree of chemical analysis already are pursued even now, the fact that recreational cannabis is an increasingly legal industry, combined with the legitimate medical possibilities the cannabis plant may have, means means that no one is going to bat an eye that a [Journal of Cannabis Research](https://jcannabisresearch.biomedcentral.com/)exists these days). - Unfortunately, recreational psychedelics range in legality (with a few exceptions) from grey to illegal. Just from the little peaks you sometimes see (such as [Vice's interview with the inventor of methoxetamine almost a decade ago](https://www.vice.com/en/article/ppzgk9/interview-with-ketamine-chemist-704-v18n2)), I do think that the fields stuck in these grey areas -- \"research chemicals\", nootropics, performance enhancing drugs -- are often backed by legitimate biochemists (some of which have actual altruistic motives on occasion, and some of which are just going for the cash grab). However, you aren't going to see the fruits of their efforts in fully peer reviewed journals. I'm guessing that some information is shared around between those \"in the field\", and that for all I know the \"folk wisdom\" of the Bluelights of the world may sometimes inform their work. However, not being an underground chemist, I can't say for sure. [PanGalacticGargleBlaster](/wiki/User:PanGalacticGargleBlaster)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:PanGalacticGargleBlaster)) 18:44, 27 December 2020 (UTC) - This is gonna trip some triggers, but [Big Think Psychadellics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5T0LmbWROKY)actually has some things to say about which parts of the brain seem to relax during a psychedelic trip, and Sam Harris talks about taking MDMA. I think it would be stupid to not explore it. If you have something that's not toxic or lethal but can break up the ego, it would be cool in a psychiatric approach. I've had two trips where I was like \"Holy shit, I'm OBVIOUSLY either a time traveler or I've skipped dimensions\" and after the trips were like, completely done, and my brain was working, I've been like \"What the fuck was that about?\" - It tracks with what I've experienced, but I never did the microdose approach, nor did I have the security to do it constantly. My first experience was with LSD after my friends were kinda burnt out on it and all the nonsense they had created. They were finally done with it and I was finally done sitting them, I felt a little entitled to try it. My best friend at the time, who had really had a couple bad trips told me \"fine, if you want to do it, you have to go the whole way\" so I ate 6 weak tabs, and hung out with everyone and it was pretty normal, except for the hallucinations. But everyone I was hanging out with at the time knew how to handle somebody tripping, and I was so dedicated to not having a wild trip that it was just... Normal. The next day I went to work cutting lawns and felt, best I can describe it, fizzy brain more than fuzzy brain. I tripped alone after that and it was nuts, at the peak I had to just lay down and go to sleep. People don't believe me when I say that, but every time I've tripped since that first time, at the peak I have to lay down, close my eyes, and time dilates. I don't trip casually, my first time I think was an attempt at casual, and it wasn't what I was looking for. After a couple successful really intentional psilocybin trips, I had time to try and casually trip, like two years ago and it was bad. I was suddenly horrified my roommate, who wouldn't have given a shit, would come home and see the me that was just trippin. I got stuck on the bathroom floor with my eyes closed hallucinating I was in hell for somewhere between 30 minutes and a lifetime. I eventually broke out and just laid in bed and watched Adventure Time. The last time I tripped, which may be the last time I ever trip, was in the middle of July 2019. I cleaned my apartment from top to bottom, made sure I would have my place to myself, nobody was gonna call on me the next day, planned some activities (including VR games,) stayed up late and ate 3 gel tabs right before I fell asleep. Everything that happened the next day was quiet, calm, fresh, and interesting, but most importantly safe from social anxiety. I'm not interested in tripping outside of those parameters. I refuse to trip outside of those parameters. - I've never tried MDMA. Similar to what Sam Harris says in the video, I have watched people I have known for years act so incongruously with their personalities, opinions, behaviors that I immediately wrote it off as the dumb drug. I tried cocaine once, hated it. I don't smoke marijuana anymore because it sets off my anxiety. I drink a lot a lot. But I've learned, with the use of a breathalyzer, that I actually like to have, at the very least about 10 hours of 0.00 BAC a day. I don't have a reckless abandon bone in my body (I have to gin myself up to it), I couldn't imagine taking ecstasy at a party. But I'm friends with a lot of people who did that every night. And I'll say, some of them were way more interesting than the drinkers and teetotalers I've met. But yeah, they needed breaks, I like big trips but I like it when it's a really strange/unique experience. Nice place to visit, wouldn't want to live there, you know? Anecdotes are valid as personal experience in my book, just difficult to sit through.

I don't have a reckless abandon bone in my body (I have to gin myself up to it), I couldn't imagine taking ecstasy at a party. But I'm friends with a lot of people who did that every night. And I'll say, some of them were way more interesting than the drinkers and teetotalers I've met. But yeah, they needed breaks, I like big trips but I like it when it's a really strange/unique experience. Nice place to visit, wouldn't want to live there, you know? Anecdotes are valid as personal experience in my book, just difficult to sit through. - It tracks with what I've experienced, but I never did the microdose approach, nor did I have the security to do it constantly. My first experience was with LSD after my friends were kinda burnt out on it and all the nonsense they had created. They were finally done with it and I was finally done sitting them, I felt a little entitled to try it. My best friend at the time, who had really had a couple bad trips told me \"fine, if you want to do it, you have to go the whole way\" so I ate 6 weak tabs, and hung out with everyone and it was pretty normal, except for the hallucinations. But everyone I was hanging out with at the time knew how to handle somebody tripping, and I was so dedicated to not having a wild trip that it was just... Normal. The next day I went to work cutting lawns and felt, best I can describe it, fizzy brain more than fuzzy brain. I tripped alone after that and it was nuts, at the peak I had to just lay down and go to sleep. People don't believe me when I say that, but every time I've tripped since that first time, at the peak I have to lay down, close my eyes, and time dilates. I don't trip casually, my first time I think was an attempt at casual, and it wasn't what I was looking for. After a couple successful really intentional psilocybin trips, I had time to try and casually trip, like two years ago and it was bad. I was suddenly horrified my roommate, who wouldn't have given a shit, would come home and see the me that was just trippin. I got stuck on the bathroom floor with my eyes closed hallucinating I was in hell for somewhere between 30 minutes and a lifetime. I eventually broke out and just laid in bed and watched Adventure Time. The last time I tripped, which may be the last time I ever trip, was in the middle of July 2019. I cleaned my apartment from top to bottom, made sure I would have my place to myself, nobody was gonna call on me the next day, planned some activities (including VR games,) stayed up late and ate 3 gel tabs right before I fell asleep. Everything that happened the next day was quiet, calm, fresh, and interesting, but most importantly safe from social anxiety. I'm not interested in tripping outside of those parameters. I refuse to trip outside of those parameters. - This is gonna trip some triggers, but - While \"folk medicine\" has a lot of bullshit, sometimes folk science can point to clues for paths for legitimate medicine.

It's just a dismissal, on the grounds that Gohmert and the fake electors didn't have standing. Which is built out of other precedent long before this case ever came forward. What it means practically is that the ECA is upheld and the VP's powers are limited by it to be nothing more than a glorified letter opener for the chambers as they count the votes, and that any disputes are to be settled by the chambers. If Pence tries anything funny, the chambers can essentially smack him down by the rules of the chambers and the ECA. If he refuses to open certificates, they can determine that he's not present and hand the letter opening to the next presiding officer. If he tries to only count the fake electors in the \"contested\" states, then members can challenge that ruling, at which point after the dust settles the official (i.e. Biden) electors will be put forward (unless for some reason Dems just completely screw the pooch).

EH, it's something to do. [Kencolt](/wiki/User:Kencolt)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Kencolt)) 01:06, 27 December 2020 (UTC) - Eh, NYE was always had the worst fun/cost ratio of any major holiday. There's a reason every show has a Halloween Special or Christmas Special, and often a Valentine's Day Special, but only a few have a NYE special.

U literally can't be sad if ur on a shitload of 2cb and MDMA [ASELA](/wiki/User:Asela) [](/wiki/User_talk:Asela) 09:33, 27 December 2020 (UTC) - the pressure to 'do' something on nye has always been a ball ache. dunno why exactly failure to attend a party of somekind on the night has such a social stigma, but with everywhere ticketed with few last minute options, its like a game of musical chairs and being left standing with nowhere to sit as deadline looms is quite stressful. - Yeah lmoa ive always had to go to huge parties to avoid being Sad As Fuck on NYE.

I had a flat in Bayswater (more than an hours walk from the eye) and I had to share my room with two other guys so we could afford it. It was basically 3 beds and our wardrobes. And collectively we paid \u00a3900 a month for the room...and that was 20 years ago. - That's fair. I've never cared too much about the social stigma side of it but anything that causes contemplation has to be heavily avoided for me or else I feel like absolute garbage, especially in the whole \"COVID, election, partner breaking up with me, getting addicted to meth\" year lmao. The second I think about myself, my life, my relationships, etc., I basically get swallowed by bad memories, pain, self-hate and whatnot, and a day that basically says \"yes this is a good time to look back over the past 365 days of experiences\"? Bad shit. Luckily a friend says they might zoom call me, but the fact that I'm excited about it means it's probably reasonable to expect it won't actually happen, what with how this shit has been tending to go for me haha - Holy shit sticks how can you afford a flat 5 minutes from the London Eye?

The whole trip they were pretty cold and annoyed at me. Which I mean, all of this stuff was mostly my fault ig but idfk. A couple of weeks after I had got home, they told me they wanted a break bc of school stuff; then, bc the whole break thing made me pretty sad, they fully broke up w me via a single text message while I was asleep. That same week, I moved out my parents house and also the lockdowns started in my country. Aaa god and now I have to get even more drunk on goon to not remember that stuff. Oof and whatnot and also sorry for dumping this all on the Feed anyWay that's my life [ASELA](/wiki/User:Asela) [](/wiki/User_talk:Asela) 02:02, 28 December 2020 (UTC) - (do not ask how exactly it was my fault bc I don't wanna talk about it rn and also I've kinda forgotten most of the relationship except for the ending bits, I mostly just remember that I was kind of a bad gf and you'll have to take my word for that) [ASELA](/wiki/User:Asela) [](/wiki/User_talk:Asela) 02:07, 28 December 2020 (UTC) - Anyway this time last year, I was at my ex's house in the US while they were sick and I had just found out they were also dating their ex/roommate at the same time (which they said they had already told me but I sure don't remember that, and also I thought that our agreement was to ASK first if we could date someone else instead of just announcing. especially since they had insisted they wanted to stay mono with me for ages).

But anyway. I might actually have some LGBT fest thing, depending on if I have the energy and can find out info about it. If I do not, then there's still a chance of me zooming my friend. And if that doesn't happen? I saw my absolute best friend in person yester... idk some days (2?) which was nice, AND I have just enough clonazepam to not freak out while also not too much to get addicted. So while I still don't think it's the best time, some things are improving, and the benzos currently makes my memory to weak/apathetic to like. Notice if anything is hopening otherwise.

I know I'm late, but I'm glad to hear that your celebration of the conclusion of the dumpster fire that was 2020 turned out somewhat better than you previously thought, if only slightly. --Goatspeed.
