To inform the development of a pan-coronavirus vaccine, we investigated the presence and specificity of cross-reactive antibodies against the spike (S) proteins of human coronaviruses (hCoV) after SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. We found an 11- to 123-fold increase in antibodies binding to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as well as a 2- to 4-fold difference in antibodies binding to seasonal hCoVs in COVID-19 convalescent sera compared to pre-pandemic healthy donors, with the S2 subdomain of the S protein being the main target for cross-reactivity. In addition, we detected cross-reactive antibodies to all hCoV S proteins after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in macaques and humans, with higher responses for hCoV more closely related to SARS-CoV-2. These findings support the feasibility of and provide guidance for development of a pan-coronavirus vaccine. Editor's evaluation To develop a pan-coronavirus vaccine, the authors investigated the presence and specificity of cross-reactive antibodies against the spike proteins of human coronaviruses after SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination and quantified cross-reactive antibodies. [https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.70330.sa0](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.70330.sa0) Introduction One and a half year after the emergence of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19), the pandemic is still a major global issue with unprecedented consequences on healthcare systems and economies. Following the rapid initiation of many COVID-19 vaccine studies, the first vaccines are already FDA/EMA approved and mass vaccination campaigns are rolled out to hopefully soon subdue this pandemic ( [Polack et al., al., 2021](#bib45); [Sadoff et al., 2021](#bib35)). However, these vaccines show reduced efficacy against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and vaccine breakthrough infections are frequently reported ( et al., 2021](#bib30); et al., 2021](#bib16)). To anticipate emerging variants, more broadly protective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are desirable. However, the ultimate goal should be a pan-coronavirus vaccine that would be able to induce broad immunity and protection against multiple coronaviruses, thereby preparing us for future outbreaks. New coronaviruses that infect humans (hCoVs) emerge frequently, and SARS-CoV-2 is the fifth to be discovered in less than two decades, bringing the total up to seven ( [Kahn and McIntosh, 2005](#bib20)). These include the seasonal betacoronaviruses and hCoV-HKU1 as well as alphacoronaviruses hCoV-NL63 and hCoV-229E, which usually cause mild respiratory symptoms and account for approximately 5-30% of common colds during the winter season ( [Zhu et al., 2020](#bib56); [Li et al., 2020](#bib25)). In contrast, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV are far more pathogenic and led to epidemics in 2003 and 2013-2015, respectively ( [da Costa et al., 2020](#bib11); [de Wit et al., 2016](#bib12)). The currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 is less pathogenic compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, resulting in mild flu-like symptoms in the majority of patients, while only a small group of patients develop (bilateral) pneumonia that can rapidly deteriorate in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome ( [Tabata et al., 2020](#bib42)). Despite the lower pathogenicity compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the high infection rate of SARS-CoV-2 results in large numbers of hospitalizations and deaths worldwide. The majority of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are based on the spike (S) glycoprotein, a homotrimeric glycoprotein that is present on the surface of all coronaviruses and is the main target of protective antibodies. The S protein plays a pivotal role in viral entry and consists of an S1 subdomain including the receptor-binding domain (RBD) et al., [Walls et al., 2020](#bib46)). The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is most closely related to the S protein of SARS-CoV (~75% amino acid sequence identity), shows less similarity to MERS-CoV S protein (~50% identity), and is more distinct from the S proteins of the seasonal hCoVs (~25-30% identity) ( [Lu et al., 2020](#bib28); [Barnes et al., 2020](#bib6)). Although this sequence identity is considered low from the perspective of eliciting cross-reactive antibodies by vaccination, several studies observed cross-reactivity of COVID-19 sera against other hCoVs al., 2021](#bib4); [Song et al., 2021](#bib41)). In addition, the isolation and engineering of broader hCoV monoclonal antibodies have been reported ( [Wec et [Rappazzo et al., 2021](#bib34); [Wang et al., 2020](#bib48)). In this study, we identify broad hCoV antibody responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. We identify the S2 subdomain as a prominent target for cross-reactive antibodies and demonstrate that cynomolgus macaques vaccinated with a SARS-CoV-2 S protein nanoparticle vaccine elicit detectable antibody responses to other hCoVs. These results will guide the development of a pan-coronavirus vaccine. Results Convalescent COVID-19 sera contain robust IgG responses to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein Sera from 50 PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, aged 22-75 years, who suffered from a range of COVID-19 disease severities were obtained 4-6 weeks after symptom onset ( [Supplementary file 1](/articles/70330/figures#supp1)). A custom Luminex assay was used IgG antibody levels to the prefusion-stabilized trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein in these convalescent compared to pre-pandemic healthy donor sera. Sera from convalescent COVID-19 patients showed 990-fold higher antibody levels to SARS-CoV-2 S protein compared to pre-pandemic healthy donor sera (median 3.8 log10 p<0.0001) ( 1a](#fig1)). This is in line with a positive serological response in all but one of the participants using the commercially available WANTAI SARS-CoV-2 subdividing the convalescent patients based on admission status, fourfold higher antibody levels were observed for hospitalized patients compared to nonhospitalized patients (median 4.1 log10 vs. 3.5 log10 MFI, p<0.0001). SARS-CoV-2 neutralization capacity was also significantly higher (fivefold) in hospitalized patients (3.6 log10 vs. 2.9 log10 MFI, p<0.0001), and antibody levels and neutralization capacity were strongly correlated in all patients (Spearman's r = 0.735, p<0.0001) ( 1b](#fig1)). An eightfold higher antibody response to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein was observed in the oldest age group of COVID-19 patients (age >60) compared to the youngest age group (age <35) (4.1 log10 vs. 3.2 log10 MFI, p<0.001), which is in line with age being a risk factor for severe COVID-19 ( [Figure 1a](#fig1); [Williamson et al., 2020](#bib51)). No difference in antibody levels was observed between sex (3.8 log10 vs. 3.9 log10 MFI, p=0.71). These findings were confirmed with a principal component analysis, which showed two distinct groups based on hospital admission status, and indicated age as an important contributing variable ( [Figure 1c](#fig1), [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1](/articles/70330/figures#fig1s1)). Overall, these results with previous studies ( [Ju et al., 2020](#bib19); with all hCoV S proteins Next, we measured IgG binding to the S proteins of other hCoVs: SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, hCoV-OC43, hCoV-HKU1, hCoV-229E, and hCoV-NL63. We found significantly higher levels of antibodies binding to all hCoV S proteins in convalescent COVID-19 sera compared to pre-pandemic healthy donor sera, with the largest difference for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV S protein (123- and 11-fold difference respectively, p<0.0001 for both proteins) ( [Figure 2a](#fig2)). For the circulating seasonal hCoVs, a two- to fourfold difference in median levels of antibodies binding to the S proteins specificity of the cross-reactive antibodies in convalescent COVID-19 sera, we performed a depletion soluble protein [Figure sera resulted in a 92% reduction of antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. The reduction of antibodies binding to the other hCoV S proteins was strongest for SARS-CoV (61% mean reduction) and MERS-CoV (25%). A more modest reduction of signal was observed for hCoV-OC43 (13% mean reduction) and hCoV-229E S protein (6%), and we observed no depletion of antibodies binding to hCoV-HKU1 (2%) and hCoV-NL63 (-2%). On the individual level, some patients showed up to 72, 70, and 34% reduction of antibodies binding to hCoV-OC43, hCoV-229E and hCoV-HKU1 S protein after depletion, respectively. No reduction in signal was observed for the control protein tetanus toxoid after SARS-CoV-2 S depletion ( [Figure binding hCoV S proteins in pre-pandemic healthy donor sera did not decrease after depletion ( [Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1c](/articles/70330/figures#fig2s1)). These depletion experiments corroborate the finding that convalescent COVID-19 sera contain cross-reactive antibodies able to recognize other hCoV S proteins. We observed the highest cross-reactivity for the more closely related hCoVs ( [Supplementary file 2](/articles/70330/figures#supp2)). Indeed, the level of cross-reactivity expressed as the reduction of binding antibodies after depletion by SARS-CoV-2 S protein was associated with the level of sequence identity (Spearman's r = 0.83, p=0.06) ( [Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2](/articles/70330/figures#fig2s2)). To further explore the possible functionality of these cross-reactive antibodies, we investigated the correlation between hCoV S protein binding antibodies and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers. In addition to the observed correlation between SARS-CoV-2 S protein antibody levels and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, we found a moderate correlation between SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and antibodies binding to SARS-CoV S protein (r = 0.545, p<0.0001), a weak correlation with antibodies that bind to MERS-CoV, hCoV-HKU1, and hCoV-229E S protein (r = 0.324, 0.308, 0.320, respectively, all p<0.05), and no correlation with antibodies binding to hCoV-OC43 and hCoV-NL63 S protein (r suggest cross-reactive antibodies form a minor component of the neutralizing antibodies induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also investigated if there was an association between cross-reactivity and disease severity with a principal component analysis. Antibodies binding to other hCoV S proteins did not contribute to the separation between patients based on admission status as clearly as was seen for SARS-CoV-2 S protein antibody levels, suggesting a limited impact of cross-reactive antibodies on disease severity ( [Figure antibodies preferentially target the subdomain To determine the main target on the SARS-CoV-2 S protein for cross-reactive antibodies, we performed a depletion experiment in which we compared the reduction of IgG binding to hCoV S proteins after depleting soluble monomeric S2 subdomain, a 48, 20, and 19% mean reduction of signal was observed for antibodies binding to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and hCoV-OC43 S protein, respectively, while no reduction was observed after S1 depletion ( [Figure 3](#fig3)). Absolute MFI values before and after depletion are shown in [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2a](/articles/70330/figures#fig3s2). For some individuals, depletion rates reached up to 83% for SARS-CoV, 75% for MERS-CoV, and 80% for hCoV-OC43 S protein while there were no individuals with substantial reduction of cross-reactive antibodies after S1 depletion. We did not observe significant depletion of antibodies binding to hCoV-HKU1 and hCoV-229E S proteins by S1 or S2 subdomains of SARS-CoV-2 at the group level. However, in some individuals the signal was reduced by up to 59% for hCoV-HKU1 and 71% for hCoV-229E S protein following depletion with the SARS-CoV-2 S2 subdomain, while such effects were not observed after S1 subdomain depletion. Changes in antibodies that bind to hCoV-NL63 S protein after depletion with SARS-CoV-2 S1 and S2 subdomains were comparable to those observed with the control protein tetanus toxoid and to the reduction in signal for hCoV S in healthy donors ( S2 sequence identity (r = 0.90, p=0.03) while there was no correlation for SARS-CoV-2 (r = 0.23, p=0.67) supplement 2](/articles/70330/figures#fig2s2)). These results indicate that S2-specific antibodies have a greater contribution to cross-reactivity than S1-specific antibodies, which is in accordance with the higher conservation of the S2 subdomain compared to the in macaques The observed cross-reactive antibody response following natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 does not reveal whether these might be de novo responses or the result of cross-boosted preexisting memory from previous hCoV infections. To investigate the ability of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination to induce de novo cross-reactive antibodies against hCoVs, we investigated the serum of six cynomolgus macaques that were vaccinated three times with prefusion-stabilized S protein coupled to I53-50 nanoparticles ( [Brouwer et al., 2021](#bib8)). The vaccination response was studied by comparing serum IgG binding to hCoV S proteins after three vaccinations (week 12) to the pre-immunization baseline (week 0). We observed that all macaques developed a detectable increase of antibodies that bind to all hCoV S proteins. Antibodies binding to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and hCoV-OC43 S proteins were increased compared to by 3313-, 168-, and 106-fold, respectively ( [Figure 4a](#fig4)). This cross-reactivity was already detectable 2 weeks after the first immunization ( [Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1a](/articles/70330/figures#fig4s1)). The induction of antibodies that bind to hCoV-HKU1 and hCoV-229E S proteins was relatively low with a 39- and 16-fold increase from baseline, respectively. Antibodies binding to hCoV-NL63 S protein showed only a sixfold increase from baseline ( [Figure 4a](#fig4)), and there was no increase observed toxoid ( [Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1b and c](/articles/70330/figures#fig4s1)). All comparisons were statistically significant except for the tetanus toxoid. Using the SARS-CoV-2 S protein depletion assay, an 88, 98, and 99% mean reduction of antibodies binding to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and hCoV-OC43 S protein, respectively, was observed ( [Figure 4b](#fig4)). In addition, depletion also resulted in a mean reduction of antibodies binding to proteins hCoV-229E S (92%), hCoV-HKU1 S (92%), and hCoV-NL63 S (75%). Virtually no depletion (3%) was observed for the control protein tetanus toxoid ( [Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2](/articles/70330/figures#fig4s2)). Together, these results demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is capable of inducing cross-reactive antibodies to both alpha and beta hCoVs SARS-CoV-2-na\u00efve individuals To confirm the ability of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination to induce cross-reactive antibodies also in a human setting, and to investigate the induction of these antibodies elicited by vaccination in a background of preexisting hCoV immunity, we measured IgG binding to hCoVs S proteins after vaccination in 45 SARS-CoV-2-na\u00efve individuals. Antibody levels 3 weeks after the first vaccination and 4 weeks after the second vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine were compared with their baseline results before vaccination ( [Figure 5](#fig5)). IgG binding to hCoV S proteins is already increased after the first vaccination, but the largest increase in binding was observed following the second vaccination for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and [Figure 5](#fig5)). This is in accordance with our previous results in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals and immunized macaques. The hCoV-229E (2.1-fold), and hCoV-NL63 (1.9-fold) was similar to the increase observed for the control protein tetanus toxoid (1.7-fold, p<0.0001) ( [Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1](/articles/70330/figures#fig5s1)). These our previous findings that most cross-reactivity following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is observed for the most closely related hCoVs. [see all](/articles/70330/figures#fig5) Discussion As mass vaccination campaigns take place around the globe, there is optimism that the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will be subdued. However, there will likely be future challenges with emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants as well as with entirely new hCoVs. A number of studies have shown that neutralizing antibodies induced by COVID-19 vaccines have substantially reduced activity against some SARS-CoV-2 variants ( [Voysey et al., 2021](#bib26); [Xie et al., 2021](#bib54)). Therefore, development of broader SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is needed, with a pan-coronavirus vaccine as the ultimate goal. In this study, we show that convalescent COVID-19 sera have higher levels of antibodies that bind to other hCoV S proteins compared to pre-pandemic healthy donors. We confirmed this cross-reactivity by showing that SARS-CoV-2 S protein could partially deplete antibodies binding to all hCoV S proteins except hCoV-NL63 in COVID-19 patient sera, while no effect of SARS-CoV-2 S protein depletion was observed in healthy donor sera. Additionally, we see that the elevation of hCoV S antibody levels and the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 S protein to deplete these antibodies is highest for hCoV S proteins that share most sequence homology with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Cross-reactive antibodies can be the result of de novo responses or due to cross-boosting of preexisting hCoV immunity. Others have shown cross-reactive antibodies resulting from boosting of preexisting immunity after natural infection in COVID-19 patients ( [Ng et al., 2020](#bib31); [Anderson et al., 2021](#bib1)). We further explored the possibility to induce de novo cross-reactive antibodies by vaccination in a cynomolgus macaque model. These macaques are unlikely to have encountered hCoVs, although infections of macaques have been described for the common cold hCoVs ( [Dijkman et al., 2009](#bib13)) and the animals were not tested for hCoV infection prior to entering the study. All SARS-CoV-2 S protein nanoparticle immunized macaques showed detectable antibodies binding to all hCoV S proteins, which could also be depleted with SARS-CoV-2 S protein. We suspect that the fact that not all sera reached a 100% depletion could be an indication of conformational differences between our hCoV S proteins, even though we confirmed that they form trimers ( [Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5](/articles/70330/figures#fig2s5)). Throughout this study, a tetanus toxoid protein was consistently included and confirmed the specificity for the increase of IgG binding to hCoV S proteins in COVID-19 patient sera and in SARS-CoV-2 immunized macaque sera. Interestingly, we did observe a significant increase in antibody levels to tetanus toxoid following vaccination in humans, indicating also aspecific immune activation by the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine, which has been observed by others as well ( [van Gils et al., 2021](#bib44)). These responses after immunization with a vaccine containing a similar prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 S protein as many current COVID-19 vaccines demonstrate that these narrow focused vaccines might already induce low levels of cross-reactive antibodies. However, the strength of the response should be an important consideration as low levels of antibodies to viral antigens and/or the presence of predominantly non-neutralizing antibodies could potentially lead to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection ( [Wan et al., 2020](#bib47)). Currently, ADE has not been reported widely for SARS-CoV-2 ( [Arvin et al., 2020](#bib3)) and for other hCoVs there is no consensus ( [Lee et al., 2020](#bib24)). In addition, it remains unclear in clinical studies if preexisting immunity against other hCoVs influences the severity of COVID-19 ( [Westerhuis et al., [Dugas et al., 2021](#bib1); [Sagar et al., 2021](#bib36)). In these 50 COVID-19 patients, we did not find evidence of a clear association between the presence of cross-reactive antibodies and COVID-19 disease severity. As we show that most of the cross-reactivity is targeting the S2 subdomain of the S protein, we propose that this subdomain should receive more attention in vaccine design. The influence of the pre- or postfusion conformation of S2 on this level of cross-reactivity remains unknown as only a postfusion S2 construct is currently available. In addition, we can only speculate about the functionality of these S2 targeting antibodies as no neutralization assays for other hCoVs are performed in this study. However, others have described protective neutralizing antibodies targeting the S2 subdomain ( [Huang et al., 2021](#bib18)). Furthermore, analogous to some influenza virus hemagglutinin stem antibodies ( [DiLillo et al., 2016](#bib14)), antibody effector functions might also contribute to protective immunity by S2 antibodies ( [Zohar and Alter, 2020](#bib57); [Shiakolas et al., 2020](#bib38)). Additional possibilities to improve breadth include the use of consensus or mosaic vaccine designs similar to what has been done in HIV-1 vaccine research ( [Sliepen et al., 2019](#bib40); [Corey and McElrath, 2010](#bib10); [Cohen et al., 2021](#bib9)). In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, only a few S2 subdomain mutations are reported in SARS-CoV-2 variants Therefore, a S2-based booster vaccine after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination could be used to amplify and broaden the immune response. The results from this study on the presence and specificity of cross-reactive antibodies to other hCoVs after SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination emphasize the feasibility of broad coronavirus vaccines and may guide future vaccine designs. Materials and methods Study population [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap70330?item=s4-1) Sera of 50 SARS-CoV-2-infected adults were collected 4-6 weeks after symptom onset through the cross-sectional COVID-19-specific antibodies (COSCA) study (NL 73281.018.20) as described previously ( [Brouwer et al., 2020](#bib7)). In short, all participants had at least one nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab positive for SARS-CoV-2 as determined by qRT-PCR (Roche LightCycler480, targeting the Envelope-gene 113 bp), and 49 of 50 participants were serological positive for SARS-CoV-2 (Wantai, WS-1096, total SARS-CoV-2 RBD targeting antibodies). Patient demographics and medical history were collected and used to score the maximum disease severity by using the WHO disease severity criteria of COVID-19 ( [https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/clinical-management-of-covid-19](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/clinical-management-of-covid-19), accessed on 16-10-2020). The COSCA study was conducted at the Amsterdam University Medical Centre, location AMC, the Netherlands, and approved by the local ethical committee (NL 73281.018.20). All individuals provided written informed consent before participating. Sera of 30 healthy donors were kindly provided by the Dutch Institute for Public Health and Environment (RIVM). Sera donated in 2019 were used to exclude possible exposure to SARS-CoV-2. No seasonal influence was observed when analyzing IgG binding to the seasonal coronaviruses of control sera obtained at different calendar months (data not shown). Pre- and post-vaccination sera of 45 SARS-CoV-2-na\u00efve participants were collected as part of the prospective serological surveillance cohort (S3-study) conducted in two tertiary medical centers in the Netherlands ( [Sikkens et al., 2021](#bib39)). The study was approved by the local ethical committee of both hospitals, and all participants gave written informed consent before participating (NL73478.029.20). In short, participants were included since the beginning of the pandemic in the Netherlands, March 2020, and asked to visit the hospital every 1-2 months to test for a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection by determining their serological response using the Wantai ELISA and to fill in a questionnaire about COVID-19-related symptoms and prior SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR results. Only participants without a history of a SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in this current study. In January 2021, these SARS-CoV-2-na\u00efve participants were vaccinated twice with the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine. Serum samples were obtained approximately 21 days after the first and 28 days after the second vaccination. Additional information about the study population and the SARS-CoV-2-specific response following vaccination is described by [Appelman et Cynomolgus macaques [Request a Klosterneuburg, Austria) diluted in PBS by intramuscular route at weeks 0, 4, and 10. Blood samples were taken at baseline and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 after vaccination. Additional information is described by [Brouwer et al., 2021](#bib8). Cell lines [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap70330?item=s4-3) HEK293F cells were sourced from Invitrogen, and HEK293T cells expressing the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 were provided by Paul Bieniasz of The Rockefeller University and verified by FACS. Cells have been tested for Mycoplasma contamination. Protein designs [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap70330?item=s4-4) A prefusion-stabilized S protein ectodomain of and SARS-CoV with a T4 trimerization domain and hexahistidine (His) tag were previously described ( [Brouwer et al., 2020](#bib7)). A prefusion-stabilized S protein ectodomains construct of hCoV-HKU1 was designed as described previously ( [Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016](#bib21)). Specifically, a gene encoding amino acids 1-1276, in which the furin cleavage site (amino acids 752-756) was replaced with a GGSGS sequence and amino acids at position 1067 and 1068 were mutated to prolines, was ordered and cloned into a pPPI4 plasmid containing a T4 trimerization domain followed by a hexahistidine tag. The same procedure was used to generate prefusion-stabilized S proteins of MERS-CoV, hCoV-229E, hCoV-NL63, and hCoV-OC43. For the prefusion-stabilized S protein ectodomain of hCoV-229E, a gene encoding amino acids 1-1082, with proline substitutions at positions 871 and 872, was ordered. The prefusion-stabilized S protein ectodomain construct of hCoV-NL63 consisted of amino acids 1-1263 and introduction of proline substitutions at positions 1052 and 1053. For MERS-CoV, a gene encoding amino acids 1-1214 with proline substitutions at positions 1060 and 1061 was obtained, and the furin cleavage site (amino acids 748-751) replaced with an ASVG sequence. The prefusion-stabilized S protein ectodomain construct of hCoV-OC43 was designed as described previously ( [Tortorici et al., 2019](#bib43)). Specifically, this construct consisted of amino acids 1-1263, which had the furin cleavage site replaced with a GGSGG sequence and for the protein designs. Protein expression and purification [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap70330?item=s4-5) The tetanus toxoid protein was acquired from Creative Biolabs.

All other proteins were produced in HEK293F cells (Invitrogen) maintained in FreeStyle medium (Life Technologies). Transfections were performed using polyethylenimine hydrochloride (PEI) MAX (Polysciences) at 1 mg/L and the expression plasmids at 312.5 \u00b5g/L in a 3:1 ratio in 50 mL OptiMEM (Gibco) per liter. Supernatants were harvested 7 days post transfection by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 30 min followed by filtration of the supernatant using 0.22 \u00b5M Steritop filter units (Merck Millipore). The His-tagged proteins were purified from the clarified affinity chromatography using NiNTA agarose beads (QIAGEN). Eluates were concentrated and buffer exchanged to PBS using 100 kDa molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) Vivaspin centrifugal concentrators. Further purification to remove aggregated and monomeric protein fractions was performed using size-exclusion chromatography on a Superose6 increase 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) using PBS as buffer. Trimeric S proteins were eluted at a volume of approximately 13 mL. Fractions containing trimeric protein were pooled and concentrated using 100 kDa MWCO Vivaspin centrifugal concentrators. The resulting protein concentrations were determined using a Nanodrop 2000 Spectrophotometer, and proteins were stored at -80\u00b0C until needed. Information regarding protein integrity was obtained from Native PAGE analysis, which showed all proteins consisted of staining kit (Invitrogen) and HMW-Native Protein Mixture (GE Healthcare) as a marker.

Other proteins were coupled equimolar to SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Luminex Magplex beads (Luminex) were washed with 100 mM monobasic sodium phosphate pH 6.2 and activated by addition of sulfo-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubated for 30 min on a rotator at room temperature. The activated beads were washed three times with 50 mM MES pH 5.0, and the proteins were diluted in 50 mM MES pH 5.0 and added to the beads. The beads and proteins were incubated for 3 hr on a rotator at room temperature. Afterward, the beads were washed with PBS and blocked with PBS containing 2% BSA, 3% fetal calf serum, and 0.02% Tween-20 at pH 7.0 for 30 min on a rotator at room temperature. Finally, the beads were washed and stored at 4\u00b0C in PBS containing 0.05% sodium azide and used within 6 months. Detection of the His-tag on each S protein-coupled bead was used to confirm the amount of protein on the beads. Luminex assays [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap70330?item=s4-7) Optimization experiments determined the optimal concentration for detection of hCoV S protein binding antibodies to be 1:10,000 dilution for COVID-19 patients, 1:50,000 for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 detection in cynomolgus macaques, and 1:500 for detection of binding antibodies to other hCoV S proteins in cynomolgus macaques. 50 \u00b5L of a working bead mixture containing 20 beads per \u00b5L of each region was incubated overnight with 50 \u00b5L of diluted serum. Plates were sealed and incubated on a plate shaker overnight at 4\u00b0C. The next day, plates were washed with TBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST) using a hand-held \u00b5L of goat-anti-human IgG-PE (Southern Biotech) and incubated on a plate shaker at room temperature for 2 hr. Afterward, the beads were washed with TBST and resuspended in 70 \u00b5L MAGPIX Drive Fluid (Luminex). The beads were agitated for a few minutes on a plate shaker at room temperature and then read-out was performed on a MAGPIX (Luminex). The resulting MFI values are the median of approximately 50 beads per well and were corrected by subtraction of MFI values from buffer and beads-only wells. A titration of serum of one convalescent COVID-19 patient as well as positive and negative controls was included on each plate to confirm assay performance. Assays were performed twice (technical replicates) with COVID-19 sera were diluted 1:10,000 with addition of 10 \u00b5g/mL soluble recombinant SARS-CoV-2 prefusion-stabilized S protein, confirmation S1 S2 subdomain controls). Immunized macaque sera were diluted 1:500 with addition of 30 SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Incubation was performed in uncoated 96-wells plates on a shaker at room temperature for 1 hr. Then, 50 \u00b5L of a working bead mixture containing 20 beads per \u00b5L of each region was added, and the plates were incubated 2 hr on a shaker at room temperature. After 2 hr, the above-described Luminex protocol was continued starting with the TBST goat-anti-human assay was performed as described previously ( [Brouwer et al., 2021](#bib8)). Briefly, HEK293T cells receptor ACE2 et al., 2020](#bib37)) were seeded in poly-L-lysine-coated 96-wells plates, and the next day triplicate serial dilutions of heat-inactivated serum samples were prepared, mixed with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, incubated for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C, and then added in a 1:1 ratio to the cells. After 48 hr, the cells were lysed, transferred to half-area 96-wells white microplates (Greiner Assay System (Promega) with a GloMax system (Turner BioSystems). Relative luminescence units were normalized to the units from cells infected with pseudovirus in the absence of serum. Neutralization titers (ID50) were the serum dilution at which infectivity was inhibited 50%. Statistical analysis [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap70330?item=s4-10) Luminex data were log transformed prior to any statistical analysis. p-Values below 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Mann-Whitney U tests for unpaired comparisons, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test for paired comparisons, Friedman test with Dunn's multiple comparisons test for paired comparisons with correction for multiple testing, and Spearman's correlations were performed in GraphPad Prism 8.3.0. An overview of all statistical tests, exact p-values, and 95% confidence Intervals is provided in [Supplementary file 3](/articles/70330/figures#supp3). Principal component analysis was performed in MATLAB 9.6 (R2019a). Data availability All relevant data is included in the paper and supplementary materials.

Decision letter after peer review: Thank you for submitting your article \"Cross-reactive antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination\" for consideration by eLife. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Sara Sawyer as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Andrew T McGuire (Reviewer #3). The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Essential revisions: In this study, Grobben et al. examines whether binding antibodies that cross-react with the spikes of diverse coronaviruses are elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The manuscript is well written, and the figures are laid out in an easy to interpret manner. This study will be of interest to those who are interested in developing pan coronavirus vaccines. However, the following issues should be addressed before acceptance: 1. What are the relative contributions to the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity in the sera upon depletion of S1 or S2 subdomains? It would be very interesting to assess whether there a reduction of serum neutralizing activity following S2 mAb depletion as would imply that the cross binding S2 antibodies might have neutralizing activity against diverse CoVs. 2. Do the authors have access to human post-vaccine sera? It would be interesting to compare the results of natural infection to vaccination. 3. Could any of the differences in cross reactive binding be due to differences in the stability of the various spike proteins? Presumably all of the spike-ectodomain designs will stabilize the proteins in the pre-fusion state, but it is not demonstrated that they are. Misfolding could lead to the destruction of relevant conformation-dependent cross reactive epitopes. 4. Related to the point 4 above, is the S2 used in the depletion studies in the pre-fusion or post-fusion conformation? Since the 2 conformations are quite different structurally, it's likely that they are antigenically distinct, and may therefore fail to deplete out relevant cross-reactive serum antibodies. If neither of the points (3 and 4) can be easily addressed experimentally these caveats should be pointed out in the discussion. 5. The authors suggest that the macaques are likely CoV na\u00efve, however the data suggest that this may not be true. If the animals are truly naive, then all of the cross-reactive antibodies should have been elicited by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and similarly depleted by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. For example, in Figure 4b all of the SARS-CoV-2 spike binding antibodies are depleted by the SARS-CoV-2 spike, but only about 70% of the SARS and OC43 binding antibodies were depleted. Do the authors have an alternative explanation for this? Reviewer #1: In this study, Grobben et al. evaluated the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibodies against the S proteins of a variety of coronaviruses. The results shown by the authors are important and should be published for the post-vaccination era. However, the cross-reactivity is mostly evaluated by only the binding affinity to the S proteins. The results shown by Grobben et al. are basically important and should be published for the post-vaccination era. However, the cross-reactivity is mostly evaluated by only the binding affinity to the S proteins. The authors should evaluate the neutralizing activity of these antibodies using live viruses and/or pseudoviruses. Using all coronaviruses might be difficult, but some (e.g., seasonal coronaviruses such as 229E and NL63) should be used. Evaluation of neutralizing activity would be important for the authors' conclusion. Evaluating the binding affinity to a variety of coronavirus S protein is very important and insightful. However, to consider its biological activity, neutralizing effect is much more important, because binding affinity and neutralizing affinity are not necessarily correlated. Reviewer #3: Here the authors were seeking to assess whether SARS-CoV-2 infection elicited antibodies that cross react with diverse human CoVs using a Luminex platform. The major conclusions are that cross-binding antibodies are elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection, and that there is a positive association between the magnitude of the response and the sequence similarity to SARS-CoV-2. As a result, most cross-reactive antibodies target the S2 region which is the most conserved among diverse CoVs. The study also shows that immunization with a SARS-CoV-2 spike derived nanoparticle vaccine similarly elicits cross reactive CoV antibodies in non-human primates. Overall, the data suggests that the S2 domain might be important for the development of pan CoV vaccines. The study is largely observational, and conclusions are supported by the data. The major limitation is that it is not clear what role the measured cross-reactive antibodies might play in protective immunity. If a function could be assigned to the cross-reactive antibodies ie neutralization or ADCC, then these findings might be more impactful for guiding the design of pan CoV vaccines. What are the relative contributions to the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity in the sera upon depletion of S1 or S2 subdomains? It would be very interesting to assess whether there a reduction of serum neutralizing activity following S2 mAb depletion as would imply that the cross binding S2 antibodies might have neutralizing activity against diverse CoVs.

[https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.70330.sa1](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.70330.sa1) Author response Essential revisions: In this study, Grobben et al. examines whether binding antibodies that cross-react with the spikes of diverse coronaviruses are elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The manuscript is well written, and the figures are laid out in an easy to interpret manner. This study will be of interest to those who are interested in developing pan coronavirus vaccines. However, the following issues should be addressed before acceptance: 1. What are the relative contributions to the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity in the sera upon depletion of S1 or S2 subdomains? It would be very interesting to assess whether there a reduction of serum neutralizing activity following S2 mAb depletion as would imply that the cross binding S2 antibodies might have neutralizing activity against diverse CoVs. Indeed it would be very interesting to assess neutralizing activity against diverse CoVs, as noted by both reviewers. However, assays to determine neutralizing activity to the seasonal human coronaviruses are quite complicated and therefore can currently not be performed at our laboratory. It could be possible to determine SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity after S1 or S2 subdomain depletion as suggested, however we do not think this would improve general knowledge on function of S2 directed cross-reactive antibodies. This neutralizing potential has been shown in better ways by others as we noted in our discussion. To better explain our limitation and the presence of knowledge on the functionality of S2 antibodies by others, we further elaborated on this in our discussion (lines 361-366). 2. Do the authors have access to human post-vaccine sera? It would be interesting to compare the results of natural infection to vaccination. We thank the reviewer for this interesting suggestion. Hence, we sought a collaboration to investigate the humoral cross-reactivity following Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccination in 45 SARS-CoV-2 na\u00efve individuals and found a similar increase in hCoV antibodies. We incorporated these results in our manuscript (Figure 5 and Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1, and lines 295-311). 3. Could any of the differences in cross reactive binding be due to differences in the stability of the various spike proteins? Presumably all of the spike-ectodomain designs will stabilize the proteins in the pre-fusion state, but it is not demonstrated that they are. Misfolding could lead to the destruction of relevant conformation-dependent cross reactive epitopes. We agree that it would be possible that differences in stability and confirmation may affect our results. We have used the tools available to us to characterize the produced proteins, however due to lack of well-described antibodies we cannot confirm integrity of specific epitopes. We did confirm that all spike proteins formed trimers by BN-PAGE gel and acknowledge that this was missing information in our methods section. To give more insight on our proteins we have added this information (lines 468-472) and the corresponding gel pictures (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5). In addition, we noted conformational differences as a limitation in our Discussion section (lines 340-343). 4. Related to the point 4 above, is the S2 used in the depletion studies in the pre-fusion or post-fusion conformation? Since the 2 conformations are quite different structurally, it's likely that they are antigenically distinct, and may therefore fail to deplete out relevant cross-reactive serum antibodies. The S2 subdomain used in depletion studies was a commercially available reagent consisting of monomeric S2 in the post-fusion state. To the best of our knowledge, no pre-fusion S2 construct has been described yet and therefore this was not available to us. We agree that it would be interesting to repeat the experiment when such a protein would become available as indeed it might further amplify the depletion that we observed. We have added more details about the S2 in both the methods section (line 507-508) and the Results section (line 210). And noted lack of a pre-fusion S2 as a limitation in the discussion (lines 361-363). If neither of the points (3 and 4) can be easily addressed experimentally these caveats should be pointed out in the discussion. We have addressed these points experimentally as much as possible and have included the caveats of this study more clearly in the discussion. 5. The authors suggest that the macaques are likely CoV na\u00efve, however the data suggest that this may not be true. If the animals are truly naive, then all of the cross-reactive antibodies should have been elicited by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and similarly depleted by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. For example, in Figure 4b all of the SARS-CoV-2 spike binding antibodies are depleted by the SARS-CoV-2 spike, but only about 70% of the SARS and OC43 binding antibodies were depleted. Do the authors have an alternative explanation for this? The reviewer raises an important point and we have studied our results in more detail again. Our depletion assay was able to remove a large portion of the antibodies binding to other human CoV spikes. Since the antibody levels for macaques were low, the signal-to-noise ratio in our assay was not very high providing lower sensitivity and in addition some variability was observed. Together, this may be part of the explanation why the depletion rates do not reach 100% in all cases. We cannot fully exclude the possibility that pre-existing immunity in macaques contributed to this incomplete depletion. However, hCoV infections are not frequently described in macaques and SARS-CoV is not a common circulating hCoV. Therefore, it is more likely that this incomplete deletion is associated with assay variability when signal-to-noise ratio are limited (for the alpha hCoVs) and possible conformational differences between the spike proteins (for SARS-CoV). We have noted this in the discussion (lines 340-343). Additionally, we do agree that solely noting that the macaques are assumed to be na\u00efve is not well enough supported by our data and therefore we adapted the discussion to better explain the limitation in our study that the animals were not tested for possible previous coronavirus infections prior to the immunizations (lines 333-336). We repeated our depletion experiment to confirm the incomplete depletion observed for SARS-CoV. We again concluded that we could not fully deplete this serological response. As described above, we think this may be explained by conformation changes between the spike proteins used for immunization and depletion.

Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) plays an essential role as a transcription factor in driving the expression of immune response genes during infection. The striking difference in functional output with other IRFs is that IRF1 also drives the expression of various cell cycle inhibiting factors, making it an important tumor suppressor. Thus, it is critical to regulate the abundance of IRF1 to achieve a 'Goldilocks' zone in which there is sufficient IRF1 to prevent tumorigenesis, yet not too much which could drive excessive immune activation. Using genetic screening, we identified the E3 ligase receptor speckle type BTB/POZ protein (SPOP) to mediate IRF1 proteasomal turnover in human and mouse cells. We identified S/T-rich degrons in IRF1 required for its SPOP MATH domain-dependent turnover. In the absence of SPOP, elevated IRF1 protein levels functionally increased IRF1-dependent cellular responses, underpinning the biological significance of SPOP in curtailing IRF1 protein abundance. "}
