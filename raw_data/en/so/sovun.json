Tranexamic acid (TXA), which impairs plasmin-mediated fibrin clot breakdown, has been used to reduce bleeding following trauma, during surgery, and for menorrhagia low-to-moderate quality evidence that prophylactic TXA may reduce the risk of PPH in some women ( [Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2015 Jun 16;(6):CD007872](http://go.ebsco.com/f00cT0H0Z0002N28LsQan00)), but evidence for treating PPH is limited. To evaluate TXA for treating PPH, the recent WOMAN trial, conducted in 21 countries, randomized 20,060 women 16 years old with PPH to TXA vs. saline IV infusion in addition to usual care (including uterotonic prophylaxis in 96%). PPH was defined as estimated blood loss > 500 mL after vaginal birth, blood loss > 1,000 mL after cesarean section, or any blood loss leading to hemodynamic instability. The specific TXA used was cyklokapron 1 gram (10 mg/mL) administered at 1 mL/minute. Patients had a second dose of the study drug if bleeding continued after 30 minutes or restarted within 24 hours. Cesarean section was performed in 29% of women, and uterine atony was the primary cause of PPH in 64%. TXA significantly reduced the risk of death due to bleeding, which occurred in 1.5% with TXA vs. 1.9% with saline (risk ratio 0.81, 95% CI 0.65-1, NNT 250). The difference was greater among the pre-specified subgroup of 14,928 women who had the study drug within 3 hours of delivery (1.2% vs. 1.7%, risk ratio 0.69, 95% CI 0.52-0.91, NNT 200) and was not significant among the subgroup of women who had the drug > 3 hours after delivery (in 2.6% vs. 2.5%). TXA did not significantly reduce the risk of hysterectomy (in 3.6% vs. 3.5%), all-cause mortality (in 2.3% vs. 2.6%), or death due to pulmonary embolism, organ failure, sepsis, or eclampsia (each in < 0.3% of the cohort). There were also no significant differences between groups in rates of thromboembolic events (in 0.3% in both groups) or other complications. This trial demonstrates that IV tranexamic acid (TXA) administered within 3 hours of delivery reduces the risk of death due to bleeding in women with postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). The absolute risk reduction is small, but the relative risk reduction is moderate-to-large. The analyses based on time of TXA administration should be taken as evidence that the benefit of TXA may decrease with longer delays from delivery, rather than evidence that TXA is ineffective if administered > 3 hours after delivery specifically. TXA did not reduce hysterectomy rates. This may be partially explained by the observation that the decision to perform a hysterectomy was often made when the patient was enrolled, reducing the potential influence of TXA on hysterectomy rates (the precise number of these cases was not reported). Also, TXA did not significantly reduce all-cause mortality. However, the direction and magnitude of risk difference in all-cause mortality is consistent with that of death due to bleeding; the non-significant differences in death due to other causes may have diluted the beneficial effects of TXA on all-cause mortality. Despite the caveats, this large multinational randomized trial provides the first high-quality evidence that early IV administration of TXA in addition to usual care reduces death due to bleeding following PPH. For more information, see the [Postpartum hemorrhage](http://go.ebsco.com/wNZQs0TLH0000n2b008210c) topic in pregnancy include pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, gestational hypertension, and chronic hypertension. As a group, these disorders represent the second most common direct cause of maternal mortality in both developed countries (16% of all maternal deaths) and developing countries (9-25% of all maternal deaths) behind hemorrhage ( [Lancet. 2006;367(9516):1066](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Lancet.+2006%3B367(9516)%3A1066)). Options for first-line treatment of acute severe hypertension in pregnant women include labetalol (either IV bolus or continuous infusion), nifedipine (oral), hydralazine (IV bolus or continuous infusion), or methyldopa (ACOG Recommendation, Moderate Evidence; [Obstet Gynecol. 2013 Nov;122(5):1122](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24150027)). While hydralazine was historically the drug of choice for severe maternal hypertension, it has fallen out of favor due to evidence of increased maternal and fetal complications associated with its use ( [BMJ 2003;327:955](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14576246); [BMJ 1999;318:1332](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10323823)). Currently, the usage pattern among health care providers suggests a strong preference for labetalol in this setting. A recent Cochrane review of 35 randomized trials comparing different antihypertensive drugs showed that use of calcium channel blockers (nifedipine, isradipine) was associated with decreased persistent high blood pressure compared to hydralazine. However, there was insufficient data regarding the comparative effects of labetalol and nifedipine ( [Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2013 Jul 31;(7):CD001449](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23900968)). This raises the question: despite the general tendency towards the use of labetalol for treatment of severe hypertension in pregnancy, is nifedipine a better choice? A systematic review of 7 randomized trials compared oral nifedipine to IV labetalol in 363 pregnant women with severe hypertension in their second or third trimester of pregnancy. Dosing varied across trials for both medications, but most commonly women received nifedipine 50-90 mg or labetalol 220-300 mg. Primary maternal outcomes were persistent hypertension, maternal hypotension, and serious maternal morbidity. Primary perinatal outcomes included fetal heart rate abnormalities while on treatment, intrauterine fetal death and neonatal death. Compared to IV labetalol, oral nifedipine was associated with a decreased risk of persistent maternal hypertension in analysis of all trials (risk ratio [RR] 0.42, 95% CI 0.18 - 0.96, NNT maternal hypertension in 8% of the labetalol group). The wide confidence interval that approaches 1 includes the possibility of a clinically insignificant effect. Oral nifedipine was also associated with a decreased risk of neonatal death in analysis of 4 trials with 221 patients (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.09 - 0.87, NNT occurring in 10% of the labetalol group). Risk of maternal side effects was lower with oral nifedipine than with IV labetalol in analysis of 3 trials with 207 patients (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.35-0.94, NNT 5-53 with maternal side effects in 32% of the labetalol group). There were no significant differences in the risk of other maternal or fetal and perinatal outcomes including maternal death, serious maternal morbidity, hypotension, cesarean section, intrauterine death, fetal heart rate abnormalities, low Apgar score, or neonatal intensive care unit admission. The authors acknowledge that this study is limited by a low to moderate quality of evidence of the included studies and a small number of studies to date. These concerns limit the strength of the overall findings that oral nifedipine may decrease the risk of neonatal death and maternal side effects when compared to IV labetalol. Nifedipine does have low cost and ease of oral administration, and could be considered by clinicians for urgent control of severe hypertension in pregnancy, particularly in resource-limited settings.

Palliative options include therapeutic pleural aspiration if life expectancy is < 1 month, intercostal tube drainage followed by chemical pleurodesis, thoracoscopy with drainage and chemical pleurodesis, and ambulatory tunneled catheter drainage in selected patients ( [British Thoracic Society Pleural Disease Guideline 2010](http://go.ebsco.com/JN2HL8082Q0sd7Z0Tn00000)). Tunneled catheters may remain in place for weeks to months, allowing outpatients to regularly drain pleural fluid, promoting pleural contact and adhesion and eventual pleurodesis ( [Trials 2015 Feb 12;16:48](http://go.ebsco.com/wNZQs0TLH0000n2e0082907)). A survey of thoracic surgeons indicates that guidance on the best frequency of pleural drainage is needed ( [Interact Cardiovasc Thorac Surg 2017 Mar 1;24(3):414](http://go.ebsco.com/ga0Z0sH08202NQ0TL000f7n)). To address this question, the ASAP trial included 162 adults with malignancy and symptomatic recurrent pleural effusion who were responsive to thoracentesis. The patients were randomized to daily vs. every other day drainage via tunneled pleural catheter for 12 weeks. Patients with loculated pleural effusion or trapped lung were excluded. The primary outcome was autopleurodesis (complete and partial), defined as 50 mL pleural fluid on 3 consecutive drainages and lack of symptoms including shortness of breath, cough, or chest pain. When there was no radiographic evidence of effusion or blunting of the costophrenic angle only, the autopleurodesis was considered to be complete, and when the radiographic blunting extended beyond the costophrenic angle, the autopleurodesis was considered to be partial. Despite randomization, baseline differences included higher rates of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism and bilateral pleural effusion in the daily drainage group and higher rates of lung cancer, chronic kidney disease, hypothyroidism, and hypertension in the every other day drainage group (statistical comparisons were not reported). Autopleurodesis occurred in 47% of patients in the daily drainage group vs. 24% of patients in the every other day group (p = 0.003, NNT 5) with a complete response observed in 30% vs. 16%, respectively (p = 0.037, NNT 7). The median time to autopleurodesis was 54 days with daily drainage vs. 90 days with every other day drainage (p = 0.005). No significant differences in adverse events were observed between the two groups, with pain upon drainage in 34% with daily drainage vs. 38% with every other day drainage, catheter occlusion in 11% vs. 5%, and any infection in 4% vs. 1%. The ASAP trial showed that daily drainage of tunneled pleural catheters increased the likelihood of autopleurodesis and decreased the median time to autopleurodesis by 36 days compared to every other day drainage. The treatment arms were not balanced at baseline for some conditions potentially influencing the outcome, with higher rates of thromboembolic disease in the daily drainage group and higher rates of chronic kidney disease, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and lung cancer in the every other day drainage group. These differences may have been reflected in the mortality difference between the groups, with death occurring in 25% in the daily drainage group and in 34% of the every other day drainage group. This potential confounding despite randomization decreases the confidence in the estimated size of the effect. Moreover, the rate of autopleurodesis in the every other day group in the ASAP trial (24%) is lower than that reported in other trials (46%-51%) in patients with indwelling pleural catheters with recommended every other day or three times weekly drainage. This comparison, however, is complicated because these trials had longer periods of follow-up and did not strictly control drainage frequency ( [Cancer 1999 Nov 15;86(10):1992](http://go.ebsco.com/s0b70H20ZNsg0L080n20T0Q), [JAMA 2012 Jun 13;307(22):2383](http://go.ebsco.com/z08Z2TH0000Nsc72Lnh0Q00)). With these considerations in mind, daily drainage of tunneled pleural catheters may decrease time to autopleurodesis compared to every other day drainage in patients with malignant pleural effusion who may not want to undergo chemical pleurodesis.

Guidelines recommend against routine antibiotic use in patients without confirmed group A streptococcus infection however, antibiotics are often prescribed ( [BMJ Open 2014 Oct 27;4(10):e006245](http://go.ebsco.com/l3N8A000H2Zn0Q2T00s0z0L), [Fam Pract 2015 Aug;32(4):401](http://go.ebsco.com/ZNs0n02BT000080ZA20HQL3)). A single dose of corticosteroids is a possible non-antibiotic option to reduce inflammation and pain, but most evidence assessing its efficacy includes patients taking concurrent antibiotics ( [Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2012 Oct 17;(10):CD008268](http://go.ebsco.com/j8CN022HL000Z0nsQTB0300)). To assess the effect of corticosteroids on pain, the recent TOAST trial randomized 565 adults (median 34 years old) who presented to a primary care practice for acute pharyngitis to dexamethasone 10 mg orally once vs. placebo. In 96% of cases, patients reported their symptoms to be moderate-to-severe. All cases had a suspected infectious etiology but were judged to not require immediate antibiotic therapy. However, 40% of patients were offered a delayed antibiotic prescription, to be filled in 48 hours if symptoms did not improve. Rapid streptococcal antigen tests were not available to inform treatment, but culture results were positive for streptococcus (most commonly Group A) in 16.7% of the 502 patients with available data. Over-the-counter medications were allowed. Follow-up was achieved via telephone interview or text message. Complete symptom resolution within 48 hours was reported in 35.4% of patients taking dexamethasone vs. 27.1% with placebo (95% CI for risk difference 1.2% to 16.2%, NNT 12), with consistent findings in patients who were not offered a delayed antibiotic prescription. The risk difference in patients who were offered a delayed antibiotic prescription favored dexamethasone but was not statistically significant. Dexamethasone was also associated with a non-significantly greater likelihood of complete symptom resolution within 24 hours (22.6% vs. 17.7%, 95% CI for risk difference -1.8% to +11.2%). There were no statistically significant differences between groups in median time to onset of pain relief (27.5 vs. 27 hours), median time to complete symptom resolution (65.8 vs. 60 hours), pain severity, or serious adverse events (2 with dexamethasone and 3 with placebo). This trial demonstrates that a single dose of dexamethasone 10 mg orally may lead to an increased likelihood of symptom resolution within 48 hours in adults with acute pharyngitis. Unlike previous trials, this trial focused exclusively on corticosteroid use without concurrent antibiotics. The effect is moderate, the confidence interval in risk difference includes clinically unimportant differences, and the effect was not significant at 24 hours. However, the confidence intervals also include larger effects, and the direction of benefit is consistent with the beneficial effect of corticosteroids in numerous smaller trials ( [Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2012 Oct 17;(10):CD008268](http://go.ebsco.com/j8CN022HL000Z0nsQTB0300)). Given the common occurrence of this condition, the relative simplicity of single-dose oral corticosteroids, and concerns over antibiotic overprescription, this trial lends support to considering single-dose corticosteroids for acute pharyngitis.

[Read the full EBM be associated with an increased risk of emergency cesarean delivery for fetal distress, admission to a neonatal intensive care unit, and meconium aspiration syndrome compared to pregnancies with normal amniotic fluid index (AFI) ( [Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol 2017 Apr;49(4):442](http://go.ebsco.com/m000sP20008T1HnZNZT0LQ0)). Limited information regarding its management is available and options in the third trimester include maternal hydration ( [Cochrane Database Syst Rev Perinatol. 2011 Mar;38(1):33](http://go.ebsco.com/es0ZVQ02000NLZ0801RHn0T)), and labor 2000 Nov;96(5 Pt 2):861](http://go.ebsco.com/wNZQs0TLH0000n1S0082W0Z)). A recent investigated the effect of adding sildenafil citrate to hydration therapy on AFI and obstetrical outcomes in 184 women (mean age 30 years) with a singleton pregnancy (median 32.4 weeks gestation) with idiopathic oligohydramnios (AFI < 5 cm). The women were randomized to hydration therapy plus sildenafil citrate 25 mg orally every 8 hours vs. hydration therapy alone until delivery. Hydration therapy consisted of IV infusion of 2 L of isotonic solution over 4 hours once, with a repeat infusion if there was < 20% increase in AFI after 24 hours, and instructions to drink 2 L of fluid daily after discharge. The primary outcome, AFI, was determined by one ultrasonographer blinded to treatment allocation at twice weekly outpatient assessments. The median AFI was increased in the sildenafil citrate group compared to the hydration only group starting at 1 week after treatment and remained so after 6 weeks (11.5 cm vs. 5.35 cm, p = 0.02). Pregnancy was prolonged in the sildenafil citrate group with delivery occurring at a median gestational age of 38.3 weeks vs. 36 weeks (p = 0.001). In addition, there were lower rates of adverse obstetrical outcomes in the sildenafil citrate group with cesarean delivery in 28% vs. 72.6% (p = 0.001, NNT 3), 5-minute Apgar score < 7 in 9.8% vs. 31% (p = 0.001, NNT 5), umbilical artery pH < 7.2 in 7.3% vs. 20.2% (p = 0.016, NNT 0.001, NNT 3), and neonatal admission to the intensive care unit in 11% vs. 41% (p = 0.001, NNT 4). The results of this trial suggest that the addition of sildenafil citrate to hydration therapy increases the AFI and improves obstetrical outcomes. The reduced rates of adverse obstetrical outcomes are difficult to interpret. The rate of cesarean section was much higher in the hydration only group and may have partially resulted from a lower threshold by the obstetricians to intervene in the women with a low AFI, particularly since the study was not blinded and well defined criteria for the induction of labor or use of cesarean section were not stated. The higher rates of adverse neonatal outcomes may be partly due to the lower gestational age of the neonates in the hydration only group (which itself may reflect the increased rates of iatrogenic pre-term delivery). In addition, the clinical significance of the increased rates of meconium staining is unclear as the rates of meconium aspiration syndrome were not reported. In summary, sildenafil citrate may increase the amniotic fluid index, but additional studies that account for the potential influence of delivery management are needed to evaluate its clinical benefit in women with idiopathic oligohydramnios.

[Probiotics for preventing acute upper respiratory tract infections](http://go.ebsco.com/jLwN012HL000D0PsQTU0W00). Hao Q, Dong BR, Wu T, Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2015 Feb 3;(2):CD006895 A healthy middle aged woman complains of cough, fever, nasal congestion and runny nose for the past 3 days. After a reassuring physical exam, you diagnose the patient with an acute upper respiratory infection (URI) and advise supportive treatment. Your patient is worried about spreading the infection to her family. She has heard that probiotics may prevent URI, and she asks if \"they really work\". This Cochrane review included a systematic review of the medical literature and identified 13 randomized controlled trials of probiotics in patients with URI with 3,780 patients; 12 studies had data extracted for meta-analysis. There were 8 trials of 2,571 children, 3 trials of 995 adults aged 18-65 years, and 2 trials of 214 older adults. The trials were conducted in various countries including Chile, Croatia, Finland, Japan, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, and the United States. The participants received either probiotics for more than seven days, placebo or no treatment. Most of the studies were of low quality due to unclear randomization methods and blinding as well as small sample sizes. There was also a high level of clinical heterogeneity due to different outcome measures, single or mixture of probiotic strains at various dosage regimens and routes of administration, and varied patient populations. Probiotics reduced the number of patients experiencing one acute URI (odds ratio [OR] 0.53, 95% CI 0.37- 0.76; NNT 6-18) in analysis of 7 trials with 1,927 patients. This benefit was seen when all studies were combined and when only children were analyzed, but not in the single study of adults and the single study of older adults. Probiotics also reduced the number of patients who experienced at least three acute URIs (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.36- 0.81, NNT 6-24) in analysis of 3 trials with 650 patients. The duration of an acute URI episode was reduced by a mean difference of 1.89 days (95% CI 1.75-2.04 days) in analysis of 3 studies with 768 adults. Probiotics also reduced both antibiotic prescription rates (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.45-0.94, NNT 19-184) in analysis of 4 trials with 1,184 patients, and URI-related school absences (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.02- 0.47, NNT 3-5) in analysis of 1 trial with 80 patients. Adverse events were similar between groups and only minor side effects were noted (most commonly gastrointestinal symptoms). This Cochrane review demonstrates that probiotics may prevent acute URI in children, and they may also help in reducing the duration of acute URI in adults. In addition, they may decrease the number of school absences and reduce antibiotic prescription rates. However, the studies were clinically heterogeneous, and some results had wide confidence intervals (including the possibility of no clinically significant difference). The heterogeneity also means that no specific probiotic formulation can be currently recommended. More high-quality randomized trials are needed to confirm and refine these conclusions.

Spirometry at diagnosis can also help to direct therapy. Despite recommendations, spirometry is not always used when diagnosing COPD ( Feb;145(2):272](http://go.ebsco.com/wNZQs0TLH0000n1e0082n0U), [Chest 2007 Aug;132(2):403](http://go.ebsco.com/Q0UQ0ZN0Lo2H80s1T00f0n0), [Respir Med 2010 Apr;104(4):550](http://go.ebsco.com/o02ps00gU001nL00ZQNT8H0)). One reason may be that evidence on the effect of spirometry for COPD diagnosis on morbidity and mortality is lacking. To address this deficit, a recent retrospective cohort study in Ontario, Canada used national databases to assess the clinical benefit of peridiagnostic spirometry, defined as spirometry conducted before or after bronchodilation beginning 1 year before the earliest COPD-related health service visit to the date of COPD diagnosis. The study included 68,898 adults (mean age about 69 years old) with physician-diagnosed COPD between 2005 and 2012, where physician-diagnosed COPD was defined as age 35 years plus either 1 COPD-related hospital admission or 3 COPD-related ambulatory care visits within 2 years of each other. Peridiagnostic spirometry was conducted in 41.2% of the population and was associated with differences in most baseline characteristics, including younger age (mean 67 vs. 70 years old), greater likelihood of specialist and guideline-based care, and lower likelihood of comorbidities. Risk analyses for clinical outcomes were adjusted for propensity scores (the probability, based on many demographic and clinical baseline characteristics, that a patient would have peridiagnostic spirometry) and spirometry before or after the peridiagnostic period. The primary outcome of COPD-related hospital admission or death from any cause was observed in about 38% of the patients. In adjusted analyses of the entire study population, peridiagnostic spirometry was associated with a reduced risk of the primary outcome (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.91, 95% CI 0.89-0.94). In subgroup analyses, the risk was reduced in patients with COPD diagnosed during ambulatory visits, but not for patients with COPD diagnosed during in-patient hospitalization. In patients 67 years old, for whom data on medication use for 2 years before COPD diagnosis was available, peridiagnostic spirometry was associated with an increased likelihood of new COPD-related prescriptions. In these patients, extending adjustments to include medication use eliminated the effects of spirometry. This population-based retrospective cohort study demonstrated that spirometry around the time of COPD diagnosis was associated with a modest reduced risk of COPD-related hospital admission or death from any cause in adults who had COPD diagnosed in the ambulatory setting. The retrospective observational study design limits conclusions regarding the causative effect of peridiagnostic spirometry on outcomes. However, the use of propensity scores (which take into account many baseline demographic and clinical factors) and other factors to adjust risk analyses, and subgroup analyses, increases confidence that spirometry for diagnosis may be beneficial and enables speculation regarding how it may be beneficial. For example, the pathway by which spirometry benefits patients may be that it helps direct medication selection, a finding that agrees with an earlier study ( [Eur Respir J 2006 Nov;28(5):945](http://go.ebsco.com/E0T0L0nhNqZ0s08Q2U00H01)). Regardless of the possible mechanisms, this study provides the best evidence to date in support of guideline recommendations to confirm COPD diagnosis with spirometry in symptomatic patients.

The benefits of levodopa or dopamine agonist monotherapies can wane over time with the patient experiencing motor fluctuations defined as a switch from on time (relief of parkinsonian motor features) to a period of \"off\" time (return of parkinsonian motor features). In addition, drug-induced involuntary movements (dyskinesia) may develop. In order to reduce off time, adjunctive therapies with catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors (only in combination with levodopa), MAO-B inhibitors, or dopamine agonists may be given. Safinamide, a selective, reversible MAO-B inhibitor additional non-dopaminergic mechanisms of action ( [Front 2016;7:340](http://go.ebsco.com/I010SLZ0H0nFsT280Q0NQ00)), was approved by the [Food and Drug Administration](http://go.ebsco.com/AQ0G00LN20sT1n800H0T0ZQ) in March 2017 as an add-on treatment for patients with PD who are taking levodopa/carbidopa and who experience off time. To evaluate its efficacy to reduce off time, the SETTLE trial included 549 patients (mean age 62 years) with idiopathic PD for > 3 years and taking stable oral levodopa with or without adjuvant therapy randomized to adjuvant safinamide 50-100 mg orally once daily at breakfast vs. placebo for 24 weeks. All patients had > 1.5 hours of off time (return of bradykinesia and rigidity other than morning akinesia) per day despite treatment optimization during the run-in phase. Adjunctive therapies included dopamine agonists in 17.3%, and entacapone in 15.1%. The primary outcome was the mean change from baseline to week 24 in on time without troublesome dyskinesia, as determined by diary entries from the 2 days preceding outcome assessments. Comparing safinamide with placebo, daily on time without troublesome dyskinesia increased from baseline by 1.42 hours vs. 0.57 hours (mean difference 0.96 hours, 95% CI 0.56-1.37). Patients in the safinamide group also had greater improvement in motor function during on time based on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III score (-3.43 vs. -1.83, mean difference -1.82, 95% CI -3.01 to -0.62). Improvements in the activities of daily living UPDRS Part II scores during on time were similar between the groups. Serious adverse events occurred in 6.6% with safinamide vs. 9.5% with placebo (statistical comparison not reported). Rates of dyskinesia were 14.6% with safinamide vs. 5.5% with placebo, falls were reported in 6.6% vs. 3.6%, and discontinuation of study drug due to adverse events occurred in 4.4% vs. 3.6% (statistical comparisons not reported). The SETTLE trial showed that the addition of safinamide to levodopa significantly increased mean daily on time without troublesome dyskinesia by about 1 hour compared to placebo in patients with PD. The relevance of the statistically significant greater improvement in the UPDRS motor score seen in the safinamide group is unclear as the 95% confidence interval for the difference in improvement between groups includes clinically unimportant values (< 2.3 points, [Arch Neurol 2010 Jan;67(1):64](http://go.ebsco.com/a0200H018L0Z00HQUNsQ0nT)). Head-to-head trials to evaluate the comparative efficacy and tolerability of safinamide with the established adjunctive therapies are needed. In the meantime, safinamide is a recently available treatment option to consider as adjunct therapy to increase on time in patients with early- to mid-stage PD who are taking levodopa.

The attacks can lead to disability lasting several days at a time and, potentially, death, depending on the location of swelling. On-demand medications to treat attacks are available, but swelling may take several hours to resolve. Long-term prophylactic therapies that reduce the frequency of attacks include oral steroids and antifibrinolytics, which may have significant adverse effects, and C1 inhibitor replacement therapy, which has good efficacy and safety but requires IV administration ( [J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2013 Jun;131(6):1491](http://go.ebsco.com/uNs000ZN0H0T0u02Kn8LQ10)). To assess the efficacy of C1 inhibitor replacement with a more practical administration, 90 patients 12 years old (mean age 40 years) with types I or II hereditary angioedema were randomized in the COMPACT trial to 1 of 2 crossover groups. The first group was randomized to self-administered C1 inhibitor CSL830 40 units/kg subcutaneous injection twice weekly vs. placebo for 16 weeks, followed by crossover to other treatment for 16 weeks without a washout. The second group followed the same design except had CSL830 dose 60 units/kg. All patients had 4 attacks over 2 months within the previous 3 months and were allowed treatment, including IV C1 inhibitor replacement, as rescue medication or preprocedure prophylaxis during the trial. The trial protocol was amended during enrollment to allow patients to continue with established stable prophylactic oral medication (in 42%), but patients were excluded for routine IV C1 inhibitor prophylaxis within the previous 3 months or planned use during the trial. Patients were also excluded for C1 inhibitory activity 50%, normal C4 antigen levels, features of acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, history of poor response to C1 inhibitor therapy, and medication-refractory attacks. Efficacy assessment was based on patient-reported daily diaries, excluding the first 2 weeks of treatment periods to account for run-in/washout from the previous treatment. Eleven patients (12%) did not complete both treatment periods. For patients allocated to CSL830 40 units/kg, the mean number of attacks per month was 1.19 while taking CSL830 vs. 3.61 with placebo (p< 0.001), with complete remission from attacks in 38% vs. 9% (statistical comparison not reported). The frequency of attacks while taking CSL830 40 units/kg was reduced by 50% compared to placebo in 76% of patients, and by 90% in 43%. While on CSL830 40 units/kg, the patients used rescue medications less frequently (mean 1.13 vs. 5.55 uses/month, p = 0.02) and had fewer days/month with symptoms (mean 1.57 vs. 7, statistical comparison not reported). CSL830 dose 60 units/kg had a greater benefit on most outcomes, but not significantly so. Adverse events were reported in 69% while on CSL830 (both doses) and 66% with placebo (statistical comparison not reported), and serious events included urosepsis in 1 patient with CSL830 and pulmonary embolism, angioedema, and syncope in 2 patients with placebo. The COMPACT trial demonstrated that twice-weekly self-administered subcutaneous injections of the C1 inhibitor CSL830 decreases the frequency of angioedema attacks in patients 12 years old with types I or II hereditary angioedema, providing a potential prophylactic C1 inhibitor replacement option that is more practical than previous options. Additional studies are needed to assess long-term efficacy and safety, optimal dosing, treatment adherence among patients who do not choose to participate in a clinical trial, and comparisons with established long-term prophylactic options. Nonetheless, subcutaneous CSL830, when it becomes available, may be an option for long-term prophylactic therapy for types I or II hereditary angioedema.
