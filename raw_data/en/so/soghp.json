All of the cleanse programs include colon hydrotherapy sessions to rapidly release toxins from the body and prevent them from being re-absorbed. Unlike other cleanse programs, the Natural Flow cleanses do not require fasting or hunger making compliance much easier. The staff at Natural Flow is available to provide diet recommendations, cleansing advice, and moral support throughout the program.
