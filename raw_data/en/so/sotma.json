At the Orthopaedic Research Center, our principal focus continues to be solving the significant problems in equine musculoskeletal disease (as can be seen in this report) but we also continue to increase our investigation of comparative problems and questions relevant to human joint disease and joint injury including techniques and devices for human osteoarthritis and articular cartilage repair when the technique can potentially benefit the horse. The increased number of translational projects and funding support from the National Institute of Health (NIH) and human orientated industry partners support our mission of helping both horses and humans. As part of that evolution in June 2017 we broke ground on the new Translational Medicine Institute (TMI) and on the 6th of May 2019 (it might be noted that I am writing this Preface sometime after the 2017-2018 years that we are reporting on!) we moved into the TMI. As some of you will remember, the TMI was initially described as the Institute of Biological Translational Therapies but people were having difficulty with this name and understanding what we did. In March 2016 we completed the matching challenge from our lead donors John and Leslie Malone of one half the cost of the building with a $10 million commitment from Colorado State University (per then President Dr. Tony Frank) and $20 million from Abigail K. Kawananakoa and moved forward quickly from then. As I write this preface for our 2017- 2018, we have settled into the TMI. It is an incredible facility that is providing the unique abilities for research, education and entrepreneurial development of biologic therapies. The mission of the TMI is to improve the lives of animals and humans through biologic therapies created via the collaborative work of leading scientists and clinicians; to expedite the availability of these therapies, and to promote education related to these goals. Our vision is, leading the way in discovery and implementation of the body's therapeutics to improve the lives of animals and their humans. This vision that was developed by a TMI Steering Committee led by Dr. Dave Frisbie and supported by our lead donors John and Leslie Malone and by our matching donor Abigail K. Kawananakoa has a focus on investigating the next generation remedies based on living cells and their products including patient derived stem cells to treat musculoskeletal disease and other ailments and to literally be able to carry basic science discoveries in the TMI all the way to bedside with entrepreneurial and regulatory abilities within the TMI. The work and accomplishments of the excellent team we developed at the Orthopaedic Research Center (ORC) led to this vision and the Institute. The expertise we established in analyzing and developing medical treatments for animal patients, and then providing knowledge gained to boost 2 ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH CENTERhuman medical advancements, goes along with the concept of translational medicine and is successful because of similarities in animal and human physiology and disease. The funding and building of the TMI in a two- and one-half year period is truly transformational and will certainly take us to a higher level. It is also an endorsement of what we have achieved already. Those achievements have come from a combination of ingenuity and work of our faculty, research associates, graduate students, veterinary students and undergraduate students as well as the critical help of our donors. Our continued evolution has been greatly strengthened by the addition of other principal investigators and programs to the ORC and Orthopaedic Bioengineering including, the Preclinical Surgical Research Laboratory led by co-directors Jeremiah Easley and Howard Simon as well as the programs of Drs. Steve Dow and Mike Lappin. These additions have brought additional talent along with postdoctoral researchers, graduate students and research associates. Each of our components continue to grow. The Orthopaedic Research Center will continue to be a major component of the TMI, but our other partners give us considerable strength and Reports such as this will continue to evolve as one major entity. I would like to acknowledge our partners Tetrad, the developers for the building together with their partners Clark Ennison Architects and JE Dunn the contractors. Dr. Dave Frisbie worked closely with Tetrad in all aspects of the building and what we have in this remarkable facility. Dave deserves much credit for what we have in this facility in terms of appropriateness of what we have as he and, as mentioned previously the TMI Steering Committee was also critical to the process. We continue to evolve as a facility particularly with the large step up in continuing education (CE), and imaging, as well as research. Achieving what we envisioned with the TMI is continuing to evolve with the Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) selecting projects for support based on their potential to find new therapies and advances. Two other major items that are critical to achieving our goals in advanced equine health are the Gail Holmes Equine Orthopaedic Research Center transitioning to a Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation Center under the leadership of Dr. Melissa King as well as funding of phase 1 of a new Equine Veterinary Teaching Hospital under the leadership of, Director of Equine Clinical Services, Dr. Chris Kawcak. Currently our Transitional Leadership Team is working carefully to evaluate what we need for optimal progress in the TMI. The step up in both facility and management of our added programs, has been a learning curve as one continues to grow, I have handed over my leadership roles and have the pleasure of looking back on 39 years of progress that would not have been possible without the terrific support of the faculty and staff as well as the support of our research funders and donors.

Ferris 2010-2013 2015 E. Contino 2011-2014 2015 J. Donnell 2012-2015 Manchon SYNOPSISPROGRAM SYNOPSIS Center (ORC) began as a multidisciplinary equine program dedicated to finding methods to treat and prevent equine musculoskel- etal disease and injury. Prior to 1984, the program's research was primarily clinical. During this time, many of the techniques for arthroscopic surgery currently used to treat joint problems more effectively and to enable continued athletic function were developed at CSU. We also identified and defined a number of new clinical conditions and documented some of the best methods for diagnosis and treatment. The goals of our program are summarized in our research focuses. As we developed arthroscopic surgical techniques to treat these clinical conditions, we identified limitations in terms of secondary osteoarthritis (OA) and articular cartilage loss and this led into phase two of our pro- gram of finding solutions through scientific research. A major goal of the program has always been to find solutions to musculoskeletal problems, especially joint injuries and arthritis. As clinicians and researchers, we strive to offer the best possible treatment of clinical cases with continual and critical assessment of the results, which are then used to modify treatments and direct the research toward disease prevention. The program's goals are to use state-of-the-art research techniques to find new methods to rehabilitate dam- aged joints, to prevent or decrease the occurrence of joint disease and musculoskeletal injuries and meth- ods of early detection, and develop better treatments to prevent permanent damage to injured joints and val- idate manual therapies and rehabilitation techniques. The ORC now includes the Orthopaedic Bioengineer- ing Research Laboratory (OBRL), and we function as a single unit. The ORC and OBRL, together with the Pre-clinical Surgical Research Laboratory (previ- ously Small Ruminant Orthopaedic Research), and Orthopaedic Oncology make up the Musculoskeletal Research Program, which is a Program of Research and Scholarly Excellence at Colorado State University. This designation of PRSE to us was originally granted in 2004, and has been renewed in 2008, 2012 and 2016. The significant collaborations with the College of Engineering, School of Bioengineering, as well as the Department of Health and Exercise Sciences, 66 ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH CENTERPROGRAM SYNOPSIS has added considerably to our research strengths. In recent years, considerable human-based funding (Orthopaedic Foundations, NIH, and corporate grants) has added to our support. Another significant addition to the ORC has been the development of the equine ambulatory sports medicine service and an Equine Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation Residency Program. This followed the accreditation of the new American College of Veteri- nary Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation specialty and four of our faculty being made Charter Diplomates. Since that time, we have added four Diplomates (board certified in the American College of Veterinary Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation (equine specialty). As faculty, they support an ever expanding clinical and research program in equine sports medicine and reha- bilitation. This has led to both considerable clinical and research advancements in the rapidly emerging field. Most recently, we have achieved funding of $65 mil- lion to build the Translational Medicine Institute (initially called the Institute of Biologic Translational Therapies) that is going to take us to a new level in orthopaedic research in translational musculoskeletal research (as well as allied areas of biologic therapies and stem cell research), doing what we have always done for horses but greatly expanding our efforts in human musculo-skeletal disease. This was made possible by a lead gift of $35 million from John and Leslie Malone, $10 million from CSU and the $20 million matching gift from Prin- cess Abigail K. Kawananakoa of Hawaii. Research Activities The following are the research focuses of the ORC. Updates of recent and current projects of 2017-2018 can be found on pages 102-192. 1. Musculoskeletal Tissue Healing Until a few years ago, we have principally addressed articular cartilage healing and continue to do so, but we have enlarged the focus to include bone tendons, ligaments, and menisci. Projects published in 2017-2018 relevant to this focus include 2. Early Diagnosis of Bone and Joint Disease This area includes the development of novel imaging techniques (present and future), body fluid biomark - ers, and also molecular monitoring. The uses of these early diagnostic techniques include a) Evaluation of the pathogenesis of musculoskeletal disease, b) Early detection of disease processes, and c) Monitoring of therapy, with the long-term goal of preventing severe 2017-18 REPORT 67PROGRAM SYNOPSIS osteoarthritis or failure of joints, tendons, ligaments, and menisci. Work in biomarkers has progressed into imaging biomarkers with particular emphasis on the use of ultrasonography, MRI and computed tomog- raphy (CT) in diagnosing early disease change in the limb. Considerable work has also been accomplished using subject-specific finite element modeling of the equine metacarpal phalangeal joint which helps us better understand the stresses that play a role in injury of this critical joint. There were a number of studies in 2017-2018 of impor- tance in the area of early diagnosis of bone and joint disease. A study on the relationship between lesions and performance outcome in survey radiographs of yearlings placed in the repository at the National Cutting Horse Association futurity sale showed that despite many previous concerns with lesions in the femorotibial articulation, radiologic lesions of the medial femoral condyle of the stifle including minor defects through complete subchondral cystic lesions were not significantly associated with performance outcomes.3. Improvement in the Understanding of the Pathogenesis of Musculoskeletal Disease Catastrophic injury is a major problem in the equine athletic industry and we, as well as researchers else- where, have demonstrated that the severe fractures and injuries start as microfractures in the subchondral bone. Our ongoing mission is to develop methods of detecting this damage in the clinical patient before it becomes severe, irreversible damage. Exercising horses have been followed with imaging techniques including computed tomography (CT) and MRI, nuclear scintigraphy, defined sentinels of early damage, and fluid biomarkers as a means of identifying horses at risk studied with promising results. 4. Continued Development of Novel Therapies for Traumatic Synovitis, Capsulitis, and Osteoarthritis in the Horse Objective evaluation of currently available pharma- ceutical agents as well as new biological therapies have been a significant focus of our work. These eval- uations also include examination of specific biological 68 ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH CENTERPROGRAM SYNOPSIS inhibitors including gene therapy, novel protein ther- apies, and mesenchymal stem cells therapies. These newer therapies offer the potential of inhibiting the disease process sufficiently early so that the need for palliative drugs currently used is decreased. Recent projects summarized in 5. Validation of Rehabilitation and Physical Therapy Techniques for Musculoskeletal Disease This is a newer focus that includes objective assess- ment of integrative therapies including physical manipulation, chiropractice and acupuncture for man- agement of musculoskeletal disease and pain as well as rehabilitative techniques of swimming, under water treadmilling and hyperbaric therapy. This area also includes study of the pathogenesis of musculoskele- tal problems bio-mechanically and using gait analysis (kinetics, kinematics) and electromyography (EMG), as well as novel methods of pain detection. In recent years, the Orthopaedic Research Center has acquired the personnel and technical abilities to do more sophisticated research in the area of rehabilitation to address critical questions at a more basic level. The rehabilitation research has been led by Dr. Melissa King. In a paper published in 2017, we showed overall improvements in thoracic limb function, joint range of motion and synovial membrane integrity and signifi- cant reduction in synovial membrane inflammation in experimental osteoarthritis with underwater treadmill exercise. The reduction in inflammation resulted in sig- nificant clinical improvement with regard to symmet- ric thoracic limb loading, uniform activation patterns, patterns of select thoracic limb muscles and return to baseline values for carpal joint flexion, compared with results for horses with simulated hand walking. Impact as a Preeminent Equine Orthopaedic Research Program Both nationally and internationally, the Orthopaedic Research Center provides critical new findings of sig- nificant clinical impact and has been able to attract talented students who wish to pursue careers in orthopaedic research. Students choose this program because of its excellent reputation and because of the opportunities they have to be involved in research during their under-graduate and pre-veterinary pro- grams. Many pre-veterinary students have served as volunteers in the equine orthopaedic research program over the past 10 years; this allows students to develop a high level of research expertise during 2017-18 REPORT 69PROGRAM SYNOPSIS this undergraduate experience. This involvement encourages students to pursue advanced degrees and ultimately research careers rather than traditional private veterinary practice. Our program also impacts under-graduate and pre-veterinary education by applying findings from research studies to clinical vet- erinary medicine. The breadth of dissemination of information from the Orthopaedic Research Center is extensive, with infor- mation distributed to graduate and undergraduate students in eight Departments within five Colleges at Colorado State University. Many faculty members from these five Colleges who are participants in the Ortho- paedic Research Program are internationally recog- nized; they are therefore able to share research find- ings worldwide to academia, the equine industry, the scientific community, and private biomedical industry. The ORC's extensive collaboration with the Steadman Philippon Research Institute and biotechnology com- panies, as well as collaboration in five NIH research grants, has significantly impacted the treatment of humans with orthopaedic injuries and osteoarthritis. Human medicine, as well as veterinary medicine, has been positively affected by the dissemination of the ORC's findings.Potential Impact of Translational Medicine Institute Program Trends 1. Faculty and Staff: Over the last 12 years, funding for our orthopaedic research and specialized person- nel availability has increased dramatically. Until 1994, orthopaedic research was being performed by faculty members within the Department of Clinical Sciences. Since that time, the ORC research involves fourteen full-time faculty members (including three Bioengi- neering Faculty) in our Center. To support the work of the Faculty Researchers, we now have eight research associates. We had ten Ph.D. students in the program in 2018. Current funding is around $4 million annually. 2. Facilities: Thanks to generous private donors, the construction of the Gail Holmes Equine Orthopaedic Research Center and the remodeling of the ortho- paedic research laboratories was completed 16 years ago. In addition, a state-of-the-art equine MRI facility has been in operation for 12 years, and this was also funded by private donations. More recently, a state- of-the-art gait analysis facility has been added and the roof of the ORC Laboratories has been replaced 70 ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH CENTERPROGRAM SYNOPSIS as a gabled roof, and with additional renovations to accommodate expansion of Bioengineering. Last but not least, the new Translational Medicine Institute (TMI) is allowing us to play a much larger role in translational research to people in addition to our animals. 3. Endowed chairs: We have also received three $3 million University Endowed Chairs from Barbara Cox Anthony, Iron Rose Ranch, and Abigail K. Kawanana- koa, a $1.5 million Chair in Musculoskeletal Imaging from the estate of Kenneth and Virginia Atkinson, and most recently, a $6 million Presidential Endowed Chair from John and Leslie Malone. We continue to pursue endowed funding to make all of our positions perma- nent. 4. Further development of the Equine Ambulatory Sports Medicine Service: An equine ambulatory sports medicine service was initiated in 2010, and has now grown to where Drs. Chris Kawcak and Melissa King have been joined by Dr. Mindy Story, Dr. Erin Contino and Dr. Katie Seabaugh. There are now three research associates, Lindsey McCormick, Whitney McMillan, and Meredith Park assisting in this service offering state-of-the-art expertise in equine musculo- skeletal problems in athletic horses. Britt Mactavish is the Equine Operations Manager of the program. We have three equine sports medicine residents (one in each year) and have graduated our seventh resident from their three-year program in 2018. The service commenced in 2011 and has continued to exceed our expectations in demand.5. Establishment of Equine Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation Residencies: A new American veter- inary specialty, the American College of Veterinary Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation was accredited by the American Veterinary Medical Association in May 2009. There were 27 Charter Diplomates established by a nomination and Delphi election system. Four of our faculty, Drs. McIlwraith, Haussler, Kawcak, and Fris- bie, were made Charter Diplomates of the new Col- lege. We then established an equine sports medicine and rehabilitation residency program to train future specialists in 2010. Our first resident, Dr. Dora Ferris commenced in July 2010 followed by our second resi- dent, Dr. Erin Contino starting in July 2011, and our third resident Dr. Josh Donnell started in July 2012. These first three residents had their credentials accepted and passed the examination to be-come board cer- tified as Diplomates of the American College of Vet- erinary Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation. Drs. Ferris and Donnell have gone into private practice and Dr. Erin Contino is a faculty member in our Equine Sports Medicine Service. 6. Unrestricted Funding from Donors and Founda- tions: The period 2017-2018 has been one of continu- ing to function with good support and further increase in faculty and staff positions. Donor support is critical to our continued operation and growth. The funding and building of the TMI in this time period is a partic- ular highlight. 2017-18 REPORT 71RESEARCH TECHNIQUES AVAILABLE AT THE ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH CENTER 1.

Take home message Arterial oxygen decreases in both spontaneously breathing and ventilated horses after a change in lateral recumbency. In healthy horses, this improves over time. Introduction There was an opportunity to partner to assess arte- rial oxygenation amongst other variables during a year-long project in which horses were anesthetized repeatedly and where a change in position from one to the other lateral recumbency was necessary to fa- cilitate data collection. Uniquely these horses were anesthetized at an elevation of approximately 1525 m above sea level. Methods The study was completed in 8 healthy horses. Hors- es underwent multiple anesthesias during which they were positioned in either right or left lateral recumbency for computed tomography. Physiologi- cal parameters (e.g., blood pressure) were assessed during anesthesia maintenance with isoflurane. Breathing was spontaneous or controlled. Blood was sampled from an arterial catheter prior to, with- in 5 min of changing lateral recumbency and prior to circuit disconnection for measurement of pH, blood gases and laboratory analytes. Results The oxygen tension decreased after turning and then increased to prior to disconnection regardless of the starting lateral recumbency. The oxygen prior to disconnection was however lower than pre turn- ing. As anticipated, there were differences in carbon dioxide tensions and pH between spontaneously breathing and ventilated horses. Changes over time in electrolytes and blood glucose and lactate while evident were minor. Conclusions This study provides baseline blood gas and elec- trolyte values in horses anesthetized at an altitude of approximately 1525 m. Results confirm results obtained at sea-level that changing lateral recum- bency during anesthesia decreases blood oxygen tension and hence caution is advised especially in animals with pre-existing hypoxemia. 100 ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH CENTERRESEARCH | FOCUS 1 - Musculoskeletal Tissue Healing Take home message This article summarizes the innovative approaches being used to engineer tissue through use of inject- able hydrogels for cartilage repair. Currently, many young adults are commonly receiving cartilage res- toration procedures but these procedures are built for relief rather than a cure. Further investigation into tissue engineering, specifically injectable hy- drogels, shows they are an adequate substitute that restores, maintains, and improves tissue functions. Introduction Injectable hydrogels have received increased atten- tion for the treatment of articular cartilage. It has a wide range of properties including retaining a large amount of water, allowing it to have an excellent permeability for nutrients and metabolites as well has being very compatible for the body. Cells and bioactive molecules are also easily added into the hydrogels. It further allows the ability to provide cues for cell differentiation. The procedure of inject- ing hydrogels is also minimally invasive. The objective of this article is to present informa- tion on the use of bio-compatible hydrogels within cartilage regenerative procedures that should be considered as a potential solution to the limited ef- fectiveness of current methods of treating cartilage degenerative diseases. Methods A comprehensive look at the literature on the phys- ical and biochemical properties of hydrogels, the biological properties of the cellular components of the system, and the current best practices in treat- ment (both approved and experimental) which were used to provide a complete picture of the current and past research on this topic.Results This thorough review of the literature and the stud- ies previously conducted on this mode of treatment shows there is conclusive research indicating that, while there is a limited sample size for clinical ap- plications, the scientific community should continue to look into this method of treatment. Through in situ and in vivo studies, it has been shown that hy- drogels provide an environment which promotes re- cruitment of cells and regrowth of cartilage. The liter- ature currently shows that this can be done through either placement of stem-cell-recruiting cytokines (such as SDF-1, IL-8, PDGFs or cells (ACIs, ESCs, MSCs, or iPSCs) within the system. Additionally, physical tests have been done which show that hydrogels adequately mimic the physiological properties of healthy carti- lage - something which is a beneficial attribute as it serves as a symptomatic relief as the cartilage is regenerating. Lastly, the literature indicates that the clinical studies which have been performed, while limited at time of publication, show that the hydrogel system is beneficial in improved regeneration when compared to current best practices. Conclusion By using injectable hydrogels, there is improved control over in situ gelation, new processing tech- niques for the hydrogels (e.g. like being able to make multiple layers), and better incorporation of biological signals. Multiple studies on animal mod- els evaluating cartilage repair with hydrogels have shown promising results in osteochondral defects. There is limited experience with human patients, but blinded randomized controlled trials will further de- termine the effectiveness of hydrogels in cartilage repair.Current and novel injectable hydrogels to treat focal chondral lesions: properties and applicability This is a summary of an article by Drs.

We have provided evidence that an ex vivo transduction technique, employed with a screening process, produces detectable levels of BMP-2. Introduction Conventional clinical management of segmented bone defects in humans continues to result in 5-10% of fractures forming non-unions, meaning it is nec- essary to search for new innovative approaches to bone repair. In parallel, fracture repair in the horse and the difficult recovery is a major challenge be- cause of chronic pain, the development of support limb laminitis, and association with ischemia and infection, which can result in euthanasia of the pa- tient. Further, because of the challenges associated with fracture repair in the horse, and parallels be- tween poor soft tissue coverage and blood supply to the distal limb of horses and the limbs of humans, a translational incentive exists such that success in the equine model may help heal the 5-10% of human fractures that do not heal despite clinical interven- tion. Mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone mar- row aspirates (BMDMSCs) are often combined with growth factors to induce bone formation and accel- erate healing. The most prominently studied oste- oinductive growth factor in bone healing is bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2). Recombinant BMP-2 (rhBMP-2) has met with varying clinical suc- cess and has well documented limitations. Gene therapy is considered an alternative to recombinant protein therapy. BMDMSCs can be genetically mod- ified to produce therapeutic proteins in quantities that affect clinical outcomes in bone. Self-comple- mentary adeno associated virus (scAAV) is a vector designed such that therapeutic protein production begins within hours of transduction. It has also been shown to selectively transduce target BMDMSCs and produce high levels of therapeutic proteins even in BMDMSCs with low proliferations rates. The objectives of this study were to evaluate scAAV- BMP-2 osteogenic induction in equine BMDMSCs in vitro and to investigate if selective cryopreservation of scAAV-BMP-2 cells would not reduce the BMP- 2 delivery capacity of the genetically modified cells following recovery in vitro. Methods Mesenchymal progenitor cells from five skeletal- ly mature horses were isolated aseptically from the sternum. The cells were transduced in serum free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Media containing 48,000 viral particles per cell (vpc) scAAV-equine- BMP-2 or 8,000 vpc scAAV-GMP for three hours. Cells in non-vector control groups were incubated in incomplete media during this time. BMP-2 pro- tein expression was evaluated on days 7 and 14. Morphology was graded on days 7 and 14 as well. The two horses producing the most BMP-2 protein expression were selected to undergo cryopreserva- tion studies. The cells were transduced and cryo- preserved for 48 hours and later, the viability of the cells were assessed. Results The genetically modified scAAV-equine-BMP-2 cells produced significantly more protein than any other group. Cells treated with rhBMP-2 produced similar amounts of BMP-2 protein as scAAV-equine-BMP-2 genetically modified cells, as expected. However, following cryopreservation, scAAV-equine-BMP-2 Genetic modification of scAAV-equine-BMP-2 transduced bone- cells before and after cryopreservation: an \"off-the-shelf\" option for fracture repair This is a summary of an article by Drs. A.N. Ball, of Orthopedic Research.\u00b9 2017-18 REPORT 103RESEARCH | FOCUS 1 - Musculoskeletal Tissue Healing cells produced less BMP-2 protein when compared to transduced cells that were not cryopreserved but the change in this small sample size was not sig- nificant. In addition, cryopreserved rhBMP-2 treated cells produced similar amounts of BMP-2 protein when compared to non-cryopreserved cells. Conclusion This is the first evidence that cryopreservation of genetically modified BMDMSCs would not alter os- teoinductive potential or clinical use of allogeneic donor cells in cases of equine fracture repair. Fur- ther work remains to be done to establish the ther- apeutic effectiveness of BMP-2 genetically modified allogeneic cells in clinical cases of fracture repair, and use of an equine pre-clinical model, translation- al to humans, should be performed to establish ther- apeutic effectiveness in vivo. after cryopreservation: an \"off-the- shelf\" option for fracture repair.

We have developed a direct fit- ting method using a stress history variable which is unlimited in the loading profile and improves both fitting efficiency and computational tractability. Introduction Compelling evidence that many biological soft tis- sues display both strain- and time-dependent be- havior has led to the development of fully non-lin- ear viscoelastic modeling techniques to represent the tissue's mechanical response under dynamic conditions. Since the current stress state of a visco- elastic material is dependent on all previous loading events, numerical analyses are complicated by the requirement of computing and storing the stress at each step throughout the load history. This require- ment quickly becomes computationally expensive, and in some cases intractable, for finite element models. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a strain-dependent numerical integration approach for capturing non-linear viscoelasticity that enables calculation of the current stress from a strain-dependent history state variable stored from the preceding time step only. Methods This work expanded upon a previously developed comprehensive viscoelastic characterization for modeling nonlinear viscoelasticity in which the time-dependent behavior is approximated by a dis- crete Prony series [1,2,3]. While this method requires a multi-step approach and a pre-defined strain his- tory, the novel direct fit method developed in this study uses a strain-dependent history variable that is defined to recursively update the stress at each incremental time step. This allows a direct fit using any arbitrary strain history. This methodology was validated based on its ability to recover non-linear viscoelastic coefficients from simulated stress-re- laxation (six strain levels) and dynamic cyclic (three frequencies) experimental stress-strain data. Results The simulated stress relaxation and cyclic data were fitted using the direct fit method to both a nonlinear and a linear viscoelastic model. The nonlinear mod- el successfully fit each data set with average errors in recovered coefficients of 0.3% for stress-relax- ation fits and 0.1% for cyclic (Figure 1). In contrast, the linear model was unable to capture the strain-de- pendent stress-relaxation data (Figure 2). Conclusions The results support the use of the presented direct fit methodology to develop linear or non-linear vis- coelastic models from stress-relaxation or cyclic experimental data. The contrast between nonlin- ear and linear viscoelastic fits supports the use of nonlinear modeling for characterizing biological soft tissues.The development and validation of a numerical integration method for non-linear viscoelastic modeling This is a summary of an article by Drs.

Biomarkers might also predict pre-fracture change that could lead to catastrophic bone failure in equine athletes. The workshop was attended by leading scientists in the fields of equine and human musculoskeletal biomarkers to enable cross-disciplinary exchange and improve knowl- edge in both. Detailed proceedings with strategic planning was written, added to, edited and refer- enced to develop this manuscript. The most recent information from work in equine and human osteo- arthritic biomarkers was accumulated, including the use of personalized healthcare to stratify OA phe- notypes, transcriptome analysis of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and meniscal injuries in the human knee. The spectrum of \"wet\" biomarker assays that are antibody based that have achieved usefulness in both humans and horses, imaging biomarkers and the role they can play in equine and human OA was discussed. Prediction of musculoskeletal injury in the horse remains a challenge, and the potential usefulness of spectroscopy, metabolomics, pro- teomics, and development of biobanks to classify biomarkers in different stages of equine and human OA were reviewed. The participants concluded that new information and studies in equine musculoskel- etal biomarkers have potential translational value for humans and vice versa. OA is equally important in humans and horses, and the welfare issues as- sociated with catastrophic musculoskeletal injury in horses add further emphasis to the need for good validated biomarkers in the horse. Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common disease affecting the joints in humans and is an important cause of pain, disability, and economic loss.1-3 Trau- matic joint injury and OA are equally important in the equine athlete,4 not only for joint disease but also for bone failure. In September 2014, the third Dorothy Russell Havemeyer Foundation Symposia on Equine Musculoskeletal Bio-markers was held (the second Havemeyer Foundation Symposium has been re- ported5). The aim was to identify validated biomark - ers that could be used to complement clinical ob- servations for diagnosis and prognosis of joint injury leading to OA, to predict pre-fracture subchondral bone disease which can lead to catastrophic bone failure in equine athletes, and to discuss develop- ment of a point of care diagnostic platform. The definition of a biomarker varies but a recent consensus suggests it is \"a characteristic that is ob- jectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biologic processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic inter- vention.\"6 Further, this definition stated that \"bio- markers can be anatomic, physiologic, biochemi- cal, or molecular parameters associated with the presence and severity of specific diseases and are detectable by a variety of methods including phys- ical examination, laboratory assays, and imaging.\" Biomarkers have been into \"dry\" (e.g., imaging parameters) and \"wet\" biomarkers (genet- ic and biochemical entities that can be detected in blood, serum, urine, synovial fluid [SF], and tissues) in OA.7 There has been much work in biomarkers in OA in humans for over 25 years.8,9 The quest is still on- going to define a validated and qualified biomarker panel that could be used to complement clinical ob- servations for diagnosis, prognosis and response to treatment, with the most recent data from the NIH Osteoarthritis Initiative reported.10 The first report Biomarkers for equine joint injury and osteoarthritis The article below represents the results of a symposium aimed at identifying valid data biomarkers that can be used to complement clinical observations for diagnosis and prognosis of joint injury leading to osteoarthritis (OA).

The current narrative review represents the key findings from the presentations by the attendees, the issues and questions arising from their discussion and the for- mal break-out sessions held at the 2014 Symposia. Equine musculoskeletal biomarkers: current knowledge and future needs Previous studies have promoted development of targeted molecular diagnostics and predictive bio- markers as models for personalized equine ortho- pedic medicine.5,14,15 Diagnostics are sought that are non-invasive, repeatable/reproducible and have specificity and sensitivity for early stages of OA.16 Spontaneous joint disease is a common clin- ical problem in the horse and surveys estimate that up to 60% of lameness is related to OA.17 There is therefore a need for diagnostics designed to predict risk of clinical injury and not just manage the extent of OA, bone disease, catastrophic fracture, and ten- don/ligament injury, but to monitor the health and training of competition horses and prevent such in- juries. This workshop focused on the current status of diagnostic and point of care platforms for predic- tive biomarkers. Biomarkers in human OA: current state of the art in osteoarthritis biomarkers There is an urgent need for qualified biomarkers to monitor OA development, predict the long-term clin- ical treatment response and outcome, and identify individuals with the highest risk of disease progres- sion.7,9,16,18 Osteoarthritis biomarkers could assist clin- ical trials by delivering essential early information of treatment response, speeding up compound evalu- ation, and thereby making OA a more manageable target for new drug development. Since a disease starts when detected by the best marker available to define it, herein lies the power of biomarkers. This is especially important for OA, a disease with a prolonged asymptomatic molecular and pre-radio- graphic phase. Biomarkers could provide an early warning of biochemical and structural alterations leading to earlier treatment prior to irreversible dis- ease, which is likely recalcitrant to therapy. An Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) White Paper7 was produced in response to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) call for a critical appraisal of fundamentals of the science related to biomarkers of OA, particularly relating to drug development. A subsequent OARSI White Paper reviewed FDA guidance on biomarkers and made recommendations for their use in preclinical development and phase I to IV clinical trials.18 These documents catalyzed the OA Biomarker Consortium study managed by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH)10 and highlight how ad- vances in the field of OA research and treatments can be accelerated by a systematic paradigm that encompasses development, validation, qualifica- tion, and regulatory approval of OA-related biomark - ers for clinical trial and clinical use (also see http:// oarsi.org). In addition to robust disease definitions, there is a recognized need for a consensus on a nomencla- ture defining the disease. According to the FDA19 the \"currently used disease classification systems define diseases primarily on the basis of their signs and symptoms.\" Consequently, many disease sub- types with distinct molecular causes are still classi- fied as one entity, with little ability to stratify or link distinct phenotypes. The National Academy of Sci- ences has called for a \"New Taxonomy\" of disease to advance our understanding of disease pathogen- esis and improve health, that defines and describes diseases on the basis of their intrinsic biology in ad- dition to traditional signs and symptoms.20 Biomark - ers are key to this new taxonomy for heterogeneous diseases such as OA. To aid in this, a standardized nomenclature has been proposed, describing dis- ease (molecular, anatomic, and physiological as- pects) and illness aspects of OA.21RESEARCH | FOCUS 2 - Early Diagnosis of Bone and Joint Disease 108 ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH CENTERUse of personalized health care (PHC) to stratify OA phenotypes OA is a heterogeneous disorder, with numerous drivers of disease progression. However, up to 50% of OA patients in clinical studies and approximate- ly 85% in the background population do not show both symptom and structural progression over 2 years.22,23 It is therefore important to identify the in- dividuals that progress and determine the drivers of progression. This would enable enriching of clini- cal trial populations, and when effective treatment is available to slow disease progression, to identify those in need of it. There is a need to pair the para- mount risk factor for progression with personalized treatment approaches, in which \"one size does not fit all.\" A number of drivers for PHC in OA have been identified24: (i) Identification of patients who respond optimally, with the highest efficacy and lowest safe- ty concerns, to a given treatment; (ii) Specific de- velopment strategy for a selected subpopulation of patients; and (iii) Efficient use of healthcare re- sources. To date, three different OA subpopulations have been identified: (i) Inflammation mediated OA; (ii) Subchondral bone turnover driven OA; and (iii) Trauma driven OA. Biomarkers can identify different pathophysiological processes potentially leading to identification of these phenotypes (Figure 1 [from Lotz et al.24,25]).Transcriptome analyses of meniscus and anterior cruciate ligament injuries may provide insights into early OA These were novel discovery studies seeking to determine signaling pathways and specifically ex- pressed transcripts that are different between sam- ples. As with most transcriptomic profiling studies, these investigations are usually undertaken as \"hy- pothesis-free\" discovery studies, and do not rely on previous investigations to develop preliminary hypotheses. Clinical studies of athletes and revision anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction pa- tients indicate that having a partial meniscectomy, increasing age and elevated BMI are all associated with degenerative changes in knee articular carti- lage. Englund et al. have suggested that weaken- ing of the meniscus due to processes similar to OA may be sentinel for the disease.26 However, little is known about the molecular signatures in injured meniscus. An extensive analysis of gene expression from meniscal fragments recovered from meniscal repair surgery was evaluated for association with the presence or absence of a concomitant ACL in- jury, age, BMI, and articular cartilage disease in the patient.27-30 Transcripts associated with extracel- lular matrix (ECM) synthesis were down regulated in obese individuals (BMI >30) perhaps indicating a higher risk of developing meniscus degenera- tion. Transcripts upregulated in obese compared to lean or overweight patients were associated with increased apoptosis and suppression of ECM deposition. Patients >40 years of age demonstrat- ed repression of genes for skeletal development, cartilage development, and cartilage ECM synthe- sis and elevation of genes involved in cell cycle and cell division, immune response, and inflamma- tion pathways. Results such as these may provide a molecular rationale for the known clinical effects of partial meniscectomy, increasing age, and increas- ing obesity on the development of cartilage degen- eration.31-33 Further investigation of the relative gene expres- sion levels in the ACL at various times after inju- ry from acute (<3 months) to chronic (>12 months) showed that processes representing angiogenesis were repressed in acute tears. In intermediate tears, processes representing stem cell proliferation con-RESEARCH | FOCUS 2 - Early Diagnosis of Bone and Joint Disease Figure 1.

In chronic tears, processes denoting myo- sin filament organization were elevated while those representing cellular component organization and ECM organization were repressed. An ACL tear ap- pears to stimulate local repair processes early after rupture that recede over time. Further transcriptome analysis of injured and OA joint tissues may provide candidates for molecular biomarkers as well as tar- gets for treatment that would reduce the risk of de- veloping OA.29,32,33 Fluid (\"wet\") biomarker Biomarker assessment by immunologic assay has been the standard for analysis in both humans and horses (reviewed recently).14,15 Progress continues with development of biomarkers for human OA and their use in clinical trials7,16,18 and knowledge has ad- vanced in parallel in the horse (Table S1, see page 120).5,15 Studies in the horse have shown significant exercise related changes in serum biomarkers of collagen metabolism in young horses.33 Equine se- rum markers have also been shown to distinguish changes associated with exercise from pathologic change in exercising horses, and to correlate to clin- ical parameters of pain in an equine OA model.12 A clinical study in 238 racehorses, employing monthly musculoskeletal examinations and blood samples, showed that it was possible to correctly predict horses that would sustain an injury 74% of the time.34 Recent work evaluating proteinases has shown that: (i) the presence of lumican and a 29 kD lumican catabolite increased with the onset and progression of OA;35,36 (ii) a splice variant of one of the aggreca- nases (ADAMTS4) was identified that appears to be specifically synthesized by human OA synovium and is associated with aggrecan degradation in the su- perficial zone of articular cartilage;37 and (iii) synovial fluid ADAMTS4 activity is a marker of inflammation and effusion.38 Such findings have biologic/disease rationale as confirmed by OA onset in a STR/ORT mouse model being significantly reduced using monoclonal antibodies directed against substrate recognition domains of ADAMTS5.39An anti-cathepsin K antibody has demonstrated sig- nificant involvement of K in equine OA alternate equine type II collagen specific cathepsin K cleavage site was identified in the N-ter- minal region of the C-terminal collagen fragment us- ing proteomic and immunological techniques.43 A novel ELISA assay (C2K77) has been developed to measure the activity of cathepsin K in culture media and is being validated in body fluids.44 While trauma is pivotal in the pathogenesis of hu- man knee OA, seemingly equivalent injuries do not invariably result in post-traumatic (ptOA). For in- stance, only 50% of patients with ACL rupture de- velop ptOA 10-15 years later, and these numbers are not substantially affected by surgical reconstruction and \"restoration\" of joint biomechanics.45-48 This suggests that factors other than joint instability may play a role in the risk, rate of onset, and progression of ptOA after injury. Differences between non-ptOA inducing (sham) and ptOA-inducing joint injury in mice showed differing phases of synovial inflamma- tion with distinct cyclically T-cell infiltration into the synovium without associated systemic change. Data from Jaf- fa mice (protected from cartilage damage) suggest that proteolysis of aggrecan by ADAMTS plays a critical role in regulating the inflammatory response in the joint, particularly in macrophage activation and M1/M2 polarization. As has been done in in- flammatory arthropathies, monitoring the pattern of cell influx into the joint after injury may be diagnos- tic and enable differentiation between OA-inducing and non-inducing joint trauma.49-51 Examination of proteins from harvested media in an interleukin-1 beta cartilage explant model analyzed by liquid chromatography mass tandem spectrom- etry (LC-MS/MS) identified cartilage oligomeric ma- trix protein (COMP) as a potential OA diagnostic in horses. The unique fragments of COMP include the amino acid sequences that form a new terminal (neo-epitope) sequence; polyclonal antibodies that react specifically with this new cleavage site have now been developed.52 It was concluded that an increase in the COMP neo-epitope in synovial flu- 110 ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH CENTERRESEARCH | FOCUS 2 - Early Diagnosis of Bone and Joint Disease id from horses with acute lameness suggested that this has the potential to be a unique candidate bio- marker for the early molecular changes in articular cartilage associated with OA. Imaging biomarkers in the horse Imaging lacks evidence as a biomarker technique for predicting and characterizing musculoskeletal injuries, especially to inform prognosis. Hurdles include limited ability to discern normal tissue ad- aptation from early disease, limited use of frontline volumetric imaging techniques (usually due to cost), lack of prospective data on imaging biomarkers in relation to disease presence and outcome in the horse, modest correlation between pain and im- aging results, and limited follow-up/longitudinal imaging.13,53 However, progress is being made and novel techniques including digital radiography, ul- trasound, nuclear scintigraphy, computed tomogra- phy (CT) and developing. The use of digital radiography, nuclear scintigraphy, CT, and MRI to distinguish changes with exercise versus OA has been published.13 Digital radiography technology allows image ma- nipulation to improve lesion detection but a 30- 40% change in bone mineral density is still need- ed to detect lesions, allowing for significant tissue changes to occur prior to detection.54 Radiological changes in OA are slow to develop, and thereby inhibit intervention in a timely fashion. Joint space width has been used for decades as a measure of joint disease severity, yet it lacks predictive ability for clinical outcomes in humans.55 Joint space width measurements in equine femorotibial joints have recently been assessed for accuracy and standard- ization of positioning, as in humans, is essential for maximum accuracy.56 Radiography, however, contin- ues to be a useful outcome measure in a common model of OA.13 Nuclear scintigraphy has been useful in defining the presence of disease compared to increased uptake that occurs with exercise alone in horses.57 Although nuclear scintigraphy appears helpful in early diag- nosis of disease, it lacks the specificity to fully de- fine the lesion, but may be useful for screening and monitoring OA onset or progression in both horses and humans. Computed tomography has been used clinically to detect occult lesions in subchondral bone. Detec- tion of sity by computed tomographic osteoabsorptiome- try (CTO) has been used to define joint disease in horses.13 It appears that CTO density patterns can characterize insidious disease processes, such as palmar osteochondral disease. Intra-articular ap- plication of contrast has also been used and pro- vides critical information concerning soft tissues of joints,58 especially those such as the equine femo- rotibial joint that can rarely be imaged using MRI.59 Dual energy CT has also been studied and appears to have value in characterization of soft tissues and detection of bone marrow edema.60 MRI has revolutionized the detection of subtle joint disease in all species, and in particular, the detection of soft tissue and articular lesions. However, its res- olution is limited and subtle bone and joint lesions can sometimes be missed.61 MRI has significant po- tential as a predictive marker of disease as shown by many studies including the MRI component of the OARSI/FNIH study.61 A recent review has shown that measures of quantitative cartilage morphology, car- tilage defect and bone marrow lesions, bone shape and attrition, and subchondral bone area were the most promising as imaging biomarkers.62 Quantitative MR imaging has improved character- ization of articular cartilage matrix (GAG, collagen, and water) in humans and research animals, with limited use in the horse. dGEMRIC imaging uses intraarticular or IV administration of gadolinium based contrast medium measured in relation to the fixed-charged matrix components, giving an indica- tion of GAG concentration in the cartilage matrix.63 T1rho has been used in people but not horses, and can give information on GAG content, but can also be influenced by collagen content.64 Therefore T2 mapping is often necessary for comparison. Sodium MR imaging is also correlated to GAG, but requires special equipment and high field strength for scan- ning.65 T2 and T2 imaging can be used to charac- 2017-18 REPORT 111RESEARCH | FOCUS 2 - Early Diagnosis of Bone and Joint Disease terize collagen content within articular cartilage, but often require long scan times.66 Diffusion weighted techniques measure water diffusion through the ma- trix and appear to have promise in best characteriz- ing matrix integrity.67 Standing low-field MRI systems have been useful in the horse for identifying osseous pathology, which appears to carry various (but ill-defined) risks of sus- taining catastrophic injury,68,69 but their usefulness is limited to the distal limb; because of low quality resolution only rudimentary visualization of the artic- ular cartilage is possible limiting early identification of cartilage pathology. All imaging modalities to date focus on identifying tissue changes after the initiating insult. Much like genetic markers, using biomechanical modeling to identify those horses with joints that may be geo- metrically predisposed to disease has potential uses for identifying risk and modulating exercise to lower risk and/or severity of disease.70 The use of spectroscopy as a biomarker In the case of naturally occurring equine traumat- ic OA, the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) approach has been confirmed as highly ac- curate for synovial fluid when compared to arthros- copy.71 The limitations of such studies are that they have been conducted on clinically apparent cases and have not been tested in a preclinical population of horses for which prospective synovial fluid analy- sis would be impractical.35 One of the significant advantages of FTIR as a bio- marker tool is that the spectra generated from se- rum or any other body fluid, encompass not only known markers but also unknown markers.71 Current work has used transmission FTIR that is expensive but more cost-effective clinical platforms are being developed.72 Metabolomics and proteomics There has been increasing interest in profiling the metabolome, consisting of the low molecular weight end products of cell metabolic processes which in- dicate the cellular function of a given cell type or tis- sue under specific conditions.73,74 The principal an-alytical techniques used in metabolomics are mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.75 Compared to MS, NMR spec- troscopy is non-destructive and requires little sam- ple preparation, and can generate a comprehensive metabolomics profile from intact bio-fluids and tis- sues.76 However, in certain instances this technique is insufficient to provide information that will fully characterize a metabolite and MS analysis has the advantage of higher sensitivity. In OA, metabolomic fingerprinting has been per- formed on urine samples from Hartley guinea-pigs which spontaneously develop OA.77,78 MS-based proteomics techniques have also been used to determine the underlying mechanisms of musculo- skeletal aging, OA and tendon injury in equine SF from normal and OA racing Thoroughbreds as well as equine cartilage and tendon from normal or dis- eased young and old donors (Table S1, see page 120). Proteomic analysis of the OA cartilage secretome identifies molecules with roles in the pathologic processes and allows the global study of secreted proteins while also potentially enabling biomarker discovery. In one study an equine degradome using a mass spectrometry-based absolute quantification method using a concatamer of selected quantotypic peptides representative of proteins (QconCAT) was designed to measure specific cleaved ECM pro- teins.79 There was a significant decrease with age of the mean concentration of aggrecan G3 that is ex- plained by loss of G3 soon after cartilage aggrecan synthesis and a steady decline in turnover produc- ing a loss of G3 in the resident aggrecan molecules. The result is that the average size of aggrecan de- creases with age, and a large proportion of aggre- can lacks a G3 domain.80 Matrix assisted laser desorption ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS) was used to exam- ine proteins in situ at high spatial resolution in an examination of full-thickness equine cartilage slices; identified ECM proteins included COMP, fibromod- ulin, biglycan, and type II collagen. In addition, a number of OA and age specific markers were iden- tified.81 112 ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH CENTERRESEARCH | FOCUS 2 - Early Diagnosis of Bone and Joint Disease Proteomic profiling of equine synovial fluid from normal and OA metacarpophalangeal joints using label-free quantification approaches following pro- tein equalization techniques identified 754 proteins in synovial fluid, 593 with a significant Mascot score. Proteins identified included those relating to matrix proteins, inflammatory factors, complement activa- tion proteins and proteases. A subset of 10 proteins were identified which were differentially expressed in OA synovial fluid. This distinct set of proteins could provide potential biomarkers to stratify OA.82 Although frequently used in clinical research, sub- stantial challenges remain before this technology can be employed as a biomarker in a clinical setting. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) and a computational strategy to support biomarker and therapeutic discovery With NGS approaches, it is possible to identify sub- tle unique genomic variations encoded in each in- dividual's genome and identify the transcriptionally active genes in individual tissues. This provides the ability to explore associated differences in coding or transcriptional activity with clinical observations, ultimately affording cause-effect relationships that impact aspects of the individual's health status. Knowledge of the extent of an individual's unique genomic variation, which genes are transcriptionally active and the pathway assignments of each gene provides information about the metabolically active processes and how the host's tissues metabolic ac- tivity differs after injury compared to a healthy state. Further, this global approach holds the promise to not only discern early pre-symptomatic disease, but also identify susceptible individuals. In addition to global post-genomic experimental techniques, powerful analytical strategies are re- quired to fully utilize the resulting large and complex data-sets. To address this need, iterative feature removal (IFR) analysis was developed to identify molecular features that can be used as classifiers for metabolic activity and as diagnostics.83 The IFR process works by repeatedly building a predictive model on training data using a classifier that as- signs non-zero weights to only a minimal subset of non-redundant features. IFR assists investigators with process discovery in a way that alternative feature selection approaches cannot. IFR analysis, when applied to global biological data-sets, allows for more comprehensive evaluation of linked met- abolic processes. When applied to transcriptional data, IFR identified sets of genes that were highly predictive even when the sets were comprised of genes that, taken individually, appeared non-dis- criminatory. The efforts here not only identify bio- markers that are classifiers for disease, but also pro- vide biomarkers that hold the potential to screen for disease susceptibility. Due to the global analysis offered by NGS, this strat- egy can also be used to identify pathways associat- ed with therapeutic intervention and healing. Based on observations that IGF-I could function as an ana- bolic factor for the treatment of OA, a gene therapy approach was taken to produce IGF-I and NGS was used to map the biological response associated with the observed healing effects in an equine study.84 Analysis of the resulting transcriptional response to IGF-I therapy revealed that genes and metabol- ic pathways associated with specific extracellular matrix collagen types were differentially regulated, as in cartilage development and chondrocyte dif- ferentiation. NGS analysis afforded a differential ex- pression fingerprint that could potentially be used to monitor treatments of OA. Biobanks to classify biomarkers in different stages of equine OA In order to validate existing and develop new wet biomarkers it is critical that sufficient well-docu- mented equine samples are available to the re- search community. Potential biomarkers can be tested using standard samples from biobanks and classified according to: Burden of disease (B), Inves- tigative (I), Prognosis (P), and Efficacy of treatment (E), Diagnostic (D), and Safety (S) (BIPEDS).85 Safety was added in a second OARSI White Paper.18 Four equine biobanks are actively archiving specimens or are proposed: 1. Young horses sampled every third month during a training program with speed training gradually increasing during the study period. This biobank can test potential biomarkers for D (acute lameness) and P (initiation and pro- gression). 2017-18 REPORT 113RESEARCH | FOCUS 2 - Early Diagnosis of Bone and Joint Disease 2. Joints, sampled at one abattoir or necropsy. The articular cartilage should be characterized as being macroscopically normal or with mild, moderate, or severe lesions. Radiographic examination of the dissected bones should be included categorizing the bone according to the extent of sclerosis. These structural OA joints can be used for testing biomarkers as B (degree of structural OA) and D (Structural OA). 3. Horses in conventional training/racing and undergoing arthroscopy of different joints. The SF is aspirated during arthroscopy, and material from synovial membrane, synovial capsule and osteochondral fragment, when appropriate, is immersed in buffered formalin. 4. Clinically lame horses examined by routine lameness examination sometimes including the lameness locator test,86 evaluating acute and chronic lameness before and after local anesthesia. These fluids can test biomarkers for clinical OA as P (prognosis), E (efficacy), and D (diagnosis). These biobanks will consist of serum and synovial fluid (SF), and where possible tissues from synovial membrane/capsule and articular cartilage (including subchondral bone). Samples of the SF would be an- alyzed for total protein (g/L) and total number of leu- cocytes, and the remainder centrifuged for 20 min, 16,000g and aliquots' (100 m/L) frozen at 80\u00b0C and stored until analyzed. Signed ethical approvals and consent of the owners is mandatory for all samples. Conclusions New information and studies in equine musculo- skeletal biomarkers have potential translational value for humans and vice versa. Osteoarthritis is equally important in both humans and horses and the welfare issues associated with catastrophic musculoskeletal injury in horses add further em- phasis to the need for good validated biomarkers in the horse. Further progress in identifying useful human and equine biomarkers requires exploratory studies to identify promising candidates combined with the development of reliable assays. To prove clinical utility and acquire regulatory approval for a biomarker is a demanding task, requiring retrospec-tive hypothesis-generating and prospective hypoth- esis-testing studies in several study populations. The equine athlete offers a unique \"at risk\" popu- lation with a high incidence of naturally occurring clinically important musculoskeletal disease includ- ing OA, that is ideal for the discovery and validation of biomarkers across the BIPEDS spectrum. In addi- tion, by having established inducible models in the same species, the biomarkers can be used in devel- opment of new therapeutics which simultaneously validates their utility in monitoring disease progres- sion and response to treatment. To take advantage of this opportunity will require establishing stan- dardized methods of sample collection, reproduc- ible biomarker measurement, and well-documented biobanks akin to those in human medicine. Meeting these challenges will not be insubstantial, but the potential rewards for the equine industry and how this will inform human health, are enormous.

Elevated consistently with clinical and experimen- tal equine osteoarthritis as well as in response to phenylbutazone use.2,11,25 5D4 (specific KS epitope) Biomarker of GAG degradation but serum levels found not useful in cases of clinical osteochondral disease in horse.26 Another KS epitope-based ELISA in synovial acetonide.27 Osteocalcin (OC) bone assembly and turnover. Synovial fluid and serum OC showed significant increase with OA affected horses compared to non-OA affected horses.2 Decreases with exercise in non-OA horses in studies of clinical cases28 and that is expressed at high levels on the cell surface of the bone forming osteo- blasts and plays a role in bone formation. Correlation between synovial fluid levels and arthroscopically defined joint damage.28 Type I Collagen C-telopeptide fragments (CTX-1)Suggested as potentially useful for bone resorption and destruction but both serum and synovial fluid CTX-1 was not useful in separating early experimental OA from exercise alone2 but significantly increased in serum of foals with exercise (but then decreased after two months of training)30 and serum levels significantly increased in horses with experimental OA treated with extracorporeal shockwave therapy.31 Serum Amyloid A (SAA) The major acute-phase protein in horses and dramatic increases in synovial fluid and serum are seen during severe, acute as in LPS induced synovitis32,33 and septic arthritis.34 Useful in discriminating between infectious and non-infectious joint conditions but appears of little value in non-infected arthropathies including OA.35 Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) An arachidonic locally released into synovial fluid by inflamed synovial membrane and in lesser part by articular cartilage36 and has been used routinely to gauge inflammation level as well as effect of therapeutic agents reducing inflammation.37,38 PGE2 is one of the most useful treatment efficacy markers when investigating medications. PGE2 concentrations were significantly increased in synovial fluid in association with experimental equine OA2 compared to controls (exercised horses).Biomarkers for equine joint injury and osteoarthritis: supplemental table S1 and references cited 120 ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH CENTERName of biomarker Process measured and fluid evaluated (reference) Interleukin-1 (IL-1) Despite lack of a consistent association of synovial fluid IL-1beta levels with disease presence or severity, atten- uation of IL-1 induced changes in response to exogenous therapy is generally perceived as positive.39 IL-1beta increased progressively with clinical OA.40 Interleukin-6 (IL-6) Dramatic in synovial fluid IL-6 in with osteochondral lesions has been reported41 and sug- gested as an excellent predictor of OA compared to control horses.42 Synovial fluid IL-6 progressively increased in equine clinical arthritis. High Mobility Group Box Protein-1 (HMGB-1)This is a nuclear chaperoned protein, rapidly reduced in synovial fluid but not serum with onset of local joint inflammation43 and significantly higher synovial fluid concentrations found in 45 Thoroughbred racehorses with osteochondral injury compared with 40 sound controls.44 Preliminary value as a diagnostic or prognostic marker for OA. Tumor Necrosis Factor- alpha (TNF-alpha)Cytokine biomarker of inflammation increased progressively with progression of PTOA and correlated with radiographic progression of PTOA.44 (MMP)Activity assay. This assay detects only MMP-mediated substrate conversion and reflects the overall MMP activity in synovial fluid samples. There were significant increases in activity associated with moderate to severe cartilage damage (joints were examined postmortem).45 General MMP activity relative to control joints at 8 hours after single injections of reIL-1beta or LPS.46 Stromal Cell-Derived Factor-1 chondrocytes and serum SDF-1 concentrations were more sensitive than plasma and synovial fluid concentrations for detection of osteochondral injury in equine joints.47 Proteomics Comprehensive protein profiling of synovial fluid in equine osteoarthritis following protein equalization.

Oblique radiographic projec- tions of the tarsus may be useful for fracture iden- tification, but definitive diagnosis may require ad- vanced diagnostic imaging modalities such as CT and MRI. Horses with incomplete fracture of the ta- lus can successfully return to performance level with conservative management and treatment. Introduction A 6-year-old Quarter Horse gelding was evaluated for acute onset of non-weight-bearing lameness of the left hind limb following strenuous exercise, spe- cifically barrel-racing. The injury was characterized as acute development of non-weight bearing lame- ness (lameness score, 5/5) of the left hind limb 30 minutes after its fifth and final run during a competi- tion. The lameness rapidly improved with complete resolution within 1 hour after onset. Approximately 72 hours following the initial presentation of lame- ness, the horse again presented for non-weight bearing on the left hind limb. The veterinarian who evaluated the horse was unable to localize the source of the lameness during the physical exam- ination and did not perform a full lameness test due to the severity of the lameness. Due to unremark - able findings of manipulation and palpation of the limb, there was concern that the lameness originat- ed from the pelvic or proximal femoral region. The horse was referred to UCD VMTH for further eval- uation and received phenylbutazone (2g, IV) prior to transport to the teaching hospital. The horse was bright, alert, and responsive with appropriate vital parameters within reference limits upon physical ex- amination. The application of a hood tested to the left hind hoof elicited no response. There was noted mild symmetric effusion of the tarsocrural region bi- laterally. The horse allowed flexion, extension, and abduction of the left hind limb, but mildly resented adduction of the limb. Digital pulses of the right hind limb were mildly increased from normal, and a sup- port boot was applied to aid in prevention of lamini- tis in the left hind limb. Methods Nuclear scintigraphy was performed the day follow- ing initial examination at the teaching hospital. The horse was administered scintigraphy. The horse was sedated with detomidine hydrochloride (0.01 0.03 mg/kg [0.005 to 0.014 mg/lb], and [0.005 to 0.009 mg/ lb], IV) and positioned squarely on all 4 limbs; Full weight bearing position could not be achieved for the affected left hind limb. Lateral and plantar imag- es of the appendicular skeleton of both hind limbs, and dorsal and oblique images of the lumbar verte- brae and pelvis were obtained. Standard radiographic examination of the left tarsus was performed twenty-four hours after the nuclear scintigraphy evaluation. Radiographic projections obtained anesthesia of the left tarsocrural joint was performed to further understand abnormalities found during radiograph- ic and ultrasonographic examination that were not correlated with the nuclear scintigraphy results. Fol- lowing aseptic the left tarsal region, a 1.5-inch hypodermic needle was inserted into the dorsomedial pouch of the tarsocrural joint, Incomplete fracture of the talus secondary to maladaptive stress remodeling in a horse.

Hendrickson in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association. 2017-18 REPORT 125RESEARCH | FOCUS 2 - Early Diagnosis of Bone and Joint Disease and 20 mL of 2% mepivacaine hydrochloride was injected into the joint. A series of 3 intra-articular injections of ACS into the left tarsocrural joint with a 2-week interval between injections was prescribed. The dosing interval for the ACS was based the clinical experience of the attending clinician (SAK). It was recommended that the horse be stall-confined for 30 days with reeval- uation at 2-week intervals with a follow-up radio- graphic study of the left tarsus obtained at the end of the 30 day period. A physical examination and MRI were performed one week post-discharge to assess lameness and baseline movement. The horse was positioned in left lateral recumbency, and MRI of the left tarsus was performed with an intermediate-feld 1.0-T magnet.g T1 fast-spin echo, and short tau inversion recovery se- quences were obtained in the sagittal, dorsal, and transverse planes. Following the MRI, additional ra- diographs were obtained to further characterize the fracture. Results Nuclear scintigraphy revealed marked focal IRU in the proximal left talus. Mild diffuse IRU at the distal right tarsus was identified but considered an inci- dental finding (Figure 1). Radiographs included 2 approximately 1.5-cm-long, smoothly marginated, ovoid osseous fragments with 1 adjacent to dorsal medial malleolus and 1 distal to the the medial malleolus. Mild tarsocrural joint intracapsular swelling and a small focal concavity on the proximal aspect of the medial trochlear ridge of the talus were noted but were considered static compared to radiographs from 8 months prior. Ultrasonography revealed moderate desmitis of the short component of the medial collateral ligament origin and moderate tar- socrural joint effusion and synovitis. The 2 osseous on radiographs were associated with medial malleolar fractures. Left hind lameness (lameness score, im- proved one week post- initial examination MRI im- ages revealed an undulating fracture with irregular margins that extended across the talus. The fracture originated at the trochlear groove and extended in a dorsomedial direction into the medial trochlear ridge of the talus (Figure 2). Marked osseous scle- rosis coupled with an increase in the osseous fluid signal was present along the length of the fracture. A mild step defect associated with the fracture was Figure 1.

Notice the marked IRU within the tarsocrural region at the level of the talus. 126 ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH CENTERRESEARCH | FOCUS 2 - Early Diagnosis of Bone and Joint Disease detected at the dorsoproximal aspect of the medi- al trochlear ridge. A small round osseous fragment was identified embedded in the origin of the short component of the medial collateral ligament and was associated with thickening of the ligament at its origin.Additional radiographs of the left tarsus further char- acterized the fracture. The fracture is best visualized on a dorsal 20\u00b0 lateral-plantaromedial oblique pro- jection, as depicted by the black arrow (Figure 3). Conclusion Incomplete fractures of the talus are an important differential diagnosis for severe acute hind limb lameness following strenuous activity in equine patients. Standard radiographic evaluation of the tarsus, consisting of the minimum number of pro- jections, may be insufficient, thus it is essential to obtain additional oblique projections of the tarsus for proper diagnosis and to reduce the need for advanced diagnostic imaging modalities, such as CT and MRI. If properly identified, talus fractures in equine patients can be successfully managed with Figure 3.

Notice that the talus fracture (arrow) is evident.

Introduction Use of repository radiographs has not been includ- ed as standard practice as part of the sale process for Thoroughbred yearlings intended for racing. 2-3 common multiple studies 4-7 have been performed with the objective of examining the clinical impor- tance of pre-sale radiographic findings in Thorough- breds. Repository radiographs findings must be in- terpreted with consideration of the various breeds and athletic disciplines involved. 8 This paper was the second part of two studies initially evaluating the prevalence of radiographic lesions on reposito- ry radiographs 458 yearlings and 2-year-old quarter horses competing in cutting events. There was a fol- low up to see what the significance of these findings were. We hypothesize that many mild radiographic lesions would not be associated with reduced per- formance, whereas more severe lesions would be more likely to be clinically important. Methods Repository radiographs are obtained from the West- ern Bloodstock radiograph repository for horses of- fered at NCHA sales held between December 2005 and December 2006 and from a privately-owned cutting horse ranch as previously described. 9 Per- formance data was obtained through a review of performance record from the NCHA database and through the use of mail questionnaires and tele- phone calls to owners. Lesions of the tarsal joint - The lateromedial, dor- soplantar, dorsolateral-plantaromedial oblique, and dorsomedial-plantarolateral oblique views examined portions of the tarsal joint and for malformation of the central and third tarsal bones. The presence of osteophytes was graded from 0 to 4, corresponding to none, very small, small, me- dium, and large. Subchondral lysis was also graded on a scale of 0 to 4, ranging from none to severe. The severity of lysis was evaluated on the basis of both the extensiveness of the lysis and the depth of the subchondral bone affected. Sclerosis was graded from 0 to 3, ranging from none to severe, with severe designated as increased bone density affecting > 50% of the bone. Malformation was de- fined as an abnormal wedge shape or crushing and graded on a scale from 0 to 2, with 0 representing no evidence of malformation, 1 representing mild dorsal wedging, and 2 representing unequivocal severe asymmetry in the proximal-distal diameter of the bone or central crushing. Lesions of the proximal interphalangeal (pastern) joint - Evaluation of the pastern region was includ- ed in evaluation of the metacarpophalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints. Thickening of the dor- soproximal cortex of the middle phalanx of the hind limb was graded as absent (grade 0), mild (grade 1), moderate (grade 2), or severe (grade 3). If the dorsal border was irregular, a minimum of grade 2 was ap- plied. Osteophytosis of the dorsoproximal aspect of the hind limb middle phalanx was graded as 1 (pres- ent) or 0. Outcome parameters were as follows: 1. Did the horse compete in a cutting competition (yes or no)? 2. Did the horse earn money in a cutting competi- tion (yes or no)?The relationship between repository radiographic findings and subsequent performance of Quarter Horses competing in cutting events This is a summary for a study performed by Drs.

If so, how much? 4. If the horse did not compete, why not? Lesions of the medial femoral condyle were graded as follows: Grade 0 = normal appearance of the medial femo- ral condyle Grade 1 = flattened contour of the medial femoral condyle but no radiographic evidence of changes in the subchondral bone Grade 2 = Subchondral bone sclerosis defects in the subchondral bone that did not extend all the way through the deep portions of the subchondral bone plate or both Grade 3 = Defects that extended through the sub- chondral bone such as wide subchon- dral lucencies (SCL) Grade 4 = Well defined round or oval radiolucent area in the middle of the medial femoral condyle that extended to and communi- cated with the femoral tibial joint. Results Of 458 eligible horses, 343 had complete radio- graphic studies available for review and were in- cluded in the study. For 27 of these horses, radio- graphs were obtained from the privately-owned cutting horse ranch. Earnings data were available from the NCHA database for 178 of the 343 (52%) horses included in the study. Horses for which earn- ings data were not avail-able either did not compete or competed but did not earn any money. Therefore, for all horses for which earnings data were not avail- able, an attempt was made to determine whether the horse had or had not competed through the use of a mailed questionnaire or telephone calls to the owner. Information on whether the horse did or did not compete was available for 103 of the 165 (62%) hors- es for which earnings data were not available. Of these 103 horses, 29 (28%) competed but did not earn money and 74 (72%) did not compete. For hors- es that did not compete, lameness diagnosed by a veterinarian was the most commonly reported rea-son (n = 16 [22%]). Lameness referable to the stifle region was reported in 2 of the 16 horses, 1 of which had radiographically normal stifle joints and 1 of which had bilateral grade 3 medial femoral condyle lesions. Lameness affecting both the tarsal and stifle joints was reported in 1 horse that radiographical- ly had mild osteophytosis of the distal tarsal joints and radiographically normal stifle joints. Lameness affecting the tarsal joints only was reported in 2 horses, 1 of which had radiographically normal tarsal joints and 1 of which had mild osteophytosis of the distal tarsal joints. Four horses had lameness attrib- utable to suspensory ligament injuries. Other report- ed reasons that horses did not compete included that they were used for other disciplines, had insuf- ficient talent, had medical restrictions unrelated to lameness, and were still in training.Figure 1.

These images illustrate the grading scheme for evaluation of the medial femoral condyle. A - A flattened contour of the medial femoral condyle is present but without any evidence of changes to the subchondral bone (grade 1). B - Notice the mild subchondral bone sclerosis and a subtle shallow defect in the subchondral bone that does not extend all the way through the deep portion of the subchondral bone plate (grade 2). C - A shallow concave defect that extends through the subchondral bone is evident (grade 3). D - A well-defined, round radiolucent cyst-like lesion is present medial femoral condyle (grade 4). 130 ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH CENTERRESEARCH | FOCUS 2 - Early Diagnosis of Bone and Joint Disease Analysis of the likelihood (yes vs no) that horses would compete included data only for the 281 hors- es that were definitively known to have (n = 207) or to have not (74) competed. Analyses of the like- lihood (yes vs no) that horses earned money as a 3-year-old, as a 4-year-old, or as a 3- and 4-year-old combined were performed with data for all 343 hors- es included in the study Analyses of the amount of money earned as a 3-year-old, as a 4-year-old, and as a 3- and 4-year-old combined were performed with data for the 178 horses for which earnings data were available. Only 2 of the 7 radiographic lesions included in the analyses were significantly associated with perfor- mance outcomes: presence of osteophytes involv- ing the distal aspect of the tarsal joint, and presence of osteophytes on the dorsoproximal aspect of the hind limb middle phalanx. The presence of grade 2 osteophytosis involving the distal aspect of the tar- sal joint was associated with significantly increased odds of not earning money as a 3-year-old (P = 0.01; OR, 3.19; 95% CI, 1.29 to 7.91; r2 = 0.05) and as a 4-year-old (P = 0.003; OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.38 to 4.56; r2 = 0.08). The presence of grade 1 osteophytosis of the distal aspect of the tarsal joint was also as- sociated with a significantly increased odds of not earning money as a 4-year-old (P = 0.014; OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.17 to 4.06; r2 = 0.08). Conversely, the pres- ence of an osteophyte on the dorsoproximal aspect of the hind limb middle phalanx was associated with significantly decreased odds of not earning money as a 4-year-old (P = 0.004; OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.71; r2 = 0.08). The remaining 5 radiographic lesions included in the analyses (abnormalities of the medial femoral condyle, subchondral lysis of the distal aspect of the tarsal joint, sclerosis of the distal aspect of the tar- sal joint, malformation of the central and third tarsal bones, and thickening of the dorsoproximal cortex of the middle phalanx of the hind limb) were not sig- nificantly associated with performance outcomes. Discussion Results of the present study suggested that most abnormalities identified on repository radiographs of Quarter Horses competing in cutting events were not significantly associated with subsequent per-formance. However, the number of horses included in the study likely affected our results. In particular, some radiographic findings of interest affected a small number of horses, resulting in a low power to detect significant associations between the radio- graphic findings and subsequent performance.Table 1.

The 2 radiographic findings that were significantly associated with performance out- come in the present study were osteophytosis of the dorsoproximal aspect of the middle phalanx of the hind limb and osteophytosis of the distal aspect of the tarsal joint. Interestingly, mild (grade 1 or 2) osteophytosis of the distal aspect of the tarsal joint was the only finding that was significantly associ- ated with decreased performance (i.e., decreased likelihood of earning money as a 3-year-old and as a 4-year-old and decreased earnings as a 4-year-old). These findings were surprising, as we had hypoth- esized that mild changes would be unlikely to be clinically important, in contrast with severe lesions, which we expected to be more likely to be signifi- cantly associated with performance. Whereas we, as other clinicians, have anecdotally considered small osteophytes of the distal aspect of the tarsal joint to be of questionable clinical im- portance, the results of the present study may lead us to question this assumption. The finding of the present study that the presence of medium and large osteophytes (grades 3 and 4) was not signifi- cantly associated with performance outcome could have been a result, in part, of the low number of horses with these lesions (31/343 [9%] horses) and the unequal numbers of horses in the osteophyto- sis categories, resulting in a low power to detect differences among groups. It is not uncommon in cutting horses for intra-articular medication of the tarsal joint to be administered without prior diagnos- tic analgesia to con-firm the joint as the source of lameness. Therefore, we suggest that it would also not be surprising to find that horses with moderate to marked radiographic changes were more likely to be treated empirically with intra-articular joint medications, which may have helped improve their performance. Conversely, milder osteophytosis may have been more likely to be dismissed as unimport- ant, such that these horses would then be less likely to receive intra-articular treatments. Interestingly, although lameness referable to the stifle joint, particularly the medial femoral condyle, is a major concern for veterinarians treating horses competing in cutting events, radiographic abnor- malities of the medial femoral condyle were not sig- nificantly associated with performance outcome in the present study. This result was in contrast to our hypothesis that moderate to severe lesions of the medial femoral condyle would be associated with a poorer performance outcome. Our results sug- gested that lesions of the medial femoral condyle may not restrict a cutting horse's ability to perform successfully, at least for the limited period of time early in its career that, in the cutting horse industry, is the time of greatest earning potential. As for oth- er lesions, it is possible that the lack of significant findings could have been a result of a low power in some analyses, particularly analyses of earnings. However, the power for detecting a 15% difference in odds of earning money was 80%. Thus, we sug- gest that it should have been possible to detect a clinically relevant difference if one were present. However, it must be kept in mind when interpret- ing the results of the present study that lameness was not an outcome variable. Whereas an attempt was made to contact the owners of horses that did not earn money to find out why, further follow-up in- formation was not obtained for horses that earned money. Thus, it is possible that there were horses with stifle joint lesions that were able to compete and earn money, yet still developed manageable lameness. As in any study evaluating radiographs submit-ted to a repository, there was a risk that horses with more severe lesions may not have been included in the sale, decreasing the number of radiographs evaluated in the present study from horses with moderate to severe radiographic lesions. As such, we may have underestimated both the prevalence and potential effect that more severe lesions could have on performance outcome in the overall popu- lation of horses competing in cutting events. None- theless, we suggest that despite these limitations, the radiographic findings of the present study are a useful representation of the lesions found in horses sold for cutting events at major sales, and it is the performance outcome of these horses that is of par- ticular concern in the cutting horse industry. 132 ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH CENTERRESEARCH | FOCUS 2 - Early Diagnosis of Bone and Joint Disease References 1.

The study resulted in an antenna design with improved measurement sensitivity, and the feasibil- ity was demonstrated for measuring deflections of a fracture fixation plate under an applied load. This technology has the potential to improve the treat- ment of fractures on the path to non-union by pro- viding an early diagnosis of aberrant healing. Introduction Approximately 10% of bone fractures do not heal properly [1], and the deleterious effects and resul- tant costs of fracture non-union can be reduced by an estimated 50% if addressed in the early time period of healing when therapies can be most ef- fective [2]. However, radiographic evidence which comprises the current standard of care, fails to pro- vide an early diagnosis of non-union bone healing. A promising approach for monitoring and predicting the course of bone fracture healing is by measuring the mechanical load-sharing between the healing callus and the implanted fixation hardware. Previous technologies have used implantable sensors which require modification to the fixation hardware and may carry long term biocompatibility risks. The ob- jective of this study was to optimize and evaluate a method of externally sensing hardware load-sharing based on the electromagnetic near field effects of a radio-frequency antenna. Methods Previous work by our group used a custom antenna, consisting of two parallel coaxial cables, to probe a passive strain sensor [3]. Because this antenna type was observed to be highly sensitive to a fracture fix- ation plate deflecting under an applied load, it was chosen for optimization as an object displacement sensor for the intended application and current study. The antenna works by detecting movement of a target object (metal fracture plate) within the electromagnetic near field via shifts in the antenna's apparent resonant frequency (ARF). Over time as a fracture heals, the callus stiffens, resulting in lower plate deflections (and thus lower ARF shifts) relative to the applied load. Therefore, the changes in con- secutive measurements over time may inform on the progress of healing. This study included a series of two parametric tests intended to optimize the sensitivity of the antenna to the displacement of a metal plate. The param- eters tested were (1) the placement of the plate along the length of the antenna and (2) the spac- ing between the two coaxial cables. The results of these parametric tests formed the basis for a new antenna design. The resulting antenna underwent two tests to determine its efficacy for sensing the displacement of a metal plate and the deflection of a metal orthopaedic plate in a modeled fracture con- dition. The physical experiments were augmented with mechanical finite element and electromagnetic computational simulations. Results The parametric test on cable spacing indicated that as the distance between the two antenna cables in- creased, the sensitivity if the antenna ARF to plate movement also increased. The parametric test on plate location along the antenna length demonstrat- ed multiple locations on the antenna that were most sensitive to movement of the plate, which depend- ed on the harmonic frequency range tested. Spe- cifically, for the third resonant frequency harmonic, there were three locations of greatest sensitivity along the length of the antenna. Therefore, an op-A coaxial dipole antenna for passively sensing object displacement and deflection for orthopaedic applications This is a summary of an article by Drs. Kevin M. Labus, Branislav M.

Also, the cable spacing was maximized to increase sensitivity, although lim- ited by size constraints for the intended application. The plate displacement test on the optimized anten- na showed a highly sensitive, nonlinear relationship between ARF and plate displacement. A test mod- eling a fracture condition under a compressive load showed a clear shift in the ARF due to the deflection of the fracture plate, and the ARF had a highly linear response to applied load (Figure 1). Electromagnetic computational predictions matched the experimen- tal results within 0.05% error. Conclusions Parametric tests on the antenna's geometry result- ed in an antenna design that was optimized for high sensitivity to displacements of a metal plate. Testing on that plate confirmed that this measurement sys- tem is feasible for measuring the bending deflection of a fracture fixation plate under an applied load. This system has the potential to be used to detect stiffness changes in a fracture that are related to healing to monitor the early progress of healing. References 1. A. Praemer, S. Furner, and D.

Introduction Typically, the use of radiography and arthroscopy together with a physical examination and intra-artic- ular anesthesia are used to diagnose equine stifle disease. However, radiography is unable to provide adequate information on the soft tissue structures. There is very minimal association between the ra- diographic severity grade of the surgery with cases specific to stifle lameness. Radiography also has a difficult time diagnosing mild to severe soft tissue le- sions. Arthroscopy allows certain meniscal tears and their morphology and severity to be diagnosed but it also has its limitations. The narrow joint space lim- its the arthroscopic examination and by only using arthroscopy some injuries in certain locations can remain undiagnosed. Ultrasonography is a more sensitive diagnostic in- strument for intra-articular soft tissue evaluation in the equine stifle. It has a sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of meniscal injury and some meniscal lesions may only be diagnosed with ultrasonogra- phy. Ultrasonography is also the most adequate di- agnostic technique for evaluating patellar ligament injuries. The hypotheses of the study were: 1) Ultrasonography will detect more lesions of the menisci compared with arthroscopy, arthrosco- py is more likely than ultrasonography to detect cartilage lesions of the femoral condyles and cranial meniscotibial ligament injuries.2) Ultrasonography is less likely to detect more subtle intra-articular lesions in the stifle com- pared with arthroscopy. 3) Ultrasonography and arthroscopy alone are not sufficient to fully assess damaged tissues within the stifle. Methods The structures of the stifle joint were evaluated and graded for pathological change by scoring ar- throscopic and ultrasonographic examinations. The presence and severity of the lesions were then com- pared between each instrument. Results It was then observed that medial meniscal lesions were detected more often with ultrasonography. Conversely, arthroscopy was better for the medial meniscotibial ligament tear- ing. were arthroscopy periarticular osteophytes of the medial femoral condyle with ultrasonography. Four cases had defects within one of the patellar ligaments, all of which were only characterized with ultrasonography. Conclusion The study found that some structures in the equine stifle are best evaluated by ultrasonography and others by arthroscopy. More meniscal lesions were diagnosed with ultrasonography than arthroscopy, however, articular cartilage lesions within the fem- oral condyles and tearing of the cranial meniscotib- ial ligament were better detected with arthroscopy. Subtle lesions in the lateral meniscus and articular cartilage defects of the medial femoral condyle are less likely to be detected with ultrasonography compared with arthroscopy.

Introduction Physical examination, radiography, arthroscopy and intra-articular anesthesia have traditionally been utilized to diagnose and monitor lesions associat- ed with equine stifle disease. Radiographic exam- ination allows proper evaluation of osseous abnor- malities in the stifle but provide minimal information regarding soft tissue structures. Despite normal ra- diographic findings, there can be mild to severe soft tissue lesions present that go undetected. To properly diagnose and appreciate pathologic changes associated with equine stifle disease, it is ideal to utilize various imaging modalities, such as arthroscopy and ultrasonography, in addition to traditional diagnostic practices, depending on the location of the lesion. Arthroscopic examination is advantageous in diagnosing certain meniscal tears and aids in characterizing morphology and severi- ty. However, examination of the cranial and caudal aspects of the medial and lateral femorotibial joints as well as the axial and abaxial menisci borders are limited with arthroscopy. Ultrasonography is a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic modality that aids in diagnosing and evaluating intra-articular soft tissues lesions; there are specific meniscal le- sions that are only identifiable with ultrasonography. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is diagnostical- ly effective at providing additional anatomic detail, including cruciate ligaments and articular cartilage defects. Depending on the location and severity of the lesion, there are diagnostic modalities that bet- ter characterize equine stifle lesions in comparison. This retrospective study investigated and compared the ability of diagnostic imaging modalities, such as arthroscopy and ultrasonography, to properly iden- tify presence, severity, and location of pathologic changes within the equine stifle by investigating medial and lateral meniscus, medial and lateral cra- nial medial femo- ral condyle, and patellar ligaments. Methods Ultrasonographic still and arthroscopic images and videos of 47 stifles were retrospectively evaluated from 37 horses that were admitted to the Colora- do State University equine hospital for stifle lame- ness between 2007 and 2011. All ultrasonographic and arthroscopic examination and imaging proto- cols were similar between cases and performed by board-certified veterinary radiologists or a super- vised resident. For the ultrasonographic images, 2 ACVR board certified radiologists and a radiology resident graded each unaware of the arthroscopic findings. For arthroscopy, each image was graded by 2 ACVR board certified surgeons that did not re- view the ultrasonographic findings prior to review. Lesion evaluation was based on grading systems designed for the medial and lateral meniscus, medi- al and lateral meniscus ultrasonographic (transverse images) and arthroscopic images were graded with a total of 47 medial menisci evaluated with 25 identified lesions. For each modality, the grading criteria involved presence of a defect (yes, no), defect severity (slight, mild, moderate, severe), orientation (horizontal, vertical, oblique, round, sur- face defect), location (abaxial, axial, femoral, tibial, A comparison of arthroscopy to ultrasonography for identification of pathology of the equine stifle This is a summary of an article by Drs.

For ultrasonography, the echogenic- ity (homogenous/heterogeneous) of the ligaments in the long axis was assessed and compared to arthroscopic evidence of fibrillation/tearing (slight, mild, moderate, severe).The medial and lateral femoral condyles were graded for both ultrasonog- raphy (long and/or short axis views) based on the presence of an articular cartilage defect, the size of the articular cartilage defect, osteophytosis, and the presence of subchondral bone defect. Ultrasonography (long and/or short axis views was the only diagnostic modality used to grade medial, lateral, and lateral patellar ligaments. Patellar liga- ments were graded on echogenicity (homogenous/ heterogeneous) of ligaments, presence of a defect, location, length, diameter, and thickening (slight, mild, moderate, severe) of defects associated with ligaments. Results Ultrasonography exhibited a significant difference (P = .02, number with differing findings = 16 (N=16), Supplementary Item 1) in medial meniscus lesion detection compared to arthroscopy. Although 9 lesions were identified by both modalities with 4 similar grades (2 slight and 2 severe), there were 13 lesions (4 mild, 7 moderate, and 2 severe lesions) detected by ultrasonography that were not detect- ed by arthroscopy. For the lesions detected by both modalities, 2 lesions were located in the cranial horn, 4 within the middle aspect, and 2 extending from the cranial horn to the middle aspect. There were 3 lesions in the cranial horn only detected via arthroscopy. Arthroscopic examination did not de- tect 4 lesions in the cranial horn, 3 lesions in the body, 2 lesions in the caudal horn, 2 lesions that extended from the cranial horn to the body, and one lesion that extended through the entire medial meniscus. For the lesions only detected by ultraso- nography, one extended along the axial surface, 7 extended along the abaxial surface, and 2 were full thickness lesions. One lesion was arthroscopically classified as a full thickness tear, however, the le- sion was classified as an abaxial defect with ultra- sonography. Two lesions detected on the axial mar- gin of meniscus by arthroscopy were diagnosed as intrasubstance lesion and a the axial to abaxial aspects. Ultrasonographic eval- uation yielded significantly higher severity grades compared to arthroscopy (16 vs. 6 times, P = 0.052, number with differing findings = 22 (N = 22), Supple- mentary Item 1). If the grading of the ultrasonogra- phy and arthroscopy images differed by more than one grade, the score of the ultrasonography images were higher significantly more often, 14 times, than the score of the arthroscopy examination, 4 times (P = 0.031, Supplementary Item 1). There was no significant difference (P = 1.0, number with differing findings = 5 (N = 5), Supplementary Item 1) between ultrasonography and arthroscopy for lateral meniscus lesion detection. A total of 34 lateral menisci were evaluated with 6 detected le- sions. There are 3 lesions (2 slight, one mild) located on the cranial horn only detected by arthroscopic examination; Ultrasonography revealed one lesion considered to be within the cranial horn extended throughout the entire lateral meniscus into the cau- dal horn. Arthroscopic examination revealed three lesions on the axial aspect that were not detected via ultrasonography; Ultrasonography revealed that one lesion found on the axial aspect of the later- al meniscus via arthroscopy was shown to extend from the axial to the abaxial aspect of the lateral meniscus via ultrasonography. Two lesions (one moderate, one severe) were only identified using ultrasonography with one lesion within the abaxial aspect of the meniscus and one extended from axial to abaxial insertion of the menis- ligament in 25 arthroscopy and ultrasonography graded 15 os- seous insertions as normal one as proliferative. Arthroscopy graded 2 insertions as proliferative that were graded as normal via ultrasonography. Ultraso- nography graded one insertion as resorptive and 6 as proliferative that were graded as normal with ar- throscopy. Arthroscopic and ultrasonographic imag- es ligament from 2017-18 REPORT 139RESEARCH | FOCUS 2 - Early Diagnosis of Bone and Joint Disease 29 stifles were evaluated for tearing. Arthroscopy exhibited a significant difference (P = 0.02, number with differing findings = 11 (N = 11), Supplementary Item 1) for detecting medial cranial meniscotibial lig- ament lesions compared to ultrasonography (Figure 3). There were 18 stifles with normal echogenicity and no arthroscopic evidence of tearing. There were 9 tears detected by arthroscopy with only one lesion exhibiting slight ultrasonographic echogenic- ity change. There were two ligaments with slight, 3 with mild, and 3 with severe tears that had normal ultrasonographic echogenicity. Arthroscopy exhibited a significant difference (P<0.0001, number with differing findings = 21 (N = 21), Supplementary Item 1) in articular cartilage de- fect detection compared to ultrasonography. A to- of 27 medial femoral condyles were evaluated with 21(2 slight, 9 mild, 9 moderate, and one severe, Figure 4) articular cartilage defects detected by ar- throscopy that were not detected by ultrasonogra- phy. Arthroscopy also exhibited a significantly (23 times vs. 3 times, P<0.001, number with differing findings = 26 (N = 26), Supplementary Item 1) higher severity gradings associated with femoral condyle articular cartilage defects compared to ultrasonog- raphy. Two defects graded as severe with arthrosco- py were graded as mild and moderate, respectively, with ultrasonography. If there was agreement within one grade There was no significant difference (P>0.9, number with differing findings = 15 (N =15), Figure 5, Sup- plementary Item 1) in lesion detection regarding subchondral bone defects between arthroscopy and ultrasonography. Both modalities graded 8 as normal and 11 with subchondral bone defects. Only 4 defects were diagnosed using only one modali- ty. Ultrasonographic gradings were lower than ar- throscopic gradings for 5 defects with no significant difference when comparing absolute grades to ar- throscopy. Two lateral femoral condyles were eval- uated and both had subchondral bone defects only diagnosed with arthroscopy. There was a significant difference (P<0.001, number with differing findings = 14 (N = 14), Supplementary Item 1) between the osteophyte detection with ul-trasonography detecting more lesions than arthros- copy. From the total 18 medial femoral condyles that were evaluated for periarticular osteophytosis, there were 3 graded as normal by both modalities and one stifle with osteophytosis along the medial femoral condyle. Ultrasonography graded 14 stifles Figure 3. Ultrasound and arthroscopy images of the medial cranial meniscotibial ligaments from 2 different horses.

A total of 35 medial patellar, 41 middle patellar, and 34 lateral patellar ligaments evaluated using ultrasonography, only. Two medial patellar liga- ments had thickening and altered echogenicity (one moderate and one severe) while 3 medial patellar ligaments had a discrete defect (one mild, 2 severe) and one of these 3 was also one of the 2 with diffuse echogenic change (Figure 6). One middle patellar ligament had mild echogenic changes, while anoth- er middle patellar ligament had severe echogenic changes, thickening and a severe distinct defect in the middle to distal aspect. All lateral patellar liga- ments had normal echogenicity; however, one was slightly thickened. Conclusion The study reveals that specific structures of the equine stifle are better evaluated with ultrasonog- raphy than arthroscopy and vice versa. Ultrasonog- raphy allowed enhanced evaluation of periarticular soft tissues and lesions associated with patellar lig- aments. To properly evaluate pathologic changes associated with stifle disease, a thorough ultraso- nography and arthroscopic examination should be performed. References 1. Walmsley, J.P.

Introduction Radiographic flexor cortical lysis indicates advanced degenerative change and its earlier recognition may improve case outcome. Aims of this prospective, di- agnostic accuracy study were to determine effects of radiographic beam angle and observer on accu- racy of lesion detection. Methods The sample included 36 limbs from 31 horses. Pal- maroproximal-palmarodistal oblique (skyline) radio- graphs were acquired at standard (n=38) and more shallow (alternate) angles (n=58). Images were in- dependently reviewed by four experience levels of five observers each (n=20) for the presence and se- verity of flexor cortical lysis. Observers also report- ed their confidence in these answers. Responses were compared based on seeing a standard skyline or multiple projections. The definitive presence (or absence) and severity of lysis was based upon ra- diologist consensus agreement. Results When assessed by observer, the identification of ly- sis and the assessment of its severity was most sim- ilar to that of radiologists when observers of all lev- els of experience were able to view multiple skyline projections (P = 0.399 and P= 0.174). Using multiple views to detect lysis resulted in improved sensitivi- ty (85.3% vs 97.2%, P<0.001), decreased specificity (82.8% vs. 74.5%, P = 0.03), and improved interob- server agreement (86.0% vs. 90.2%, P = 0.21). On average, observers of all levels of experience be- came more confident viewing multiple projections (P< 0.001). Conclusions Findings from this study supported acquiring an additional skyline view at an alternate angle of in- cidence. This view resulted in improved sensitivity, decreased specificity, and overall improved interob- server agreement among observers of various ex- perience levels. Additionally, radiographic detection and characterization of flexor cortical lysis severity in observers of various experience levels was sim- ilar to that of radiologists when an additional, shal- low view was provided. When one to two alternate angle skyline views were available in addition to the standard skyline view, interpreter confidence in- creased on average 30% of the time. The standard recommendation to obtain an optimally positioned navicular skyline radiograph by positioning the x-ray beam tangential to the flexor surface of the navicu- lar bone13 may therefore not identify all lesions of the flexor cortex. The curvature of the flexor cortex may limit a single beam angle from highlighting the proximal to distal surface entirely within one radio- graphic projection; therefore, an additional skyline radiograph made with a more shallow beam an- gle is recommended when flexor cortical lysis is suspected.

This allows visu- alization of detailed structural characteristics, such as striations and variations in signal intensity that are not well documented on low field MRI. Findings were comparable between gross evaluation and MRI, and this study provides detailed descriptions of the normal appearance of the soft tissue struc- tures of the equine stifle on high field MRI, including how to optimize evaluation of specific structures via selection of specific sequences or planes of acqui- sition. Introduction The equine stifle is a large and complex joint, with numerous intra- and periarticular structures that may be injured via trauma or overuse, resulting in the stifle joint being a frequent source of lameness or poor performance.2,3 The deep location of multi- ple of the soft tissue structures and the restricted ability to distract the joint are factors that inhibit the diagnostic value of standard imaging modalities such as radiography or ultrasound.4,5 In particular, complete assessment of the cranial and caudal me- niscotibial ligaments, the cranial and ligaments, the meniscofemoral articular cartilage, and subchondral bone is virtually impos- sible with any one modality, including diagnostic ar- throscopy6,7 but may be more thoroughly evaluated with three-dimensional advanced imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging is considered to be the gold standard for non-invasive imaging diagno- sis of soft tissue or cartilage abnormalities.8,9 Cur- rently, utility of high field equine stifle MRI is limited by there being only a small number of locations able to provide this service. Additionally, at present, pa-tient selection for equine stifle in high field MRI sys- tems is restricted by bore configuration and patient size.10,11 Continued pursuit of advanced imaging in the equine athlete has led to specific MRI techniques for regions of interest in the distal limb;9,12 howev- er, stifle MRI is still a new and developing field.13,14 Accurate interpretation of clinical MRI studies of the equine stifle requires a good understanding of the normal anatomical appearance of the soft tissue structures of the stifle and clinical application of MRI physics. Development of an optimized protocol spe- cific to the equine stifle is indicated. The primary aims of this study were to develop an optimized high field MRI protocol for evaluation of the equine stifle, and to provide detailed descrip- tions of the normal high field MRI appearance of the soft tissues for use as a reference in future studies of clinically affected horses. A secondary aim was to specifically emphasize sequence selection and choice of slice orientation to optimize evaluation of structures that are poorly visualized with other non-invasive imaging modalities, such as the cranial and caudal cruciate ligaments. Methods The study was a prospective, anatomic design; it involved the use of no live animals. Materials were gathered postmortem and owner permission for postmortem examination and use of tissue for re- search was given. Nine cadaver stifles were col- lected from clinical cases euthanized for reasons unrelated to hind limb lameness. Each case history was reviewed to establish no record of stifle related lameness and each limb was confirmed within nor- mal limits on palpation before inclusion in the study.High field magnetic resonance imaging is comparable with gross anatomy for description of the normal appearance of soft tissues in the equine stifle This is a summary of an article by Drs. Jodie Daglish, Dave Frisbie, Kurt Selberg and Myra Barrett, published in Veterinary Radiology and Ultrasound in 2018.1 146 ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH CENTERRESEARCH | FOCUS 2 - Early Diagnosis of Bone and Joint Disease Limbs were each imaged 1-2 hours post mortem. Ul- trasound evaluation of the stifle was performed as described by Barrett et al.,4 to establish normality of the soft tissue structures of the joint. Each limb was then imaged in a 1.5 T MRI scanner, utilizing an extensive protocol designed to produce multiple imaging sequences suitable for comparison of the appearance of each soft tissue structure between sequences, and to best determine which sequences would be useful implemented in a clinical protocol. Specialized oblique plane images were acquired to capture the anatomical extent and appearance of the cranial cruciate ligament (Figure 1). Each MRI sequence was evaluated to determine which best delineated the anatomical boundaries of each structure, including the patellar ligaments, joint capsules, collateral ligaments, articular cartilage of the femoral condyles, trochlear ridges, trochlear patellar, menisci and associated liga-ments, and the cruciate ligaments. Each structure was then described with respect to shape, position, signal intensity on each sequence and finally, rela- tionship with associated structures. Areas previous- ly reported as common sites of structural abnormal- ity13,14 were specifically evaluated for relative signal intensity, particularly for differences between proton density fast spin echo (FSE) and T2 FSE weighted sequence appearance, for subsequent comparison with gross findings. Lastly, each stifle was grossly evaluated. The struc- tures named above were evaluated in detail follow- ing dissection. Specifically, for each structure, signs of inflammatory change, alteration in structural in- tegrity, and congruity of bone-soft tissue interfaces were assessed and recorded. The appearance of each structure was compared with the optimized MRI images for conformation of anatomical charac- teristics.Figure 1.

Preferred sequences found to be most useful for evaluation of the soft tissue structures of the stifle on MRI were presented and MRI details of specific structures are documented below. Menisci The curving fibers of the lateral and medial margins of the medial meniscus are subject to magic angle artifact that is observed as intermediate weighted signal compared to the low signal intensity of the mid body of the structure. Magic angle effect at this location is confirmed by comparing the region of in- creased signal on proton density FSE sequences to the homogenous, meniscus on T2 FSE sequences. T2 FSE images are less susceptible to magic angle artifact (Figure 2).15 and confirm this as the MRI appearance of a normal meniscus. Meniscotibial ligaments The medial and lateral cranial and (medial) caudal meniscotibial ligaments have low intensity signal with intermediate weighted signal striations best observed on transverse and transverse oblique planes. On sagittal plane images, the striations appear as punctate intermediate signal within the low signal intensity ligament. Grossly, all stifles had broadly separated and prominent striations within each of these ligaments, with no overlying fascial tissue, (Figure 3). High signal intensity striations within the ligament on short tau inversion recov- ery sequences were not associated with any gross findings that would be indicative of tearing at these Figure 3.

The tendon of popliteus has a similar signal inten- sity as the lateral meniscus in all sequences, and causes the caudal margin of the lateral meniscus to appear irregular or undulating, with an inconsistent region of intermediate signal intensity observed at the junction between the two structures. The origin of the tendon of popliteus is also closely associated with the proximal third of the lateral collateral lig- ament, making differentiation of the two structures difficult on standard plane sequences. Careful con- sideration of these structures on tangential imaging planes is required to accurately assess the margins of each. Cruciate ligaments The cranial cruciate ligament is intermediate weight- ed on proton density and diffusely intensity dif- fusely increased signal density FSE and intermediate on T2 FSE sequences) associated with the proximal and distal surfaces of the ligament, and within the distal third of the ligament. This corre- sponds to twisting of the ligament fibers from prox- imal to distal and the presence of shallow striations and fanning of the ligament as it broadens to attach at the medial aspect of the cranial intercondylar em- inence. Due to the oblique orientation of the ligament from proximal, caudal, and lateral to distal, cranial, and medial, it is not seen in its entirety on any standard plane images. Specifically developed, obliquely ori- ented sequences (Figure 4) improve the assessment of the origin, body and insertion of the cranial cru- ciate ligament, as has been found in the human pa- tient.16 The ligament structure is best assessed with sagittal oblique plane images. Transverse oblique plane images allow complete evaluation of the bone attachment at origin and insertion and are useful for assessment of resorption or change in bone density associated with potential pathology at these sites. Conclusions In conclusion, high field MRI provides highly de- tailed assessment of equine stifle soft tissues. The structures of the stifle are numerous, are uniquely orientated relative to each other, and have specific anatomic or structural variations individual to each Figure 4.

Interpretation of studies acquired is there- fore challenging and requires good knowledge of anatomic detail, a clear understanding of the phys- ics of MRI and exposure to multiple studies for famil- iarization before diagnoses can be made with confi- dence. Future studies are needed to determine the clinical application of high field MRI of the equine stifle. The MRI appearance of the soft tissues of the stifle compared with arthroscopic appearance of those visible intra-articularly will provide useful information. Similarly, performing cadaver studies on horses with known stifle disease can provide a greater understanding of how progressive disease within the joint may influence the health of the struc- tures not commonly evaluated with routine radio- graphs and ultrasound.

Evaluation of the two bundles of the anterior cruciate ligament with 1.5 | FOCUS 2 - Early Diagnosis of Bone and Joint Disease Take home message This study reveals that a range of lesions in the dis- tal tarsus and proximal metatarsus are common in lame horses with a positive response to diagnostic analgesia of the proximal suspensory ligament. It is recommended that standardized MRI is utilized to include both the tarsus and proximal metatarsus for complete evaluation of both anatomic regions. Introduction Although radiography is often utilized to diagnose hind limb lameness due to lesions in the distal tar- sus, there are many lesions in the distal tarsus and proximal metatarsus that are undetected by tradi- tional radiographic examination. Magnetic reso- nance imaging (MRI) and lameness via local and intra-articular analgesia possess diag- nostic advantages that enhance evaluation of these lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can iden- tify bone marrow lesions within distal tarsal bones, commonly affecting the central tarsal bones. The diagnostic modality has been reported to be useful in detecting osteoarthritis and subchondral cystic lesions of the distal intertarsal and tarsometatarsal joints that could not be characterized radiograph- ically. MRI has also been proven to characterize fractures of the distal tarsus more effectively than radiographic examination. The goal of the study is to further characterize and describe MRI lesions found in the equine distal tarsus in a larger sample group than previous research. The study aims to compare these findings to the horses' clinical history, includ- ing degree of lameness and results of diagnostic analgesia to MRI findings. Methods The retrospective, observational study consisted of evaluation of MRI exams of the distal tarsus and proximal metatarsus between 2012 and 2014. There were 125 limbs from 103 horses evaluated by two board-certified veterinary radiologists, who were blinded to the clinical presentation of the patient. The MRIs were evaluated for soft tissue and osse- ous changes that were characterized and graded by degree of severity. Patient signalment, lameness severity, and results of diagnostic analgesia were recorded. The following MRI lesions were recorded for each scan: osteoarthritic changes subchondral lysis, and osteophytosis); sclerosis and bone marrow lesions of the cuboidal bones; and degenerative changes of the second or fourth tarsal bones and their articulations with the central and third tarsal bones. Subchondral cystic lesions were also recorded and were defined as well-defined, smooth lesions that extended into the trabecular bone of the cuboidal bones and had in- ternal signal characteristics consistent with fluid. De- generative changes of the interosseous ligaments (intertarsal desmopathy) respective fossae intertarsal and tarsometatarsal joints (in- tertarsal enthesopathy) were defined as thickening and abnormal signal intensity of the ligament and altered shape and sclerosis of the ligament fossa. The proximal suspensory ligament was evaluated for evidence of desmopathy and the proximal third metatarsal bone for enthesopathy and bone marrow lesions associated with the origin of the suspensory ligament. All findings were graded on a scale of 0-3, for normal, mild, moderate, and severe change. The radiologists recorded scores independently and consensus was reached on discordant scores.High field magnetic resonance imaging contributes to diagnosis of equine distal tarsus and proximal metatarsus lesions: 103 horses This is a summary of an article by Drs. M Barrett, K Selberg, S Johnson, J Hersman, and D Frisbie published in Veterinary Radiology and Ultrasound. 2017-18 REPORT 151RESEARCH | FOCUS 2 - Early Diagnosis of Bone and Joint Disease Results The most common finding that affected 100 limbs was sclerosis of the central tarsal bone with 48 mod- erate and four severe cases. Sclerosis of the third tarsal bone affected 70 limbs with 27 moderate and four severe cases. Osteophytosis of the distal inter- tarsal joint affected 87 limbs, with 21 moderate and 10 severe, and affected the tarsometatarsal joint in 64 limbs with nine moderate and five severe. Sub- chondral bone lysis and articular cartilage damage was found in the distal intertarsal joint of 52 limbs and in the tarsometatarsal in 64 limbs. Fifteen limbs had moderate distal intertarsal sub- chondral lysis and eight had severe subchondral the limbs with moderate or severe distal intertarsal lysis, the most change was appreciated dorsally in 10 limbs, while it was diffuse in nine and confined to the plantar third of the joint in four limbs. Articular cartilage damage in the distal intertarsal or tarsometatarsal joint without concurrent mild lysis of the subchondral bone was rare, affecting only eight limbs. While the articular cartilage was generally best assessed on the proton density-fat saturated images, often the more subtle concurrent subchon- dral bone lesions were best appreciated with the volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination im- ages (Figure 1).

The severity of MRI findings is not cor- related with the degree of lameness.

Radiographic and ultrasonographic imaging of lesions responsi- ble for lameness can provide ambiguous results, but MRI provides the most comprehensive diagnostic imaging evaluation of lesions specifically affecting cutting horses. Cutting horses with proximal meta- carpal pain have significant pathological change within both the proximal suspensory ligament and its enthesis on the palmar cortex of McIII. However, severity of lesions and degree of lameness at the time of diagnosis does not influence return to per- formance. Accurate diagnosis of proximal metacar- pal lesions based on MRI offers clinicians the capac- ity to select treatment protocols targeted to each disease process. Introduction Proximal metacarpal pain is a common source of lameness in performance horses.1-5 The Quarter Horse is the primary breed used in the western dis- cipline of cutting1-2, and these horses commence training as 2-year-olds and compete in Limited Age Events from 3 to 6 years of age.1-3 Cutting horses are of consistent phenotype, are selectively bred for ath- leticism and trainability, and undergo rigorous train- ing prior to reaching skeletal maturity.1-3 Lameness associated with proximal metacarpal pain can range from mild to severe.6-8 Although frequently used for evaluation of the proximal metacarpus, ultrasono- graphic and radiographic studies have scintigraphy (NS) of the proximal metacarpus and metatarsus has been described in normal and lame horses diagnosed with proximal suspensory desmitis, however, it lacks identify- change; however, CT cannot identify bone edema-like changes and provides lim-ited soft tissue detail, even with contrast enhance- ment.14 For these reasons, magnetic resonance im- aging (MRI) is considered the gold-standard imaging modality capable of providing best characterization of changes in both hard and soft tissues.15-18 Patho- logical changes within the proximal metacarpal area detected by MRI have shown good correlation with histological morphology of the PSL.16-18 The purpose of this investigation is to describe clinical lesions present in a group of horses with limited physiologi- cal variation, and document lesions associated with clinical lameness specific to the discipline of cutting. Secondly, this study aims to establish prognostic in- dicators for return to performance by evaluating a 24-month follow-up period on each case. Methods Retrospective analysis of 32 cutting horses referred for MRI of the proximal metacarpus between 2009 and 2012 with a 2-year follow-up period. Cases were included in retrospective analysis if they were referred for an MRI of the proximal metacarpus following lameness examination that localized a component of lameness to the proximal metacar- pus, and were registered Quarter Horses currently in training for, or competing in, cutting events. MRI studies were evaluated by a board-certified veteri- nary radiologist; the severity of lesions was graded from 0 (absent) to 3 (severe). Results A total of 20 right and 24 left forelimbs (12 bilater- al studies) of 32 horses were evaluated. The most common findings were: third metacarpal bone contusion (22/39). Of the 30 horses, 22 horses successfully returned to competition, irrespective of Magnetic resonance imaging findings of the proximal metacarpus in Quarter Horses used for cutting: retrospective analysis of 32 horses 2009-2012 This is a summary of an article by Drs.

Strong correlation exists between the degree of resorption in the palmar cortex of proximal McIII, degree of McIII sclerosis and severity of dorsal margin fiber irregularity. Conclusions It may be concluded that pathological change in both the PSL and proximal McIII are responsible for the clinical manifestation of PSD. Enlargement of the PSL can be subjectively assessed and confirmed with CSA measurement; an increase in this param- eter supports the presence of concurrent osseous resorption and sclerosis in palmar McIII. The sever- ity of these lesions does not appear to influence long-term athletic performance in the discipline of cutting. Future characterization of the disease pro- cess responsible for clinical lameness is essential to implement appropriate treatment and rehabilitation of PSD. References 1.

MRI imag- ing providing the most comprehensive diagnostic imaging modality to evaluate these lesions. Patho- logical changes within the proximal suspensory lig- enthesis are associated with proximal metacarpal pain in cut- ting horses. Based on the study, there was no signif- icant association between the degree of lameness and severity of lesions at the time of diagnosis and time to successful return to performance. Introduction Proximal metacarpal pain is a common source of lameness in performance horses, specifically in the western discipline of cutting. Lameness resulting from proximal metacarpal pain ranges from mild to severe. Although lameness can be localized via anesthesia of the lateral palmar nerve at accesso- ry carpal bone, anesthesia of the medial and lateral branches of the palmar metacarpal nerves, and di- rect infiltration of the proximal suspensory ligament, none of these techniques have proven specificity for diagnosing proximal suspensory disease (PSD). Ultrasonographic and radiographic examinations are frequently used for evaluation of the proximal metacarpus but possess limitations due to their lack of specificity and sensitivity. Radiographic evalu- ation of the proximal metacarpus can reveal the integrity of the third metacarpal bone (McIII), osseous irregularity of the second and fourth metacarpal bones (McII and McIV), and concurrent abnormalities in the carpus. Ultrasound techniques to evaluate the proximal suspensory ligament (PSL) and its attachment to the third metacarpal bone (McIII) has been described but can be complicated by acoustic shadowing and by the presence of fat and muscle fibers within the ligament, resulting in a heterogeneous appearance. Nuclear scintigra- phy of the proximal metacarpus and metatarsus has demonstrated sensitivity for identifying bone injury yet shows limited correlation with ultrasound in the forelimb. Computed tomography can identify patho- logic bone changes, but cannot identify bone oe- dema-like changes and provides limited soft tissue detail. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considered the gold-standard imaging modality to characterize changes in both hard and soft tissues. MRI detected pathological changes within the proximal metacar- pus show strong correlation histological mor- phology of the proximal suspensory ligament (PSL). MRI is commonly used to diagnose thickening of the suspensory ligament, discrete tearing, fibre origin, and exostoses between McII and McIV. The retrospective study aims to describe clinical le- sions present in a group of horses with limited phys- iological variation and document lesions associated with clinical lameness specific to the discipline of cutting. Additionally, the study establishes prognos- tic indicators for return to performance by evaluat- ing a 24-month follow-up period on each case. Methods A retrospective study investigated 32 cutting horses referred for MRI of the proximal metacarpus follow- ing a lameness examination that localized the lesion between 2009 and 2012 with a 2-year follow-up period.

In absence of the record, owners were contacted to establish the horse's participation in competition. MRI grading analysis was performed on a mini- mum of with frequent use of short TI inversion recovery (STIR) and T1 gradient echo (T1GRE) or in- terpolated breath sequences available. A single board-certified radiologist graded severity of pathological change from 0 (ab- sent) to 3 (severe) based on previously described pathologic lesions: PSL enlargement, dorsal sue architecture, periligamentous thickening, PD and STIR signal intensity of lesions, osseous prolif- eration at the enthesis on resorption within McIII, exos-toses between McIII and McII/IV, and the presence or absence of osteoarthritis in the carpometacarpal and middle carpal joints. PSL cross-sectional area was measured on transverse PD sequences at four equidistant locations between carpometacarpal joint and the nutrient foramen of McIII. Descriptive statistical analysis of type and distribu- tion of lesions was performed using Microsoft Excel; mean values were calculated and reported with 95% confidence interval.

In a similar fashion, a linear regression model was used to assess significance of lameness, overall severity of bone lesions and overall severity of soft tissue le- sions on time to return to performance. Regression models and Pearson correlations were performed using Statistical Analyses Software (SAS). Results There were 32 total horses evaluated consisting of 20 right forelimbs and 24 left forelimbs (12 bilateral studies). Four horses had an MRI performed for bi- lateral forelimb lameness, while the remaining eight bilateral studies were performed for comparison purposes. The most frequent lameness score on presentation was a Grade 2/5, range 1-3. The mean age for all horses include 3.9 \u00b1 0.3 years, range 3-7 years, and the mean duration of lameness until MRI diagnosis was 7 \u00b1 2 weeks, range 1-22 weeks. The left forelimb was the primary lame limb in 17 horses, and the right forelimb was considered the primary lame limb for 15 horses. Follow-up data was available for 30 horses out of the total 32 horses included in the study. A total of 22 out of 30 horses successfully returned to competition with 14 horses returning within 6 months and 8 additional horses returning within 12 months. No additional horses returned to competition between 12 and 24 month post-injury; five out of the eight horses that did not return to competition were retired following injury and three never successfully competed in the cut- ting discipline. The mean time to return to competi- tion was 157 \u00b1 38.2 days, range 22-345 days. Conclusion A variety of pathologic processes in the tarsus and proximal metatarsus can contribute to lameness. Horses with lameness with diagnos- tic analgesia of the proximal metatarsus may have pathologic changes in the tarsus greater than that of the metatarsus.References 1. Jackman, B.R.

Introduction Early articular cartilage injury occurs with depletion of glycosaminoglycans in the extracellular matrix and is challenging to detect using currently avail- able imaging technologies.2 Contrast-enhanced computed tomography is a technique where con- trast media is administered to highlight articular car- tilage. Conventional agents are anionic or non-ionic and have limited diffusion into articular cartilage. A cationic contrast agent (CA4+) was developed that has a higher affinity for articular cartilage.3 However, due to the different biochemical constituent propor- tions across species, it is unknown how the diffusion of CA4+ courses through and equilibrates in equine articular cartilage. Also, the ability for cationic con- trast-enhanced CT to predict the biochemical and biomechanical properties of articular cartilage is unknown. We hypothesized that articular cartilage volume will influence CA4+ diffusion characteristics and that cationic CECT attenuation will correlate with GAG content and compressive modulus across a range of articular cartilage degradation. Methods Diffusion trajectory of CA4+ Osteochondral specimens from the femoral con- dyles of a 3-year-old horse were collected and vi- sually inspected to ensure no surface erosion was present. The plugs were placed into a custom fixture and submerged in CA4+ (8 mg I/mL). Sequential mi- cro CT scans were performed at multiple time points ranging from baseline to 24 hours of submersion. CT images were analyzed by segmenting the articu- lar cartilage from the subchondral bone and the CT attenuation quantified. Comparisons over time were made and fit to a nonlinear least square regression equation to determine equilibration time.4 Cationic CECT characteristics of normal and degenerative equine articular cartilage Under approval of the animal care and use commit- tee at CSU, a 4 year old horse had three articular cartilage defects created on the femoral trochlea (defect joint) and the contralateral femoropatellar joint surface was examined arthroscopically to en- sure macroscopically normal articular cartilage (con- trol joint). Forty-seven days after surgery the horse was euthanized and osteochondral biopsies were collected along the surface, excluding the defect ar- eas. After each plug was removed, it was assigned a macroscopic (Outerbridge) score.5 Plugs with sufficient geometry were put in a mechanical test- ing system (BOSE, Eden Prairie, MN) and tested in unconfined compression to determine equilibrium compressive modulus. After mechanical testing, the plug was equilibrated in CA4+ for 24 hours and im- aged with micro CT. The plug was washed to remove residual CA4+ and a portion of articular cartilage re- moved and analyzed with a dimethylmethylene blue assay to quantify GAG content.6 The remainder of articular cartilage attached to bone was processed for histology and stained using safranin-O fast green to depict GAG distributions within the tissue. Com- parisons between outcome parameters and statisti- cal significance was defined as P<0.05. Results Diffusion trajectory of CA4+ The diffusion course progressed radially from the edges of the plugs (Figure 1).

Conclusions Equine articular cartilage volume and anatomic location influence the CA4+ diffusion profile and time to reach equilibrium. Cationic CECT imaging is predictive of GAG concentrations and biomechan- ical properties and also reflects GAG distributions observed on histologic analysis. Cationic CECT has potential as a non-destructive imaging strategy to provide information on the biochemical, mechanical and histological properties of normal and degenera- tive articular cartilage.

In- dividual radiographic localization of each tendon and ligament of the stifle has not been previously reported or demonstrated in multiple radiographic projections. Introduction Radiographs, traditionally, are the most logical tech- nique in evaluating and assessing the bony struc- tures of the stifle. Other techniques can be used, but might be costly, or might be limited due to the anat- omy of the equine stifle. Although radiographs can- not reveal lesions in the soft tissues, many of these injuries involve the origins and insertions of the soft tissues and may be accompanied by radiographic changes at these sites. Increased knowledge of entheses will allow clini- cians to extract vital information about soft tissue injuries from radiographs. The objective of this study was to produce a series of radiographs with each enthesis identified separately in 4 different projections. The optimal projections were identified for each structure and the radiographic landmarks were marked. Methods The location of all entheses were determined by gross dissection. The proximal tibia and fibula, distal femur, patella and menisci were isolated from one horse and used as a template. A series of 4 radio- graphs was obtained with each enthesis identified with barium paste. The radiographic landmarks for each enthesis were described and the best projec- tion(s) for evaluation of each structure of interest identified.Results A complete series of radiographs outlining the en- theses was created to serve as a guide for radio- graph interpretation. Based on the evaluation of all images, the oblique was found to be the most useful in evaluating the cranial cruciate origin and it is also of value in the assessment of injuries to the medial patellar ligament. Conclusion Unlike a previous study done which highlights the close overlap of some of the entheses within the stifle, the current study reports the structures indi- vidually to avoid overlap. This information will valu- able for evaluating radiographs of the equine stifle, particularly in cases where avulsion and enthesopa- thy exists, although its use is also limited by several factors. This study is meant to provide clinicians with a de- scriptive reference of the soft tissue structures in the stifle. It includes the extensor and popliteal ten- dons and the patellar, meniscotibial, collateral, and cruciate ligaments. References 1. Aldrich Monahan MK, JD, Valdes-Martinez evj. ahead of print]. 2.

With a limited ability to heal, early detec- tion of cartilage injury is important to prevent pro- gressive deterioration; however, current strategies are unable to provide early detection. Quantitative evaluation using CT and MRI will provide an oppor- tunity to improve diagnostic evaluation of articular cartilage in horses. Introduction Osteoarthritis is defined as a progressive deteriora- tion of articular cartilage.2 The progressive nature of the disease is due to the inability for articular carti- lage to regenerate once the degradation process is initiated. Thus, early detection of articular cartilage injury is important for improving patient outcomes. Despite the need, early detection of articular carti- lage with CT and MRI is limited. This article summa- rizes the compositional and physiological attributes of articular cartilage in horses and connects how those attributes can be imaged using CT and MRI, both morphologically and quantitatively. Results Articular cartilage is composed of an extracellular matrix made up of mostly water, followed by colla- gen and proteoglycans (glycosaminoglycans). The heterogeneous distribution of these constituents varies throughout tissue depth. Glycosaminogly- cans (GAGs) have a negative charge, which attracts water affording compressive stiffness during load- ing, while at the articular surface.Computed tomography Articular cartilage is not visible on CT but once con- trast media is administered, it diffuses into the tissue and becomes apparent. Morphological assessments including surface topography and articular carti- lage thickness can be characterized. Based on the amount of contrast media that diffuses and equili- brates in articular cartilage, the resultant CT attenu- ation can be measured using commercial software. The characteristics of the contrast media used will dictate its affinity for articular cartilage.3 Most con- trast media are neutral or negatively charged. As such, the contrast media is repelled from the neg- atively charged GAGs. Cationic CT based contrast media has been developed by our collaboration with Dr. Mark Grinstaff's laboratory at Boston Univer- sity. The cationic contrast media is electrostatically attracted to GAGs improving the diffusion into the tissue, the amount of which is quantified (Figure 1).4-8 Magnetic resonance imaging Through a different process, MRI is valuable to as- sess articular cartilage. MRI capitalizes on the prop- erties of hydrogen and since articular cartilage has a high water content, it is a tissue that is readily im- aged with MRI. Similar to CT, surface morphometry and articular cartilage thickness can be measured thereby being a technique capable of detecting par- tial cartilage erosion.9 However, this is a late stage manifestation of articular cartilage degradation. Be- cause of the lack of early detection with morpholog- ic sequences, quantitative strategies for MRI have been developed to detect early biochemical alter- ations in the tissue. Delayed gadolinium enhanced MRI of cartilage (dGEMRIC) is a quantitative tech- nique that uses a gadolinium-based contrast media that diffuses into articular cartilage (Table 1).10 Sim-Recent advances in articular cartilage evaluation using computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging This is a summary of an article by Drs.

The quantification of this imaging signal then can indirectly estimate GAG concentrations, nonde- structively. T1rho is a quantitative method that also estimates GAG content, but without the requirement of contrast media.11 T2 mapping is another quanti- tative MRI technique that correlates with collagen content.10,11 Diffusion imaging techniques can es- timate water diffusion. Most of these quantitative techniques are rarely explored in horses. Conclusions CT and MRI are widely used diagnostic techniques in horses. Improvements in technology, contrast me- dia and access to developed quantitative imaging techniques used in humans are becoming increas- ingly available for horses and translational research. An understanding of these methods will increase awareness and offer substantial opportunities to im- prove our detection of early articular cartilage injury.

Introduction The identification of factors associated with lame- ness could be one method to decrease lameness incidence and prolong the competitive life of the equine athlete. The objectives were to determine if there is an association between sagittal plane hoof balance and hindlimb lameness. Materials and Methods Eighty client-owned horses with hindlimb lame- ness localized with regional anesthesia (cases) and eighty horses with no detectable hindlimb lameness (controls) were prospectively enrolled. Lameness cases were categorized by location (stifle, tarsus, proximal metatarsus, and other sites). Lateromedi- al radiographs were performed of hind hooves and (PADP) determined. Mean PADPs were calculated. Logistic and linear regression were used to analyze PADPs. Odds ratios were calculated. Significance set at P<0.05.Results Mean PADP was significantly less in cases than controls. Mean PADP was significantly less in hors- es with lameness localized to tarsus and proximal suspensory, but not the stifle. Lame horses were 3.8 times more likely to have a negative/neutral PADP. Lameness localized to the tarsus and proximal sus- pensory were 5 and 5.2 times more likely to have a negative/neutral PADP. Discussion It is unknown whether the negative/neutral PADP contribute to lameness or lameness resulted in low- er PADP. Corrective farriery to improve PADP may be investigated as one component in the prevention or treatment of hindlimb lameness localized to re- gions proximal to the foot. References 1.

It also sum- marizes the current state-of-the-art uses and high- lights potential applications of contrast-enhanced CT and MRI for assessment of diseased or injured equine tissues. Introduction Conventional CT and MRI techniques are often lim- ited in their ability to distinguish one tissue from an adjacent one. Thus, contrast media are admin- istered to improve identification and evaluation of tissues.2,3 After contrast media administration, these techniques are denoted as contrast-enhanced CT and MRI. While the contrast media used in horses are manufactured for human use and generally con- sidered safe, they are not devoid of risk and there are few detailed descriptions in horses. Since there is a paucity of data reporting in horses, this article drew from experiences in other species, in order to raise awareness of potential risks that may occur. This review describes the different contrast media available, reported techniques, adverse events and opportunities for their use in horses and then high- lights the potential advantages and possibilities that are enabled by use of contrast-enhanced CT or MRI. Results Computed tomography contrast media Iodinated contrast media are most commonly used in CT because of the high attenuation that occurs in the presence of x-rays. There are numerous com- mercially available solutions that exhibit different chemical structures, ionicity, osmolality and viscos- ity. Though usually safe, consideration of potential adverse events should be made: (1) Assessment of risk vs benefit, (2) consideration of alternative imag- ing strategies that would achieve the same clinical goals, and (3) valid clinical indication for administra- tion.4 CT-based contrast media intrasynovially, and intra- thecally. Each route of administration has applicable details regarding imaging acquisition settings, con- trast medium concentration and delivery properties that must be understood to maximize image quality, while avoiding unnecessary risk to the patient. In- trasynovial deposition highlights the articular carti- lage surface, thereby enabling surface characteriza- tion. Intrathecal administration can highlight spinal cord compression and the volumetric nature of the technology permits evaluation in multiple planes (Figure 1).Use of contrast media in computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in horses: techniques, adverse events and opportunities This is a summary of an article by Drs.

They range from minor reactions requiring no medical intervention to severe and life-threatening.5,6 Some potential ad- ministration complications include air embolization and extravasation. While air embolization has the potential to be fatal, local inflammation secondary to extravasation is more common and quickly resolves. Acute adverse events are allergic-like or physiologi- cal. In general, acute adverse events are reduced by ~80% in humans when using low osmolar instead of high osmolar iodinated contrast media. Severe reac- tions in humans are unpredictable and seem to oc- cur with similar frequency using ionic and non-ionic formulations. Delayed adverse events in horses most commonly appear to manifest has hyperther- mia and most self-resolve without treatment after in- trathecal administration. Adverse events during and after myelography can include seizures, worsening neurological signs and prolonged anesthetic recov- ery. High osmolar contrast media are contra-indicat- ed in horses because of severe adverse events and high fatality.7 Magnetic resonance imaging contrast media Most contrast media used in clinical practice are complexed with gadolinium. Free gadolinium is toxic to tissue, but when chelated is considered to have a much higher safety profile. Gadolinium short- ens T1 and T2 relaxation times on MRI and contrast media are classified as to how they concentrate in tissues - pool in the extracellular fluid, blood, or in the liver. As opposed to CT contrast media, the chelate structure is more important than ionicity, osmolality and viscosity. Administration routes used in horses consist of intravenous and intrasynovial;8 however, intra-arterial and intrathecal administration is reported in humans. Articular cartilage is a tissue that permits gadolinium contrast diffusion and provides improved discrimi- nation from the synovial space and subchondral bone (Figure 2). It is denoted as gadolinium en- hanced MRI of cartilage (dGEMRIC).9Adverse events are minimally reported in horses and consist of mild and transient hypotension.10 However, in humans, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis is a rare and potentially fatal complication and even so, gadolinium deposits have been found in tissues decades after administration in humans. Horses with renal insufficiency or dehydration should be identi- fied prior to systemic administration of gadolinium. Conclusions Contrast media use in CT and MRI is relatively in its infancy compared to the databases built in human medicine. The diversity of applications of its use enable equine clinicians to more comprehensive- ly evaluate orthopedic tissues, while also ensuring minimal chances for adverse events to occur. Rec- ognizing these limitations will expand our diagnostic capabilities and advancement of characterizing dis- ease states in horses.

ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH CENTERRESEARCH | FOCUS 3 - Improvement in the Understanding of the Pathogenesis of Exercise-Induced Traumatic Disease Take home message The rate of musculoskeletal injuries during a race, (0.72/1,000) starts in New Zealand was lower than the rates reported for other racing jurisdictions. The condition of the track and the distance of the race was associated with the rate of musculoskeletal in- jury during a race. Introduction Over the last few decades, numerous epidemiologic studies have focused on quantifying the incidence rate and risk factors for non-fatal and fatal race-day injuries in Thoroughbred racehorses worldwide. In- ternationally the incidence of fatalities ranges from 0.4/1000 starts2 to 1-1.9/1000 starts3 and the inci- dence of musculoskeletal injuries (MSI) reported on race day ranges per thousand starts4 4.5/1000 starts.5 Previous studies have reported the incident rates and risk factors for MSI occurring during training in New Zealand;6,7 however, no studies have investi- gated the instances of musculoskeletal events oc- curring on race day during flat races in New Zea- land. A previous study reported a failure of a finish rate of 2.8/1000 starts within flat racing in New Zea- land.8 Failure to finish represented a broad category of events (pulled up/fall/lost rider) that included MSI, which prevented a horse from completing the race. Methods A retrospective study was conducted from using data from all Thoroughbred flat race starts in New Zealand between August 1st, 2005 and July 31st, 2011 (6 racing seasons). The study utilized data from a previous study describing the broad failure to fin- ish events (pulled up/fall/lost rider).8 Briefly Stipendi- ary Steward's reports and race data were provided by New Zealand Thoroughbred Racing (NZTR) Race data was provided in a Microsoft excel file and in- cluded, race date, race track, age, horse gender, fin- ishing position in race (used to identify horses that failed to finish), barrier draw, (positions in the start- ing gates), carded weight (weight allocated by race handicapper) carried weight (any apprentice weight allowances) in domestic rating (analogous to the of- ficial rating system). Results During the six racing seasons, there were 188,616 race starts for 16,646 individual horses. There were 544 failed to finish events, of which 177 (33%) were classed as veterinary events and 48% (85/177) of these were fatalities. Of the veterinary events re- ported, 136 (77%) were due to MSI and 41 (23%) were cardiac and respiratory events. The incidence of MSI on race day was 0.72 per 1000 starts, whilst the incidence of cardiac and respiratory events was 0.21 per 1000 starts. Of the MSI events, 91 (67%) were reported as frac- tures, 10 (7%) were reported tendon or ligament inju- ries, 10 (7%) were reported as lameness, and 7 (5%) were reported as soft tissue injuries; 18 (13%) MSI events were undefined. Only one horse had multi- ple veterinary events (n = 2), of which one was lame- ness and one was tendon and ligament. The inci- dence of fractures, tendon or ligament injuries, and lameness, and soft tissue injuries was 0.48, 0.05, and 0.04 per 1000 starts, respectively. Of the MSI events 75 (55%) were forelimb, 33 (22%) were hind- limb, 1 (1%) was both fore and hindlimb, 9 (7%) were pelvic and 19 (14%) were non-defined. A total of 57% (78/136) of MSI were fatalities, whilst 81% (72/89) of fractures were fatalities. The incidence rate for race- day MSI fatalities was 0.41 per 1000 starts.Epidemiology of musculoskeletal injury during racing on New Zealand racetracks 2005-2011 This is a summary of a paper authored by Drs. Charlotte Bolwell, Chris Rogers, Erica Gee and Wayne McIlwraith published in animals in 20171 2017-18 REPORT 175RESEARCH | FOCUS 3 - Improvement in the Understanding of the Pathogenesis of Exercise-Induced Traumatic Disease Over half of the cardiac and respiratory events were recorded as epistaxis (23/41; 56%), five were record- ed as atrial fibrillation, five were recorded as fatal haemorrhage, four were recorded as elevated heart rate, three events were recorded as ruptured aorta, and one event was recorded as respiratory distress. A total of seven (17%) cardiac and respiratory events were recorded as fatal. Season, track condition, race distance, and weight carried were associated with MSI at p < 0.20 and were included in the multi- variable model. The results of the multivariable Poisson regression model of variables significantly associated with MSI are presented in Table 3. Race distance and track condition were significantly associated with MSI. Af- ter adjusting for race distance, the rate of MSI was significantly lower on 'dead' and 'slow' tracks com- pared with 'good' tracks. After adjusting for track condition, the rate of MSI was significantly greater for horses in longer races (1671 m) compared with horses in races of 1200 m (Table 2). There were no significant interactions in the final model. The Pear- son goodness of fit statistic for the final model was p = 0.56, indicating no evidence of poor model fit.Discussion This is the first study to report on the incidence of failure to finish a race due to MSI in flat races in New Zealand and provide an assessment of the risk factors for MSI during a race. The incidence of MSI during flat races in New Zealand appears to be low when compared with international data. Recent work from the U.K. reported a race-day MSI incidence of 2.1 per 1000 starts,4 whilst Cohen and others5 reported a MSI rate of 4.1 per 1000 starts in Kentucky. Similarly, the rate of MSI fatalities during a race was lower than that previously reported in the USA (1.9 per 1000 starts) and the U.K. (0.7 per 1000 starts).4 It is unlikely that the incidence of MSI during a race was underestimated in this study, as failure to finish a race represents a key event that prevented a horse from completing the race, which was subse- quently recorded on official race-day records. Due to the nature of the recording pre-2011 (when the RIU was established) it is possible that the rate of fa- talities may be underestimated in the current study. However, the rate of fatalities reported in this study was the same as that previously reported in a study of race-day fatalities in Victoria, Australia, a racing jurisdiction with similar structures and levels of re- porting as found in New Zealand.Table 1.

It may that the trainers' perception of the horse's ability and soundness to trial and race, with trainer deciding to retire a horse rather than continue to train and race it. Therefore, it is possible that the flat racing population of horses in New Zealand may be likened to the previously described \"healthy horse effect\" or survival bias and the lower rates of MSI observed during races. Sim- ilarly, many studies have reported associations be- tween exercise distances accumulated in training, prior racing history and time between races, and the risk of MSI and fatalities in training and racing. How- ever, these relationships are known to be complex and are likely to vary with different case definitions investigated. Training data were not available for the cohort of horses used in the current study but further work to address the relationship between exercise history and the rates of MSI during racing is required. In addition to potential differences in training and racing schedule, the track surface used for races in New Zealand compared to other racing jurisdictions may explain the low rate of MSI observed in this study. Racing in New Zealand is conducted on grass tracks, whereas races in the USA are most common- ly run on dirt tracks, which have higher rates of in- juries compared to synthetic tracks. However, given that the rates of injuries on turf tracks in the USA are higher than those reported for synthetic tracks, it is likely that other factors in addition to track surface contribute to the higher rates observed internation- ally. Differences in the rules of racing, for example, permit the use of therapeutic medications in the USA, and the structure and type of racing across racing jurisdictions may also contribute to the vari- ation in rates reported worldwide. Given this, there is a need for a collaborative approach to determine regional similarities or differences that contribute to the rate of racing MSI. Only two exposure variables were found to be asso- ciated with the incidence of MSI during a race in the multivariable modelling. Longer race distances were found to be a risk factor for MSI, in agreement with results of studies investigating racing fractures and fatalities. An Australian study reported increased odds of racing fatalities, of which most were due to MSI, for every additional furlong raced. The authors of that study suggested the increased risk was like- ly due to increased exposure time for an injury to occur, and the possibility of more fatigued horses in longer races. The race distances in Australia are similar to those of New Zealand, with a maximum distance of between 3200-3600 m. The results showed a lower risk of MSI on \"dead\" and \"slow\" tracks when compared with races run on \"good\" tracks.

This may explain the low number of fast tracks observed in this dataset, which may have been a contributor to the apparent inability of the present study to iden- tify fast tracks as a risk factor for MSI despite most of the MSI being due to fracture. The avoidance of the harder, less compliant track conditions rated as \"fast\" by New Zealand track managers is of interest and the drivers behind this decision require further examination. Most of the MSI veterinary events in this study were reported as fractures, with smaller numbers of ten- don and ligament and lameness and soft tissue injuries reported. A previous study reported 42% and 41% of retirements from racing in New Zealand were due to fracture or tendon injuries, respectively. However, Perkins et al. included injuries occurring in training making direct comparisons with the re- sults of this study difficult. In 2011, the RIU took over the monitoring and management of the Stipendiary Steward's reports in New Zealand. References 1. Bolwell C., Rogers C.G.E., McIlwraith C.W.

Introduction Laminitis is a debilitating disease in horses and com- monly results in severe pain, lameness, and loss of athletic performance.2 The economic and welfare impacts of laminitis are high because of the associ- ated poor prognosis, severe pain, and frequency of recurrence. Furthermore, the estimated incidence of laminitis ranges from 1.5% to 34% with an esti- mated lifetime risk of 15%.Recognizing the impact of laminitis on horses and horse owners, veterinarians desire an improved understanding of laminitis, as evidenced in a 2009 survey conducted by the AAEP in which its members identified laminitis as the high- est priority for research funding and investigation. In the National Animal Health Monitoring System equine study performed in 2000, horse owners in the United States reported that pasture-associated laminitis and laminitis of unknown etiology were the most common forms of laminitis. Previous cohort studies have identified some risk factors (e.g., hy- perinsulinemia) for PEAL in ponies, and experimen- tal euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp studies have been shown to induce laminitis in ponies and hors- es. However, the importance of these and other risk factors for naturally occurring PEAL has not been characterized among North American horses. Nota- ble efforts have been made in the past decade to further the profession's understanding of this com- plex condition; however, much of the research on laminitis has been limited to the study of mechanis- tic pathways following experimental induction of the condition. Although valuable, experimental models may not fully replicate the multifactorial interactions underlying naturally occurring laminitis. Thus, obser- vational studies of naturally occurring laminitis are necessary to advance our knowledge and under- standing of the condition and associated risk fac- tors as well as to design future investigations for its prevention and control. The objective of the study reported here was to investigate risk factors for the development of PEAL in horses and ponies in North America. It was the result of the AAEP Foundation to commission a task force to investigate ways that we could use our members to gather clinical data rather than using research models for further understand- ing of factors contributing to laminitis. Methods Case selection The study was designed as a matched, case-con- trol study in which participating veterinarians were asked to identify case-control sets that consisted of 1 horse with PEAL (cases) and 2 control horses with- out laminitis. Cases were defined as incident cas- es of PEAL with clinical signs detected 4 weeks prior to examination and collection of survey data (the time-frame for detection of clinical signs was extended from the initial requirement of 48 hours after detection). In addition, case horses were re- quired to have evidence of bilateral forelimb lame- ness of Obel grade 2 and at least 2 of the follow- ing findings: sensitivity to hoof testers greatest in the region of the toe at the time of initial examina- tion, a characteristic foundered stance, radiologic evidence of laminar thickening, and postmortem evidence (gross or microscopic) of laminitis. Horses were excluded as PEAL cases if they had any of the following findings: previous history of laminitis or navicular disease; laminitis associated with sepsis, a non-weight-bearing lameness, or excessive grain Case-control study of risk factors for pasture- and endocrinopathy- associated laminitis in North American horses This presents the results of a study authored by a special task force that designed this case controlled clinical study.

Control selection For each PEAL case, at least 1 horse from each of 2 control populations, healthy controls and lame- ness controls, was identified. A healthy control was defined as any healthy horse residing at a different farm than that of the PEAL case and ideally the next horse examined by the veterinarian for a routine wellness examination (e.g., vaccination, Coggins testing, health certificate completion, or routine den- tal examination). A lameness control was defined as any horse with lameness in only 1 forelimb and residing at a different farm than the PEAL case. To qualify as a lameness control, the horse's lameness must have been present for 4 weeks and must have been graded as 3 according to the AAEP's 5-point lameness grading scale.16 Horses were ex- cluded from the control groups if they had a histo- ry of laminitis or had clinical or diagnostic findings indicative of previous laminitis (e.g., divergent hoof rings, dorsal hoof dishing, or preexisting radiologic evidence consistent with laminitis, such as rotation of the third phalanx relative to the hoof wall). And a prior sample size estimation indicated that ap- proximately 200 PEAL cases and 400 controls were required on the basis of a significance level of 5%, statistical power of 80%, an OR of 2 for PEAL cases relative to controls, and 2 controls/PEAL case. Results A total of 199 horses with PEAL that were each matched with at least 1 healthy control (n = 198) or lameness control (153) horse were included in the analysis.

Age was known and reported for 547 horses, with an age range of 1 to 34 years, a mean of 13.3 years, and a median of 13 years. Neither sex nor age was a risk factor for development of laminitis. Breeds included Quarter Horses, American Paint Horses, and Appa- loosas combined (n = 237 [43%]); Thoroughbreds (70 [13%]); draft horses and European warmbloods combined (66 [12%]); Arabians (48 [9%]); gaited hors- and Sad- dlebreds (36 [7%]); ponies and miniature horses (29 [5%]); and Morgans (17 [3%]). Breed was not report- ed for 8 (1%) horses and was reported as other for 39 (7%) horses. The severity of lameness for each of the 199 horses with PEAL was assessed with the Obel grading system (grade 2, n = 121 [61%] horses; grade 3, 62 [31%]; and grade 4, 16 [8%]) The final multivariable CLR model comparing data between case horses and healthy control horses indicat- ed that horses with an overweight body condition (BCS 7), generalized or regional adiposity (alone or in combination), or a preexisting endocrinopathy, along with horses that did not receive concentrates in their diet, had higher odds of developing PEAL. Horses that had received corticosteroids within the 30 days prior to examination were more likely to de- velop PEAL (OR, 5.65; 95% CI, 1.32 to 24.27) than were horses that had not received corticosteroid treatment within the 30 days prior to examination. However, corticosteroid administration within that timeframe was uncommon in all groups of horses (case horses, n = 12/198 [6%]; healthy control horses, 4/198 [2%]; and lameness control horses, 1/151 [1%]) for which this variable was reported.

Horses that had received corticoste- roids within the 30 days prior to examination were more likely to develop PEAL (OR, 5.65; 95% CI, 1.32 to 24.27) than were horses that had not received corticosteroid treatment within the 30 days prior to examination. However, corticosteroid administration within that timeframe was uncommon in all groups of horses (case horses, n = 12/198 [6%]; healthy con- trol horses, 4/198 [2%]; and lameness control horses, 1/151 [1%]) for which this variable was reported. Discussion The final multivariable CLR model comparing data for case horses and lameness control horses yield- ed similar results, with PEAL more likely in horses with an overweight body condition (BCS 7), gen- eralized or regional adiposity (alone or in combina- tion), or a preexisting endocrinopathy. There were no substantial bivariable interactions between any pairs of variables in either model. To our knowledge, the present study represents the first reported ob- servational study of veterinarian-diagnosed incident cases of PEAL in North America. The use of incident cases in the present study was crucially important because identified risk factors were more likely to have been causal, whereas studies of prevalent cas- es identify factors that might be causal or that might be associated with surviving with the disease or re- currence of it. Therefore, the risk factors for PEAL identified in the present study may assist not only in managing and preventing this form of laminitis, but also in guiding future research into its pathogenesis. Results of the present study of incident cases of PEAL supported the causal association of obesity and laminitis because the obesity preceded the onset of laminitis. This strong association indicated that the risk of laminitis might be reduced by controlling obesity or modifying the underlying determinants of obesity. Careful feeding and management practices aimed at reducing body weight and adiposity should be considered. Although this concept is not new,3 results of the present study contributed evidence of the association of body morphometrics with the odds of developing laminitis and should be compelling information for convincing veterinarians and horse owners of the risks that obesity and increased adiposity pose relative to laminitis. In human medicine, causes of obesity not associated with increased caloric intake or decreased energy expenditure have been identified, resulting in novel methods of obesity control and prevention.4,5 Similarly and as noted previously, additional strategies other than dietary management and exercise might be needed in some cases to prevent obesity in horses. Endocrinopathies in this population was surprising, but may have resulted from reporting bias (e.g., un- certainty regarding medical history prior to evalu- ations for laminitis or variability in interpreting the questionnaire and whether further diagnostic test- ing was warranted before a horse was considered to have an endocrinopathy). More importantly, it was possible that laminitis might have been the first clin- ical sign of an endocrinopathy recognized by horse owners or veterinarians. These findings indicated that early recognition of endocrinopathies is vital Figure 3. Seasonal distribution for the onset of clinical signs associated with PEAL as reported for 196 of the 199 (98%) case horses for the study in Figure 1. Horses were significantly (P < 0.001) more likely to develop laminitis in the spring or summer, compared with the fall or winter. 2017-18 REPORT 183RESEARCH | FOCUS 3 - Improvement in the Understanding of the Pathogenesis of Exercise-Induced Traumatic Disease to allow earlier intervention with medical treatment or husbandry management strategies to reduce the likelihood of affected horses developing PEAL. Corticosteroid administration to horses has been implicated as inducing laminitis; however, no direct evidence of a causal association has been identi- fied. Although the use of corticosteroids in horses is widespread, the incidence of corticosteroid-in- duced laminitis was low in an observational study investigating risk factors for development of lamini- tis and in experimental studies of disease. Although the multivariable model comparing PEAL cases to healthy controls in the present study yielded a 13- fold greater odds of PEAL among horses that had received corticosteroids within the 30 days prior to examination relative to horses that had not, the validity and magnitude of this association must be considered with caution. Prior corticosteroid use did not remain in the final multivariable model compar- ing PEAL cases to lameness no controls, suggesting that the association observed with healthy controls could have been confounded by another variable. More importantly, corticosteroid administration was uncommon in all groups of horses, and the small numbers rendered our estimates of the magnitude of an effect unstable, as reflected in the wide 95% CI. In addition, respondents' recall of corticosteroid administration may have been greater for horses with laminitis than for horses in the control groups, creating a potential for marked recall bias. Never- theless, the authors believe that the results of the present study indicated that this topic merits further investigation through a well-designed, large-scale, hypothesis-driven observational study. Finally, as with any epidemiological study, the ef- fects of confounding were considered. Cases and controls were matched on the basis of input from responding veterinarians in an effort to control for confounding on this variable. Bias introduced by measured variables were accounted for in the multi-variable model; however, the association with PEAL may have been confounded by other factors that were not measured or considered.In conclusion, the present observational study re- vealed several important risk factors that might con- tribute to the development of PEAL. A strategy to reduce the incidence of PEAL could involve further elucidating the determinants, identifying risk factors that are modifiable by medical management or hus- bandry changes, and educating horse owners and veterinarians about these factors and interventions. In addition to continued investigation of screening tests, treatments, and other interventions that can ameliorate insulin dysregulation and obesity, stud- ies are warranted to identify determinants of obesity and adiposity as well as interventions for modifiable risk factors. It is also plausible that earlier recogni- tion and treatment of endocrinopathies might con- tribute to reducing the incidence of the devastating disease of laminitis. References 1.

The aim of this study is to characterize the damage accumu- lation behavior of the spinal dura mater under uni- axial loading. Methods Longitudinal (i.e. cranial-to-caudal samples of ovine cervical dura mater were ten- at one of three strain rates (qua- si-static, 0.05/sec, and 0.3/sec) (Figure 1). The re- sulting stress-strain data were fit to a hyperelastic continuum damage model to characterize the strain- rate dependent sub-failure and failure behavior. The constitutive damage model is a piece-wise function with separate terms representing damage to the collagen fibers and to the matrix.1Results The constitutive model fit the data well, with errors of 1.5%, 3%, and 6% for the 0.3/sec, 0.05/sec, and quasistatic strain rates, respectively (Figure 2). Sig- nificant differences in several model parameters demonstrates that the damage behavior of the fi- brous and matrix components of the dura mater are strain-rate dependent. Specifically, fiber stiffness and nonlinearity were increased at higher strain rates. Additionally, at higher strain rates, the initia- tion to matrix damage was delayed and the tissue exhibited greater ductility and held more strain en- ergy before failure. Conclusions The results show distinct damage behaviors for the matrix and fiber constituents, and that the damage Figure 2: Representative experimental stretch-stress curves (colored symbols) from each strain-rate group demonstrate the elastic non-linearity that is characteristic of hydrated fibrous soft tissues.

The subchondral bone is highly adaptable, with the ability to model and remodel in response to loading stresses experienced by the joint. Re- petitive stress injuries within the joint can result in primary or secondary pathologic lesions within the subchondral bone, which have been recognized to contribute to the development and progression of osteoarthritis. Recent advances in diagnostic imag- ing, particularly volumetric imaging modalities have facilitated earlier identification of subchondral bone disease. Despite these advancements, limitations in our knowledge about subchondral bone makes treatment and prevention of these conditions chal- lenging. The purpose of the report is to review our current understanding of subchondral bone and its relationship to osteoarthritis across veterinary spe- cies, with a specific focus on the research that has been performed in horses. It can be concluded that our current understanding of subchondral bone is advancing, and future experimental, clinical and pathologic studies will provide additional insight about subchondral bone and its relationship to joint disease. Introduction As our understanding of the underlying pathophys- iology of osteoarthritis grows, we have begun to recognize that osteoarthritis is a disease of not just articular cartilage, but of the osteochondral unit. The osteochondral unit is composed of articular car- tilage, calcified cartilage, and subchondral and tra- becular bone, which work synergistically to support functional loading of the joint. Subchondral bone has received particular attention in recent years, as derangements in this essential tissue have been rec- ognized for its contribution to the development and progression of osteoarthritis. This review discusses the anatomy, physiology, and biomechanical princi- ples that guide subchondral bone function; and then delves into the specific conditions of subchondral bone, specifically subchondral bone disease, re- petitive stress injury and chronic fatigue injury. The review concludes with some general principles of diagnosis and a brief discussion of treatment and prevention strategies. Conclusion Substantial insight has been gained about the bio- mechanical influences of the joint on the subchon- dral bone, with the relationship between subchon- dral bone injury and articular cartilage loss and the development of degenerative joint disease only beginning to be elucidated. Continued investiga- tion of the adaptive and maladaptive changes within the subchondral bone by researchers and clinicians alike will continue to yield valuable information about the behavior of this unique component of the joint. Further discovery of the delicate balance of factors that maintain the integrity of the subchondral bone and homeostasis within the joint will surely en- hance and direct our understanding of subchondral bone disease in across both veterinary and human patients.

Also, the stand- ing needle arthroscopic surgical technique to col- lect articular cartilage and synovial membrane tissue enabled a feasible method capable of eval- uating of intra-articular therapies without requiring horse sacrifice. Introduction Synovitis is a critical component of equine joint dis- ease. Experimental synovitis models, including the injection of recombinant interleukin 1 beta (reIL-1), induce transient disease and are used to investigate new joint therapies.2 However, synovitis models have not been described in the tarsocrural joint. While these models have potential to be non-ter- minal, there are no descriptions of standing tech- niques to harvest articular tissues, which are im- portant for evaluating disease-modifying effects of emerging joint therapies. An 18-gauge arthroscope has been used for diagnostic stifle evaluation in standing horses.3 This technique was well tolerated and avoided a postoperative convalescence peri- od. Therefore, we developed a technique using this needle arthroscope to collect articular cartilage and synovium samples to improve the breadth of joint tissue evaluation without requiring general anesthe- sia or horse sacrifice. The aims of the study were to determine subjective and objective pain parameters in the reIL-1 synovi- tis model and to describe the surgical biopsy tech- nique, including the location and quantity of tissues obtained. Methods The institutional animal care and use committee at CSU approved the protocols for this non-terminal study of 24 horses aged 4 to 10 years. The reIL-1 (50 ng) was injected into a randomly assigned tar- socrural (synovitis) joint. The contralateral (control) joint was injected with the same volume of PBS.

Only results from joints unexposed to the treatments are reported in this publication. Results of the therapeutic are reported elsewhere.4 Data collection time points were established at baseline and then 4 hours, 10 hours and 24 hours af- ter induction of synovitis (or controls)(Figure 1). Joint effusion was graded subjectively on a 0-4 scale (0 = none, 4 = severe) and lameness assessments were performed using a force platform (Bertec Corp.), in- ertial sensor system (Equinosis Q) and subjective assessment (AAEP scale) from a blinded investiga- tor.5,6 After lameness evaluation, synovial fluid was collected, and the amount harvested was recorded. Synovial fluid was to be analyzed for prostaglandin E2 and glycosaminoglycan concentrations and cy- tologic profiles. Arthroscopic biopsies were collected using an 18- ga arthroscope (Biovision Tech.) and Ferris Smith rongeurs (Figure 2). Horses were sedated, the tarsal region anesthetized using a peroneal tibial nerve block and placed in standing stocks in preparation for aseptic surgery. Samples of articular cartilage from the medial malleolus of the tibia (2, each 3 mm2) were harvested and analyzed for chondrocyte via- bility and mRNA expression. Other analyses includ- ed quantification of glycosaminoglycans and total DNA content. Two samples of synovial membrane were also collected per joint (each 3 mm2) and pro- cessed for histology and mRNA analysis. Successful collection of tissue was defined as having enough tissue or synovial fluid to perform all planned analy- ses. Surgical time was defined as the time from sy- novial fluid collection to closure of the instrument portal. Horses were evaluated for at least 2 weeks following completion of the study and were then re- turned to the seller. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using a repeated measure mixed model ANOVA. Statistical significance was defined as P<0.05. Results In the joints with synovitis, median (IQR) scores at baseline 0 (0-0) were significantly different from all other time points (T4: 2(2-3); T10: 3(3-3); T24: 3(3-4); all P < 0.001). Peak vertical reaction forces in synovitis joints were significantly lower (increased lameness) than control joints at T4 and T10 (P<0.0001) but were not differ- ent by T24. Stance duration was lower in synovitis joints at T10 (P<0.05) compared with controls. Iner- tial sensor variables at baseline were significantly different from T10 (PDmin and PDMax: P<0.001) but not at T24. Synovial fluid volumes averaged about 2 mLs at each time point, regardless of classification as con- trol or synovitis limb, and all joints provided enough fluid to perform all planned assessments. Of the 24 horses used, four joints from four differ- ent horses had a moderate amount of hemorrhagic fluid exit the instrument portal at the conclusion of surgery that was self-limiting. All horses tolerated the procedure well and no horses reacted during arthroscope insertion or tissue collection. Mean (+/- s.d.) surgical time was 13 +/- 7.6 min per joint (range: 3-35 min). Arthroscopy enabled access to the me- dial malleolus of the tibia as well as a substantial Figure 2.

All planned articular cartilage and synovial mem- brane samples were able to be collected from all horses and were sufficient to perform all planned assessments. No horses had postoperative compli- cations involving the surgical procedures. Conclusions The reported arthroscopic technique and synovitis model provided a platform for a non-terminal study and facilitated investigation of symptom and dis- ease modifying effects of a joint therapy. This meth- odology could be considered in testing emerging joint disease treatments.

This suggests allogeneic equine BMDMSCs may be a valuable stem cell source for the treatment of mus- culoskeletal disease in the horse. Introduction Although there are multiple sources of stem cells in the horse, BMDMSCs are commonly used for mus- culoskeletal injury2 and have been found to have increased chondrogenic abilities when compared to adipose-derived MSCs.3 However, expansion of MSCs has multiple clinical disadvantages. Currently, BMDMSCs require 2-4 weeks for culture expansion before treatment may be pursued. This process is expensive and time consuming. Additionally, there is some evidence that BMDMSCs from diseased or older donors may be of decreased quality.4,5 Allogeneic (non-self) BMDMSCs (\"self\") BMDMSCs by providing an \"off-the-shelf\" treatment, allowing for immediate treatment and careful selection of su- perior cells from young, healthy donors. However, the immune properties of allogeneic stem cells must be examined prior to the incorporation of these cells into clinical practice. Previous studies have found allogeneic BMDMSCs capable of immune suppression in vitro.6-8 In addi- tion, these cells have been used clinically with a low rate of joint flare and clinical success.9,10 However, we are unaware of any study that has directly com- pared the immune properties of allogeneic and au- tologous BMDMSCs in vitro. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the immunomodulatory properties of autologous and allogeneic equine BMDMSCs and to identify the mechanism for the im- munosuppressive properties of allogeneic BMDM- SCs. Methods We conducted studies to assess the immunological properties of equine allogeneic BMDMSCs com- pared with autologous BMDMSCs. For as- sessment of inherent immunogenicity, the relative ability of allogeneic and autologous BMDMSCs to stimulate spontaneous proliferation of equine lym- phocytes was compared. This was mononuclear cells (PB- MCs) with BMDMSCs suc- cinimidyl ester (CFSE) Fischer Scientific), analysis by flow cytometry. The immunosuppressive activity of autologous and allogeneic BMDMSCs was evaluated by au- tologous or allogeneic BMDMSCs to activated lym- phocytes and assessing of lymphocyte proliferation and IFN production using CFSE stain- combina- tions were In addition, assays were performed to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which equine mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) suppress lymphocyte function. Poten- tial mechanisms evaluated included production of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), nitric oxide, transforming growth factor-beta, and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygen- ase. Inhibitors for each of the pathways were added to co-cultures of stimulated PBMCs and BMDMSCs and lymphocyte proliferation was using CFSE by flow cytometry.Autologous and allogeneic equine mesenchymal stem cells exhibit equivalent immunomodulatory properties in vitro This is a summary of an article by Drs. Aimee Colbath, Steven Dow, Wayne McIlwraith and Laurie Goodrich and Ms. Nikki Phillips published in Stem Cells and Development.1 192 ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH CENTERRESEARCH | FOCUS 4 - Continued Development of Novel Therapies for Traumatic Synovitis, Capsulitis, and Osteoarthritis in the Horse Once the mechanism of immune suppression was identified as prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) mediated, PGE 2 levels were measured in the supernatants of untreated MSCs and PBMC cocultures as well as co- cultures treated with a PGE 2 inhibitor. Data was col- lected using a commercially available ELISA (PGE 2 Parameter Assay Kit, R&D systems\u00ae) per the Immunogenicity testing revealed and allogeneic BMDMSCs both induced mild but equiv- alent levels of spontaneous lymphocyte activation in vitro. Increased lymphocyte proliferation was only found at ratios of 1 autologous MSC per 10 PBMCs, or 1 allogeneic MSC per 10 or 50 PBMCs (P<0.05) (Figure 1). When immune suppressive ability was compared, a statistically significant and equivalent immune suppression was noted for autologous and alloge- neic BMDMSCs at 1 MSC per 10 PBMCs (Figure 2). Likewise, IFN expression by PBMCs decreased in a dose dependent manner with the addition of al- logeneic and autologous MSCs, (Figure that incubation of MSCs with acti- vated PBMCs in the presence of an inhibitor of the cyclooxygenase pathway, indomethacin, resulted in a significant reversal of the immune suppressive ef- fects of allogeneic MSCs (Figure 4). This indicates that allogeneic BMDMSCs use the cyclooxygenase pathway as a mechanism of immune suppression of lymphocyte proliferation. PGE 2 levels in super- natants from MSCs/PBMCs cocultures treated with indomethacin showed a significant decrease in PGE 2 (P<0.05) confirming indomethacin effectively blocked the PGE 2 pathway. Conclusions Autologous BMDMSCs are extensively used for the treatment of equine tendonitis, desmitis and osteo- arthritis in the horse. Although allogeneic BMDM- SCs could be a more convenient, cost-effective, and potentially increase the quality of cells by donor Figure 1. Lymphocyte proliferation assay: Relative nonimmunogenic at low ratios of MSCs:PBMCs. No difference was detected between the immunogenicity of autologous and allogeneic MSCs at any ratio. However, a small degree of immunogenicity was noted when autologous MSCs were added at a ratio of 1:10, and allogeneic MSCs were added at ratios of were immunosuppressive, shown by a decrease in lymphocyte proliferation at a ratio of 1 MSC per 10 PBMCs.

To determine whether allogeneic or autologous BMDMSCs elicited an immune response cells were co-cultured and lymphocyte prolif- eration assessed. We found a small, but equivalent amount of lymphocyte proliferation at high ratios of MSCs to PBMCs. In contrast, when MSCs were co-cultured with stimulated PBMSCs, MSCs were noted to be immunosuppressive causing a de- crease in lymphocyte proliferation. Previous in vitro studies using human and equine BMDMSCs support our findings demonstrating an increase in the im- munosuppressive properties of MSCs preactivated with IFN and a decrease in production of inflamma- tory cytokines when MSC media was used to treat stimulated PBMCs.11,12 Our study demonstrated the source of the MSCS (al- logeneic or autologous) is not an important variable in determining the degree of immune suppression in vitro. This finding could have significant clinical implications, as allogeneic BMDMSCs may be a more convenient and less expensive product for the treatment of musculoskeletal disease in the horse. This study suggests that further in vivo studies are warranted to compare the behavior of allogeneic and autologous cells within the normal and inflamed joint. The pathway of MSC immunosuppression has been investigated in the human, murine, and canine.13-15 Our study found that only PGE 2 was an important mediator of immunosuppression by allogeneic BMDMSCs. This finding is in agreement with a previ- ous study that investigated the role of interleukin-6, nitric oxide, and PGE 2 as mediators of immunosup- pression by allogeneic BMDMSCs.6 Based on our findings, we suggest that further re- search should be conducted in vivo to compare the relative clinical benefits of the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating properties of allogeneic and au- tologous BMDMSCs. In conclusion, and autologous BMDMSCs appear to be equally immu- nosuppressive in vitro. It also appears that equine MSCs principally use the cyclooxygenase pathway for suppression of T cell function.Figure 3. Immunosuppression assay (IFN expression).

However, for bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), rat MSCs have been reported to experience a rapid decline in chondrogenic poten- tial with aging that is inconsistent with MSCs from humans and other species. This study refutes those data by identifying culture conditions in which mid- dle-aged rat MSCs undergo robust chondrogenesis. Introduction The ability of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to heal articular cartilage defects in the aging popu- lation has been questioned by evidence that the chondrogenic potential of MSCs can decrease with age.1 This question can be addressed in vivo using rats, which are commonly used for early pre- clinical testing of cartilage tissue engineering ther- apies, and have a relatively short lifespan. Howev- er, age-related declines in chondrogenic potential have been reported to be particular strong for rat MSCs as conventional chondrogenic conditions of pellet cultures in defined medium has failed to sup- port chondrogenesis from animals beyond young adulthood.2,3 Using MSCs from middle-aged rats, the objective of this study was to reconsider limitations associated with aging of rat MSCs, in culture con- ditions involving a scaffold, and in both serum-free and -supplemented chondrogenic medium. Methods MSC isolation and culture Bone marrow was flushed from the femurs of 14-15 month old Wistar rats, and the nucleated cells were seeded at a concentration of 0.75 x106 cells/cm2 in alphaMEM 10% (expansion medium), and then tryp- sinized after 2 days. The collected cells were further expanded by seeded at 6 x103 cells/cm2 on tissue culture plastic (TCP) or fibrinogen-coated TCP.4 The effect of two days of exposure to chondrogenic me- dium (described below) was compared to continu- ous culture in expansion medium. Chondrogenic culture and analysis MSCs were encapsulated in 1.5% the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml TGF, or with TGF plus 5% FBS. After 15 days of culture, samples were evaluated for GAG (DMMB) and hydroxyproline (DMBA) accumulation. Histolog- ical sections were stained for GAG (toluidine blue) or type II collagen. Results Monolayer expansion Colony-forming culture resulted in approximate 1-4 million MSCs per animals. After 7 days of monolay- er expansion on TCP or fibrinogen, the total num- ber of population doublings on fibrinogen surfaces (2.5) was modestly higher than TCP (1.9); therefore, all subsequent expansion was conducted on fibrin- ogen surfaces. MSCs that were cultured in chon- drogenic medium for two days, and then switch to expansion medium resulted in nearly twice as many population doublings as expansion medium only. Chondrogenesis MSCs were expanded through one passage prior to seeding into agarose and culturing in chondro- genic media. In serum-free chondrogenic medium, GAG and hydroxyproline accumulation were not Culture conditions that support expansion and chondrogenesis of middle-aged rat mesenchymal stem cells This is a summary of an article by Dr. John Kisiday, Mr. John Schwartz, and Drs.

Next, using MSCs from 4 animals, chondro- genesis in serum-free chondrogenic medium was compared to negative controls that did not contain TGF, and chondrogenic medium supplemented with 5% FBS. After 15 days of culture, GAG accumu- lation in negative controls was below the detection limit of the DMMB assay, while hydroxyproline ac- cumulation was extremely wet weight). Hydroxyproline accumulation in serum-free chondrogenic medium was more than 20-fold higher than negative control cultures. With serum-supple- mentation, GAG and hydroxyproline accumulation increased 2.7- and 3.4-fold over serum-free cultures (P<0.002). Histological analysis indicated that not all encapsulated MSCs accumulated a GAG- and type I collagen-rich pericellular matrix. The increase in ma- trix accumulation with serum-supplementation coin- cided with a higher frequency of cells surrounded by pericellular matrix. Conclusions The use of rats to study age-related changes in chondrogenic potential is not supported by the cur- rent literature that has shown a severe decrease in chondrogenesis beyond young adulthood. This assumption is challenged by the current study in which evidence of chondrogenesis of middle-aged rat MSCs in agarose cultures was reliably detected from male or female donors. For many years, se- rum-free medium has been widely used to induce MSC chondrogenesis in vitro.4 Here, the addition of serum to serum-free culture increased the fre- quency of robust differentiation and overall matrix accumulation. With serum-supplementation the ac- cumulation of GAG ( ~2 g/mg ww) was approximate- ly similar to young adult equine MSCs that were cultured in the same manner, while hydroxyproline accumulation in rat cultures ( ~0.18 g/mg ww) was approximately 50% of equine cultures.5 These data suggest that the propensity of aging rat MSCs to undergo chondrogenesis is approximately similar to other species.

Therefore, for therapies in which MSCs are expected to repair articular cartilage the cells must receive specific cues that induce differenti- ation to a chondrocyte-like phenotype. This study investigated the potential to rapidly generate chon- drocyte-like equine MSCs in vitro. to a chondro- cyte-like phenotype within days. However, after re- moval from chondrogenic medium the cells strongly expressed a marker of hypertrophy, which is sug- gestive of endochondral ossification. These data indicated that minimal induction of chondrogenesis is not sufficient for cartilage repair, and support the concept that chondrocyte-like MSCs are better suit- ed for bone repair. Introduction Undifferentiated MSCs that have not received chondrogenic cues prior to implantation have not proven capable of healing cartilage defects. It has been postulated that the induction of MSC chondro- genesis prior to implantation, hereafter referred to as 'chondrogenic preconditioning', is necessary to result in a stable, chondrocyte-like phenotype that secretes and maintains cartilage-like repair tissue in vivo.1 Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate protocols for inducing equine MSC chon- drogenesis in vitro using a new approach that results in suspensions of cells that are suited for injectable therapies. Undifferentiated MSCs dexamethasone and transforming growth factor beta (TGF).2 Following preconditioning culture, commitment to chondro- genesis was evaluated by isolating the MSCs from the peptide hydrogel, seeding into agarose hydro- absence of TGF. Methods Equine MSCs were isolated from bone marrow as- pirates taken from 5 young adult horses and cul- ture-expanded through ~8 population doublings in expansion encapsulated in the self-assembling peptide previous techniques3 no more than 5 days of culture, MSCs were re- leased from the peptide by disrupted the hydrogel with micropipetting. The cell/peptide suspension was treated with 0.25% trypsin/EDTA for 5 minutes, and then expansion medium plus 0.1% collagenase for 45 minutes. The cell-peptide suspension was incubated for 30 minutes in tissue culture flasks to allow the released cells to adhere, and the adherent cell population was collected as an individual cell suspension and seeded into 1.5% agarose at 10x106 cells/ml. MSCs from in chondrogenic medium without TGF. Agarose control cultures were created in a similar manner using undifferentiated MSC at the start of priming cultures and maintained in TGF-free or 10 ng/ml TGF medium. All cultures were evaluated for GAG and hydroxyproline accumulation, type II col- lagen immunohistochemistry, and gene expression of types I, II, and X collagen 17 days after the start of preconditioning culture.

One day of chondrogenic preconditioning did not significantly stimulate GAG accumulation over negative controls. Two days of chondrogenic preconditioning resulted in GAG accumulation that was not significantly different from positive controls, while three day of preconditioning resulted in GAG accumulation that was ~80% greater than positive controls. Hydroxyproline accumulation was largely similar to GAG accumulation. Four and five days of preconditioning did not improve matrix accumula- tion. Type II collagen staining was reflective of ma- trix accumulation. Therefore, the remainder of the study focused on three days of chondrogenic pre- conditioning. For MSCs that were preconditioned for 3 days and cultured in negative control medi- um for 14 days, types I and II collagen expression were comparable to positive controls, while type X collagen expression was ~65-fold higher than posi- tive controls. Potential induction of immunogenicity with preconditioning culture was indicated by MHCII expression, which was nearly absence in undiffer- entiated MSCs, and ~7% positive immediately after preconditioning culture. Conclusions This study demonstrated the potential for effective and efficient chondrogenic preconditioning, which is consistent with reports that temporary exposure to TGF is sufficient to induce MSC chondrogenesis or sustain ECM accumulation.1-7 Bone marrow MSCs have been reported to exhibit indicators of hyper- trophy with the progression of chondrogenesis in vitro,8,9 or with subcutaneous implantation,10 which lends caution that chondrogenic preconditioning may direct MSCs to endochondral ossification. This potential was evidence in the current study given the high level of type X collagen expression by pre- conditioned MSCs. In addition, while undifferentiat- ed MSCs are considered duration on chondrogenic preconditioning of equine bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in self-assembling peptide hydrogel.

The newly designed aftermarket suspension system reduces some as- pects of shock and vibration exposure, potentially improving the quality of life for those needing to use manual tilt-in-space wheelchairs. Introduction Tilt-in-space wheelchairs are designed to address the adverse effects associated with pressure man- agement, spasticity, respiratory and digestive com- plications, sitting tolerance, pain, edema, postural realignment, pressure sores, and hypotension that accompany prolonged sitting.1 The tilt-in-space de- sign allows the seat of the wheelchair to be rotated independent of the frame. In order to do so, tilt-in- space wheelchairs tend to be heavier than tradition- al manual wheelchairs. To reduce their weight, sus- pension is not incorporated into manual tilt-in-space wheelchairs. QuadshoX LLC (Fort Collins, CO) has created a patented method to attach a spring-damp- er unit to the rear wheel (Figure 1) with hopes of re- ducing secondary injuries to wheelchair users asso- ciated with shock and vibration exposure. The aim of this study was to investigate the shock and vibra- tion reducing capabilities of the newly available af- termarket rear wheel suspension system for manual tilt-in-space wheelchairs. Methods Ten healthy non-wheelchair users volunteered for the study. Subjects were pushed by the same trained investigator over four different obstacles while using a Quickie IRIS\u00ae Tilt-in-Space manual wheelchair (Sunrise Medical, Phoenix, AZ). The sub- jects traversed the obstacles with the wheelchair as manufactured and with the QuadshoX suspension kit. Surfaces included a/an 1) exterior door thresh- old, 2) truncated domes, 3) 2 cm descent, and 4) 2 cm ascent. Two solid wheels of different diameters, Primo Cheng Shin Tires (Cheng Shin Rubber, Yuan- lin, Taiwan), were also studied: a 0.381-meter (small) diameter wheel and a 0.508-meter (large) diameter wheel. Rigid chair trials were completed first, with suspension trials ~2 weeks later. Three acceptable trials were collected in each condition. Suspension chair trials needed to be within 0.2 sec (on average) of the matched rigid chair trials as determined by hand timing. A tri-axial accelerometer was mounted to the rear of the wheelchair seat pan with signals sampled at 2000 Hz. Peak resultant accelerations were analyzed from surface 1, 3-4, root mean square (RMS) resultant accelerations were analyzed from Effect of rear wheel suspension on tilt-in-space wheelchair shock and vibration attenuation. This is a summary of a paper published by Ms. Molly Hischke and Dr. Raoul Reiser in Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (PM&R).\u00b9 Figure 1.

The ISO 2631-1 establishes methods to investigate shock and vibration exposure.2 The standards state frequency weightings are applied to frequencies to most harm- ful for human exposure (4-12 Hz for seated subjects). Therefore, frequency weighted (FW) and un-weight- ed peaks were analyzed. Results The use of suspension decreased the un-weighted peak acceleration at the rear wheel when it impact- ed the door threshold, when it traversed the 2 cm ascent, and when the rear wheel was ascended 2 cm (p<0.05). The use of suspension decreased FW peak accelerations at the rear wheel when it impact- ed and left the door threshold by 10-25%, and when the rear wheel descended 2 cm by 19-34% (p<0.05). The use of suspension did not significantly change the un-weighted accelerations when the rear wheel left the door threshold, and when the rear wheel traversed the 2 cm decent. There were no signif- icant differences in FW peak accelerations at the rear wheel during the 2 cm ascent with the use of suspension. There were no significant differences in weighted and un-weighted peak accelerations at the front caster wheel over any of the four obsta- cles. With suspension, RMS and total VDV significantly decreased 14% and 10-22% respectively (p<0.05). There were no significant differences between the rigid and suspended chair in total vibration power in frequency octaves most harmful in human exposure (4-12 Hz). The results of wheel diameter impacting peak accelerations, RMS, VDV and total power were inconclusive because there were significant differ- ences in time spent over the obstacles.Conclusions The results indicate the aftermarket rear wheel suspension reduces some aspects of shock and vibration exposure, specifically at the rear wheel. Numerous health risks are correlated with shock and vibration exposure such as low back pain, neck pain, discomfort, and muscle fatigue. To our knowl- edge, there is no set amount of reduction in shock and vibration exposure decreasing the health risks with exposure. As of now, the recommendation is to reduce shock and vibration exposure as much as possible. The reductions in shock and vibration with the use of the aftermarket rear wheel suspension may decrease the health risks, such as pain and muscle fatigue. The results may be utilized by clini- cians and wheelchair users for proper selection as well as aid in the future development of wheelchair suspension. References 1.

These models are essential for investigating the efficacy of MSCs and have yielded promising results. Summary The horse as a model for orthopedic disease in humans Although small animal laboratory models have been used extensively for testing MSCs in musculoskel- etal disease,2-4 these models equine models. Horses' carti- lage thickness, joint size and joint forces are more appropriate for translational models.5 Further, the equine superficial digital flexor tendon is particular- ly appropriate as a translational model of tendon- itis with similarities to the human Achilles tendon.6,7 Equine experimental studies may include controlled exercise using a treadmill, and ample synovial flu- id or tendon tissue is available for biochemical and biomechanical testing.8-11 In addition, horses are used for athletic endeavors and suffer from naturally occurring disease including osteoarthritis, desmitis, tendonitis, meniscal injury and osteochondritis des- sicans.12-15 The ability to assess naturally occurring disease and the availability of technical equipment including arthroscopy, CT and MRI make this popu- lation particularly relevant for pre-clinical testing. In addition, pain and lameness may be assessed both subjectively and objectively using force plates and/ or inertial sensor systems.16 Histological analysis can be performed both for models of tendonitis and osteoarthritis. Specific experimental models of post-traumatic os- teoarthritis include a well-established radial carpal osteochondral fragment model. In addition, two im- pact models of osteoarthritis have been described. These include an impact to the medial femoral con- dyle or palmar aspect of the metacarpus.17,18 Mod- els of superficial digital flexor tendon injury include surgical removal of a window of or column of MSCs for treatment of musculoskeletal disease have expanded rapid- ly in the last several years. The above-mentioned equine models of musculoskeletal injury play an important role in addressing some of the questions regarding MSC mechanisms and efficacy. In partic- ular, equine models may be useful in determining optimal cell delivery source, cell dose and the best way to pre-condition MSCs prior to intra-articular or intra-tendinous injection.

Although the in vivo behavior of irradiated MSCs is yet to be studied, photobiomod- ulation to increase cellular expression of cytokines that regulate inflammation and promote angiogene- sis may become a clinically useful technique. Ther- apeutic interventions utilizing energy from mono- chromatic light are extremely dose-dependent, thus translation of in vitro laser protocols from the labo- ratory to the clinical setting will require quantifica- tion of the energy dose reaching target tissues in the in vivo environment. Further investigation of the potential for beneficial effects on MSCs from 1064 nm laser photobiomodulation to enhance their ther- apeutic properties is warranted. Introduction This study examined the influence of neodymi- um-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser mesen- chymal stem cell (MSC) viability, proliferation, and cytokine expression in vitro. Photobiomodulation of cells using monochromatic light is a technique designed to influence cellular processes. Previ- ous studies have shown dose-dependent effects of low-level laser irradiation on cell proliferation and cytokine expression in a range of cell types and species. Evidence for the influence of 1064 nm wavelength near-infrared irradiation on MSCs is sparse, and high-energy doses have shown inhibi- tory effects. Methods MSC cultures from six horses were exposed to 1064nm irradiation with an energy density of 9.77 J/cm2 and a mean output power of 13.0 W for 10 sec. MSC viability and proliferation were evaluated through flow cytometry and real-time live cell anal- ysis. Gene expression and cytokine production in the first 24 h after irradiation were analyzed through polymerase chain reaction (PCR), multiplex assay, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results Twenty-four hours after irradiation, irradiated MSCs demonstrated a significant increase in expression of interleukin (IL)-10 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) compared with control MSCs. No dif- ference in viability was detected between irradiat- ed and control MSCs. Irradiated cells demonstrated slightly lower proliferation rates, but remained with- in 3.5% confluence of control cells. Conclusions Under the specified irradiation parameters used in this study, equine MSCs remained viable and expressed increased concentrations of IL-10 and VEGF. IL-10 has an anti-inflammatory action by in- hibiting the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines at the transcriptional level. This response to 1064 nm irradiation shows promise in the photobiomod- ulation of MSCs to enhance their therapeutic prop- erties. References 1. Peat FJ, Colbath AC, Bentsen LM, Goodrich LR, King MR.

Oxidative stress was evident when MSC chondrogenesis was induced in conventional serum-free medium. Add- ing serum to the differentiation medium greatly decreased oxidative stress, and coincided with an increase in collagen synthesis. Therefore, reducing oxidative stress is an effective means to promote neo-cartilage synthesis by chondrogenic MSCs. Introduction The ability of bone marrow MSCs to undergo chon- drogenesis has fostered enthusiasm for tissue engineering approaches to resurface damaged or diseased articular cartilage. Current strategies for inducing MSCs chondrogenesis are largely fo- cused on growth factors that stimulate differentia- tion, although it has been postulated that additional measures to support the growth and maintenance of neo-cartilage will increase the likelihood of suc- cess.1 Oxidative stress, as indicated by intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species ROS, has been shown to reduce matrix synthesis in chondrocyte cultures.2-3 Therefore, the objectives of this study were to characterized levels of intracellular ROS during chondrogenesis in serum-free culture, and determine whether lowering levels of ROS coincid- ed with improved matrix synthesis. Methods Equine MSCs were isolated from bone marrow TGF-1) for up to 15 days. To study the effect of serum on ROS production and chondrogene- sis, 5% FBS was added to chondrogenic medium. Analysis - In agarose cultures, CellROX\u00ae reagent were used to evaluate intracelluar ROS, qualitative- ly using a fluorescent microscope. Extracellular ma- trix accumulation by quantifying the (GAG) hydroxy- proline, by DMMB and DMBA dye binding assay, respectively. Cell viability was evaluated using the CellTiter Blue (CTB) assay. GAG, hydroxyproline and cell viability data were normalized by wet weight. Gene expression of type I and II collagens was eval- GSH/GSSG-GloTM assay. Results In serum-free medium, staining for ROS increased with time in culture, appearing to reach a maximum on day 6 that was sustained through 12 days of culture. Compared to ITS, the addition of 5% FBS greatly decreased the intensity of ROS staining at all timepoints. Glutathione decreased ~12-fold be- tween days 1 and 6 of chondrogenic culture, and was not affected by the presence of FBS. After 15 days of culture, FBS supplementation increased hy- droxyproline accumulation ~80%; otherwise, mea- sures of matrix accumulation, cell viability, and colla- gen gene expression were largely unaffected. Conclusions In cell culture, it is known that serum starvation can increase the production of ROS,4-6 which was con- sistent with elevated levels of ROS in chondrogenic MSCs with time in serum-free culture.

The most significant effect of FBS was a ~80% increase in collagen accumulation with- out a concomitant increase in proteoglycan content, which is consistent with reports that ROS can dif- ferentially affect the synthesis of collagen and pro- teoglycans.8 In conclusion, this study identified tem- poral changes in the oxidative environment during MSCs chondrogenesis, and the potential benefit of adding antioxidants to existing methods of inducing differentiation. Further, the evaluation of serum as an antioxidant here may be particularly important for tissue engineering strategies that seek to induce chondrogenesis in vivo as serum is a component of synovial fluid.

Introduction Regenerative medicine encompasses the use of stem cell and other cell-based therapies, growth factors, and biologics in the management of each individual's innate capabilities for tissue repair and regeneration to optimize a therapeutic outcome. These therapies are increasingly being used in sports injuries, for the most part without clearly de- fined evidence base. The goal of this meeting is to educate practitioners and the public, and to pioneer a means of accumulating data on the safe and effec- tive way to use regenerative medicine therapies in pediatric and adolescent. Conclusion In this meeting, seven actions were endorsed by the group. Action one advises caution when treat- ing youth as the research continues. While platelet rich plasma (PRP) use for musculoskeletal injuries has been deemed relatively safe in adults, poten- tial long-term effects on youth have not yet been thoroughly researched. The second action recom- mends improvements in regulatory oversight. While these therapies are relatively safe, they are often provided without regulatory oversight. There are many clinics offering unregulated cell-based ther- apies, especially with sports related injuries. Many of these clinics are registering clinical trials on Clin- icalTrials.gov to increase their credibility. There is an urgent need for this lack of regulation to be ad- dressed and resolved. Action three calls to expand governmental and other research funding as this would help create the evidence base to guide the already widespread use of the cell-based therapies in young adults. Action four calls for creation of a system of registries. These registries will help es- tablish use and outcome data which would provide key information to fill knowledge gaps in the field. Action five calls for development of a multi-year pol- icy and agenda and to build support for it. This will be important going forward, as it will help keep the industry regulated and strictly enforced. Action six encourages the building of a multidisciplinary con- sortium. This will help advance the evidence base and promote regulation in a systematic way. Finally, action seven calls for development and pursuit of a clear collective impact agenda. Regenerative medicine therapies offer a very potent way to assist with the treatment of sports injuries, but the data on their effectiveness and long-term safety is limited, especially in young adults.

However, in this study in a rabbit model, the use of PRP did not en- hance healing. Introduction This article addressed the use of platelet-rich plas- ma (PRP) in the effectiveness of healing ligament injuries, specifically in the medial collateral ligament (MCL). New Zealand White rabbits were used as a model as the healing of their MCL closely reflects that of a human. MCL injuries are the most common knee ligament injuries and can usually heal with non- operative treatment. Often however, the mechanical and histological properties have been reported to not return to normal. For this reason, PRP has been advocated to advance the healing of the MCL. This is because PRP contains inherently high concen- trations of beneficial growth factors that have been demonstrated to improve tissue healing, especially during the inflammatory phase of healing. While the use of PRP injection for injured ligaments is used worldwide, there are many conflicting reports in the literature and debate continues surrounding the ef- fectiveness and role of PRP in accelerating ligament healing. Potential factors that may affect the effec- tiveness of PRP include platelet concentration, leu- kocyte count, timing of the treatment, and activation of platelets within PRP. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a single dose of PRP at different platelet concen- trations could accelerate healing and correspond- ingly improve histological characteristics and bio- mechanical properties when injected immediately postoperatively in the injured MCL model. The cen-tral hypothesis was that PRP would accelerate heal- ing in an MCL injury model after acute trauma and correspondingly enhance the histological and bio- mechanical properties when compared with plate- let-poor plasma (PPP) or saline. Methods Eighty skeletally mature New Zealand White rabbits were used. The MCL was torn midbody to stimulate a grade 3 tear. After an acute injury of the MCL, the administration of autologous PRP at three different platelet concentrations (0 million/uL, PPP; 0.6 mil- lion/uL, 2 x PRP, and 1.2 million/uL 4 x PRP) were per- formed and compared with a saline injection control in the contralateral knee. Histological analysis and a biomechanical endpoint characterization were uti- lized to assess ligamentous healing and compared it to a sham surgery group. Results The most important finding of this study was that one single dose of either PPP or 2x PRP at the time of the injury did not accelerate ligament healing. Additionally, 4x PRP demonstrated a significant neg- ative effect on ligament strength as well as colla- gen orientation at 6 weeks after an injury. Thus, the hypothesis was not supported. This raises concern that the current practice of treating knee ligament injuries, specifically MCL tears, with PRP immediate- ly after an injury or surgery may not improve healing at low doses of PRP but could be harming ligament healing at higher PRP doses. Conclusion One single dose of PPP and 2\u00d7 PRP at the time of in- jury did not improve ligament healing. In addition, 4\u00d7 PRP negatively affected ligament strength and his- tological characteristics at 6 weeks after an injury.Use of platelet-rich plasma immediately after an injury did not improve ligament healing, and increasing platelet concentrations was detrimental in an in vivo animal model This is a summary of an article by Drs. R.F. LaPrade, and J.

However, as is clear from the findings in this study, further studies to deter- mine the timing and dosing frequency of PRP to treat ligament healing are required. References 1.

Introduction The inherent reduction in mechanical loading asso- ciated with microgravity has been shown to result in dramatic decreases in the bone mineral density (BMD) and mechanical strength of skeletal tissue.1-3 In addition to this elevation in fracture risk, previous work has demonstrated that skeletal fracture heal- ing is severely inhibited by the microgravity envi- ronment experienced during spaceflight.3;4-7 low-intensity pulsed ultra- sound (LIPUS) have been used to treat nonunion and delayed healing of bony fractures in humans by generating low-level mechanical stresses at the fracture site and inducing subsequent cellular and molecular responses involved in the healing cas- cade.8-12 Due to their noninvasive nature, compact equipment size, ease of administration, low compli- cation rate, and high efficacy, SWT and LIPUS have become well-accepted and commonly used clinical therapeutic techniques and make them ideal candi- dates to increase the rate of bony fracture healing during scenarios such as spaceflight.12 The objec- tive of this study was to interrogate the efficacy of these two therapies as countermeasures to the in- hibited fracture healing experienced during partial gravity unloading in a previously developed large animal (sheep) model with the hypothesis that bone formation and strength would be increased follow- ing treatment.1Methods A total of twenty-eight skeletally mature, female, Rambouillet Columbian ewes (age > 6 years) were included in this study. Animal use approval was granted by the Colorado State University Animal Care and Use Committee (Approval #11-2938A). Nine animals were randomly allocated to an Earth- based mechanically unloaded (0.25G) group and underwent hindlimb metatarsal unloading as de- scribed by Gadomski et al.1 trans-biarticu- lar external skeletal fixation device (IMEX, Longview, TX) was implanted on the right hindlimb such that the metatarsal bone was isolated from mechanical loading. These animals were then exposed to me- chanical unloading of the metatarsal bone for a pe- riod of 3 weeks (21 days), at which point a 3.0mm ostectomy was created and stabilized with a fixa- tion plate. An additional full gravity group of 9 an- imals (1G Group) was included in which an identical 3.0mm diaphyseal ostectomy was created, plated, and casted, allowing full loading to be transmitted through the metatarsal bone. SWT was administered to five animals from each of the two groups (0.25G-SWT and 1G-SWT) 6 days fol- lowing the creation of the ostectomy with an applied energy of 0.63 mJ/mm2, a frequency of 5Hz, and a total shock count of 4,000 (Storz Medical AG, T\u00e4ger- wilen, Switzerland) (Figure 1). LIPUS was adminis- tered to four animals from each group (0.25G-LIPUS and 1G-LIPUS) two days following surgery for 20 minutes per day, five days per week for the remain- der of the four-week healing period by applying a 200-\u00b5sec burst of 3.3MHz sine waves repeated at 1 kHz with an average intensity of 20 mW/cm2.

Results Results of the 4-point bending tests demonstrated no statistically significant differences in stiffness within the 0.25G groups or 1G groups. Significant alterations in bone volume fraction and bone min- eral density (BMD) within the fracture gap were not observed following SWT or LIPUS treatment as compared to control specimens for the 0.25G or 1G gravitational groups. Callus BMD of 0.25G-SWT specimens was significantly greater (p<0.05) than that of 1G-SWT specimens. Callus bone volume (BV) was not significantly elevated in 0.25G-SWT or 0.25G-LIPUS groups as compared to 0.25G-C spec- imens; however, callus BV was significantly reduced in specimens as compared to 1G-C and 1G-SWT specimens (p<0.05). Figure 1. (A) SWT was administered around the circumference of the fracture site of the 0.25G-SWT and 1G-SWT groups 6 days following the creation of the ostectomy. (B) The LIPUS ultrasound probe was secured to the external fixation frame via a polyethylene fixture to ensure identical placement against the skin overlaying the metatarsal diaphysis between treatment sessions for 0.25G-LIPUS animals.

Osteoblast numbers (Figure 2) were increased 87% and 120% in 0.25G-SWT and 0.25G-LIPUS specimens as compared to 0.25G-C specimens on the periosteal surface, respectively, and 152% and 244% on the re- numbers were sig- nificantly elevated in 1G-LIPUS specimens as com- pared to 1G-SWT and 1G-C groups, with increases of 18% and 23% in 1G-SWT and 1G-LIPUS specimens as compared to 1G-C specimens, respectively (p<0.05). Periosteal osteoclast numbers were significantly re- by 82% and 86%, respectively, in 0.25G-SWT and 0.25G-LIPUS specimens as compared to 0.25G- C specimens (p<0.05). Mineralizing surface was sig- nificantly 53% and 92%, respectively, in 0.25G-SWT and 0.25G-LIPUS specimens as com- pared to 0.25G-C specimens, while bone forma- tion rate was significantly elevated 88% and 80%, respectively, as compared to 0.25G-C specimens (p<0.05).Conclusions These data provide strong evidence that SWT and LIPUS elevate osteoblast numbers and bone formation rates as well as decrease osteoclast numbers in a large animal model of partial gravity unloading; however, our hypothesis was only par- tially confirmed. While bone formation rates were in- creased following LIPUS and SWT treatment under partial-unloading, no increase in 4-week mechani- cal strength was observed. It is possible that an increase in fracture healing (i.e. callus mechanical competence) would be experienced at longer time- points under reduced loading conditions given the increase in osteoblast numbers and bone formation parameters following both treatments.

Introduction Joint disease has been defined as a complex im- balance in the homeostatic mechanisms of degra- dation and repair, with the inflammatory cascade playing a crucial role in the progressive catabolic process.1 Numerous intra-articular treatments have been used to affect pathological manifestations of joint disease in horses by decreasing the degree of inflammation within the affected articulation.2-4 How- ever, little attention has been focused on the vari- ous forms of physical rehabilitation that could aid in modifying joint disease and it's progression in hors- es.5 Rehabilitative approaches have become effec- tive treatment options for reducing or limiting harm- ful compensatory gait abnormalities in humans.6,7 Rehabilitation programs that address osteoarthritis and musculoskeletal injuries in humans often incor- porate some form of aquatic exercise. The purpose of the study reported here was to quantify clinical, biomechanical, and articular effects of exercise in an UWT, compared with results for simulated hand walking, in horses with unilateral experimentally in- duced carpal joint osteoarthritis. We hypothesized that aquatic therapy for horses with carpal joint os- teoarthritis would enhance neuromuscular function, reduce thoracic limb gait abnormalities associated with carpal joint pain and inflammation, and improve histologic characteristics of affected carpal joints, which would provide further objective support for the use of aquatic rehabilitation.Conclusion Exercise in an UWT significantly reduced synovial membrane inflammation and resulted in significant clinical improvements with regard to symmetric tho- racic limb loading, uniform activation patterns of select thoracic limb muscles, and return to baseline values for carpal joint flexion, compared with results for horses with simulated hand walking.

Soft tissue or joint mobilization is indicated to help limit the effects of joint immobilization and to restore proprioceptive mechanisms. Equine chiro- practic research has shown positive effects for pain relief, improving flexibility, reducing muscle hyperto- nicity, and restoring spinal motion symmetry Introduction Manual therapies involve the application of the hands to the body, with a diagnostic or therapeu- tic intent. In horses, a diverse array of manual tech- niques such as touch therapies, massage, joint mo- bilization, and manipulation (i.e., chiropractic) have been applied with a primary therapeutic intent (e.g., reduce pain or stiffness).1-3 However, all of these therapies also have important diagnostic value in assessing musculoskeletal pain and dysfunction that is not possible with other more traditional phys- ical examination approaches or imaging modalities. In sport horse practice, the primary issues that limit performance are chronic repetitive use injuries as- sociated with long active athletic careers of pushing physical and psychological limits of both horse and rider. Chronic, poorly-localized pain and stiffness combined with slower reflexes or altered muscle timing contribute to poor performance issues and increase the risk of acute injury and inflammation. Manual therapies can provide detailed soft tissue, osseous and articular evaluation techniques and unique methods to assess neuromuscular coordina- tion and strength in sport horses that are not possi- ble with routine lameness evaluation or neurologic tests.Identification of Rehabilitation Issues Any medical, surgical or rehabilitation plan is only as good as the diagnosis that it is based upon. As vet- erinarians, we are typically very good at establishing or defining diagnoses based on a known pathology or on anatomic localization (i.e., pathoanatomic di- agnosis). At times, we may even slide into the mis- guided approach of \"treating the diagnostic image\" without giving full consideration to determining the clinical relevance of the diagnostic imaging find- ings relative to the presenting or continued clinical signs of the patient. At the other end of the diagnos- tic-treatment spectrum are those owners and prac- titioners that are solely focused on the function of the horse (i.e., is the horse able to do its job) despite the accumulation of known musculoskeletal injuries and chronic, multi-limb lameness over a long active athletic career. Striving to find a balance between applying both structural and functional approaches is ideal for managing the athletic demands and inju- ries in sport horses. From the functional perspective, general rehabilita- tion issues to be addressed in equine athletes in- clude, in progressing order: 1) Pain management 2) Proprioceptive deficits 3) Stiffness 4) Weakness or fatigue 5) Neuromuscular control Pain management is always the first step in rehabili- tation as it is not possible or ethical to ask a patient to exercise or do stretching when they are in pain.

Nociceptive input by itself induces many other neurologic reflexes (e.g., withdrawal reflex, crossed-extensor reflex, etc.) that function acutely to protect the body from further injury. How- ever, chronic nociceptive input leads to peripher- al and central sensitization (i.e., wind-up) that has widespread neurologic and musculoskeletal effects that make clear distinctions between pain or lame- ness, altered proprioception or body awareness (i.e., somatoesthesia), and altered gait patterns dif- ficult to interpret. As horses move into the proprioceptive and flexibil- ity phases of rehabilitation, more focus is placed on how the horse is perceiving its environment through its sensory system and able to navigate through that environment with its motor system. This integration is often referred to as neuromuscular or neuromo- tor control and relies heavily on afferent signaling from proprioceptors, which include muscle spindle fibers in muscles, Golgi tendon organs, and many other soft tissue mechanoreceptors located in joint capsules and fascial planes. The motor component includes active and passive structures. The active structures that can be addressed with rehabilitation include all motor pathways from the motor cortex in the cerebrum for control of movement, the cer- ebellum for balance and coordination, down to the timing and strength of muscle contractions. Passive structures include the joint capsules, ligaments, and the superficial and deep fascial layers that cover and envelop muscles and neurovascular bundles. All of the sensory and motor components and active and passive structures must function optimally for the horse to be able to progress in a defined reha- bilitation or training program to build endurance and strength required for sport-specific demands. Pain Management The goal of most rehabilitation programs is the early initiation of movement to begin the process of re- storing normal joint motion, strength and coordina- tion. Acute pain and inflammation are typically man- aged with NSAIDs, cold therapies (i.e., ice), restricted exercise and compression wraps, if indicated, in an effort to protect local tissues and to limit excessive joint movement. Once the initial acute inflammato- ry phased has begun to subside in 3-5 days, then gentle, slow passive soft tissue or joint mobilization is indicated to help limit the effects of joint immobili- zation and to restore proprioceptive mechanisms.4,5 Joint mobilization is usually applied in a graded manner, with each grade increasing the range of joint movement. Grades 1 to 2 joint mobilization in- volve inducing small degrees of joint motion around the neutral joint axis (i.e., resting joint position) and then beginning to move the joint up to 50% of nor- mal joint range of motion for a specified articulation. If passive joint motion is too painful, then applying light pressure and inducing motion of the overlying skin and subcutaneous tissues may help to improve lymphatic flow and increase mechanoreceptor stim- ulation in an effort to inhibit nociceptive signaling via local and spinal cord mechanisms.6 Manual lymph drainage has been described for use in the man- agement of lymphedema in horses; however, no controlled studies exist evaluating its effectiveness.7 The reparative process of tissue healing includes collagen synthesis and fibrous tissue proliferation. Significant fascial restrictions or adhesions can limit injury recovery if proper mechanical stimulation and restoration of fascial glide of both superficial and deep tissues is not achieved. Skin rolling techniques and deep tissue massage provide increased level of mechanical stimulation of connective tissues, which may be required in patients with extensive fibrosis or soft tissue adhesions.2 Prolonged joint immobili- zation or forced stall rest are often counterproduc- tive to maintaining musculoskeletal health. Chronic pain often induces sensitization or wind- up which produces generalized pain that is poorly localized and is often disassociated from the initial inciting injury. In humans, massage therapy, joint mobilization and manipulation are often used to address chronic pain syndromes and compensa- tory gait mechanisms (i.e., antalgic gait). In horses, massage therapy has been shown to be effective for reducing stress-related behavior8 and lowering mechanical nociceptive thresholds within the tho- racolumbar region.9 The use of acupuncture evalu- ation techniques to localize reactive loci within su- perficial soft tissues is useful for assessing overall nociceptive thresholds and diagnosing myofascial 2017-18 REPORT 223RESEARCH | FOCUS 5 - Validation of Rehabilitation and Physical Therapy Techniques for Musculoskeletal Disease pain. Acupressure or ischemic compression tech- niques can be used to treat local muscle pain or hypertonic bands (i.e., trigger points).10 Two random- ized, controlled clinical trials using pressure algom- to assess mechanical nociceptive thresholds (MNTs) in the thoracolumbar region of horses have demonstrated that both manual and instrument- as- sisted spinal manipulation can reduce back pain (or increase MNTs).9,11 Stiffness Neck or back stiffness is a common cause of poor performance in sport horses. Stiffness localized to a specific limb articulation is typically due to joint capsule fibrosis or periarticular adhesions. Stiffness can also be produced by pain and muscle guarding associated with osteoarthritis or dorsal spinous pro- cess impingement. Muscle spasms or hypertonicity are common clinical findings in horses with neck of back pain or stiffness.2 Detailed palpation tech- niques provided by manual therapy techniques can help to localize the source of stiffness to the various tissue types and possible pathophysiology of the clinical complaint. All of the individual articulations of the proximal and distal limbs can be mobilized to assess the quali- ty and quantity of joint motion. As isolated joints are moved through full flexion and extension and accessory motions of internal and external rotation or translation, the ease of joint movement and any restrictions or painful responses are noted. A full de- scription of the techniques for joint mobilization are beyond the scope of this chapter, but a simple ex- ample of assessing internal and external rotation of the coffin joint demonstrate asymmetries in the end range of motion. Gentle rotation of the hoof internal- ly and externally helps to determine the quality and quantity of passive axial rotation of the coffin joint as the pastern region is stabilized proximally (Figure 1). Active stretching involves using the patient's own movements to induce a stretch, whereas passive stretches are applied to relaxed muscles or connec- tive tissues during passive soft tissue or joint mo- bilization.3,12 In horses, active stretches of the neck and trunk are often induced with baited (i.e., carrot) stretches with the goal in increasing flexion, exten- sion or lateral bending of the axial skeleton.13 Asking horses to produce active stretching of the limbs is often difficult; therefore, passive stretches are most commonly prescribed in horses.12 In horses, passive stretching exercises of the limbs and axial skeleton have anecdotal effects of increasing stride length and joint range of motion and improving overall comfort.12 In a noncontrolled study, passive thoracic limb stretching lowered wither height due to possi- ble relaxation of the fibromuscular thoracic girdle.14 However, a randomized controlled trial in riding school horses evaluating the effect of two different Fig. 1. Joint mobilization of the coffin joint in internal (A) and external (B) rotation. Note the reduced or asymmetric end range of motion induced during external rotation, compared with internal rotation (white lines). 224 ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH CENTERRESEARCH | FOCUS 5 - Validation of Rehabilitation and Physical Therapy Techniques for Musculoskeletal Disease 8-week passive stretching programs reported no significant changes in stride length at the trot but had a detrimental effect of decreasing joint range of motion within the shoulder, stifle, and hock artic- ulations.15 The focus of recent equine chiropractic research has been on assessing the clinical effects of spinal mobilization and manipulation on pain relief, improv- ing flexibility, reducing muscle hypertonicity, and re- storing spinal motion symmetry. Spinal mobilization has been shown to be effective at increasing spinal flexibility in ridden horses without clinical signs of back pain.9 Manipulation may preferentially stimu- late receptors within deep intervertebral muscles, while mobilization techniques most likely affect more superficial axial muscles. Only one study has compared mobilization to manipulation in horses and spinal manipulation induced a 15% increase in displacement and a 20% increase in applied force, compared to mobilization.16 At most vertebral sites studied, manipulation increased the amplitudes of dorsoventral displacement and applied force, indic- ative of increased spinal flexibility and increased tolerance to pressure in the thoracolumbar region of the equine vertebral column. Manually-applied forces associated with chiroprac- tic techniques are able to produced substantial seg- mental spinal motion.17 Additional studies have as- sessed the effects of equine chiropractic techniques on increasing passive spinal mobility (i.e., flexibili- ty)9,16 and reducing longissimus muscle tone.18 The effect of manipulation on asymmetrical spinal move- ment patterns in horses with documented back pain suggest that chiropractic treatment elicits slight but significant changes in thoracolumbar and pelvic ki- nematics and that some of these changes are likely to be beneficial.19,20 Equine osteopathic evaluation and treatment proce- dures have been described in textbooks and case reports, but no formal hypothesis-driven research exists.21,22 A case series of 51 horses with chronic lameness or gait abnormalities that were poorly lo- calized were treated with osteopathic techniques under sedation and had reported positive results in the majority of case from 6 to 12 months after treat- ment.23Weakness Weakness (i.e., lack of muscular strength) is a com- mon but poorly recognized or easily localized dis- order. The etiology of weakness is often neurolog- ic-based but clinically we often attribute weakness to muscular disorders due to the lack of epaxial muscle development, inability to perform advanced training techniques, asymmetrical movement pat- terns (e.g., not bend to the left) or difficulty in clear- ing a jump. The most common cause of weakness is reflex inhibition due to soft tissue or orthopedic pain. A lame horse is that is unable or unwilling to place full weight bearing on a limb also has distinct changes in muscle activation (i.e., timing and ampli- tude of contractions). Muscles that have altered tim- ing can include individual muscles that turn on too early or stay active too long or do not turn on at all. Muscles also have changes in the number of motor units activated, which directly correlates to the am- plitude or strength of muscle contraction. A horse with a painful back often has accompanying mus- cle hypertonicity of varying degrees, which alters the resting muscle tone and threshold for muscle activation. A common misconception is that a hyper- tonic or muscle spasm is a \"strong\" muscle; howev- er, due to chronic activation it is often a very weak muscle with altered on-and-off timing that increases the risk of injury. Chronic pain often induces recruit- ment of peripheral or proximal limb muscles which we interpret clinically as altered gait patterns. Neu- rogenic atrophy can be noted locally within a seg- mentally-innervated myotome and varying degrees of disuse atrophy may be noticed more regionally over the lateral neck or dorsal trunk in horses with chronic neck or back pain. Motor control Manual forces are used to induce passive stretch- ing, weight-shifting or activation of spinal reflexes, which help to increase flexibility, stimulate proprio- ception and strengthen core musculature.13,24 Soft tissue mobilization has the additional effect of stim- ulating regional or systemic changes in neurologic signaling related to pain processing and motor con- trol. Joint mobilization and manipulation can provide effective management of pain and neuromuscular deficits associated with musculoskeletal injuries, alterations in postural control, and locomotory is- sues related to antalgic or compensatory gait. In re- 2017-18 REPORT 225RESEARCH | FOCUS 5 - Validation of Rehabilitation and Physical Therapy Techniques for Musculoskeletal Disease sponse to chronic pain or stiffness, new movement patterns are developed by the nervous system and adopted in an attempt to reduce pain or discom- fort. Long after the initial injury has healed, adaptive or secondary movement patterns may continue to persist, which predispose adjacent articulations or muscles to injury. Activation of proprioceptors, no- ciceptors, and components of the muscle spindles provide afferent stimuli that have direct and wide- spread influences on components of the peripheral and central nervous systems that directly regulate muscle tone and movement patterns. The various forms of manual therapy are thought to affect differ- ent aspects of joint function via diverse mechanical and neurologic mechanisms. Conclusions The goals of neuromuscular rehabilitation are to: 1) identify the individual muscle or muscle groups involved; 2) diagnose the underlying cause of muscular dysfunction (or neurologic or muscular disease); 3) define the rehabilitation issue relevant for that horse on that day (i.e., timing or amplitude); 4) develop and implement a focused rehabilita- tion plan to address the specific needs of the individual patient; and 5) provide objective outcome measures to assess accomplishment of goals and eventual return to optimal function.
