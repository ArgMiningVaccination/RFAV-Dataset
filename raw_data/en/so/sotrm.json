Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, these events transitioned from in -person to virtual. This study seeks to describe the outcomes of this transition and compare results to previous in -person events. METHODS F our rural Kansas counties offered virtual Baby Showers. Participants were emailed the pre -survey. Once complete, educational materials were provided (videos, live -strea m, or digital documents), followed by the post -survey. Those who completed both surveys received a portable crib and wearable blanket. Within group comparisons were assessed between pre - and post -surveys; between group comparisons assessed post -surveys for virtual compared to previous in- person events. RESULTS Bas ed on data from 74 virtual and 143 in -person participants, virtual participants were more likely to be married (p <0.001), have private insurance (p <0.001), and less likely to report tobacco use (p <0.001). Both event formats significantly increased knowledge and intentions regarding safe sleep and avoidance of second -hand smoke (all p 0.001). Breastfeeding intentions did not change. Differences were observed between virtual and in -person participants regarding confidence in ability to avoid second - hand smoke (72% vs 84%; p = 0.031), intention to breastfeed 6 months (79% vs 62%; p = 0.008) and confidence in ability to breastfeed 6 months (64% vs 47%; p = 0.018). DISCUSSI ON While both event formats demonstrated increase knowledge/intentions to follow safe sleep recommendations, virtual events may further marginalize groups who are high risk for poor birth outcomes. Strategies to increase technology access, recruit priority populations , and en sure disparities are not enhanced will be critical for implementation of future virtual events. Cari Schm idt, Medicine Poster ID: KUMCW30 The Relative Influence of the Resident and Attending in Antibiotic Ordering Speed in Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock Robert Badgett , M.D.1, Nima of Kansas Medical Center-K ansas City INTRODUCTION Recognizing heterogeneity in healthcare delivery - and the 'bright spots' within the heterogeneity - creates new opportuni ties to improve medical care and education using positive deviance methods. In this initial study of patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, we quantified the heterogeneity and relative impact of the resident and attending physicians in the antibiotic ordering time (AOT). METHODS We studied all patients with severe sepsis or septic shock over three months in 2020 in the Emergency Department at the University of Kansas Hospital. First, we measured the heterogeneity in care by calculating the I 2 values for the residents and attendings who had at least two cases. Lastly, restricting to physicians who cared for at least three patients, we measured the influence of each physician on each patient's AOT by regressing a weight for each physician based on the m ean AOT across all patients that the physician cared for. RESULTS Among 169 patients of any resident type supervised by EM attendings, we found 'considerable' heterogeneity with I 2 of 91%. Among 149 cases managed by EM residents, we found considerable heterogeneity with I 2 of 80%. Limiting to 126 patients whose physicians qualified for the regression analysis, the mean AOT was 98 minutes. Neither the attendings' nor the residents' weights contributed to the variation in patients' AOTs. DISCUSSION In this initial analysis, there was considerable heterogeneity in mean AOT across both resident and attending physicians. These results support the role of positive deviance in identifying and disseminating best resident and attending practices. Robert Badgett , M.D. (620) 314- Statewid e Ad vocacy Collaboration : Kansas for Kari University of Kansas School of Medicine -Wichita INTRODU CTION Public health decisions during the COVID -19 pandemic impact youth and highlight the need for representation of this population. Objective is to create a collaborative team to advocate for the physical and emotional needs of children during and following th e pandemic. METHODS K ansas COVID Workgroup for Kids (KCWK), sponsored by KU Wichita Pediatrics, formed in May 2020. Regional physician leaders served as a steering committee, identified additional members, and determined the mission: \"to identify, address and provide guidance on the physical, social, and emotional impacts on children as related to the pandemic and provide clinical education and community engagement.\" Primary focuses included safe school reopening and emotional wellness. RESULTS K CWK is a geographically diverse, 25 -member workgroup of physicians, county health officers, school nurses, mental health professionals, and child advocates. KCWK partnered with several state organizations including Kansas' State Departments of Education and Health and Environment (KSDE, KDHE), physician and nurse organizations, county health departments, and school districts. Deliverables of KCWK include published guidance on school reopening, gating criteria, and mental health; presentations to Boards of Education; clinical, school-related, and community webinars; multi - institutional research projects; and specific advocacy work regarding clinical guidance, adherence to risk mitigation, vaccine prioritization, and social and health disparities. DISCUSSI ON While there has long been overlap between the education, clinical, and public health sectors, prior to the pandemic, few formal partnerships had been developed in Kansas. The success of KCWK demonstrates these partnerships can and should exist to synergistically su pport one another and strengthen the physical and emotional health of youth. Stepha nie Kuhlmann , 2University of Kansas School of Medicine -Wichita INTRODUCTION Vancomycin nephrotoxicity incidence rate of 33% or higher is reported in the literature when associated with vancomycin troughs over 20 mcg/mL. It remains uncertain and to wha t extent vancomycin is directly responsible for nephrotoxicity. Recent literature suggests that vancomycin nephrotoxicity incidence may be reduced when utilizing area -under -the-curve (AUC) dosing modalities. The aim of this quality improvement project was to decrease vancomycin nephrotoxicity via AUC dosing implementation. METHODS A single -center retrospective observational study was conducted that spanned 24 months. All hospitalized patients who received IV vancomycin who had peak and/or trough levels were included. The dependent count variable selected for pre -post intervention was defined as a supratherapeutic vancomycin trough level of 25.0 mcg/mL or greater, and would serve as the surrogate marker of vancomycin nephrotoxicity. Patients not included wer e those not hospitalized or are on renal- replacement therapies other than hemodialysis. RESULTS Differences in the rates of supratherapeutic vancomycin troughs were analyzed and compared between a 12 -month pre -intervention window and a 12 -month post -inter vention window. The pre -intervention window correlated with 36 supratherapeutic troughs while the post -intervention window corresponded with 4 supratherapeutic troughs. The independent variable selected for exposure was bed days of care. Poisson regression was utilized with the supratherapeutic events over the bed days of care. Pre- intervention and post -intervention windows were 36/8 ,309 and 4/7 ,716, respectively (p < 0.0001). DISCUSSION A marked reduction in the rate of supratherapeutic troughs occurred after implementing AUC dosing. Converting to AUC dosing pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics models could decrease the rate of vancomycin nephrotoxicity and improve patient safety. ID: KUMCW22 Utilizing a Ph ysician's for School of Medicine -Wichita INTRODU CTION We commonly seek advice from peers who seem most confident in their practice; however, Dunning - Kruger would suggest this is the wrong person to ask. Alternatively, positive deviance (PD) fosters learning from peers who objectively perform better. However, we have recognized some physicians are reluctant to participate in PD. The goal of this study is to understand the mindset of p hysicians. This will allow us to develop solutions to their PD concerns. METHODS W e asked Vandewalle's questions that correlated strongest for the three goal- orientation learning -goal (LGO), performance -prove (PPGO), and performance - goal orientation (PAGO). We then compared resident's mindsets to their willingness to share PDs information. RESULTS O f all participants, 28.6% did not support revealing the PDs identity. Of the three mindsets, only PAGO was significantly associated with encouraging the PDs to identify their data (Wilcoxon rank sum p = 0.042). Additionally, we found a tendency that physicians without PAGO preferred not to reveal PDs. DISCUSSI ON In contrast to prior studies, we found that physicians with PAGO are receptive to revealing PDs. These findings (if confirmed by others) suggests that in clinical settings, PAGO supports peer learning. In contrast to findings in the setting of business innovation, we hypothesize that in the setting of patient care PAGO is a desirable state as it may drive peer learning. This study may be limited by how clinicians interpret Vandewalle's PAGO question. Due to contrasting findings, future studies should expand the number of mindset -oriented survey questions. Kevin Wissm M.D. , A. Helpser , M.D. Morris , M.D. , Bernard F. Hearon , M.D. University of Kansas School of Medicine -Wichita INTRODU CTION We investigated the clinical outcomes of patients with acute posttraumatic distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) instability who were treated with our nonsurgical protocol. METHODS T he electronic database of our community -based orthopedic practice was queried to id entify patients with posttraumatic wrist pain and DRUJ instability who presented for treatment less than six weeks after injury. Medical records review defined a cohort of 16 patients treated between November, 2000 and December, 2016 with immobilization of the wrist and elbow for six weeks and gradual return to full activity at six months after injury. Data from the medical records were compiled and analyzed to assess short -term outcomes. Eight patients with a minimum two year follow -up completed questionnaires and underwent a wrist -focused examination to assess long -term outcomes. We used Wilcoxon signed -ranks exact test and McNemar chi -square exact test to confirm the statistical significance of observed trends in key outcome measures. RESULTS A t a mean long- term follow -up of 6.7 years, there was statistically significant improvement in ulnar - sided wrist pain and all eight subjects examined demonstrated a negative dorsopalmar stress test indicating improved DRUJ stability. Analysis of the entire cohort showed that 11 of 16 patients (69%) were overall improved with respect to wrist pain and DRUJ stability at final follow -up evaluation. Ulnar positive variance was a relative contraindication to nonsurgical treatment. DISCUSSI ON Prompt above -elbow immobilization of patients with acute posttraumatic DRUJ instability may result in a goo d clinical outcome without operative treatment. Steve Enge ls, BSN (316) 268- 5463 sengels@kumc.edu 9Category: Department: Poster ID: KUMCW6 Assessing Understanding of ACGME Milestones After Utilizing a School of Medicine -Wichita INTRODU CTION ACGME milestones are utilized to evaluate resident competency. Incoming residents are expected to perform at a certain level upon starting residency, often without being exposed to these milestones during medical school. A milestones checklist was developed and implemented during our 4th year medical student rotation. The aim of this study is to assess and compare knowledge of ACGME milestones among medical students and residents, and checklist utilization. METHODS T his prospective study utilized a cross -sectional web -based survey, admini stered to a convenience sample of current OB- GYN residents at a single institution, and medical students completing a 4th year rotation at our institution within the last two academic years. Survey questions included demographics, utility of a milestones c hecklist, and general knowledge of ACGME milestones. RESULTS O ut of 28 respondents, the majority were 25 - 29 years old (n = 21, 75%) and 53.6% (n = 15) reported their medical school did not teach them about ACGME milestones. Of respondents completing a 4 th year rotation with our program, 75% (15/20) reported using the checklist. The majority reported the checklist was moderately easy or extremely easy to complete (8/15, 53.3%), and more reported being moderately or very knowledgeable about ACGME milestones after completing our rotation (20% vs. 73.3%). Three out of four respondents, who were medical students pursuing a different specialty, reported looking at ACGME milestones for their own specialty as a result of utilizing our checklist. DISCUSSI ON A che cklist is useful for medical students to understand ACGME milestones before residency, regardless of specialty. There is limited exposure to ACGME milestones during medical school. Jennife Poster ID: KUMCW10 Survival and Outcomes of Neonates Born to Women with a History of Stillbirth in a Midwest Maternal Fetal Medicine Clinic: Is Waiting Until 39 Weeks to Deliver Valid ? Kristen Giefer , D.O., School of Medicine -Wichita INTRODU CTION Stillbirth has an incidence of 1/160 deliveries in the United States. Management of pregnancies subsequent to a stillbirth varies. Currently, expert consensus recommends 39 weeks' gestation for timing of delivery in the absence of maternal or fetal complications. This study aims to evaluate outcomes based on timing of delivery following a previous stillbirth. METHODS T his retrospective study included women with a history of stillbirth at a single obstetrical clinic from January 1, 2010 to October 31, 2020. Cases were identified using ICD -9 and ICD -10 codes indicating previous stillbirth. The primary outcome was live birthrate, determined by APGAR score at one minute after delivery greater than 0. Data were abstracted from electronic medical records. Patients with missing delivery data were excluded. RESULTS O f 150 patients reviewed, 103 were included. The majority were white (n = 72, 69.9%), had a history of preterm birth (n = 78, 75.7%), and d elivered before 39 weeks' gestation (n = 86, 83.5%). The overall live birthrate was 96.1% (n = 99). Delivery at 39 weeks' gestation or later had a live birthrate of 100%, compared to 95.3% (82/86) for deliveries prior to 39 weeks' gestation (p = 0.4803). O f women delivering before 39 weeks' gestation, 50 (58.1%) were preterm. The distribution of AGPAR scores was significantly different for deliveries before 39 weeks compared to deliveries 39 weeks' gestation or after, at one minute (p = 0.0027) and five minutes (p = 0.0221). DISCUSSI ON There was no difference in live birthrate, nor clinically significant complications, for women with a history of stillbirth when comparing deliveries before 39 weeks' gestation versus after 39 weeks' gestation. Medicine Poster ID: KUMCW 39 An Evaluat ion of Virtual and Hybrid Models for Didactic Education During the COVID -19 Pandemic Ofei-Dodoo , School of Medicine -Wichita INTRODU CTION This study was conducted to evaluate family physicians' perception of in -person, all- virtual, and hybrid (virtual and in -person) models of didactics at a local residency program. METHODS T he authors conducted a survey of 46 family medicine faculty and resident physicians (PGY2/PGY3) between January 12, 2021 and February 22, 2021. The study participants completed an anonymous, 11 - item survey assessing their perce ption of in -person, all -virtual, and hybrid models. A mixed method approach was used to collect, analyze, and interpret the data. Standard descriptive statistics, Fisher's exact tests, and content analysis were used to analyze the data. RESULTS E ighteen f aculty and 27 residents completed the survey. Nearly 85% of all the respondents were very satisfied/satisfied with in -person didactics, 73% were very satisfied/satisfied virtual and 76% were very satisfied/satisfied with hybrid didactic s. The proportion of respondents who were satisfied with the hybrid didactics was significantly higher in those who thought their learning improved than those who thought their learning worsened (100% vs 40%; 2 [1, n = 26] = 6.49.1; p <0 .05). Resident physicians appreciated having recorded lectures to access later, but also indicated difficulty maintaining focus when participating remotely. Faculty presenters struggled to gauge learner comprehension virtually. Both residents and faculty appreci ated participating from flexible locations, but also perceived a loss of community. DISCUSSI ON Family physicians' positive perception of virtual and hybrid didactics should be reassuring to graduate medical education as training has not been negatively af fected during the global COVID -19 pandemic. Respondents' appreciated increased flexibility at the cost of a sense of connection. Theresia Go rdnier , Novel Radioulnar Joint Instability Elizabeth A. , Frantz , M.D. Adams , BGS, Morris , M.D. , Bernard F. Hearon , M.D. University of Kansas School of Medicine -Wichita INTRODU CTION This retrospective study investigated the clinical outcomes of patients treated for chronic distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) instability with arthroscopic thermal annealing of superficial radioulnar ligaments, ulnar palmar wrist ligaments, and dorsoulnar wrist capsule using a radiofrequency probe. METHODS W e identified a cohort of 60 patients (62 wrists) treated for DRUJ instability with our arthroscopic thermal shrinkage technique during an 18 -year period. Demographic and clinical data from medical records were compiled in an electronic database. Patient volun teers were enrolled in our research protocol to assess long -term clinical outcomes using standardized questionnaires and wrist -focused physical examination. Primary outcome measures were ulnar wrist pain quantified on visual analog scale and DRUJ laxity determined by dorsopalmar stress test. RESULTS A t mean long- term follow -up of 10 years (range 3 to 19), 30 of the 33 patients we studied were satisfied with their surgical outcomes. There were statistically significant improvements in ulnar wrist pain and DRUJ stability after surgery compared with preoperative status. Outcomes based on the modified Mayo Wrist Score were stratified as 3 excellent, 13 good, 10 fair, and 1 poor. Early failure occurred in 11 of the original 62 -wrist cohort. Nine of the 11 n eeded a secondary procedure. DISCUSSI ON We conclude that arthroscopic thermal annealing is effective for the majority of the patients with mild to moderate chronic DRUJ instability in long-term follow -up. Secondary open ligament reconstruction is an opti on in the case of early failure. Elizabeth H elsper , M.D. (605) 695- 3536 ehelsper@kumc.edu ID: KUMCW7 Medicole gal Study: Assessing Physician Knowledge and 2Wesley Medical Center INTRODU CTION Physicians involved in lawsuits often report higher levels of burnout, depression , and suicidal ideation. It is reported that defensive medicine practices increase the cost of healthcare by billions of dollars each year. Medicolegal education has the potential to be highly beneficial to improve knowledge, wellness , and decrease overall healthcare costs, but is often unstructured or self- directed. The aim of this study is to assess medicolegal knowledge and physician competency of practices that reduce the risk of litigation. METHODS T his prospective study utilized a cross -sectional web -based survey administered to a convenience sample of current resident and faculty physicians of a large midwestern hospital associated with the local medical university. Survey questions included demographi cs, knowledge of medicolegal topics, confidence in documentation , and risk -mitigation. Responses were included if any knowledge questions were answered. RESULTS O f 86 respondents, 81.4% were included in the analysis ( n = 70). More respondents were attend ings (n = 42, 60%). Fifty- six (80%) reported practicing a high -risk subspecialty. The majority of respondents reported some training on medicolegal topics (n = 52, 74.3%). Fifty- four respondents (77.1%) scored less than 75% of the knowledge questions correctly. Of those scoring less than 75% of the knowledge questions correctly, 85.7% (24/28) were residents and 71.4% (30/42) were attendings. Of respondents reporting prior medicolegal training, 25% (13/52) answered at least 75% of knowledge questions correctly. DISCUSSI ON There is a gap in education regarding medicolegal topics in the medical community, despite self-reported training. More structured training and education covering basic medicolegal topics such as proper documentation and the process of a la wsuit may be beneficial. Jennife r Poster ID: KUMCW8 Use of St ructured Teaching Material and Topics to Improve Resident and Medical Student Interactions Jordan Meyer , M.D. , Jennifer Keomany , MPH , Taylor of Medicine -Wichita INTRODU CTION Residents spend 25% of their time teaching students, and both students and residents have reported enjoying these experiences. However, resident physicians receive little guidance when teaching medical students, which results in medical students feeling disconnected. The aim of this study is to assess whether utilization of structured teaching materials will enhance resident teaching with medical students. METHODS T his is a prospective study utilizing cross -sectional surveys during the pilot phase after introducing the use of structured teaching materials for one month. This is a survey study using a convenience sample of 19 resident physicians in one obstetrics and gynecology program. The primary outcome will be residents' preparedness, and time spent with medical students. Secondary outcomes will be quality of interactions and preparedness of medical students. RESULTS S eventeen residents consented to participate, and 16 residents complete both the initial and first monthly survey. More than a third of residents reported not having any training on teaching medical students (76. 5%, 13 of 17). One -third of respondents reported using the structured teaching modules often or sometimes (31.3%, 5 of 16). More residents agreed with the statement \"I feel prepared to teach medical students\" at baseline (70.6% vs. 68.8%). After implementing teaching modules, fewer residents reported spending four or more times a week engaging in teaching sessions lasting 10 minutes or more (29.4% vs. 12.5%). DISCUSSI ON Structured teaching modules did not improve resident preparedness or time spent teaching. Additional research should investigate the content of resident teaching discussions, and how best to improve teaching modules. Jennife r Nentwig, M.D.1, Paul Harrison , M.D.2, Injury Outcomes Network Collaborators 1University of Kansas School of Medicine -Wichita , 2Wesley Medical Center INTRODU CTION Hip fracture surgery in geriatric patients on anticoagulants may increase the risk for blood loss. Anticoagulation reversal may lower these risks; however, data on blood loss and transfusions are limited. Study purpose was to compare outcomes between hip fracture patients 1) not on anticoagulants 2) whose anticoagulants were reversed, and 3) whose anticoagulants were not reversed. METHODS F our-year retrospective cohort study at six Level 1 Trauma Centers enrolled geriatric patients >65 with isolated hip fractures. Primary outcome was total hospital blood loss (ml). Secondary outcomes: hospital length of stay (HLOS) and volume of packed red blood cells (pRBC) transfusions (ml). Statistical analyses included: Fisher's, chi -squared, Kruskal -Wallis, linear mixed- effect and logistic regression. Bonferroni adjusted alpha = 0.025. RESULTS O f the 459 patients, 189 (41%) were not on anticoagulants, 186 (41%) were reversed, and 84 (18%) were not reversed. Mean blood loss was 134 ml for not reversed patients and 159 ml for reversed patients; no significant difference compared to those not on anticoagulants [138 ml], p = 0.14 and 0.83, respectively. The mean HLOS was significantly longer for the reversed patients, 7.7 days, compared to those not on anticoagulants, 6.8 days, p = 0.02, and compared to those not reversed, 6.3 days, p = 0.01. There was no significant difference in pRBC transfusions. DISCUSS ION Not reversing anticoagulants for geriatric hip fractures was not associated with increased volume of blood loss or transfusions when compared to those reversed. Delayed surgery for anticoagulant reversal may be unnecessary and contributing to an increa sed HLOS. Steve Enge ls, T reatment , Jennifer Keomany , MPH , Kevin Miller, M.D. University of Kansas School of Medicine -Wichita INTRODU CTION The most common surgical option to treat stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in females is a midurethral sling (MUS). Vaginal mesh exposure complicates approximately 2 - 3% of cases. Mesh erosion or perforation into the urethra or bladder, is even less common. Our objective is to report a case series of urethral mesh perforations, and describe the presentation, subsequent management , and outcomes. METHODS W e conducted an IRB approved, retrospective cohort study of women referred to a single, private female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery clinic, who underwent evaluation and treatment for mesh perforation into the urethra. Patients were identified by CPT codes for MUS and pelvic mesh removal, endoscopic, and open urethral procedures. Patients were included if sling removal was performed from October 1, 2010 to December 31, 2018. RESULTS O f 207 patients, nine (4.3%) were identified as cases of urethral mesh perforation. Seven (77.8%) patients presented with symptoms of incontinence and two (22.2%) with urinary retention. Eight (88.9%) patients underwent complete excision, and one underwent endoscopic partial excision. Five (55.6%) cases of the initial MUS placed were performed by the same surgeon, and early reoperation occurred in two of these cases. The presence o f calculi in either the bladder or urethra was present in two (22.2%) cases. DISCUSSI ON Half of cases had one common surgeon, suggesting flaws in surgical technique. In women with a history of MUS placement, symptoms of incontinence and retention, presenc e of lower urinary tract stones, and history of early sling revision should raise suspicion of urethral mesh perforation. Pediatrics Poster ID: KUMCW41 Cloth Ma sk with Window as an Alternative to Opaque Mask for Students with Speech, Language, and Hearing Deficits During COVID -Wichita , State University INTRODU CTION In 2018 - 2019, 19% of students receiving special education utilized SLS. Because visualization of the oral movement and facial expressions is important for learning, and communication among these students, this study sought to investigate the effectiveness of cloth face masks with transparent window as an alternative to opaque masks . METHODS P articulate matter was delivered to a testing pipe with air flow velocity that mimicked human breathing. The pipe was fitted with the face mask. Particle size and airflow were measured using three real- time particle monitors both upstream and downstream of the face mask. Filter efficiency of the masks was calculated. RESULTS M edical N -95 and grade 1 surgical masks were used for comparisons and performed superior than all other masks tested. The filter efficiencies of all four FMW (E -H) varied from 28.6% to 90% with the single -layer FMW performing the worst. Overall, filter efficiency for all multi- layer face masks with windows was greater than 70% for all particle sizes tested.

Collaborative Care Models (CCMs) such as Pediatric Mental Health Care Access programs and Child Psychiatry Access Projects increase access to pediatric psychiatric care. While there is well- established literature supporting CCMs, the organizational structure varies. Understanding characteristics of existing programs would facilitate planning efforts in communities seeking to increase access to pediatric psychiatric care. METHODS A descriptive analysis of publicly available program data. RESULTS A total of 21 CCMs programs were reviewed. Objectives varied; however, all shared the goal of empowering PCPs to provide mental health care. Most (76%; n = 16) targeted workforce development (e.g. PCPs) while 14.3% (n = 5) also provided direct patient care. Only 39% (n = 8) reported expert team membership; of those, programs averaged 9.4 (SD = 5.7) members. Six of the eight programs included a child psychiatrist and four included child psychologists . In addition to federal funding, programs were supported by state health departments, children and family service programs, mental health agencies, university collaborations, and foundation grants. DISCUSSI ON The findings reflect the multidisciplinary nature of the PMHCA teams and the common goal of improving access to pediatric mental health care. Program websites did not follow a standardized template which created a barrier to understanding composition of the expert teams. Few programs specified partic ipation of board- certified child psychiatrists or psychologists and many did not include participant expertise. Further research is needed to understand ideal composition of the PMHCA teams and the impacts of program success.

KUMCW19 Qualitative Assessment of Access to Perinatal Mental Health Care : Social- Ecological Framework of Barriers Deborah Tyokighir, M.D.1, Ashley Medicine -Wichita , 2Center for Research for Infant Birth and Survival, 3Kansas Infant Death and SIDS (KIDS) Network , 4Sedgwick County Health Department INTRODU CTION Psychological distress affects up to 25% of women during pregnancy and is associated with p oor birth outcomes. Identifying barriers to accessing perinatal mental health support is an important step in mitigating the adverse effects of maternal psychological distress. This project aimed to triangulate themes from interviews with key stakeholders regarding knowledge of and barriers to mental health services in the perinatal period. METHODS S tudy personnel conducted interviews with pregnant or recently delivered women, primary care providers , and mental health providers until saturation of themes w as reached within each group. Interviews were transcribed, independently reviewed using grounded theory and themes were stratified using the social -ecological model framework. RESULTS T hirty -three interviews were conducted, 36% with pregnant or recently delivered women, 45% PCPs (five obstetrics/gynecologists, six pediatricians, four family physicians) and 18% perinatal mental health providers. The most cited barriers identified by women were at the individual level (e.g. transportation, childcare, scheduling, cost, and lack of knowledge of resources). Providers identified barriers at all social- ecological levels, including those identified by women. Themes across provider groups found consistency in identification of lack of support at the interpersonal level; poor communication between providers at the organizational level; and Medicaid limitations at the public policy level. DISCUSSI ON Individual level themes , including cost/lack of insurance and transportation , were consistent across groups; however , women only identified barriers at this level. Providers elucidated barriers at all levels of the social-ecological model. Multi-level Interventions are needed to improve access to mental health care for low -income women in the perinatal per ID: KUMCW33 Targeted Te mperature Management Linked with Neurological Recovery in Post -Cardiac Arrest Patients Regardless of Rhythm -Type: A of Kansas School of Medicine -Wichita INTRODU CTION Targeted temperature management (TTM) has shown variable results in neurological outcome in patients after a cardiac arrest. We explore neurological benefit with at- least 12 hours of in -hospital TTM post -cardiac arrest regardless of the rhythm -type at the time of arrest. METHODS T his is a living meta- analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of TTM in adults after a cardiac arrest exploring neur ological outcomes. Cited references of existing studies were further screened for relevant RCTs on Google Scholar. Trials comparing at least 12 hours of in -hospital TTM to usual care were included. Random effects model (Hartung- Knapp) was used to estimate the pooled risk ratio. The I2 statistic estimates the heterogeneity and the funnel plot asymmetry was tested. RESULTS Th e pooled risk ratio (RR) for neurological recovery favoring TTM is estimated at 1.52 [95% CI 1.10 CI: 0% to 77%)). The test for funnel asymmetry was not statistically significant, p = 0.17. DISCUSSI ON This updated meta -analysis of available RCTs indicates 52% relative increase in neurological recovery with TTM after cardiac arrest in adults, not limited to any initial rhythm. Limitations to our findings include : 1) three studies contribute 86% to the meta -analysis ; 2) intervention with hemofiltration in the control arm for the Laurent, 2005 study ; 3) temperature check and cooling methods were inconsistent across the RCTs ; 4) varying definition of the neurological outcome across studies ; and 5) our exploratory approach in determining inclusion criteria for the RCTs included in our analysis. Rhythm Va sudeva , vs. D elayed Mobilization Postoperative Protocols for Lateral Ankle Ligament Repair: A Systematic Review of Kansas Medical Center-K ansas City, 3University of Connecticut Health Center INTRODU CTION A proportion of patients with an acute lateral ankle ligamentous injury require surgical intervention. Optimal rehabilitation after lateral ankle ligament repair remains in debate. The purpose of this study was to compare early and delayed mobilization (EM and DM, respectively) postoperative protocols in patients undergoing primary lateral ankle ligament repair to determine optimal evidence -based rehabilitation recommendations. METHODS F ollowing the PRISMA guidelines, a meta- analysis using the PubMed database was performed (1947 to 2017), searching for articles involving lateral ankle ligament repair. Postoperative protocols were divided into two categories: EM (within three weeks of surgery) and DM (more than three weeks post -surgery). Return to sport (RTS), outcome scores, radiographic outcomes (talar tilt and anterior drawer), and complications of both populations were statistically analyzed. RESULTS A total of 28 studies comprising 1 ,457 patients who underwent primary lateral ankle ligament repair was analyzed. The postoperative outcom e scores were significantly greater in the EM versus DM group ( p < 0.001). However, the EM group had significantly greater postoperative laxity on both the anterior drawer test and talar tilt test ( p < 0.001). Also, the DM group had significantly lower rat es of overall complications (3.1% vs 11.4%, p < 0.001). RTS was not significantly different between groups ( p = 0.100). DISCUSSI ON Patients with EM postoperative protocols demonstrated improved functional outcome. However, the EM group had increased objec tive laxity and a higher complication rate. Additional randomized studies are needed to definitively evaluate early versus delayed rehabilitation protocol timetables to optimize functional outcomes without compromising long-term stability.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) states that effective hand sanitizers contain greater than 60% ethanol or 70% isopropyl alcohol. Using a procedure inspired by Jie Zhang and Agilent Technologies, different brands of ethanol and isopropyl- based hand sanitizers were tested to confirm the effectiveness based on composition. METHODS Seven different comm ercially -available samples of hand sanitizer were diluted to lower viscosities. Standards of ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, glycerin, methanol, and n -propanol were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and prepared. Acetonitrile was used as an internal standard to assist in quantifying the results given by the chromatogram. Calibration curves were made from the alcohols to quantify the relative responses. The hand sanitizers and standards were then analyzed using an Agilent 6850 gas chromatograph. The results were comp ared to the chromatograms of the standards to identify the different chemical components. RESULTS This study expected to find a marginal discrepancy of <1% between the experimentally -observed and the advertised concentrations of the active ingredients. This means that the study can confirm the accuracy of the label as well as ensure the sanitizer's effectiveness to meet the FDA's minimum requirement. DISCUSSION The data proves that the alcohols' respective labeled concentrations are accurate. If time were not a limit, degradation of the hand sanitizers' active ingredient could be evaluated to determine its effectiveness over time. Maricar Harris , M.A. Ed.

This research provides an overview of current scientific literature about the genetic map of SARS -CoV-2, the pathology of COVID -19, the neurological manifestations of acute disease, the effect on cancer patients, and the vaccine and treatment landscape. METHODS Research was conducted using articles from online scientific journals. A \"rabbit hole\" technique was implemented, wherein each subsequent article built upon information from the last. Through this, each member specialized in a single element while collectively casting the widest net possible. RESULTS Viral genetics provide insight into COVID -19's protein structure, infection mechanism, and evolutionary pathway. CD8+ cells, neutrop hils, and inflammatory cytokines contribute to severe disease progression. As a particularly susceptible group, cancer patients with the virus have had to abandon their immunosuppressive treatments. Neurological manifestations correlate to increased mortality, especially in older patients. The mRNA vaccine increases antigen T-cells and thereby proves the vaccine's efficacy. Mathematical models are shown to be helpful in choosing vaccine rollout plans. Additional treatments, like Auranofin and zinc, minimize COVID -induced cytokine storms, reduce inflammation, and enhance lung response. DISCUSSION The novelty of COVID -19 leaves a high level of uncertainty regarding all research, and the accepted doctrine could change as more data comes to light. The research presented on this poster provides a scaffolding for understanding future studies on these aspects of COVID -19. Maricar Harris , M.A. Ed. Tissue Regeneration Derived Cells , 2University of Kansas School of Medicine -Wichita INTRODUCTION A novel population of cells from adult mammal peripheral nerves has recently been identified to express embryonic stem cell markers (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c -Myc) when the nerve is physically inj ured. This population of stem -like cells is named Nerve -Derived Adult Pluripotent Stem (NEDAPS) cells. The objectives of this study intend to investigate the potential of NEDAPS cells in skin wound healing, and to identify the precursor of NEDAPS cells. METHODS NEDAPS cells retrieved from BMP -2 challenged mouse sciatic nerves were cultured for induction to fibroblastic cells in growth medium containing rhFGF -2 for five days. NEDAPS cells and their induced fibroblasts were labeled with PKH26 Red Fluorescent cell membrane linkers prior to being applied onto fresh skin wounds (0.5cm diameter) at back of Balb/c mice. The wounds were measured daily for 14 days till sacrifice. Healing skin was frozen sectioned for bench tests. RESULTS The fluorescent labeled cells are present at the healing sites. Interestingly, the wounds with NEDAPS cell application were the fastest in healing, even better than induced fibroblast treatment. Statistical significance was observed between NEDAPS and non -cell controls groups. In v itro test also revealed that NEDAPS cells expressed Schwann cell makers S100 and MPZ at first 48 hours isolated from the damaged nerve. DISCUSSION The data provide evidence that the newly identified NEDAPS cells may originated from Schwann cells, which can survive and participate in skin wound healing. The de -differentiation and re -differentiation potentials of Schwann cells warrant further investigation for potential therapeutic means. Morgan , B.S. ID: KUMCW12 Workfor ce Wellbeing and Hospital Mortality : Integrated Care of South Carolina INTRODU CTION Many previous studies of the state of a healthcare organization's workforce and performance have focused on the role of burnout. The role of positive organizational states has not been well studied in healthcare. We examined the association of positive organizational states, staff engagement , and recommending one's employer, in compa rison to burnout on inpatient mortality. METHODS A panel study of 146 English acute and combined Trusts participating in the National Health Service (NHS) Staff Surveys, 2012 - 2019. We measured three factors: workforce engagement, employees' recommendati on of their own hospital ('recommendation'), and burnout using the NHS Survey. Hospital performance was measured using the Summary Hospital- level Mortality Indicator (SHMI). Univariable spline analysis , were performed in order to assess direction of causation and nonlinear relationships. RESULTS I n univariable regression, all factors significantly and negatively correlated with SHMI. In univariable spline regression, engagement and recommendation significantly improved upon linear regression. In multivariable, cross -lagged spline analysis, only recommendation and burnout were significant with recommendation having non -linear effect on SHMI. The heterogeneity of engagement, recommend ation, and burnout were (> 75%) at 89%, 99%, and 92% respectively. DISCUSSI ON Higher workforce engagement, recommendation, and unexpectedly higher burnout are associated with improved performance. The relationships are complex, nonlinear, and suggest that organizations should measure multiple workforce states to optimize achieving organizational missions. The interaction between recommendation and engagement suggest that recommendation may have diminished engagement in this analysis. Heterogeneity in workforce well -being suggests an opportunity to share best management tactics.

The coronavirus pandemic led to suspension of these activities at our institution. Alternative virtual-based programs to fill this gap were lacking. A virtual surgical experience with associated video on sterile technique was implemented in place of in -person clinical surgical experiences. The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of in -person and virtual -based surgical education programs to educate pre -clinical medical students about surgical competencies . METHODS F irst-year medical students participated in either a virtual (Group A) or in -person (Group B) week -long surgical enrichment program at The University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City, Wichita, and Salina. Modality assignments for groups were dictated by COVID protocols at each site. For this observational study, the study design included two surveys, a standard pre - and post -intervention survey. Both surveys included a fourteen -question multiple -choice assessment of surgical knowledge. Paired Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests were performed to assess score improvement for both groups. Mann- Whitney -U tests were performed to assess differences between groups in score improvement. RESULTS Th ere were 14 participants in Group A and 7 in Group B. Both groups improved significantly f rom first to second assessment scores (Group A, p = 0.01; Group B, p = 0.04). There was no difference between groups (p = 0.59) in improvement in surgical knowledge scores after the surgical educational experience. DISCUSSI ON This study demonstrates that virtual- based surgical programs for pre -clerkship students may be comparable to in -person experiences as measured by a multiple -choice assessment of surgical knowledge acquisition.

Kilway, Ph.D., Terence Mciff, Ph.D. University of Kansas Medical Center- Kansas City INTRODUCTION PMMA -based bone cements are the industry standard in orthopedics for implant anchorage, weight - bearing spacers and local delivery of antibiotics. We hypothesize that a novel silorane -base d cement will be comparable or superior to PMMA regarding the elution of vancomycin and rifampin antibiotics, and the incorporation of these will not weaken the silorane composite. METHODS SmartSet MV was used as the PMMA cement, and silorane was synthesized and prepared by the chemistry department at UMKC. Three groups of each cement were formulated into 6 X 12 mm pellets: one without additive, and one each with either 1 g of rifampin or vancomycin. A sample size of 10 was used for each group and elutions were obtained every day for 14 days comparing antibiotic concentrations. Additionally, statistical analyses comparing compressive strength and modulus were conducted. RESULTS The silorane -based samples released 2450% more rifampin than PMMA over 14 days and 50.6% more vancomycin (p <0.001). Additionally, the PMMA samples were significantly weakened by the incorporation of rifampin into the cement, with no observed impact to the silorane cement. DISCUSSION Elution results suggest silorane is a superior carrier of rifampin than PMMA over a 14 day period. They also display superiority regarding vancomycin elution, specifically in the initial three days. The tendency of rifampin to undergo radical scavenging during PMMA polymerization significantly decreases compressive strength of the material, making it unfit as a weight -bearing material in orthopedics. Conversely, the silorane cement maintained its compressive strength regardless of KUMCW21 Evaluation of PMMA and a Novel Silorane -Based Cement as a Carrier for Chemotherapy Agents Grahmm Funk , 2University of Missouri-Kansas City INTRODUCTION Osteosarcoma and other types of bone cancers often require bone resection , with PMMA bone cements being used to fill the void. Currently, local delivery of chemotherapeutic agents with radical scavenging qualities from bone cement has yet to be fully researched. Doxorubicin, a free radical scavenger, contains a hydroquinone structure that has been shown to interfere with PMMA polymerization. A novel silorane -based cement, previously used in dentistry applications, has been reformulated for orthopedic use. The aim of this study is to assess both PMMA and silorane cement's ability to elute doxorubicin and maintain suitable weight -bearing applicability. METHODS SmartSet MV was used as the PMMA bone cement, while the silorane cement was synthesized in the laboratory. Two PMMA groups, one control; one with 200mg of doxorubicin, as we ll as two silorane groups, one control; one with doxorubicin, were created such that the weight percentage of drug incorporated into each experimental mixture was equal. These cements were formed into 6 x 12 mm pellets for testing, per ASTM F451. Elution f rom doxorubicin -containing groups were analyzed via HPLC while compressive strength and modulus were determined for unsoaked specimens. Additionally, MTT assays were done using an MG63 osteosarcoma cell line. RESULTS Both cements were able to elute doxoru bicin in clinically favorable quantities; however, the PMMA pellets showed a reduction in compressive strength, as well as an elevated LD50 on MTT assay. DISCUSSION In conclusion, both PMMA and silorane -based cements can deliver doxorubicin. Doxorubicin, however, interacts chemically with PMMA, inhibiting ID: KUMCW15 Relati onship Between Smoking Cessation and Socioeconomic Status in Smokers in the Kansas City Metropolitan Area Joshua Kasef f, MS-3, Morgan G. Brucks, Vlad B. Papa, Andrew T. Fox, Ph.D., Laura E. Martin , Ph.D. University of Kansas Medical Center-K ansas City INTRODU CTION Almost 40 million Americans smoke, leading to almost 480,000 premature deaths. Individuals with lower socioeconomic status have a higher prevalence of smoking and lower rates of cessation, higher levels of nicotine dependence, and higher levels of impuls ive decision -making. Behavioral economics studies of smoking cessation indicate that impulsive decision -making may be associated with better treatment outcomes. Delayed discounting measures impulsive decision -making behavior by testing an individual's desire to choose an immediate reward of lesser value over a greater reward later. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between socioeconomic status and impulsivity in smokers. METHODS A secondary analysis study was performed on 27 individuals enrolled in a randomized clinical trial with reliable delay discounting data. Socioeconomic status was scored utilizing education, gross income , and IQ. Two measures of impulsivity were examined: 1) impulsive decision making (i.e. delay discoun ting) and 2) self -report impulsivity (i.e. Barratt Impulsivity Score). In addition, correlations between impulsivity, socioeconomic status, and nicotine dependence (i.e. Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence scale) were examined. RESULTS A significant P earson correlation between delayed discounting and socioeconomic status in smokers. This study included 27 subjects with a R value = 0.487, p = 0.01. The Barrett and fTND did not show a significant correlation with socioeconomic status. DISCUSSI ON The cor relation between delayed discounting and socioeconomic status in smoker s suggest an association between smokers with lower socioeconomic status and higher rates of impulsive decision - making. These results may provide insight into why lower socioeconomic s mokers are less likely to achieve cessation.

The primary objectives of this study were to calculate the number of attending hand -offs, the attending encounter time, and the total number of providers participating in care for all admitted patients at a tertiary urban medical center. METHODS T his was a retrospective chart review of 200 patients who were admitted to and discharged from Ascension Via Christi St. Francis hospital in Wichita, Kansas between November 1, 2019 to January 31, 2020. Data abstracted included patient demographics, provider type, and provider specialty. Hand -offs and encounter duration were abstracted for attending physicians. RESULTS D ata were abstracted from two hundred patient charts. Most patients were female and mean patient age was 61 years. Most patients were admitted to the surgical service and had a mean length of stay of four days. Attending physicians comprised 15.0% (n = 304) of all providers; the most common attending specialties were hospital medicine and general surgery. There was an average of two attending physicians (SD = 1.0, range 1 - 6) and one hand -off (SD = 1.0) between attending physicians for all patients. Consultant physicians were the most frequent provider (46.9%, n = 952); the most common consultant specialt ies were diagnostic radiology, anesthesiology, and cardiology. DISCUSSI ON This study serves as a foundational quantitative study of the number of providers and total hand -offs during an -Wichita INTRODU CTION Aortic stenosis (AS) is one of the most common valve diseases among patients undergoing renal replacement therapy. Gold standard therapy for severe AS is surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is currently approved for high, intermediate, and low -risk patients with symptomatic severe AS. The study aimed to compare in -hospital outcomes, including mortality, among renal transplant patients undergoing SAVR or TAVR procedures. METHODS P atients with a previous renal transplant who underwent an in -patient TAVR or SAVR procedure were identified using ICD -10 codes from the Nationwide Readmissions Database for 2016 and 2017. RESULTS A mong 828 hospitalized renal transplant patients, 51.21% underwent SAVR (n = 424) and 48.79% underwent TAVR (n = 404) procedures. Patients undergoing TAVR were older than those undergoing SAVR (means of 69 vs. 59 years). When adjusting for age, sex, and obesity, there was no difference in in - hospital mortality between those undergoing a TAVR (3.96%) and a SAVR (5.19%) procedure (p = 0.39). The median length of stay was shorter for those with a TAVR (3 days) than those with a SAVR (12 days), after adjusting for age, sex, and obesity (p < 0.0001). SAVR was associated with more periprocedural complications than ischemic stroke, acute kidney injury, endocarditis, pericarditis, cardiogenic shock, blood transfusion, aortic dissection, and lower frequency of pacemaker implantations. DISCUSSI ON Patients with a TAVR procedure experienced a shorter length of stay, and less acute kidney injury, endocarditis, pericarditis, cardiogenic shock, blood transfusion, and aortic dissection, but more pacemaker implantation compared to SAVR. In- hospital mortality was the same for both procedures. Jerad Roge rs, MS-2 (316) 616- In-Person Ed ucation During COVID -19 Pandemic at Wichita Collegiate School Adam of Medicine -Wichit a INTRODU CTION The COVID -19 pandemic forced most schools in Kansas to adopt remote or hybrid learning. Wichita Collegiate School proceeded with an in -person teaching model. The purpose of this study was to determine if in -person learning can be done safely during the COVID -19 pandemic. METHODS W ichita Collegiate is a private school located in Sedgwick County. The study population includes 671 students (grades 1 -12) and 130 staff. The procedures implemented for the fall semester (8/20/20 - 12/20/20) i ncluded: mandatory face coverings, six feet physical distancing, and daily temperature checks. A registered nurse performed contact tracing and executed quarantine requirements per the Center for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines . RESULTS O ver the study period, 320 students and staff were tested for COVID -19, and 26% (n = 83) were positive. This correlates to an average rate of 549 new community cases per 100,000 people per week, which is within range for Sedgwick County (54.3 - 614.1) during th e same time period (2). Thorough contract tracing of positive cases revealed that 3.6% (n = 3) individuals were likely exposed to COVID 19 at school. DISCUSSI ON This study suggests that transmission of COVID -19 was infrequent in this setting. As the scho ol followed safety guidelines and conducted vigilant contact tracing, this study suggests that it is possible to limit the spread of COVID -19 during in -person learning. This has immediate implications for how schools might safely return to in -person Honors Student Oral Presentation Post -Strok e Pneumonia : Factors A ssociated with Readmiss ion Within 90 Days of Stroke School of -Wichita , 2Via Christi Regional Medical Center INTRODU CTION Stroke, a leading cause of death and disability in the United States, is frequently followed by medical complications. Post -stroke infections occur in 30% of acute cases, and pneumonia is a risk factor for stroke mortality. Although acute pneumonia is often studied, there is a gap in research focused on post - stroke pneumonia (PSP) as a long -term complication. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify risk and protective factors associated with PSP readmission. METHODS A retrospective chart review was conducted on stroke patients who were admitted to Ascension Via Christi St. Francis in Wichita, Kansas from January 1, 2015 through January 30, 2020. Patients with and without PSP readmission within 90 days of discharge were included in this study. RESULTS O f the 3,952 patients diagnosed with stroke, 1.8% (n = 73) patients were readmitted with PSP. Compared to patients who were not readmitted for PSP, patients with PSP r eadmission were more likely to: use a nasogastric tube during index admission, use mechanical ventilation during index admission, or be placed on a nothing by mouth (NPO) diet at discharge. Being placed on NPO for fluids was also a predictor of PSP readmis sion. Lack of acquired infection during the index admission was a protective factor for PSP readmission. DISCUSSI ON During the index admission, placing patients on NPO for fluids was a predictor of PSP readmission and being infection -free during the index admission was a protective factor. By identifying at -risk patients, clinicians may be able to tailor future medical interventions to prevent PSP student Department: Obstetrics and Gynecology Honors Student Oral Presentation Prevent a tive Care Utilization Among Rural vs. Urban Young Adult Women 12 Months Prior to Pregnancy Reece Burns University Kansas School of Medicine -Wichita INTRODU CTION Pregnancy -related mortality in the United States occurs in 32.3 per 100,000 live births. In rural areas, maternal mortality rates are even higher, and patients are less likely than urban patients to receive routine care. The purpose of this study was to compare primary and prenatal care and health behaviors among perinatal mothers living in rural and urban Kansas. METHODS D ata were collected from 1 ,971 pregnant women who participated in the Phase 8 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) for Kansas between 2016 and 2018. Respondent location (categorized as urban or rural) was abstracted from birth certificates and frequencies of various healthcare visits and secondary healthcare variables were compared. RESULTS M ost respondents (75.1%, n = 1,481) resided in an urban area. Most (80.4%, n = 1,664) women were Caucasian, and 31.1% (n = 613) were 25 to 29 years. More urban women reported having insurance via an employer pre -pregnancy (p = 0.017) and during pregnancy (p = 0.015) than rural women. More urban women reported visiting an obstetrician/gynecologist within 12 months before pregnancy than rural women (p < 0.0001). Urban women more commonly reported attending pre -pregnancy dental visits (p = 0.019) and teeth cleanings (p = 0.004) than rural women. Of the 35.7% of respondents (n = 516) who reported receiving pre -pregnancy counseling on folic acid, prenatal vitamins, or multivitamins, most (78.9%, n = 407) resided in an urban area. DISCUSSI ON Rural women reported fewer routine primary and prenatal care behaviors compared to their urban counterparts. Efforts are needed to improve access to OB/GYN services, especially for women in rural areas.

Sepsis patients who experience subsequ ent cardiovascular events have increased mortality; however, data are limited among septic shock patients with cardiovascular events. This study reports in -hospital mortality, incident cardiovascular events, and cardiovascular procedures among sepsis patients with and without subsequent septic shock. METHODS P atients with a primary diagnosis of sepsis with and without a secondary diagnosis of septic shock were identified from the 2016 and 2017 Nationwide Readmissions Database. RESULTS A total of 2,126,093 patients were included in the study, with a mean age of 66 years. Twenty percent of patients (n = 430,135) developed subsequent septic shock. In -hospital mortality among patients with a primary diagnosis of sepsis was 5.2% and it was 30.7% for those with subsequent septic shock. The most common cardiovascular events among patients with a primary diagnosis of sepsis with and without subsequent septic shock, respectively, were: acute kidney injury (65.1% vs 32.7%, p <0.0001), vs. 0.9%, p <0.0001). Cardiovascular procedure frequencies also varied between sepsis patients with and without septic shock including percutaneous transluminal coronary a ngiography (0.38% vs. 0.04%, p <0.0001). DISCUSSI ON Sepsis with subsequent septic shock is associated with increased in -hospital mortality and an increased frequency of in -hospital cardiovascular events and procedures than sepsis alone. Grace Falk, MS-2 ( 913) 416- 0806 greilly@kumc.edu 37Category: Research Level: Medical student Department: Pediatrics Honors Student Oral Presentation Campers an d Camp Counselors with Type 1 Diabetes : A Cross -Sectional Study Stephanie School of Medicine -Wichita INTRODU CTION By 2050, more than 580,000 children in the United States will be diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Management of T1D requires careful and continuous intervention, and childr en with T1D experience greater challenges in disease management than their adult counterparts. Diabetes camps are designed to help those with T1D learn diabetes management skills while experiencing summer camp. Psychological aspects are not explicitly addressed in diabetes camps located in Kansas. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychological state of past campers and camp counselors from one diabetes camp in Kansas. METHODS C ampers and counselors who had T1D and attended diabetes camp from 2015 to 2019 in Kansas were recruited to complete a survey about diabetes -related stress, diabetes management self- efficacy, and symptoms of depression. A link to the online survey was distributed to previous campers and counselors by email and through Facebook. RESULTS A total of 24 camp counselors and 10 campers were surveyed, 100% of whom reported having T1D and attending camp at least once. One -third of respondents (n = 8) reported having severe diabetes- related stress, and 100% (n = 34) reported high levels of diabetes management self- efficacy. Most participants reported moderate levels of depression, and 9% (n = 3) reported a past suicide attempt. These results suggest a relatively high prevalence in signs of psychological distress from former campers and camp counselors with T1D. DISCUSSI ON This study suggests that campers and counselors with T1D have high levels of diabetes -related stress, high diabetes management self -efficacy, and many signs of depression. Stepha Student Oral Presentation Improv ing Stewardship of Clostridioides difficile Testing with EMR and Christi Regional Medical Center, 3Infectious Disease Consultants INTRODU CTION Modern laboratory techniques cannot differentiate between Clostridium difficile (C. difficile ) colonization and infection. Therefore, testing must be clinically indicated. To reduce hospital- onset of C. difficile infections (HO -CDI), Ascension Via Christi-Wichita (AVC -Wichita) intervened in three stages by introducing: 1) a C. difficile testing algorithm, 2) an electronic medical record (EMR) -based decision support system to enforce said algorithm, and 3) phone calls from the infection prevention department to providers to discontinue tests not collected within 24 hours of the order. The goal of this study was to determine if these interventions improved the HO- CDI rate. METHODS A t AVC -Wichita, the three study periods were compared: baseline with algorithm training only, the EMR intervention, and the EMR intervention with additional phone calls (EMR + phone calls). Data were abstracted from the hospital EMR. RESULTS A total of 311 charts were reviewed. Adherence to the algorithm increased from 34% at baseli ne to 52% after the EMR intervention (p = 0.010). During the EMR + phone calls time -period, more tests were discontinued (87%, n = 39) compared to baseline (54%, n = 15) and EMR (54%, n = 15, p = 0.003). The HO-CDI rate ranged from 8.5 cases per 10,000 pat ient-days at baseline, to 7.9 during EMR, to 4.0 during EMR + Phone calls (p = 0.007). DISCUSSI ON The EMR and EMR + phone call interventions were associated with a significant decrease in the HO -CDI rate and an increase in provider adherence to the algorithm. Joseph Jo slin, MS-2 Level: Medical student Department: Internal Medicine Honors Student Oral Presentation Impact o f Infectious Disease Consultation on S. aureus Bacteremia M ortality at Ascension Via Christi Christi Regional Medical Center, 3Infectious Disease Consultants INTRODU CTION The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of a hospital policy requiring infectious disease (ID) consultation with chart review during treatment initiation and follow -up from an antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) pharmacist -driven team on S. aureus Bacteremia (SAB) patient mortality and clinical outcomes. METHODS T his retrospective study included adult inpatients with SAB from August 1, 2016 to May 30, 2018 (pre - policy) and June 1, 2018 to February 29, 2020 (post -policy). The primary outcome was in -hospital mortality, and secondary outcomes were 30 -day readmission rate, acute kidney injury (AKI) at discharge, length of hospital stay, and adherence to evidence -based guidelines treatment. RESULTS T he final sample included 468 patients for analysis. The greatest impact on patient mortality was management by non -ID physicians, which had an 8.1 increased chance of mortality during the hospital stay comp ared to those managed by ID consultants (CI 95%, 3.701 - 17.569). Mortality was reduced from 11% (n = 25) pre -policy to 6% (n = 13) after policy implementation, 2 (1, n = 435) = 3.19, p = 0.07. Those whose antibiotics were managed by non -ID physicians were three times more likely to be readmitted at 30-days. Those with a history of immunocompromised state (64% vs 36%), history of cardiovascular disease (56% vs 44%), and whether their provid er adhered to guidelines (23% vs 7%) were more likely to be discharged with AKI. Policy implementation was associated with fewer SAB cases without an ID consult (11% vs 0%). DISCUSSI ON A policy of mandatory ID consultation with pharmacist -driven AMS revie w to ensure compliance can improve patient mortality, 30 -day readmission rates, and clinical Honors Student Oral Presentation Abdomi nal Vascular Injuries : Outcomes and Treatm ent Options at a Single Level 1 Trauma Center David Kurt , School of Medicine -Wichita , 2Via Christi Regional Medical Center INTRODU CTION Several retrospective studies have demonstrated the viability of nonoperative management of high grade abdominal vascular lesions. However, these studies vary regarding the highest grade of injury that may be managed nonoperatively. The aim of this study was to evaluate our trauma patient population with abdominal vascular injuries. METHODS A retrospective chart review was conducted on trauma patients 15 years or older with an abdominal vascular injury admitted between 2004 and 2020. Patient o utcomes, treatment options (medical, surgical, or endovascular) and complications were evaluated. RESULTS A mong the 43 included patients, 33 (76.7%) were male with a mean age of 39 \u00b1 16.9 years and Injury Severity Score (ISS) of 28 \u00b1 13.5. Most vascular injuries occurred in the abdominal aorta (25.6%) and iliac vessels (25.6%). Fifteen patients (34.8%) died before treatment, whereas 13 (30.2%) were treated with open surgery, 9 (20.9%) nonoperatively, and 6 (13.9%) with coil embolization. Open surgery patie nts experience four (9.3%) complications, one reintervention, and three (6.9%) mortalities after treatment initiation. DISCUSSI ON The current study suggests that appropriately selected cases of vascular traumatic injuries may be safely managed nonoperativ ely. This supports generalizability of similar studies to rural populations. A large, multicenter study is desirable to determine the most appropriate treatment for vascular traumatic injuries. David Kurt , MS-2 (620) Orthopaedics Poster ID: KUMCW20 Improving Quality of Education , M.D. , Clint Benge, M.D., Bradley Dart , M.D. University of Kansas School of Medicine -Wichita PROBLEM Previously a mainstay of fracture treatment, skeletal traction is now primarily used for temporary fracture stabilization prior to internal fixation. Though nursing management of patients in skeletal traction remains a critical skill to prevent adverse patient outcomes , we found no standardized protocol regarding care of these patients at our Level 1 trauma center. BASELINE Orthopaedic nurse participants were administered a pretest to assess their knowledge of and comfort with the following aspects of skeletal traction: pin care, manual traction, frame assembly, weight application and removal, skin evaluation, neurovascular checks, and reporting issues. DESIGN A skeletal traction management protocol was drafted and implemented as hospital policy. Twenty -nine registered nurses (RNs) from an orthopaedic unit attended a financially -compensated, 45 -minute, in - person, off -shift educational session. After completing the pretest assessment, the RNs were briefed on the new hospital policy and key points were demonstrated. After the session, the RNs were given an identical post -test to determine changes in their perceived knowledge of and comfort with traction care. RESULTS Statistically significant improvements in RN knowledge and comfort were seen in six of the seven topics. The greatest increase was seen with manual traction. No significant change was observed regarding neurovascular checks, but this subject had the highest pretest scores. CONCLUSION We successfully created and implemented a hospital protocol that significant ly improved the level of RN knowledge of and comfort with the management of patients requiring skeletal traction. Future studies could assess the effectiveness of annual education regarding the traction policy.

The aim of this project was to collect data concerning inappropriate paging from nursing and other providers and reduce inappropriate pages by 30% in order to expedite communication and subsequently improve patient care. BASELINE Experiences of general surg ery residents. DESIGN A survey was sent to general surgery residents at the University of Kansas -Wichita concerning location and frequency of wrong pages for inappropriate provider or service. The data was collected over a two month rotation. RESULTS 24 respondents of a sample of 31 residents answered the survey questions. Majority of residents were located at St. Francis hospital (62.5%). 91.6% of residents received an inappropriate page from nursing staff members over a two month span. The frequency of paging the wrong resident occurred 1 - 3 times (41.6%), 4 - 6 times (29%), 7 - 10 times (4.2%), >10 times (12.5%), or never (12.5%). The frequency of paging the wrong surgical service occurred 1 - 3 times (62.5%), 4 - 6 times (16.7%), 7 - 10 times (4.2%), >10 times (0%), or never (16.7%). CONCLUSION General surgery residents at the University of Kansas -Wichita receive inappropriate pages, majority receive these pages 1 - 3 times over a two month span. These pages occur with similar frequency to the wrong resident or service. Future direction for this study includes education of residents to place an order dictating the appropriate recipient, education of nursing staff on how to determine who to appropriately page, and operator education concerning appropriate services to page. Post -education data analysis could be compared to this data sample. Anthony Easterday , M.D. (308) 325- 4824 Grace Winter , M.D ., Kyle Vincent, M.D. University of Kansas School of Medicine -Wichita PROBLEM The purpose of this project was to improve the pre -operative compliance with Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) medications in ERAS appropriate patients with a single colorectal surgeon at a single site. ERAS protocols have been proven to shorten length of hospital stay and decrease complications. BASELINE Three months of data were queried prior to any intervention to measure the baseline compliance of ERAS medications including acetaminophen, gabapentin and Entereg. 6% did not receive Entereg while 22% di d not receive gabapentin in the pre -op setting. DESIGN Retrospective chart review pre and post intervention was used to gather data and to identify the number of patients that were eligible for ERAS protocol. We specifically looked at a single surgeon at a single site to quantify the number of patients that received pre op medications including Entereg, acetaminophen and gabapentin. Ileostomy closures were excluded from our study. Our intervention consisted of including above stated medications in the pre -op order set the surgeon's office sent to the hospital for patient's that met ERAS criteria. RESULTS Following the intervention, 4% of patients did not receive Entereg and 11% did not receive gabapentin. CONCLUSION Some anesthesia providers were hesitant to prescribe gabapentin based on patient co -morbidities and side effects of the medication. Following the intervention, gabapentin had increased administration. This is speculated to be because of surgeon request. Pre -op orders from the surgeon's office appear to be effective in improving ERAS compliance.

BASELINE Our initial demographics showed that we have 981 patients who are 15 years old or older. Resident clinic notably contains a small portion of these patients (15%). Of the patients 19 years old and older ( n = 189), the majority of patients are seen in t een clinic (72%). However, the faculty see 45% of the 792 patients aged 15 - 18 years old and the teen clinic only sees 38% of those patients. DESIGN We are tracking patients as they graduate out of the clinic and referred to KU I nternal Medicine clinic using a QR code. A new transition policy is posted in the exam rooms for patients and families. Finally, we implemented the STARx Questionnaire which is a self -administered validated tool for patients and parents created to measure transition readiness during their annual visit starting at age 15 ye ars old. Providers were notified of the changes through email, in -person communication, and handouts posted around the clinic. RESULTS Unfortunately, at this time, no patients have met criteria for completing the questionnaires. One patient has been trans ferred using the QR code at this time. CONCLUSION This project was designed to serve as the base for further projects moving forward. Further PDSA cycles will target further education of providers and patients regarding transition and improving the transition process between pediatric and adult providers. Aimee Nguyen , M.D. (360) 918- 1819 anguyen14@kumc.edu 45Category: Quality Improvement Level: Resident Department: Family & Community Medicine Poster ID: KUMCW47 Improving Medication Reconciliation in a Family Medicine Clinic 2University of Kansas School of Medicine -Wichita PROBLEM Medication reconciliation is a collaborative process within the healthcare system to validate the accuracy and comprehensibility of patients' medication information consistently across settings. This process reduces the potential for medication discrepancies and reduces adverse drug events. Knowing the importance of an accurate medication reconciliation with patients, this project aimed to increase the accuracy of the medication lists within the EMR. BASELINE Baseline measurement was a survey of all patients in a 30 -day period of time regarding their medication reconciliation. DESIGN Project ran from March to November 2020 and all patients over aged 18 received brief educational interventions regarding medicine reconciliation at each clinic appointment. Education for physicians and nursing staff regarding the importance of reminding patients to bring medication to appo intments was also provided. RESULTS Small improvements in the number of patients bringing their medications to clinic appointments were shown after the intervention (10% vs. 15%); however, after the end of the intervention period fewer patients indicated they were reminded to bring their medications to appointments (96% vs. 10%). CONCLUSION A multitude of factors contribute to a lack of complete medication reconciliation, which creates the potential for error. Clinic workflows have not traditionally included a regular inventory of all medications a patient takes or verifying these lists with the patient. When health care information is not integrated across settings it is not easy to validate or fill in the gaps from patient -reported information. It requires the entire healthcare team to ensure patients understand the importance of medicine reconciliation and are reminded at each visit. Kari Nilsen , Ph.D. (316) 293- 1894 knilsen@kumc.edu Department: Poster ID: KUMCW48 Depressi on Screening in A dolescents: A Statewide Quality Improvement ( QI) Collaborative Amanda Aguila Gonzalez , MPH , , M.D. , Kari Harris , M.D . University of Kansas School of Medicine -Wichita PROBLEM Depression screening for adolescents at preventive v isits is an evidence -based national recommendation. However, research shows adherence to screening recommendations is highly variable and inadequate. This project aimed to increase screening for depression in adolescent patients by primary care physicians and clinicians (PCPs) from baseline by at least 10% during the three months of the project. BASELINE The Patient Health Questionnaire- 9 Modified for Adolescents (PHQ -9M) tool was used to screen adolescents aged 12 - 21 years. An aggregated baseline screening rate of 80% was selected based on national data. DESIGN PCPs elected to participate in this QI project. Three seven -day QI improvement cycles assessed PCPs' compliance with screening adolescents during preventive visits. PCPs collaborated between cycles to share performance, interventions, and barriers. Individual site performance was aggregated. RESULTS Seven PCPs from five sites participated. Cycle 1 showed screening rates of 83%. By the end of Cycle 3 , 100% compliance in screening was achieved. Interventions included creating awareness of/access to the PHQ -9M, adaptations to the patient check -in process , and new delegations to support staff in screening. Barriers included lack of familiarity with tool, clinic processes, and pandemic effects on patient flow and workforce. CONCLUSION This project improved compliance with a national evidence -based guideline. PCPs validated commitment to implementing best practice recommendations for depression screening. Steps identified to sus tain changes included integration of PHQ -9M tool in electronic medical record and establishing clinic policies to screen patients every visit. Improved screening should create opportunities for early interventions to address the increased mental health nee ds of adolescents during and post pandemic. Amanda Aguila Gonzalez , MPH Initiation in a Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Bradley Newell of Kansas School of Pharmacy , 2Ascension Medical Group Via Christi INTRODUCTION Going beyond current diabetes guidelines, this case report describes the initiation of semaglutide in the complex management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in a patient post -liver transplantation (PLT). CASE DESCRIPTION A 63 -year- old Caucasian male with T2DM, on basal- bolus insulin therapy for management, was referred by his family medicine provider to the ambulatory care pharmacist for diabetes management due to a hemoglobin A1c level greater than 10%. Semaglutide was initiated and titrated to improve blood glucose control in combi nation with basal-bolus insulin adjustments taking disease states, cost, and health literacy into consideration. Over an eight -month period, the patient's A1c level improved to achieve a goal of less than 7% while remaining stable on tacrolimus therapy. Co mbined non -pharmacological interventions and the role of the pharmacist are critical as a 3% A1c reduction with adding semaglutide is not usually seen. DISCUSSION Without precise T2DM guidelines in PLT patients, clinical judgement must be utilized while i ncorporating patient specific social determinants of health. PLT patients with diabetes can minimize drug side -effects, reduce risk of organ rejection, and achieve A1c goal through engagement of the pharmacist in care to address the needs of the whole pati ent through immunosuppressant therapy monitoring and diabetes medication adjustments. While the addition of semaglutide assisted in glycemic control, influencing factors must be considered. Semaglutide, in addition to basal- bolus insulin therapy, allowed f or overall improved glycemic control, however further studies are needed to further evaluate efficacy due to the complexity of diabetes management in this patient population. Bradley Newell , Sciences Poster ID: KUMCW36 A Case of Pediatric of Kansas School of Medicine -Wichita INTRODUCTION Pediatric catatonia usually presents acutely but its onset can also be insidious. Duration can be brief or chronic for weeks or months. Catatonia in children and adolescents occur most commonly in the context of the schizophr enia spectrum followed by affective disorders. Trauma also plays an important role in the onset of catatonic presentations in youth. In the following case report, we discuss a case of pediatric catatonia in the context of a difficult to reach psychiatric d iagnosis. CASE DESCRIPTION The psychiatric child and adolescent team managed a 16 y/o African American female in state custody with a complicated and somewhat uncertain past psychiatric, psychosocial, medical, and family history following a suicide attempt via overdose. During hospitalization, she exhibited symptoms of negativism, mannerisms, posturing and waxy flexibility. She was responsive to high doses of lorazepam. Through extensive medication trials, she ultimately stabilized with the addition of clozapine and sertraline. Lorazepam was eventually tapered to a low dose without recurrence of symptoms. DISCUSSION Though literature indicates that antipsychotics worsen catatonic symptoms, this case seems to confirm that neuroleptics have a place in the tr eatment of catatonia. Due to the elevated morbidity and mortality in catatonia, effective recognition and treatment of the underlying cause is imperative. Christopher Dao, D.O. (310) 920- 2845 cdao@kumc.edu ID: KUMCW11 Gastric Metastas is of Breast Cancer Found on Routine Screening for Esophageal Varices Luke Johnson , M.D. , Ryan Ford , M.D. , Nathan Tofteland , M.D. University of Kansas School of Medicine -Wichita INTRODUCTION Screening with esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is recommended at initial diagnosis of cirrhosis and every one to three years depending on level of compensation and presence of varices. Incidence of metastatic cancer to the stomach is rare. Breast, lung, and renal cell cancer are the most prevalent. Symptoms include epigastric pain, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and dysphagia. CASE DESCRIPTION A 50 -year- old female with history of cirrhosis and invasive ductal carcinoma (T1c, N2, M0) status -post lumpectomy, radiation, and chemotherapy presented for routine screening of esophageal varices. EGD showed moderate portal hypertens ive gastropathy. Biopsies for evaluation of H. pylori demonstrated metastatic breast carcinoma. DISCUSSION Immunohistochemical staining helps differentiate primary gastric cancer from metastatic cancer. Incidence of metastatic cancer to the stomach is 0.2 - 0.7%, primary sites of which include: breast 27%, lung 23%, renal cell carcinoma 7.6%, and malignant melanoma 7%. Average time to metastatic disease is 50 - 78 months, with an average age of 75.6. Endoscopically, breast cancer metastasis is localized an d diffusely infiltrating. Microscopic findings show an Indian file pattern with signet ring appearance in the serosal, muscular, and submucosal layers. Our findings resembled portal hypertensive gastropathy and mucosal friability with biopsies showing large, with prominent nucleoli and foamy cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical staining suggesting a breast origin shows positive markers for ER, PR, CK7, GCDFP -15, and negative markers for CK20, CA19 -9, -2. Our immunohistochemistry was positive for ER, CK7, GCDFP -15, and CK20. It is important to obtain histologic sampling in patients with primary malignant lesions to detect the presence of metastatic disease. Luke Johnson , M.D. , M.D. , John Peterson , D.O. University of Kansas School of Medicine -Wichita INTRODUCTION Approximately one-fourth of admissions to stroke centers are diagnosed with non -stroke conditions or stroke mimics. Differentiating between these diagnoses and acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is an important and time -sensitive task. The decision whether or not to administer thrombolytic therapy is also a critical component, and its safety has been studied numerous times. CASE DESCRIPTION This case presents an immunocompromised patient presenting with symptoms of expressive aphasia, confusion, dysarthria, and decreased level of consciousness initially diagnosed as an AIS who was treated with thrombolytic therapy prior to further imaging indicating pneumococcal meningitis requiring delayed treatment with tympanomastoidectomy and myringotomy due to thrombolytic therapy. After surgery and treatment with antibiotics, the patient's neurologic status returned to baseline, and no neurological deficits were present on discharge. DISCUSSION Many stroke mimics such as migraines, infections, and seizures exist. Time is of the essence fo r treatment of an AIS. The safety profile of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has been studied numerous times in stroke mimics and shown to be relatively safe indicating if the patient has no contraindications for stroke intervention ; treatment of strok e should not be extensively delayed to rule out stroke confounders. Matea SMARCB 1/INI1 -Deficient Tumors of Adulthood : A Review Nathaniel rhabdoid tumors are aggressive tumors that are extremely rare in adults. Mutations in the tumor -suppressor gene SMARCB1/INI1 have become a defining characteristic of any neoplasm with a disposition for rhabdoid cytomorphology. Cases of SMARCB1/INI1 loss have been reported in various tumors with mesenchymal and epithelial origins. Thus, rhabdoid tumors are a mixed polyphenotypic group, which can make the diagnosis chal lenging. The majority of SMARCB1/INI 1-deficient malignancies with a rhabdoid cytomorphology, in any age and location, are typically aggressive, and prognosis is often poor. We report a rare case of such a tumor and review the literature for its molecular, clinical, and imaging features. CASE DESC RIPTION A 56 -year- old male presented with the chief complaints of unilateral lower abdominal and pelvic pain. He underwent urgent surgical intervention and mass resection with tissue sampling. After pathology confi rmed the diagnosis, systemic chemotherapy with vincristine and doxorubicin, plus ifosfamide and mesna was administered. Following treatment, he experienced a durable response to therapy for this aggressive and rare soft tissue sarcoma. To date, the patient remains in complete remission following the cessation of chemotherapy. DISCUSSI ON Malignant SMARCB1/IN I1-deficient extrarenal rhabdoid tumors are a variety of rare soft tissue sarcoma in adult patients with aggressive features. Tissue biopsy is the confirmatory test of choice. However, despite clinician due diligence and the presence of supportive histocytomorphologic evidence, the diagnosis remains challenging. Immunohistochemistry can help elucidate the inactivation of SMARCB1/INI1 and thereby support the diagnosis of malignant extrarenal rhabdoid tumors in adults. Early identification is imperative and helps guide therapy with chemotherapy regimens. Nathan iel Parker M.D. University of Kansas School of Medicine -Wichita INTRODUCTION This case presents a patient 30 months after diagnosis of Extra -nodal Natural Killer T Cell Lymphoma (ENKTL ) with a sustained complete response to Pembrolizumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor targeting the Programmed Death -1 receptor. CASE DESCRIPTION An 82 -year- old Asian male with past medical history of stage IIIB colon cancer and prostate cancer presented to his oncologist with bilateral, painful neck swallowing and weight loss. Past history of smoking > 10 years ago. Bilateral cervical swelling was present with no other physical exam abnormalities. Diagnosis was made using ultrasound -guided needle core biopsy. CT scan with contrast and PET/CT scan showed involvement of surrounding sinuses, lymph nodes, hilar , and pulmonary involvement. After failed treatment with first line chemotherapy and radiation, next generation sequ encing showed PD -L1 expression at 15% and Pembrolizumab was begun. This ultimately resulted in complete response 30 months after diagnosis. DISCUSSION ENKTL is a rare and aggressive hematologic malignancy found in the nasal cavity and surrounding locations in 80% of cases. It accounts for approximately 10% of non -Hodgkin's lymphoma and is most common in East Asian and Latin American decent. Prognosis depends on stage, location, age, tumor markers , and previous EBV infection. Aggressive forms of this cancer are dismal with a median overall survival of eight months. First -line therapy consists of chemotherapy or chemo -radiation therapies but both remain with high recurrence rate and toxicities. Treatment with targeted immunotherapy could offer potential therapeutic avenues for relapsed/refractory ENKTL. One such developing method uses next generation sequencing to determine expression of Programmed Death Ligand -1 in K. of Medicine -Wichita INTRODU CTION Pseudocholinesterase enzyme deficiency is a rare condition that presents with prolonged effects of depolarizing paralytic agents used in surgery. Understanding the differential diagnosis of neuromuscular causes of respiratory failure is critical for recognition and management of this benign disorder. CASE DESC RIPTION A 53 -year- old male presented to the ICU from the operating room due to delay of extubation after undergoing uncomplicated inguinal hernia repair. He received standard surgical paralytics including Succinylcholine and Rocuronium. At the end of the procedure, the patient failed to draw appropriate tidal volumes. He was tachypneic indicating intact central respiratory drive. Sugammadex, a reversal for Rocuronium, had no effect. Succinylcholine toxicity was suspected, and he was transferred to the ICU for further monitoring. Laboratory studies were unremarkable. Review of the chart revealed no previous surgeries under general anesthesia. Respiratory support and mild sedation was maintained for patient comfort. Three hours later the patient was successfully extubated after passing a spontaneous breathing trial. He recovered with no residual weakness or oxygen requirements. Afterward upon interview, he revealed his sister had a similar experience and was presumably diagnosed with pseudocholinesterase deficiency. The patient was advised to avoid succinylcholine in the future and has an excellent prognosis. DISCUSSI ON Immediate recognition of this benign condition can enhan ce measures for patient comfort while avoiding potentially harmful medications used for conditions presenting similarly. Preoperative genetic analysis is unfeasible, but careful interview including specific questions regarding familial experiences with ane sthesia may help anticipate this Poster ID: KUMCW45 Localized AL Cardiac Amyloidosis in a Patient Hassan Farhoud, MS-3, Paul of Kansas School of Medicine -Wichita INTRODU CTION Localized cardiac AL amyloidosis is rare in patients with Waldenstr\u00f6m Macroglobulinemia (WM). Its occurrence with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) can present a diagnostic challenge since HOCM progression may have a similar presentation. CASE DESC RIPTION An 84 -year-old female with a history of HOCM, diagnosed seven years prior, presented with worsening heart failure, despite medical therapy. EKG showed decreasing voltage and 2D echocardiogram showed a and no pericardial side transudative pleural effusion. DISCUSSI ON An a right ventricular endocardial biopsy was done. Pathology showed amyloid deposits, confirmed by Congo stain and typed as kappa AL amyloid. Serum IgM lambda, kappa/lambda ratio, NTproBNP , and troponin I confirmed the diagnosis of AL amyloidosis. She was referred to a multidisciplinary amyloid program. She had no signs of other system involvement. Bone marrow biopsy showed 80 % IgM clonal plasma cells, and she was started on palliative CyBorD regimen and rituximab. Pleural effusions became chylous after a few months, likely due to WM and needed thoracentesis every one to two weeks. An indwelling pleural catheter is contraindicated. This case highlights unusual presentations of uncommon cardiomyopathies, the role of a multimodality diagnostic process , and a multidisciplinary team approach in the management of AL cardiac amyloidosis.
