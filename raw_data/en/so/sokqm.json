With [80 percent of eligible adults having received at least one dose](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/579479-white-house-70-of-adults-are-fully-vaccinated-80-partially), a new trend has risen among those who believe the vaccine is dangerous: Attempting to \"undo\" their vaccine after getting it. [Carrie Madej, D.O.](https://www.instagram.com/fenixmeddr/?hl=en), an osteopathic doctor with over 43,000 Instagram followers, was [seen on video](https://twitter.com/oneunderscore__/status/1459216778748383238) encouraging her followers to take a bath with baking soda for \"radiation,\" epsom salt for \"poisons,\" and Borax, a household cleaning and laundry brightener tossed in. \"Detox detox detox baths,\" Dr. Madej says they \"take care of\" pesticides, \"heavy metals,\" and even parasites. Madej suggests that bathing in baking soda and epsom salt is a \"radiation detox\" that gets \"fungus and yeast\" out of your body. She also mentions adding bentonite clay, like the one found in skincare masks, and scrubbing yourself with borax can remove \"nanotechnology\" from your body, using water \"as hot as you can tolerate.\" Borax misuse comes with a variety risks including: skin, eye, and respiratory irritation, digestive problems, infertility, kidney failure, shock, and even death, according to the [National Library of Medicine](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Borax#section=Safety-and-Hazards). The FDA has also banned borax as a food additive. A quick [Facebook search for \"borax\"](https://www.facebook.com/search/top?q=borax) shows people are using borax as a \"healing agent\" and [several](https://m.tiktok.com/v/7020047931877199106.html?_d=secCgwIARCbDRjEFSACKAESPgo8ND0cMhBYBQHPdX21uIVUxYATMP9kswOTiObRlBncqdpl8lIvvgTGBRlZDsdR7GUZODXXPfzGxNzQCKhKGgA%3D&checksum=a76b1c6a3490e6b576de92ae7130f4ec1161b54abbee049fcf8bccb138ac2d7b&language=en&preview_pb=0&sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAU3YioYWDkzYI-JVkWNLi2KsLP4eaBVtF348RjzcvSiJsQvBefKwLVQg2vx2CLzkA&share_app_id=1233&share_item_id=7020047931877199106&share_link_id=14BDA60F-EB98-4BDB-9DE0-28B64F06EE88&source=h5_m\u00d7tamp=1636744288&tt_from=copy&u_code=cmje992ig1lle0&user_id=6549258362050057216&utm_campaign=client_share&utm_medium=ios&utm_source=copy) [TikTokers](https://m.tiktok.com/v/7021225446284987653.html?_d=secCgwIARCbDRjEFSACKAESPgo8b6CwK2NxBPgMRaVv4hPI0mNLxRuuecXczyOGeDm5XhMF24QhLPzZq1UBdY6lWcnrg23L7f7A3SL7o5X3GgA%3D&checksum=c2b00e2b147949b80151b8483a2dbb176c5b18cfa7df3d767ac345ff80041be7&language=en&preview_pb=0&sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAU3YioYWDkzYI-JVkWNLi2KsLP4eaBVtF348RjzcvSiJsQvBefKwLVQg2vx2CLzkA&share_app_id=1233&share_item_id=7021225446284987653&share_link_id=FAA5CA2D-2C2A-4D5A-BC63-B4FAF3DC3B5D&source=h5_m\u00d7tamp=1636744321&tt_from=copy&u_code=cmje992ig1lle0&user_id=6549258362050057216&utm_campaign=client_share&utm_medium=ios&utm_source=copy) are promoting the purported anti-vaccine benefits of the bath. Just the tag ['detox bath'](https://www.tiktok.com/discover/detox-bath?lang=en) alone has over 1.5 billion collective video views on the platform alone. \"The risks [of the bath] are minimal,\" [William Schaffner, M.D.](https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md), professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center tells Men's Health. \"You may get an external skin cleansing, but it won't have any effect on your immune system, which has already responded to the vaccine.\" It's also impossible to \"undo\" a vaccine after receiving it, adds Dr. Schaffner, since the vaccine stimulates the immune system to respond to Covid solely internally. \"External bathing or treatment will not enter the body.\" The only way for the body to stop responding to the vaccine is if A) you get a serious disease that [weakens your immune system](https://www.menshealth.com/health/a34588112/keep-immune-system-healthy-strong/) or B) an immunosuppressant drug, adds Dr. Schaffner. \"And even then, your immune system will likely retain some memory of the vaccination.\" In short, once you get the vaccine, what's done can't be undone. Save the borax for your laundry, not your Sunday evening soak. [Taylyn Washington-Harmon](http://taylyn.co/) is a writer and editor based in Chicago.
