How do we test this? What indicators do we use? Signs of an \"unbalanced\" immune system Fatigue/weakness Repeat illness and infections Slow wound healing Allergies Autoimmune diseases Candida overgrowth Consequences of a chronically imbalanced immune system Cancer Crohn's Disease Fibromyalgia Lupus Multiple Sclerosis Raynard's Syndrome Rheumatoid Arthritis Heart Disease Osteoporosis & Arthritis Good immune function Immunity begins before birth, and continues to develop throughout our lives endlessly. Maternal transfer (placenta/breast milk/herd immunity) An evolving process influenced by life experience (>90%) and to a much lesser degree, genetics (<10%). Factors including diet/emotion/nutrition/nervous system communication/ and toxins FAR OUTWEIGH genetics The I.S. normally develops memory, defense strategies, and resistance through experience of encountering typical infection causing microorganisms/stressors/environment Without experience, research suggests an increase likelihood for other conditions like asthma, poor resistance to colds 3Good immune function Some say the immune system is like an internal cleanup system for whole the body What needs cleaning up? - Viruses/bacteria/foreign substances that do not belong - Things not recognized as normal parts of your body- Changes to normal cells and tissues in the body from disease processes (examples: heart disease, cancers, cells that are decayed or dying (joints), and mutations) Immune function How foreign things (viruses/bacteria) get in our body? Most bacteria or viruses actually live among us, around our EENT, within the digestive tract, respiratory system, on our skin. Most of the time they are harmless \"symbiotes\" living in us in balanceWhen life balance is lost these organisms take advantage of this and we become sick. How is the balance lost? 90 % of this is lifestyle, stresses, poor choices, and environment. Other foreign chemicals or molecules/toxins enter us and tissue changes form inside of us in a many ways: Leaky guts, sick intestinal walls and poor barriers to chemicals, proteins, bacteria. Drugs, inhalants, self care products, diseases. Body adaptation and health A sign of good health is our ability to adapt to various things in our lives. Adaptation constitutes normal behavior. If circumstances drive ongoing adaptations, we can suffer! To understand how the human body adapt, here are some examples we can relate to: Low Normal Range High Heart rate: Blood pressure: Cholesterol: Thyroid Hormones: 4Poor immune function = Imbalanced immune function Like all body systems, the immune system behaves in a high or low level if we are not 100% well, or we live in a state of adaptation (stressors present) Problems arise with constant and chronic adaptation Can you think of examples of immune function that is too high? Too low? 1. Auto-immune disorders and over aggressive immune function 2. Immunosuppression type conditions (nutritional insufficiency) 3. General internal ill health related conditions 4. Allergies and hypersensitivities Another key in understanding the I.S. The immune system is inseparable from the nervous system! and the nervous system adapts to everything in our lives! Perceived mental, physical , chemical(nutritional) stressors are the majority (90%) of cause leading to a weakened immune system! Physical, chemical, emotional, or mental/spiritual stressors! \"Environmental\" Immunity and nerves The relationship between the nervous system and the immune system was first reported by Researchers in 1993 in the journal Nature with The New York Times reported on it the day it was published: \"Scientists have found the first evidence of an anatomical connection between the nervous system and the immune system. Nerve cell endings in the skin and white blood cells of the immune system are in intimate contact , and chemicals secreted by the nerves can shut down immune system cells nearby.\" J. Hosoi G. F.

May 13, 1993 5Things need to balance in the nervous and immune systems Sympathetic-Parasympathetic system activity Th1cells - parasympathetic Th2cells - sympathetic Ideally you have balance between Th1cells:Th2cells Dr. Stephen Marini (Immunologist) - Examples of High Th2 (Chronic URT, ENT, GI, Hypergy)- Examples of High Th1(Rheumatic and osteoarthritis, Diabetes, Osteoporosis, etc.) Immune System Arms: Th1-cells : Th2-cellsTh1-CTh2-C The gut-immune connection There is a large percentage of the immune system in the gut called GALT (gut associated lymphoid tissue) and Peyer's Patches Because the gut is exposed to the external environment regularly, it makes sense that much of our immune system is concentrated in this area Immune cells are found in bone marrow, thymus, lymph nodes, spleen, tonsils, appendix and Peyer's patches (in the gut) They circulate in the body through blood to areas in need and fight off unwanted bacteria and other foreign material 6Role of the adrenal glands Responsible for: - Cortisol production (the STRESS hormone) - Aldosterone production Maintains salt and water balance in the body by simulating the KI to reabsorb salt - Glucocorticoids - glucose regulation - DHEA - mother of all hormones- Norepinephrine and Epinephrine Adrenaline - fight or flight So how does this affect my cold? Cortisol is the most powerful anti-inflammatory - peak during day 8am - Why we feel awful at night with a cold and good in morning (usually) - Cortisol neutralizes inflammatory effects of a cold in a.m. When we have adrenal fatigue the effects of a cold can feel much worse because we are not producing sufficient amounts of cortisol - Greatest contributor to adrenal fatigue...STRESS!!! How to support your adrenals Stick to a daily routine Eat a whole foods diet (identify any sensitivities) Get adequate rest Stress management Supplements: will review later in this workshop 7Implications of chronic stress When our bodies are under frequent stress the most common result is a cold or flu that keeps returning or lasts longer than usual Consistent activation of our fight or flight response (chronic stress) diminishes the capabilities of the immune system The immune system is downgraded in order to be able to continue functioning in this way Chronic stress raises cortisol levels (stress hormone) which among other things contributes to an under functioning immune system Results from a meta-analysis showed that stress causes decreased production of important immune cells Whereas acute stress actually causes an increase in immune cell productionImplications of chronic stress The stress response!

This triggers both sides of the immune system response TH1 and TH2 arms 9How does the vaccine work? Vaccine with Antigens Vaccines produce: Short term artificially elevate Th2-cell activity No decrease of infection incidence seen in reviews Immune system and vaccinations Natural immune development process - By design - natural - Results in a genuine immunization process - Life long benefits - Enhances adaptation - Dependent on self care wrt hygiene, nutrition, and proactive lifestyle Vaccination process - Not natural at all - Life long side effects- Independent of self care and promotes reactionary lifestyle - Only response from vaccines are C-Med response and small antibody response - Reduces adaptation Immune system in light of vaccinations Natural immunity 1.

The flu: sorting fact from fiction A review of the flu vaccine literature, immunology, and the immune system Matthew McCoy DC, MPH Editor - Journal of Pediatric, Maternal & Family Health - Chiropractic \"If you question the wisdom of this annual rite of passage you are not alone in your disdain for the flu shot. You'll be relieved to know that scien ce is on your side and that respected researche rs also question it.\" 11Doctors don't want them According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a significant number of health care professionals declined to get a flu shot during the 2006-07 flu season, with only about 40 percent opting for the shot. Docs talk the talk but do they take flu shots? http://abcnews.go.com/Health/ColdandFluNews/Story?id=6418974 &page=2 Ontario Canada study To determine if the incidence of influenza decreased following the introduction of their Universal Influenza Immunization Campaign (UIIC) in 2000. Researchers found that there has not been a decrease in the mean monthly influenza rate following the campaign. The scientists .... concluded in their research paper: \"Despite increased vaccine distribution and financial resources towards promotion, the incidence of influenza in Ontario has not decreased following the introduction of the UIIC.\" Groll DL, Thomson DJ. Incide nce of influenza in Ontario following the Universal Influenza Immunization Camp aign. Vaccine 24 (2006) 5245-5250 Archives of Internal Medicine Published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, researchers looked at the role of the flu vaccine in relation to benefit. \"Rates of mortality among people aged 65 to 74 years in the decade after the 1968 pandemic. The scientists ... could not correlate increasing vaccination coverage after 1980 with dec lining mortality rates in any age group . Concluded that because fewer th an 10% of all winter deaths were attributable to influenza in any season, that observational studies substantially overestimate vaccination benefit \" Simonsen,L,.

Impact of Influenza Vaccination on Seasonal Mortality in the US Elderly Population ARCH INTERN MED/VOL 165, FEB 14, 2005 122006 BMJ Study Another study published in th e British Medical Journal. It was funded by the Cochrane Collaboration, a revered independent non-profit foundation from Italy. \" this study challenged the safety and efficacy of the current flu vaccine recommended policy. Each year enormous effort goes into producing influenza vaccines for that specific year and delivering them to appropriate sections of the population. Is this effort justified ?\" The scientist's summary questioned the use of the flu vaccine as follows: Public policy worldwide recommends the us e of inactivated influenza vaccines to prevent seasonal outbreaks Because viral circulation and antigenic match vary each year and non-randomized studies predominate, systematic reviews of large datasets from several decades provide the best information on vaccine performance Evidence from systematic reviews show that inactivated vaccines have little or no effect on the effects measured Little comparative evidence exists on the safety of these vaccines Reasons for the current gap between policy and evidence are unclear, but given the huge resources involved, a re-evaluation should be urgently undertaken Jefferson T Influenza vaccination: policy versus evidence. BMJ Vol 333 28 OCTOBER 2006. The Lancet In another study published in The Lancet the researchers questioned the benefits of flu shots elderly people stating that the benefits are \"greatly exaggerated.\" The researchers stated that the public policy for the elderly getting flu shots is based on flimsy, even nonexistent, evidence. The researchers showed that unvaccinated seniors died at a higher rate for reasons unrelated to the flu. The scientists also reported that increasing vaccination rates since 1980 have not lowered death rates among the elderly . \"We find it peculiar that the claims that in fluenza vaccination can prevent half, or more, of all winter deaths in elderly people have not been more vigorously debated.\" Dr. Jackson also called for more realistic studies into other methods to help with the flu!

Chiropractic care Natural care focusing on the healthy function of the nervous system. Chiropractic adjustments (of any style) remove interference to the communications between vital organ systems and the brain. Interference to the nervous system is like radio reception during an electrical storm. Chiropractic Care According to Dr. Christopher Kent, a leading chiropractic researcher: \"Contemporary research is beginning to shed light on the neurobiological mechanisms which may explain the outstanding clinical results chiropractors have experienced when managing patients with viral and infectious diseases.\" 15Nerve system interference Stress causes increased brain activity , similar to chemical electricity or interference in the NS All the control centers of the Central Nervous System are over-stimulated. Respiratory Ctr Pituitary GlandOrgan Systems Muscular systems ACTH Hormone Neuroimmunobiology A comprehensive review of the research literature reveals the current understanding that the brain and immune system are the two major adaptive systems in the body . During an immune response, the brain and the immune system 'talk to each other' and this process is essential for maintaining homeostasis or balance in the body . Elenkov IJ, Wilder RL, Chrousos GP, Vizi ES. The sympathetic nerve, an integrative interface between two supersystems: the brain and the immune system. Pharmacol Rev. 2000 Dec;52(4):595-638. Chiropractic care Since its inception, chiropractic has asserted that viruses and microbes don't threaten us all equally and that a healthy immune system easily repels most invaders. ( why some people don't get sick ) The immune system protects us from the flu, as well as any other infectious disease, and strives to get us well again when we do fall ill. Our immune system, like every other system in the body, is coordinated and controlled by the nervous system. 16Chiropractic care Chiropractic has been shown to normalize increased electrical brain activity (EEG Studies), and has a calming effect on over- stimulation triggered by stress ! Better adapting ability to stress and less harmful stress responses! Chiropractic & immunity University of California, Irvine College of Medicine: -22-48% increase in WBC (Burst Cell) activity Study of 400 families contrasting conventional medical and chiropractic lifestyles in school-aged children: -50% less absenteeism rate in school d/t colds -69% otitis media free (Chiro), 20% OM free (medical) Chiropractic lifestyle A large study conducted by Robert Blanks Ph.D and his colleagues from the University of California studied nearly 3000 individuals undergoing chiropractic care. These individuals reported an average overall improvement, ranging from 7-28% , in a battery of physical symptoms including stiffness/lack of flex ibility in th e spine, physical pain, fatigue, incidence of colds and flu , headaches, menstrual discomfort, gastrointestinal disorders, allergies, dizziness and falls. Blanks et al., 1997, Journal of Vertebral Subluxation Research 17Chiropractic & Flu Chiropractors helping patients battle the flu is not a new occurrence. During the 1917-18 influenza epidemic, it has been estimated that 20 million people died throughout the world, including about 500,000 North Americans. Chiropractic's success in caring for flu victims led to the profession's licensure in many states, and eventually in Canada as well. Flu history Researchers reported that in Davenport, Iowa, out of the 93,590 patients treated by medical doctors, there were 6,116 deaths -- a loss of one patient out of every 15 . Chiropractors at the Palmer School of Chiropractic adjusted 1,635 cases, with only one death . Outside Davenport, chiropractors in Iowa cared for 4,735 cases with only six deaths -- one out of 866.

Burton Shields Press. Indianapolis, IN. 1925. Chiropractic & flu patients During the same epidemic, in Oklahoma, out of 3,490 flu patients under chiropractic care, there were only seven deaths. Furthermore, in 233 cases where medical treatment failed and these people were considered lost causes, they went on to try chiropractic and all but 25 were reportedly saved. 1.

Chiropractic & immunity These results are not so surprising given what we now know about the interaction between the nervous system and the immune system. Through research we know that chiropractic has beneficial effects on immunoglobulins, B-lymphocytes (white blood cells), pulmonary function and other immune system processes. Chiropractic & immunity One series of studies, by Patricia Brennan Ph.D and her team, found that when a chiropractic adjustment was applied to the middle back, the response of white blood cells was significantly higher after the chiropractic procedure. blood collected 15 minutes before and collected 15 minutes, 30 and 45 minutes after the manipulation Brennan's research demonstrated an \"enhanced respiratory burst\" following the chiropractic adjustment. This \"burst\" is needed for our immune cells to destroy invading viruses and bacteria Brennan et al: Enhanced neutrophil respiratory burst as a biological marker for manipulation forces.

Over the six-month period of the study, the group that did not receive chiropractic care experienced a 7.96% decrease in CD4 cell counts. The group that received chiropractic adjustments experienced a 48% increase in CD4 cell counts over the same period.

Chiropractic action plan Chiropractic check-ups for all family members (keep your home as healthy as possible) Discuss a regular wellness program for the family which is able to keep the nervous system functioning free of interference, and prevent many infections and illnesses throughout your life If you are sick, your chiropractor will often recommend coming in immediately to boost your immune response, and give yourself an advantage! Acupuncture & Immunity Acupuncture can be utilized to improve your immunity to colds and flu, as well as other potential illnesses. It has a regulatory effect on the body's natural immune response and can both enhance its action when needed or decrease the response when it is over-active due to stressors placed upon it that can result in allergies, sensitivities, and auto-immune disorders. 20Acupuncture & Immunity Studies have found that acupuncture: Enhances platelet count and prevents leukocyte decrease after radiation therapy or chemotherapy Enhances leukocyte phagocytosis Increases interleukin 2 and natural killer T cell activity Xia YQ, Zhang D, Yang CX, et al.: An approach to the effect on tumors of acupuncture in combination with radiotherapy or chemot herapy.

Acupuncture & Immunity Acupuncture is also well known for its effect on relieving the effects of stress, therefore helping to decrease the number one cause of adrenal fatigue and poor immune function that can make you sick! Applied Kinesiology and NAET Applied kinesiology (AKA muscle testing) can be utilized to determine potential allergies or sensitivities that may be creating extra stress on your immune system in 2 ways: Constant low-grade immune response Poor nutrient absorption 21Applied Kinesiology and NAET NAET (Nambudripad's Allergy Elimination Techniques) is another treatment option to systematically decrease the energy blockages caused by allergies or sensitivities that place extra stress on the body. Lightening the load on your immune system can decrease your symptoms and the potential for further reactions. Acupuncture action plan Regular acupuncture treatments in combination with other healthy lifestyle choices can keep your body functioning optimally and strengthen your innate resistance to illness. If you are already sick, acupuncture can help give your system a boost to decrease the duration of symptoms and get you back on our feet quicker! Massage & Immunity Massage therapy can also help to reduce stress and improve immune function by enhancing the circulation of blood and lymph. Abdominal massage can also improve digestive motility and promote proper elimination. 22Nutritional game plan (overview) Whole foods consistent with an innate diet Primarily fiber rich fresh fruits and veggies - Full color spectrum and keep them raw!
