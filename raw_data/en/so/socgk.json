She is especially passionate about integrative healthcare, particularly between Eastern and Western medicine through the use of nutrition, herbal medicine, acupuncture, and pharmaceuticals, when needed. She believes in the body's powerful innate intelligence to heal itself and believes there is a place and importance for both sides of medicine to work together when the body needs further support. Upon graduation she looks forward to adopting a practice where both fields can be integrated to provide accessibility and holistic practice to all age groups.

In her undergraduate education at Brigham Young University, she studied for and became a Certified Therapeutic Recreation Specialist (CTRS) and Certified Child Life Specialist (CCLS) with the intention of helping others with their psychosocial wellbeing. Moving to Portland and studying Chinese Medicine at NUNM turned a hobby into a way to more completely fulfill her mandate from heaven, her life mission.
