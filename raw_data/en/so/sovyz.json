There are many resources that nurses can use in order to provide this care. A few examples of these resources are medications, spirituality, and complementary therapies. A complementary therapy is a therapeutic technique that is often paired with an ongoing treatment. There are many different types of complementary therapies that can be used to help relieve pain, stress, and anxiety. Some therapies include music, pleasant smells, and even herbs. Sometimes complementary therapies are overlooked because nurses are not properly educated on how to either perform these therapies or do not know how these therapies can benefit a client.

Although this was the main reason why I chose this topic, my fascination with the past helped make the decision easier. I love learning how things have developed over time, and complementary therapies have been around for hundreds of years. My purpose within this paper is to inform nurses about the benefits of complementary therapies in order to help them embrace This is why I wouldn't like to focus on not only the Our bodies respond to different thoughts and emotions.

Conversely, there were studies that supported the efficacy of peppermint for reducing post-operative nausea. One randomized control trial ascertained that a blend of ginger, mints, and cardamom were effective in reducing nausea. Mint was found to reduce colonic spasms and slow peristalsis.

Those who inhaled the vapor of the oil had lower ACTH levels-the higher the levels, the more stressed the animals were. \"The Kavala Centre- International Yoga School says that lavender can be used to ease tension, tiredness and feelings of depression,\" states Dr. David Schlundt on his website \"Aromatherapy and Stress Reduction\" for Vanderbilt College (1).

This form of therapy is seen as a natural technique to heal a person's mind, body, and soul (Ali et al., 2015). There have been many ancient civilizations that have used this type of complementary and alternative medicine. These civilizations such as Egypt, China, and India have been using oils for over 6,000 years to treat an array of different ailments (Ali et al., 2015). Along with ancient civilizations, there have been over 200 references of the use of oils in the Bible (Perry, N., & Perry, E., 2006).
