Principles of integrative medicine are beginning to be interwoven into existing courses and electives and numerous integrative medicine-focused courses have been created in the UC medical sciences program. Learn more about our undergraduate student programs. Learn more about our graduate student programs. Learn more about our yoga studies certificate and yoga teacher training. The Mind-Body Medicine Elective provides students with self-care and reflection skills combined with group support to adaptively deal with stressors, leading to overall improved well-being and empathy, and ultimately healthier, balanced professionals. This course will focus on the evidence base and indication for use of mindbody techniques in both a personal and professional/clinical setting. The Planetary Health and Medicine course will be a 4-week part-time elective. The first 3 weeks will be completed online, and students will be tasked with a reading list, prerecorded lectures, and other online curricula to understand the impacts of the climate crisis through various lenses. They will be looking at climate change and how it impacts policy, health equity, and social justice and engage in discussion on these topics. At the end of this course, students will have a better understanding of the impacts of climate crisis on the individual health of their patients, the populations they care for, and the community in which they live. The last week will be devoted to the development and submission of a proposal on climate crisis/sustainability, focused on improvement of practices within our hospital system, medical school, and the surrounding community. Students will address a topic from among the following categories: medical waste, food sustainability, clean air, clean water, or energy utilization. They will have the opportunity to engage community leaders, advocates, educators, and policymakers on how to implement solutions outlined in their submission. This climate and health proposal will contribute towards future policies and one that can be acted upon to improve the health and wellbeing of the patients at UC Health or the larger Cincinnati community. The course will be offered in October and November, and then again in March and April with a maximum of 6 students in each block.

MEDS 2088 MEDS 2089 Kelly Lyle, MHA, MS, 200hr CYT 100% Online Asynchronous 3 Credit Hours Students will learn foundational concepts and how to use this knowledge to facilitate a strong Yoga Asana, Pranayama, and meditation practice as well as how to apply these principles in everyday life. MEDS 2092 - Introduction to Nature Based Therapies and Ecopsychology - 3 credit hours - (Dr. Barbara Walker) This course will be taught 100% Asynchronous online and will have four field trips throughout the semester TBD. This course will introduce scientifically-validated strategies around the basic theories and approaches of Nature-Based Therapeutics including restorative environments, therapeutic horticulture, animal-assisted interactions, therapeutic landscapes, forest bathing, green care farming, facilitated green exercise, wilderness therapy and ecopsychology. Three optional in-person experiential field trips. Dates TBD. The most recent National College Health Assessment (2022) (n=54,204) revealed that only 17.9% of undergraduate respondents reported eating an average of three or more servings of fruit (per day) over seven days. Additionally, 27.8% of the same population reported consuming an average of three or more servings of vegetables (per day) in the same timeframe. Their survey also indicated that 44.7% of responses indicated some level of food insecurity (based on the US Household Food Security Survey Module). Historically, most nutrition literature on academic performance focuses on children and adolescents in primary and secondary education. However, food is a foundational element of physiological needs necessary to thrive, and with multiple chronic diseases linked to dietary patterns and nutrition, increasing opportunities for expanded food literacy among higher education students may improve an individual's short and long-term health and well-being. Description: This course will explore concepts relevant to food literacy, culinary medicine, and seek to enhance students' fundamental culinary and nutritional knowledge for personal health. Throughout the course, we will examine dietary behavior on personal and global health outcomes and provide practical strategies for diet-related behaviors throughout one's life. To gain a holistic perspective on food literacy, we will also examine facets of food systems and their impact on environments, communities, and public health. Learning Objectives: Tai Chi Basics: Medication Through Movement - MEDS 2094 Rationale: Movement therapies such as Tai Chi and Qigong are one of the Eight Pillars of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) used to treat and maintain the body, mind, and spirit. These movement therapies are essential for health in TCM just like acupuncture, herbal medicine, and nutrition. Tai Chi was developed relatively recently (around the 17th century) to blend and balance the opposites of Yin and Yang yet it is rooted in philosophy and prescribed movements thousands of years old. It has developed and spread across the world as an artform and expression of health and spirituality. Studies have demonstrated the benefits of Tai Chi for common conditions including Parkinson's Disease1, hypertension2, and mental health3. Tai Chi has been shown to be a significant piece of improving and maintaining good health in conjunction with other forms of modern medicine. Description: This course will primarily focus on the Yang 24 Short Form which is the most commonly practiced Tai Chi set in the world. Students will be able to complete the form on their own by the end of the semester and integrate it into their self-care routines. The course will include weekly in-person instruction as well as self-practice. It will also involve weekly readings and lectures to introduce the philosophical and therapeutic concepts to round out the student's introduction to the foundations of Tai Chi movement and self-cultivation. Learning Objectives: Students who successfully complete this course will: MEDS 3070 MEDS 4038 Digestive disorders are a primary reason many Americans seek health care. There is ample evidence that stress, the environment, and diet play leading roles in many of these conditions. Join us to explore the toll that the Western diet and lifestyles have on gut health and health in general, the role of Social Determinants of Health and nutrition-driven biology, and the broad influence the gut has on other biologic systems. Share the role of developing content to educate your classmates via weekly patient-focused case-based learning, along with enjoying the in-class application of Integrative models for more effective prevention and treatment of digestive diseases. This interactive course helps students learn how to apply these principles in a clinical setting to better educate their patients and ultimately improve patient outcomes.
