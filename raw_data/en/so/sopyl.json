It is our mission to help improve the quality of life of our patients with non-surgical, non-opioid pain management. We make it possible for patients to regain control of their life without costly surgeries or addictive medications. As an integrative medical clinic, we embrace a new medical model that treats the dysfunction-causing symptoms and pain, instead of the traditional health care protocol of simply prescribing drugs to mask symptoms without actually addressing the cause of the ailment. Our clinic offers various ways to treat acute and chronic joint and muscle pain such as: Have you been on pain medication that simply does not provide relief? Steroid injections? Surgery? Do you feel like you've tried everything, only to be let down time and time again? When was the last time you were able to sit down with your provider for more than 15 minutes to discuss your symptoms? Call now to see how we can help you at [(850) 226-6728](tel:(850) 226-6728). We are not accepting Medicaid or Oscar at this time. The staff and Dr. Persiani are excellent and very accompanied and understanding. They are always helpful and friendly and will explain every single step or procedure to you as a patient as you go! I came here because I had lower back pain and horrible neck pain. Dr.Persiani and his staff took me in and immediately made me and continue to make me feel better with every appointment. The attitude they have is professional but not to the point that you can't conversate with them at all. They all know exactly what they are doing and how to do it well. I was never one for appointments but they all actually make me look forward to my appointments. I highly recommend them and will come back should my back pain ever come back. Great Clinic!! Helpful and kind staff. Doctor Eric works wonders, I am beyond thankful to have been referred to him!! Affordable, professional and consistent, thank you for everything Great place and great people. Fine fine people. Getting me straighten out. "}
