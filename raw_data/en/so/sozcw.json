Anthroposophic Medicine was founded in 1920 by Dr Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) and Dr Ita Wegman (1876-1943). Today Anthroposophic Medicine is practiced in over 80 countries, in therapeutic centers, private clinics and Anthroposophic hospitals -throughout the world. It encompasses new ways of observing and researching nature, medicinal plants, human anatomy and physiology, and the cosmic forces acting on the above. This training involves exploring spiritual meditative practices that support the ethical & spiritual development of the physician. Trainees will have personal experiences of Art therapy, Eurythmy therapy, Rhythmical massage, and other body therapies based on the new understanding of the human being, both in health and illness. These non medical treatments, can intensify therapeutic responses to illness. Biographical aspects and insights from psychotherapy and counseling are also considered in understanding the development of disease processes. As doctors and therapists we work intimately with the lives of individuals and that requires wisdom, for the good of all. Anthroposophy literally means wisdom of human beings. Therefore it is necessary that we engage in processes of contemplation, meditation and a wish to evolve in one's own inner path. Further we need to become acquainted with important skills and concepts regarding our own time and self-management in order to prevent ourselves and our staff from burn-out syndrome.
