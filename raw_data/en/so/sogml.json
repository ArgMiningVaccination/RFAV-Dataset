While it's true that some supplements can be helpful in some circumstances, people regularly overestimate the benefits and safety. Many use dietary supplements without understanding the supplement industry or talking to a dietitian, and they instead rely on advertisements and labeling. However, people can't trust what many supplements claim to contain or deliver because of ineffective regulation of the supplement industry. It's easy to assume that if a product is on a store shelf, then it must be safe. However, dietary supplements are regulated in a post-market manner, meaning the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not evaluate the contents or effects of supplements before they are sold. Harmful or illegal dietary supplements can stay on store shelves for a long time, sometimes even years, before the FDA can remove them. Because of this, it's important to be an informed consumer and understand the risks before deciding to use any dietary supplement. This booklet is designed to help athletes decide if the potential benefits of dietary supplements outweigh those risks, and if so, how they can better choose a low-risk product.

A: The dietary ingredients found in supplements can also be found in foods. In fact, by law, dietary supplements can only contain ingredients that are already in the food supply. However, dietary supplements are highly processed, and there is always a chance of contamination during the manufacturing process. Who would you rather have manufacture your calcium: a factory or mother nature?DIETARY SUPPLEMENT: According to the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA ) of 1994, a dietary supplement is defined by law as a product taken by mouth (a patch or a cream is not legally considered a supplement) that contains a \"dietary ingredient\" and is intended only to supplement the diet. A supplement cannot advertise to treat or cure a disease or ailment of any type. DEFINITION DIETARY INGREDIENTS: The dietary ingredients contained in supplements may include vitamins, minerals, herbs or other botanicals, amino acids, and substances, such as enzymes, organ tissues, glands, and metabolites. Dietary supplements may also contain extracts or concentrates of dietary ingredients, and may be found in many forms, including tablets, capsules, softgels, gelcaps, liquids, or powders. They can also be found in other forms, such as a bar, if the label does not represent the product as a conventional food or as a replacement for a full meal or diet. A dietary supplement can also be a liquid if the information on the label makes it clear that it's not a standard beverage or drink for the sole purpose of rehydration. Regardless of the form, the DSHEA places dietary supplements in a special category under the general umbrella of \"foods,\" not drugs, and requires that every supplement be labeled a dietary supplement.

A: All athletes need good nutrition, but it is up to each individual to determine whether that nutrition is best obtained through foods or supplements. Under certain circumstances, some dietary supplements may be helpful to athletes. It is important to first evaluate the nutritional needs of the athlete, and then identify whether increasing the intake of certain vitamins, minerals, or other ingredients is necessary. The steps below can be used to determine if an athlete might need a dietary supplement. TALK WITH A PROFESSIONAL TO ENSURE THE TRAINING PROGRAM IS OPTIMAL (and includes proper recovery time)1 MAKE SURE THE ATHLETE IS GETTING ENOUGH SLEEP (no supplement can make up for lack of sleep)2 EVALUATE THE ATHLETE'S DIET (develop a nutrition plan that includes training & recovery)3 MEET WITH A DOCTOR TO IDENTIFY (THROUGH BLOOD OR OTHER PROPER CLINICAL TESTS) ANY VITAMIN OR MINERAL DEFICIENCIES OR OTHER HEALTH PROBLEMS THAT MIGHT LIMIT THE VARIETY OF FOODS (E.G., FOOD ALLERGIES OR GLUTEN OR LACTOSE INTOLERANCE).4EVALUATING AN ATHLETE'S NUTRITIONAL NEEDS In 2013, a Long Island doctor noticed that his patients were showing symptoms normally associated with anabolic steroid use, such as liver damage, blood clots, muscle pain, masculine features appearing in women, and even testicular shrinkage, infertility, and gynecomastia (breast tissue development) in men. These patients had all gone to the same chiropractor, who prescribed Healthy Life Chemistry vitamins by Purity First to each of them. Although the label of these products appeared normal and didn't list unusual ingredients for a vitamin, regulators discovered anabolic steroids in the products after investigating health complaints. The ensuing warning letter from the FDA was initially ignored by Purity First, and the contaminated products remained on sale until they were finally recalled and destroyed after further federal pressure. Although Purity First supplements are no longer on the market, stories like this are all too common, and the FDA's list of recalled supplements grows longer all the time. It's important for consumers to remember that the label does not always paint an accurate picture of what is, or isn't, in a supplement. Even simple, safe-looking products from seemingly reputable companies can be contaminated with dangerous ingredients that can cause serious health problems and violate anti-doping rules. CASE STUDY REMEMBER, EVERY \"SAFE\" SUPPLEMENT CAN POSE A RISK. 7 6 Q: Should athletes buy supplements that advertise what they want to achieve? A: Because the benefits of dietary supplements are often inflated, the decision to use a product should be based on nutritional needs and not the often wildly exaggerated promises the product makes. Despite the claims a dietary supplement company might make in its advertising, there are no regulatory or enforcement agencies that check to make sure the advertisements are accurate. Federal law does not even require supplement companies to prove to the FDA that their products are safe or effective before they are sold. Because of this, athletes and consumers should ignore advertising and focus instead on the research about the individual dietary ingredients, such as basic vitamins and minerals. Advertisements for dietary supplements often make extremely exaggerated claims. Sometimes dietary supplements with the exact same ingredients will claim to have completely different effects on performance. For example, whey protein is advertised to be the key ingredient in both weight-gain and weight-loss products, implying that the same ingredient somehow has opposite effects. The benefits listed on supplement packaging and advertising sound nice, but it's important to remember that what a product can do for an athlete doesn't always match up with the label. Athletes and the people who support them should carefully evaluate their diet and training regimen to figure out what ingredients aren't being obtained through food, and then choose a safer product that delivers that ingredient.

There are no demonstrated performance benefits aside from general good health. May benefit some female athletes between ages 13-18 or lactose intolerant athletes. Build bones and teeth. Can delay muscle fatigue in high-intensity training. In most studies, performance benefits are small and only experienced during short-duration, maximum-intensity resistance training. No benefit shown in aerobic activities or with \"on-field\" athletic performance. Offers some energy and performance benefits to adults, but its effects are not well studied in adolescents. Results are mixed regarding potential benefits of high nitrate- containing foods on athletic performance. The evidence that arginine in normal doses actually causes vasodilation is debatable. No performance benefit if diet provides adequate protein consumed at the appropriate times in relation to training. Necessary for production of red blood cells. Signs of deficiency include fatigue and irritability. Once normal levels are achieved in the blood, additional iron provides no performance benefit.Mega-doses can cause toxicity leading to nausea, vomiting, organ damage, and other adverse effects. High doses can cause kidney stones and heart problems. High doses can cause kidney damage, nausea, diarrhea, cramping, and upset stomach. Effects can be intensified if used with ADHD medications. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against kids using caffeine. Vasodilation can cause a sudden loss of blood pressure, dizziness, lightheadedness, and a loss of balance. High doses can cause thirst, bloating, cramps, diarrhea, reduced appetite, and fatigue. High doses can be toxic and side effects include stomach pain, nausea, and vomiting.Q: Is there evidence behind the benefits of using dietary ingredients? A: To determine which, if any, dietary supplements can benefit athletes, it is necessary to first evaluate the athlete's metabolic needs and diet. Since everyone is different, it is not possible to simply say \"all athletes need fish oil/vitamin D/branched chain amino acids (BCAAs)\" or that \"creatine improves the sport performance of every athlete.\" For example, creatine can help some athletes in a few specific instances (see Table 1) if they are not able to eat enough of the right foods, but there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Table 1 shows some of the potential benefits and risks of commonly asked-about dietary ingredients. To evaluate whether a specific ingredient would benefit an athlete, it is helpful to consult with a certified sports dietitian or other qualified healthcare provider. If you do not have access to someone with the credentials to help, you can also consult the TrueSport Nutrition Guide at TrueSport.org/Nutrition-Guide for information about dietary ingredients' effects on health and performance. If an athlete has an identified nutrient deficiency, the question becomes how to address the cause of the deficiency and how to best increase the intake of that ingredient. The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) recommends that athletes first try to modify what they eat. However, if it is determined that a food-first approach will not do the trick, then an athlete should undertake a thorough evaluation to minimize the risks around supplement use. 9 11 10 Q: What are the risks associated with dietary supplements? A: The use of unhealthy, low-quality, or unlisted ingredients, as well as manufacturers' failure to include all of a supplement's ingredients on the label, are big problems in the supplement industry. Even though there are many high-quality and safe dietary supplements on the market, there is always the possibility that the supplement an athlete chooses could contain dangerous or illegal ingredients. There are often no warning signs that a product is unsafe and many athletes have suffered health problems or had positive drug tests from using products that are incorrectly labeled or contaminated with dangerous ingredients, such as anabolic steroids, pharmaceuticals, or research drugs. Sometimes, risky or dangerous ingredients are even listed right on the label or identified by a confusing name. Supplements can also contain low-quality ingredients, or old or unstable ingredients that degrade very quickly. Other supplements might not even contain the ingredients on the label. The FDA and other organizations list many examples of tested products containing zero amounts of a listed ingredient. In some situations, this could lead to malnutrition if the athlete stops eating foods with the ingredient because they relied solely on the supplement. ARE YOU SURE IT'S WORTH THE RISK? 1113 12 Q: If a dietary supplement is the most realistic way to obtain necessary dietary ingredients, how do athletes pick the safest one? A: There is no risk-free way to choose a supplement, as the only way to have zero risk is to not use supplements. But, if athletes choose to use supplements, they can reduce the risk significantly by following the decision-making flow chart to the right. If using a dietary supplement is necessary, the best way to reduce the risk of using a low-quality or contaminated product is to choose one that is certified by a USADA-recommended third party. Visit Supplement Connect at USADA.org/Supplement-Connect for the most current recommendations. Q: What types of products should athletes avoid? A: If athletes choose to use uncertified supplements in spite of the risks, they should avoid using products with red flags, which are listed in the Supplement Red Flags section of this booklet. Keep in mind that this is no guarantee. USADA is aware of several dietary supplements that, on initial inspection, did not exhibit any \"red flags,\" but testing revealed that they were contaminated with experimental drugs! Athletes have also tested positive for performance-enhancing substances from supplements that appear completely safe based on the label. Because a supplement's label and contents are not checked by the FDA or anyone else before a product is sold, it is completely up to the manufacturer to accurately list the ingredients and the amounts. While there are many companies that make high-quality supplements and spend a lot of time ensuring the labeling on their products is accurate, there are also companies that are sloppy during manufacturing or deliberately spike their products with illegal ingredients that are not on the label. There have been many cases where seemingly safe or low-risk products ended up containing prohibited performance-enhancing drugs, even though there was nothing on the label that made the product appear unsafe.MAKE SURE YOU NEED A SUPPLEMENT (make sure the benefits outweigh the risks) USE PRODUCTS CERTIFIED BY A USADA-RECOMMENDED THIRD PARTY (see USADA.org/Supplement-Connect for current recommendations) IF YOU CHOOSE TO USE AN UNCERTIFIED PRODUCT IN SPITE OF THE RISKS, THEN ELIMINATE PRODUCTS WITH RED FLAGS. (see the Supplement Red Flags section) MAKE A DECISION KNOWING THAT IN SPITE OF YOUR DUE DILIGENCE AND CARE IN SELECTING A LOWER-RISK SUPPLEMENT, THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES. YOU CAN NEVER BE 100 PERCENT SURE THAT WHAT IS LISTED ON THE LABEL IS WHAT'S IN THE BOTTLE.DECISION-MAKING FLOW CHART CHOOSING A DIETARY SUPPLEMENT1 2 3 415 14 MORE OF WHAT YOU NEED...SALMON FILLETFISH OIL SUPPLEMENT Did you know that the fatty acids in many fish oil supplements are oxidized, reducing their nutritive value significantly?

Eating healthy fats will tip the balance toward a healthy cholesterol level, and will allow your body to balance your hormones naturally.

Olive oil Extreme growth hormone boost Pressed olives Monounsaturated fat 10g BEETSNITRIC OXIDE Did you know there is very little evidence backing the use of nitric oxide supplements? However, beets and other fruits and vegetables (arugula, celery, carrots, and rhubarb) are rich in nitrates, which your body naturally converts to nitric oxide to help with blood flow and stamina. Freshness matters. Once you grind something up into a powder and store it on a shelf, benefits may be reduced.

I won't discuss or utter the word \"supplement\" until all the most importance aspects of an athlete's lifestyle are addressed and optimized. It's crucial to evaluate an athlete's training program, their performance goals, their lifestyle habits, and how their diets can best support all of those factors. What vitamins and minerals do you recommend? Many athletes do fine without taking a multivitamin. With their increased caloric needs, they have more opportunities to get the nutrients they need in their food. I don't usually recommend any kind of multivitamin, even to elite Olympians and Paralympians. My approach is always food first. On the other hand, if an athlete has a clinically diagnosed deficiency, then we will treat it. For example, numerous athletes are diagnosed with sport anemias, and we treat those with an oral iron supplement. Our approach to supplements is very clinical. We don't ever dose an athlete with something unless there is a very good rationale for doing so, which means a blood test to confirm their current nutrients status. There are some athletes who we find have hemochromatosis, a genetic condition where iron levels build to toxic levels in the body. We would never suggest iron for those athletes. I will also recommend vitamin D to an athlete who has a low blood test value. Depending on the time of the year and if they're training inside or outside, I may recommend a low dose to get them through the winter months when sunlight exposure is limited. But, I warn them that more is not better. To that point, I had a bobsled athlete who I was treating for low vitamin D. The next time I saw her she complained of tingling in her fingertips. I sent her for a blood test and she had toxic levels of vitamin D. She admitted that she had tripled her dose because her coach told her she should take more. Her symptoms resolved once we got her back on the correct dose. Things like this can happen to anyone. In another case, the father of one of our athletic trainers ended up in the ER because of vitamin D toxicity. He didn't realize it at the time, but all the supplements he was taking for his eyes and skin were adding up to a mega dose of vitamin D, which then exacerbated his symptoms of diabetes. Not only did he not realize vitamin D could be toxic, but he didn't realize how much he was taking. A USOPC DIETITIAN'S PERSPECTIVE ON \"SUPPLEMENTS THAT WORK\" We asked Alicia Kendig Glass, Sports Dietitian at the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee, to give us her opinion on some trending supplements. 27 26 This is common when people take more than one supplement. Things end up \"stacking.\" Too much vitamin D can also block the absorption of other fat-soluble vitamins. What about creatine and protein powder? Many athletes ask me if they should take creatine. People just think this is a magic ingredient, but they don't know how it works or if their sport demands it. I always ask myself, \"Are the demands of the sport going to be supported by what this active ingredient does?\" I did have a vegan athlete who was a sprinter, and she wasn't eating the food sources for creatine. She responded well to creatine. But, if I'm working with vegan or vegetarian athletes, I will often start with making sure they are getting enough quality protein in their diet first. Another situation where more protein can be helpful is for older athletes who have an increased need for quick recovery and may have a more difficult time maintaining lean muscle mass. In some cases where an athlete must train smarter instead of harder, and they are having a hard time sustaining lean mass or consuming enough calories, a simple whey protein can help.What is a nitric oxide booster? Would you recommend it to athletes? Nitric oxide boosters advertise to increase blood flow to your muscles, therefore increasing your ability to perform and recover faster. I steer clear of any supplement that advertises to be a nitric oxide (NO) booster. Those supplements are too risky for athletes to navigate, as their ingredients claim to deliver the same results as substances prohibited in sport. On the other hand, there are great functional foods that can offer slight improvements in oxygen uptake and muscle efficiency. Beet juice, spinach, and celery are all rich in naturally found nitrates to improve muscle efficiency. Caffeine and energy drinks are everywhere these days. What should an athlete do if they're fighting sluggishness and fatigue? Caffeine can be beneficial for those athletes who tolerate it well. Some athletes are distracted or jittery when they ingest caffeine. It's not for everyone. I do not recommend that athletes obtain caffeine through supplements or energy drinks though, because oftentimes, the caffeine dose is listed as part of a 'proprietary blend,' which doesn't list the individual doses. This makes it difficult to be certain how much caffeine is actually consumed. Energy drinks are particularly bad because they can also contain hidden sources of caffeine or other stimulants like yohimbine. The cumulative effect of multiple stimulants can harm performance and health. We know that supplement labels can be inaccurate or unclear, so if an athlete doesn't like coffee (and it's hard to control the dose), we will recommend a No Doz or other over- the-counter product with a known amount of caffeine. What is carnitine? Can it help an athlete? I don't actively recommend carnitine. Athletes ask about carnitine because they have heard that it may help the body burn more fat. But a review of research is still not convincing and more evidence is needed to suggest that carnitine does indeed work for an elite athlete population - that principle applies for any dietary supplement ingredient. The evidence needs to be specific to an athlete's sport or discipline, and its effects on performance need to be convincing before actively recommending it. Can you tell us more about beta-alanine? When dosed properly, beta-alanine increases carnosine in the muscle, which then acts as a lactate buffer. For athletes whose efforts last 40 seconds to about four minutes, it can help delay anabolic metabolism, which is when your muscle has too much lactic acid built up to function optimally. 29 28 Beta-alanine is no magic pill - it just delays this threshold slightly. It can also be beneficial for training. Beta-alanine is found in meats, but in relatively low amounts, so its therapeutic doses can really only be ingested in supplemental form. The most effective supplementation protocols require a loading phase of 3-4 weeks at higher doses, then backing off to a lower dose for numerous weeks. Given this long duration of time needed to dose beta-alanine effectively, taking a high quality beta-alanine product can become rather costly. I had a high jumper once who was intrigued by beta-alanine because his teammates were taking it. I had to ask him, \"How is this going to help you? You are not even doing a lactate-accumulating sport!\" For the high jumper, I didn't recommended that he waste his time or money on dosing beta-alanine. Do you think athletes can benefit from taking probiotics? I'm a big fan of probiotics. There are many good food sources like yogurt, kefir, ceviche, and other fermented foods. I often recommend a probiotic supplement for athletes traveling internationally where finding trusted food sources overseas may be difficult. There is still a lot of research to be done in this area though. We are not in a place where we can pull out a menu of recommendations for probiotics. We have a lot to learn about all the different strains, how they are populated within various individuals, how high of a dose is required, and how long dosing of probiotics is necessary for various benefits. Research is suggesting that improved gut health has very wide health effects on the whole body, both mentally and physically. What is tart cherry? What can it do for athletes? I'm asked often about antioxidant mega-dosing and the use of functional foods like tart cherry to reduce the stress on the body from heavy training.Although there is evidence that tart cherry juice has benefits to fight inflammation for elite athletes, habitual consumption of it may not be necessary. I also remind athletes that tart cherry juice should not take the place of other recovery snacks that contain both carbohydrates and protein. There is no protein in tart cherry juice. If athletes do want high doses of antioxidants during high stress times of training or competition, it's better to get it through foods. Mega-doses of antioxidants in dietary supplement form can actually shunt training responses. One of the many benefits of training is to apply stress to the various body systems so that the body has the opportunity to recover stronger. Mega-dosing nutrients takes that opportunity away.

Athletes should consider these red flags while evaluating and researching any supplement they might use. Before using any supplement, please also explore all of the educational materials available on TrueSport.org and USADA.org, including lists that identify many supplements and manufacturers that are known to be risky for athletes and consumers. The manufacturer or company has received FDA warning letters or has been subject to other enforcement actions. Search for the company or product name on FDA.gov or FTC.gov .Products sold exclusively on the internet may raise a red flag. While there are some legitimate dietary supplement companies that only have an online presence, some companies deliberately avoid regulatory agencies by opening and closing websites quickly, or selling products online to the U.S. from other countries.SUPPLEMENT RED FLAGS HIGH RISK COMPANIESThe supplement label or advertising includes substances on the WADA Prohibited List, or in a general category of the WADA Prohibited List, such as anabolic agents or stimulants. Any product that is taken or applied to the body in a way other than simply eating it or swallowing it, such as skin patches, creams, injections, and drops. Also be wary of extra steps before swallowing, including placing the product under the tongue or swishing it around in your mouth. Product lists unrecognizable ingredients that seem out of place, or it lists ingredients by chemical names rather than common names. Ingredients have no clear, well-documented nutritional value. If you've never heard of an ingredient, then you should stop and do research first.Any of the following phrases or characters on a bodybuilding product label should be considered a red flag because they might indicate the presence of ingredient that is listed as a chemical formula.1 42 53 RISKY INGREDIENTS OR UNUSUAL USE INSTRUCTIONS 2 WADA Prohibited Substances 5 No Nutritional Value Listed4 Skin Patches Injections Drops *any extra steps to swallowing3andro *any other number with the alpha & beta symbols Unrecognizable Ingredients33 32 RED FLAG MARKETING Product claims to be \"FDA Approved,\" \"WADA Approved,\" or \"USADA Approved.\" These organizations do not approve dietary supplements. Advertising contains phrases like \"newest or \"what the experts don't want you to know.\" Product claims to be an \"alternative to prescription medication.\" Product claims to treat or prevent a disease, such as hormone imbalances, the common cold, flu, diabetes, and inflammation.The supplement is advertised to be a thermogenic or stimulant-based weight loss or energy product, a sexual enhancement product, or a hormonal or anabolic product. Companies often add stimulants, Viagra-like drugs, or steroids to their products so they \"work,\" but they might not list those ingredients on the label. The product claims to deliver the same results as a performance- enhancing drug, such as increased or decreased hormone levels, or increased muscle mass. The product is sold \"for research purposes only.\" Some companies evade FDA scrutiny by telling consumers their products are not for human use so they can claim it's not their fault if a consumer gets sick from it. The company website or blog sites claim the products are legal because the ingredients are not on the Controlled Substances Act. For example, the company may market their products as \"legal steroids\" or \"legal prohormones.\"Product is recommended by a gym trainer instead of a healthcare provider or dietitian. Product is not certified by a third-party certifier recommended by USADA.

This resource has introduced the potential benefits and risks of using supplements, but at the end of the day, it is up to each individual to figure out if the benefits of using supplements outweigh the risks. Regardless of whether you are a recreational athlete, elite-level athlete, or support an athlete, we encourage you to: Be aware of everything you use and consume. You are responsible for everything that goes in and on your body, whether through the eyes, ears, nose, mouth, or skin. Start checking your medications, from cold medicines to asthma inhalers, on GlobalDRO.com to see if they are permitted or prohibited in sport. Learn more about the risks associated with using supplements and visit Supplement Connect at USADA.org/Supplement-Connect to find ways to reduce your risk. If you think incorporating a supplement into your routine could be helpful, do your due diligence to research that supplement and manufacturer. And, keep in mind that there are no guarantees.
