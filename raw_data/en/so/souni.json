This unique combination creates a healing experience that is felt on multiple levels of consciousness as energy flows from the divine, through the unified field, into the Qi meridians of your body, and manifests in your physical form. Our experience. Dr. Kruse has a Doctorate in Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine. She is also a Reiki Master and practitioner of Qi Gong and Buddhist meditation. She works with people of all religious, spiritual, and cultural backgrounds and finds inspiration from the various ways that universal truth manifests in our world. What to expect. Your initial Extended Energetic Healing Session will take about 100 minutes, your follow-up appointments about 70 minutes. Your doctor will do a detailed intake with you to get a holistic view of your energetic and bodily systems. We often start the session with a tuning fork treatment and simple meditation to bring your awareness into your body, where all healing will ultimately take place. If you do not already know how to feel your own Qi, it is at this time that your doctor will teach you how to do so, as your presence and intention is an integral part of this healing. From here, your practitioner will place the acupuncture needles chosen to harmonize your root energetic pattern; in some places bringing needed nutritive flow of Qi and Blood, and in other places clearing out blockages and stagnation. Crystals will be chosen and placed on and around the body to create an energetic container and assist in our intention for the treatment. Your practitioner will then begin performing Reiki and Qi Gong while you rest. Your practitioner acts as a conduit for universe life force energy that will flow out of their hands and into your body. The acupuncture needles act like a bridge from which this energy can directly flow from the unified field into your internal energetic field. Your practitioner may share insights with you as they arise, or they may be saved for the end of the treatment when you debrief together. Your session will be sealed in love and light at the end of your treatment, but you may notice the benefits unfold over the coming days and weeks. How to prepare. No meditative or spiritual background is required; you can just relax during your treatment and the energy will flow all the same. If you do have a meditative or spiritual practice, it can be helpful to tap into this in the days leading up to your appointment. The day of your appointment it is best to avoid caffeine as this excites the nervous system and can make it more difficult to relax and tap into the stillness that is essential in spiritual healing. Similarly, it can be helpful to limit excessive scrolling of social media and the internet leading up to your appointment as this fills the mind with unnecessary clutter, trapping energy in the mind and preventing it from flowing smoothly throughout the entire body. Conditions Treated. Many people choose Extended Energetic Healing Sessions to work through anxiety, depression, energetic imbalances, and spiritual blockages. However, these sessions are useful for all conditions we might treat with Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine such as fertility, digestive disorders, pain, autoimmune diseases, headaches, insomnia, and more. These sessions are often done face-up but can also be done face-down if neck or back pain are of primary concern. Your treatment plan. The frequency and duration of treatments is different for each condition and each individual patient. For most conditions a typical course of treatment starts at 1x/week for about 5 weeks. During this time period you should notice some, if not significant, changes in your symptoms and ideally those changes have begun to stick. From that point, appointments will be spaced out based upon progress. If you are doing a bit better, we may ask you to return in two weeks, if you are doing excellent we may switch you to 1x/month maintenance appointments. Some patients prefer to do all of their appointments as Extended Energetic Healing sessions while others choose to intermix with regular acupuncture appointments. The best plan for you will be discussed in detail with your practitioner at the time of your appointment. "}
