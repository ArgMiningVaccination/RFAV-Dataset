PUNTA MITA 2023 SHAMANIC & TUNING FORK HEALING WITH SILKE FUCHS *Activity available in English & Spanish Tuning Fork Healing is a form of sound healing and can be greatly enhanced by the consultant's intent or focus on the problem they want to address: the frequency generated by the tuning fork(s) plus the intent of the consultant, which is hold together with Silke, create a powerful healing effect. \"Healing describes the process of putting something back into healthy resonance. The frequency is the sound we make. The intent is the energy behind the sound, the consciousness that is encoded into the sound\"* The Tuning Forks are applied to the acupuncture and acupressure points to access the body's meridians and chakra energy systems. As the body listens to the tones, it will naturally adjust itself/ change its frequency and come into balance. Tuning Fork Healing can release many types of stress or congested energy and allows the person to get in touch with his or her own essence. *From the \"Colour Sound Therapy Manual\". 1.1 BIOENERGETIC CIRCUIT IONIC + CHI MASSAGE + CHROMOTHERAPY WITH GISELLE OCHOA *Activity available in English & Spanish A modern eastern therapy of self detox based on ancestral techniques to generate balance in the vital centers and to create collective awareness of the importance of the self care of the 3 dimensions of life: body, mind and soul.

They are a living part of Nature, and, when in balance, can create harmony on the planet. Since we are part of nature as well, those elements are intrinsically linked with our own body: from our very first inhale to our last exhale, we engage with the element of air. In this introductory class, we will explore through practical exercises, how these elements are moving through us and how we can become more conscious of and reconnect with them on a deeper level - bringing more balance and harmony to our own body, our life and the planet.

Be Free. Feel Free. Diagnosis in evolutionary Quantum Tarot & Pendulum with Gaby Piccoli *Activity available in English The meeting consists of several phases: A meditation for thoughts to calm down. What was behind our internal dialogue begins to be seen through the quantum tarot. The diagnosis is everything we have discarded because it seems threatening to us, but without realizing that this material is what hinders our flow and keeps us stuck. At the time of orientation, we do a bypass in the mind to begin to free ourselves from that weight and for things to begin to flow. The group usually constellates based on a main theme and the contributions that are made are enriching for everyone.PUNTA MITA 2023 (based in Cusco, Per\u00fa) Sacred Space Holder & Midwife for Inner Transformation.
