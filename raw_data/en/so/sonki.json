Keywords Complementary and alternative medicine . Herbal drugs .Homeopathy .Prevalence .Paediatric emergency medicine Introduction Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is defined as a group of diverse medical and healthcare systems, practices and products that is not considered to be belong to 'mainstream 'conventional medicine [ 18]. As the names indicate, complementary medicine is often used in addition to conventional medicine, whereas alternative medicine is practised instead of it. The use of CAM has become popular and even gained some acceptance by the traditional healthcare establishment. Not only are guidelines to handling CAM being established for the treatment of chronically ill patients, but many medical schools, health insurers and hospitals have also begun incorporating CAM into their practices [ 6,12,29-32]. Most of the studies published to date on the frequency of the use of CAM have addressed specific chronic illnesses, reporting values of between 31 and 84% [ 2,9,24-26]. Children use CAM less frequently than adult patients, but there is an increasing tendency for CAM use by the paediatric population [ 4,21,29]. A recent study impliedEur J Pediatr (2009) 168:431 -437 DOI 10.1007/s00431-008-0765-3 Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00431-008-0765-3 ) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. T. J. Zuzak (*):I. Zuzak-Siegrist :G. Staubli University Switzerlandthat children with chronic illness were more than threefold more likely to use CAM than healthy ones [ 14]. Informa- tion on the use of CAM in children who are not chronically ill is sparse. Surveys on paediatric emergency departments in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Canada showed that 12 - 15% of the parents were treating their child with CAM [ 13, 20,23]. It has recently been shown that several socio- cultural factors may affect the frequency of the use of CAM, resulting in strong regional variations [ 3]. The prevalence of the use of CAM by paediatric patients in Switzerland is largely unknown. A previous study by our intensive care unit implied that 18% of the parents of critically ill paediatric patients had turned to some form(s) of CAM therapy [ 16]. The aims of this study were: (1) to determine the prevalence of CAM in paediatric emergency medicine, (2) to characterise users and non-users of CAM, (3) to determine parental approaches to the administration of CAM to their children and (4) to survey the wishes of parents in terms of the use of CAM in paediatrics. Patients and methods Patients and study design The study was an analytical cross-sectional survey of paediatric Emergency Department patients that was under- taken between October 2006 and March 2007 at the University Children 's Hospital of Zurich. The study was approved and conducted in accordance with the ethical standards set by the Hospital Ethical Review Board. Questionnaires were offered by the ward clerk to parents (or other caretakers) while they were registering the child. The caretakers were asked to fill in the questionnaire, sign the consent form and hand it back to the ward clerk, the nurse or the front desk before leaving the department. German, English, French, or Italian versions of the patient information sheet, consent form and questionnaire were available. The questionnaire was completely anonymous. Exclusion criteria were: (1) previously filled-in question- naire, (2) inability to read or write German, English, French or Italian, (3) resuscitation/emergency patients, (4) children unaccompanied by a parent or another caretaker and (5)patients with emotional issues, such as child abuse or psychiatric problems. All other patients were eligible for the study. A multiple-choice questionnaire consisting of 34 multiple-choice questions was used; all disciplines that have been an integral part of the primary care in Switzer- land until 2005 (homeopathy, herbal medicine, anthroposo- phic medicine, traditional Chinese medicine including acupuncture and Ayurveda) were specified [ 15,30]. A pilot questionnaire \u2014distributed to 20 families \u2014was conducted to ensure the readability and clarity of the questions. Thereafter, minor revisions of the questionnaire \u2014mainly involving its layout \u2014were made. Results The use of CAM at the paediatric Emergency Department Of the 1600 questionnaires distributed, 72% (1158) were returned. Of these, 1143 questionnaires were available for data analysis, 95% of which were in German. Fifteen returned questionnaires were not entered into the database as less than 50% of the questions were answered. Questionnaires were filled in by a patient 's mother (65%, n=701), father (32%, n= 3 5 3 )o ro t h e r s( 1 % , n=12). Of the respondents, 58% ( n=665) reported that the patient had received some form of CAM \u201425% of all respondents (n=291) at present illness, 49% ( n=557) at former illnesses (Table 1). When both past and present illnesses were considered, only 31% of all respondents ( n=354) mentioned that the CAM therapies had been prescribed by physicians, whereas 50% ( n=575) used CAM as self- medication (non- prescription drugs). When only the present illness was considered, 13% ( n=147) reported that the CAM therapies were prescribed and 19% ( n=222) that CAM were not prescribed by physicians. When only former illnesses were analysed, 24% ( n=274) of all respondents reported having used some form of prescribed CAM, whereas 43% ( n=487) had used it as self-medication.

The age of the mothers of the CAM users, but not that of the corresponding fathers, was significantly higher than that of non-users (29.4 vs. 28.5 years, p<0.001). An intact familiar structure was more often declared by non- users of CAM than by users (91 vs. 87%, p<0.05), with single mothers appearing more frequently among the CAM- users (10 vs. 7%, p<0.05). Of the patients, 91% had been born in Switzerland, and no significant difference in this parameter could be found between users and non-users of CAM. With respect to the country in which the patients ' parents had been born, however, there were significant differences in the two groups, with 69% of the mothers and 65% of the fathers of the users, compared to only 54% of the mothers and 56% of the fathers of the non-users, being bornin Switzerland ( p<0.001 and p<0.01, respectively). The educational levels of the mothers and fathers were signifi- cantly higher ( p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively) in the group of CAM-users (47 and 57%, respectively) than in the group of non-users (42 and 50%, respectively). Household income and the type of health insurance were identical in the two groups, only the prevalence of an additional insurance for CAM was twice as high in the user group as in the non-user group (64 vs. 37%, p<0.001). All age groups were similarly represented among the patients using CAM during the present disease: 22% were 0-1 years years; 22.28%, 10 -16 years.

Presenting disease and use of CAM therapies Twenty-nine percent of the 460 (42% of total) patients which consulted the Emergency Department because of an infection and 19% of the 416 (38% of total) patients which consulted the Emergency Department because of a trauma used CAM (Table 3). The use of CAM by patients with infectious diseases was significantly higher ( p<0.01) and that by trauma patients was significantly lower ( p<0.01) than the mean rate of 26% CAM use when the entire patient cohort was considered.Reasons and personal preferences for using CAM within the family unit The goals of the parents for using CAM were multiple: to strengthen the immune system (44.36% of all CAM users, n=279), to improve the chance of being cured (39.75%, n= 250), to ensure that all possible medical options were utilized (31.32%, n=197), to achieve a better healing (30%, n=193), to stabilize the body (21.78%, n=137), to balance the inner harmony/mental situation (21.74%, n=136), to moderate the side effects of the conventional therapy (15.74%, n=99) and to avoid a relapse (9%, n=57). The use of CAM was preferred by the mother in 91.75% of cases ( n=612), followed by the father, 52.77% n=352), and finally by the child, 14.84% ( n=99). Administration of CAM therapies and physicians attitude towards CAM Whereas 62% ( n=368) of the CAM therapies were actually self medication (family members, friends), 28% ( n=167) were prescribed and 10% ( n= 58) by others (various answers possible). When the care- takers were asked if their physicians were familiar with CAM therapies, 22% ( n=229) answered that their physician is well informed on the subject of CAM and is her/himself a specialist in the field of homoeopathy (12%, n=126), anthroposophic medicine (4%, n=47), phytotherapy 2%, n=19), (1.8%, n=17) or other CAM (2%, n=20); 50% (n=521) answered that they had never talked with their physician about CAM; 5% ( n=48) answered that their physician is against therapies; 24% ( n=251) answered that their physician tolerates CAM, but does not care either way.

The distinction between users and non-users refers to the present illness434 Eur J Pediatr (2009) 168:431 -437Parental requirements regarding CAM therapies at the paediatric Emergency Department With respect to how they viewed the ideal situation in terms of CAM therapies and the physicians working at the paediatric Emergency Department, most study participants recommended that they should be able to propose and recommend CAM therapies themselves (51%, n=511), 40% ( n=399) of the caregivers answered that the physi- cians should (just) be informed about the CAM therapies used by the patients, their effects and side effects and a minority of caregivers (9%, n=86) answered that there is no need of specific knowledge for CAM (Table 4). Participants were also asked if CAM should be offered as a medical option by the Emergency Department. Forty percent ( n=396) required that physicians at the Emergency Department should be able to recommend CAM therapies themselves, 46% ( n=448) would have accepted CAM even instead of conventional therapies if the disease would have allowed it whereas 26% ( n=253) would accept CAM only in addition to conventional therapies; 17% ( n=362) of the participants answered yes, but with the restriction ofonly if the parents propose it themselves and explicitly want CAM, while 37% ( n=362) would appreciate informative docu- mentation instructing parents about the possibilities and limits of CAM at the paediatric Emergency Department. Participants were asked to what extent CAM should be offered at the children 's hospital in general (various answers possible). The majority (56%, n=553) stated that they would appreciate a hospital physician qualified in CAM therapies being at their disposal should they want so;29% ( n=291) of the participants recommended that a hospital physician should contact the parents actively and discuss the possibilities of CAM therapy with them; For 19% ( n=191) it would be enough if an external physician qualified in CAM therapies were to be at the disposal of the parents should they so desire such advice; 31% ( n=311) mentioned that there should be a special department in the hospital where CAM therapies would be automatically applied when advisable. Finally, 34% ( n=340) would support a group of researchers in the hospital to investigate the CAM therapies. Discussion Every fourth patient presenting to the Emergency Depart- ment during the study period was using some form of CAM therapy during the present illness, which is clearly higher than the prevalence reported for other countries [ 13,20,22, 23], suggesting that CAM is frequently used by children in the German-speaking part of Switzerland. Much to our surprise, even 19% of patients presenting to the Emergency Department because of trauma received some form of CAM. The high rate of CAM use in Switzerland is confirmed by our survey showing that significantly more children of parents born in Switzerland were treated with CAM than children of parents born in other countries. The reasons for this distinction remain unclear. Possibly the high percentage \u201424% in our investigation \u2014of paediatri- cians in the German-speaking part of Switzerland with a special knowledge of CAM contributed to the high Table 4 Parental requirements concerning the use of CAM at the paediatric Emergency Department Parental requirements concerning the use of CAM n(%) Doctors knowledge at the Emergency Department concerning CAM ( n=999) -They should be able to propose and recommend CAM therapies based on professional knowledge. 511 (51) -They should know CAM used by the parents, their effects and side effects. 399 (40) -There is no need of specific knowledge. 86 (9) Prescription of CAM at paediatric Emergency Department (various answers possible; n=984) -If the disease permits, even instead of conventional therapies. 448 (46) -The doctors should recommend CAM themselves if the disease permits. 396 (40) -There should be an informative documentation instructing parents about the possibilities and limits of CAM. 362 ( 37) -But only in addition to conventional therapies. 253 ( 26) -But only if the parents propose them it themselves and want them explicitly. 163 ( 17) -No. 83 ( 8) Representation of CAM at children 's hospital (various answers possible; n=988) -A hospital doctor, qualified in CAM, should be at the disposal of the parents if they want so. 553 (56) -There should be a group of researchers in the hospital who study and investigate CAM. 340 (34) -In the hospital there should be a special department where CAM should be applied automatically when it is advisable. 311 ( 31) -A hospital doctor should actively contact the parents and discuss with them the possibilities of CAM therapy. 291 (29) -An external doctor qualified in CAM should be at the disposal of the parents if they so want. 191 (19) -There is no need for it. 99 (10) 100% was set as the total numbers of all respondents who had confirmed at least one of the statements made in each questionEur J Pediatr (2009) 168:431 -437 435frequency of CAM use. In this study, however, the paediatrician 's attitude towards CAM was estimated by the questionnaires filled in by the caretakers only. A direct questioning of paediatrician 's attitudes towards CAM deserves further investigation. The strengths of this study are: (1) the high number of respondents, (2) the high response rate, (3) the answering of the questionnaire in private and (4) the absolute protection of anonymity of the respondents. The major limitations of the study are: (1) the lack of clinical data, (2) the exclusion of patients who could not read or write German, English, French or Italian and (3) a rather wide definition of CAM. The description of the present illness was provided by the respondents themselves while answering the questionnaires rather then by referring to clinical data. While this approach has a number of drawbacks, it does have the advantages of preserving the respondents anonymity and keeping the work load of the study and corresponding budget rather low. The information on the disease of the patients provided by the respondents did, however, correlate with clinical data collected for outcome measurements (data not shown). Finally, in terms of the wide definition of CAM, we believe that this was crucial for our study, since it made the identification of the frequency of self-medication possible. We found no difference between the user and non-user groups in terms of age, sex and country of birth of the patients, household income or insurance status. However, the parents of CAM-users were relatively older at the birth of the patients, more often born in Switzerland and had a significantly higher education. An intact family structure was slightly more frequent among non-CAM users, whereas single mothers administered CAM more often, which is in accordance to our finding that mostly mothers prefer CAM therapies for their children in a familiar setting. Our results suggest that the boundaries between CAM-users and non-users are smooth and that CAM is of general interest. This result contradicts those of most previous studies in which marked differences between CAM-users and non-users were described, suggesting that the users constitute a well-defined group of people, well educated, often with chronic illness and high incomes [ 3,9,26]. Several studies have indicated that patients do not routinely tell their conventional healthcare givers that they are using CAM [ 1,7,11]. Reasons for this omission are: (1) the patients are not asked for this information; (2) the fear of being ridiculed; (3) the belief that their physician would have little information on CAM; (4) the conviction that CAM can not be harmful; (5) the conviction that the decision for CAM is a personal one with no need for a physician 's input [ 1,28]. On our intensive care unit, 41% of the CAM-users reported using this type of medicine without discussing it with the physician [ 16,19]. This highfrequency was supported by the results of our suvery in that half of the families using CAM did not discuss this with their physician Remarkably, nearly two-thirds of the administered CAM was not prescribed by a physician. This fact deserves immediate action from the health authorities, because: (1) self medication per se is a potential health risk [ 10,17,19], (2) interactions between CAM and conventional therapies are possible [ 10,26] and (3) the effects and side-effects of CAM are just beginning to be adequately investigated [ 4,5, 8,12,32]. Emergency medicine is viewed by most physicians as a classical domain of the conventional medical practitioner, with CAM being of negligible relevance. However, our observations indicate that parents of children admitted to a paediatric Emergency Department often demand that CAM be considered in the medical options and wish to have an open discussion about CAM therapies with the medical professionals. Such a discussion would shed some light on patient 's values, expectations and lifestyle and would certainly contribute to a more effective and fruitful physician -patient relationship [ 27].
