What you should do - If you think you became sick from consuming a recalled product, contact your healthcare provider - Check to see if you have recalled products - Do not consume, serve, use, sell, or distribute recalled products - Recalled products should be thrown out or returned to the location where they were purchased - If you become aware of recalled products being sold, you can report it to the [CFIA](https://inspection.canada.ca/food-safety-for-consumers/where-to-report-a-complaint/eng/1364500149016/1364500195684) - If you buy food products online, [follow our tips](https://inspection.canada.ca/importing-food-plants-or-animals/e-commerce/eng/1611781762268/1611781762471)and do not assume that the products meet Canadian requirements Consumers can spot caffeinated energy drinks and mixes that do not meet Canada's food safety standards by checking: - Caffeine level. The maximum allowed in Canada is 180mg in a single-serving. - Unilingual label. If the label is only in one language, or has no English or French on it, it means the product has not been produced for the Canadian market. - Required cautionary statements. These help consumers make informed decisions. High levels of caffeine may have adverse health effects for children, pregnant individuals, breastfeeding individuals, and those sensitive to caffeine. Exercising while consuming caffeine may lead to adverse health effects. Some of the side effects of consuming excess caffeine may include insomnia, irritability, headaches, and nervousness. Learn more: Similar recalls or alerts Additional information Background These [recalls](https://recalls-rappels.canada.ca/en/alert-recall/various-brands-caffeinated-energy-drinks-may-be-unsafe-due-caffeine-content-and) are part of an ongoing investigation. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) makes decisions about recalls based on its own investigation and health risk assessments provided by Health Canada. Follow-up activities together with reports and findings of sales of non-compliant caffeinated energy drinks have led to additional recalls. The majority of the recalled products were neither manufactured nor intended for sale in Canada, and have been imported by third parties and sold in stores across Canada. Consumers may have also purchased the products online. There are similar products in Canada that meet Canadian requirements and are not affected by the recall warnings. In Canada, energy drinks must not contain more than 180 mg of caffeine in a single-serving. These products also require cautionary statements to protect vulnerable populations, including children, and to provide information on the safe number of servings per day. These recalls were triggered by the CFIA's inspection activities and were not associated with reports of reactions to the recalled products. Canadian Food Inspection The CFIA's food safety investigation of caffeinated energy drinks that do not meet Canadian requirements for supplemented food is ongoing. Should additional information become available or additional products be found to be affected, the CFIA will continue to notify the public by posting recall information on the [Recalls and safety alerts](https://recalls-rappels.canada.ca/en) website and issuing food recall warnings when required. The CFIA is verifying that industry is removing recalled products from the marketplace. The CFIA and Health Canada are working closely to address non-compliance issues, while continuing to communicate to industry and consumers about the potential adverse health effects of high caffeine levels, Canada's related labelling requirements, and making informed purchasing decisions when online shopping.
