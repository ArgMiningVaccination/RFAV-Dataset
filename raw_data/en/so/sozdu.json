Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Catalog 2022- 2023 12 1.8 Student Membership in Programs A full -time graduate student is a member of either two or three academic entities, depending upon his or her level of progression to the PhD degree. 1.8.1 Membership in the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Upon enrollment, a student becomes a member of the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and is subject to the rules defined herein. Continued enrollment shall require satisfa ctory performance. Dismissal shall be done only by the Dean, upon recommendation of the Promotions Committee and appropriate appeal procedures as described in this Policy Book. 1.8.2 Membership in a PhD Program (Revised 07/01/22) Entry into a PhD Program shall make the student a member of that entity. The Program may impose additional policies and performance criteria that strengthen or modify the overall policies of the Graduate School, but those policies may not diminish nor elim inate any academic requirements. Membership in a PhD Program and continuation of any established financial support shall continue provided that the student is in good academic standing and is making satisfactory academic progress toward the degree. The lat ter criteria include punctual performance of administrative tasks such as choosing a major advisor , appointing a TAC, choosing a scientific research project acceptable to that Committee, and completing required academic documents (such as status reports, C ommittee meetings and the dissertation) within specified time limits as defined in the policy handbooks of the Graduate School and the Program. Dismissal from the Program shall be done by the Program Director, following review of the student's past and cur rent performance by a Committee appointed by the Program Director. The members of that Committee shall include at least one member of the student's TAC. A faculty member who has a conflict of interest in the matter shall not serve.

If the student wishes to continue enrollment in the Graduate School, the Graduate School s hall provide a period of no more than 8 weeks with full stipend and insurance support for the student to transfer to another Program, unless that period of support has previously been granted to the student for the purpose of finding another laboratory. If unable to gain acceptance by another graduate program within 8 weeks, the student will be deemed unable to make academic progress and will be dismissed from Graduate School in accordance with GSBS Policy 6.8.1. 1.8.3 Membership in (Revised 03/31/04, 08/01/11, 08/16/19, 8/1/20) A student shall choose a Major Advisor by mutual agreement subject to Graduate Program approval (also see 9.2.1) . Membership in a laboratory is a privilege; during the student's traineeship time in that laboratory , the student and major advisor are expected to conduct science and scholarship according to high ethical principles as defined for faculty members in the BCM Faculty Handbook, and the Research Ethics standards defined in the BCM Administrative Guide. Continued membership in the major advisor's laboratory shall be assumed, unless unforeseen circumstances occur. Those circumstances include (1) loss of funding by the faculty member for the conduct of the research; (2) academic or scientific miscon duct by the student or advisor, causing dissolution of the bond of trust between student and faculty member; or (3) other disagreements which break that bond of trust. Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Catalog 2022- 2023 13 Major advisors and their students should work to construct a mutually agreeable set of expectations for the relationship, including time spent in research activities in the laboratory or other locations. However, in the case that a major advisor or student wishes to terminate the student's membership in the major advisor's lab, the initiating party (student or major advisor) must contact the Program Director. In the case that the Program Director is the student's major advisor, the program's Associate Director or a member of the program's Program Executive Committee (PEC) shall fulfill the role of the Program Director. The Program Director will review the circumstances in separate meetings with both the major advisor and student to determine whether differences between the student and major advisor can be resolved. The Program Director, at his/her discretion, may utilize the Thesis Advisory Committee as a resource or request a joint meeting between the two parties. The Request to Leave Laboratory Form will be completed and signed by the Program Director, co-signed by the major advisor , student and the student's Committee and sent to the Graduate School for approval. The effective date for leaving the laboratory will be the effective date indicated on the form. The request to leave a laboratory must also contain a signed agreement between the major advisor and student concerning the student's authorship status on any publications resulting from the student's work while in the laboratory. Decisions regarding authorship should be made in accord with the BCM Policy on Authorship (Section 02.9.40) and in the spirit of the Authorship Policy of the Graduate School (Section 9.12). After termination of the student -mentor relationship, the P rogram Director shall assume the temporary duties of advisor, and shall intercede actively to assist the student in finding a new Major Advisor. If the action is initiated by the major advisor , the major advisor must provide the student at least 4 weeks o f stipend and insurance support following the official termination date of membership in the laboratory. Terminating the membership of a student in a laboratory does not constitute discharge from the Program. If the student wishes to continue enrollment, the Program is obligated to provide an additional period of no more than 8 weeks with full stipend and insurance support for the student to find another laboratory or to transfer Programs. 1.8.4 Effort Required for Satisfactory Progress Towards Degree (New 08/16/19) Students are expected to attend academic activities and/or conduct research daily, Monday -Friday, unless prior arrangements are made with their Major Advisor and/or Program Director. An absence that has not been approved in advance is considered 'unexcused'. Approval for absences must be obtained in advance from the student's Major Advisor, or Program Director if the student does not have a Major Advisor. In the event of a n absence due to illness, the student should immediately notify the Maj or Advisor or Program Director. In the event of an emergency or extreme illness, the student should ask a representative to contact the Major Advisor or Program Director on the student's behalf. In the case of special or unforeseeable circumstances (such as a natural disaster or flood), the Dean may provide an exception to these attendance or absence approval requirements. Major Advisors must notify the student's Program Director if their student has an unexcused absence of greater than three successive business days. Students with unexcused absences of more than 5 successive business days may be placed on Administrative Leave of Absence with attendant loss of stipend until such time that the student returns to their academic and research activities. 1.9 Student Interest Groups (New 07/30/12, Revised 8/24/15, 08/01/16, 07/01/22) Official student interest groups may be designated by the Dean upon the request of the Graduate Student Council or Postdoctoral Association. The designation as a r ecognized trainee interest group entitles the group to develop content for the Graduate School Student Organizations web page and to use BCM and Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Catalog 2022- 2023 14 its logo in publicizing their activities. Interest groups must abide by all C ollege policies concerning use of the BCM name, logo, and internet/social media , as well as the GSBS Student Organization Handbook.

It does not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, sexual orientation, color, national or ethnic origin, disability or age, in administration of its educational policies, admissions policies, scholarship and loan Program s, and other school school -administered Program s. 3.3 Student Disability Policy ( New 8/2 7/15, 08/01/16) BCM provides equal educational access for qualified students with disabilities in accordance with state and federal laws including the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended in 2008, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the BC M Student Disability Policy (Section 23.1.07). 3.4 Acceptance of Admissions Offers (Revised 04/22/03 , 8/1/20) The BCM Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences is a member of the Council of Graduate Schools (CGS). According to the bylaws of the CGS, applicants have no obligation to accept an offer before April 15. While the BCM Graduate Program s can encourage accepted app licants to commit to an offer prior to April 15 to aid the Program in establishing the optimal entering class, the student does not have to declare before that date. The provisions of the CGS state: \"Students are under no obligation to respond to offers of financial support prior to April 15; earlier deadlines for acceptance of such offers violate the intent of this Resolution. In those instances in which a student accepts an offer before April 15, and subsequently desires to withdraw that acceptance, the student may submit in writing a resignation of the appointment at any time through April 15. \" However, an acceptance given or left in force after April 15 commits the student not to accept another offer without first informing in writing the institution to which a commitment has been made that they are withdrawing their acceptance of an offer, prior to accepting a second offer . Similarly, an offer by an institution after April 15 is conditional on presentation by the student of the written release from any previously accepted offer. It is further agreed by the institutions and organization subscribing to this Resolution that a copy of the Resolution should accompany every scholarship, fellowship, traineeship, and assistantship offer.\" 3.5 Deferral of A dmissions Offer (New 7/1/21, Revised 07/01/2022) A candidate who has been made an offer of admission may request deferral of their matriculation to graduate school such that enrollment would take place at the beginning of the subsequent academic year. Requests for deferrals must be justified. Approval of a deferral request is not automatic, and requires recommendation by the graduate program to which the student applied. If approved, a deferred admissions letter issued to the student will specify the da te in the next academic year by which the student must notify GSBS Admissions whether they will or will not use their option for deferred admission. If the student does not enroll by the end of the deferral period, they must re -apply to graduate school if they desire to be admitted at a later date. 3.6 Reinstatement of Admission (New 04/13/06, Revised 08/24/15) Students who withdraw or are dismissed for academic reasons, or who receive a terminal M.S. degree from BCM Graduate School of Biomedical Science s must reapply for admissions before they may be reinstated as a student. A student who is dismissed on the basis of misconduct is ineligible to reapply. 3.7 Retention of Admissions Records (New 04/13/06, Revised 7/1/21) In accordance with BCM Admissions Records Policy (Section 23.1.01), matriculant admissions records, with the exception of letters of recommendation, screening evaluations and interview evaluations will be Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Catalog 2022- 2023 19 retained as academic records and become part of the student's permanent file maintained by the Registrar. Letters of recommendation, screening evaluations and interview evaluations are retained until student enrollment, which trigge rs destruction of these materials. Admissions records of non- matriculants are preserved until the class for which they applied enrolls. Once the enrollment period ends, these admissions records are destroyed. ARTICLE 4. FINANCIAL REGULATIONS 4.1 Tuition (Revised 07/01/22 ) Tuition for a full -time course of study for one school year (5 terms, minimum of 12 credit hours per term) is set by the Board of Trustees. All students will be charged full tuition during their entire graduate school career. Students who are enrolled for less than the entire academic year are charged on a proportional basis in accordance with the Institutional Tuition an d Fees Policy (Section 23.1.04). 4.2 Financial Assistance (Revised 11/15/02, 08/01/16) All students receive an annual stipend while enrolled as full time students in the Graduate School. The amount of the stipend and any individual exceptions are established by the Executive Council and Dean. The stipend is continued as long as the student is making progress toward the degree. The BCM Financial Responsibilities, Financial Aid Eligibility, and Satisfactory Academic Progress Requirements for Students policy (Section 23.1.02) outlines academic standards for financial aid eligibility. The Office of Student Financial Aid considers all applications for loans with the exception of the Emergency Loan Fund. Emergency Loans may be obtained through the Graduate School office. 4.3 Outside Employment The first obligation of students is to their graduate studies. Students should arrange their financial affairs so that employment during the academic session should not be necessary. However, if the need arises, they should consult their Graduate Program Director . 4.4 Financial Responsibility (Revised 08/02/10) Graduate students are expected to conduct their financi al affairs in such a manner that their personal accounts and outstanding loans through the Graduate School remain current. Student fees (other than student health insurance, tuition and facilities fee) are the responsibility of the graduate student and must be paid by September 1 and February 1. For non- payment of their student fees (by the published deadlines) the student is charged a late fee by Student Account Services and a hold is placed on the student record blocking on -line registration, the postin g of grades, production of transcripts and graduation. Charges for tuition and the facilities fee are cleared from the student account when scholarships are applied automatically. The Bursar processes scholarships at the beginning of each semester (in July and January). The Dean can, at his/her discretion, discontinue tuition scholarships and/or refuse registration in those instances where there is no progress toward reducing the indebtedness. ARTICLE 5. REGISTRAT ION 5.1 Academic Year (Revised 07/01/22) The academic year spans approximately August 1 to July 31 and is composed of five terms, designated 1 through 5, each of 10 weeks in duration. All students begin their studies on the 1st day of Term 1 unless extraordinary circumstances justify beginning at another date. Students seeking an alternate start date should submit a written request to their Program Director. If the Program Director supports the request, they will transmit the request to the Graduate School Dean. Off -cycle admissions are permitte d only if approved by the Dean. Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Catalog 2022- 2023 20 5.2 Deadline for Registration (Revised 08/23/04 , 08/16/19, 8/1/20) The student will be billed a $ 25.00 late registration fee when registering after the stated deadline. If a student fails to register by the end of the 6th business day of the term, they may be administratively withdrawn from the Graduate School. 5.3 Program of Courses 5.3.1 Course Schedule (Revised 08/16/19 , 8/1/20) The Graduate Program pre- registers students for most courses, and students may self -register i n CAMs during designated Open Registration periods. Changes to course registration after the close of Open Registration up to the end of the 6th business day of the term require notification to the Program Administrator. Changes to course registration aft er the 6th business day of the term require the approval of the Program Director (see 5.5 for courses that start after the first week of the term). After appointment of the Major Advisor, approval is indicated by the signature of the Program Director and the Major Advisor. 5.3.2 Research Rotation Requirement (New 06/15/06, Revised 08/16/19) Research rotations begin to teach students how researchers approach biological problems. A rotation is expected to provide an introduction to the laboratory's research goals as well as instruction in basic laboratory skills. Rotations also familiarize the students with different laboratories in their Graduate Program and facilitate the ultimate selection of a Major Advisor. A typical research rotation lasts a whole term, but students may split a rotation in consultation with the Program Director. The number of credits earned in each rotation is adjusted so that the combination of research rotation and all other courses sums to a total of at least 12 credit hours per term. In order to maximize the benefits of the research rotations, students are required to complete a minimum of three research rotations in different laboratories (or three full terms in the case of split rotations). All rotation mentors must be members of the Graduate Faculty. The first and second research rotations must be done with a rotation mentor who is a member of the student's graduate program. Subsequent rotations may be done with a mentor -qualified member of the Graduate Faculty outside of the student's Graduate Program with approval of the PEC. Students and faculty are encouraged to discuss the potential for joining a laboratory during or after the rotation. However, students need the opportunity to explore various laboratories without pressu re. Therefore, faculty will make no commitment and will not request commitment from a student prior to completion of three rotation terms. Official appointment of a major advisor can be approved only after the completion of three rotation terms. The thr ee-rotation requirement is managed and monitored by the individual Graduate Programs. Exceptions: Students may choose to work at BCM during the summer before matriculation and count the summer research as one rotation, pending approval by the Graduate Prog ram Director. Permanent employment at BCM prior to matriculation (e.g. as a research technician), or research conducted outside of a BCM degree granting program, cannot be counted as a rotation. MD/PhD students who participate in research during their ini tial MD training period may count their experience as one rotation pending approval by the Graduate Program Director and in consultation with the MD/PhD Program Director. Students who transfer to BCM with their advisor after joining his/her laboratory in another institution are exempt from the three -rotation requirement but are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the work done in other laboratories in their Program. Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Catalog 2022- 2023 21 5.4 Course Load (Revised 08/16/19 , 07/01/22) The PhD degree requires a full -time program of study, and a ll students must be enrolled for at least 12 hours of credit each term. Students who have been admitted to candidacy, will be automatically registered by their Program administrator for 12 hours of dissertation each term. The number of contact hours required for coursework and research credit are defined in the BCM Credit Hour Policy (Section 23.1.11). A student wishing to take more than 17 term hours per term must obtain written permission from their Major Advisor , and have the approval of the Dean. 5.5 Course Changes (Revised 8/27/15, 08/01/16, 08/16/19, 8/1/20 ) Throughout the first six business days of a term , registration may be changed with notification to the Graduate Program Administrator and the Graduate School. For courses that do not start in the first week of the term, registration may be changed within 6 business days of the first class meeting with notification to the Graduate Program Administrator and the Graduate School. These changes are not reflected on the transcript. After that time through to the midpoint of the course duration, a student may withdraw from a course with the approval of the Graduate Program Director and the Major Advisor (if applicable) and notification of the Graduate School office. Withdrawal is designated on the transcript by the symbol WD. Withdrawal after the midpoint of the course duration, but prior to the final exam date, must be appr oved by the Dean of the Graduate School. The notation on the Transcript will be WD. If the Dean does not give permission to withdraw, the notation will be I (incomplete) or F ( Failing) depending on the student's performance prior to the date of withdrawal. The BCM Course Repeat Policy (Section 23.1.09) outlines how repeated coursework is listed on student transcripts. 5.6 Dissertation Registration A graduate student may not register for dissertation until a TAC has been appointed, the Qualifying Examination has been successfully Pass ed, and the Program has proposed the student for candidacy. 5.7 Retroactive Credit Credit cannot be given retroactively for a course in which a student was not officially enrolled. 5.8 Inter -Program Transfer (Revised 01/13/97, 07/29/13) Once a student has committed to a specific Program , it is expected that the course of study will be pursued to completion. In exceptional circumstances, students may transfer from one Graduate Program to another upon approval by the director of each of the Program s concerned and by the Dean; however, it is the student's responsibility to present compelling reasons for such a transfer. Before a transfer request can be initiated, all parties must be certain that the resident Program has not been able to address the concerns of the student. Neither Program will approve such a transfer without consultation between the directors of both Program s. Students are encouraged to consult with the Graduate School administration if they feel that conditions have arisen necessitating an inter -Program transfer, and may appeal disapproval by their current Program to the Dean, who will have the final authori ty for approval. Any transfer will be noted on the student's permanent record upon submission of \"Interdepartmental Transfer\" form. Even i f the student has been admitted to candidacy prior to transfer, the new Program may require that the student complete all requirements for admission to candidacy in the new Program. 5.9 Audit Students (Revised 11/08/07, 8/1/20, 7/1/21) BCM graduate students are allowed to audit any courses offered by the graduate school for no credi t and without examination if the course director approves. If a student wishes to audit a BCM graduate school course, the student must register for an audit and obtain permission of their Program Director and the course director. Registration is completed by using the Add/Drop Form. For the course to be listed on the student's transcript (without any credit hours awarded toward graduation), the student must submit to the Graduate School a course syllabus (dates, lecture titles and lecturer name) in which the student's attendance at 70% or more of the classes is documented by the lecturer's signature for each lecture Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Catalog 2022- 2023 22 attended. An audit student may not take examinations. If the student fails to submit an attendance document by the last day of the term, they will be withdrawn from the course and it will not appear on their transcript. Other i ndividuals may audit Graduate School courses under the following conditions: The individual is a full-time student of an institution with which BCM has a reciprocal agree ment, or a member of the BCM faculty or staff. Should the auditor be a BCM employee, written consent is required from the faculty employer, the course director and the Graduate School Dean. Upon recommendation of the course director , transcripts will bear the course name and will be marked audit . No more than 15 term hours of audit or course credit may be accumulated by anyone other than a full -time student. 5.10 Special Students (Revised 01/16/04 , 8/1/20, 7/1/21) Baylor College of Medicine associated p ersonnel who hold a Bachelor 's or higher degree , but who are not students , may with permission, register as Special Students for courses offered by the Graduate School and its Program s. Individuals who hold an active offer of admission but have not yet mat riculated, are also considered to be Special Students and may take graduate courses before they matriculate, by permission of the Dean. Special Students may not take courses through the reciprocal agreement with another institution. Written consent is req uired from the faculty employer, the course instructor and the graduate school. A special student may register for a maximum of 15 total term hours of course credit and/or audit credit . Any credit hours for which grades of C or F are received count toward the 15- hour limit. Petitions for exception should be directed to the Dean of the Graduate School. The performance of special students is subject to review by the Promotions Committee and a grade of C or lower may be grounds for the graduate school to ref use permission for enrollment in subsequent courses. BCM graduate students will be given priority for courses with limited enrollment. 5.11 Inter -Institutional Student Registration - Reciprocal Agreements (Revised 06/15/06, 07/30/12, 08/16/19) In addition to full -time students accepted in the PhD and MD/PhD Program s, matriculated full -time students in a school with which BCM has a reciprocal agreement (Rice University, Texas A&M University, University of Houston, The University of Texas Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, and The University of Texas School of Medicine may take courses for credit without going through formal admissions procedures or paying tuition. The established BCM procedures for registration must be followed. BCM graduate students may take graduate level courses at reciprocating institutions under the same conditions . BCM students can register for inter -institutional courses only when the course is approved by the student's Program, offered at the host institution for graduate credit, and when a comparable course is not offered at BCM. During the registration process (Inter -institutional registration form), the Graduate School will evaluate the effectiveness of inter -institutional courses in supplementing the BCM curriculu m and in meeting the overall goals of the student's Program. Registration must be approved by the student's Program, the BCM GSBS, the host institution and the host instructor. BCM students must comply with all of the requirements of the institution offe ring the course ( e.g., background checks, immunizations, etc.) 5.12 Floating Holidays and Term Breaks (New 08/01/11, Revised 07/01/22) Courses, exams, or other required activities will not be scheduled on the day after Thanksgiving, nor during Graduate School term breaks. For students in research courses, including research rotations, arrangements for time off should be made with the student's major advisor or program director for students without a major advisor. Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Catalog 2022- 2023 23 ARTICLE 6. ACADEMIC REGULATIONS 6.1 The Grading System and Assigning Credit 6.1.1 The Grading System (Revised 04/15/98, 04/26/02) Grade Description A Honors Work B Passing Work P Passing Work C Marginal Work MP Marginal Pass -Research Courses Only I Temporary Incomplete Work F Failing Work A grade of C or F does not confer credit toward Graduate School degree requirements. MP only applies to research related courses (Special Projects, Research Rotation and Dissertation). Incomplete (I) is to be used only to represent incomplete work; no other use of the grade is to be accepted. The grade may be carried no longer than three terms. After the third elapsed term, the I automatically becomes an F. For all courses that are graded without objective examination (e.g., graded on attendance) only grades of P ( Pass), F (Fail) or I (incomplete) can be used. These include but are not limited to Readings (courses numbered 548) and Seminar (courses numbered 466). Grades of P ( Pass), MP (marginal Pass ) or F (Fail) are to be used for Special Projects (courses numbered 435), Research Rotations (courses numbered 549) and Dissertation (courses numbered 550). In all courses ( School of Medicine and Graduate School), all students must be graded on the identical criteria. If a Program wishes additional crite ria for its students in a required course, such criteria should not be reflected in the recorded grade. Please refer to the institutional Course Rep eat Policy (Section 23.1.09) for criteria for calculating repeats in coursework. 6.1.2 Assigning Academic Credit (2/29/12, Revised 8/27/15, 8/01/16, 07/01/22) The academic calendar of the Graduate School is divided into five academic terms. For non - research courses, each term is of 10 weeks duration, divided into 8 weeks of instruction time, followed by one week of exams and one week of break time . Terms 1 and 2 are offered in the fall (August -December), terms 3 and 4 occur in the Spring (January -May) and Term 5 occurs in the Summer (May -July). Credits for coursework (term hours) are awarded on the basis of the Carnegie Unit. A term unit of credit is equal to one hour of lecture, seminar or small group discussion time per week or three hours of labora tory research activity per week. One term credit hour is equivalent to 0.5 semester credit hours. If the calculation of credit hours using the convention specified above is a non- integral number, the credit hours will be rounded to the closest integer. P lease refer to the institutional Credit Hour Policy (Section 23.1.11) for additional guidance on how academic credit is awarded and for overall guidance on the number of credits required for each BCM degree. 6.2 Grade Changes (Revised 08/23/04, 8/27/15, 08/01/16) Grades submitted by the faculty become final on the official date that grades are due each term. Grade changes for other than numerical error are discouraged. If an exam is re- evaluated, all students' answers to the affected sections of the exam are subject to review. Grade alterations affecting one student only, must be justified on the basis of a mathematical or related error. Requests to change final grades must be submitted in writing by the course director, with the approval of the Program Director , to the Promotions Committee. The request must specifically state the reason for the change. If student concerns regarding final grade are not resolved thr ough discussion with the course director, students may choose to proceed Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Catalog 2022- 2023 24 with a formal grade appeal. Guidance for the appeal process, inclusive of timeline, is outlined in the BCM Student Grievances Policy (Section 23.1.08). 6.3 Student Evaluation (Revised 0 6/15/06) Students are encouraged to complete evaluation -of-course/instructor forms at the end of each term , including courses taken at other institutions through inter -institutional agreements (see article 5.11). The Graduate School office shall distribute these forms for each service course to each student engaged in classroom -based course work. Completed forms are to be returned to the Graduate School, before the end of the subsequent term, where they will be collated and sent to the respective course directors. 6.4 Transcripts All grades and academic actions will be permanently recorded on the transcript. Students may be provided with unofficial copies of transcripts. Official copies will be released only by written request of the student to the Registrar's office. 6.5 Unsatisfactory considered to be making good academic progress unless they have been placed on Academic Warning, Academic Probation or recommended for dismissal. Graduate students are expected to maintain satisfactory progress toward the degree. One or more c redit hours with the grade of C, MP, F, or I makes a student subject to review by the Promotions Committee . The Promotions Committee will take one of the following actions: 1) Place the student on Academic Warning; 2) Place the student on Academic Probation; 3) Recommend the student for dismissal to the Dean; 4) Other action deemed appropriate by the Promotions Committee . In the case of a grade of MP or F in a research -related course, the student's TAC and Program Director will be notified as soon as possible by the Graduate School. If a TAC has not been established, the Program Director will be notified . The Program Director or designee will meet with the student and major advisor. A plan of remediation, signed by student, major advisor, Program Director and TAC (if appropriate) must be submitted to the Graduate School within two (2) weeks of the preceding term's grade submission deadline. Before assigning a grade of F in a research -related course, the major advisor must notify the Program Director of th e reason(s) for the grade, document ing that the student has been given written warning of their unsatisfactory performance and potential remedies. A student must be making good academic progress when granted permission to write and at graduation for either the MS or PhD degrees. 6.6 Academic Warning (Revised 04/ 13/06, 11/08/07, 07/14/14) Any student who receives one to three credit hours of C, or one instance of MP (in a research- related course), will be placed on Academic Warning by the Promotions Committee . The Promotions Committee will notify the student, in writing, of its decision.

During the childbirth/adoption accommodation period, the student may be assigned some reasonable reading, writing, data analysis or other activities that may be accomplished without being present at BCM . The student is expected to make prior arrangements to submit work needed for the completion of any requirements missed during the accommodation period (e. g. status reports or course requirements) when the graduate student returns to the College. If th e accommodation requires the student to miss classes or exams, the student may make arrangements to complete these requirements after returning or the student may withdraw from the course. Accommodations for Breastfeeding Mothers as defined by BCM policy (Section 02.2.50) are available to students. 8.6 Pursuit of Other Degrees While Enrolled in the GSBS (New 08/02/10) Students in the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences are expected to devote their academic efforts entirely to the PhD/M.S. Programs. The GSBS does not enroll students on a part -time basis. BCM students may pursue multiple degrees while enrolled as a BCM student only if they are part of an official joint/dual degree Program of BCM (i.e. MD/PhD or School of Medicine Research Track/M.S.). Enrollment at another institution (such as the UT School of Public Health) that may be required as part of a BCM degree Program is permitted as are th e completion of courses at other institutions for BCM credit that are covered by a reciprocal agreement for education (i.e. Rice, University of Houston, The University of Texas -Houston, Texas A&M, and UTMB -Galveston). ARTICLE 9. PROGRESS TOWARD THE DEGREE 9.1 Oversight (Revised 06/16/08) Students must continue to make satisfactory progress toward their degree. The student should set goals toward completing their studies with the assistance of the TAC and the Director of Graduate Studies their Program . Before appointment of the student's TAC, the Director of Graduate Studies of the student's Program is responsible for advising and mentoring the student. After the appointment of the TAC , the student is under the direction of a faculty preceptor supported by the student's TAC . Through the status Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Catalog 2022- 2023 35 report meetings, the TAC regularly report s the student's progress to the Director of Graduate Studies who conveys the status reports to the Promotions Committee of the Graduate School. 9.2 The Major Advisor & TAC 9.2.1 Appointment of Major Advisor and Advisor/Student Compact (also see 1.6.3) (New 04/22/03, Revised 06/16/08, 08/16/19) The Major Advisor is the Chair of the student's TAC. In the case of co- advisors, the senior faculty member is the chair, unless one of the co- advisors is designated as the major advisor. The Major Advisor is responsible for providing mentorship and direction in helping the student develop research skills and the ability to do independent research. The Major Advisor must be selected by the student and the selection must be agreed to by the Major Advisor and the Graduate Program by the beginning of the student's second year. The Major Advisor must be present at all meetings of the TAC. Upon appointment of the Major Advisor the Student and Major Advisor should review and sign the Compact between Students and their Major advisors and return a signed copy to the Graduate School. 9.2.2 Appointment of Thesis Advisory Committee (Revised 04/22/03, 08/23/04, 11/08/07, 06/16/08, 08/16/19, 8/1/20) Each student will be provided with advice from a faculty group charged with oversight of the student's academic, technical and professional development . Before appointment of a TAC, the Program Executive Committee (PEC) shall perform this role. T he student's TAC must be appointed by the end of the third term of the ir second year in residence, but may be appointed earlier and students are strongly encouraged to meet with their TAC as soon as practical after the Committee is appointed. TAC members agree to provide the student with oral and written feedback on their progress two times each year at TAC meetings and to fulfill their commitment to attend these meetings. The TAC mediates academic disputes between student and major advisor in issues that relate to the scope and content of the doctoral thesis, time in program and conditions for graduation. If the TAC cannot resolve a dispute, it should refer the dispute to the graduate program leadership via the R eporting or other member of the TAC. This Committee shall consist of a minimum of five members: the C hair of the Committee (the student's Major Advisor, who must be a member of the Graduate Faculty with an appointment in any Program offering a graduate degree), one Reporting Member, two addit ional faculty members of the student's Program who must be eligible to train students , and at least one external faculty member . The requirement for a Reporting Member applies to students matriculating in 2019 and thereafter. The Reporting Member is an e xperienced faculty member of the graduate program who is responsible for monitoring student progress and reporting back to the Graduate Program . The external committee member must hold an academic appointment in a medical or academic institution in the gr eater metropolitan Houston area that is in a department different from the primary academic appointment(s) of the Major Advisor(s) and should not be a member of the student's graduate program. The Graduate Program Director or their designee is an ex offic io member of the TAC. Additional members can be appointed to the TAC at any time. There is no upper limit to the membership of the TAC, and additional members do not need to be members of the Graduate Faculty, so long as a majority of the TAC members is eligible to train graduate students in their respective programs and institutions. The student and/or their Major Advisor(s) may invite guests to participate in TAC meetings in a non -voting capacity, but the Reporting Member may Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Catalog 2022- 2023 36 ask them to leave a TAC meeting for discussion pertaining to academic progress to degree or dispute between student and Major advisor. Members of the laboratory of the Major Advisor(s) are not eligible to serve on the student's TAC. Spouses or domestic partners of the Major Advisor are not eligible to serve on the student's TAC. This restriction applies to all TAC appointments, beginning in 2019. The Committee shall be appointed by the Dean upon written request from the Graduate Program Director . The student and Major Advis or suggest the two program faculty and the external faculty member and select the Reporting Member from a pre- approved group of Reporting Members designated by the PEC. The PEC can modify the composition of the TAC when necessary. Requests to change the composition of the TAC are made in writing by the Graduate Program Director to the Dean. The TAC shall be responsible for monitoring progress made, and for petitioning , with the approval of the Graduate Program Director , to the Dean for exception to any academic regulations. The TAC may also participate in mediating potential disputes that may arise between the student and the Major Advisor . It shall review requests for dismissal of the student submitted by the advisor and approve or oppose such requests. In these cases, a temporary Chair will be appointed by the Program Director from the TAC members. The TAC's decisions shall be reported in writing by the temporary Chair to the Program Director who shall inform the Dean regarding substantive changes in the student's progress or status. The TAC administers the final oral examination component of the thesis defense and approves (by signing) the final copies of the student's dissertation. All members of the TAC must be present at the thesis defense. In the case of unforeseen extenuating circumstances, the student, Major Advisor, and Graduate Program Director may petition the Dean for an exception. 9.3 Appeal of TAC Decisions (Revised 06/16/08) A student or a Committee member , who disagrees with a TAC decision, may appeal in writing to the Dean. 9.4 Status Reports (Revised 08/01/97, 06/21/02, 04/22/03, 03/31/04, 06/14/07, 06/16/08, 01/16/13) Gradu ate students, second year and above, are responsible for meeting with their TAC and submitting a status report at least twice a year. The purpose of these meetings is to ensure that students receive feedback and direction on their thesis research and to pr omote a timely assessment of progress toward their degree and to help plan future work. 9.4.1 Due Dates (Revised 06/16/08, 1/16/13) Status reports for second year students are due in the Graduate School by 5:00 p.m. on the last business day preceding Dec ember 24 (Year 2 Fall Status Report) and the last business day in June (Year 2 Spring Status Report). For students third year and above, status reports are due by 5:00 p.m. on the last business day in the month of their birth and the 6- month anniversary of their birth month. For the purpose of these status reports, the month of July will count towards the Fall reporting period (e.g. a 2 nd year student with a July/January birthday should use the form 'Status Report - Year 3 Fall -Year 4 Fall). There are no extensions of these deadlines, but the TAC meeting may be held at any time between the deadlines. It is the responsibility of the student to schedule and hold the TAC meeting so that they are completed before the deadlines. Since scheduling difficulties ma y be encountered, the student should begin arranging the meeting significantly in advance of the deadlines. Committee members are expected to respond to the student's request for a meeting in a timely fashion and to be as accommodating as possible in helpi ng the student arrange Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Catalog 2022- 2023 37 the Committee meeting. Unanticipated emergencies and other significant extenuating circumstances may be considered by the Dean on a case -by-case basis. 9.4.2 Status Report Contents (Revised 06/16/08, 08/16/19) The Status Report Form, which must be submitted after the completion of the status report meeting, includes a summary of the meeting prepared by the Major Advisor, an evaluation of the student's progress, and a completed signature page, as well as the student's written summary, and updated publication and award information. At least five days prior to the Thesis Advisory Committee meeting, the student will submit to all members of the Committee a succinct written summary of their accomplishments since th e last Committee meeting, including significant experimental findings, results and/or difficulties with an experimental approach, and the status of any publications. The status report should also include a brief description of plans for experiments in the coming six months. For meetings held during the spring of the student's fourth year and thereafter, a timeline (Section 9.4.2.1) must be submitted with the status report and reviewed by the TAC. The Graduate School strongly recommends that the status re port and the TAC meeting follow the guidelines published by the Graduate School (available from the Graduate School web site). 9.4.2.1 Status Report Timeline (New 06/16/08) The TAC should help ensure that the student is continuing to make timely progress toward the degree. By the spring meeting of the fourth year of enrollment, the student, major advisor, and TAC members must evaluate the student's progress and future plans for completion of the PhD. Before the meeting, the student, in consultation with the major advisor, should prepare a timeline that lists graduation requirements and estimated dates of completion, if possible (i.e. June 20XX, summer 20XX, or too early to predict). The timeline, which must be included with the Status Report Form, is intended to represent the best estimates at the time it is written. The timeline should be revised and updated at each subsequent status report meeting. The timeline should fol low the format guidelines established by the Graduate School (available from the Graduate School web site). 9.4.3 The Status Report Meeting (Revised 06/16/08, 08/16/19, 11/25/19) Status report meetings (except under the special circumstances described in Section 9.4.7) must include the Major Advisor, Reporting Member and at least two other members of the Thesis Advisory Committee. A Committee member (including the major advisor) may be present through teleconferencing or video conferencing arrangements. Substitution of an alternate Reporting Member is possible with approval of the PEC and/or Program Director. Students should not be pressured to bring food or beverages to TAC meetings; therefore, the practice is discouraged, but not prohibited. 9.4.4 Status Report Signature Page (Revised 06/16/08) Before the meeting ends, the Chair and Committee members will read any notes that might have been taken during the Committee meeting and together they will come to a consensus on the content of the summary state ment. Any Committee member who disagrees with the summary and evaluation may append a statement to the status report indicating the basis for their disagreement. The signatures of the major advisor, all Committee members and the student on the status report form denotes their presence or absence at the meeting and indicates their agreement with the evaluation and summary statement. If one or more Committee members write a dissenting statement, the signatures on the status report form signify that the Com mittee members and the student have read the dissenting opinion. Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Catalog 2022- 2023 38 If a student disagrees with comments in the summary statement or a Committee member's addendum, he/she may submit a written rebuttal to the status report describing the disagreement. The rebuttal must be submitted within one month of the date of the Thesis Advisory Committee meeting with a copy of the disputed status report. The rebuttal statement must be signed by the Major Advisor , all members of the Thesis Advisory Committee and Program Director in acknowledgment that they have seen it and discussed it with the student. Signatures of the Thesis Advisory Committee , including the Chair , do not indicate that they agree with the student's objections. The signed statement should be submitted to the Graduate School for inclusion in the student's file. 9.4.5 Permission to Write (Revised 06/10/08, 08/03/09, 08/02/10, 08/01/16, 08/16/19, 7/1/21) By granting Permission t o Write, the student's Thesis Advisory Committee acknowledges that all key e xperiments have been completed, and a thesis outline describing a sufficient body of work to merit a PhD if the dissertation and defense are satisfactorily completed , was presented and reviewed . To be eligible to request 'Permission to Write' status, stud ents who matriculate in 2019 or thereafter, must have at least one 1st or co -1st author manuscript accepted for publication in a peer - reviewed research journal on the topic of their thesis research. A co- 1st author publication is one in which multiple first/lead authors with equal contributions are designated. Exceptions to this requirement may be approved by the PEC, taking into account the recommendation of the thesis advisory committee. In addition, t he student, in consultation with the major advisor , must present a detailed outline of the thesis to the Committee at least two weeks before the meeting. The outline should present sufficient detail to judge the completeness of the experimental work with a c lear indication of which portions of the experimental work are finished and which remain to be completed. The Committee expects that the student will complete all requirements and defend the thesis before the next status report deadline, and a timeline for completion of the written thesis and the oral defense should be set at the time P ermission to W rite is granted. Permission to W rite is not automatically renewed, and if a subsequent status report meeting is held, permission to write must be requested ag ain. A quorum of the Thesis Advisory Committee (Major Advisor, Reporting Member and two members) is required to hold a meeting to request P ermission to Write. Committee members unable to attend the meeting must review the proposed thesis outline and req uirements to complete proposed experiments , and if they concur with the Committee to award Permission To Write, sign the status report form in the appropriate section. A single dissent, even from a member not in attendance at the TAC meeting, is sufficient to prevent awarding Permission to Write. Once Permission to Write is granted, the primary responsibility of the student is to write and defend their dissertation. The student may continue to perform experiments in the lab if they and their major advis or agree, but the student is not obligated to do so. A student must be making good academic progress, including the completion of the required training in the R esponsible C onduct of R esearch Year 1, Year 2, Year 3 and Year 4 courses when granted Permission to Write. For students in the CSTP PhD program, t he ethics requirement can be met by completion of the Responsible Conduct of Research for Clinical Investigators course and Responsible Conduct of Research Year 3 and Year 4 courses . Ethics training require ments cannot be transferred from other institutions. \"Permission to W rite\" status does not relieve the student from any academic requirements including submission of status reports, attendance at seminars, retreats, and other activities required by the Program or the Graduate School. Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Catalog 2022- 2023 39 9.4.6 Late Penalties (Revised 06/16/08, 01/16/13, 07/20/13, 07/29/13) The status report meeting is an integral part of a student's progress toward their degree. If a report is not submitted by the deadlines specified for year 2, or year 3 and above students (Section 9.4.1) and the student has had no prior late penalties asse ssed at previous deadlines, the student will be assessed a $25 fine. If the completed status report is not submitted within 15 calendar days of the original deadline, an additional $50 fine will be assessed and if still delinquent after 30 calendar days fr om the original deadline, the student will receive a grade of F for Dissertation or Special Projects. The Thesis Advisory Committee will be notified of delinquent status reports. On the second instance of status report delinquency, the initial fine will be $50 and if still delinquent, 15 calendar days after the original deadline, the student will receive a grade of F for Dissertation or Special Projects. On the third instance of status report delinquency, the student will receive a grade of F for Dissertat ion or Special Projects immediately after the original deadline. A grade of F in Dissertation or Special Projects may be sufficient to cause a recommendation for dismissal from the Graduate School by the Promotions Committee (Section 6.8). The student may appeal the grade of F, any fines, and/or their dismissal through the appeals process of the Promotions Committee (Section 6.10). 9.4.7 Special Circumstances (Revised 08/02/10, 08/01/11, 01/16/2013, 08/16/19) Students who are standing for their final disse rtation examination (defense, or examination of a terminal M.S. thesis) no later than three months after their given status report deadlines (Section 9.4.1) may submit the \"Defense of Dissertation Date\" or \"Application for a Terminal M.S.\" form to the Grad uate School office in lieu of the status report if it is received in the Graduate School before the status report deadline. If the defense of the PhD dissertation or examination of the terminal M.S. thesis is not conducted on the scheduled date, a status r eport becomes due within 2 weeks. In cases of illness or other unexpected circumstances beyond the student's control that prevent the attendance of the student, major advisor, or a quorum of the committee (two members, student and major advisor), the Dean or designee may grant an extension of the status report deadline and waive any penalties. Remote students (Section 8.3) or students with Remote Advisors (Section 8.4) will be allowed to have one status report meeting conducted by teleconference without r eturning to BCM if this is approved by the student's Graduate Program. However, the status report and the Status Report Signature page must be completed and submitted on time. At least one Thesis Advisory Committee meeting a year must be held with the st udent present at BCM along with a majority of the Thesis Advisory Committee present (section 9.4.3), including the local advisor. The Remote Advisor must at least be present by phone or teleconference. 9.5 The Seven Year Rule (previously part of 8.1) 9.5.1 Monitoring student progress at the beginning of Year 6 (Revised 08/03/09, 07/20/13, 08/01/16, 7/1/21) The purpose of PhD training is for the student to develop the ability to function as an independent researcher. This includes maintaining steady prog ress toward completing the degree and the development of critical research skills and knowledge. This responsibility is shared among the student, his or her Major Advisor , the TAC and the Graduate Program . Once a student has entered their sixth year of s tudy (including time on LOA), unless they have already received permission to write, the student's Program Executive Committee will appoint an ex -officio member to the student's Thesis Advisory Committee from the Program Executive Committee or another Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Catalog 2022- 2023 40 designated member of their program faculty. The student or any member of the Thesis Advisory Committee may, at any time, request that the Graduate Program appoint an ex-officio member. The Promotions Committee , at their discretion, may place a n ex officio member representing the Promotions Committee on the student's TAC to monitor the student's progress toward the degree. The ex-officio member must be present at the Thesis Advisory Committee meetings beginning at the Fall status report of year six and continuing until the student sets a defense date. The role of the Program 's ex-officio member is to monitor the student's progress and to ensure that progress toward degree , alternative strategies, and an appropriate time -line for graduation has b een presented and discussed at the Committee meeting. The Program 's ex-officio member may not vote in any decisions of the Committee . After the meeting, a written evaluation ( ex-officio check list) must be completed by the ex -officio member and submitted to the Program Director for review. The Program Director should discuss the report with the student and their major advisor. The ex officio report is available to the Promotions Committee . For students with an appointed ex -officio member , a status report must be accompanied by the ex-officio report . 9.5.2 Extension of the Seven Year Rule (Revised 08/03/09 , 07/29/13, 08/01/16, 8/1/20) No more the 7 years may elapse between matriculation into the Graduate School, excluding leaves - of-absence and suspension, and completion of all degree requirements for the PhD degree. Unless a student will defend their dissertation by the end of their 7th year, they must present a detailed graduation plan a t the Spring TAC meeting preceding the beginning of the student's 8th year. The TAC will review the plan and determine whether to recommend a 6 -month extension of the Seven Year Rule. If the TAC recommends an extension, a graduation plan agreed to by student, major advisor, TAC and Program Director must be submitted to t he Promotions Committee within 2 weeks of the TAC meeting. If the TAC does not recommend an extension, it must provide a written summary of the rationale for their decision within 1 week to the student and Promotions Committee. The student can appeal the recommendation of the TAC to the Promotions Committee. The graduation plan must be updated and presented at each subsequent TAC meetin g, and the TAC must make a determination of whether to recommend a further extension of the Seven Year Rule. If the TAC recommends an extension, the updated graduation plan agreed to by student, major advisor, TAC and Program Director must be submitted to the Promotions Comm ittee within 2 weeks of the TAC meeting. If the TAC does not recommend an extension, it must provide a written summary of the rationale for their decision within 1 week to the student and Promotions Committee. The student can appeal the recommendation of the TAC to the Promotions Committee. The Promotions Committee will consider the recommendations of the TAC, the student's Program Director and the Program's ex -officio Committee member, in addition to the student's graduation plan, and make a recommendat ion to the Dean concerning the request to waive the Seven Year Rule with or without imposition of defense and/or graduation deadlines. If a student has defended prior to the beginning of their 8th year, a waiver of the 7 -year rule will be granted automatically to accommodate the two -month period for revision between the defense and the submission of the final thesis. 9.6 Credit Requirements (Revised 08/03/09 , 7/1/21) The PhD requires satisfactory completion of 180 term hours. A minimum of 60 term hours of course work is required (includes Special Projects, Research Rotation, Seminar and Readings and other courses). Thirty term hours of this requirement must be from didactic courses which either: 1) are designated as a 600 0 level course, or 2) have a letter grade assignment of A-F (\"letter graded\" courses) and are graded by objective criteria, or 3) are designated by the Curriculum Committee as \"approved Pass /Fail\" didactic courses (excluding seminars and journal clubs ). Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Catalog 2022- 2023 41 Any course counting toward the 30 -hour requirement must be approved by the Curriculum Committee. Special Topics courses (course number xxx -463 or GS -xx-5000) cannot be applied to the 30 -hour requirement. At least 24 of the required 30 term hours must come from courses assigning a letter grade; 6 term hours may come from the approved Pass /Fail category. For courses grades on a Pass/Fail basis that are offered for graduate credit at another institution or by the School of Medicine , more than 6 term hours of Pass/Fail courses can be used toward the 30 term hour requirement if the courses are required by a BCM Graduate Program and after review and approval by the Curriculum Committee on a case- by-case basis. \"Letter -graded courses\" must be graded A, B, C or F and grades must be assigned by objective criteria, i.e. by examination. Approved Pass /Fail courses must also use specific grading criteria. While such criteria may not include written exams per se , each approved Pass -Fail course must utilize appropriate assessment tools, consistent with the educational goals of the course: ( e.g. a paper, an oral presentation, homework, problem solving). The remaining 120 term hours may consist of any courses approved by the Curriculum Committee and listed by a Program in the catalogue, including dissertation research. Specific required courses might differ among the various Program s as long as they conform to the above requirements. At the beginning of the academic year, each Program will define their degree plan of s pecific course requirements (didactic and non- didactic), including any tracks or groups of flexible required electives for students matriculating in that year. The degree plan must be filed with the Graduate School and made available to all students matriculating in that year. Any request to change the required courses specified by the degree plan must be approved by the student's graduate program and the Promotions Committee. Students must repeat any required course when they receive a grade of C or F; however, the Program may determine if elective courses, including flexible requirements, must be repeated. 9.7 Transfer of Credit (Revised 04/22/03 , 06/14/05, 08/03/09, 06/18/15, 8/27/15, 08/16/19, 07/01/22) A student may request transfer of graduate level course work completed (with grades of B or above) at another regionally accredited academic institution , provided that the course (s) were taken within 5 years of the date of matriculation at BCM. Only those courses in which a grade is assigned as the re sult of an examination (not seminar, special projects, or research) will be considered by the Promotions Committee for transfer. Courses shown on the transcript for a previously conferred degree are not eligible for transfer. Course work completed at a university outside the USA will be considered on a case by case basis. A maximum of 60 term hours (30 semester hours) may be submitted for transfer . Of the 30 hours required for Admission to Candidacy, individual Programs may set different limits on the n umber of hours that may be transferred, but no more than 24 hours of transfer credit will be allowed. As an exception, BCM School of Medicine courses that are offered for Pass/Fail credit can be considered for transfer of credit and used toward the 30 te rm credit hours of didactic course work if specific grading criteria are utilized to evaluate student learning, and the course content has been reviewed and approved by the GSBS Curriculum Committee. BCM School of Medicine courses that are pre -approved for transfer credit by the Promotions Committee will be automatically allowed as transfer credit upon completion of a Transfer of Credit form. Other BCM School of Medicine courses will be considered by the Promotions Committee on a case- by-case basis. Student s may petition the Promotions Committee to waive specific course Degree Plan requirements based on prior completed graduate level coursework. Requests for waivers must be justified. Approval of a course waiver request is not automatic, and requires recomme ndation by the Graduate Program. Petitions should be submitted in sufficient time for the Promotions Committee to adjudicate before the required course begins. Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Catalog 2022- 2023 42 The specific courses transferred will not be listed on the graduate school transcript, only tota l credit hours transferred. Additionally, the Graduate School complies with the BCM Acceptance of Transfer Credit Policy (Section 23.1.05) that provides criteria for evaluating, awarding, and accepting transfer credit by examination, advanced standing and professional certificates. 9.8 The Qualifying Examination (Revised 11/13/96, 06/16/08, 08/16/19, 8/1/20) The purpose of the qualifying exam is to determine whether the student has sufficient general and discipline -specific knowledge, oral and written communication skills, and intellectual ability to successfully carry out independent, scholarly research that will satisfy the requirements for awarding of the PhD degree. The qualifying exam is administered by the individual Graduate Program s, following GSBS -wide guidelines . In general, the exam tests the ability of the student to formulate a significant scient ific hypothesis, to identify, develop and articulate an original approach to experimentally test the hypothesis and interpret the possible results, and to discuss the proposed project with respect to the relevant body of knowledge. All PhD students must ta ke the Qualifying Examination by the end of their 2 nd year of enrollment . The student must pass all pre -requisite activities defined by their Program before taking the Qualifying Examination with no more than three unresolved non- passing didactic/6000- level credits. Any exception must be approved by the Dean. Passing the Qualifying Exam is a requirement for Admission to Candidacy. Each Program's PEC selects up to 4 individuals to serve as Qualifying Exam Chairs. The Qualifying Exam Chairs jointly share the responsibility of chairing all qualifying exams in a given year. The Qualifying Exam Chairs shall recommend the examination date, and select members of the Examining Committee that shall consist of a Qualifying Exam Chair, two members of the TAC and two members of the program's faculty . If the TAC has not been appointed prior to the examination, the QE Chairs shall select two program members with expertise in the field of the proposal in place of TAC members. All members of the Examining Committee are voting members. The student's Major Advisor must attend the examination, but serves solely as a silent observer. It is the responsibility of the student to submit the completed Qualifying Examination Date form to the GSBS for approval prior to the date of th e exam. Once the examination date has been set, if any member of the E xamination Committee finds he/she cannot be present at the examination, he/she must inform the Dean in writing prior to the start of the exam. The GSBS Qualifying Exam Procedures and Rules document provides additional guidance on the conduct of exams. Transfer students must take the Qualifying Exam at BCM and all exceptions must be approved by the Promotions Committee. 9.8.1 Results of the Examination (Revised 08/29/97, 02/05/00, 11/08/07, 07/29/13, 08/21/14 , 07/01/22) All phases of the examination process must be complete before indicating a result on the \"Result of Qualifying Examination Form.\" There are three possible outcomes of a Qualifying Examination: Pass , Incomplete, or Fail. The result of the Qualifying Examination is certified by the Examining Committee, the Program Director, and endorsed by the Dean (Result of Qualifying Examination Form) . A Pass is awarded to students who successfully complete the examination. An Incomplete is used when the Examining C ommittee determines that the student's performance is inadequate and that additional requirements must be completed to remedy the deficiency. The additional requirements must be specified by the Examining Committee on the Result of Qualifying Examination Form, including a date by which the additional requirements must be completed (the Program Director and the Dean must sign the Result of Qualifying Examination Form). After the requirements stipulated by the Examining Committee have been satisfied, the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Catalog 2022- 2023 43 Examining Committee and Program Director will notify the Dean using the Result of Qualifying Examination Form and the student's academic record will be updated from incomplete to Pass . If the requirements to remediate an incomplete are not completed satisfa ctorily, the Examining Committee and Program Director will notify the Dean using the Result of Qualifying Examination Form and the student's academic record will be updated from Incomplete to Fail on the date the Program submits written verification of the resolution of the incomplete. A Fail is awarded if the student's performance on the Qualifying Examination is unsatisfactory, either at the initial examination or when an incomplete is resolved with a grade of Fail. Failure of the Qualifying Examination is reported to the Promotions Committee and the student will be placed on Academic Probation. A student who Fail s their initial Qualifying Examination may be recommended for dismissal to the Dean by the Promotions Committee . A second Qualifying Examinatio n may be taken only if recommended by the student's Program . Students remain on Academic Probation until successfully completing a second qualifying exam. The second examination must be taken within six months of the initial examination date. In the event of a second Failure, the student will be recommended for dismissal by the Promotions Committee .

The order of sections 9, 10 and 11 may be repeated or combined to facilitate production of the dissertation's chapters from the student's scientific publications. It is usual to choose to combine all methods sections together, but at the student's and Committee 's discretion sections may be kept apart for clarity. Similarly, results and discussion can appear together in discrete chapters separated by content or specific aims. These sections must, however, be reformatted to conform t o the dissertation style. Individual chapters may contain their own discussion sections. However, at the end of the dissertation the Summary and Significance section should re -capitulate the salient findings and conclusions of the work and place these obse rvations in the context of current studies in that field. The student is encouraged to use this section to speculate on the work's significance, and/or to recommend future avenues of fruitful experimentation. The dissertation is an academic document submit ted by the student to the Graduate School 10.2.2 Defense of the Dissertation 10.2.2.1 Scheduling the Defense of Dissertation ( Revised 11/11/99, 08/16/19) Within 3 months of receiving Permission to Write, t he student should identify their dissertation defense date.

Successful defense of the dissertation shall be indicated by Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Catalog 2022- 2023 48 the signatures of the entire Committee and the approval of the Dean (Result of Defense of Dissertation form). If unexpected circumstances prevent the occurrence of the defense, it shoul d be rescheduled as soon as possible. Any status reports that were waived because of the schedule defense become due. If there are any significant deficiencies of the thesis (other than typographical errors) that must be corrected before final approval, these should be indicated directly on the results form or on attached pages. A single dissenting vote is sufficient grounds for Failing the dissertation defense. Fail ure of the dissertation defense can be appealed to the Promotions Committee by the stude nt or the student's Major Advisor . The Promotions Committee may recommend to the Dean to uphold the Failure, award the PhD, appoint a new Committee and examination, or recommend another examination of the student by the same Committee . The defense of dis sertation should be satisfactorily completed at least one month before the intended date of graduation. 10.2.3 Submission of Completed Dissertation with Revisions (Revised 1/02/06, 08/03/09, 08/01/16, 8/1/20) The student should submit the final thesis and graduate as soon as corrections and requirements are complete.
