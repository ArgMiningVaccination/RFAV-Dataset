For over four decades, VTEUs have played a key role in the fight against infectious diseases. The VTEUs perform Phase 1, 2, 3, and 4 trials to develop new and improved vaccines and therapies, many of which have contributed to vaccine licensure. Currently awarded to nine university-based centers, the VTEUs provide increased capability to rapidly evaluate vaccines against emerging infectious disease threats, such as bioterrorism and pandemic influenza. Trials performed by the VTEUs led to licensure of a new seasonal influenza vaccine when shortages threatened the national supply. [Dr. Myron Levine](http://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/profiles/Levine-Myron/#d.en.227644) led the VTEU at the CVD for several decades. Since 2007, [Dr. Karen Kotloff](http://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/profiles/Kotloff-Karen/#d.en.228044) has served as Principal Investigator. The VTEU at CVD focuses on vaccines that primarily benefit persons living in developing countries, such as malaria, Shigella (the main cause of dysentery), typhoid, cholera, and group A streptococcus (the cause of rheumatic fever). In 1998, the CVD conducted the first clinical trial of an edible vaccine to prevent diarrhea. The CVD has led preventive and therapeutic vaccine trials for all age groups. We have conducted trials for vaccines against viral, bacterial, and protozoal pathogens presented in varying formulations (including combination vaccines, non-living ,and living strains) with different schedules and routes of delivery (oral, nasal, needle-and-syringe, and needle-free injection devices). The rich opportunities provided by the VTEU has contributed to the training of "}
