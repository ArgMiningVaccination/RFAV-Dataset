Financial Implications and Impact Statement : There are no financial implicati ons arising from this report. Recommendations : It is recommended that: (1) the Board of Health refer this report to Community Services Committee and the City of Toronto Advisory Committee on Homeless and Soci ally Isolated Persons for information; and (2) the appropriate City officials be authorized and directed to take the necessary action to give effect thereto. Background : The 2003 SARS outbreak highlighted concerns about infectious dise ases and infect ion control in homeless shelters and drop-in centres. At its meeting on June 24, 25 and 26, 2003, City Council recommended that staff proceed to establish a Co mmunity Reference Group to assist the City to develop an Infectious Disease Preparedness Protoc ol for these settings. Toronto Public Health (TPH) worked with Shelter, S upport and Housing Administration Di vision (SSHAD) to establish the Toronto Infectious Disease Preparedness Pr otocol Community (IDPPC) reference group. The reference group is comprised of infection contro l practitioners, research ers, TPH staff, SSHAD - 2 - staff and community stakeholders (Habitat Se rvices, Ministry of Community and Social Services, Ministry of Health and Long-Term Ca re - Community Health Division, Regent Park Community Health Centre, Seaton House Health Care, Sherbourne Health Centre, St. Stephens House, Street Health Community Nursing Foundation, The 519 and Toronto Community Care Access Centre). They recommended that an in fection control manual for homeless and housing service providers be developed. TPH has worked with SSHAD to create the manual which is designed to increase the capacity of frontline workers and managers in infectious disease management and infection control (see Appendix A). Comments : Community stakeholder involvement has been a ke y element in finalizing the content and format of the manual. Community members, employees in the shelter system, infection control practitioners and primary healthcare workers (i ncluding street nurses) participated in focus groups which allowed for a candid and lengthy revi ew of the many early drafts of the manual. The Toronto IDPPC reference group also reviewed the content, name and layout of the manual. The manual provides homeless and housing service providers with inform ation about infection control including routine practices, preventi ng the transmission of infection, outbreak management and food safety. Information sheets provide easy to unders tand information about various infectious diseases and infestations relevant to those living and working in the City's shelter and hostel system. TPH will provide all Toronto shelters, drop-in cent res and Out of the Cold programs with copies of the manual in the spring of 2006. TPH staff will conduct training workshops on the content of the manual in the summer and fall of 2006 for sta ff and management at each Toronto shelter and drop-in centre and with Out of the Cold staff. At the same time, TPH will provide training to the management teams in Toronto shelters on TPH' s new Pandemic Influenza Planning Guide for Homeless Service Providers. TPH's 2006 Operating Budget submission incl udes a budget enhancement developed in collaboration with SSHAD to hire one staff posi tion to provide infectio n control training, support and site-specific policy developmen t to reduce the risk of diseas e transmission in shelters. If approved, this position will support the ongoing use, implementation and updating of the Infection Prevention and Contro l Manual once the initial training sessions are complete. TPH will prepare and distribute information updates on specific content in the manual both in hard copy and electronically to shelters, drop-in centres and Out of the Cold programs as required. The manual will also be available on the City's website. TPH will receive feedback on the manual through Toronto Hea lth Connection at 416-338-7600. Conclusions : The IDPPC reference group recommended that an infection prevention and control manual be developed for homeless and housing service provi ders in response to the 2003 SARS outbreak and a TB outbreak in Toronto's hostel and shelter system. TPH, working in collaboration with - 3 - SSHAD, consulted with key stakeholders including in fectious disease expert s, public health staff and community members with expertise wo rking with the homeless and under-housed population. This manual and the training sessions will assist in protecti ng the health of those who live and work in Tor onto's shelter system.

This manual was written for homeless and housing service providers. It isa tool to help you get the information you need in order to stay healthy and reduce the risk of infection for everyone. This manual is based on research gathered from Canada and around the world. Many health experts(researchers, doctors, nurses) were consulted indeciding what to include and many frontline workersalso contributed through focus groups and one-on-onemeetings. You will find information ranging from the very general to the very specific. You will also findinformation sheets and posters, which we encourageyou to copy and hand out in your facility. In order toget the most from this manual, we suggest you readall of the information and attend a training workshopoffered by Toronto Public Health. This manual is in binder format with specific section tabs to allow easy access to information. Over time weexpect new information to be added and old information to be changed or removed. Updates to information in the manual will be sentout electronically. In the future, we hope to make this information available through theinternet. Hard (paper) copies will also be provided. As additions are released, you will beable to simply add them to the binder. Each section contains resources for furtherinformation or support should you have any questions or concerns. We hope you will find this manual to be a helpful tool and we look forward to receiving your feedback when you attend a training workshop and use this resource in yourworkplace.

Chapter 1 Homelessness and health Microbiology 101DefinitionsModes of transmissionHealth system roles and responsibilitiesPrivacy and confidentialityPublic health emergencies General KnowledgeGeneral KnowledgeHomelessness and health Many people in our City find themselves homeless or living in very poor housing. Some people find themselves in these circumstancesbecause of poverty, unemployment and a lack of affordable housing.For others, circumstances such as mental illness, drug dependencyand/ or abusive home environments can contribute to homelessness. People who are homeless, or living in poor housing, may find it difficult to maintain proper hygiene, stay healthy and fight disease and infection. It may be hard for them to getnutritious food, adequate sleep, exercise and follow-up healthcare services. These all play arole in making our bodies healthy and in preventing disease. In shelters and other homeless service programs large numbers of people may live together and regularly move in and out. People often share sleeping and bathroom facilities. Thismeans people may have contact with others who have an infection. One of the best defences against infection is to maintain a strong and healthy body. Those who provide services to people who are homeless or poorly housed should be constantlystriving to help them to maintain and improve their overall health as a way to preventinfection.General Knowledge March 2006 | Toronto Public Health 11General Knowledge Microbiology 101 Understanding what causes infection and disease is the first step in being able to prevent and control it. Microbiology is a science that studies microscopic(tiny) organisms, some of which can be infectious. What fol lows is a brief overview of some basic points in microbiology. You may also want to refer tothe list of definitions on pages 13-15. An infection happens when: A human infection happens when bacteria, fungi, parasites or viruses enter the human body andstart to multiply. The growth of the organism(germ) may cause symptoms in the infectedperson. After an infection, the fight begins: The bodies of most animals and people have verycomplicated defence systems called immunesystems. Immune systems are made up of manydifferent cells that can either directly fight theinvading organisms (germs) or cause the body toreact (e.g., with a fever) to kill the germs. Theimmune system is usually very effective in germfighting. It learns to recognize specific germs,rapidly detect and kill them if they enter the bodyagain.Infection vs. disease: Infection happens when an organism has enteredthe body. People can be infected with anorganism (germ) but have no signs or symptoms.Once the infection begins to have harmful effectson the body it is then called a disease. Thisdisease was caused by the infection. 12 Toronto Public Health | March 2006Definitions Airborne transmission Spread of infectious organisms (germs) through the air. These germs can survive in the air for long periods of time and travel fardistances from the infected person. Bacterium/Bacteria (plural) Bacteria are specific types of small cells that come in many different varieties. Bacteria can be found almost anywhere (e.g.,on your hands and in your food, etc.). Some bacteria are \"good\"and can assist in the digestion of food, the breakdown of garbageand many other important processes. Other bacteria are \"bad\"and are able to infect living organisms and cause disease. Blood-borne transmission Spread of infectious organisms (germs) through direct blood-to- blood contact (e.g., sharing of needles). Case A person who has, or is suspected to have, an infection. Cells People, plants, animals and most germs are made up of microscopic (tiny) structures called cells, which are the buildingblocks for most living things. Cells contain DNA, which is theblueprint or instructions for how the organism (person, plant,animal or germ) is going to look or function. Cohorting Housing all people who are sick with the same infection together to prevent further transmission. Contagious (infectious) An infectious organism (germ) that can be passed to another person. Communicable Infectious organisms (germs) which are capable of being transmitted. Common vehicle transmission Spread of infectious organisms to multiple hosts (e.g., animals or people) from one common source (e.g., contaminated food ormedication). Cleaning Removing visible debris (e.g., dirt) from a surface. Cluster A number of people within a specific group or area (e.g., a family, community) who all have, or are suspected of having, aninfection. Direct contact transmission Spread of infectious organisms (germs) from the skin of one person directly to another person.General Knowledge March 2006 | Toronto Public Health 13General Knowledge Definitions Disease When a person has a specific condition which is affecting the body in a negative way. This can lead to poor day-to-dayfunctioning, pain and/or decreased length of life. (A disease isdifferent from an infection but can result from an infection.) Disinfecting Using chemicals to reduce the number of germs on a surface to safer levels. Droplet transmission Spread of infectious organisms (germs) from an infected person in tiny droplets of fluid that can travel small distances (less thanone metre). Drug resistance When germs change so that they can \"resist\" being killed or affected by medicines (e.g., antibiotics). Epidemic A greater than expected number of people within a specific region (e.g., community, province or country) with a specificillness. Fungus/fungi (plural) A fungus is a plant-like organism, that invades or grows on other organisms and gets its food from that organism. Some fungi cangrow either on or inside people. Germ Germ is a common term used to describe bacteria, viruses, parasites or fungi. Usually, the word \"germ\" is used to meansomething that has negative or bad effects (i.e. causes sickness)on a person or animal. Indirect contact transmission Spread of infectious organisms (germs) by coming into contact with a contaminated object (i.e. a bathroom doorknob) and thenbringing the germ into your body (e.g., licking your fingers). Infectious organism (a germ) Bacteria, viruses, parasites or fungi that are able to infect people or animals. Isolation Separating infected people from healthy people so that the spread of an infection can be stopped or slowed. ( Isolation is different from quarantine. ) Mantoux Testing A tuberculosis (TB) skin test to find out if a person has TB infection. This test is also called a Tuberculin Skin Test. Microbiology A science which studies microscopic (tiny) organisms. Outbreak A local (e.g., household, school) increase in the number of people with a particular disease or infection. Pandemic An epidemic which involves a very large geographic area (i.e. one or more countries or worldwide). 14 Toronto Public Health | March 2006Parasite A parasite is an organism made up of one or more cells. A parasite is larger and more complicated than either bacteria orviruses. A parasite enters the body and gets nourishment fromthat person or animal. Sometimes parasites can cause symptomsand disease. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Equipment used to help protect a person from catching an infectious organism. Personal protective equipment can includesuch things as masks, gowns and gloves. Quarantine Separating well people , who have been exposed to an infectious agent (germ) from other people who have not been exposed , to reduce the chance of spreading the germ in case the exposedpeople have been infected. ( Quarantine is different from isolation. ) Reportable disease Specific diseases that must be reported to Public Health under Provincial law. Sanitize Using chemical cleaners to reduce the number of germs on a surface to safer levels. Sexual contact transmission Spread of infectious agents (germs) from an infected person to another person through sexual contact (e.g., vaginal, oral or analsex). Sputum test A test of mucous coughed up from the lungs (e.g., for tuberculosis disease). Sterilize Using special means to destroy all germs and/or organisms on a surface. This is usually done in specific settings (e.g., hospital,surgical equipment). Surveillance Continuously monitoring populations for infection and/or disease. Symptom screening Questions asked of a large group of people to see if they are likely to have a particular disease. Vector-borne transmission Spread of infectious organisms (germs) by insects. Ventilation Air flow or movement. Virus A virus is a microscopic particle, but it is much smaller than a cell. Like bacteria, some viruses are able to enter living organismsand infect them, which can result in disease. Viruses are differentfrom bacteria, as they are not made up of cells and are muchsmaller.Definitions General Knowledge March 2006 | Toronto Public Health 15General Knowledge Modes of transmission Infectious organisms come in different sizes, shapes and types. There are many types of bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses. Infections can be spread inmany different ways. With such diversity, there is no perfect way of preventinginfections. Routine practices are effective, but certain germs will require alittle bit more (i.e. enhanced precautions). All frontline staff should employRoutine Practices (see pages 24 - 29) and follow the advice of healthcare professionals when extra precautions are needed. Overview of some ways germs can be transmitted: Airborne transmission Spread of infectious organisms (germs) through the air. These germs can survive in the air for long periods of time and travel far from the infectedperson. Blood-borne transmission Spread of infectious organisms (germs) through direct blood-to-blood contact (e.g., sharing of needles). Common vehicle Spread of infectious organisms to multiple hosts (e.g., animals or people) transmission from one common source (e.g., contaminated food or medication). Direct contact Spread of infectious organisms (germs) from the skin of one person to transmission another person directly. Droplet transmission Spread of infectious organisms (germs) from an infected person in tiny droplets of fluid that can travel small distances (less than one metre). Indirect contact Spread of infectious organisms (germs) through contact with a contaminated transmission object (e.g., touching a bathroom doorknob) and then bringing the germ into the body (e.g., licking your fingers). Sexual contact Spread of infectious agents (germs) from an infected person to another transmission person through anal, oral or vaginal sexual contact. Vector-borne transmission Spread of infectious organisms (germs) by insects. 16 Toronto Public Health | March 2006Health system roles and responsibilities The health system is made up of a diverse group of people and agencies who work to promote health and treat sickness. This section is designed to giveyou an idea of the wide scope of services and people working to promotehealth in this community. Regulated healthcare professionals Regulated healthcare professionals include thosepeople who fall under the Provincial RegulatedHealth Professions Act. These professionals areallowed to perform certain procedures and/orassessments on patients, have certain reportingobligations in the law and are responsible for theirpractice. They are also licenced and monitored bytheir professional college, which sets standardsand can take enforcement action if necessary.There are 23 regulated professions in Ontario*and they include (but are not limited to): Physicians and Surgeons Registered Nurses, Registered Practical Nurses and Nurse Practitioners Chiropractors Dentists Midwives Occupational Therapists Psychologists * As of June 2005 Other health workers/ professionals There are many individuals who have specific training and/or experience, which allows them todeliver a wide range of health-related services topeople. The services provided by healthworkers/professionals include health promotion,personal support and even advanced emergencymedical care provided by licenced paramedics.Community Care Access Centres (CCACs) Community Care Access Centres (CCACs) provide one-stop access to health and personal supportservices to help people to live independently inthe community or assist them in making thetransition to a long-term care facility. They alsoprovide information about, or link individuals to,services available in the community. Anyone canmake a referral to a CCAC. Hospitals and community health clinics/centres The health system is also made up of hospitals and community health clinics/centres. Communityhealth clinics and centres offer many primaryhealth and promotion services to people within aspecific community. Some community healthcentres receive specific funding to work withhomeless people and families. Hospitals offer awider range of services than can be found in thecommunity and tend to focus on providing acuteor complex illness care to those in need. Hospitalscan range from smaller community-based centres,to larger institutions that can offer morespecialities, teaching and research services.

In fact, this is a requirement of the law. Allinstitutions that deal with the public have policies in place to make sureclient privacy and confidentiality are respected. But respecting privacyultimately depends on you. It is essential that we always remember to respecta client's privacy as a matter of trust*. Betraying this trust will not onlyreflect badly upon you as an individual, but it will also affect yourorganization's ability to effectively serve the public. Out of sight? When dealing with client files, lists, names, etc., make sure they are out of sight of the generalpublic. Remember to close files, be discreet withappointment lists and keep written materials awayfrom the front or public desk. When not in use,client files should be stored in a secure area andlocked. Within earshot? If you must discuss a client's health issues with acolleague or a private matter with a client, makesure you do so in a private space. People have aright to have their personal details kept private. Aswell, clients may not be open with you if they feelothers might be listening.Who needs to know? Think carefully about who needs to be involved indiscussing a client's health issues and whatexactly they need to know. Never give informationabout a client to a client's family member, friendor to an outside agency* without the permission ofthe client. In order to build trusting relationships, privacy is EVERYONE'S responsibility! Confidentiality and public health There are occasions when public health agencies (government agencies) will legally require thename and personal information of people withcertain infectious diseases or symptoms and/ortheir contacts. These diseases are called\"reportable diseases\" in the Health Protection andPromotion Act (see page 8) and the informationgathered is needed to prevent further spread of aserious infection. Personal information can onlybe gathered and used in a restricted way and theidentity of the client(s) will not be released tostaff or other individuals at a shelter. * Some exceptions do apply. Consult with your agency's privacy policy on release of information. General Knowledge March 2006 | Toronto Public Health 19General Knowledge Public health emergencies In terms of infectious disease emergencies (e.g., SARS, pandemic influenza), homeless populations are a unique challenge. One must take into considerationthat groups of people may be living together and sharing kitchen or washroomfacilities and that it may not be easy to provide isolation or quarantine, totrack contacts and to watch staff and residents for signs of illness. These arethe types of challenges to think of when planning for public healthemergencies. Toronto Public Health does not work alone. Planning is ongoing and preparations are made in cooperation with such agencies as police, fireservices, Emergency Medical Services, hospitals, Shelter, Support and HousingAdministration, community agencies, etc. As well, the City of Toronto worksvery closely with both federal and provincial governments to make sureeveryone is prepared to respond.

Routine practicesDisinfecting solutions and fluid clean-upsSexually transmitted infectionsRespiratory symptomsGastrointestinal symptomsResources suppliesFood safetyNeedle reduction Infection ControlInfection ControlWhat is infection control? Infection control involves the education, preparation and actions that are taken by all to prevent the spread of infectious organisms within a communityor group of people. By reading this manual and attending a training sessionyou are taking the first major step in infection control. But preparing yourselfwith proper supplies and procedures is also important should an infectionoccur in your work setting. Below is a snap shot of some important points covered in more detail in other sections of this manual. These points are both an important part of day-to-daypractices to prevent infections, and are also important in controlling thespread of infections once an infection occurs. Environmental hygiene Make sure that your facility is adequately and regularly cleaned and sanitized using the properprocedures and solutions (see page 30). This isespecially important in shared areas such asdining rooms and bathrooms. Personal hygiene for clients Make sure that clients regularly wash their handsand bathe/shower or are referred to locationswhere they can bathe/shower. Make sure there isan adequate supply of soap, toilet paper, handsanitizer, paper towels, toothpaste, toothbrushes,razors, feminine napkins and tampons. Barriers Make sure staff and clients have access toappropriate barriers (e.g., gloves) if needed. Onebasic barrier that can be very effective is tissues.Make sure tissues are available and encouragepeople to cover their nose and mouth whencoughing or sneezing. Remind them to wash theirhands afterwards!Access to healthcare It is important that sick people (beyond everydaycoughs and colds) see a healthcare professionalearly on. Make sure that your clients areencouraged to seek medical attention whenneeded and be prepared to offer assistance inmaking arrangements. Stay home if sick It is important for staff and volunteers who aresick to stay home and not go to work. While minorcolds and illnesses may not physically stop youfrom working, simple infections can be veryserious for the people who stay in shelters or usehomeless services.Infection Control March 2006 | Toronto Public Health 23Infection Control Routine practices Overview Routine practices are a set of infection control precautions that should be used with all clientsregardless of whether they have an infection. Thepurpose of routine practices is to prevent thetransmission of germs. Routine practices include: hand washing barrier precautions cleaning personal hygiene and other specific activities Routine practices are based on the idea that we treat every person as if they are infected with anorganism. Simply put, if we treat everyone as if they have an infection, and protect ourselves,then the chances that we will be accidentallyexposed to an organism are smaller. Thesepractices reduce the risk of exposing others toinfections.You may be familiar with the terms \"universal precautions\", \"blood-borne precautions\" or\"additional precautions\". Routine practices is anew term, which makes sure that we all use theseprecautions routinely. Healthcare professionals and frontline care providers have adopted this principle around theworld. It is a simple idea, but when used regularlyand properly the results are impressive! This section on prevention includes some very practical steps that you can take to reduce therisk of infection to both yourself and your clients.Most of this information is common sense, butstill very effective. 24 Toronto Public Health | March 2006 Hand washing Regularly washing your hands is one of the most effective tools in stopping the spread of infection! The \"When\" of hand washing: 1. Upon entering and leaving your workplace , wash your hands thoroughly for 15 seconds . 2. Wash your hands frequently throughout the day for at least 15 seconds , with attention to the following situations: After having physical contact with a person, their bodily fluids or belongings Before and after having contact with food (including breastfeeding) Before and after wearing gloves When your hands are otherwise dirty After using the toilet After blowing your nose Before and after smoking cigarettes After changing a diaper The \"How\" of hand washing Start by wetting your wrists and hands before adding soap. Then add enough soap to get a good lather when you rub your hands together.Make sure you scrub your palms, as well as theoften missed areas such as in between fingers and the thumb. Rinse your hands until the soaplather is gone. Dry your hands first using a cloth or paper towel then use the cloth or paper towelto turn off the water taps so that you are not re-contaminating your clean hands. See Appendix 1 (page 103) for hand washing instructions Hand washing should be encouraged with your clients using the above \"when\" and \"how\" principles.Questions and Answers What kind of soap is the right kind of soap? Most of the time regular soap is your best bet for daily washing. For hygienic reasons we recommend liquid soap. If a bar of soap is used, its better that people don't share. The scrubbing action will remove most germs from your hands. What about liquid hand sanitizers? Liquid hand sanitizers are very effective in killing most germs and can be handy when soap and water are not available. However, if there is dirt/debris on the hand it must be washed off with soap and water. If you are not able to access running water and soap (i.e. when doing outreach) \"wash\" your hands with a moist hand-wipe.

By physically blockingthe germ from getting to you or others, the risk ofinfection is avoided. Some examples of barriersinclude tissues, gloves and masks. Tissues should be used to cover the nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing. Hands shouldbe washed immediately after using a tissue. In ashelter it is especially important that clients bereminded to do this by frontline staff and throughthe use of posted signs. Gloves should be used whenever physical contact is expected with any bodily fluid (e.g., saliva,blood, mucous, feces). The Public Health Agencyof Canada recommends using disposable medicalgloves made of the following: rubber, vinyl, nitrile,neoprene or latex. It is important to be aware thatsome people may be allergic to latex. Remember to wash your hands before and after using protective gloves. Do not re-use disposablegloves. They should be used one time only andthen thrown out. Make sure you receive training onthe proper way to remove gloves that have been incontact with body fluids. Masks should be used by clients who you think may have TB (see Appendix 3, pages 105 - 106),until they can be seen by a healthcareprofessional. A regular surgical mask on someonewho is coughing will help prevent infectiousdroplets from getting into the air. An \"N95\" mask should be used by designated staff when giving direct support to someone whoyou think may have active TB disease. N95 maskshave to be fit-tested ahead of time specifically forthe person who will be wearing them. Read themanufacturer's guidelines for more information. All masks should be replaced if they become soaked through, and disposed of after each use.They should never be re-used. Wash your handsafter handling a mask. Protective clothing should be used in situations where direct contact with body fluids (e.g., vomit, blood and stool/poop) is likely to occur . Protective clothing can take the form of a gown, apron oreven a separate set of work clothes (e.g., clothesworn only at work and then taken home in a bag atthe end of each shift). Contaminated clothingshould be laundered separately. Remember to be careful when removing barriers (gloves, masks, protective clothing) that may havebeen contaminated with body fluids. Make sureyou do not splash the fluids around or on yourselfwhen taking the barriers off.

This is very important within a shelteror drop-in. It is often challenging for homelesspeople to maintain good personal hygiene, and itis important that the facility be cleaned even morethoroughly. Particular attention should be paid tothe cleaning of bodily fluids (see page 30).Remember to thoroughly clean areas that aretouched regularly by a lot of people including doorknobs/handles, window latches, taps in bathroomsinks, light switches, telephones and handles ontoilets. Specific attention should be given to how individual pieces of furniture will be cleaned.Ideally, shared surfaces should be cleaned with adiluted bleach solution (see page 30). While thisis not possible with most cloth or fabric, it isrecommended that contaminated upholsteredfurniture be cleaned thoroughly to remove as muchdebris as possible and then shampooed afterwards.Mattresses should be enclosed in plastic covers, asshould pillowcases. Furniture such as tables andchairs used for eating should be cleaned with adiluted bleach solution after every meal. Medical gloves should never be used when handling cleaning chemicals. For environmentalcleaning and disinfecting, general purposereusable rubber gloves are appropriate. Garbage disposal Discard all contaminated disposable material (e.g.,paper towels) in a sealable plastic bag. Make surewhen disposing of garbage, you do not reach intothe bag or step on it with your feet. Bags shouldnever be too full, but if a bag is overflowing, use atool (e.g., tongs) to empty excess garbage into asecond bag. Never use your hands! Sharps disposal Used syringes, needles and razors should becarefully thrown out in a designated sharpsdisposal container made of puncture resistant,unbreakable material (see Appendix 4, page 107for requirements of an adequate sharps container).Most shelters should have a contract with a sharpsdisposal company. If not, consult the Yellow Pagesunder waste management or hospital equipmentand supplies for an appropriate sharps disposalcompany. More information Toronto Public Health The Works: 416-392-0520Routine practices Infection Control March 2006 | Toronto Public Health 27 Infection Control Routine practices Personal hygiene Shelter staff should encourage clients to maintain good personal hygiene. Making sure that there isan adequate supply of the following products at alltimes can support this: soap toilet paper hand sanitizer paper towels razors feminine napkins/tampons toothbrushes and toothpaste For their own protection, clients should be strongly discouraged from sharing washcloths, toothbrushesand razors.Questions and Answers Why is it necessary to wash my hands before using gloves? Rubber gloves are an effective barrier but accidents can happen. It is important that hands be clean to prevent contamination should the gloves tear. Also, some germs grow extremely well inside gloves. Washing hands before gloves are put on and after they are taken off reduces the number of germs, protecting both you and your client. What about the flu and TB...is a tissue really enough? Although covering the mouth during a cough or sneeze can reduce the risk of germ transmission, it does not eliminate the risk for all infections. If there is a concern about an infectious organism that can be transmitted through the air, staff can put a surgical mask on the client and take steps to separate him/her (e.g., offering a separate room) from the other clients, until a medical assessment has been completed. If you are concerned that someone has active TB disease (see Chapter 5), it is important that he/she wear a surgical mask when around other people, until they can be seen by a healthcare professional. 28 Toronto Public Health | March 2006 Body fluid exposures (including needle-stick injuries) There may be a number of situations where frontline workers might come in contact with bodyfluids. Some people may throw up, others mayaccidentally cut themselves. It is important toknow how to respond if this happens. Should you be pricked by a dirty needle or splashed with body fluids in your eyes, nose ormouth, or through an open cut on your skin, followthese steps: Needle-stick injuries (accidentally being stabbed with a hypodermic needle) 1. Let the wound bleed. 2. Flush the area with water or wash with soap and water. If the skin has been broken, applya topical antiseptic solution (e.g., isopropylalcohol, iodine). 3. Do not apply disinfectants to the eyes, nose or mouth. 4. Bandage the wound.5. Seek immediate medical attention at the hospital emergency department. Injuries with body-fluid exposures (exposure with broken skin) 1. Flush the area with water or wash with soap and water. 2. If there is excessive bleeding, apply pressure to stop the bleeding. 3. Apply a topical antiseptic solution (e.g., isopropyl alcohol, iodine). Do not applydisinfectants to the eyes, nose or mouth. 4. Bandage the wound.5. Seek immediate medical attention at the emergency department.Body fluid exposures to the eyes, nose or mouth 1. Flush the area with large amounts of water. 2. Seek follow up medical care or emergency care if necessary. Coming into contact with body fluids (intact skin) 1. Thoroughly wash hands and exposed skin following the same procedures for hand washing (see Appendix 1, page 103). Routine practices Infection Control March 2006 | Toronto Public Health 29 Infection Control Disinfecting solutions and body fluid clean-ups Bleach disinfecting solutions For cleaning-up surfaces where there are bodily fluids or other contamination (not skin) Mix nine equal parts of water with One part bleach (be careful not to spill on your skin) For general disinfecting of surfaces (not skin) Mix 99 equal parts of water with one part bleach This is about one teaspoon of bleach to two cups of water (be careful not to spill on your skin) Procedure for cleaning up of body fluids 1) Make sure that the area where the body fluid spill has occurred is blocked off. 2) Wash hands for at least 15 seconds using soap and water. 3) Put on disposable rubber gloves specific for cleaning. Latex gloves should not be worn as they are not designed for withstanding cleaning solutions. 4) Wipe up the spill using disposable paper towels, then place paper towels in a garbage bag. 5) Clean area using soap and water or a detergent solution. Rinse and dry the area with disposable paper towels. 6) Pour the bleach disinfecting solution (see above) onto all contaminated areas (be careful not to spill on your skin or clothing). 7) Let the area air dry for 20 minutes. 8) Any mops or non-disposable materials should be soaked in the bleach solution and air dried. 9) Remove gloves and place in the garbage bag. Double bag and secure the garbage bag before throwing out. 10) Wash hands for at least 15 seconds using soap and water. 30 Toronto Public Health | March 2006 Infection Control March 2006 | Toronto Public Health 31Sexually transmitted infections There are many infections (e.g., gonorrhoea, herpes, syphilis) that can be transmitted from one person to another through sexual contact. Some of these infections can be transmitted through exchanging bodily fluids such assemen, saliva and vaginal secretions. This can happen through anal, oral orvaginal sex. Other infections can be spread through direct bodily contact (i.e. skin to skin) with an infectedarea. Some sexually transmitted infections havevery obvious signs and symptoms while others mayhave no symptoms at all. As well, some sexuallytransmitted infections can be very serious,sometimes life-threatening. It is important to remember that people are sexual and to provide education and resources so thatsex can be a healthy part of life. Make sure yourclients have access to resources for safer sex.These resources can include: Condoms (both male and female) Educational pamphlets Access to sexual healthcare providers and testing centres Access to sexual health information centres/numbersA number of information sheets are available on specific sexually transmitted infections in Chapter 6. Also, Toronto Public Health can assistyou in providing some resources to your clientsthrough the Sexual Health Program. More information Toronto Public Health Sexual Health InfoLine:416-392-2437 Appendix 6, pages 110-111 for a list of Sexual Health ClinicsInfection Control Respiratory symptoms If you notice a higher than normal number of people (staff, volunteers and/or clients) with any of the following symptoms: sneezing coughing runny nose watery eyes wheezing shortness of breath difficulty breathing fever it is possible that you have a respiratory germ circulating in your facility. First steps An ambulance should always be called for any VERY sick person! Encourage hand washing/sanitizing and the use of tissues to cover the mouth and nose when people sneeze or cough. Staff who are showing signs of sickness should not be working.Clients/residents who are ill should be separated from other clients as much as possible. Begin to use the Illness Surveillance Log (see Appendix 2, page 104). Provide barriers, as is necessary and appropriate, to staff that are to be in contact with sick residents/clients. Sick residents who cannot be separatedfrom the rest of the population should be provided with surgical masks, iftolerated. Second steps If your facility has healthcare professionals available, they should be contacted to assess any sick clients/residents. If your facility does not have healthcare professionals available, encourage clients/residents to seek medical attention. For those who are very sick orhaving problems breathing, an ambulance should be called fortransportation to a hospital emergency department (notify the 911dispatcher that the patient may be infectious). For those who are notseriously ill, try to arrange for them to see a community healthcareprofessional or go to a walk-in clinic. Third steps It is important that a healthcare professional assess any sickness. If they have any concerns about a patient, tests will be ordered to determine a diagnosis. The healthcare professional will report any diseases which are classified as \"reportable\" to Toronto Public Health (see page 8). If necessary, Toronto Public Health will launch its own investigation at whichpoint documents such as the Illness Surveillance Log (see Appendix 2,page 104) will be helpful. 32 Toronto Public Health | March 2006Gastrointestinal symptoms If you notice a higher than normal number of people (staff, volunteers and/or clients) with any of the following symptoms: diarrhea - abnormally frequent semi-solid to fluid feces (poop) vomiting cramping blood in the stool fever it is possible that you have a gastrointestinal germ in your facility. First steps An ambulance should always be called for any VERY sick person! Encourage hand washing/sanitizing. Staff who are showing signs of sickness should not be working.Clients/residents who are ill should be separated from other clients as much as possible. Begin to use the Illness Surveillance Log (see Appendix 2, page 104). Second steps If your facility has healthcare professionals available, they should be contacted to assess any ill clients/residents. If your facility does not have healthcare professionals available, encourage clients/residents to seek medical attention. For those who are very sick, anambulance should be called for transportation to a hospital emergencydepartment (notify the 911 dispatcher that the patient may be infectious).For those who are not seriously ill, try to arrange for them to see acommunity healthcare professional or to go to a walk-in clinic. Third steps Whenever an increase in the number of people with the above symptoms is seen, food would be considered as a possible cause. Make sure that food samples from the last 48 hours are refrigerated in sealable plastic bags.Contact Toronto Public Health for guidance: 416-392-7411. Begin enhanced cleaning with special attention to your bathroom facilities (see page 30 for cleaning solutions).Infection Control March 2006 | Toronto Public Health 33Infection Control Resources and supplies The following is a list of recommended supplies related to infection prevention, that every shelter or hostel should have on hand. First aid supplies Well maintained first aid kits are important for many reasons. To begin with, they are animportant safety measure for both staff andresidents. Secondly, having the right supplies atthe right time is an important step in preventingthe spread of infection. It is recommended that afirst aid kit be kept in an easily accessible andwell known location. In larger facilities, it is agood idea to have more than one first aid kit(e.g., one per floor). The following is a list ofrequired contents for most standard emergency first aid kits: scissors (1) blunt nose tweezers (1) 5 cm x 5 cm (2 inches x 2 inches) sterile gauze dressings (10) 10 cm x 10 cm (4 inches x 4 inches) sterile gauze dressings (5) 10 cm x 10 cm (4 inches x 4 inches) sterile non-adherent dressings (5) regular size plastic bandages (10) children's size plastic bandages (10) slings or triangular bandages (10) 8 cm (3 inches) gauze roll (1) roll of non-allergenic adhesive tape (1) 8 cm (3 inches) elastic tensor bandage (1) safety pins (5) small bottle of skin antiseptic pocket first aid reference book (1) pairs of disposable latex gloves (2) incident records (1 set)Outbreak response kit In the event of a suspected or actual outbreak of an infectious disease it is important to have basicsupplies available for use. These supplies shouldbe readily accessible to staff. While the quantitywill vary from site to site, it is important thatfacilities have enough of the following supplies to last at least one weekend: box(es) of surgical masks box(es) of disposable rubber gloves in varying sizes at least one box of non-latex gloves package(s) of disposable gowns digital or disposable thermometers (digital with probe covers) extra bottles of hand sanitizer Illness Surveillance Log (see Appendix 2, page 104) 34 Toronto Public Health | March 2006Everyday infection prevention supplies It's a good idea to make sure the following items are well stocked and easily accessible in order tohelp control infections in your facility: Soap: Liquid soap is recommended. A bar of soap can be used as long as it is able to drainoff excess water (we do not recommend sharing the same bar of soap). Tissue: Having an adequate supply of tissue available throughout your facility andencouraging clients to cover their mouth andnose with the tissue when coughing orsneezing is a good infection control practice. Hand sanitizer: Liquid or foam hand sanitizer is available in pumps that can be easily fastenedto the wall. Having them available at theentrance to your facility and in key areas suchas the washroom is a good way to encouragehand hygiene. Disinfectant: Having a good disinfectant to sanitize surfaces (see page 30) is always agood practice. Condoms: Making condoms available to clients can help reduce the spread of sexually transmitted infections. Where to purchase supplies? While Toronto Public Health does not endorse any particular suppliers, we suggest you look in theYellow Pages under medical or surgical suppliesfor many of these items. Many pharmacies,especially those advertising \"Home Health CareSupplies\", also stock these supplies. N95 masks have to be fit-tested specifically for the person who will be wearing them. If you do nothave an occupational health service available toyou for advice on how to get this done, ask yoursupplier (pharmacies will not be able to arrange fittesting), or Toronto Public Health - TB program: 416-392-7420. Only one staff member per shiftneeds to be fit-tested for an N95 mask (e.g., theshift supervisors). (see page 26)Resources and supplies Infection Control March 2006 | Toronto Public Health 35 Infection Control Food safety Safe food handling It is important that food served to large groups of people is prepared and stored according to safefood handling practices outlined in the Ontariofood premises regulation. Ideally, there should also be a list of ingredients available in case of allergies. It is important thatfood remain at safe temperatures throughout thefood preparation process, serving and storage.There should be designated servers and hand-washing facilities for staff, volunteers and clients.Safe food temperatures: Keep cold foods below 4 \u00b0C. Keep hot foods above 60 \u00b0C. Food in holding trays must be kept at 60 \u00b0C or above. Toronto Public Health offers food handling advice and education. Contact the number listed belowfor more information. Questions and answers Why is it necessary to keep food in holding trays at ahigher temperature than hot foods that are beingserved directly from the kitchen? Food that sits in holding trays over a period of time is more likely to cool down and growdangerous bacteria. It must be kept at 60\u00b0C orhigher to make sure that the temperature of thefood does not fall into the \"danger zone\" wherebacteria grow quickly.

It is important to reduce the risk of infectious diseases, such as HIVand hepatitis C, by making drug use as safe as possible. Toronto Public Healthoperates a program called The Works, which provides a number of harmreduction and health promotion services targeted specifically to drug users andsex trade workers. You can refer your clients to this program if you think theymight benefit from the services offered. The Works program is FREE! The Works seeks to reduce the spread of infection by providing: free clean needles education about safe injection and safer sex collection and safe disposal of used needles condoms testing for HIV, hepatitis and syphilis free hepatitis B vaccine free flu, pneumococcal and tetanus vaccines a methadone maintenance program on-the-street first aid basic medical care support to drug users who are HIV-positive referrals to detox, drug treatment and other servicesThe Works Where: 277 Victoria St. (Dundas at Victoria St.) When: Monday to Friday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. The Van on the street: Monday to Saturday, 6:30 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. (some of the same services as the clinic) There are also a number of agencies that have contracts with Toronto Public Health to provideneedle exchange services throughout the city. For a detailed list, see Appendix 7, pages 112 - 113. Clients who wish to stop using drugs should be referred to treatment programs.

Preparing for an outbreak Identifying outbreaksOutbreak identification process Managing and controlling an outbreak Outbreak Management Checklist OutbreaksOutbreaksWhat is an outbreak? The word \"outbreak\" is used whenever there is a local (e.g., household, school) increase in the number of people with a particular disease or infection.Outbreaks can happen in homes, communities, workplaces, shelters or anentire city; wherever people interact, work or live. Outbreaks can be minor or very serious depending on the kind of infection and the group of peoplewho are infected. For example, an outbreak of thecommon cold might not be very serious in a highschool, but in a nursing home or hospital, it couldhave more serious results. There are four important ways in which frontline workers can work together with Toronto PublicHealth to prevent illness due to outbreaks. These are: 1. Preventing outbreaks from happening 2. Preparing for an outbreak3. Identifying outbreaks as quickly as possible4. Managing and controlling outbreaksPreventing outbreaks One of the most important jobs of Toronto Public Health is to prevent the spread of infections in thecommunity. This is done by educating peopleabout good infection control practices and byhelping them maintain a safe environment whichprevents the spread of disease. By following theguidelines in this manual you will reduce thechances of infections spreading in your shelterand reduce the chances of an outbreak.Outbreaks March 2006 | Toronto Public Health 41Outbreaks Preparing for an outbreak Preparation will help make sure that an outbreak is dealt with in the best possible way. Good preparation involves making sure that the facility isprepared and that staff know what to do in case of an outbreak. For a large institution this might mean having an emergency or outbreak plan. At a minimum, facilities should make sure they have adequate supplies of the cleaning and hygiene products that are referred to in this manual (see page 34). Infection Control Team One of the most important parts of dealing with an outbreak is good communication betweenpeople in different jobs in your facility andbetween your facility and Toronto Public Health. Many facilities have a Health and Safety Committee that makes sure the workplace is a healthy andsafe place to work. Agencies might want toconsider organizing an Infection Control Team as a part of the Health and Safety Committee. You should consider having representatives from the following areas (where possible) on yourInfection Control Team : Housekeeping Healthcare Food services Administration Client support staff/activities co-ordination Toronto Public Health recommends that you establish an Infection Control Team well in advanceof an outbreak . However, even if your facility decides to establish a team only after an outbreakhas been declared, it is worthwhile maintaining anup-to-date list of who you need to have on theteam. The team may become your Outbreak Management Team and coordinate the response to the outbreak, follow Toronto Public Health'sadvice and gather information from the differentparts of the facility. Outbreak Coordinator In order to make sure that the outbreakinvestigation is well coordinated and that there isgood communication with Toronto Public Health,it is recommended that your agency have anOutbreak Coordinator . The Outbreak Coordinator would: Act as the lead person for this infection control manual in your agency. Be part of the infection control team and make sure the team meets regularly. Be responsible for liaising with Toronto Public Health on infection control issues. Be responsible for implementing your agency's specific emergency plans for outbreaks. As with the Infection Control Team you may wish to appoint an Outbreak Coordinator prior to any outbreak happening so that the person can receive training and start planning. 42 Toronto Public Health | March 2006Identifying outbreaks An outbreak occurs when there is more than the usual or more than the expected number of cases of disease infection in a particular setting or group.How does Toronto Public Health know what is the usual number of cases? Howdo you know if your facility is having an unusual amount of a particulardisease? The answer is surveillance . Surveillance and reporting Surveillance is the ongoing regular collection and analysis of health information. Toronto PublicHealth does surveillance for infectious diseases bycollecting reports of disease from healthcareprofessionals and laboratories. Toronto PublicHealth has been collecting information for manyyears and this is how it knows the usual numberof diseases in different parts of the City or indifferent settings. There are certain diseases that are \"reportable\" to Toronto Public Health . This means healthcare professionals, hospitals and laboratories arerequired, by provincial law, to report thesediseases to the local Public Health Unit. Sometypes of infections are considered high risk andthe law requires that these be reported andinvestigated immediately (see page 8). While, shelters and hostels are NOT legally required to report any diseases to Public Health,there are ways in which people who work inshelters can help to identify an outbreak as earlyas possible. Some shelters ask health questions at intake to make sure those clients who are sick get propermedical care and do not spread infections in theshelter or hostel. Some shelters also haveorganized programs to make sure clients who havesymptoms, like a cough or fever, are asked morequestions about their health and are helped tofind appropriate care. Illness Surveillance Log Even if your shelter or hostel does not have aprogram like this, you can help identify anoutbreak by keeping a record of clients or groupsof clients who have symptoms of illness, or reportcases of illness to your supervisor. A sampleIllness Surveillance Log is included (see Appendix 2, page 104) to help your organization record thisinformation. By being aware of clients who are ill, you may be better able to identify when there is anunexpected amount of illness in your facility. Eventhough shelter workers are not required to reportdiseases, you may want to call Toronto PublicHealth if you notice an increase in the number ofill clients or an increase in the severity of illness.A Toronto Public Health investigator will help youdecide if any further investigation is needed. This investigation might include simple questions about what you have noticed: Who is sick? What are the signs and symptoms? Have they seen a healthcare professional? If so, what was the diagnosis or cause of the illness? How many people are sick? How sick are they? Are they being treated? Toronto Public Health may advise you about further steps to take which may include sendingthe client for medical care and possible laboratorytesting. You should also be aware that testing forinfections is voluntary and cannot be forced,except in rare conditions specifically ordered bythe Medical Officer of Health or designate.Outbreaks March 2006 | Toronto Public Health 43Outbreaks Outbreak identification process All staff and volunteers should be aware of the possibility of an outbreak when a number of clients, workers or volunteers report an illness with similarsymptoms. If a change in health patterns (e.g., more than the expectednumber of clients, staff or volunteers with diarrhea, coughs, rashes, etc.) is noticed, a healthcare professional should be consulted for guidance. Follow this process if you suspect a communicable disease outbreak in your facility: An increase in the number of clients, staff or volunteers with similar healthcomplaints ( e.g., vomiting, diarrhea, rashes, coughing, etc. ). STEP #1 Arrange for sick clients, staff or volunteers to seek medical attention. Inform the healthcare professional doing assessments that there are anumber of people with similar symptoms in the same facility.( Note: the facility should help clients to access medical attention ) Are there a large number of people with similar complaints of sickness? (i.e. more than you would normally expect for your facility ) Note: All outbreaks of vomiting and diarrhea should be reported to Toronto Public Health to assess for a possible food source. 44 Toronto Public Health | March 2006STEP #2 Contact Toronto Public Healthfor guidance: 416-392-7411 (after hours emergencies: 416-690-2142)YES NO STEP #2 Wait for diagnosis and direction from ahealthcare professional. Continue tomonitor clients, staff or volunteers for anything out of the ordinary. If concerned, contact Toronto PublicHealth for guidance: 416-392-7411 (see Chapter 2)Managing and controlling an outbreak: 11 Steps The following are some of the most important steps in managing an outbreak. Toronto Public Health will take the lead with most of these tasks but will needhelp from your facility. 1. Declaring an outbreak Toronto Public Health will declare an outbreak based on the evidence that it has gathered fromthe facility, hospitals, laboratories and doctors. 2. Instituting environmental control measures Toronto Public Health will advise your institution on control measures to help stop the spread ofinfection. Many of these measures are infectioncontrol practices included in this manual. You willneed to make sure these steps are being rigorouslyfollowed to the best of your abilities. TorontoPublic Health may make other recommendationsfor environmental controls or assessments. 3. Establishing a case definition Toronto Public Health will use the information ithas gathered to develop a specific definition,which will determine who is a \"case\" and needs tobe included in the outbreak investigation. TorontoPublic Health may ask you to follow particularinstructions when dealing with people who meetthis case definition. 4. Setting up a monitoring and surveillance system Toronto Public Health may need your help in making sure that any ill clients who might be atrisk are identified and treated appropriately. Thismay involve screening your clients by askingsimple health questions or regularly watching forsymptoms in clients. Toronto Public Health willgive you specific instructions in order to dosurveillance if necessary.5. Setting up Outbreak Management Team meetings and appointing an OutbreakCoordinator It is important that there is effective and timely communication between different parts of yourfacility and between your organization and TorontoPublic Health. Toronto Public Health may help youset up an Outbreak Management Team and willattend all meetings of this team. Toronto PublicHealth will be in regular communication with yourfacility. Having an Outbreak Coordinator for yourfacility will help make sure this communication issmooth and rapid. Each organization, includingToronto Public Health, will designate aspokesperson to deal with media inquiries asappropriate. 6. Identifying cases of disease and ensuring appropriate diagnosis and treatment Toronto Public Health will give you information and instructions about how to deal with cases ofinfection which your staff identify. This mayinvolve sending clients to a healthcareprofessional or hospital. Toronto Public Healthmay also ask that you isolate or cohort theseindividuals from other clients and will discuss thedetails of how you would do this at your facility.Outbreaks March 2006 | Toronto Public Health 45Outbreaks Managaing and controllling an outbreak 7. Identifying contacts and people at risk As part of its investigation Toronto Public Health will need to assess people who may have beenexposed to the infection (contacts) and otherpeople who might be at risk of becoming ill.Toronto Public Health may need your help infinding out who these people are and how tocontact them. Toronto Public Health may need tospeak with them to provide information andinstructions. These instructions may includemedication, immunization, and cohorting ofcontacts or, more rarely, quarantine. TorontoPublic Health will discuss the details of thesemeasures with the Outbreak Management Team. 8. Taking further action to control the spread of an infection Toronto Public Health may need to take other actions in order to prevent further infection ordisease. This may involve providing educationalmaterials for your clients, providing certainvaccinations or medications or regularly testingclients for disease. Toronto Public Health willdiscuss these options with your institution in orderto efficiently implement these activities.9. Further investigation by Toronto Public Health The investigation may continue over a long period of time. Toronto Public Health may ask yourfacility for more information or action at anytimeduring this investigation. 10. Declaring the outbreak over The criteria for declaring an outbreak over can bevery different for each type of disease. Anoutbreak may last for several days, several weeksor even years. Toronto Public Health will declarethe outbreak over when the threat to the health ofthe public has been minimized and there is noevidence that the infection is still being spread. 11. Communicating the findings and instituting future prevention measures There is much to be learned from each outbreak experience. When an outbreak is over orsometimes even before it is over, Toronto PublicHealth may have specific recommendations inorder to prevent future outbreaks. Toronto PublicHealth may communicate its findings andrecommendations in writing and may work withyour facility to implement the appropriatechanges. 46 Toronto Public Health | March 2006During an outbreak it is sometimes necessary for Toronto Public Health to take strong steps to stop the spread of infection. This will involve the separation ofhealthy, sick and potentially exposed people. Cohorting This is one way that sick people can be separated from healthy people. If Toronto Public Health feelsthis is necessary, it will suggest that all peoplewho are ill with the same infection be housedtogether within the same area or bemonitored/managed by the same staff. Isolation Similar to cohorting, isolation is a more drasticstep. This involves the strict separation of sickpeople from healthy people and the use of specialrooms, equipment, etc. to make sure thatinfectious organisms are not spread. Usuallyisolation is a technique that is used in hospitalsettings. Quarantine Quarantine is a rare step taken by Public Healthauthorities which requires healthy people who mayhave been exposed to a serious infection toremain separated from everyone else. There will be challenges in using any of these techniques within homeless service settings andwith homeless clients. Each situation will beevaluated on a case-by-case basis to determinewhat steps are the most appropriate. If TorontoPublic Health decides that it is necessary to takesteps such as those above, it will be important tohave close discussions with the facilities involved.Questions and Answers What about residents/clients who are refusing assessment and/or treatment and might be infecting other people? Toronto Public Health will work with your staff to assess situations and assist you with resolving potential problems. The Medical Officer of Health or designate has certain powers which may be used if necessary in very specific circumstances that pose a threat to the health of the public. What if isolation, cohorting or quarantine is not possible in my facility? Public Health officials will work closely with the Outbreak Management Team for your facility to identify what steps are possible. Special accommodations will be arranged in certain circumstances if necessary. On occasion, Toronto Public Health may request or direct a shelter to stop or restrict admissions to their facility. What about transporting sick residents/clients to healthcare professionals? An ambulance should be called for any clients who are very sick and when other means of transportation are not possible. If a personal vehicle or taxi is transporting a client, care should be taken to make sure that the infection is not spread (i.e. hand washing before getting into the car, use of tissues). If possible, a staff person should accompany the sick individual being transported. For clients with respiratory symptoms, staff should read the section on barrier protection (see page 26).

Initiate control measures and make sure that they are enforced(i.e. enhanced environmental sanitation in high traffic areas, bathrooms, handrails, tables, door knobs). Reinforce routine precautions (e.g., hand washing, barrier use if appropriate, hand sanitizer). Establish Outbreak Management Team and set time for first meeting. Appoint an Outbreak Coordinator. Communicate information to staff and other institutions. Increase surveillance. 48 Toronto Public Health | March 2006Chapter 4 Workplace health and immunizations Environmental recommendationsOutreach healthWorkplace Health Workplace HealthWorkplace health and immunizations When working with homeless people, staff may encounter a range of illnesses. While we cannot totally eliminate the chance of catching something, we canreduce the risks of getting an infection. It is the responsibility of theemployer and employee together to reduce the risk of exposure and ofinfection. All agencies should make themselves aware of their obligations under the Occupational Health and Safety Act. Some organizations will have anoccupational health department that will actively monitor the environment inwhich emp loyees are w orking. The following are some specific considerations for workplace health and safety, infectious diseases and homeless clients. Make sure: There are adequate supplies for personal hygiene at all times (e.g., soap, sanitizer,hand towels, running water, toothpaste,brushes, tampons, etc.). Basic personal protective equipment (e.g., gloves, masks, etc.) is available to allstaff and volunteers and that they know howto use it properly. All staff and volunteers have training in infection prevention and control on a regular basis. There is an established way for management to communicate concerns to staff and for staff to communicate concerns to management. Emergency supplies (e.g., first aid kit, outbreak response kit) are accessible and appropriately stocked. That used syringes, needles and razors are carefully thrown out in a designated sharpsdisposal container (see Appendix 4, page107). Workplace Health and Environmental Safety March 2006 | Toronto Public Health 51Workplace Health and Environmental Safety Workplace health and immunizations Immunizations Working with people from all walks of life requires that you take all necessary precautions to protectyour health. One effective way to protect yourselfis to make sure your immunizations are up-to-date. There are routine vaccines that all adults should have and there are other vaccines that arerecommended for shelter workers, if they areconsidered to be at increased risk of exposure. Youshould discuss this with your own healthcareprofessional. Those who work in shelters should refer to the Toronto Shelter Standards. The following is a list of routine immunizations that ALL adults should receive (unless there is amedical reason why they cannot). Everyone shouldknow his/her immunization status and take stepsto get any vaccinations that are overdue. Diphtheria-Tetanus vaccine: One primary series (usually given at childhood) and then boostersevery 10 years. Measles-Mumps-Rubella vaccine: Usually this is given in childhood, and is now given in two doses.Individuals who did not attend school in Canada(e.g., immigrants/refugees) may not have receivedone or more of the vaccine components, such asrubella. If you are not sure about your status, youcan be tested. Starting the series over again orhaving one booster should be discussed with yourhealthcare professional. Hepatitis B vaccine: Hepatitis B is a common virus that attacks the liver but is preventable throughimmunization (usually two or three doses). Anyonewho works in the shelter system and who might beat risk of a needle stick injury is stronglyencouraged to be vaccinated against hepatitis B(see Information Sheet, page 80).Hepatitis A vaccine: Hepatitis A is a virus that attacks the liver. It is passed in the stool (poop)from people who are infected. The hepatitis Avaccine is available free of charge to: men whohave sex with men; drug users; people withchronic liver disease such as hepatitis B or C andhousehold or sexual contacts of a person withhepatitis A (see Information Sheet, page 79). Askyour healthcare professional for more informationor call Toronto Public Health: 416-338-7600. Chickenpox vaccine: Many adults who grew up in Canada have already had chickenpox and would beconsidered immune (protected). If you have aclear history of chickenpox as a child, then you arelikely immune. If there is any doubt, ask yourhealthcare professional to test your blood to see ifyou are immune or not. If you are not protected,then it is highly recommended that you getimmunized against chickenpox. Chickenpox is verycommon in shelters that have children or families.If you are exposed and not protected you may berequired to miss some time from work. If you getchickenpox as an adult, it can be very severe (seeInformation Sheet, page 73). Influenza vaccine: It is highly recommended that individuals who work/volunteer in a shelter gettheir influenza vaccination every year (seeInformation Sheet, page 84). TB surveillance TB skin testing: All staff and volunteers, who spend regular ongoing time (an average of eight hours amonth or more) in a drop-in or shelter in Toronto,should have TB skin testing done (see Chapter 5,page 59). More information Appendix 9, pages 114 -115 Toronto Public Health Immunization Hotline: 416-392-1250 Toronto Public Health - TB Program: 416-392-7420 Section 8.1 of the Toronto Shelter Standards 52 Toronto Public Health | March 2006Environmental recommendations Sleeping space recommendations To decrease the potential spread of illness it is important to provide a minimum space per person in sleeping areas. The City of Toronto has established the following two standards for use in all shelterfacilities funded by the City. They are good standards for all institutions providing shelter to follow. The minimum required for a person's sleeping space, as per Shelter Standards, should be no less than: 3.5 square metres (37.7 square feet/person) The minimum distance between beds, as per ShelterStandards, should be no less than: 75 centimetres (2.5 feet) Additionally, it is recommended that beds be arranged so that clients sleep in a foot-to-head fashion so as to further distance people from one another. Ventilation recommendations In order to improve air quality and have a supplyof fresh (e.g., non-contaminated) air, rooms in ashelter should be well ventilated. Many Torontoshelters have HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and AirConditioning) systems. Make sure that your facility's air handling system is regularly serviced and maintained so that it isworking properly. Check the manufacturer'sguidelines to establish your maintenanceschedule. Make sure fresh air intake vents areopen, ducts are not blocked off and filters arecleaned. If you have an HVAC system make surethe fan is on continuously even if the heat/airconditioner is off. Smaller facilities without an HVAC system may be able to improve ventilation by opening windows(weather permitting) on both sides of a room toget a cross-draft. Portable fans can also be usedto help create a more forceful draft as long asthere is both a way for fresh air to enter and staleair to leave.Personal belongings Many infestations (e.g., scabies, bedbugs) cantravel on the belongings of individuals. One way toprevent the spread of such organisms is throughthe plastic bagging of personal belongings. Alsodiscourage as much as possible, the sharing ofpersonal items such as hats, scarves, coats,combs and brushes. Diaper tables Separate designated tables should be provided fordiaper changes of babies and young children.These tables should ONLY be used for thisfunction and should be cleaned with adisinfecting solution after every use (see page 30). More information Section 6.1 of the Toronto Shelter StandardsWorkplace Health and Environmental Safety March 2006 | Toronto Public Health 53Workplace Health and Environmental Safety Outreach health When involved in outreach activities, access to running water and hygiene supplies may be difficult. The following are special suggestions for peopleinvolved in outreach activities. Hand washing When running water is not available, advance planning is important. Before you begin anyoutreach activities make sure you have thesupplies you need and enough of them. The firstgoal of hand washing is to remove dirt or debrisfrom your hands. This can be accomplishedthrough friction. A disposable moist (preferablyalcohol-soaked) hand-wipe (the type some fastfood restaurants carry) can be used to removesuch dirt and debris. Follow these key points when using a hand-wipe: Make sure the hand-wipe is clean. Generate enough friction to remove dirt/debris, particularly around the nail beds and inbetween fingers. Once most of the dirt/debris has been removed, use an additional clean hand-wipeto make sure hands are clean. Make sure you also sanitize or use alcohol- soaked hand-wipes to clean your hands. Using a hand-wipe is not as effective as hand washing. This technique should only be usedwhen running water is not available. Always wash your hands before and after an outreach activity. Every outreach worker should carry a personal supply of hand sanitizer. They are available atmost drug stores and shops that carry personalhygiene supplies. You should always sanitize yourhands before and after you have direct contactwith an outreach client or their belongings tomake sure you are not passing germs to them orcatching germs from them.To use a hand sanitizer: Squeeze a small amount on the palm of your hand. Rub the sanitizer intoyour hand and make sure to get in between yourfingers and all around your nails. Keep rubbinguntil the sanitizer has dried (see Appendix 1, page 103). Outreach kit The following is a minimum list of supplies thatshould be carried by every worker during outreachactivities: two pairs of disposable rubber gloves for every outreach worker one pair of non-latex gloves for every outreach worker two surgical masks one bottle of personal hand sanitizer or 10 moist alcohol-soaked hand-wipes 10 moist hand-wipes two re-sealable plastic bags for contaminated garbage a water-resistant bag to carry supplies (e.g., plastic bag) These supplies are compact and can easily be transported in a backpack or carry bag. You willnotice that most supplies have expiry dates andcare should be taken to make sure expired itemsare not kept in the kit. Also, temperature extremes(hot or cold) and moisture (water) should beavoided as much as possible. 54 Toronto Public Health | March 2006Tuberculosis Chapter 5 TB infection vs. TB disease Information about TBTB skin testingActive TB diseaseTB risk factorsRole of Toronto Public Health in TB prevention and controlRecommended TB policy for homeless service agenciesQuestions and Answers TuberculosisTB infection vs. TB disease There is a big difference between TB infection and TB disease. It is important for you to know the difference. Positive TB skin test TB germ has entered the body but is not growing (latent) NOT CONTAGIOUS Cannot pass the TB germ to anyone else Normal chest x-ray No symptoms May be prescribed medication for nine monthsto prevent disease from developing Person is at risk of developing disease in the future/triangleleftSKIN has entered the body and is growing(replicating) CONTAGIOUS If disease is in the lungs/ throat and not properly treated with medication May have an abnormal chest x-ray OR evidence of TB in another part of the body Symptoms become more severe over time (e.g., newor worsening cough, chestpain, chills, weakness, fever,weight loss, night sweats,coughing up blood) Requires treatment with several medicines for atleast six months to cure disease Person has disease and must be treated to preventdisease from getting worseand spreading to othersTuberculosis March 2006 | Toronto Public Health 57Infection (inactive) OR Disease (active)Tuberculosis Information about tuberculosis (TB) What is TB? Tuberculosis (TB) is a communicable disease caused by the bacteria called Mycobacteriumtuberculosis. Pulmonary TB is active TB disease in the lungs and/or throat that can be spread toother people. Extra-pulmonary TB is active TB disease in another part of the body (e.g., lymph node,kidney, bone or joint, brain). This is usuallynot contagious. How do you get TB? You can catch TB by spending time in close quarters with someone who has activepulmonary TB disease. When the person withactive TB disease coughs, shouts, sings orsneezes, tiny germs will float in the air.People nearby can breathe the TB germs intotheir lungs and get TB infection. TB is not a highly infectious disease. Transmission usually requires close and frequent contact with someone who has activepulmonary TB disease. You cannot get TB from sharing clothes, bedding, drinks, cigarettes or dishes.What happens if you breathe in TB germs? TB germs enter your lungs. Your immune system fights the TB germs by building a wall around them. The wall stopsthe germs from growing in the lungs or anyother part of your body. If you have this, youhave TB infection or (inactive) TB and: you may never get sick you cannot pass the germs on to others How do you know if you have TB germs in your body? You can tell if you have TB infection (inactive) by having a TB skin test. 58 Toronto Public Health | March 2006TB skin testing What is the TB skin test? The TB skin test tells you if the TB germ is in your body. It is also called the Mantoux test ortuberculin skin test (TST). A nurse or doctor injects a small amount of clear fluid called \"tuberculin\" under the skinof your forearm. It will look like a mosquitobite. Two or three days later, the nurse or doctor examines your arm, measures thebump and tells you if the test result is positive or negative. The test is considered positive or negative depending on the size of the bump. You cannot catch TB from the TB skin test. Regular TB skin testing will not cause you to become positive later on. Even if you had a TB vaccine (BCG) in the past, you can still have the TB skin test. Youshould tell your healthcare professional if youhave had BCG. It is safe to have the TB skin test if you are pregnant.What does a positive TB skin test mean? If your skin test is \"positive\" it means you have TB germs in your body. You need a check-up by your doctor, a chest x-ray and sputum test to rule out active TBdisease. A positive skin test, normal chest x-ray, normal physical exam and negative sputumtest results mean you have TB infection (inac-tive). TB infection means your body has created a wall around the TB germs. If you are otherwise healthy, you have a five to 10 per cent chance of developing active TBdisease in the future. You may take medicine (e.g., Isoniazid for nine months) to greatly reduce your chance ofgetting active TB disease in the future. What does a negative TB skin test mean? If your TB skin test is \"negative\", it means the TB germs are not present or not showing in yourbody now. The germs may not be showing because people with a weakened immune systemcaused by diseases such as diabetes, HIV orcancer may not react to the skin test andshould be referred to a TB specialist or clinicfor further testing.Tuberculosis March 2006 | Toronto Public Health 59 Tuberculosis TB skin testing What is 2-step TB skin testing? 2-step TB skin testing is used only as the initial test for people who will be getting repeated TB skin tests The body's reaction to the TB skin test can decrease over time. A person who was infectedwith TB a long time ago may initially have anegative skin test. The test should be repeated(second step) in one to four weeks. If the second skin test is positive, this is caused bythe booster effect and it shows the person wasinfected some time in the past. It is important to know the true TB skin test results of those people who will be tested regularly. People who work in places wherethere is a greater risk of becoming infectedwith TB should be tested regularly (e.g., people who work in shelters, hospitals, jails or those who regularly travel to or live in countries where TB is common). See page 59and speak to your healthcare professional formore information. For those people whose current TB skin test is unknown, here is how 2-step skin testingworks: First TB skin test: If negative, you will have a second skin test. If positive, there is no need to have a second test. Second TB skin test: The second TB skin test should be done one to four weeks after the first negative test. The results of the second TB skin test are recorded as your true reaction. All future TBskin test reactions are compared to this result. It is important to keep a record of your TB skin test results. 60 Toronto Public Health | March 2006Active TB disease Can TB germs make you sick? When you have TB infection (inactive), the wall surrounding the TB germs can break down if yourimmune system is weakened because you are: ill with another disease, such as diabetes, cancer or HIV on steroid therapy stressed getting older underweight or malnourished If this happens, the germs begin to grow and spread (become active) and you have active TB disease. What are the symptoms of active TB disease? Cough - new or worsening, lasting more than three weeks Chest pain, shortness of breath, coughing up blood Unexplained weight loss Fatigue Loss of appetite Fever, chills, night sweats If the TB disease is in another part of the body, the symptoms will depend on where it islocated (e.g., enlarged lymph node, jointpain). If you have any of these signs or symptoms, you should see a doctor or nurse right away. The doctoror nurse may collect sputum, send you for a chestx-ray and do other tests for TB.Can TB disease be cured? TB disease can be cured with medicine (antibiotics). TB medicine is FREE. You will need to take four or five TB medicines (antibiotics) for at least six months. Your healthcare professional will decide when you are no longer contagious. The healthcareprofessional will check the sputum to makesure the TB disease is not contagious. It is important to take your medicine for as long as the doctor tells you to. Toronto Public Health staff will support you in taking your TB treatment (see page 63)Tuberculosis March 2006 | Toronto Public Health 61 Tuberculosis 62 Toronto Public Health | March 2006Every year in Toronto, approximately 370 - 400 people are diagnosed with TB disease. Approximately five per cent of these active TB cases are in thehomeless and under-housed population. An outbreak of TB was identified intwo downtown men's shelters in 2001 and 2004. Such outbreaks can take yearsto control. TB risk factors Some groups are at higher risk of having TB infection (inactive). They include: People who have had close and prolonged contact with people who have active TB of thelungs or throat. People who have lived or travelled where TB is common (Asia, Africa, South America,some parts of Eastern Europe). People who have lived on a reserve or in an Inuit community. People who have HIV/AIDS. Staff and residents of long-term care facili- ties, hospitals and correctional centres. Older people, especially those who have lived through times when TB was common. Staff and residents of shelters or agencies that work with homeless and under-housedpeople. Some groups who have TB infection (inactive) are at higher risk of developing active TB disease. They include: People with a history of active TB disease that has not been treated properly. People with an abnormal chest x-ray. People with medical problems that reduce their ability to fight infection (e.g. cancer, diabetes, organ transplantation,chronic kidney failure, HIV/AIDS).Why are homeless people at greater risk of TB? People who are homeless are at increased risk for both TB infection (inactive) and active TB diseasebecause some risk factors for TB are commonamong this group. These risk factors include: Contact with other homeless people who have untreated active TB disease. Poor access to nutritious food. Poor access to healthcare. Difficulty keeping medical appointments or completing TB drug treatment. Difficulty getting close follow-up by health- care professionals after exposure to TB. Increased likelihood of having chronic health conditions. Substance use, especially injection drug use and alcohol. Limited access to HIV education and prevention measures, increasing the risk ofHIV infection.Role of Toronto Public Health in TB prevention and control TB is a reportable disease. This means that every case of both active TB disease and TB infection (inactive) must be reported by a healthcareprofessional to Toronto Public Health. Management of Active TB disease The Public Health Nurse will do the following: Verify that the client has active TB disease or TB infection (inactive) Contact the physician/hospital/clinic for additional information Visit the client to: teach about active TB disease and how to prevent its spread discuss TB medicines and their side effects check that medicines are being taken properly encourage medical follow-up appointments identify contacts and refer them for follow-up refer clients with other health/social needs to other sources of help Assess the need for Directly Observed Therapy Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) It is a free program to help cure TB. A DOT worker regularly meets with the client to help them with his/her TB medicine. How does the DOT program work? A DOT worker will meet with the client: at home or another place (e.g., shelter or work) about five times a week until the treatment is finishedHow can the DOT worker help the client? A DOT worker will: support the client throughout the long TB treatment watch for side effects from the TB medicine help the client take the TB medicine correctly help the client to understand TB help the client with TB doctor appointments refer the client to appropriate agencies to address other concerns Contact tracing All people reported with active TB disease are assessed by Public Health to determine ifthey are contagious. The purpose of contact tracing is to identify, notify and educate anyone who has been inclose prolonged contact with someone whohas active TB disease, and to make sure thatthey are tested so they know if they have beeninfected and may need treatment. If someone is contagious with active TB disease in a shelter or drop-in, Public Healthwill educate, advise and follow-up with staff,volunteers and clients.Tuberculosis March 2006 | Toronto Public Health 63TB skin testing for staff and volunteers All staff and volunteers, who spend regular ongoing time (an average of eight hours a monthor more) in a drop-in or shelter in Toronto, shouldbe tested for TB. Initial testing TB testing should be done pre-employment, pre-volunteer or student placement. Initial testing should be 2-step TB skin testing. If a person has a positive TB skin test, a medical exam and chest x-ray will be required. The results of the TB skin test (doctor's note and chest x-ray results if needed) should bekept in a separate, confidential health file. If a person has a documented positive TB skin test in the past, repeated TB skin testing whenstarting work with homeless people is not nec-essary. The person should be aware of thesigns and symptoms of TB, and seek medicalfollow-up if these symptoms occur. NOTE: The purpose of TB skin testing at the start of work is to document current status; this makesmedical follow-up for staff much morestraightforward if they are exposed to someonewith infectious TB later on at work. A negative TB skin test should never be a requirement ofemployment!Annual follow-up Annual testing is recommended if the initial 2-step TB skin test is negative. However, thefollow up for a positive TB skin test includesseeing a doctor so active TB disease can be ruledout. There are no workplace or employmentrestrictions necessary for people who have apositive TB skin test. TB education Staff and volunteers should receive TB educationwithin 30 days of starting work. Regular TBupdates should be provided as needed. Symptom screening All staff who work directly with clients should be aware of the signs and symptoms of TB andmust know how to refer someone who is ill forassessment and follow-up. The TB symptomscreening form included in this manual (seeAppendix 3, pages 105-106) can be used toobtain information for assessment and referral. 64 Toronto Public Health | March 2006Recommended TB policy for homeless service agenciesTuberculosisEnvironmental and infection control measures The following environmental and infection control measures will help reduce the spread of TB: Instruct someone who is coughing or sneezing to cover their nose and mouth. Supply disposable tissue to the clients. Place each bed/cot as far from neighbouring beds/cots as possible in head-to-foot arrange-ments. Adequate ventilation and/or air circulation sys- tems may help reduce the risk of TB. Consultyour building engineer to make sure ventila-tion units are maintained regularly and operat-ing properly (e.g., intake vents are open). Make sure all staff and volunteers have had appropriate TB skin testing (see section 8.1 ofthe Toronto Shelter Standards). Make sure regular surgical masks are available to give to clients who have possible TB symp-toms. They should wear the masks until theycan be seen by a healthcare professional. Make sure that one staff member per shift (e.g., shift manager/supervisor) has been fit-tested for an N95 mask. These will be neededonly when providing direct support for a clientwith possible TB who is so severely ill that youhave called an ambulance to get them to theemergency room. Recommended TB policy Tuberculosis March 2006 | Toronto Public Health 6566 Toronto Public Health | March 2006Questions and Answers How long do you have to be in a room with someone before you willcatch TB? The spread of this germ is influenced by many different factors including: sunlight, ventilation, closeness to the infected person and how sick the person is. Generally, it is said that you have to spend regular ongoing time (an average of eight hours a month or more) in contact with an infectious person before you might be at risk. However, routine screening for anyone dealing with high risk populations is recommended. I've heard of someone who had TB in their elbow. Is this possible? Yes, the TB germ can travel to many parts of the body and cause disease to happen. However, active TB disease is only contagious when it is in the lungs or throat. I had my blood tested at the doctor, wouldn't they have checked for TB? No. Even though a very expensive blood test has just been licensed for use in Canada (Winter 2005/2006), it is not widely available.

Its effects can range from nothing to severe diarrhea and pain. Who is at risk? Anyone can catch amoebiasis, however those who are most at risk for carrying this parasite include: recent immigrants or return visitors from regions of theworld with poor sanitation, people who have been recently institutionalized (e.g.,prison, psychiatric hospital), and men who have sex with men. The very young,the elderly and pregnant women are most at risk of developing complicationsfrom this infection. How is it spread? It can be spread through contaminated food and water but can also be spread through fecal-oral (bum to mouth) contact. Signs and symptoms Diarrhea Bloody or black/tarry feces (poop) Fever Abdominal pain Weight loss Anyone who is experiencing one or more of these symptoms should be seen by a healthcare professional for assessment. Diagnosis A healthcare professional can make a diagnosis with stool (poop) tests or blood samples that are sent to a laboratory for analysis. Treatment This infection is treated with anti-parasitic medications. In rare and severe cases, surgery may be required. Prevention and control Careful hand washing and hygiene is required, especially after going to the bathroom and before touching food. Make sure food is properly stored andcooked according to safety standards. Public Health's role Public Health will investigate individual cases and outbreaks. Education and counselling will also be provided if required.

Antibiotic Resistant Organisms or AROs are common bacteria that have developed a resistance to some or all antibiotics. AROs develop either throughnatural mutations over time or through the incorrect use of antibiotics. Somecommon AROs that you may have heard mentioned include: a) MRSA - Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus. Staphylococcus is acommon germ found on the skin. b) VRE - Vancomycin Resistant Enterococcus. Enterococcus is a commongerm found in the gut of all mammals. Who is at risk? Anyone can contract AROs but most commonly they are spread in institutions such as hospitals. People most at risk of becoming ill from an ARO includethose with weak immune systems (e.g., AIDS or cancer) and the elderly. How are they spread? AROs are often spread through direct contact with a person (touching an infected person). They can also be spread through contact with a contaminatedenvironment (e.g., unclean door knobs, counter tops, etc.). Signs and symptoms Often it is impossible to tell if someone has an ARO. Sometimes people can develop pneumonia, bladder, skin or wound infections.If you are concerned about AROs, contact a healthcare professional forassessment. Diagnosis Diagnosis is made through collecting and growing a sample (called a culture) of the germ. The culture can be swabbed from the skin, nose, bum or wounds andis a painless test. Treatment If treatment is required it will often involve powerful antibiotics. In otherwise healthy people the healthcare professional may decide to observe and let thegerm run its course. Prevention and control The best way to prevent the spread of an ARO is consistent hand washing. In some cases additional precautions may be required, but this is usually in thehospital setting. Public Health's role AROs are not a reportable disease.

Bed bugs are not new but in recent years, they have been a growing problem for hotels, shelters and hostels. Bed bugs are pests that feed off of blood and leavebites and scabs. Who is at risk? People most at risk include those living in, homeless shelters and hostels, hotels/motels, etc. How are they spread? Bed bugs live in clothing, furniture and other places where they can hide during the day but are close to people at night. They are transported in people'sbelongings and can bite many people who are using the same bed or sleepingspace. Signs and symptoms Red spots appearing on exposed skin (e.g., ankles, face, etc.) A whitish bump that appears after the bite Itchiness If you are concerned about bed bug bites, contact a healthcare professional for assessment. Diagnosis A diagnosis is based on the appearance of the bites, where they are appearing on the body and where the individual has been living or staying. Treatment The bites should be kept clean and scratching should be avoided. Protocols should be put in place for the control and prevention of bed bugs. Prevention and control Prevention should involve frequent laundering of bed linen, sealing holes in the walls, vacuuming and pest management. Public Health's role The Healthy Environment section of Toronto Public Health in partnership with the Shelters, Support and Housing Administration, monitors the bed bugsituation and provides advice on strategies. Bed bugs do not specifically causea threat to public health and are not a reportable disease.

Clostridium difficile bacteria are often seen in hospital or institutional environments. It can cause cramping and foul smelling, moderate-to-severediarrhea. Strains of C. difficile that are resistant to antibiotics have been seenin some people who acquire this infection. Who is at risk? People who are in hospitals or other institutional care settings, who have weakened immune systems or are elderly and/or are receiving multiple antibiotictherapies, are particularly at risk. How is it spread? C. difficile is spread when there is either direct or indirect contact with feces (poop) and the mouth (e.g., not washing hands properly after using thebathroom and then eating). Signs and symptoms Moderate to severe diarrhea Fever Stomach cramps Loss of appetite If you are concerned about C. difficile, contact a healthcare professional. Diagnosis Diagnosis is made through a stool (poop) sample that is analysed for bacteria in a laboratory. Treatment Sometimes no treatment is required and the bacteria goes away on its own. In other people, the bacteria goes away when antibiotic treatment is stopped. Inmore serious cases additional medications and therapy may be required. Prevention and control The best prevention for C. difficile is through frequent and thorough hand washing. Also, antibiotics should be properly used and prescribed in order toprevent resistance. Public Health's role Although C. difficile is not a reportable disease, Toronto Public Health should be consulted if an abnormally large number of people are sick with thisinfection or the above symptoms.

Chickenpox is a highly contagious viruscommonly seen in children. Who is at risk? Individuals who have not had chickenpox or been vaccinated against chickenpox are at risk. Those who have weakened immune systems and the elderly are atrisk of complications should they become infected. Generally, chickenpox tendsto affect adults more severely than it does children. How is it spread? The most common way to catch chickenpox is through direct contact with respiratory secretions (e.g., mucous) of an infected individual. It can also bespread through the air or through contact with soiled articles (e.g., clothes).Most people pass chickenpox to others before they show a rash. Signs and Symptoms Red circular itchy patches all over the body that become vesicles (bubble- like) then scab over Mild fever If you are concerned about chickenpox, contact a healthcare professional for assessment. Diagnosis Often a healthcare professional can make a diagnosis after seeing the patches (pox) on the patient. A small sample of the patches can be taken for laboratorystudy. Treatment Most treatment involves relieving the symptoms (e.g., itching). In some severe cases an antiviral drug may be used. Prevention and control People affected by chickenpox should remain isolated for five days after the onset of rash or until all spots have scabbed over. Contact Toronto Public Healthto determine the steps that should be taken in your facility. Staff should makesure that extra care is taken with hand washing if there is a known outbreak. Public Health's role Chickenpox is a reportable disease. Toronto Public Health may wish to speak with infected people to help determine where the infection came from and offerthe chickenpox vaccine to exposed people to stop further spread.

Chlamydia is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections. It is caused by bacteria called Chlamydia trachomatis. Who is at risk? Anyone who is not practising safer sex and babies born to infected mothers. How is it spread? Chlamydia is spread through unprotected anal, oral or vaginal sex with an infected person. It can take two to six weeks or longer for symptoms to appear.It can also be passed from an infected mother to her baby during delivery. Aperson remains infectious until properly treated. Signs and symptoms Many people do not have any symptoms (especially women). Symptoms can include:Women: Increased vaginal discharge and/or irritation Bleeding during or after sexual intercourse Painful lower abdomen during sex Painful or burning urination Abnormal vaginal bleeding Men: Discharge and/or itching from the penis Pain and swelling in the testicles Painful or burning urination Symptoms of Chlamydia may come and go. If you are concerned about any of the above, consult a healthcare professional for assessment. Diagnosis A sample of urine is needed. Swabs of the cervix/urethra may also be taken. Samples are sent to the laboratory for analysis. Treatment Once diagnosed, Chlamydia can be treated with antibiotics. It is important that all the antibiotics be taken and that sex be avoided for seven days aftertreatment is finished. Prevention and control Safer sex (proper and consistent use of a male or female condom) is essential to prevent the spread of Chlamydia. Regular screening for sexually transmittedinfections for those with high risk sexual behaviour is recommended. Public Health's role Chlamydia is a reportable disease. Public Health will want to speak with any infected people to determine who might have contracted it. Public Health willalso want to make sure that sexual partners are informed, tested and treated.Additional education and support are provided as needed.

A cold is caused by a viralinfection. Most people will experience such infections every year. Who is at risk? Anyone can catch a cold but those with weakened immune systems and the elderly may be more at risk of complications. How is it spread? A cold can be spread through the air with coughing and sneezing, through direct contact with an infected person and through indirect contact with objectsor surfaces that have been touched by an infected person. Signs and Symptoms Coughing Sneezing Runny nose Fever General \"sick\" feeling (malaise) If you are concerned about a cold you should speak with a healthcare professional. If a person develops any of the following symptoms they should be assessed by a healthcare professional: Earache Fever higher than 39\u00b0C (102\u00b0F) Excessive sleepiness Skin rash Rapid breathing or difficulty breathing Persistent coughing Diagnosis A diagnosis is often made based on a thorough interview combined with any obvious signs. In some cases a healthcare professional may order a swab forlaboratory analysis. Treatment As a virus causes a cold, antibiotics are not effective in treating this infection. Most treatment is aimed at controlling the symptoms (e.g., fever, runny nose,etc.). Prevention and control Effective hand washing is your best defence against the common cold. Using a tissue to cover the mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing is also aneffective barrier to prevent the spread of these germs. Public Health's role Although the common cold is not a reportable condition, Toronto Public Health should be consulted if an increased number of people or increased level ofseverity (beyond the normal) is noticed.

Every year, many people in Toronto are made quite sick by a range of germs and toxins that are found in foods which have not been properly refrigerated,cooked or stored. Some foods may come into contact with other substances (e.g., chemicals) that can also make people sick. Some of these illnesses canbe very severe and even life-threatening. Who is at risk? People who eat food that has not been properly refrigerated or cooked or is contaminated in other ways. How is it spread? A variety of germs live in food and grow well and produce toxins when the food is not stored or cooked according to accepted standards. Foodborne germs andtoxins can also be spread through food which has not been handled properly(e.g., contaminated surfaces). Signs and symptoms Although a variety of germs and toxins can cause foodborne illnesses, the following are the most common signs and symptoms: Vomiting Diarrhea Stomach cramps If you are concerned about a foodborne illness, contact a healthcare professional for assessment. Call Toronto Public Health to investigate the cause. Diagnosis Most foodborne illnesses can be diagnosed through a stool (poop) sample combined with the symptoms and information given. Treatment Most people recover on their own with treatment for their symptoms (e.g., medication for nausea). However, more serious cases can require intensetreatment and even hospitalization. Prevention and control Follow standards and the Ontario food premises regulation established for food safety. Make sure that all people who work in food preparation areas know aboutsafe food handling practices (e.g., proper temperature control, don't work withexposed skin/nose/eye infections, separate raw and cooked meat, etc.). Frequenthand washing is essential! Public Health's role Public Health inspects all food premises regularly and offers food handling courses. Public Health will investigate cases of suspected or actual foodpoisoning. All cases of food poisoning (regardless of cause) are reportable toPublic Health.

Giardiasis is caused by a parasite (protozoa) of the small intestines. Who is at risk? The elderly, the very young and people with a weak immune system are most at risk from the effects of this parasite. However, any person with severe diarrheais at risk of dehydration. How is it spread? Giardiasis can be spread directly from fecal-oral (poop to mouth) contact (e.g., changing a diaper, rimming (mouth to anus), sexual activity or indirectlythrough contaminated water or food. Signs and symptoms Watery diarrhea Very bad smelling bowel movements Weight loss Stomach pain/cramps There may be no symptoms If you are concerned about Giardiasis, contact a healthcare professional for assessment. Diagnosis A diagnosis is usually made through a thorough history, examination and then a stool (poop) sample. Treatment It is important that anyone experiencing diarrhea consume enough liquid so that they do not become dehydrated. People diagnosed with Giardiasis may beprescribed a type of drug known as an anti-protozoal (anti-parasitic). Prevention and control Thorough and frequent hand washing is one of the best methods for preventing the spread of this parasite. Those assisting people with hygiene (e.g., changingdiapers, etc.), must be especially careful to wash their hands. If contact isexpected with body fluids (e.g., poop) gloves should also be worn, followed bycareful hand washing. Public Health's role Giardiasis is a reportable disease.

In the case of hepatitis A infection, thehepatitis A virusis the cause of the inflammation. Who is at risk? Anyone who lives with a person who is infected with hepatitis A is at an increased risk of catching it. So are sexual contacts of infected persons, menwho have sex with men, injecting and non-injecting drug users and people whohave travelled to regions of the world where there is poor sanitation. How is it spread? Hepatitis A is spread through fecal-oral (poop to mouth) contact or contaminated food or water. Signs and symptoms Tiredness Abdominal pain Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and/or eyes) Loss of appetite Nausea Diarrhea Fever There may be no symptoms If you are concerned about hepatitis A infection, contact a healthcare professional for assessment. Diagnosis Diagnosis is often made through a combination of symptoms and a blood test. Treatment There is no cure for hepatitis A infection. Treatment is aimed at controlling symptoms until the virus has a chance to run its course. Prevention and control The best prevention against hepatitis A infection is regular hand washing. As well, the sexual practice of \"rimming\" (mouth to anus) should be avoided.There is a hepatitis A vaccine and it is recommended for close contacts ofcases and those who are at higher risk of infection (e.g., men who have sex withmen, injection drug users). Public Health's role Hepatitis A is a reportable disease. Public Health will also want to make sure that close contacts are informed, tested and offered vaccine. In the case of afoodhandler, Public Health will decide if there is a risk to those who haveconsumed food.

Hepatitis is a general term used to describe an inflammation (swelling) of the liver due to a number of different causes. In the case of hepatitis B infection,the hepatitis B virusis the cause of the inflammation. The hepatitis B virus can cause acute illness and can become chronic (lifelong). It can lead to severescarring and, less commonly, liver cancer. These are more likely if infectionoccurs in infancy. Who is at risk? People with multiple sexual partners, men who have sex with men, people with a diagnosis of a sexually transmitted infection, sexual partners of infectedpeople and injection drug users. Unsterilized or home-made tattooing or bodypiercing equipment can transmit it. Hepatitis B is a very common disease inless developed countries. How is it spread? The most common way is for body fluids from an infected person to enter the body of a non-immune person. It is spread through sexual contact, sharingneedles or razors, unsterlized tattooing or body piercing equipment and from aninfected mother to a baby during delivery. Signs and symptoms Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and/or eyes) Joint pain Abdominal pain Tiredness Fever There may be no symptoms If you are concerned about hepatitis B infection, contact a healthcare professional for assessment. Diagnosis Diagnosis is made through a blood test. Treatment There is no cure for hepatitis B. Infected people should be monitored regularly by their healthcare professional to watch for liver damage. If someone developsa chronic hepatitis B infection, there are antiviral medications that may beprescribed to help control the infection. Prevention and control Vaccination is an effective way to help prevent hepatitis B virus infection. As well, always practising safer sex (e.g., using condoms) can help to reduce aperson's chances of getting infected with hepatitis B. Avoid injection drugs or atleast do not re-use needles as hepatitis B virus can easily be spread in this way.Make sure that any tattooing or piercing is done with strict hygiene and usingonly sterile utensils. Public Health's role Hepatitis B infection is a reportable disease. Public Health will likely want to speak with any affected people to determine where they contracted the virusand to make sure that it has not spread. Public Health will also offer educationand resources to make sure infected people do not transmit the virus to others.Hepatitis A vaccine is offered to chronic hepatitis B carriers. Vaccines are alsooffered to contacts, high risk people and routinely to all grade 7 students.

Hepatitis is a general term used to describe an inflammation (swelling) of the liver. Hepatitis C is a virusthat affects the liver and often becomes chronic (lifelong). This can lead to scarring or cancer of the liver. Who is at risk? People who share injection equipment and people who have had direct blood-to- blood contact with an infected person. How is it spread? Hepatitis C is spread through direct blood-to-blood contact from an infected person. This can include the sharing of needles, occupational exposures andblood transfusions (although all blood is now screened for hepatitis C) andtattooing and body piercing with unsterile or home-made equipment. Motherscan also transmit hepatitis C to their infants and more rarely hepatitis C can betransmitted through sex. Sharing of other drug paraphernalia (e.g., cocainestraws and crack pipes) may also be a source of infection. Signs and symptoms Early signs and symptoms are very mild and are often missed. Symptoms can include: Nausea Weight loss Vomiting Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and/or eyes) Stomach pain Tiredness There may be no symptoms If you are concerned about hepatitis C infection, contact a healthcare professional for assessment. Diagnosis Diagnosis of hepatitis C is made through a blood test. Treatment There is no cure for hepatitis C. Many cases become chronic and require lifelong treatment in order to control the infection or to treat liver failure. Prevention and control There is no vaccine available to prevent hepatitis C. The best ways to prevent catching this virus are to avoid injection drugs, or always use clean needles, ashepatitis C can easily be spread in this way. Also, practise safer sex (e.g., usingcondoms). Make sure any tattooing or piercing is done with strict hygiene andusing only sterile utensils. Public Health's role Hepatitis C is a reportable disease. If Public Health is made aware of a hepatitis C diagnosis, they will be interested in determining where the infectioncame from so that future cases can be prevented. Public Health can alsoprovide education so the affected individual can prevent other people frombecoming infected.

The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) attacks the immune system. The immune system is the body's internal defence force against infection and somediseases. HIV can lead to Acquired Immuneodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), whichis a cluster of diseases that a person can contract when their immune system isweakened. Who is at risk? People who have unprotected anal, oral or vaginal sex, people who have multiple sex partners, injection drug users and people who received bloodproducts prior to 1985. HIV can also be passed from an infected mother to herbaby during birth or breastfeeding. How is it spread? HIV is spread through direct blood-to-blood contact and through direct contact with certain body fluids (semen, vaginal secretions and blood). Unprotectedanal and vaginal sex and injection drug use through the sharing of needles areknown to be high risk activities. HIV can also be spread through unprotectedoral sex, from a mother to her baby at birth or through breastfeeding. Casualcontact can not spread HIV. Signs and symptoms Initially, people infected with HIV may experience a brief illness similar to mononucleosis (mono) with tiredness, swollen lymph nodes, etc. This illnesswill clear up on its own and the individual may be symptom-free for many years.If left untreated, the immune system deteriorates and the individual maydevelop certain infections. Possible signs and symptoms can include: Frequent or severe pneumonia Swollen lymph nodes Oral thrush (white patches) Night sweats If you are concerned about HIV or AIDS, contact a healthcare professional for assessment. Diagnosis HIV can be diagnosed with a blood test. AIDS is diagnosed through a combination of a confirmed HIV infection, additional blood tests and thepresence of certain infections. Treatment There is no cure for HIV. However, with lifelong (anti-retroviral) medication, people can live longer and healthier lives with this virus. Prevention and control The best prevention for HIV is through safer sex and harm reduction. Condoms should always be used for sex and needles should never be shared. HIV positivewomen should be counselled about using anti-retroviral treatment and notbreastfeeding. Public Health's role HIV/AIDS is a reportable disease. Public Health will want to speak with any affected people so that they may determine who might have contracted it.Public Health will also want to make sure that sexual partners or others exposedare informed, tested and provided with additional education and support asneeded.

Impetigo often affects school-aged children and people who live in crowded conditions, play contact sports (e.g. skin-to-skin contact) or have skinproblems/irritations. How is it spread? Impetigo can be spread from one part of the body to another by scratching with contaminated fingers. It can also be spread on bed sheets, towels or clothingthat has been in contact with infected skin. Signs and symptoms There are several types of impetigo with different symptoms. Impetigo contagiosa (most common type): Red sores and tiny blisters, often on the face, that rupture (pop) and ooze a clear fluid or pus that turns into a honey-coloured crust Itchiness Bullous impetigo (usually affects children under two years old): Larger blisters, usually on the body arms and legs Sometimes a fever, diarrhoea and/or general weakness Ecthyma (most serious type) rare form of deep infection with ulcers If you are concerned about impetigo, contact a healthcare professional for assessment. Diagnosis A diagnosis can be made through the symptoms and a sample of the infected area or fluid may be sent to the laboratory for analysis. Treatment Antibiotics are used to treat impetigo. Depending on how serious the infection is they may be given in a cream/ointment or by mouth (pills). Prevention and control Washing hands and good personal hygiene is important in prevention. If a person has impetigo, the affected area should be kept clean. They may alsowant to cover the area with gauze or a bandage to prevent scratching and keepmedicated cream on the area. Also, fingernails should be kept short to preventscratching. Public Health's role Impetigo on the skin is not a reportable disease. The bacteria that cause impetigo (streptococci and staphylococci) may cause other, more seriousdiseases that are reportable to Public Health.

Influenza (flu) is a serious respiratory infection caused by a virus. It is different from, and more serious than, the common cold. Every year there are outbreaksof influenza. Every 30 to 40 years there can be a more serious pandemic (anepidemic that involves a very large geographic area). Who is at risk? People with any of the following conditions are more at risk of a serious infection: Chronic heart or lung disorders Diabetes or kidney disease Cancer or a weak immune system (including HIV infection) Anaemia Those over 65 years old and residents of nursing homes How is it spread? Influenza is spread through droplets when someone coughs or sneezes. It can spread through the air in crowded enclosed spaces. It is also spread throughdirect contact with contaminated hands/skin and indirect contact withcontaminated objects (e.g., door knobs). Influenza arises seasonally (most oftenoccurring in the fall and winter months). Signs and symptoms Fever Dry cough Tiredness/a general \"sick\" feeling Body aches/headache In children there may also be vomiting and diarrhoea If you are concerned about influenza, contact a healthcare professional for assessment. Diagnosis Testing often involves a swab inserted in the nose to collect a sample to be sent to the laboratory for analysis. Treatment Influenza is a virus, therefore antibiotics are not effective against it. Most often, treatment is for the symptoms (e.g., dehydration, high fever, etc.). In someserious cases, a healthcare professional may prescribe an antiviral drug, but thisis only effective in certain circumstances. Prevention and control One of the most effective methods for preventing influenza is frequent hand washing. Additionally, the influenza vaccine is now free to all residents ofOntario. It is strongly recommended for anyone who works or resides ininstitutional settings (e.g., hospitals, hostels and shelters). People with eggallergies should not receive this vaccine. Public Health's role Public Health is actively involved in the prevention of influenza.

Lice have been a problem for centuries. Although there is no serious medical risk posed by lice, they are a serious annoyance and can affect someone'squality of life. Head lice live on the scalp and lay their eggs on the base of ahuman hair shaft. Body lice live on clothing and lay their eggs on clothing fibreswhich are then incubated by body heat. Who is at risk? School-aged children and other people who have frequent direct physical contact with many people on a regular basis (e.g., people living in a hostel orshelter). How is it spread? Head lice are spread through direct physical contact with an infested person. Head lice must physically transfer from one hair to another. Body lice aretransmitted through shared bedding and/or clothing. The eggs of body lice aredeposited in clothing fibres. Eggs (or nits) are frequently found in seams andfolds of clothing where body heat is greatest. Signs and symptoms Itching Lice on the hair or body Nits (tiny white eggs found at the base of hair or in clothing seams) Small red bitesIf you are concerned about head or body lice or any of the above symptoms,contact a healthcare professional for assessment. Diagnosis A diagnosis is made by seeing either the lice or nits in combination with the above symptoms. Treatment There are many over-the-counter treatments available from pharmacies. Most chemical treatments will kill the lice with a single application, but themanufacturer's instructions should always be followed. Following a chemicaltreatment, nits must also be physically removed from the hair with a finetoothed nit comb (also available from pharmacies). Clothes and bedding shouldbe laundered in hot water and/or dried in a hot dryer for at least 20 minutes.Natural treatments do exist, but their effectiveness can vary. Contact ahealthcare professional for guidance. The Harrison Baths (416-392-7984) hasa program to assist with delousing. Prevention and control Prevention of lice can be a challenge, especially when people live and work in crowded conditions. Check hair at first sign of itching. Wash and dry ALL clothing in HOT temperatures during a lice outbreak. Sealing articles in plastic bags for at least 10 days will kill lice. Do not share combs or brushes. Discard or disinfect infested combs and brushes by soaking for an hour in rubbing alcohol (70 per cent isopropyl alcohol). Frequent vacuuming of living and sleeping areas.

Anyone who has not had measles or been immunized, and infants who have not yet received vaccination. Measles can be severe in infants and adults. How is it spread? Measles is a very contagious airborne infection. People can contract it from tiny droplets of fluid released into the air by an infected person. Direct contact withnose or throat fluids or articles soiled with those fluids can also spread it. Aperson can transmit the infection from four days before the rash appears to fourdays after it appears. Signs and symptoms Symptoms occur in two stages: First stage: Runny nose Red and watery eyes that are sensitive to light Low grade fever Cough Second stage: After three to seven days a high fever develops Red rash, first on face then moving down the body White spots inside the mouth If you are concerned about measles, contact a healthcare professional for assessment as soon as possible. Diagnosis Measles is diagnosed through a physical examination and a blood test that is sent for laboratory analysis. Treatment There is no cure for measles. Treatment often involves helping people with the symptoms until the infection clears on its own. In severe cases, hospitalizationmay be required. Prevention and control Measles vaccination is routinely given to children in Canada. It is a safe and effective way of preventing this infection. For people who are not vaccinated butsuspect that they might have come into contact with measles, it is important tosee a healthcare professional as soon as possible as certain therapies may helpprevent contracting the infection.

Meningitis is a general term that refers to swelling in the lining of the brain and spinal cord. There are many different causes of meningitis including bacteria,fungi and viruses. Different types of meningitis are treated differently. Who is at risk? People who have a weak immune system, the elderly, people who have had recent neurosurgical procedures and those who have recently been in contactwith an infected person. How is it spread? Bacterial: There are a number of bacteria that can cause meningitis. The most serious type is called meningococcal meningitis. The most common way ofcontracting a bacterial form of meningitis is through direct contact with nose /throat secretions from an infected person (e.g., kissing, sharing cigarettes). Fungal: Various forms of fungus can also cause meningitis. This is a rare form of meningitis that is often seen in people with weak immune systems.Viral: This is the most common form of meningitis. Many different types of viruses can cause this condition. Depending on the type of virus, there aremany different ways that it can be spread, but most often it is through direct orindirect contact (e.g., handling of food, sharing of drinks, sneezing, etc.). Signs and symptoms Stiff/painful neck Headache Rash Fever Disorientation/confusion General \"sick\" feeling If you are concerned about meningitis, contact a healthcare professional for assessment as soon as possible. Diagnosis Diagnosis is often made through a thorough examination and history. Based on the findings the healthcare professional may test the fluid in the spinal cord forinfection. Additional tests such as a CT scan may also be ordered. Treatment Treatment depends on the type of germ that is affecting the person and that person's level of health. It is important to know that antibiotics are onlyeffective against bacterial meningitis. Most cases of viral meningitis clear upon their own. Prevention and control There is a vaccine available only for bacterial meningitis (meningococcal) Hand washing Not sharing drinks/food/cigarettes Public Health's role Any form of meningitis is a reportable condition. Public Health may wish to speak with the affected person to determine how the infection was caught.

Molluscum contagiosum is a skin infection caused by a virus. Who is at risk? People with a weak immune system might have a more severe infection. Additionally, children are more likely to get molluscum than adults. How is it spread? Molluscum contagiosum is spread through direct contact with the skin of an infected person or by sexual contact. Scratching can also spread the infection. Signs and symptoms Tiny \"pinpoints\" appear on the skin one to six months after exposure The \"pinpoints\" grow into pinkish-white bumps that are smooth and shiny Bumps have a dip in the middle and a milky-white liquid inside Bumps can appear anywhere on the body If you are concerned about molluscum contagiosum, contact a healthcare professional for assessment. Diagnosis It is usually diagnosed by its appearance but can often be mistaken for a wart. Treatment Sometimes the infection disappears on its own without treatment. Even if treated, molluscum can reappear. Podophyllin, liquid nitrogen or surgicalremoval can treat molluscum. Treatment may need to be repeated. Prevention and control The use of condoms lowers the chances of contracting molluscum contagiosum through sexual contact. Frequent and proper hand washing is a good practicefor preventing direct contact transmission.

Norwalk virusis a common cause of vomiting and diarrhea each winter. Who is at risk? Outbreaks occur in large institutional settings (e.g., hostels, hospitals, etc.). People with weakened immune systems and the elderly may experience a moresevere infection. How is it spread? Norwalk virus lives in the stomach and intestines (guts) of people. Therefore, both the feces (poop) and vomit of infected people carry this virus. It is spreadthrough the fecal-oral route (e.g., poop to mouth) and through indirect contact(e.g., door knobs that have been handled by a contaminated individual) as wellas through contaminated food or water. It is possible that it might also bespread through the air, but this is not clear. Signs and symptoms Nausea Watery diarrhea Vomiting Fever Stomach cramps Symptoms usually last for one to two days. If you are concerned about Norwalk virus, contact a healthcare professional for assessment. Diagnosis Sometimes a stool (poop) sample will be required, but if the symptoms resolve rapidly, this is not necessary. Treatment As this is a viral infection, antibiotics are not effective. Treatment is usually for the symptoms (e.g., lots of fluids, medications for nausea, fever, etc.). Prevention and control Frequent hand washing is an excellent way to prevent this infection. Anyone with symptoms of Norwalk virus should not be handling food that may be eatenby others. Public Health's role Although Norwalk virus is not a reportable disease, any large number of cases or increases in the above symptoms should be reported to Public Health. PublicHealth will investigate and recommend ways to reduce the spread. Informationand guidance can be provided on request.

This is an infection of the covering of the eyeball called the conjunctiva. It is usually caused by viruses but can also be caused by bacteria . Occasionally people can develop the symptoms of pink eye due to allergies. Who is at risk? People who work or live in institutional settings where there is frequent close contact (e.g., schools, hospitals, shelters). How is it spread? Pink eye is spread through contact with infected fluids from the eye (e.g., tears, drainage). It can be transmitted through shared eye makeup or contaminatedhands. Signs and symptoms Redness and itchiness of one or both eyes \"Sticky\" fluid from infected eye Swelling of the eyelid If you are concerned about pink eye, contact a healthcare professional for assessment. Diagnosis A sample of fluid from the eye is often required to determine what is causing the symptoms. Treatment Bacterial pink eye can often be successfully treated with antibiotic eye drops. There is usually no treatment for viral pink eye. Prevention and control Good hand washing is essential. People with untreated pink eye should avoid close contact with other people and use separate towels and linen. Contact ahealthcare professional for specific instructions. Public Health's role Although pink eye is not a reportable disease, information and guidance is available from Public Health.

Rubella is a viralinfection, which causes a rash and other associated symptoms. It can be particularly harmful to unborn children. Who is at risk? People who have not had rubella and are not immunized. Unborn children of mothers who do not have immunity, as it can cause Congenital RubellaSyndrome. This syndrome can result in hearing, vision and heart problems, aswell as developmental delays. How is it spread? Rubella is spread when people breathe in droplets released into the air by an infected person or through direct contact with nasal/throat secretions. Signs and symptoms Mild fever Swollen lymph glands in the neck Rash Symptoms can start to emerge before the onset of the rash Children and adults can have different symptoms If you are concerned about rubella, contact a healthcare professional. Diagnosis A diagnosis is made through a history, examination and blood test. Treatment In healthy children and young adults, rubella is usually a mild disease with no specific treatment available. Individuals with more severe symptoms should bereferred for medical care. Prevention and control Immunization is an effective way to prevent this disease. Thorough hand washing and use of barriers (e.g., tissues) when sneezing are also important forstopping the spread of contact and droplet infections such as rubella. Public Health's role Rubella is a reportable disease. Public Health will want to speak with affected people to determine where the infection came from and how it can be stopped.Public Health will also try to identify pregnant female contacts and refer forblood tests. A vaccine may be offered to contacts. Public Health will alsoprovide education and guidance materials as needed.

Scabies is a disease caused by a common mite (a tiny bug related to spiders) called Sarcoptes scabiei. These mites burrow (dig) under the top layer of theskin where they lay eggs. These eggs cause a reaction in the skin which may bevery itchy and red. Who is at risk? People who live or stay in crowded conditions (e.g., nursing homes, shelters, day nurseries) where there is often skin-to-skin contact. Also, people withweakened immune systems or older people are at risk of a more severeinfestation called Norwegian or crusting scabies. How is it spread? Scabies can be spread either sexually or non-sexually through close physical contact. A person can also catch scabies through prolonged contact with (e.g.,sleeping in or wearing) bed sheets, furniture or clothing. Signs and symptoms Pimple-like bumps on the skin Itching (worse at night) Burrow (digging) tracks especially in between the fingers, in the groin areaor between toes If you are concerned about scabies, contact a healthcare professional for assessment. Diagnosis A diagnosis can be made based on signs and symptoms. Rarely, a healthcare professional may try to find the bug in the skin and look at it under amicroscope to confirm the diagnosis. Samples from the affected areas may becollected. Treatment Scabies is often treated with creams that are left on the body overnight (approximately seven-eight hours) and then washed off. It is very important tocarefully follow the instructions for the medication. You may need more thanone treatment to get rid of the infestation. The itchiness may last for a fewweeks after treatment even if there are no scabies present. Prevention and control Not sharing the towels, linens or clothes of infected people and making sure that infestations are quickly treated are all important steps. Also, infectedpeople should not have intimate (e.g., sexual) contact until the infestation hascleared. Public Health's role Scabies is not a reportable disease. Public Health takes an active interest in making sure that common standards of hygiene and cleanliness are followed soinfestations can be avoided.

SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) is a viral infection, which causes a severe pneumonia-like condition. Pneumonia is an inflammation of the air sacksin the lungs. When people have pneumonia, the lungs fill with fluid, whichmakes it difficult for oxygen to get into the blood. SARS was first recognized inFebruary 2003. Who is at risk? People in close contact with a case and those who have recently travelled to affected regions of the world. How is it spread? SARS is spread from person-to-person by close contact (i.e. living with, caring for, or direct contact with, respiratory secretions/body fluids of a case). Signs and symptoms Fever (over 38\u00b0C or 100.4\u00b0F) Dry cough Shortness of breath Difficulty breathing Muscle aches If you are concerned about SARS, contact a healthcare professional for assessment. Diagnosis There is currently no approved test to detect SARS. A healthcare professional makes a diagnosis of SARS by looking at the symptoms, combined with a recenthistory of potential exposure and chest x-ray. Additional blood tests can beordered and may assist in the diagnosis. Treatment There is no cure for SARS. Treatment is usually for the symptoms caused by the infection (e.g., fever, problems breathing). People with SARS are usually treatedin hospital so they can be properly isolated and monitored. Prevention and control Public health agencies around the world monitor for possible cases at all times. If an outbreak is suspected, travellers will be warned in advance. As with allinfections, regular hand washing is one of the best defences. A healthcareprofessional should assess anyone with an abnormal or worsening cough or highfever. Public Health's role SARS is a reportable condition. Public Health will want to speak with any person who has been diagnosed with SARS to determine where the infectioncame from and how best to contain it. Public Health will also be involved in theisolation of cases and monitoring/quarantining of close contacts.

Staphylococcus aureus is a type of bacteria that often causes skin infections and can range from mild to life-threatening. Common skin problems associatedwith staphylococcal infections include: impetigo follicles), furuncles (boil), carbuncles (deep skininfection), abscesses (large fluid filled skin infections), infected wounds and,less commonly, toxic shock syndrome. Who is at risk? Newborn children Chronically ill, elderly and immune-compromised people Injection drug users How is it spread? Staphylococcus germs often live in the nose. It is common for individuals to infect their own skin after coming into contact with nose drops (mucous).People can transmit staphylococcus germs to each other through direct orindirect contact with nose drops or infected wounds. Signs and symptoms Infected wounds may appear to be: Red Warm to the touch Swollen Sometimes a staphylococcus infection may include: Fever Headache Loss of appetite A general sick feeling If you are concerned about staphylococcus, contact a healthcare professional for assessment. Diagnosis A sample of the affected area (a swab) will be sent to the laboratory for analysis. Treatment Staphylococcus infections are treated with antibiotics. It is important that the antibiotics be finished in order to avoid drug resistance. Prevention and control The best way to prevent staphylococcus infections is with thorough hand washing and good personal hygiene. Public Health's role Although staphylococcus aureus infection is not a reportable disease, any abnormal (higher than normal) number of cases should be reported so thatsources can be investigated. Public Health will provide education and guidanceas needed. More information Toronto Health Connection: 416-338-7600Information Sheet March 2006 | Toronto Public Health 95 Streptococcal Infections (Group A Streptococci) What is it? Group A Streptococci are bacteria that can cause a wide variety of diseases including strep-throat, skin infections, scarlet fever and rheumatic fever. Who is at risk? All people are susceptible to catching streptococcal infections. For people who have had rheumatic fever, there is an increased risk of developing additionalrheumatic infections. How is it spread? Streptococcal infections are often spread through airborne droplets or direct contact with an infected person. Signs and symptoms Symptoms vary depending on the part of the body affected but can include: Sore throat with redness and swelling Fever Swollen lymph nodes Skin redness/discharge/scabbing Streptococcal infections can produce many symptoms. If you are concerned about streptococcal infections, contact a healthcare professional forassessment. Diagnosis Diagnosis is through an examination and culture (e.g., throat swab) which will be sent for laboratory analysis. Treatment Streptococcal infections are usually treated with antibiotics. It is important to finish any medications that are prescribed. Prevention and control People who are exhibiting signs of sickness (e.g., fever, sore throat) should not be going to work and should try to minimize contact with others until oneffective antibiotics for 24 hours. Consistent and proper hand washing is animportant infection control measure. Public Health's role Non-invasive streptococcal infections (skin infections, strep throat, etc.) are not reportable to Public Health. However, when a streptococcal infection becomesinternal (invasive), it is reportable. Public Health will want to speak to affectedpeople to determine what the source of the infection was and how futureinfections can be stopped. Education and resources will be provided as needed.

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by a bacterium called treponema pallidum. Who is at risk? Any sexually active person, especially those who do not practise safer sex. Injection drug users and babies born to infected mothers are also at risk. Thereis an ongoing outbreak among gay and bisexual men in Toronto. How is it spread? Syphilis is spread from person-to-person during sex (anal, oral or vaginal). It is spread by direct contact with the syphilis sores or rashes. It can also be spreadthrough sharing needles or passed from an infected mother to her newborn babyduring pregnancy. Signs and symptoms Many infected people have no signs or symptoms of syphilis. If symptoms do develop, they tend to show from three weeks after exposure. In the first stage, or primary stage, a painless hard sore called a chancre may appear on the penis, buttocks, vagina, throat or any other site wherethe bacteria entered the body. After four to six weeks the chancre will goaway, even with no treatment. If untreated, the next stage, or secondary stage, usually occurs from four to 10 weeks after the chancre appears. This stage may involve a rash formingon the palms of the hands, soles of the feet or any other part of the body.Sometimes there is patchy hair loss, muscle and joint pain or swollenglands. These symptoms may disappear without treatment. If left untreated, the person may develop the third stage which will usually happen in 10-20 years (sometimes earlier if the person has HIV). Thisstage can involve very serious brain, heart and bone disease. Can cause congenital syphilis in a baby born to an infected mother. If you are concerned about syphilis, contact a healthcare professional for assessment. Diagnosis A syphilis diagnosis is made with a blood test. It can take two to 12 weeks for syphilis to show up in the blood. Treatment Syphilis can be treated and cured with antibiotics. Prevention and control It is important to always practise safer sex (e.g., using a condom). It is important to avoid having sex with anyone who has sores in their genital region.All pregnant women should be tested for syphilis and injection drug usersshould never share needles. Routine testing for sexually transmitted infectionsis recommended if there is high risk sexual behaviour. Public Health's role Syphilis is a reportable disease. Public Health will want to speak with any affected people to determine who might have contracted it. Public Health willalso want to make sure that sexual partners are informed, tested and treatedand provide additional education and support as is needed.

TB is an infectious disease caused by a bacterium called mycobacterium tuberculosis. TB usually attacks the lungs but can affect any part of the body. Who is at risk? People who were born or who lived in areas of the world where there is a lot of TB disease People who are homeless or under-housed People with weak immune systems (due to HIV/AIDS, cancer, kidney failure, diabetes, drug users, alcoholics) Contacts of people with active TB People who have lived on a reserve or in an Inuit community Elderly people who lived through a time when TB was common Staff and residents of shelters, jails, long-term care facilities, hospitals How is it spread? The germ is spread from person-to-person through the air when someone who is sick with TB in their lungs or throat, coughs or sneezes. It is not highlycontagious. Close, prolonged or regular contact with someone who is sick withactive TB disease is needed to spread it. Signs and symptoms TB infection (inactive): Most people who breathe in TB bacteria are able to stop them from growing. The immune system traps the bacteria and keeps theperson healthy. This is called TB infection (inactive) and these people: Do not feel sick/have no symptoms Have a positive TB skin test May develop active TB disease anytime during their life Cannot spread TB germs Active TB disease: TB bacteria become active when the body's immune system cannot stop them from growing. The active TB bacteria begin to multiply andcause damage to the body. Some symptoms of active TB disease in the lungsare: New or worsening cough (lasts longer than three weeks) Fever/night sweats/chills Fatigue Unexplained weight loss/loss of appetite If the TB disease is in another part of the body, the symptoms will depend on where the TB disease is located (e.g., swollen lymph nodes). Diagnosis Screening for TB infection (inactive) is done by a TB skin test. A positive TB skin test means a person has TB germs in their body. A physical examination,chest x-ray and sputum (mucous collected from the lungs) test are done tocheck for active TB disease. please turn over for more informationInformation Sheet March 2006 | Toronto Public Health 98 Treatment TB is a preventable, treatable and curable disease. People with TB infection (inactive) may benefit from medicine to prevent active TB disease. People withactive TB disease must complete antibiotic treatment to cure TB. TB drugs areprovided free through Public Health. Prevention and control All shelter staff and volunteers should be screened for TB when starting work and annually thereafter. All shelter staff and volunteers should receive TBeducation (includes awareness of symptoms and how to refer an ill resident forassessment). Public Health's role TB is a reportable disease. Public Health does a thorough investigation of people diagnosed with active TB disease and traces their contacts. Educationand directly observed medication therapy are offered.

West Nile Virus is a mosquito-borne virus that infects birds, animals and humans. The risk of infection is low and fewer than one per cent of infectedpeople become seriously ill. Who is at risk? Mosquitoes are most active at night, especially during dusk and dawn. Therefore, people who sleep outdoors and are outside in the early morning andearly evening are at increased risk of getting mosquito bites. Also, people overthe age of 55 and those with compromised immune systems (e.g., HIV orcancer) are at a higher risk of developing complications, if they becomeinfected. How is it spread? West Nile Virus is a blood-borne illness spread by mosquitoes to people. People cannot transmit this infection to each other. Signs and symptoms Many people show no signs or symptoms, but symptoms can include: Fever Headaches Body aches Skin rash Swollen glands People with a severe infection may develop: Stiff neck Confusion Sensitivity to light If you are concerned about West Nile Virus, contact a healthcare professional for assessment. Diagnosis Diagnosis is made with a blood test. Treatment There is no cure for West Nile Virus. Treatment usually involves reducing the impact of the symptoms (i.e. lowering the fever, easing pain). please turn over for more informationInformation Sheet March 2006 | Toronto Public Health 99 Prevention and control Cover up as much as possible and tuck pants into socks for extra protection. Try to wear light-coloured clothing, including long-sleeved shirts, or a jacket andlong pants. Avoid locations with a large number of mosquitoes, such as ravines,or areas with a lot of bushes and trees, especially in the early morning and earlyevening. When wearing extra clothing, drink lots of water to reduce the risk ofheat stress.Toronto Public Health recommends repellents containing 10 per cent DEET orless for adults. Only apply to exposed skin and clothing and only when necessary. Use small amounts and never on cuts, wounds, sunburns or irritated skin. Seek medical attention if DEET is swallowed. Avoid using DEET on a regular basis, only use as necessary. Note that insect repellent may reduce the effectiveness of sunscreen. Products containing both sunscreen and repellent are not recommended. Be sure to wash repellent off daily. Some alternatives to DEET (e.g., soybean oil) have been approved for use by Health Canada. Check products as some are not recommended for childrenunder three years of age. Contact a healthcare professional for more information. Public Health's role West Nile Virus illnesses are reportable to Toronto Public Health. Public Health actively monitors for cases of West Nile Virus through routine and targetedinvestigations. West Nile Virus is a reportable infection and Public Health willwant to speak with any affected person to determine how they contracted theinfection so that other infections might be prevented. Public Health also offerseducation and resources to the public. More information Toronto Health Connection: 416-338-7600 www.toronto.ca/healthWest Nile Virus Information SheetWhooping Cough (Pertussis) What is it? Pertussis is a bacterial infection of the respiratory system that produces severe coughing often compared to a \"whooping\" sound. Most people receivechildhood vaccinations to prevent the spread of this infection. Who is at risk? Unvaccinated/under-vaccinated children and adults and individuals whose protection has worn off are at particular risk. Anyone who is a close contact ofan infected person is at risk as pertussis is highly contagious. How is it spread? Pertussis is spread through direct contact with infected bodily fluids, especially respiratory mucous. It is also believed to be spread through droplets in the air. Signs and symptoms Severe coughing, many coughs can be followed by \"crowing\" or \"whooping\" sounds Vomiting after coughing Fever If you are concerned about pertussis, contact a healthcare professional for assessment. Diagnosis Diagnosis is often made through a combination of symptoms and laboratory tests that are conducted on mucous samples taken from the back of the nose. Treatment This infection is usually treated with antibiotics and can sometimes require hospitalization. Prevention and control One of the most effective methods for preventing the spread of whooping cough (pertussis) is through childhood vaccinations. If someone is already infectedthey should be isolated until they receive at least five days of antibiotictreatment. If no antibiotic treatment is received, the isolation lasts for 21 days.Routine practices (e.g., hand washing) should be followed until medicationshave had a chance to take effect. Droplet precautions are also recommended ifproviding direct care for an infected person. Public Health's role Pertussis is a reportable disease. Public Health will likely want to speak with the affected individual and their close contacts to attempt to control the spreadof this infection. Antibiotics and vaccination of contacts under seven years ofage will also be considered.

This section is intended to give frontline staff an idea of whatcertain medications are used forand how they are taken. Thisinformation is very general. For up-to-date and detailed information,consult a healthcare professional orpharmacist. Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy(HAART) (Used for the treatment of HIV / AIDS) HAART therapy is a highly potent combination of drugs that must betaken by some patients living withHIV. These drugs (often referred toas the \"cocktail\") work together toprevent the virus from reproducingitself or stop it from infecting newcells. When taken properly, thesedrugs are very effective at treatingHIV infection and prolonging life,but they do not completelyeliminate the virus from the body. There are some considerations to be aware of for people who are onone of the many HAARTcombinations. First of all, thesedrugs are highly effective but canalso be toxic. People taking thesedrugs may experience side effectsthat can sometimes make themfeel sick.One challenge of taking these medications is the scheduling.Unlike many other medications,there is not a lot of flexibilityscheduling HAART treatments.Medications MUST be taken at thesame time every day, with orwithout food according to theinstructions. Missing even a fewdoses can result in the virusmutating and becoming resistant totreatment. HAART medications are usually taken in pill form and come indifferent shapes, colours and sizes.Some of the newer medications(fusion inhibitors) are now taken asinjections in the stomach. More information The AIDS Committee of Toronto (ACT): 416-340-8484 www.actoronto.ca Canadian AIDS Treatment Information Exchange: 416-203-7122 www.catie.ca Anti-tuberculosis drugs (Used for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB)) There are two reasons that anti- tuberculosis drugs are used. Thefirst is to cure people who areinfected with the germ and havedeveloped TB disease. The secondis to kill the germ in people whohave been infected withtuberculosis, but have notdeveloped the disease. To cure TB disease: When someone has been exposed to thetuberculosis germ and hasdeveloped TB disease they need totake a combination of medicationsfor a long period of time in order tofight this infection. There are many types of tuberculosis drugs used incombination to cure the disease.When a person is prescribed thesedrugs, some will only be used atthe beginning of the treatment andthen stopped, while others willhave to be taken for many months. To treat TB infection: People do not always get sick after being infectedwith the TB germ. In some people,the body is able to build a wallaround the germ, which prevents itfrom affecting the organs of thebody. These people are notinfectious to others. While thebody has been able to stop the TBdisease from attacking the organs,it is possible for the germ tobecome active in the future. Thisis why TB infection is oftentreated. To treat the infection aperson must remain on anti-tuberculosis drugs for quite sometime. People taking these medications may have unpleasant side effectsthat can sometimes make themfeel sick. A healthcare professionalshould assess any long-lasting orserious side effects. Also, thesedrugs should not be taken withalcohol as it can cause liverdamage. As this is a long-lasting medication regime that can be hard for somepatients to manage, Toronto PublicHealth offers the option of DirectlyObserved Therapy (DOT). A DOTworker gives daily medications topeople who are part of the DOTprogram. In this way doses are notmissed and side-effects can bemonitored. Appendix 9: MedicationsAppendicesMarch 2006 | Toronto Public Health 117Medications Appendices It is very important that these medications are taken every day, atthe same time, as prescribed bythe healthcare professional. Ifmedications are frequently missedor the schedule changed, it cancause the TB germ to developresistance to the drugs.

When usedcorrectly, antibiotics are a verypowerful tool in fighting someinfections. Like all medication, they are not without risk. Some antibiotics cancause mild to serious side effectsdepending on the person who istaking them and how their bodyreacts to the drug. It is importantto be aware that antibiotics areonly effective against bacterialinfections.When taking antibiotics, it is VERY important to finish all themedication. Sometimes peoplestop taking the medication oncethe symptoms go away. Justbecause someone does not feelsick does not mean that theinfection is gone. When antibioticsare stopped too soon, it can teacha bacterial infection how tobecome resistant to its effects,which can lead to very serious,even life-threatening, infections. If an antibiotic has to be stoppeddue to side effects, it is importantthat it is done so in discussionwith a healthcare professional.He/she may wish to change themedications rather than stop themaltogether. If the side effects arevery serious, emergency careshould be arranged. If you have questions about antibiotics, you should speak withyour healthcare professional.118 Toronto Public Health | March 2006Bed bugs are a problem in many settings, including apartments,hotels and rooming houses. Therehave also been bed buginfestations in some Torontoshelters. While the bugsthemselves are a pest and not aninfectious disease, they can bedifficult to control and eliminate. Suggestions to reduce the spread and impactof bed bugs. Intake 1. Ask if the client has previously been staying in a place withbed bugs. If yes - where possible, consid- er washing and drying all theirbelongings. Thirty minutes ina dryer at 36\u00b0C or hottershould reduce the number (ifany) of bed bugs. 2. Ask the client if he/she has any bed bug bites. If yes - where possible, offer laundering. Remember, cleanclothes reduce the chance ofinfection for open sores. Clients should not be denied admission to a shelter on the basis of suspected or confirmed bed bugs.Minimizing the impact of bed bugs 1. Laundry: Frequent laundering of clothes (especially drying) is an important control technique. 2. Storage of belongings: For those belongings not laundered, consider storing in a sealedplastic bag. Also, try to storebelongings away from the sleeping area. 3. Check for bed bugs: Look for small bloodstains on bedding.Check for bugs in pillowcasesand on elasticized corners. 4. Change the position of the bed/alter bed frame: Beds should be moved so they are at least twoinches from the wall. Beddingshould not touch the floor. You can alter a wooden bed- frame in the following ways: Seal all the wood with aglossy wood sealer. Apply a one inch band of petroleum jelly (e.g., Vaseline)around each leg. Place each leg of the bed in a clean polished metal can(e.g., old soup cans) or wrapeach leg with metal tape. Wrap double-sided tape around each leg (make surethe tape is tight). Place an insect glue trap under each bed leg.5. Change the bed frame: Bed bugs have difficulty walking on polished metal surfaces.Consider replacing wooden bed-frames with metal ones. 6. Sealing the mattress: Mattresses sealed with plastic are difficultfor bed bugs to walk on. 7. Vacuum frequently: Make sure that vacuum contents are emptied, sealed and disposedof immediately. 8. Small mattress tears: Small mat- tress tears should be mendedor covered (e.g., using ducttape) as soon as possible. 9. Eliminate hiding places: Try to seal holes in the walls and watchout for posters, curtains andother textured fixtures whichare good daytime hidingplaces for bed bugs. 10. Inspect donations of furniture and clothes. Any facility that provides shelter or short term accommodation should have a contract in place with a licenced pest-control professional. Appendix 10: Prevention and control of bed bugsAppendicesMarch 2006 | Toronto Public Health 119Toronto is a large and extremely diverse city. With so many peoplewho call this city home, it isimportant that services andprograms are welcoming and safe for everybody. Homeless orunder-housed persons haveenormous day-to-day stresses andadding the burden of infection anddisease complicate things further.Dealing with an infectious diseasecan be scary enough, but theadded stress of having to deal withthe healthcare system can be aterrifying ordeal for some. All of us (e.g., frontline workers, health workers) who are providingservices to people who arehomeless and affected byinfectious diseases have anobligation to be sensitive to theneeds and fears of the people weserve. Beyond the physical, it is important to consider howinfectious diseases might affectdifferent people in different ways.Some people may have had badexperiences dealing withgovernment agencies and will findit difficult to share personalinformation about themselves withauthority figures. Others may beconfused or scared by restrictionsimposed on them in order tocontrol the spread of infection.Still others may need someone whocan translate into a language theycan understand or support frompeople who they define to be closefriends or family. Whatever the case, on a day-to-day basis and particularly in the caseof sickness or an outbreak, it isimportant to be aware and torespond to client needs.Consider women Try to facilitate access to healthcare professionals of the client's choice (e.g., maleor female). Try to assist with child care. Consider immigrants Try to facilitate access to inter- pretation services for medicalexams/interviews. Make sure the client clearly understands what is going on. Explain why other agencies are involved. Do not make assumptions about a client's health beliefsand practices. Consider sexual and gender orientation Make sure meaningful supports (e.g., friends, partners, spouses), as definedby the client, are allowedaccess to their loved oneswhen they are ill. If possible, try to facilitate access to sensitive careproviders, such as gay or lesbian healthcare profes-sionals or gender aware clinics (e.g., SherbourneHealth Centre) when this is an identified need. Do not make assumptions about a person's HIV statusbased on their sexual orientation.Consider access In the face of special measures that may be taken to control infection, consideraccess to facilities and try tomake sure that all people areaccommodated. Make sure that signs clearly explain access options. If transportation is required to medical facilities, try andmake sure there are accessibleoptions. Consider mental health Make sure additional assistance is available to support new measures (e.g., wearing masks). Have mental health supports available for clients who may require additional counselling/reassurance. Attempt to reduce confusion and change since any deviation from routines can be frightening. "}
