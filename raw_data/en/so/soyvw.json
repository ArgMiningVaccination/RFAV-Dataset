The interaction will cease if one or both person decides that the exchange of benefits and rewards are no longer worthwhile. Transactional Leadership theory also focus on the task that need to be carried out and makes sure they are done the right way as compared to Transformational Leadership theory which focus on staff empowerment (Marquis and Huston, 2015). Collectively, we urge your support for S3111 and respectfully ask for the bill to be posted for a vote in the Senate Budget Committee. We applaud Senator Gill for the introduction of S3111 and Senator Kean and Beach for signing on as co-sponsors of the bill. S3111 was passed out of the Senate Commerce Committee with unanimous support. We urge the members of the Budget Committee to lend their support for successful passage of S3111. Examples include programs to reduce unnecessary hospital readmissions by coordinating care and services for patients when they leave the hospital. Other provisions provide for the development of Accountable Care Organizations, bundled payments, and medical homes all of which are intended to provider higher-quality, coordinated care for beneficiaries. According to Julia Wood (2004), \"communication is a systemic process in which individuals interact with and through symbols to create and interpret meanings. However, Sheppard (1993) suggests that, in the nurse-patient relationship, communication involves more than the transmission of information; it also involves transmitting feelings, recognizing these feelings and letting the patient know that their feelings have been recognized (M, 1993)\". It is a two way process. The patient conveys their fears and concerns to their nurse and helps them make a correct nursing diagnosis. An excellent communication skill between nurses and patients is essential for the successful outcome of individualized nursing care of each patient. The ability to communicate The Institute of Medicine focuses on patient safety in order to promote policies and best practices that create safe and high-quality health care environments. Developing a pre-community discharge program would impact patient safety and quality of care both in the facility and post discharge for optimal safety and success in the community setting. The steps required to ensure quality of life in the community, relies heavily on a pre-discharge plan. [Here, a comma separates the subject from its verb and the rest of the sentence. This can confuse the reader by creating a false break in the idea. What can you omit to fix this?] This plan will focus on a set time frame School-reentry is a major issue for children who have been hospitalized for an extended period of time or who have had intensive medical treatments, such as patients in a major pediatric cancer treatment center. A hospital-school transition program for children being discharged from the hospital is beneficial for both patients/families and the school systems. One last component includes socioeconomic status of Black individuals. Those with lower income and educational levels have poorer lifestyle choices than those of higher levels (Walker, 2012). A huge problem that contributes to negative overall health in Black Americans is a lack of adequate insurance. Those of lower economic status are less likely to have insurance, and therefore less likely to receive treatment for medical problems. Even when an individual has insurance, many private insurance plans have very high out-of-pocket expenses that may deter individuals from seeing a doctor or from following up a new prescription medication (Walker, 2012). Complications may arise due to medications being discontinued abruptly and without physician's approval. The United States population continues to grow and changes and individuals from different backgrounds move here. In the next several years we will see an increases in certain populations. We are starting to see a change in our patient population as individuals from different populations are seeking medical assistance. The Chinese American culture is one that is continuing to gown in here in the US. For this weeks post I will discuss the Chinese American culture and the culture impacts on caring for them. I will also review the case study in completing this post. Transition of care is vital part of recovering from any type of surgery. It can be detrimental to the patient's health if all of the necessary steps and parties involved are not in proper sequence. Transition of care is a vulnerable time for all patients, but especially older patients and those with comorbidities. Transition of care is the coordination of care of patients transferring from different levels of care which include hospital admission through discharge, skilled nursing facilities, long-term care facilities, assisted living facilities, home health care agencies, primary care physicians, specialist, and care takers at home (National Transitions of Care Coalition, n.d.). This paper will outline the downfalls of transition of care The patients experience within the hospital is collected from a survey done randomly among patients. Each hospital must have at least 300 survey responses per year. After collecting the data, the data is submitted to the survey data warehouse, where it is analyzed and adjusted to truly reflect the hospital's conditions. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services along with the Agency for healthcare research standardize the survey results with the hospital consumer assessment of healthcare providers and systems survey. This survey has only thirty-two questions which are analyzed each year. It is given to patients randomly throughout the year, collected by those who receive training in giving the survey. Some questions that are asked are in the category of composite topics which include; nurse communication, doctor communication, responsiveness of hospital staff, pain management, questions about medications, discharge information, and cleanliness of the hospital. This is all done to show the patient the true quality of the hospital, and the general effect on the Hospital Readmission has a high burden to both healthcare systems and patients. Most readmission is thought to be related to the quality of healthcare system. In the US, nearly 20 percent of Medicare patients are readmitted within 30 days after discharge and related with an estimated annual cost of 17 billion (1). Hospital readmission for patients early after an inpatient stay can be a traumatic experience (2). Prescribing medications to patients is a part of the advanced practice registered nurse's (ARNP) role. As I started Advanced Pharmacology a few short eleven weeks ago, I did not realize how much more there was to that \"simple\" task. As I reflect on my journey through Advanced Pharmacology, I will share with you a few important facts about my journey, such as how my expectations of prescribing changed, any ah ha moments I had, what I felt to be the most significant piece of knowledge I acquired and finally what I think about Florida's approved medication schedule for ARNPs. Implementation of an EHR system initially can be frustrating and require time to learn how to use. In this case, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) seems to have gone through such a stage. To begin, not only did they need to learn a new system, but they also had to deal with the increase in patient volume from the H1N1 pandemic. While attempting to compensate for the learning curve and changes with implementation of the EHR, CCHMC added staffing and an overflow clinic in order to deal with the increased patient volumes, lower the length of stay (LOS), and lower the time with providers. Despite their best efforts, LOS and time with providers increased quite a bit with both reaching between 6%-22% longer than before implementation. Patient and family centered care is a move towards to the planning, delivery, and evaluation of health care that is based on equally advantageous partnerships among health care providers, patients, and families. Every patient is handed-over to the next set of clinical staff at the start of every shift. This is to ensure the patient get conternuaty* of care and is always getting the best care possible. It also means everyone understands the plan and end goals for the patient as well as there "}
