The present invention relates to vaccines comprising at least one mRNA encoding at least one antigen for use in the treatment of a disease in newborns and/or infants, preferably exhibiting an age of not more than 2 years, preferably of not more than 1 year, more preferably of not more than 9 months or even 6 months, wherein the treatment comprises vaccination of the newborn or infant and eliciting an immune response in said newborn or infant. The present invention is furthermore directed to kits and kits of parts comprising such a vaccine and/or its components and to methods applying such a vaccine or kit. Diagnosing, preventing and treating infections and allergies in newborns and infants are of major interest and increasingly the subject of intense research worldwide. In this context, a profound knowledge about the mechanisms of the immune system of newborns and infants is of major importance. As widely known, the primary role of the immune system is to protect the organism against pathogens, but the response of the immune system to such pathogens is not equal throughout the whole life span. It is further known that responses of the immune system undergo age-associated alterations. Likewise, responses of the immune system of newborns and infants are not equal to those of adults. Particularly the response of T and B cells differs in many aspects, a fact, which may be contributed to the necessity of the prenatal requirements of the fetal immune system and the transition to the external conditions during birth. As is well known, all organ systems of the body undergo a dramatic transition during birth from a sheltered intra-uterine existence to the radically distinct environment of the outside world. This acute transition is then followed by a gradual, age-dependent maturation. As reviewed by Ofer (see Ofer, NATURE REVIEWS|IMMUNOLOGY VOLUME 7|MAY 2007|379) the fetal and neonatal immune systems are usually associated with physiological demands that are three-fold: protection against infection, including viral and bacterial pathogens at the maternal-fetal interface, avoidance of potentially harmful pro-inflammatory/T helper 1 (Th1)-cell polarizing responses that can induce alloimmune reactions between mother and fetus, and mediation of the transition between the normally sterile intra-uterine environment to the foreign antigen-rich environment of the outside world, including primary colonization of the skin and intestinal tract by microorganisms. Given the limited exposure to antigens in utero and the well-described defects in neonatal adaptive immunity, newborns must rely on their innate immune systems for protection to a significant extent. As the innate immune system can instruct the adaptive immune response, distinct functional expression of neonatal innate immunity, including a bias against Th1-cell-polarizing cytokines, contributes to a distinct pattern of neonatal adaptive immune responses. Mounting evidence indicates that infection-induced production of pro-inflammatory/Th1 cell-polarizing cytokines, including tumour-necrosis factor (TNF) interleukin-1 (IL-1) is associated with premature labour and pre-term delivery. In particular, TNF production is thought to favour abortion through the induction of apoptosis in placental and fetal cells. The ability of pro-inflammatory cytokines to induce spontaneous abortion is likely to be an important reason for the strong bias of the maternal and fetal immune systems of multiple mammalian species towards TH2-cell-polarizing cytokines (see Levy, 2007, supra). Because of this impaired production of Th1 cell associated cytokines, it was initially thought that the neonatal innate immune system was generally impaired or depressed; however, stimulus-induced production of certain cytokines (for example, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-23) by neonatal monocytes and antigen presenting cells (APCs) actually exceeds that of adults (see Angelone, D. et al., Pediatr. Res. 60, 205-209 (2006); Vanden Eijnden, S., Goriely, S., De Wit, D., Goldman, M. & Willems, F. Eur. J. Immunol. 36, 21-26, (2006); Chelvarajan, R. L. et al., J. Leukoc. Biol. 75, 982-994 (2004)). Nevertheless, there still appears to be a bias against Th1 cell-polarizing cytokines, which leaves the newborn susceptible to microbial infections and contributes to the impairment of neonatal immune responses to most vaccines, thereby frustrating efforts to protect this vulnerable population. After birth, there is an age-dependent maturation of the immune response. Of note, prenatal and postnatal exposure to environmental microbial products that can activate innate immunity might accelerate this maturation process, particularly if the exposure occurs repeatedly over time, diminishing TH2-cell polarization and/or enhancing Th1 cell polarization and thereby potentially reducing allergy and atopy, in accord with the hygiene hypothesis (see again Levy, 2007, supra). T cell mediated immune responses in early life, particularly in newborns, have been reviewed by Marchant and Goldmann (see Marchant and Goldmann, Clinical and Experimental Immunology, 2005, 14: 10-18). As stated there circulating neonatal T lymphocytes are fundamentally different from na\u00efve adult T cells and have characteristics of recent thymic emigrants. They contain high concentrations of T cell-receptor excision circles (TRECs), episomal DNA by products of TCR-chain rearrangement that are not replicated but diluted during cell division. Like adult na\u00efve cells, most neonatal T lymphocytes express the and the adult na\u00efve lymphocytes, neonatal lymphocytes express the CD38 molecule. In addition, a high proportion of circulating neonatal T cells are in cycle and display an increased susceptibility to apoptosis indicating high cell turn-over. Proliferation of na\u00efve T lymphocytes can also be detected during fetal life and could last up to five years of age. The high cell turn-over observed in early life probably plays a central role in the establishment of the T cell repertoire. Despite their high turn-over, T cells preserve long telomeric sequences through a high constitutive telomerase activity. In vitro apoptosis of neonatal T lymphocytes can be prevented by cytokines signalling through the -chain of the IL-2 receptor, namely IL-2, IL-4, IL-7 and IL-15. Among these cytokines, IL-7 and IL-15 also induce the proliferation of neonatal T lymphocytes in the absence of other stimuli. IL-7 is involved in thymocyte development at a stage preceding the T cell receptor rearrangement. IL-15 preferentially stimulates the proliferation of CD8 rather than CD4+ T cells. In contrast to IL-7, IL-15 induces the differentiation of CD8+ T lymphocytes in vitro (see Marchant and Goldmann, 2005, supra). Several mechanisms limit T helper 1 (Th1) type responses in early life. In utero, Th1 responses are toxic to the placenta and are inhibited by trophoblast-derived IL-10 and progesterone. At birth, Th1 responses are still of lower magnitude than later in life. In vitro, CD4+ T cells of newborns produce lower levels of IFN than na\u00efve T cells of adults and are hypermethylated at CpG and non-CpG sites within the IFN promoter. In the presence of suboptimal CD28 costimulation, IL-12 stimulates the production IFN by neonatal CD4 T lymphocytes whereas adult cells do not produce IL-4 under similar conditions. In response to polyclonal or superantigen activation, postnatal thymocytes develop into Th2 cytokine producing CD4 cells whereas IL-12 is required to stimulate the production of IFN. In contrast, neonatal CD8+ T cells produce similar levels of IFN and have a pattern of IFN promoter methylation comparable to that of na\u00efve adult cells. In addition, neonatal CD8 T lymphocytes are strictly dependent on the presence of IL-4 at the time of priming to differentiate into IL-4-producing cells. The capacity of neonatal CD4 T lymphocytes to express CD40 ligand (CD154), a molecule playing a critical role in the help to B lymphocytes and CD8+ T cells, remains controversial (see also Marchant and Goldmann, 2005, supra). Together, the available data indicate that na\u00efve T lymphocytes are differently programmed in neonates and in adults. As may be summarized, the capacity of neonatal CD4+ T cells to produce IFN and of neonatal DCs to promote Th1 responses is lower as compared to adults in in vitro studies. Additionally, Th1 responses to a number of vaccines and infectious pathogens in vivo are poor during early life. However, mature Th1 responses can develop in certain conditions such as neonatal BCG vaccination and Bordetella pertussis infection, probably in relation with a more efficient activation of DCs. Accordingly, the classical paradigm that newborns have incompetent T lymphocytes developing only weak or even tolerogenic responses has to be reconsidered. The observation that mature cellular immune responses can be developed in early life suggests that under appropriate conditions of stimulation neonatal T lymphocytes may be instructed to fight intracellular pathogens (see also Marchant and Goldmann, 2005, supra). Not only differences in T cell responses but also differences in B cell responses appear to exhibit a severe impact on immunoprotection in newborns and/or infants with respect to adult individuals. It has long been thought that the vulnerability of children younger than 18-24 months of age to encapsulated bacteria such as pneumococcus, Haemophilus influenzae B (Hib) and meningococcus has long been thought to reflect a general failure to generate T cell-independent B cell responses to most bacterial polysaccharides (see Claire-Anne Siegrist* and Richard Aspinall, NATURE REVIEWS|IMMUNOLOGY VOLUME 9|MARCH 2009|185). However, immaturity of the immune system in newborns and/or infants also has a direct effect on the magnitude of antibody responses to T cell-dependent protein antigens. Mechanisms that shape B cell responses in early life were investigated using neonatal mouse immunization models that were developed to reproduce the main limitations of immune responses to vaccines that are administered at an early age (see Claire-Anne Siegrist* and Richard Aspinall, 2009, supra). There are numerous differences between neonatal and adult mouse splenic B cells, although fewer differences have been identified by comparing human peripheral B cells. Specifically, human neonatal B cells express lower levels of the co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD80 and CD86, which CD40 (CD40L) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) expressed by T cells. Splenic marginal zone infant B cells express lower levels of CD21, which limits their capacity to respond to polysaccharide-complement complexes. The expression of TACI (transmembrane activator and interactor; also known as TNFRSF13B), an important co-stimulatory receptor, is also decreased on both neonatal mouse and neonatal human B cells, particularly those born prematurely. In addition, B cell responses in early life are influenced by numerous extrinsic factors. Antibodies of maternal origin bind to vaccine antigens in an epitope specific manner and therefore prevent infant B cells from accessing immunodominant vaccine epitopes. Furthermore, human and mouse neonates have low levels of serum complement component C3, which limits their responses to antigen-C3d complexes. The human spleen contains fewer marginal zone macrophages (which have a crucial role in the induction of an antibody response through the trapping of particulate antigens) in neonates than in adults, and the cells differ in their capacity to produce cytokines. In infant mice, B cell responses are limited by a marked delay in the maturation of the follicular dendritic cell (FDC) network, resulting from the failure of FDC precursors to respond to B cell-mediated lymphotoxin- signalling. FDCs nucleate germinal centre reactions by attracting antigen-specific B cells, retain antigens in the form of immune complexes that are highly stimulatory to B cells and provide signals that lead to somatic hypermutation and class-switch recombination. The immaturity of the FDC network therefore delays the induction and limits the magnitude of germinal centre responses, even when potent adjuvants that induce adult-like B cell, T cell and DC activation patterns are used. Additional to the postnatal maturation of antibody responses, the antibody persistence in vivo exhibits an important effect. The long-term maintenance of specific antibodies with a short half-life requires the persistence of antibody-producing B cells, which can either be continually produced from a pool of memory B cells or can persist as long-lived plasma cells. Antibody mediated depletion of memory B cells, which does not affect plasma cells, has shown that the plasma-cell stage is independent of the memory B cell pool. It has also been shown, that persistence of antibodies in vivo may be influenced by environmental factors. This supports the hypothesis that the limited persistence of antibody responses in early life results from exposure to a large load of environmental antigens, which results in competition for access to a limited set of plasma-cell survival niches in the bone marrow (see Claire-Anne Siegrist* and Richard Aspinall, 2009, supra). As known before, the administration of a single dose of vaccine at birth can fail to elicit specific antibodies while priming for subsequent secondary responses, which indicates a preferential neonatal differentiation pathway towards memory B cells rather than plasma cells. Several factors seem to contribute to this B cell differentiation pattern. The fate of antigen-specific naive B cells and their differentiation to short-lived plasma cells, long-lived plasma cells or memory B cells is controlled by early B cell activation signals. High-affinity B cells are actively recruited to the plasma-cell pool, whereas moderate-affinity B cells remain as memory B cells in the secondary lymphoid organs. So, decreased initial B cell receptor affinity and/or delayed affinity maturation of neonatal naive B cells might decrease the strength of the signal and favour memory B cell differentiation. The limited expression of CD21 by infant B cells also supports the generation of memory B cells and impairs the development of plasma cells, which would be supported by CD40-mediated signalling, cytokines such as Il-21 and interactions with ligands such as B cell activating factor (BAFF; also known as TNFSF13B) and APRIL. Remarkably, these plasma-cell-supporting factors are all expressed at low levels early in life, unless additional activation signals are provided to enhance DC and T cell activation. Furthermore, early-life B cells might have to compete for limited resources within the germinal centre, which impairs antibody responses. Plasma-cell differentiation may thus be 'forced' in early life by providing additional DC activation signals. Therefore, a combination of factors appears to result in the preferential differentiation of early-life B cells towards memory B cells instead of long-lived plasma cells in a pattern. Importantly, although it has been shown that the memory B cell pool can be formed early in life, this should not be considered as evidence that its magnitude or persistence is similar to that elicited in immunologically mature hosts. Recent observations of the failure of booster vaccines to elicit a memory response in adolescents or young adults that had been primed against hepatitis B virus in infancy suggest that infant-triggered memory B cells might not last life long. Whether this reflects a smaller B cell pool in infants and/or the influence of as yet undefined homeostatic factors remains to be determined. In summary, a large number of B cell intrinsic factors and extrinsic determinants appear to cooperate to limit the induction and the persistence of antibody-secreting plasma cells in early life, while supporting the preferential induction of memory B cell responses (see Claire-Anne Siegrist* and Richard Aspinall, 2009, supra). Alterations in T cell responses and also in B cell responses as discussed above exhibit a significant effect not only on immunoprotection towards pathogens but also to vaccination strategies in newborns and/or infants when combating infectious diseases but possibly also allergies, autoimmune disorders or further diseases. Many attempts have been carried out to provide efficient vaccines, which may overcome at least some of the above limitations. One previous approach to overcome theses deficiencies in the context of virus-based influenza vaccines refers to the administration of naked DNA plasmid (pHA) expressing hemagglutinin (HA) from the neurovirulent strain A/WSN/33 of influenza virus to prime protective immune responses by inoculating newborn and adult mice (see Bot et al, 1997, International Immunology, Vol. 9, No. 11, pp. 1641-1650). As shown by Bot et al. (1997) continuous exposure to small doses of antigen subsequent to neonatal DNA immunization may lead to priming of specific B and Th cells, rather than tolerance induction. However, only pHA immunization of adult mice primed a strongly biased Th1 response, whereas in neonates it induced a mixed Th1/Th2 response. One further very similar approach of the same working group was directed to the combined administration of plasmids expressing nucleoprotein (NP) or hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza virus. Neonatal immunization of BALB/c mice was followed by priming of B cells, Th cells and CTL rather than tolerance (see Bot et al., Vaccine, Vol. 16, No. 17, pp. 16751682, 1998). However, protection in terms of survival against lethal challenge with homologous or heterologous strains was not reported to be complete. Further, in the case of NP expressing plasmid, the protective immunity elicited by neonatal immunization required a longer time to develop, as compared with adult immunization. Neither Bot et al. (1997, supra) nor Bot et al. (1998, supra) showed good Th1 responses in neonates. Furthermore, even though it was stressed in both papers that DNA vaccination represents an efficient and safe means to generate broad humoral and cellular immune responses to influenza viruses during the earliest stages of postnatal life, DNA has been encountered meanwhile as dangerous due to unwanted insertion into the genome. Such DNA based vaccinations may even lead to interruption of functional genes and cancer or the formation of anti-DNA antibodies and are therefore out of focus as of today. Further approaches were directed to improvement of delivery systems and administration of immunomodulators to optimize vaccine responses in early life. Jiri Kovarik and Claire-Anne Siegrist focus on problems arising from the attempt to vaccinate against pathogens very early in life and on the role of selective adjuvants that could be used to: (i) rapidly induce strong antibody responses of the appropriate isotypes; (ii) elicit sustained antibody responses extending beyond infancy; (iii) induce efficient Th1 and CTL responses in spite of the preferential Th2 polarization of early life responses; (iv) escape from maternal antibody mediated inhibition of vaccine responses; (v) show acceptable reactogenicity in early life; and (vi) allow incorporation of several vaccine antigens into a single formulation so as to reduce the number of required injections (see Jiri Kovarik and Claire-Anne Siegrist, Immunology and Cell Biology Kovarik and Siegrist (1998, supra) inter alia discuss different antigen delivery systems such as administration of particulate substances, emulsions, liposomes, virosomes, microspheres, live vaccines, vectors and DNA vaccines as well as the use of immunomodulators such as MPL, QS21, MDP derivatives, cytokines, interferons, and CpG oligodesoxynucleotides and combinations of antigen presentation systems and immunomodulators. However, as likewise shown in Kovarik and Siegrist (1998, supra) many of these combinations are hypothetical and may not even provide an efficient Th1 response or even lead to unwanted side effects. Similarly, Adrian Bot and Constantin Bona (see Adrian Bot and Constantin Bona, Microbes and Infection 4 (2002) 511-520) suggest the use of bacterial CpG motifs to activate immature antigen-presenting cells and to enhance neonatal immunogenicity of DNA vaccines. Additionally, Bot and Bona (2002, supra) suggest a combination with subsequent boosting using conventional vaccines. Nevertheless, the strategy outlined in this paper does not lead to convincing Th1 responses. Furthermore, the approach is based on the use of DNA vaccine, which may be regarded as potentially dangerous as outlined above. A further promising but very specific strategy relies on the use of the specific novel adjuvant IC31. As known in the art, there are only few adjuvants approved for human use. One major adjuvant approved for human use is e.g. Alum, an aluminium salt based adjuvant. However, although approved for human use, such aluminium salts failed to provide satisfactory augmentation of immune responses for seasonal influenza vaccines in early human clinical trials, an effect, which may be expected likewise during other vaccination strategies. Further licensed adjuvanted influenza vaccines include to date FLUAD\u00ae (Novartis Vaccines), containing MF59 in combination with a subunit vaccine formulation, and the virosomal vaccines INFLEXAL\u00aeV (Berna Biotech, a Crucell company) and INVIVAC\u00ae (Solvay). Although animal studies and human clinical trials revealed a higher immunogenicity profile\u2014defined as increased antibody responses\u2014with the MF59-adjuvanted influenza vaccine, MF59 is not a potent adjuvant for the induction of type 1 driven cellular immune responses. Unlike FLUAD\u00ae, the virosomal vaccines represent reconstituted influenza virus envelopes containing the functional influenza surface proteins haemagglutinin and neuraminidase in their phospholipid bilayer. The immunogenicity and local tolerability of virosome-based influenza vaccines has been shown in several studies. However, the development of virosomal formulations is very complex and the costs of goods are high. In this context, Kamath et al. (see Kamath et al., 2008, PLoS ONE 3(11): e3683. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0003683) report the use of a specific adjuvant IC31 with Ag85b-ESAT-6 fusion protein for immunization of neonatal mice and adult mice. Conversely to Alum, IC31H induced strong Th1 and Th17 responses in both age groups, characterized by multifunctional T cells expressing IL-2 and TNF with or without IFN. In the draining lymph nodes, a similarly small number of DC contained the adjuvant and/or the antigen following neonatal or adult immunization. Expression of CD40, CD80, CD86 and IL-12p40 production was focused on the minute adjuvant-bearing DC population, wherein DC targeting/activation was similar in adults and neonates. These DC/T cell responses resulted in an equivalent reduction of bacterial growth following infection with M. bovis BCG, whereas no protection was observed when Alum was used as adjuvant. However, no further adjuvants are shown in Kamath et al. (2008, supra), which allow extension of this specific example to other vaccines. Summarizing the above, none of the present prior art vaccines allow to efficiently evoke immune responses in newborns and/or infants, which show at least similar characteristics as an immune response in adults. Particularly, many vaccines fail to provide an efficient Th1 immune response in newborns and/or infants. Accordingly, there is an urgent need for vaccines optimized for such patients. More precisely, vaccines are required, which do not bear the problems shown in the prior art or at least diminish these problems to a significant extent. Furthermore, it is highly envisaged to provide vaccines, which allow inducing Th1 immune responses in newborns and/or infants, preferably without leading to a shift from Th1 to Th2 immune responses subsequent to administration. Likewise, the administration of DNA based vaccines should be avoided due to possible insertion of DNA into the genome, possible interruption of genes and formation of anti-DNA antibodies. The object underlying the present invention is solved by the subject matter of the attached claims, more preferably as outlined in the following. According to a first embodiment, the object underlying the present invention is solved by a vaccine comprising at least one mRNA encoding at least one antigen for use in the prophylaxis and/or treatment of a disease in newborns and/or infants, preferably exhibiting an age of not more than 2 years, preferably of not more than 1 year, more preferably of not more than 9 months or even 6 months, wherein the treatment comprises vaccination of the newborn or young infant and eliciting an immune response in said newborn or infant. Without being bound to theory RNA vaccines elegantly integrate adjuvanticity and antigen expression, thereby mimicking relevant aspects of viral infections. This increases their efficacy compared to other inactivated (dead) vaccines that require the use of advanced adjuvants in a newborn or an infant, simplifying handling and production. RNA can address a range of dedicated immunologic pattern recognition receptors, including toll-like receptors 3, 7, and 8, RIG-I, MDA5, PKR, and others that may act synergistically and serve to enhance the induction of antigen-specific adaptive B and T cell responses. Importantly, by antigen synthesis in transfected host cells, mRNA vaccines directly introduce antigen into cellular antigen processing and presentation pathways, granting access to MHC molecules and triggering T cell responses, irrespective of the hosts MHC haplotype. This enables the induction of polyclonal T cell responses that may act synergistically with other immune responses, including B cells. Also, presenting the full spectrum of MHC-binding epitopes may circumvent limitations by immature immune systems in a newborn or an infant. Also, endogenous production of antigen ensures faithful posttranslational modification (e.g. proteolytic processing, glycosylation, etc.) that may positively impact immunogenicity. Also, RNA vaccines exhibit safety features that make them superior for use in newborns and/or infants. For example, the increased reactogenicity of live attenuated vaccines generally prevents use in this highly relevant target group. However, considering the short persistence and traceless decay of the vaccine vector within a matter of days the observed good immunogenicity is unexpected and contrasts claims for plasmid DNA vaccines that variously linked efficacy to the persistent expression of antigen. The at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine as defined in the first embodiment of the present invention, encoding at least one antigen, may be selected from any antigen, known to a skilled person, preferably suitable to elicit an antigen-specific immune response in a patient. According to the present invention, the term \"antigen\" refers to a substance which is recognized by the immune system and is capable of triggering an antigen-specific immune response, e.g. by formation of antibodies or antigen-specific T cells as part of an adaptive immune response. In this context, the first step of an adaptive immune response is the activation of na\u00efve antigen-specific T cells or different immune cells able to induce an antigen-specific immune response by antigen-presenting cells. This occurs in the lymphoid tissues and organs through which na\u00efve T cells are constantly passing. The three cell types that can serve as antigen-presenting cells are dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. Each of these cells has a distinct function in eliciting immune responses. Tissue dendritic cells take up antigens by phagocytosis and macropinocytosis and are stimulated by contact with e.g. a foreign antigen to migrate to the local lymphoid tissue, where they differentiate into mature dendritic cells. Macrophages ingest particulate antigens such as bacteria and are induced by infectious agents or other appropriate stimuli to express MHC molecules. The unique ability of B cells to bind and internalize soluble protein antigens via their receptors may also be important to induce T cells. Presenting the antigen on MHC molecules leads to activation of T cells which induces their proliferation and differentiation into armed effector T cells. The most important function of effector T cells is the killing of infected cells by CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and the activation of macrophages by Th1 cells which together make up cell-mediated immunity, and the activation of B cells by both TH2 and Th1 cells to produce different classes of antibody, thus driving the humoral immune response. T cells recognize an antigen by their T cell receptors which do not recognize and bind antigen directly, but instead recognize short peptide fragments e.g. of pathogens' protein antigens, which are bound to MHC molecules on the surfaces of other cells. In the context of the present invention, antigens as encoded by the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine typically comprise any antigen, falling under the above definition, more preferably protein and peptide antigens. In accordance with the invention, antigens as encoded by the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine may be antigens generated outside the cell, more typically antigens not derived from the host organism (e.g. a human) itself (i.e. non-self antigens) but rather derived from host cells outside the host organism, e.g. pathogenic antigens, particularly viral antigens, bacterial antigens, fungal antigens, protozoological antigens, animal antigens (preferably from or organisms as disclosed herein), allergy antigens, etc. Antigens as encoded by the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine may be furthermore antigens generated inside the cell, the tissue or the body, e.g. by secretion of proteins, their degradation, metabolism, etc. Such antigens include antigens derived from the host organism (e.g. a human) itself, e.g. tumour antigens, self-antigens or auto-antigens, such as auto-immune self-antigens, etc., but also (non-self) antigens as defined above, which have been originally been derived from host cells outside the host organism, but which are fragmented or degraded inside the body, tissue or cell, e.g. by (protease) degradation, metabolism, etc. Pathogenic antigens particularly comprise e.g. antigens from influenza, preferably influenza A, influenza B, influenza C or thogotovirus, preferably influenza antigens haemagglutinin (HA) and/or neuraminidase (NA), any further combination, or from matrix protein 1 (M1), ion channel protein M2 (M2), nucleoprotein (NP), etc; or e.g. antigens from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), including F-protein, G-protein, etc. One further class of antigens as encoded by the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine comprises allergy antigens. Allergy antigens are typically antigens, which cause an allergy in a human and may be derived from either a human or other sources. Such allergy antigens may be selected from antigens derived from different sources, e.g. from animals, plants, fungi, bacteria, etc. Allergens in this context also include antigens derived from e.g. grasses, pollens, molds, drugs, or numerous environmental triggers, etc. Allergy antigens typically belong to different classes of compounds, such as proteins or peptides and their fragments, carbohydrates, polysaccharides, sugars, lipids, phospholipids, etc. Of particular interest in the context of the present invention are antigens, which are encoded by the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine, i.e. protein or peptide antigens and their fragments or epitopes, or nucleic acids and their fragments, particularly nucleic acids and their fragments, encoding such protein or peptide antigens and their fragments or epitopes.

Tumour antigens may also be selected from proteins, which are overexpressed in tumour cells compared to a normal cell. Furthermore, tumour antigens also include antigens expressed in cells which are (were) not themselves (or originally not themselves) degenerated but are associated with the supposed tumour. Antigens which are connected with tumour-supplying vessels or (re)formation thereof; in particular those antigens which are associated with neovascularization, e.g. growth factors, such as VEGF, bFGF etc., are also included herein. Antigens connected with a tumour furthermore include antigens from cells or tissues, typically embedding the tumour. Further, some substances (usually proteins or peptides) are expressed in patients suffering (knowingly or not-knowingly) from a cancer disease and they occur in increased concentrations in the body fluids of said patients. These substances are also referred to as \"tumour antigens\", however they are not antigens in the stringent meaning of an immune response inducing substance. The class of tumour antigens can be divided further into tumour-specific antigens (TSAs) tumour-associated-antigens (TAAs). TSAs can only be presented by tumour cells and never by normal \"healthy\" cells. They typically result from a tumour specific mutation. TAAs, which are more common, are usually presented by both tumour and healthy cells. These antigens are recognized and the antigen-presenting cell can be destroyed by cytotoxic T cells. Additionally, tumour antigens can also occur on the surface of the tumour in the form of, e.g., a mutated receptor. In this case, they can be recognized by antibodies. According to the invention, the terms \"cancer diseases\" and \"tumour diseases\" are used synonymously herein. Examples of tumour antigens as encoded by the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine may comprise e.g. antigens selected from the group comprising, without being limited (G antigen 2), GAGE-3 (G antigen 3), GAGE-4 (G antigen 4), GAGE-5 (G antigen 5), GAGE-6 (G antigen 6), GAGE-7b (G antigen 7b), GAGE-8 (G antigen 8), GDEP (gene differentially expressed T cells-1/melanoma antigen A), MART-2 (melanoma antigen recognized by T cells-2), protein 22, hyaluronic acid mediated motility), RU1 (renal ubiquitous 1), RU2 (renal ubiquitous 1), S-100, antigen), SART-1 1), SCC tumour gene), or may comprise e.g. mutant antigens expressed in cancer diseases selected from the group comprising, without being limited thereto, alpha-actinin-4/m, gene6/acute (fibronectin 1), GPNMB/m, HLA-A*0201-R170I (arginine to isoleucine exchange at residue 170 of the alpha-helix of the alpha2-domain in the HLA-A2 gene), II), TPI/m (triosephosphate isomerase). According been complexed with or stabilized with protamine (e.g. in a ratio of about 80 g mRNA and 128 g protamine), may be excluded from the scope of invention. In a preferred aspect the tumour antigens as encoded by the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine are selected from the group consisting of particularly preferred aspect, tumour antigens as encoded by the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine are selected from the group consisting of MAGE-A1 (e.g. MAGE-A1 according to accession number survivin according to accession number CEA according to accession number Her-2/neu according to accession growth factor receptor 1) (e.g. EGFRI (epidermal growth factor receptor 1) according to accession number mucin-1 accession PCA, PSA, PSMA, etc. Particularly preferred, antigens are selected from Influenza A virus (HA, NA, NP, M2, M1 antigens), influenza B virus (HA, NA antigens), respiratory syncytial virus (F, G, aureus (toxin antigen), Clostridium difficile (toxin antigen), (acute albicans, Haemophilus influenzae B (HiB), poliovirus, hepatitis antigens), human papillomavirus antigens), Pertussis ama1, msp142 antigens), Staphylococcus (IsdA, toxin), Bordetella CSP protein, ssp2, ama1, msp142 antigens) Antigens as encoded by the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine may furthermore comprise fragments of such antigens as mentioned herein, particularly of protein or peptide antigens. Fragments of such antigens in the context of the present invention may comprise fragments preferably having a length of about 6 to about 20 or even more amino acids, e.g. fragments as processed and presented by MHC class I molecules, preferably having a length of about 8 to about 10 amino acids, e.g. 8, 9, or 10, (or even 11, or 12 amino acids), or fragments as processed and presented by MHC class II molecules, preferably having a length of about 13 or more amino acids, e.g. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 or even more amino acids, wherein these fragments may be selected from any part of the amino acid sequence. These fragments are typically recognized by T cells in form of a complex consisting of the peptide fragment and an MHC molecule, i.e. the fragments are typically not recognized in their native form. Fragments of antigens as defined herein may also comprise epitopes of those antigens. Epitopes (also called \"antigen determinants\") are typically fragments located on the outer surface of (native) protein or peptide antigens as defined herein, preferably having 5 to 15 amino acids, more preferably having 5 to 12 amino acids, even more preferably having 6 to 9 amino acids, which may be recognized by antibodies, i.e. in their native form. According to a further particularly preferred aspect, the tumour antigens as encoded by at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine may form a cocktail of antigens, e.g. in an active (immunostimulatory) composition or a kit of parts (wherein preferably each antigen is contained in one part of the kit), preferably for eliciting an (adaptive) immune response for the treatment of a disease or disorder as defined herein. For this purpose, the inventive vaccine may comprise at least one mRNA, wherein each mRNA may encode at least one, preferably two, three, four or even more (preferably different) antigens as mentioned herein. Alternatively, the inventive vaccine may contain at least one, two, three, four or even more (preferably different) mRNAs, wherein each mRNA encodes at least one antigen as mentioned herein. Such a cocktail of antigens, as encoded by the least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine may be used e.g. in the treatment of e.g. prostate cancer (PCa), preferably in the treatment of neoadjuvant and/or hormone-refractory prostate cancers, and diseases or disorders related thereto. For this purpose, the inventive vaccine may comprise at least one mRNA, wherein each mRNA may encode at least one, preferably two, three, four or even more (preferably different) antigens as mentioned herein. Alternatively, the inventive vaccine may contain at least one, two, three, four or even more (preferably different) mRNAs, wherein each mRNA encodes at least one antigen as mentioned herein. Preferably, the antigens are selected from PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen)=KLK3 (Kallikrein-3), PSMA (Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen), PSCA (Prostate Stem Cell Antigen), and/or STEAP (Six Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of the Prostate). Furthermore, such a cocktail of antigens, as encoded by the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine may be used in the treatment of e.g. non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), preferably selected from the three main sub-types squamous cell lung carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and large cell lung carcinoma, or of disorders related thereto. For this purpose, the inventive vaccine may comprise at least one mRNA, wherein each mRNA may encode at least one, preferably two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten eleven or twelve (preferably different) antigens as mentioned herein. Alternatively, the inventive vaccine may contain at least one, preferably two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven or twelve (preferably different) mRNAs, wherein each mRNA encodes at least one antigen as mentioned herein. Preferably, the above aspects, each of the above defined antigens may be encoded by one (monocistronic) mRNA. In other words, in this case the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine may comprise at least two (three, four, etc.) (monocistronic) mRNAs, wherein each of these at least two (three, four, etc.) (monocistronic) mRNAs may encode, e.g. just one (preferably different) antigen, preferably selected from one of the above mentioned antigen combinations. According to a particularly preferred aspect, the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine may comprise (at least) one bi- or even multicistronic mRNA, preferably mRNA, i.e. (at least) one mRNA which carries, e.g. two or even more of the coding sequences of at least two (preferably different) antigens, preferably selected from one of the above mentioned antigen combinations. Such coding sequences, e.g. of the at least two (preferably different) antigens, of the (at least) one bi- or even multicistronic mRNA may be separated by at least one IRES (internal ribosomal entry site) sequence, as defined below. Thus, the term \"encoding at least two (preferably different) antigens\" may mean, without being limited thereto, that the (at least) one (bi- or even multicistronic) mRNA, may encode e.g. at least two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven or twelve or more (preferably different) antigens of the above mentioned group(s) of antigens, or their fragments or variants, etc. In this context, a so-called IRES (internal ribosomal entry site) sequence as defined herein can function as a sole ribosome binding site, but it can also serve to provide a bi- or even multicistronic RNA as defined herein which codes for several proteins, which are to be translated by the ribosomes independently of one another. Examples of IRES sequences which can be used according to the invention are those from picornaviruses (e.g. FMDV), pestiviruses (CFFV), polioviruses disease viruses (FMDV), hepatitis C viruses (HCV), classical swine fever viruses (CSFV), mouse leukemia virus (MLV), simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) or cricket paralysis viruses (CrPV). According to a further particularly preferred aspect, the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine may comprise a mixture of at least one monocistronic mRNA as defined herein, and at least one bi- or even multicistronic RNA, preferably mRNA, as defined herein. The at least one monocistronic RNA and/or the at least one bi- or even multicistronic RNA preferably encode different antigens, or their fragments or variants, the antigens preferably being selected from one of the above mentioned antigens, more preferably in one of the above mentioned combinations. However, the at least one monocistronic RNA and the at least one bi- or even multicistronic RNA may preferably also encode (in part) identical antigens selected from one of the above mentioned antigens, preferably in one of the above mentioned combinations, provided that the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine as a whole provides at least two (preferably different) antigens, as defined herein. Such an aspect may be advantageous e.g. for a staggered, e.g. time dependent, administration of one or several of the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine to a patient in need thereof. The components of such a vaccine may be contained in (different parts of) a kit of parts composition or may be e.g. administered separately as components of the same inventive vaccine as defined according to the present invention. In a further preferred embodiment the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine (or any further nucleic acid as defined herein) may also occur in the form of a modified nucleic acid. According to a first aspect, the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine (or any further nucleic acid as defined herein) may be provided as a \"stabilized nucleic acid\" that is essentially resistant to in vivo degradation (e.g. by an exo- or endo-nuclease). In this context, the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine (or any further nucleic acid as defined herein) may contain backbone modifications, sugar modifications or base modifications. A backbone modification in connection with the present invention is a modification in which phosphates of the backbone of the nucleotides contained in the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine (or any further nucleic acid as defined herein) are chemically modified. A sugar modification in connection with the present invention is a chemical modification of the sugar of the nucleotides of the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine (or any further nucleic acid as defined herein). Furthermore, a base modification in connection with the present invention is a chemical modification of the base moiety of the nucleotides of the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine (or any further nucleic acid as defined herein). According to a further aspect, the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine (or any further nucleic acid as defined herein) can contain a lipid modification. Such a lipid-modified nucleic acid typically comprises a nucleic acid as defined herein, e.g. an mRNA or any further nucleic acid. Such a lipid-modified mRNA of the inventive vaccine (or any further lipid-modified nucleic acid as defined herein) typically further comprises at least one linker covalently linked with that nucleic acid molecule, and at least one lipid covalently linked with the respective linker. Alternatively, the lipid-modified mRNA of the inventive vaccine (or any further lipid-modified nucleic acid as defined herein) comprises at least one nucleic acid molecule as defined herein, e.g. an mRNA or any further nucleic acid, and at least one (bifunctional) lipid covalently linked (without a linker) with that nucleic acid molecule. According to a third alternative, the lipid-modified mRNA of the inventive vaccine (or any further lipid-modified nucleic acid as defined herein) comprises a nucleic acid molecule as defined herein, e.g. an mRNA or any further nucleic acid, at least one linker covalently linked with that nucleic acid molecule, and at least one lipid covalently linked with the respective linker, and also at least one (bifunctional) lipid covalently linked (without a linker) with that nucleic acid molecule. The at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine (or any further nucleic acid as defined herein) may likewise be stabilized in order to prevent degradation of the mRNA (or any further nucleic acid molecule) by various approaches. It is known in the art that instability and (fast) degradation of RNA in general may represent a serious problem in the application of RNA based compositions. This instability of RNA is typically due to RNA-degrading enzymes, \"RNAases\" (ribonucleases), wherein contamination with such ribonucleases may sometimes completely degrade RNA in solution. Accordingly, the natural degradation of RNA in the cytoplasm of cells is very finely regulated and RNase contaminations may be generally removed by special treatment prior to use of said compositions, in particular with diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC). A number of mechanisms of natural degradation are known in this connection in the prior art, which may be utilized as well. E.g., the terminal structure is typically of critical importance particularly for an mRNA. As an example, at the 5 end of naturally occurring mRNAs there is usually a so-called \"cap structure\" (a modified guanosine nucleotide), and at the 3 end is typically a sequence of up to 200 adenosine nucleotides (the so-called poly-A tail). According to another aspect, the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine may be modified and thus stabilized by modifying the G/C content of the mRNA, preferably of the coding region thereof. In a particularly preferred aspect of the present invention, the G/C content of the coding region of the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine is modified, particularly increased, compared to the G/C content of the coding region of its particular wild type coding sequence, i.e. the unmodified mRNA. The encoded amino acid sequence of the mRNA is preferably not modified compared to the coded amino acid sequence of the particular wild type mRNA. The modification of the G/C-content of the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine is based on the fact that the sequence of any mRNA region to be translated is important for efficient translation of that mRNA. Thus, the composition and the sequence of various nucleotides are important. In particular, sequences having an increased G (guanosine)/C (cytosine) content are more stable than sequences having an increased A (adenosine)/U (uracil) content. According to the invention, the codons of the coding sequence or mRNA are therefore varied compared to its wild type coding sequence or mRNA, while retaining the translated amino acid sequence, such that they include an increased amount of G/C nucleotides. In respect to the fact that several codons code for one and the same amino acid (so-called degeneration of the genetic code), the most favourable codons for the stability can be determined (so-called alternative codon usage). Preferably, the G/C content of the coding region of the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine is increased by at least 7%, more preferably by at least 15%, particularly preferably by at least 20%, compared to the G/C content of the coded region of the wild type mRNA. According to a specific aspect at least 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, more preferably at least 70%, even more preferably at least 80% and most preferably at least 90%, 95% or even 100% of the substitutable codons in the region coding for a protein or peptide as defined herein or its fragment or variant thereof or the whole sequence of the wild type mRNA sequence or coding sequence are substituted, thereby increasing the G/C content of said sequence. In this context, it is particularly preferable to increase the G/C content of the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine to the maximum (i.e. 100% of the substitutable codons), in particular in the region coding for a protein, compared to the wild type sequence. According to the invention, a further preferred modification of the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of an mRNA or codes for an mRNA, is based on the finding that the translation efficiency is also determined by a different frequency in the occurrence of tRNAs in cells. Thus, if so-called \"rare codons\" are present in the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine to an increased extent, the corresponding modified mRNA is translated to a significantly poorer degree than in the case where codons coding for relatively \"frequent\" tRNAs are present. Preferably, the coding region of the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine is modified compared to the corresponding region of the wild type mRNA or coding sequence such that at least one codon of the wild type sequence which codes for a tRNA which is relatively rare in the cell is exchanged for a codon which codes for a tRNA which is relatively frequent in the cell and carries the same amino acid as the relatively rare tRNA. By this modification, the sequences of the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of an mRNA or codes for an mRNA, is modified such that codons for which frequently occurring tRNAs are available are inserted. In other words, according to the invention, by this modification all codons of the wild type sequence which code for a tRNA which is relatively rare in the cell can in each case be exchanged for a codon which codes for a tRNA which is relatively frequent in the cell and which, in each case, carries the same amino acid as the relatively rare tRNA. Which tRNAs occur relatively frequently in the cell and which, in contrast, occur relatively rarely is known to a person skilled in the art; cf. e.g. Akashi, Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001, 11(6): 660-666. The codons which use for the particular amino acid the tRNA which occurs the most frequently, e.g. the Gly codon, which uses the tRNA which occurs the most frequently in the (human) cell, are particularly preferred. According to the invention, it is particularly preferable to link the sequential G/C content which is increased, in particular maximized, in the modified at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine with the \"frequent\" codons without modifying the amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by the coding region of the mRNA. This preferred aspect allows provision of a particularly efficiently translated and stabilized (modified) at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine. According to a further preferred aspect of the invention, the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine as defined herein or any further nucleic acid molecule as defined herein preferably has at least one 5 and/or 3 stabilizing sequence. These stabilizing sequences in the 5 and/or 3 untranslated regions have the effect of increasing the half-life of the nucleic acid in the cytosol. These stabilizing sequences can have 100% sequence identity to naturally occurring sequences which occur in viruses, bacteria and eukaryotes, but can also be partly or completely synthetic. The untranslated sequences (UTR) of the (alpha-)globin gene, e.g. from Homo sapiens or Xenopus laevis may be mentioned as an example of stabilizing sequences which can be used in the present invention for a stabilized nucleic acid. Another example of a stabilizing sequence has the general formula (C/U)CCANxCCC(U/A)PyxUC(C/U)CC (SEQ ID NO: 383), which is contained in the 3UTR of the very stable RNA which codes for (alpha-)globin, type(I)-collagen, 15-lipoxygenase or Acad. 1997, 94: 2410 to 2414). Such stabilizing sequences can of course be used individually or in combination with one another and also in combination with other stabilizing sequences known to a person skilled in the art. Nevertheless, substitutions, additions or eliminations of bases are preferably carried out with the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine or any further nucleic acid molecule as defined herein, especially if the nucleic acid is in the form of an mRNA, using a DNA matrix for preparation of the nucleic acid molecule by techniques of the well known site directed mutagenesis or with an oligonucleotide ligation strategy (see e.g. Maniatis et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 3rd ed., Cold Spring Harbor, N Y, 2001). In such a process, for preparation of the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine as defined herein a corresponding DNA molecule may be transcribed in vitro. This DNA matrix preferably comprises a suitable promoter, e.g. a T7 or SP6 promoter, for in vitro transcription, which is followed by the desired nucleotide sequence for the at least one mRNA to be prepared and a termination signal for in vitro transcription. The DNA molecule, which forms the matrix of the at least one mRNA of interest, may be prepared by fermentative proliferation and subsequent isolation as part of a plasmid which can be replicated in bacteria. Plasmids which may be mentioned as suitable for the present invention are e.g. the plasmids pT7 Ts (GenBank accession number Storts, PCR Products, in: Griffin and Griffin (ed.), PCR Technology: Current Innovation, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla., 2001. Nucleic acid molecules used according to the invention and as defined herein, e.g. the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine or any further nucleic acid molecule as defined herein, may be modified as outlined above for the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine. Additionally, nucleic acid molecules used according to the invention and as defined herein, e.g. the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine or any further nucleic acid molecule as defined herein, may be prepared using any method known in the art, including synthetic methods such as e.g. solid phase synthesis, as well as in vitro methods, such as in vitro transcription reactions. According to one preferred aspect of the present invention the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine may be administered naked without being associated with any further vehicle, transfection or complexation agent for increasing the transfection efficiency of the at least one mRNA. In a further preferred aspect of the present invention the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine is associated with a vehicle, transfection or complexation agent for increasing the transfection efficiency of the at least one mRNA. Particularly preferred agents in this context suitable for increasing the transfection efficiency are cationic or polycationic compounds, including protamine, nucleoline, spermine or spermidine, such as poly-L-lysine (PLL), polyarginine, basic polypeptides, cell penetrating peptides (CPPs), peptides, HIV-1 Tat (HIV), Tat-derived peptides, preferred cationic or polycationic proteins or peptides may be selected from the following proteins or peptides having the following total formula: (Arg)l;(Lys)m;(His)n;(Orn)o;(Xaa)x, wherein l+m+n+o+x=8-15, and l, m, n or o independently of each other may be any number selected from 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 or 15, provided that the overall content of Arg, Lys, His and Orn represents at least 50% of all amino acids of the oligopeptide; and Xaa may be any amino acid selected from native (=naturally occurring) or non-native amino acids except of Arg, Lys, His or Orn; and x may be any number selected from 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4, provided, that the overall content of Xaa does not exceed 50% of all amino acids of the oligopeptide. Particularly preferred cationic peptides in this compounds, which can be used as transfection as -aminoacid-polymers or reversed polyamides, etc., modified polyethylenes, such as PVP bromide)), etc., acrylates, such based as PMOXA-PDMS copolymers, etc., blockpolymers consisting of a combination of one or more cationic blocks (e.g. selected from a cationic polymer as mentioned above) and of one or more hydrophilic or hydrophobic blocks (e.g. polyethyleneglycole); etc. The at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine encoding at least one antigen may also be complexed with a polymeric carrier formed by disulfide-crosslinked cationic components. The term \"cationic component\" typically refers to a charged molecule, which is positively charged (cation) at a pH value of about 1 to 9, preferably of a pH value of or below 9, of or below 8, of or below 7, most preferably at physiological pH values, e.g. about 7.3 to 7.4. Accordingly, a cationic peptide, protein or polymer according to the present invention is positively charged under physiological conditions, particularly under physiological salt conditions of the cell in vivo. The definition \"cationic\" may also refer to \"polycationic\" components. In this context the cationic components, which form basis for the polymeric carrier of the inventive vaccine by disulfide-crosslinkage, are typically selected from any suitable cationic or polycationic peptide, protein or polymer suitable for this purpose, particular any cationic or polycationic peptide, protein or polymer capable to complex a nucleic acid as defined according to the present invention, and thereby preferably condensing the nucleic acid. The cationic or polycationic peptide, protein or polymer, is preferably a linear molecule, however, branched cationic or polycationic peptides, proteins or polymers may also be used. Each cationic or polycationic protein, peptide or polymer of the polymeric carrier, which may be used to complex the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine contains at least one \u2014SH moiety, most preferably at least one cysteine residue or any further chemical group exhibiting an \u2014SH moiety, capable to form a disulfide linkage upon condensation with at least one further cationic or polycationic protein, peptide or polymer as cationic component of the polymeric carrier as mentioned herein. Each cationic or polycationic protein, peptide or polymer or any further component of the polymeric carrier, which may be used to complex the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine is preferably linked to its neighbouring component(s) (cationic proteins, peptides, polymers or other components) via disulfide-crosslinking. Preferably, the disulfide-crosslinking is a (reversible) disulfide bond (\u2014S\u2014S\u2014) between at least one cationic or polycationic protein, peptide or polymer and at least one further cationic or polycationic protein, peptide or polymer or other component of the polymeric carrier. The disulfide-crosslinking is typically formed by condensation of \u2014SH-moieties of the components of the polymeric carrier particularly of the cationic components. Such an \u2014SH-moiety may be part of the structure of the cationic or polycationic protein, peptide or polymer or any further component of the polymeric carrier prior to disulfide-crosslinking or may be added prior to disulfide-crosslinking by a modification as defined below. In this context, the sulphurs adjacent to one component of the polymeric carrier, necessary for providing a disulfide bond, may be provided by the component itself, e.g. by a \u2014SH moiety as defined herein or may be provided by modifying the component accordingly to exhibit a \u2014SH moiety. These \u2014SH-moieties are typically provided by each of the components, e.g. via a cysteine or any further (modified) amino acid of the component, which carries a \u2014SH moiety. In the case that the cationic component or any further component of the polymeric carrier is a peptide or protein it is preferred that the \u2014SH moiety is provided by at least one cysteine residue. Alternatively, the component of the polymeric carrier may be modified accordingly with a \u2014SH moiety, preferably via a chemical reaction with a compound carrying a \u2014SH moiety, such that each of the components of the polymeric carrier carries at least one such \u2014SH moiety. Such a compound carrying a \u2014SH moiety may be e.g. an (additional) cysteine or any further (modified) amino acid or compound of the component of the polymeric carrier, which carries a \u2014SH moiety. Such a compound may also be any non-amino compound or moiety, which contains or allows to introduce a \u2014SH moiety into the component as defined herein. Such non-amino compounds may be attached to the component of the polymeric carrier according to the present invention via chemical reactions or binding of compounds, e.g. by binding of a 3-thio propionic acid or 2-iminothiolane (Traut's carboxylic acids, addition (e.g. maleinimide moieties, , unsatured carbonyls, etc.), chemical moieties which can be utilized in the attachment of further components. In some cases the \u2014SH moiety may be masked by protecting groups during chemical attachment to the component. Such protecting groups are known in the art and may be removed after chemical coupling. In each case, the \u2014SH moiety, e.g. of a cysteine or of any further (modified) amino acid or compound, may be present at the terminal ends or internally at any position of the component of the polymeric carrier. As defined herein, each of the components of the polymeric carrier typically exhibits at least one \u2014SH-moiety, but may also contain two, three, four, five, or even more \u2014SH-moieties. Additionally to binding of cationic components a \u2014SH moiety may be used to attach further components of the polymeric carrier of the inventive vaccine as defined herein, particularly an amino acid component, e.g. antigen epitopes, antigens, antibodies, cell penetrating peptides (e.g. TAT), ligands, etc. As defined above, the polymeric carrier, which may be used to complex the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine may be formed by disulfide-crosslinked cationic (or polycationic) components. According to one first alternative, at least one cationic (or polycationic) component of the polymeric carrier, which may be used to complex the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine may be selected from cationic or polycationic peptides or proteins. Such cationic or polycationic peptides or proteins preferably exhibit a length of about 3 to 100 amino acids, preferably a length of about 3 to 50 amino acids, more preferably a length of about 3 to 25 amino acids, e.g. a length of about 3 to 10, 5 to 15, 10 to 20 or 15 to 25 amino acids.

In the specific case that the cationic component of the polymeric carrier, which may be used to complex the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine comprises a cationic or polycationic peptide or protein, the cationic properties of the cationic or polycationic peptide or protein or of the entire polymeric carrier, if the polymeric carrier is entirely composed of cationic or polycationic peptides or proteins, may be determined upon its content of cationic amino acids. Preferably, the content of cationic amino acids in the cationic or polycationic peptide or protein and/or the polymeric carrier is at least 10%, 20%, or 30%, preferably at least 40%, more preferably at least 50%, 60% or 70%, but also preferably at 96%, in the range of about 10% to 90%, more preferably in the range of about 15% to 75%, even more preferably in the range of about 20% to 50%, e.g. 20, 30, 40 or 50%, or in a range formed by any two of the afore mentioned values, provided, that the content of all amino acids, e.g. cationic, lipophilic, hydrophilic, aromatic and further amino acids, in the cationic or polycationic peptide or protein, or in the entire polymeric carrier, if the polymeric carrier is entirely composed of cationic or polycationic peptides or proteins, is 100%.

Any of amino acids Arg, Lys, His, Orn and Xaa may be positioned at any place of the peptide. In this context cationic peptides or proteins in the range of 7-30 amino acids are particular preferred. Even more preferred peptides of this formula are oligoarginines such preferred embodiment, such cationic or polycationic peptides or proteins of the polymeric carrier having the empirical sum formula (I) as shown above, may, without being restricted thereto, comprise at least one of the following preferred embodiment, cationic or polycationic peptides or proteins of the polymeric carrier, having the empirical sum formula (I) as shown above and which comprise or are additionally modified to comprise at least one \u2014SH moiety, may be preferably selected from, without being restricted thereto, at least one of the following subgroup of formulae. The following formulae (as with empirical formula (I)) do not specify any amino acid order, but are intended to reflect empirical formulae by exclusively specifying the (number of) amino acids as components of the respective peptide. Accordingly, as an example, empirical formula Arg(7-29)Lys1 is intended to mean that peptides falling under this formula contain 7 to 19 Arg residues and 1 Lys residue of whatsoever order. If the peptides contain 7 Arg residues and 1 Lys residue, all variants having 7 Arg residues and 1 Lys residue are encompassed. The Lys residue may therefore be positioned anywhere in the e.g. 8 amino acid long sequence composed of 7 Arg and 1 Lys residues. The preferred embodiment, cationic or polycationic peptides or proteins of the polymeric carrier, having the empirical sum formula (I) as shown above and which comprise or are additionally modified to comprise at least one \u2014SH moiety, may be, without being restricted thereto, selected from the subgroup consisting of generic formulas Arg7 (also termed as R7), Arg9 (also termed R9), Arg12 (also termed as R12). According to a one further particular preferred embodiment, the cationic or polycationic peptide or protein of the polymeric carrier, when defined according to formula {(Arg)l;(Lys)m;(His)n;(Orn)o;(Xaa)x} (formula (I)) as shown above and which comprise or are additionally modified to comprise at least one \u2014SH moiety, may be, without being restricted thereto, selected from subformula (Ia): {(Arg)l;(Lys)m;(His)n;(Orn)o;(Xaa)x} formula (Ia) wherein (Arg)l;(Lys)m;(His)n;(Orn)o; and x are as defined herein, Xaa is any amino acid selected from native (=naturally occurring) or non-native amino acids except of Arg, Lys, His, Orn or Cys and y is any number selected from 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, 61-70, 71-80 Arg (Arginine), Lys (Lysine), His (Histidine) and Orn (Ornithine) represents at least 10% of all amino acids of the oligopeptide. This embodiment may apply to situations, wherein the cationic or polycationic peptide or protein of the polymeric carrier, e.g. when defined according to empirical formula (Arg)l;(Lys)m;(His)n;(Orn)o(Xaa)x (formula (I)) as shown above, comprises or has been modified with at least one cysteine as \u2014SH moiety in the above meaning such that the cationic or polycationic peptide as cationic component carries at least one cysteine, which is capable to form a disulfide bond with other components of the polymeric carrier. According to another particular preferred embodiment, the cationic or polycationic peptide or protein of the polymeric carrier, when defined according to formula {(Arg)l;(Lys)m;(His)n;(Orn)o;(Xaa)x} (formula (I)) as shown above, may be, without being restricted thereto, selected from subformula (Ib): Cys1{(Arg)l;(Lys)m;(His)n;(Orn)o;(Xaa)x}Cys2 (formula (Ib)) wherein empirical formula {(Arg)l;(Lys)m;(His)n;(Orn)o;(Xaa)x} (formula (I)) is as defined herein and forms a core of an amino acid sequence according to (semiempirical) formula (I) and wherein Cys1 and Cys2 are Cysteines proximal to, or terminal to (Arg)l;(Lys)m;(His)n;(Orn)o;(Xaa)x. Exemplary examples may comprise any of the above sequences flanked by two Cys and following sequences: This embodiment may apply to situations, wherein the cationic or polycationic peptide or protein of the polymeric carrier, which may be used to complex the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine, e.g. when defined according to empirical formula (Arg)l;(Lys)m;(His)n;(Orn)o;(Xaa)x (formula (I)) as shown above, has been modified with at least two cysteines as \u2014SH moieties in the above meaning such that the cationic or polycationic peptide of the inventive polymeric carrier carries at least two (terminal) cysteines, which are capable to form a disulfide bond with other components of the polymeric carrier. According to a second alternative, at least one cationic (or polycationic) component of the polymeric carrier may be selected from e.g. any (non-peptidic) cationic or polycationic polymer suitable in this context, provided that this (non-peptidic) cationic or polycationic polymer exhibits or is modified to exhibit at least one \u2014SH-moiety, which provide for a disulfide bond linking the cationic or polycationic polymer with another component of the polymeric carrier as defined herein. Thus, likewise as defined herein, the polymeric carrier may comprise the same or different cationic or polycationic polymers. In the specific case that the cationic component of the polymeric carrier comprises a (non-peptidic) cationic or polycationic polymer the cationic properties of the (non-peptidic) cationic or polycationic polymer may be determined upon its content of cationic charges when compared to the overall charges of the components of the cationic polymer. Preferably, the content of cationic charges in the cationic polymer at a (physiological) pH as defined herein is at least 10%, 20%, or 30%, preferably at least 40%, more preferably at least 50%, 60% or 70%, but also preferably at 96%, in the range of about 10% to 90%, more preferably in the range of about 30% to 100%, even preferably in the range of about 50% to 100%, e.g. 50, 60, 70, 80%, 90% or 100%, or in a range formed by any two of the afore mentioned values, provided, that the content of all charges, e.g. positive and negative charges at a (physiological) pH as defined herein, in the entire cationic polymer is 100%. Preferably, the (non-peptidic) cationic component of the polymeric carrier represents a cationic or polycationic polymer, typically exhibiting a molecular weight of about 0.1 or 0.5 kDa to about 100 kDa, preferably of about 1 kDa to about 75 kDa, more preferably of about 5 kDa to about 50 kDa, even more preferably of about 5 kDa to about 30 kDa, or a molecular weight of about 10 kDa to about 50 kDa, even more preferably of about 10 kDa to about 30 kDa. Additionally, the (non-peptidic) cationic or polycationic polymer typically exhibits at least one \u2014SH-moiety, which is capable to form a disulfide linkage upon condensation with either other cationic components or other components of the polymeric carrier as defined herein. In the above context, the (non-peptidic) cationic component of the polymeric carrier, which may be used to complex the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine may be selected from acrylates, modified acrylates, such of amines forming beta aminoesters or other polymers polyesters, of these (non-peptidic) cationic or polycationic polymers typically exhibits at least one \u2014SH-moiety, wherein these at least one \u2014SH-moiety may be introduced into the (non-peptidic) cationic or polycationic polymer by chemical modifications, e.g. using imonothiolan, 3-thio propionic acid or introduction of \u2014SH-moieties containing amino acids, such as cysteine or any further (modified) amino acid. Such \u2014SH-moieties are preferably as already defined above. In the context of the polymeric carrier, the cationic components, which form basis for the polymeric carrier, which may be used to complex the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine by disulfide-crosslinkage, may be the same or different from each other. It is also particularly preferred that the polymeric carrier of the present invention comprises mixtures of cationic peptides, proteins or polymers and optionally further components as defined herein, which are crosslinked by disulfide bonds as described herein. In this context, the inventive polymeric carrier, which may be used to complex the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine allows to combine desired properties of different (short) cationic or polycationic peptides, proteins or polymers or other components. The polymeric carrier, e.g., allows to efficiently compact nucleic acids for the purpose of efficient transfection of nucleic acids, for adjuvant therapy, for the purposes of gene therapy, for gene knock-down or others strategies without loss of activity, particularly exhibiting an efficient transfection of a nucleic acid into different cell lines in vitro but particularly transfection in vivo. The polymeric carrier is furthermore not toxic to cells, provides for efficient release of its nucleic acid cargo, is stable during lyophilization and is applicable as immunostimulating agent or adjuvant. In this context the components of the inventive polymeric carrier can be varied in such a way that the cytokine pattern induced can be determined. In particular, the polymeric carrier formed by disulfide-linked cationic components allows considerably to vary its peptide or polymeric content and thus to modulate its biophysical/biochemical properties, particularly the cationic properties of the polymeric carrier, quite easily and fast, e.g. by incorporating as cationic components the same or different cationic peptide(s) or polymer(s) and optionally adding other components into the polymeric carrier. Even though consisting of quite small non-toxic monomer units the polymeric carrier forms a long cationic binding sequence providing a strong condensation of the mRNA as its nucleic acid cargo and complex stability. Under the reducing conditions of the cytosole (e.g. cytosolic GSH), the complex is rapidly degraded into its (cationic) components, which are further degraded (e.g. oligopeptides). This supports deliberation of the nucleic acid cargo in the cytosol. Due to degradation into small oligopeptides or polymers in the cytosol, no toxicity is observed as known for high-molecular oligopeptides or polymers, e.g. from high-molecular polyarginine. Accordingly, the polymeric carrier, which may be used to complex the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine may comprise different (short) cationic or polycationic peptides, proteins or polymers selected from cationic or polycationic peptides, proteins or (non-peptidic) polymers as defined above, optionally together with further components as defined herein. Additionally, the polymeric carrier, which may be used to complex the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine as defined above, more preferably at least one of the different (short) cationic or polycationic peptides or (non-peptidic) polymers forming basis for the polymeric carrier via disulfide-crosslinking, may be, preferably prior to the disulfide-crosslinking, modified with at least one further component. Alternatively, the polymeric carrier as such may be modified with at least one further component. It may also optionally comprise at least one further component, which typically forms the polymeric carrier disulfide together with the other the (short) cationic or polycationic peptides as defined above via disulfide crosslinking. To allow modification of a cationic or polycationic peptide or a (non-peptidic) polymer as defined above, each of the components of the polymeric carrier may (preferably already prior to disulfide-crosslinking) also contain at least one further functional moiety, which allows attaching such further components as defined herein. Such functional moieties may be selected from functionalities which allow the attachment of further components, e.g. functionalities as defined herein, e.g. by amide formation (e.g. carboxylic acids, sulphonic acids, addition (e.g. maleinimide moieties, , unsatured carbonyls, etc.), chemical moieties which can be utilized in the attachment of further components. According to a particularly preferred embodiment, the further component, which may be contained in the polymeric carrier, and which may be used to complex the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine or which may be used to modify the different (short) cationic or polycationic peptides or (non-peptidic) polymers forming basis for the polymeric carrier or the biophysical/biochemical properties of the polymeric carrier as defined herein, is an amino acid component (AA). According to the present invention, the amino acid component (AA) comprises a number of amino acids preferably in a range of about 1 to 100, preferably in a range of about 1 to 50, more preferably selected from a number comprising 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 or 15-20, or may be selected from a range formed by any two of the afore mentioned values. In this context the amino acids of amino acid component (AA) can be chosen independently from each other. For example if in the polymeric carrier two or more (AA) components are present they can be the same or can be different from each other. The amino acid component (AA) may contain or may be flanked (e.g. terminally) by a \u2014SH containing moiety, which allows introducing this component (AA) via a disulfide bond into the polymeric carrier as defined herein. In the specific case that the \u2014SH containing moiety represents a cysteine, the amino acid component (AA) may also be read as -Cys-(AA)-Cys- wherein Cys represents Cysteine and provides for the necessary SH-moiety for a disulfide bond. The SH containing moiety may be also introduced into amino acid component (AA) using any of modifications or reactions as shown above for the cationic component or any of its components. Furthermore, the amino acid component (AA) may be provided with two \u2014SH-moieties (or even more), e.g. in a form represented by formula HS-(AA)-SH to allow binding to two functionalities via disulfide bonds, e.g. if the amino acid component (AA) is used as a linker between two further components (e.g. as a linker between two cationic polymers). In this case, one \u2014SH moiety is preferably protected in a first step using a protecting group as known in the art, leading to an amino acid component (AA) of formula HS-(AA)-S-protecting group. Then, the amino acid component (AA) may be bound to a further component of the polymeric carrier, to form a first disulfide bond via the non-protected SH moiety. The protected \u2014SH-moiety is then typically deprotected and bound to a further free SH-moiety of a further component of the polymeric carrier to form a second disulfide bond. Alternatively, the amino acid component (AA) may be provided with other functionalities as already described above for the other components of the polymeric carrier, which allow binding of the amino acid component (AA) to any of components of the polymeric carrier. Thus, according to the present invention, the amino acid component (AA) may be bound to further components of the polymeric carrier, which may be used to complex the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine with or without using a disulfide linkage. Binding without using a disulfide linkage may be accomplished by any of the reactions described above, preferably by binding the amino acid component (AA) to the other component of the polymeric carrier using an amid-chemistry as defined herein. If desired or necessary, the other terminus of the amino acid component (AA), e.g. the N- or C-terminus, may be used to couple another component, e.g. a ligand L. For this purpose, the other terminus of the amino acid component (AA) preferably comprises or is modified to comprise a further functionality, e.g. an alkyn-species (see above), which may be used to add the other component via e.g. click-chemistry. If the ligand is bound via an acid-labile bond, the bond is preferably cleaved off in the endosome and the polymeric carrier presents amino acid component (AA) at its surface. The amino acid component (AA) may occur as a further component of the polymeric carrier, which may be used to complex the at least one mRNA of the inventive vaccine as defined above, e.g. as a linker between cationic components e.g. as a linker between one cationic peptide and a further cationic peptide, as a linker between one cationic polymer and a further cationic polymer, as a linker between one cationic peptide and a cationic polymer, all preferably as defined herein, or as an additional component of the polymeric carrier, e.g. by binding the amino acid component (AA) to the polymeric carrier or a component thereof, e.g. via side chains, SH-moieties or via further moieties as defined herein, wherein the amino acid component (AA) is preferably accordingly modified. According to a further and particularly preferred alternative, the amino acid component (AA), may be used to modify the polymeric carrier, particularly the content of cationic components in the polymeric carrier as defined above. In this context it is preferable, that the content of cationic components in the polymeric carrier is at least 10%, 20%, or 30%, preferably at least 40%, more preferably at least 50%, 60% or 70%, but also preferably at 96%, in the range of about 30% to 100%, more preferably in the range of about 50% to 100%, even preferably in the range of about 70% to 100%, e.g. 70, 80, 90 or 100%, or in a range formed by any two of the afore mentioned values, provided, that the content of all components in the polymeric carrier is 100%. In the context of the present invention, the amino acid component (AA) may be selected from the following alternatives. According to a first alternative, the amino acid component (AA) may be an aromatic amino acid component (AA). The incorporation of aromatic amino acids or sequences as amino aromatic acid component (AA) into the polymeric carrier of the present invention enables a different (second) binding of the polymeric carrier to the nucleic acid due to interactions of the aromatic amino acids with the bases of the nucleic acid cargo in contrast to the binding thereof by cationic charged sequences of the polymeric carrier molecule to the phosphate backbone. This interaction may occur e.g. by intercalations or by minor or major groove binding. This kind of interaction is not prone to decompaction by anionic complexing partners (e.g. Heparin, Hyaluronic acids) which are found mainly in the extracellular matrix in vivo and is also less susceptible to salt effects. For this purpose, the amino acids in the aromatic amino acid component (AA) may be selected from either the same or different aromatic amino acids e.g. selected from Trp, Tyr, or Phe. Alternatively, the amino acids (or the entire aromatic amino acid component (AA)) may be selected from following Such peptide combinations may be repeated e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 or even more times. These peptide combinations may also be combined with each other as suitable. Additionally, the aromatic amino acid component (AA) may contain or may be flanked by a \u2014SH containing moiety, which allows introducing this component via a disulfide bond as a further part of the polymeric carrier as defined above, e.g. as a linker. Such a \u2014SH containing moiety may be any moiety as defined herein suitable to couple one component as defined herein to a further component as defined herein. As an example, such a \u2014SH containing moiety may be a cysteine. Then, e.g. the aromatic amino acid component (AA) may be selected from e.g. may also be replaced by any modified peptide or chemical compound carrying a free \u2014SH-moiety as defined herein. (SEQ ID NOs: 43-75). Such peptide combinations may be repeated e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 or even more times. These peptide combinations may also be combined with each other as suitable. Additionally, the aromatic amino acid component (AA) may contain or represent at least one proline, which may serve as a structure breaker of longer sequences of Trp, Tyr and Phe in the aromatic amino acid component (AA), preferably two, three or more prolines. According to a second alternative, the amino acid component (AA) may be a hydrophilic (and preferably non charged polar) amino acid component (AA). The incorporation of hydrophilic (and preferably non charged polar) amino acids or sequences as amino hydrophilic (and preferably non charged polar) acid component (AA) into the polymeric carrier of the present invention enables a more flexible binding to the nucleic acid cargo. This leads to a more effective compaction of the nucleic acid cargo and hence to a better protection against nucleases and unwanted decompaction. It also allows provision of a (long) polymeric carrier which exhibits a reduced cationic charge over the entire carrier and in this context to better adjusted binding properties, if desired or necessary. For this purpose, the amino acids in the hydrophilic (and preferably non charged polar) amino acid component (AA) may be selected from either the same or different hydrophilic (and preferably non charged polar) amino acids e.g. selected from Thr, Ser, Asn or Gln. Alternatively, the amino acids (or the entire hydrophilic (and preferably non charged polar) amino acid component (AA)) may be selected from following Such peptide combinations may be repeated e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 or even more times. These peptide combinations may also be combined with each other as suitable. Additionally, the hydrophilic (and preferably non-charged polar) amino acid component (AA) may contain or may be flanked by a \u2014SH containing moiety, which allows introducing this component via a disulfide bond as a further part of the polymeric carrier as defined above, e.g. as a linker. Such a \u2014SH containing moiety may be any moiety as defined herein suitable to couple one component as defined herein to a further component as defined herein. As an example, such a \u2014SH containing moiety may be a cysteine. Then, e.g. the hydrophilic (and preferably non-charged polar) amino acid component (AA) may be selected from above may also be replaced by any modified peptide or chemical compound carrying a free \u2014SH-moiety as defined herein. (SEQ ID NOs: 112-153) Such peptide combinations may be repeated e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15 or even more times. These peptide combinations may also be combined with each other as suitable. Additionally, the hydrophilic (and preferably non-charged polar) amino acid component (AA) may contain at least one proline, which may serve as a structure breaker of longer sequences of Ser, Thr and Asn in the hydrophilic (and preferably non charged polar) amino acid component (AA), preferably two, three or more prolines. According to a third alternative, the amino acid component (AA) may be a lipophilic amino acid component (AA). The incorporation of lipophilic amino acids or sequences as amino lipophilic acid component (AA) into the polymeric carrier of the present invention enables a stronger compaction of the nucleic acid cargo and/or the polymeric carrier and its nucleic acid cargo when forming a complex. This is particularly due to interactions of one or more polymer strands of the polymeric carrier, particularly of lipophilic sections of lipophilic amino acid component (AA) and the nucleic acid cargo. This interaction will preferably add an additional stability to the complex between the polymeric carrier and its nucleic acid cargo. This stabilization may somehow be compared to a sort of non covalent crosslinking between different polymer strands. Especially in aqueous environment this interaction is typically strong and provides a significant effect. For this purpose, the amino acids in the lipophilic amino acid component (AA) may be selected from either the same or different lipophilic amino acids e.g. selected from Leu, Val, Ile, Ala, Met. Alternatively, the amino acid AA (or the entire lipophilic amino acid component (AA)) may be selected from Such peptide combinations may be repeated e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15 or even more times. These peptide combinations may also be combined with each other as suitable. Additionally, the lipophilic amino acid component (AA) may contain or may be flanked by a \u2014SH containing moiety, which allows introducing this component via a disulfide bond as a further part of the polymeric carrier above, e.g. as a linker. Such a \u2014SH containing moiety may be any moiety as defined herein suitable to couple one component as defined herein to a further component as defined herein. As an example, such a \u2014SH containing moiety may be a cysteine. Then, e.g. the lipophilic amino acid component (AA) may be selected from above may also be replaced by any modified peptide or chemical compound carrying a free \u2014SH-moiety as defined herein. (SEQ ID NOs: 189-229) Such peptide combinations may be repeated e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15 or even more times. These peptide combinations may also be combined with each other as suitable. Additionally, the lipophilic amino acid component (AA) may contain at least one proline, which may serve as a structure breaker of longer sequences of Leu, Val, Ile, Ala and Met in the lipophilic amino acid component (AA), preferably two, three or more prolines. Finally, according to a fourth alternative, the amino acid component (AA) may be a weak basic amino acid component (AA). The incorporation of weak basic amino acids or sequences as weak basic amino acid component (AA) into the polymeric carrier of the present invention may serve as a proton sponge and facilitates endosomal escape (also called endosomal release) (proton sponge effect). Incorporation of such a weak basic amino acid component (AA) preferably enhances transfection efficiency. For this purpose, the amino acids in the weak basic amino acid component (AA) may be selected from either the same or different weak amino acids e.g. selected from histidine or aspartate (aspartic acid). Alternatively, the weak basic amino acids (or the entire weak basic amino acid component (AA)) may be selected from following Such peptide combinations may be repeated e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15 or even more times. These peptide combinations may also be combined with each other as suitable. Additionally, the weak basic amino acid component (AA) may contain or may be flanked by a \u2014SH containing moiety, which allows introducing this component via a disulfide bond as a further part of the polymeric carrier as defined above, e.g. as a linker. Such a \u2014SH containing moiety may be any moiety as defined herein suitable to couple one component as defined herein to a further component as defined herein. As an example, such a \u2014SH containing moiety may be a cysteine. Then, e.g. the weak basic amino acid component (AA) may be selected from e.g. above may also be replaced by any modified peptide or chemical compound carrying a free \u2014SH-moiety as defined herein. (SEQ ID NOs: 242-255) Such peptide combinations may be repeated e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15 or even more times. These peptide combinations may also be combined with each other as suitable. Additionally, the weak basic amino acid component (AA) may contain at least one proline, which may serve as a structure breaker of longer sequences of histidine or aspartate (aspartic acid) in the weak basic amino acid component (AA), preferably two, three or more prolines. According to a fifth alternative, the amino acid component (AA) may be a signal peptide or signal sequence, a localisation signal or sequence, a nuclear localisation signal or sequence (NLS), an antibody, a cell penetrating peptide, (e.g. TAT), etc. Preferably such an amino acid component (AA) is bound to the polymeric carrier or to another component of the polymeric carrier via a (reversible) disulfide bond. In this context the signal peptide or signal sequence, a localisation signal or sequence, a nuclear localisation signal or sequence (NLS), an antibody, a cell penetrating peptide, (e.g. TAT), etc.; additionally comprises at least one \u2014SH-moiety.

More preferably, the immunostimulatory RNA may be a (linear) single-stranded RNA. Even more preferably, the immunostimulatory RNA may be a (long) (linear) (single-stranded) non-coding RNA. In this context it is particular preferred that the is RNA carries a triphosphate at its 5-end which is the case for in vitro transcribed RNA. An immunostimulatory RNA may also occur as a short RNA oligonucleotide as defined herein. An immunostimulatory RNA as used herein may furthermore be selected from any class of RNA molecules, found in nature or being prepared synthetically, and which can induce an innate immune response and may support an adaptive immune response induced by an antigen. In this context, an immune response may occur in various ways. A substantial factor for a suitable (adaptive) immune response is the stimulation of different T cell sub-populations. T-lymphocytes are typically divided into two sub-populations, the T-helper 1 (Th1) cells and the T-helper 2 (Th2) cells, with which the immune system is capable of destroying intracellular (Th1) and extracellular (Th2) pathogens (e.g. antigens). The two Th cell populations differ in the pattern of the effector proteins (cytokines) produced by them. Thus, Th1 cells assist the cellular immune response by activation of macrophages and cytotoxic T cells. Th2 cells, on the other hand, promote the humoral immune response by stimulation of B cells for conversion into plasma cells and by formation of antibodies (e.g. against antigens). The Th1/Th2 ratio is therefore of great importance in the induction and maintenance of an adaptive immune response. In connection with the present invention, the Th1/Th2 ratio of the (adaptive) immune response is preferably shifted in the direction towards the cellular response (Th1 response) and a cellular immune response is thereby induced. According to one example, the innate immune system which may support an adaptive immune response may be activated by ligands of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLRs are a family of highly conserved pattern recognition receptor (PRR) polypeptides that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and play a critical role in innate immunity in mammals. Currently at least thirteen family members, a number of specific TLR ligands have been identified. It was e.g. found that unmethylated bacterial DNA and synthetic analogs thereof (CpG DNA) are ligands for TLR9 (Hemmi H et al. (2000) Nature 408:740-5; Bauer S et al. (2001) Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98, 9237-42). Furthermore, it has been reported that ligands for certain TLRs include certain nucleic acid molecules and that certain types of RNA are immunostimulatory in a sequence-independent or sequence-dependent manner, wherein these various immunostimulatory RNAs may e.g. stimulate TLR3, TLR7, or TLR8, or such as RIG-I, etc. Preferably, an immunostimulatory nucleic acid, preferably an immunostimulatory RNA (is RNA), as used herein, may comprise any RNA sequence known to be immunostimulatory, including, without being limited thereto, RNA sequences representing and/or encoding ligands of TLRs, preferably selected from human family members TLR1-TLR10 or murine family members TLR1-TLR13, more preferably selected from (human) family members TLR1-TLR10, even more preferably from TLR7 and TLR8, ligands for intracellular receptors for RNA (such as RIG-I or MDA-5, etc.) (see e.g. Meylan, E., Tschopp, J. (2006). Toll-like receptors and RNA helicases: two parallel ways to trigger antiviral responses. Mol. Cell. 22, 561-569), or any other immunostimulatory RNA sequence. Furthermore, (classes of) immunostimulatory RNA molecules, used as a further compound of the inventive vaccine, may include any other RNA capable of eliciting an immune response. Without being limited thereto, such an immunostimulatory RNA may include ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), messenger RNA (mRNA), and viral RNA (vRNA).

Finally, the so called \"(adjuvant) component\", which may be used to together with the mRNA in the inventive vaccine, is preferably prepared according to a first step by complexing the at least one (m)RNA of the (adjuvant) component with a cationic or polycationic compound and/or with a polymeric carrier, preferably as defined herein, in a specific ratio to form a stable complex. In this context, it is highly preferable, that no free cationic or polycationic compound or polymeric carrier or only a neclectably small amount thereof remains in the (adjuvant) component after complexing the (m)RNA. Accordingly, the ratio of the (m)RNA and the cationic or polycationic compound and/or the polymeric carrier in the (adjuvant) component is typically selected in a range that the (m)RNA is entirely complexed and no free cationic or polycationic compound or polymeric carrier or only a neclectably small amount thereof remains in the composition.

Such ratios, particularly weight and/or N/P ratios may also be applied to ratios of the at least one mRNA encoding at least one antigen as defined herein to a cationic or polycationic polymer or a polymeric carrier as defined herein used to complex the at least one mRNA. According to a further preferred aspect, the mRNA of the inventive vaccine encoding at least one antigen as defined above may be formulated together with an (adjuvant) component as defined above, wherein the inventive vaccine may comprise a) an (adjuvant) component, comprising or consisting of at least one (m)RNA, complexed with a cationic or polycationic compound and/or with a polymeric carrier, preferably as defined herein, and b) at least one free mRNA, encoding an antigen, preferably as defined herein.

In the context of the present invention, an N/P-ratio is preferably in the range of about 0.01-4, 0.01-2, 0.1-2 or 0.1-1.5 regarding the ratio of nucleic acids:cationic or polycationic peptide contained in the inventive vaccine, and most preferably in the range of about 0.1-1. Such an N/P ratio is preferably designed to provide good transfection properties in vivo and transport into and through cell membranes. Preferably, for this purpose, cationic or polycationic compound and/or polymeric carriers as used herein, are based on peptide sequences. In a further preferred aspect of the present invention the inventive vaccine may comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or vehicle. In the context of the present invention, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier typically includes the liquid or non-liquid basis of a composition comprising the components of the inventive vaccine. If the composition is provided in liquid form, the carrier will typically be pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline or buffered (aqueous) solutions, e.g. phosphate, buffered solutions. The injection buffer may be hypertonic, isotonic or hypotonic with reference to the specific reference medium, i.e. the buffer may have a higher, identical or lower salt content with reference to the specific reference medium, wherein preferably such concentrations of the afore mentioned salts may be used, which do not lead to damage of cells due to osmosis or other concentration effects. Reference media are e.g. liquids occurring in \"in vivo\" methods, such as blood, lymph, cytosolic liquids, or other body liquids, or e.g. liquids, which may be used as reference media in \"in vitro\" methods, such as common buffers or liquids. Such common buffers or liquids are known to a skilled person. Ringer-Lactate solution is particularly preferred as a liquid basis. However, one or more compatible solid or liquid fillers or diluents or encapsulating compounds, which are suitable for administration to a patient to be treated, may be used as well for the inventive vaccine. The term \"compatible\" as used here means that these constituents of the inventive vaccine are capable of being mixed with the components of the inventive vaccine in such a manner that no interaction occurs which would substantially reduce the pharmaceutical effectiveness of the inventive vaccine under typical use conditions. According to a specific aspect, the inventive vaccine may comprise an adjuvant. In this context, an adjuvant may be understood as any compound, which is suitable to initiate or increase an immune response of the innate immune system, i.e. a non-specific immune response. With other words, when administered, the vaccine preferably elicits an innate immune response due to the adjuvant, optionally contained therein. Preferably, such an adjuvant may be selected from an adjuvant known to a skilled person and suitable for the present case, i.e. supporting the induction of an innate immune response in a mammal, e.g. an adjuvant protein as defined above or an adjuvant as defined in the following. According to one aspect such an adjuvant may be selected from an (adjuvant) component as defined above. According to one further aspect such an adjuvant may be selected from any adjuvant known to a skilled person and suitable for the present case, i.e. supporting the induction of an innate immune response in a mammal and/or suitable for depot and delivery of the components of the inventive vaccine.

Such an immunostimulatory agent allows providing passive vaccination additional to active vaccination triggered by the mRNA encoded antigen of the inventive composition or vaccine composition. The inventive vaccine can additionally contain one or more auxiliary substances in order to increase its immunogenicity or immunostimulatory capacity, if desired. A synergistic action of the inventive vaccine and of an auxiliary substance, which may be optionally contained in the vaccine or may be formulated with the inhibitor, is preferably achieved thereby. Depending on the various types of auxiliary substances, various mechanisms can come into consideration in this respect. For example, compounds that permit the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs), for example lipopolysaccharides, TNF-alpha or CD40 ligand, form a first class of suitable auxiliary substances. In general, it is possible to use as auxiliary substance any agent that influences the immune system in the manner of a \"danger signal\" (LPS, GP96, etc.) or cytokines, such as GM-CFS, which allow an immune response to be enhanced and/or influenced in a targeted manner. Particularly preferred auxiliary substances are cytokines, such as monokines, lymphokines, interleukins or chemokines, that further promote the innate such as hGH. The inventive vaccine can also additionally contain any further compound, which is known to be immunostimulating due to its binding affinity (as ligands) receptor, or a ligand of a RIG-I like receptor. In this context the inventive vaccine may also additionally contain an immunostimulatory nucleic acid, preferably an immunostimulatory RNA (is RNA), as defined above.

In particular aspects, the inventive vaccine may be administered to a newborn or an infant in the fall or winter, i.e., prior to or during the influenza season in each hemisphere. In one aspect, a newborn or an infant is administered his/her first dose early in the season, e.g., late September or early October, so that the second dose (if necessary) can be given prior to the peak of the influenza season. In particular aspects, the inventive vaccine may be administered at least once, preferably twice or more to a newborn or an infant prior to a treatment of a disease as defined herein, preferably at least 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 10 days, 15 days, 30 days, 45 days, 2 months, 75 days, e.g. 1 to 5 days, 1 to 10 days, 5 to 15 days, 10 to 20 days, 15 to 25 days, 20 to 30 days, 25 to 35 days, 30 to 50 days, 40 to 60 days, 50 to 70 days, 1 to 75 days, or 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, or at least 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 months prior to a treatment of a disease as defined herein. A second or further dose may then be administered directly prior to treatment, concurrent with or subsequent to treatment. Furthermore, a disease as defined according to the first embodiment of the present invention is any disease selected from infectious diseases, preferably (viral, bacterial or protozoological) infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, allergies or allergic diseases or cancer or tumour diseases. Such diseases include cancer or tumour diseases, preferably selected from melanomas, cancer, pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, mammary carcinomas (=breast cancer), cancer, urethral cancer, CUP syndrome, head/neck tumours, colon carcinoma, oesophageal carcinoma (=Oesophageal cancer), wart involvement, tumours of the small intestine, craniopharyngeomas, ovarian carcinoma, genital tumours, ovarian cancer (=ovarian carcinoma), pancreatic carcinoma (=pancreatic cancer), endometrial carcinoma, liver metastases, penile cancer, tongue cancer, gall bladder cancer, leukaemia, plasmocytoma, lid tumour, prostate cancer (=prostate tumours), etc. According to one further specific aspect, diseases as defined herein comprise infectious diseases, preferably (viral, bacterial or protozoological) infectious diseases. Such infectious diseases, preferably viral, bacterial or protozoological infectious diseases, are typically selected from viral infectious diseases such as influenza, preferably influenza-A, influenza-B, influenza-C or thogotovirus, or any further combination malaria, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), respiratory syncytial virus infection, yellow fever, AIDS, Lyme borreliosis, Leishmaniasis, anthrax, meningitis, Condyloma acuminata, hollow warts, Dengue fever, Ebola cold, early summer meningoencephalitis (FSME), shingles, hepatitis, herpes simplex infectiosa (Pfeiffer's glandular smallpox, polio (childhood lameness), pseudo-croup, Erythema infectiosum (fifth disease), rabies, warts, West Nile fever, chickenpox, cytomegalic virus (CMV), bacterial infectious diseases such as inflammation), anthrax, appendicitis, borreliosis, botulism, Camphylobacter, fever, gas syndrome, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Salmonella paratyphus, Salmonella typhus, scarlet fever, syphilis, tetanus, tripper, tsutsugamushi disease, tuberculosis, typhus, vaginitis (colpitis), soft chancre, and infectious diseases caused by parasites, protozoa or fungi, such as amoebiasis, bilharziosis, Chagas miniature tapeworm. According to another specific aspect, diseases as defined herein comprise autoimmune diseases as defined in the following. Autoimmune diseases can be broadly divided into systemic and organ-specific or localised autoimmune disorders, depending on the principal clinico-pathologic features of each disease. Autoimmune diseases may be divided into the categories of systemic syndromes, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, Scleroderma, Rheumatoid and polymyositis or local syndromes which may be endocrinologic (type I diabetes (Diabetes mellitus (multiple sclerosis) or can involve virtually any circumscribed mass of body tissue. The autoimmune diseases to be treated may be selected from the group consisting of type I autoimmune diseases or type II autoimmune diseases or type III autoimmune diseases or type IV autoimmune diseases, such as, for example, multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, type I diabetes (Diabetes mellitus Type 1), chronic polyarthritis, Basedow's disease, autoimmune forms of chronic hepatitis, colitis ulcerosa, type I allergy diseases, type II allergy diseases, type III allergy diseases, type IV allergy diseases, fibromyalgia, hair loss, Bechterew's disease, Crohn's disease, Myasthenia gravis, arthritis, psoriasis, vasculitis, etc, or type II diabetes. While the exact mode as to why the immune system induces an immune reaction against autoantigens has not been elucidated so far, there are several findings with regard to the etiology. Accordingly, the autoreaction may be due to a T cell bypass. A normal immune system requires the activation of B cells by T cells before the former can produce antibodies in large quantities. This requirement of a T cell can be by-passed in rare instances, such as infection by organisms producing super-antigens, which are capable of initiating polyclonal activation of B cells, or even of T cells, by directly binding to the -subunit of T cell receptors in a non-specific fashion. Another explanation deduces autoimmune diseases from a \"Molecular Mimicry\": an exogenous antigen may share structural similarities with certain host antigens; thus, any antibody produced against this antigen (which mimics the self-antigens) can also, in theory, bind to the host antigens and amplify the immune response. Autoimmune diseases based on molecular mimicry are known to a skilled person for various viral and bacterial antigens. The most striking form of molecular mimicry is observed in Group A beta-haemolytic streptococci, which shares antigens with human myocardium, and is responsible for the cardiac manifestations of rheumatic fever. Additionally, according to one further specific aspect, diseases as defined herein comprise allergies or allergic diseases, i.e. diseases related to allergies. Allergy is a condition that typically involves an abnormal, acquired immunological hypersensitivity to certain foreign antigens or allergens, such as the allergy antigens as defined herein. Such allergy antigens or allergens may be selected from allergy antigens as defined herein antigens derived from different sources, e.g. from animals, plants, fungi, bacteria, etc. Allergens in this context include e.g. danders, grasses, pollens, molds, drugs, or numerous environmental triggers, etc. Allergies normally result in a local or systemic inflammatory response to these antigens or allergens and lead to immunity in the body against these allergens. Without being bound to theory, several different disease mechanisms are supposed to be involved in the development of allergies. According to a classification scheme by P. Gell and R. Coombs the word \"allergy\" was restricted to type I hypersensitivities, which are caused by the classical IgE mechanism. Type I hypersensitivity is characterised by excessive activation of mast cells and basophils by IgE, resulting in a systemic inflammatory response that can result in symptoms as benign as a runny nose, to life-threatening anaphylactic shock and death. Well known types of allergies include, without being limited thereto, asthma, allergic asthma (leading to swelling of the nasal mucosa), allergic conjunctivitis (leading to redness and to insect stings, skin allergies (leading to and including various rashes, such as eczema, hives (urticaria) and (contact) dermatitis), food allergies, allergies to medicine, etc. Treatment of such allergic disorders or diseases may occur preferably by desensitizing the immune reaction which triggers a specific immune response. Such a desensitizing may be carried out by administering an effective amount of the allergen or allergic antigen encoded by the nucleic acid as defined herein, preferably, when formulated as a pharmaceutical composition, to induce a slight immune reaction. The amount of the allergen or allergic antigen may then be raised step by step in subsequent administrations until the immune system of the patient to be treated tolerates a specific amount of allergen or allergic antigen. Diseases in the context of the present invention may also include type II hypersensitivity reactions (cytotoxic, antibody-dependent), including etc.; III hypersensitivity reactions (immune complex disease), including e.g. serum sickness, Arthus reaction, Systemic lupus erythematosus (delayed-type hypersensitivity immune memory response, antibody-independent), including e.g. contact dermatitis, Mantoux test, chronic transplant rejection, multiple sclerosis, etc.; and type V hypersensitivity reactions (receptor mediated autoimmune disease), including e.g. Graves' disease, Myasthenia Gravis, etc.; In a further preferred embodiment, the inventive vaccine may be formulated as a kit, preferably as a kit of part. Accordingly, the present invention also provides kits, particularly kits of parts, comprising the components of the inventive vaccine either alone or in combination with further ingredients as defined above, and optionally technical instructions with information on the administration and dosage of the inventive vaccine. The components of the inventive vaccine either alone or in combination with further ingredients as defined above may be contained in the kit in either one part of the kit or in different parts of the kit, e.g. each at least one mRNA encoding at least one antigen as defined above in one part of the kit, and preferably further components admixed to the each at least one mRNA encoding at least one antigen or separately in a further part of the kit. Such kits, preferably kits of parts, may be applied, e.g., for any of the above mentioned applications or uses.
