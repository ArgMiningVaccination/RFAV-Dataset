Why We Need to Detox Have you ever experienced symptoms of fatigue, achiness, brain fog, and digestive issues? If your answer is yes, it might be time for you to detox! Without realising, your body slowly begins to build up toxins over time and leaves your body's natural detoxification system in overdrive. What Are Toxins? Toxins are harmful chemicals that get into our bodies, whether that's through external factors such as pollutants and synthetic chemicals, or through the foods we eat via processed foods, preservatives, artificial colours and flavours. These toxins can negatively affect your health and cause many of the symptoms mentioned above. So how do you know when your body is working overtime? Toxin build-up can be caused by: - Drinking too much alcohol Drinking alcohol in excess will place pressure on your liver reducing its ability to carry out its normal functions. Exposing your body to pollutants, such as alcohol, can produce free radicals which may cause damage to a range of cells and your overall health. - Inadequate sleep Sleep allows your brain to rest, recharge, and eliminate toxins that accumulate throughout the day. A lack of sleep can hinder your body's ability to carry out these functions. It is advised that healthy adults need between 7 and 9 hours of sleep per night. - Dehydration Being in a state of dehydration is never good for your body but it can be especially damaging to your detoxification system. Water allows your body's detoxification system to remove waste products from your blood - without sufficient water, the detox process will fail to even begin. - Excessive junk food consumption Consuming too much junk food has been linked to several chronic diseases causing harm to the liver and kidneys. This can reduce your liver and kidney's ability to carry out its normal functions and support your body's detoxification system. What Are The Benefits of Detox? The benefits of detoxing the body are in excess - the ability to cleanse your body of unwanted toxins is an excellent way to achieve a new lease of life.
