Try spiritual healing, which is using our five senses to heal trauma, pain, or emotional disturbance Hello, sun-being! I'm here today to talk to you about a very special thing our body is capable of. Think about a moment in the past when you felt really, truly alive and happy. Now tell me, what did your body feel at that moment? Did you feel your body aching, or for once, did you just feel it relax? The mind and body are connected in almost mystical ways. For centuries, Ayurvedic practices have spoken of how deeply entrenched this connection is and used it to heal both the body and mind. When the mind is still and at peace, the body moves to a state of rest too. Recommended for you: Want to know more about the [mind body connection]? Click here. Through my years of Ayurvedic study, I've seen the mind and the body move from a state of disconnect to a state of harmony. And as the body and mind unite, the spiritual energy of the world begins to flow through us, and we begin to truly live our dharma. The body often reflects the state of mind. In spiritual healing, we flip the script and use the body to slowly achieve harmony with the mind. Thoughts begin to translate into action without you even being conscious of it.

Often, [spiritual coaches take up the work of guiding people](https://iamsahararose.com/blog/ten-things-spiritual-life-coaches-can-do-for-you-sahara-rose/) to heal themselves and set out to achieve what they've dreamt of. What is the spiritual approach to healing? [The spiritual approach to healing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3396089/) focuses on the power of the body, the heart, and the mind. Using the five senses of sight, smell, touch, hearing, and taste, spiritual healing addresses trauma, pain, or any kind of emotional disturbance. As spiritual healing progresses, the mind and body unite and become a conduit for the spiritual energy of the universe at large.

The link between spirituality and pain healing Pain isn't always linked to a physical source. Sometimes, mental agony can take its toll on your physical body. I'm sure you might have heard of people who found that they had more gray hairs growing out when they went through extreme stress or people who go through traumatic events and then look like they've aged ten years over a few days. This is why it becomes crucial to acknowledge pain when it comes to spiritual healing. Constant shoulder pain or aching legs aren't normal. Sometimes, it may be a sign that your mind has something it needs to heal from. When we begin to work on spiritual healing, not only are we healing pain, we become more aware of our soul's gifts, and we begin to move towards our dharma. As the mind and the body begin to align, we'll see the unique destiny that was crafted for us by the world. And as a truly divine being, the world will truly help you achieve anything you dream of. The pain will likely go away. Even if it doesn't, the level of satisfaction that you'll feel because of living your purpose will be your only focus, and the pain will fade into the background.

Are there any practices that help with this? Well, there are as many spiritual healing practices as there are people! Each individual is unique, and it may even take a blend of spiritual practices for you to heal yourself. There's no harm in exploring and trying. Here are a few that I swear by! 1. Meditation [Meditation](https://news.mit.edu/2011/meditation-0505) is a practice in which an individual uses a technique\u2014such as mindfulness, or focusing the mind on a particular object, thought, or activity\u2014to train attention and awareness and to achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm-and-stable state. Even something as simple as rhythmic inhalation and exhalation counts as meditation! It doesn't always mean sitting in silence either; some people love dancing in silence as a form of meditation. Recommended for you: [A guide to Chakra Meditation] 2. Yoga Derived from the Sanskrit word \"Yuji,\" meaning union or yoke, [yoga](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/9-benefits-of-yoga) is a practice that brings together the body and mind. A skilled yoga instructor doesn't just work on making your body flexible, they also help you use the practice to heal past trauma and achieve balance when it comes to your mental and emotional stability. 3. Mantras Mantras are vibrations or sounds that create the desired effect, such as self-awareness, transformation, purification, or healing. Chanting mantras also helps with energizing the body! I love combining yoga with mantras, it immediately relaxes me and helps my mind and my body work together towards my goals. 4. Affirmations Affirmations are positive statements that aim to challenge previously held negative thinking patterns. By writing down or saying affirmations out loud every day, you'll become more aware of your thoughts and feelings. It also really helps boost your confidence. I love saying these affirmations out loud. - Today, I am brimming with energy and overflowing with joy. - My body is healthy; Mind is brilliant; My soul is tranquil. - I have been given endless talents, which I begin to utilize today. - I am guided in my every step by the Spirit who leads me towards what I must know and do. - Happiness is a choice. I base my happiness on my accomplishments and the blessings I've been given. - Creative energy surges through me and leads me to new and brilliant ideas. - My ability to conquer my challenges is limitless; my potential to succeed is infinite. - Everything that is happening now is happening for my ultimate good. - I radiate beauty, charm, and grace. - I am at peace with all that has happened, is happening, and will happen. - My nature is divine; I am a spiritual being. - My life is just beginning. I usually start my day with affirmations and go to bed after saying them as well. They help me set the tone for the day in the morning and settle down at night. 5. Travel Take some time off and travel to new destinations. I've always relied on vacations to help me relax my mind and body when things get too overwhelming. [Here](https://iamsahararose.com/blog/7-dreamy-destinations-thatll-relax-mind-body/) are a few of my favorite destinations.

Singer This powerful book dives into disconnecting from your ego and connecting to the world at large. It's a must-read to help you move away from your doubts and fears! 2.
