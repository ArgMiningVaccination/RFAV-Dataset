Each student mus t accept responsibility for compliance with these regulations and for the consequences associated with noncompliance. The mere literal fulfillment of coursewor k requirements does not automatically guarantee advancement to c andidate status in a particular graduate program . The University reserve s the right to modify policies at any time to conform to professional changes in practice. Organization and Governance The Associate Vice President for Graduate Education coordinates university -wide graduate activities, including candidacy and graduation. Finally, a Graduate Academic Affairs Committee (GAAC) is concerned with the development, improvement, and quality contr ol of graduate education at Saint Louis University. Dean s and Director s are responsible for the graduate programs that f all under their particular School/College /Center . In most units , an Associate Dean for Graduate Education is charged with overseeing th e day-to-day operations of the ir respective graduate programs. Major Fields, Areas of Concentration, Degrees Certificates A complete listing of degree and certificate programs can be found here. Admission P olicies and Procedures Categories of Graduate Students Classified students have been admitted and m atriculated through their particular School/College /Center to pursue advanced degrees and are advised by academic departments or their equivalents. Unclass ified students are not formally pursuing degrees or certificates. Such students may be completing prerequisites for subsequent degree pursuit or simply taking coursework for enrichment. The former group may be eligible for some categories of financial ass istance available through the University, but the latter is not. Ordinarily, a student may not remain in Unclassified status and be eligible for financial aid for more than two academic terms. Probationary students are applicants for Classified admission who are temporarily assigned to this status because of deficits in their academic backgrounds. Tenure in Probationary status may not exceed twelve credit hours or one calendar year. Once the student has advanced to Classified status, s/he may petition that coursework completed while in Probationary status, exclusive of eliminating any prerequisite deficiencies, may be accepted toward partial fulfillment of degree requirements. Conditional Classified students are informally admitted, which permits them to in itiate coursework prior to full approval of Classified status. A student is termed Conditional often because a required document which would complete the Classified application is missing, such as an updated transcript showing the conferral of a degree. Or dinarily, a student may remain in Conditional status for only one academic term, but the coursework completed during that term may subsequently apply toward a graduate degree. Certificate students have been admitted and matriculated to pursue advanced degr ees and are concurrently seeking certificates or have been admitted and matriculated directly into certificate programs without seeking a degree . The student and the major field must understand that, although some completed, advanced, academic work will pa rtially fulfill requirements for both certificate and degree, and some elective credits within the degree program may be assigned to the certificate, full completion of both sets of requirements may total credit hours in an amount greater than that require d to earn the degree alone. Auditors are students admitted into Unclassifi ed status in a Graduate Program and who enroll in coursework but not for academic credit at the Frost or Health Sciences Campuses . They are formally registered with the Registrar's Office in order to be recognized on their transcripts. They are expected to attend classes regularly, but are not responsible for Revised 11/16/11 11 assignments or examinations. Tuition to audit a course is $50 per credit hour. Email, library, and other privileges associated with classified student status are granted to auditors. It is the decision of the Schools/Colleges /Centers whether it is appropriate to permit their classified students to audit classes. In any case, students are permitted to audit a maximum of one course per semester, with a two -course audit limit within a degree program. Visitors are students temporarily admitted for the Summer Sessions at the Frost or Health Sciences Campuses . They must secure department or program permission for entry into desired cour ses. Visitors are not required to formally apply , but they must be admitted b y the Dean or Director of their particular School/College /Center, then register, and a permanent record is created for them. SLU 's graduate alumni are permitted to audit courses w ithin five years of their graduation date. Visitors who audit classes are assessed tuition at $50 per credit hour. Faculty of Saint Louis University may be admitted and register as Unclassified graduate school students. Faculty holding the rank of Assistan t Professor or higher, except librarians with equivalent rank, ordinarily will not be granted Classified status toward pursuit of advanced degrees . Requests for exception to this regulation must be initiated with the Associate Dean for Graduate Education of the particular School/College /Center or other designee . Admission Policies A viable applicant must possess, minimally, a baccalaureate degree or the equivalent from an accredited, recognized college or university at the time of matric ulation as a gradua te student . The prerequisite expected by the major graduate field is the equivalent of an undergraduate area of concentration as understood at Saint Louis University: a sequence of eighteen or more semester -hours of upper -division (advanced undergraduate) courses. In graduate major fields where no corresponding undergraduate major exists, the prerequisite requirement may be expressed in an alternative manner. Three -Year Degrees Decisions regarding acceptance into a graduate degree program will not be made o n the basis of the length of the degree program the student has completed, but rather on the applicant's preparation to pursue graduate work in the discipline. International Applicants Ordinarily, international applicants may not be admitted to Unclassif ied status. Documents are required o f them that present evidence of visa eligibility and certification of financial support for the full period of graduate study. The Office of International Services provides assistance for international applicants (cf. ab ove). International applicants must submit a TOEFL or IELTS score when applying. Exemptions are: English is the official language of the applicant's country; the student attended a US university for four semesters; other cases that warrant exemption determined by the admitting department. Saint Louis University recommends a minimum paper -based TOEFL (PBT) score of 550, an 80 on the computer -based TOEFL (iBT), a 6.5 on the IELTS, and a 4+ on SLU's own SLUWE (Saint Louis University Writing Evaluation). The latter test is administered by ESL once the international student has arrived on campus. Individual graduate programs may decide to set higher minimums based on the level of English proficiency needed for their respective course of studies. This policy emphasizes that the scores listed above indicate a level of English that does not necessarily guarantee th at the international applicant will have a command of spoken and written Engl ish, an ability to read the language and to take notes in it such that s/he will be on equal terms with native speakers of English. It is thus very important that the international student follow the recommendations by ESL for improving her/his English bas ed on the TOEFL/IELTS test score, the SLUWE score and the English proficiency needed by the particular graduate program. It is the student's responsi bility to do so. These recommendations may range from exemption from any ESL courses, to concurrent enrollm ent in ESL and the graduate program, or full -time enrollment in ESL with no registration in graduate -level work until the desired level of English has been achieved. For questions about international applications contact: http://www.slu.edu/x32288.xml Re-application An accepted Classified applicant mu st register for g raduate degree work at Saint Louis University within two calendar years (less in some fields) of the original acceptance. If a Classified student has registered at least once for coursew ork, and if more than three years have elapsed since the last registration, the student will be required to re -apply for admission. The fee for re -application is one -half of the initial application fee. Health Insur ance Saint Louis University requires full -time Undergraduate and Graduate/Professional students to have basic health insurance. Unless you waive health insurance via the Health Insurance Waiver Form , you will be charged for coverage, for all semesters and/or terms in which you are registered, under the University Health Plan (UHP) health ins urance plan sponsored by Saint L ouis University. Participating students must complete the University Health Plan Enrollment Application Form . Summer coverage is not required. Revised 11/16/11 12 Immunization Polic y All Classified graduate students must comply with the University's immunization policy. All incoming students must complete and submit the SLU Student Immun ization Record form, which is located on the Graduat e Admission Website. Admission Procedures The application p rocess is handled on -line. http://www.slu.edu/x32020.xml The following application documents are required: 1. Application form with accompanying a pplication fee 2. Official transcripts from all colleges and universities attended 3. Graduate Record Examination (GRE) if required by the program to which the student is applying (cf. http://www.slu.edu/graduate/admission_requirements.html ). If the GRE score is required, students must have an official score submitted (with their application ) by Educational Testing Service (ETS) . Certain programs also accept: MAT, MCAT, or LSAT. 4. Three letters of recommendation (preferably from recent instructors) 5. Resum\u00e9 or Curriculum Vitae (C.V.) 6. Professional goals statement 7. Possibly other specific documents, as required by the major field If Classified or Certificate status is sought, the desired major field or program must be indicated. An area of con centration or specialization may be requested. A formal minor may be proposed, but is not required of Classified applicants. Available minor fields generally include all fields in which a graduate degree is offered. The completed Classified or Certificate application form with the application fee must be submitted before the deadline set by the department or program. If an earlier date is not specified, the general deadlines are as follows: Summer: April 1; Fall: July 1; Spring: November 1. Each application for Classified status is evaluated initially by an admissions committee in the proposed major field (and, if applicable, subsequently in the proposed m inor field). The Associate Dean for Graduate Education or other designee of the particular school /colleg e/center receives the recommendation(s) of the committee(s) and is responsible for making the final decision and communicating it to the proposed major field and applicant. NOTE: Academic records , in English translation, of students who have undertaken p ostsecondary studies outside the United States must include the courses taken and/or lectures attended, hours of practical laboratory work, the maximum and minimum grades attainable, the grades earned or the results of all end -of-term examinations, and any honors or degrees received . WES and ECE transcripts are accepted as well. Applicants whose coursework is exclusively confined to Summer Sessions may seek admission only to specific non - research Master's degree programs. A post -baccalaureate student may p ursue only o ne advan ced degree at a time, except if admitted to one of several, specific, dual-degree programs. An applicant desiring to undertake a dual-degree program must separately apply, and gain admission, to both advanced degree programs. Matriculat ion Policies The matriculated Classified graduate student must maintain continuous enrollment during each nine -month academic year until graduation. The academic department (major field) determines whether or not graduate students must also enroll each sum mer. Alternatively, students in summers -only programs must register every summer until degree requirements are fully completed. The student violating the mandatory continuous -enrollment policy must pay a fee/penalty determined by the number of consecutive semesters not enrolled. If a student does not enroll for a period of three years or longer, a new application for admission will be required a long with a $20 application fee. Classified graduate students are expected to meet with their advisors at least on ce each semester. Students must have their advisor's permission to enroll in new academic work in anticipation of a new academic term. Students may register for zero credit -hour courses. Details regarding these enrollments c an be found in the zero -credit registration section of this catalog. Such a registration gives the student access to University libraries, computer centers, and other resources. A Classified graduate student may formalize an interruption in progress towards a degree by petitioning the ma jor-field chairperson and the Associate Dean for Graduate Education or other designee of the particular school/c ollege /center for a leave of absence. A leave period is generally for one calendar year. Students on approved leave of absence do not violate th e mandatory continuous enrollment policy during the leave period. However, three years or more with no academic progress results in automatic expulsion from the degree program. Students on approved leave do not have access to University resources. A Classi fied student may petition to change the degree sought, concentration, or to add or delete a formal minor. The Petiti on to Amend the Graduate Program is the proper document for such a request. Note that a new classified application is generally required to change major fields. A student may also petition to continue doctoral study immediately upon Revised 11/16/11 13 completion of a Master's degree in the same major field. The Petition for Admission into a Doctoral Degree Program is required in this instance. Petitions are made to the college, school, or center. All petition fo rms are available on -line at http://www.slu.edu/graduate/students_forms.html. Transfer of Credit The Classified student is expected to complete most degree requirements at SLU , but some advanc ed work taken elsewhere may be \"transferred,\" subject to specific university, college, school, or center restrictions. The student must initiate a petition and have an official transcript of the work proposed for transfer forwarded to the college/school/c enter. The advisor and major field makes a recommendation on the petition form, and the final decision res ts with the Associate Dean for Graduate Education or designee of the particular school/c ollege /center . Such a petition will not receive consideration until the student has completed a minimum of six semester hours toward the degree at SLU Ordinarily, work completed elsewhere more than five years prior to the beginning of the current SLU degree program will not be approved for transfer into the current program. For a course to qualify for transfer, the course must be applicable for inclusion in the advanced degree program and in the present major field of the student at the accredited institution where it was taken. The grade received must h ave been B (3.0 on a 4.0 scale) or higher. (Courses taken on a Credit/No Credit or Pass/Fail basis ordinarily will not be considered for transfer.) A conditional approval of transfer of credit may be obtained by the Associate Dean for Graduate Education or designee of the particular school/c ollege /center prior to the student's enrollment in the course(s) in question, but the petitioning process after completion of the coursework must still be undertaken. Final approvals of transfer of credit are documented by the University Registrar in the student's permanent records at the University. The Master's degree student must complete a minimum of 80% of the advanced work at SLU . For example, within a 30 credit -hour Master's program, a maximum of six se mester hours of work (20%) may be approved for transfer toward fulfillment of degree requirements. Work that was part of a Master's degree program completed elsewhere will not be approved for transfer, i.e., the same course may not be \"double counted\" in t wo separate Master's degree programs. Similarly, a graduate course taken in partial fulfillment of undergraduate degree requirements may not also be includ ed in a graduate degree program unless specified otherwise by a school, college, center, or program. The Ph.D. degree student must also complete a minimum of 80% or, if matriculating as a post -Master's student, at least 24 credit -hours of post -baccalaureate work at SLU in preparation for and in anticipation of preliminary degree examination s. The Ed.D. degree student must complete at least 38 semester hours of credit at SLU . Students admitted for doctoral study, having previously completed a Master's degree in the same or a comparable major field, may expect at least a portion of that prior work to be recognized as contributing to the overall advanced preparation for the doctorate, giving the student Advanced Standing. Academic Calendar s The University operates within a fiscal calendar that begins on July 1 and ends on June 30 . Most Colleges/Schools of the University follow an academic calendar that includes two semesters and a set of summer sessions. The \"year\" begins with the Summer Sessions and ends with University Commencement at the close of the Spri ng Semester. The graduate calendar consists of the Summer Sessions, which run from late May to mid -August, a Fall Semester beginning in late August and concluding in mid -December, and a Spring Semester that starts in January and closes in mid-May. The School of Medicine follows a three -trimesters -per-year calendar. TUITION AND FEES Tuition and fees are subject to change. The rates for the Fall and Spring semesters of the 2010 academic year are as follows: Click here for a com prehensive list of current (2011/12 ) tuition rates.

Revised 11/16/11 14 Payment of Tuition and Fees Payment of tuition, fees, and deposits (not co vered by financial aid awards) must be made after pre -registration for classes. Initial billing statements are mailed to the student's permanent address by the Office of Student Financial Services. Subsequent bil ling statements will be mailed to the student's local address, or, if specified, the permanent billing address. Students have the option of paying the balance in full or participating in a payment plan (see below). Payments must be received before the due date. (Post -marked dates are not applicable.) Payments are best made in pe rson to the Office of Student Financial Services (DuBourg Hall, Room 121) and must be accompanied by the top portion of the bill. Make all checks payable to Saint Louis University; the student's Banner number must appear on the face of the check. Cr edit card payments may be made with a convenience fee if the student is paying for the fall or spring term in full. Failure to make financial arrangements by the specified payment deadline will result in the registration being canceled. If the registration is canceled, no scholarships or financial aid can be paid to the student's account. In addition, a $50 fee will be charged to the student's account if reregistering during the late regist ration period. For the schedule of Madrid Campus tuition, fees, payment and refund information, see http://spain.slu.edu/admissions/tuition_and_fees.html. SLU Budget Plan (Fall and Spring ) The Budget Plan allows semester charges to be paid In four monthly installments each Fall and Spring Semester with a 1% per month finance charge. A minimum of 25% of the total tuition, fees, and room/board charges is due prior to the start of classes. The balance including the finance charge is payable in three equal installments due October 1, November 1, and December 1 in the Fall term, or March 1, April 1, and May 1 in the Spring term. The account must be paid in full before the next academic term. TMS 12 Payment Annual Plan Annual interest -free monthly payment plans are provided by Tuition Management Systems (TMS) with a full range of payment methods (check, on -line credit or debit card, on -line deduction from checking or savings account, and Western Union Phone Pay), and they include education life insurance at no additional charge. Advance enrollment is necessary, and the non -refundable enrollment fee ($90 or $120 for the 12 or 10-month plans, respectively) must be paid to TMS. The first interest -free payment is due May 1 or July 1, with subsequent payments due the first of every month. Contact TMS at www.afford.com or toll free at 1 (800) 343.0911. SLU Budget Plan (Summer) Financial arrangements for Summer Sessions are due on the published deadlin e in May for any enrollment combination except for exclusive Six -Week II courses. The required payment is 50% of total charges. Payment of the balance plus a $10 service charge is due July 1. Students enrolled exclusively in Six -Week II courses have a diff erent published deadline in June. Payment of the balance plus a $10 service charge is due August 1. Employer Billing Students whose employers pay tuition may use the Company Billing process. Contact the Office of Student Financial Services for information about procedures. If an employer reimburses students based on successful completion of coursework, the student is responsible for tuition payment at the time of registration. Student Financial Responsibility No s tudent is officially registered until payment or a satisfactory arrangement for payment has been made. All indebtedness to the University must be cleared promptly. Student account balances that are past due result in electronic \"holds\" that block future re gistrations and deny the issuance of official transcripts. No refund or reduction is allowed for absences. Withdrawals Students are responsible for formal with withdrawals from individual courses or other registrations. See \"Withdrawing from a Course, Ter m Work, or the University\" for regulations governing withdrawal.

Residen ce Hall charges will be refunded in accordance with the residence contract. The refund schedule for the Summer Sessions is published in the Summer Sessions Schedule of Classes. FINANCIAL AID To learn about financial aid, visit Student Financial Services at:http://www.slu.edu/x21861.xml Fellowships, Assistantships, and Scholarships Saint Louis University's fellowship, assistantship, and scholarship programs are made poss ible through University resources, grants, individual donors, corporations, foundations , and alumni. These awards are made on the basis of academic excellence. Graduate Assistantships Saint Louis University in St. Louis offers three categories of graduate assistantships. The assistantships offered include a range of stipends depending upon the degree level, the field of study, and the length of the appointment. These awards typically include tuition scholarships of nine credit hours per semester during the nine-month academic year. Recipients also generally receive health insurance. Assistants spend at least 15, but no more than 20 hours per week performing assigned duties. All Assistants must be Classified graduate students and remain in good standing . Assistants are expected to maintain a cumulative grade -point average of 3.0 during t he academic year of appointment. If the student's GPA falls below a 3.0 during any portion of the academic year, the student can be terminated by the department from the assistantship during that academic year. Assistantship Extensions Normally, the maximum number of years that a graduate student may hold an assistantship is two years while pursuing a Master's degree and five years in a Doctoral program. In the case of a student pursuing the Master's and Doctoral degree in the same major field, eligibility for funding is also normally limited to five years. A third year of funding for the Master's (thesis option only) or a sixth year for the Doctoral degree is possible pro vided funding through the department in question is available and the criteria established by the respective school/college are met. The appeal should be made during the spring semester of the second year of funding for the Master's or of the fifth year fo r the Doctorate to the Associate Dean for Graduate Education or the equivalent administrator of the particular school/college. No additional funding will be provided to implement. A Graduate Teaching Assistant may work with students in small groups, lead class discussions, monitor examinations and grade papers, help prepare lectures, conduct laboratory sessions, or even be responsible for a course as the primary instructor. Under the close supervision of the Facu lty, teaching assistants concurrently develop teaching skills and a deeper understanding of the discipline. A Graduate Research Assistant may be funded by the University or by an externally funded research projec t. In either case, the student is assigned a range of duties such as library searches, field work, laboratory experiments, and preparation of grant applications and proposals so as to gain professional skills in research which complement graduate education . A Graduate Assistant performs other duties that are not primarily teaching or research. These duties may include clinical, advising, or administrative responsibilities that are inherently related to the student 's educational and career objectives. Madrid Campus Assistantships Madrid Campus graduate assistantships take the form of tuition discounts only. These assistantships enable students to gain experience in areas of professional responsibility related to their field of study. Presidential Fellowships These fellowships include a stipend for an eleven -month appointment as well as 21 credit hours of tuition scholarship and health insurance. Dissertation Fellowship s Dissertation Fellowships are awarded in annual competitions to selected Candidates for the Ph.D. Each nine -month, academic -year fellowship award includes a stipend, twelve semester hours of tuition remission, a nd health insurance. Tuition Scholarships Revised 11/16/11 16 Many programs have a limited number of tuition scholarships available for students. These scholarships are frequently reserved for students with serious financial need. Health Sciences Graduate Fellowships Awards made in the medical sciences include stipends and tuition scholarships. These appointments are usually made for one year, but satisfactory progress toward the degree may lead to reappoint ment. External Fellowships Individual departments or programs may receive funding from sources external to the University that include s support of graduate stude nts. From such grants, students may be appointed t o fellowships or traineeships consisting of stipends and full tuition scholarships with the academic approval of the Dean or Director of the particular school/c ollege /center . Trainees will be required to participate in training experiences as demanded by t he grantor. Diversity Fellowships The Diversity Fellowship is designed to assist in achieving a more diverse population of graduate students. This initiative is consistent with SLU's Mission Statement and with i ts commitment to making graduate education more accessible to an inclusive variety of applicants. The Diversity Fellowship is awarded to a newly accepted Master's or doctoral student who has demonstrated outstanding scholastic achievement and potential for success in a graduate program . These fellowships include a stipend for an eleven -month appointment as well as 21 credit hours of tuition scholarship and health insurance. Private Sources Other fellowships are available from various agencies, professional organizations, foundations and corporations. Most of these awards may be taken by the student to the institution where admission is granted. Listings of such awards may be found in a variety of reference materials published by, for example, the Superintend ent of Documents, the National Science Foundation, the Department of Education, and the Council of Graduate Schools in Washington, DC, the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, MD, and Peterson's Guides in Princeton, NJ. Graduate Student Loans The Office of Student Financial Services administers federal and alternative bank -funded loan programs. Such programs are a cost -effective way to finance educational and living expenses. Most of these loans have low interest rates, and all defer repayment until after the completion of the student's graduate program of study. The Office of Student Financial Services encourages early application to better ensure funds availability for the academic terms for which the fi nancial assistance is sought. Short -Term Loan Fund The USX Foundation has provided a loan fund to particularly help students meet expenses at the beginning of an academic term, for travel to scholarly meetings, or to provide assistance in emergencies. The maximum amount to be borrowed is $1,200, and, if repaid in 90 days, the loan is interest free. These funds are available on a first -come, first -served basis to Classified students who are U.S. citizens and in academic good standing. Ordinarily, these loans will be granted a maximum of three times provided the previous ones have been repaid. Students may contact Student Financial Services to discuss their options. REGISTRATION Pre/Continuing/Late Registration Pre-registration periods for courses and other academic work for the Summer Sessions and the Fall and Spring Semesters are scheduled by the Office of the Registrar. At the end of those periods , the Office of Student Financial Services mails billing statements t o pre -registered students, and they must respond to the statements to confirm their registration. A period of Continuing Registration follows the Pre - registration period. Students enrolling during this period and thereafter are expected to complete the en tire process, including the making of financial arrangements with the Office of Student Financial Services. A \"late -registration fee\" may be charged to the student enrolling during the Late Registration period. Course registration made during the pre -registration period will be canceled if there is a balance due and no response to the billing statement. Similarly, registrations initiated during the Continuing or Late Registration periods will be canceled if financial arrangements are not made. Changes in Registrations No fee is assessed for a change in registration . Generally, academic work may not be added to or substit uted within the graduate student's program for the term or sess ion subsequent to the second full week of classes for the semester. More stringent time -lines exist during the Summer Sessions. Ordinarily, withdrawals from academic work may not occur after mid -term. Revised 11/16/11 17 Registration \"Holds\" The University may block the regis tration of a matriculated student by placing an academic \"hold\" on the student's re cord for one of several reasons (e.g. non -payment of tuition, library books not returned, violation of the mandatory conti nuous - enrollment requirement). The Student Health Service will also place registration \"holds\" in cases of violations of the immunization/health -history policy. Zero -Credit Registrations A Classif ied graduate student may include in the program for the academic te rm one or more zero credit -hour registrations. Often a journal club or colloquia registration , and in some instances practicum or internship enrollments, may be for zero credit. The student may be preparing for language or degree - examination(s), or may hav e taken the required total number of credits of Thesis or Dissertation Research within the ordinary time period to complete all degree requirements. The student may be completing the requirements for coursework that was initiated during a previous academic term. Zero -credit registrations, coded by 5CR and 6CR or 595 and 695 , are each permitted no more than twice during a degree program. Any registration, even if for zero credit hours, enables the student to have access to the academic resources of the Univ ersity. In no instance, however, should a student's record show a \"5CR\" or \"6CR\" registration during the degree examination or research phase of the academic program. Research -Phase Registrations Toward completion of requirements for a research degree, a Master's level student must enroll in a minimum of six credit hours of Thesis Research. Accumulation of these credits may begin after the student has completed the equivalent of one full-time semester of coursework at SLU The student pursuing the Ph.D. degree must accumulate a minimum of 12 credit hours of Diss ertation Research, and an Ed.D. student three credit hours of Project Guidance. Students are encouraged to distribute research registrations over several academic terms, taking numbers of hours per term commensurate with the anticipated intensity of research involvement. A registration of three research credit hours by itself is considered a full -time enrollment for a semester. Ordinarily, the minimum research registration for an academic term is one semester hour. Zero credit -hour registrations in Thesis or Dissertation Research are possible after the required credits have been accumulated (within the ordinary or extended time - to-degree period). By themselves, such enrollments make the registrants at least half -time students. If a student's degree program becomes protracted such that extensions of the ordinary time -to-degree period are necessary, approvals of such extensions of research -degree programs are ordinar ily accompanied by the req uirements of enrollment in additional research credits (or additional Project Guidance credits for students pursuing Ed.D. degrees). Inter -University Registrations Through mutual agreements with specific local academic institutions, including Washington Un iversity, University of Missouri -St. Louis, and several other institutions offerin g post-baccalaureate work, students may be permitted to enroll in courses offered at these locations for \"in -residence\" credit. The course must be 500 - or 600 -level or the eq uivalent at the \"visited\" institution and generally be in the student's major field. The student must be Classified and full -time for the academic term. Ordinarily, a maximum of the equivalent of one three -credi t course may be taken at the \"visited\" institution per academic term, and not more than six semester hours per degree program. A special, inter-university registration form, available from the University Registrar, must be completed for each such enrollmen t. Through special arrangements with the University, Aquinas Institute 's (AI) graduate courses are directly accessi ble to graduate students . Enrollments by students in AI coursework should be limited, the transfer -of-credit guidelines apply, and such regis trations are to be monitored by the major fields. Audits, Auditors, and Visitors Auditing a course as a Classified student must be approved by the academic unit offering the course. The tuition charge for auditing is $50 per credit hour . At the end of the academic term, the course instructor determines if the student has satisfactorily completed the aud it. If so, the designation \"AU\" is placed by the Registrar in the grade field for the course on the student's permanent record and, if n ot, a \" W\" is placed. No credit toward a degree is earned in an audited course. A change in status of a course from \"credit\" to \"audit\" may not be made after the m id-term. A change in course status from \"audit\" to \"credit\" will not be approved after the second week of the semes ter. An Auditor is an individual who enrolls for the academic term only to audit coursework. There is a $50 charge per credit hour for Auditors. The Visitor is a student taking coursework only for enrichment or for potential transfer of SLU credits into a degree program at another academic institution. The Visitor is admitted to the University only for the academic term, and is evaluated for eligibility for regi strations in individual courses by the academic units offering those courses. Categorically, Visi tor status exists only for the Summer Sessions. The Visitor desiring to take graduate -level academic work shoul d be admitted by Graduate Education Admissions . No fee is charged for such an admission. Revised 11/16/11 18 Registrations of Undergraduates in Graduate Coursework SLU undergraduate, degree -seeking students may be permitted to enroll in 500 or 600 -level coursework provided that specific conditions are met. First, the student must hold senior standi ng and have the majority of the major requirements already fulfilled. S econd, prerequisites for each course in question must have been completed. Third, the student's cumulative GPA must be minimally 2.7 on a 4 -point scale. Fourth, the total enrollment for the semester (or summer sessions) may not exceed 15 (six) credit hour s with not more than six (three) credits in 500 or 600 -level work. To be granted permission to take graduate coursework, the undergraduate must complete a formal petitioning process during which approvals of the course instructor, the student's major advis or, the undergraduate Dean, and the Associate Dean for Graduate Education or designee of the particular school/c ollege /center are obtained. As part of the petitioning process, the student must indicate that the graduate coursework is to be taken either to partially fulfill requirements for the baccalaureate degree or for \"advanced graduate credit.\" In the latter case, all major requirements must have been fulfilled. Approval to take and succes sful completion of the coursework do not, of themselves, guarant ee the student admission into the applicable advanced degree program or, in any way, amend the ordinary process of making application for Classifi ed status . Withdrawing from a Course, Term Work, or the University Withdrawal from an individual course or from the entire program of studies for an academic term must be undertaken formally by the student and through the completion of a Change -of-Registration form available from the University Registra r. Formalization of a withdraw al may entitle the student to a partial refund of tuition paid. Separate policies exist for students developing substantial physical or mental health problems or who are called to active U.S. military duty during the academic term. Those polic y statements are available from the University Registrar. Depending upon the reason for or the date of withdrawal, the registration(s) in question may be erased from the student's permanent record or a withdrawal indicator (\"W\") may be placed in the grade field(s) in the SLU record. Ordinarily, withdrawals are not permitted after mid-term. In addition to filing the Regi strar's form, a student on an assistantship appointment must submit a letter of resignation through the academic unit to which service is rendered to the Associate Dean for Graduate Education or designee of the particular school/c ollege /center . A Classified student withdrawing entirely (or taking a f ormal leave of absence) from a graduate program is required to submit a letter of resignation (or a petition for a leave), routing the letter or petition through the major field and to the Associate Dean for Graduate Education or designee of the particu lar school/c ollege /center . ACADEMIC STANDARDS Academic Work at the 400, 500, 600 and 700 Levels Academic work designated by 500, 600 or 700 level is, by definition, offered for \"graduate credit.\" To the extent applicable, students may obtain credit toward degrees for limited numbers of credit hours in 400 -level (upper -division , undergraduate ) course s. Limitations are given in the subsequent section on \"Graduation Requirements.\" Grading System The Grading Scale exclusive of Thesis or Dissertation Research is as follows: Undergraduates, Health Science Professional, and Masters in Social Work - Fall 200 5 - Present , Graduate and Other Professional - Summer 2011 - Present A 4 A- 3.7 B+ 3.3 B 3 B- 2.7 C+ 2.3 C 2 C- 1.7 D 1 F 0 AF 0 Failure due to excessive absence School of Law - Fall 1994 - Present A+ 4 A 4 A- 3.7 B+ 3.3 B 3 B- 2.7 Revised 11/16/11 19 C+ 2.3 C 2 C- 1.7 Fall 2007 - Present D 1 F 0 For most graduate level offerings carrying zero or one semester hour of credit, one of these two final grades is assigned: \"S\" Satisfactory \"U\" Unsatisfactory Neither of these two grades influences the student's term or cumulative GPA. (\"Pass/No Pass\" grading is not permitted .) For Thesis and Dissertation Research registrations, Project Guidance, and for Special Study for Examinations, one of these three grades is assigned at the end of the academic term: \"IP\" In Progress \"S\" Satisfactory \"U\" Unsatisfactory Toward fulfillment of the credit hours required for Thesis or Dissertation Research or Project Guidance, the grade of \"S\" may be assig ned only once: at the close of the final academic term at SLU during which the student has completed both the hours requirement and the thesis/dissertation/project itself. At the close of a prior term, if progress has been made, th e \"IP\" grade is appropriate. When a \"U\" grade is assigned, no credit toward fulfillment of the hours requirement is earned. Adjacent to a Special -Study -for-Examinations entry in the student record, \"IP,\" \"S,\" and \"U\" indicate that the exam was not taken, was passed, an d was failed, respectively. None of these three grades affects the student's term or cumulative GPA. At the end of a term for a course at any level that a student audits, the instructor assigns one of these two grades: \"AU\" Audit (satisfactory) \"W\" Authorized withdrawal (or unsatisfactory audit) Neither of these entries into the permanent record influences the student's term or cumulative GPA, or counts toward credit hours earned for degree. Withdrawal from a class between the end of the Late Regis tration period and mid -term, a designation of \"W\" is entered into the grade field for that entry in the permanent record. Withdrawals beyond the mid -term date are ordinarily not allowed . The following temporary course grades may be given: \"I\" All re quirements for the course have not been completed by the student by the close of an academic term. The \"Incomplete\" may remain in the permanent record for a maximum of 12 months and, if not amended by then, is transformed into an \"F\" (Failure). \"X\" Student is absent from the final examination. This grade must be rectified within six weeks of the end of the academic term, or it is replaced by the \"F\" grade. \"NR\" Student is enrolled in academic work for a term and may not be expected to complete requi rements by the close of that term. The notation \"NR\" means \"Not Recorded\" and remains in place until the instructor of record communicates a final letter grade to the Registrar. Grade Reports An electronic grade report is prepared for the student at the end of the academic term for which the student has completed a registration. The report is communicated to the student via Banner. In addition to grades for each end of a course, the report shows cumulative quality data for the term and for all graduate work taken to date. Graduate students do not receive mid-term grades. When an initially assigned temporary grade or an \"NR\" indicator is rectified to a permanent grade, the change appears in Banner. The SLU Permanent Record The permanent record at the Univer sity shows the courses taken and the grades received by the student. Also indicated are the previous degrees earned by the student and any academic work taken elsewhere that has been approved for transfer into a SLU degree program. A transcript is a copy o f the permanent record, certified as authentic and true by the Registrar. If and when the student earns a degre e and/or a certificate , that item is posted to the student's SLU record. A final GPA is computed for the academic w ork taken in the University . If a graduate student takes a specific course twice, both entries will appear in the record, but only one will be included in the work presented toward a degree. The quality points from both entries will be included in the GPA. Good Academic Standing and A cademic Probation A Classified student is in good academic standing when s/he is making progress toward a degree within the time period established for that degree. A student is not in good standing when s/he is on academic probation . Students are also no t in good standing if they have been formally dismissed from the University or placed under temporary suspension by action of Revised 11/16/11 20 the Dean or Director of the particular school/c ollege /center for academic deficiencies or academic misconduct. A student will not be advanced to candidacy or be eligible to graduate or continue an assistantship while not in good academic standing. If the cumulative GPA of a Classified student falls below 3.0 (on the four -point scale, \"B\" = 3.0), that student is automatically placed on academic probation (not to be confused with Probationary admission ). To continue degree pursuit, the student must progress toward a 3.0 cumulative average and is expected to emerge from academic probation within nine credit hours or two successive acade mic terms during which coursework registrations are recorded. A student will not be advanced to Candidate status while on academic probation. In general, doctoral students are expected to complete academic work at the \"B+\" level. A limited number of credi t hours in which the grade of \"C\" is earned may or may not be accepted toward a graduate degree at the discretion of the individual department or program. The Classified student's cumulative GPA in academic work presented to fulfill degree requirements must be at least 3.0. Acceptable Academic Progress/ Ordinary Time Periods to Degree The ordinary time period to degree for a Classified student begins at the start of the academic term when the first SLU course is taken to be included in the degree program. Accordingly, revision of the start of the time period is possible after matriculation if a course taken in Unclassified status is made part of the degree program through a successful petition to do so. For the student pursuing a Master's degree, the ordina ry time period to the degree is five years, and seven for the doctorate directly from the baccalaureate. For the student pursuing the doctorate, having previously been awarded a Master's degree in the same or a comparable major field, the ordinary time - period to degree is five years. Academic Integrity/ Ethical Behavior The University is a community of learning, and its effectiveness requires an environment of mutual trust and integrity. As members of this community, students share with faculty and admin istrators the responsibility to maintain this environment. Academic integrity is violated by any dishonesty in submitting an assignment, test, research report, or any other documentation required to validate the student's learning. In a case of clear indication of such dishonesty, the faculty member or administrator has the responsibility to apply sanctions to protect the environment of integrity. Although not all forms of academic dishonesty are given here, the i nstances listed below should be seen as actions that violate academic integrity: soliciting, receiving, or providing any unauthorized assistance in the completion of any work submitted; copying from another student; using electronic devices to share inform ation during an exam; copying from a book or class notes during a closed -book exam; submitting materials authored by or editorially revised by another person but represented as the student's own work; copying a passage or text directly from a published source without appropriately citing/recognizing that source; taking a test or doing an assignment or other academic work for another student; securing or supplying in advance a copy of an examination without the knowledge or consent of the instructor. Falsif ying or fabricating research data. Any clear violation of academic integrity will be met with sanctions. In a case of dishonesty within a course, the instructor may assign an appropriate grade and/or rec ommend further sanctions to the Dean or Director of t he particular school/c ollege /center , who is then responsible for the final decision and notification of all associated parties. The final decision of the Dean or Director may be appealed as described in \"Procedures for Academic Appeals.\" Ethical behavior is also expected of students and faculty in the academic setting and extending into professional life . Sexual harassment will not be tolerated and will be sanctioned. Most major fields require their graduate students to complete an ethics requirement with in the curriculum. Coursework or other training in ethical research is required of academic personnel involved in traineeship and investigative programs funded by a number of federal and other agencies. Click here for SLU's latest Codes of Student Conduct. Suspension/Dismissal The student who is judged guilty of an act of serious academic dishonesty may be susp ended for a specified time perio d or dismissed altogeth er. Suspension or dismissal may also be warranted for other reasons not listed above, e.g., unauthorized solicitation or distribution of controlled substances, endangering one's self or another person, or abusing alcohol or illicit drugs. Reports of such actions may come from nonacademic staff, faculty, administrators, or other students. Revised 11/16/11 21 Such reports are to be directed to the Dean or Director of the particular school/c ollege /center , who is responsible f or decisions to suspend or dismiss after completing the process outlined by the S/C/C . Procedures for Academic Appeals As a general policy, if a student desires to appeal any academic decision that appeal should first be made to the faculty member or facul ty committee involved and, if necessary thereafter, to the department or program chairperson, the Associate Dean or Director of the particular school/c ollege /center , and the Dean, in that order . Should the student wish to pursue an additional level of appe als, the case is taken to the Associate Vice President for Graduate Education who reviews the file to determine if the process was followed. The As sociate Vice President does not overturn a decision, but may send the case back to t he school/college/center if process was not followed.

Students may contact the offices in St. Louis or Madrid for assistance wi th physical, academic, and program accessibility. GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS Master's Degrees The gener al and minimum requirements for Master's degree study are explained below. For some Master's degree programs the requirements are more extensive and are giv en and explained in the Curricula and Courses section of this catalog and in their program handbook . Courses A minimum of 30 semester hours of academic work is required. For students pursuing the research option, six of the total credit hours to the degree must be in Thesis Research. The program of studies must form a united and coordinated whole, embracing a major field subject and, perhaps, a formal minor field. In research -degree programs, no less than hal f of the total hours required (exclusive of Thesi s Research) must be in the major field. All of the work must be of distinctly advanced character. The University will permit some 400 -level undergraduate courses to be included in the degree program. However, the maximum allowable total semester hours of credit of such coursework is ten. Also, at least half of the work in the major field (again, exclusive of Thesis Research) must be strictly graduate (500, 600 , or 700 ) level. Non-research degree programs may be planned with somewhat greater flexibility. A m inimum of 30% of the credits must be in the major field and half of the total program must be directly related to the major field. Again, no more than ten credits in total may be taken at the 400 level. The minimum requirement for a formal minor at the Mas ter's degree level is six semester hours at SLU . No more than three credits within the minor may be taken at the 400 level. Ordinarily, no Master's degree program may include more than six credit hours in Research Topics (597) or Graduate Readi ng (598), or a combination thereof. Master's degree students may not enroll in tutorials carrying the course - numbers 497 or 498. Research -Tools Requirement Individual Master's degree programs may have a requirement of translation proficiency in a foreign language, statistics, computer literacy, or the like. Students seeking translation skills are encouraged to enroll in courses in the Department of Modern and Classical Languages designed specifically for them. Research -tool proficiency may be demonstrated through examination if permitted by the major field. Arrangements for administration of such an exam are the responsibility of the major field. Residency Except for students in the School for Professional Studies, each full -time Master's degree student mus t devote at least one calendar year or the equivalen t to their program of study . For part -time students, th ree years is generally the norm. Following admission to Classified status, the student in active pursuit of the Master's degree must maintain contin uous enrollment during the nine -month academic year. If the student is following a program leading to the non - Revised 11/16/11 22 research Master's degree to be completed through attendance during Summer Sessions exclusively, s/he adheres to the mandatory -continuous -enrollmen t policy by being at SLU every summer (unless a formal petition for a temporary leave of absence is approved by the major field and the Associate Dean or designee of the particular school/c ollege /center ) until degree requirements are fulfilled. Advancement to Candidacy The Master's degree student anticipating the final academic term in residence must file an application for degree . The application must be completed, by a set date in that final term. Subsequently, the student receives a candidacy packet that includes information to be reviewed and checked by the student and the advisor. If a research degree is sought, the thesis proposal must be prepared, receive major -field approval, and be filed with the Master's Candidacy Advisor as part of the candidacy process. Following filing of the cited materials and favorable action by the Associate Vice President for Graduate Education , a student in good academic standing becomes a Candidate for the Master's degree. Students seeking non -research degrees by attendance exclusively during Summer Sessions should initiate the candidacy process before the beginning of the final at SLU. Thesis The Candidate for a research Master's degree must write a thesis that reflects thorough knowledge o f the subject field, the power of independent thought, and the completion of original research. Graduate Education requires the formal appointments of three Graduate Faculty readers of the thesis, one of which is the student's mentor. The acceptable thesi s must be approved in writing by all three readers. A student ordinarily may not circulate the thesis among the approved faculty readers during the summer months. Likewise, a student should not expect conferral of a research Master's degree during or at th e end of the Summer Sessions. Exceptions may be granted on individual bases, but only with prior approval of the student's candidacy committee and the major field chairperson or director. Research Master's degree students must formally enroll for six credi t hours of Thesis Research within the ordinary time period to the degree. The written work must follow a composition format within guidelines established by the major field and the Formatting Guide. The Master's Candidacy Advisor completes a format evaluat ion of the thesis and abstract. The student will then submit the abs tract to ProQuest at (www.etdadmin.com/slu). Essay In some Master's degree programs, a scholarly essay, pertaining to so me phase of the major field discipline, is required for the non -research degree. Such a requirement is determine d by the major field, not by the University . Comprehensive Degree Examination Ordinarily during the final academic term at SLU , the Master's degree student must take and pass a comprehensive oral examination. The Master's degree student is required to register for Special Study for Examination (zero credit) during that term. A Master's degree student may enroll not more than twice in Special Study for Examination without permission of the Associate Dean . Advancement to candidacy must precede this examination. The examination is administered by a committee of three or more faculty recommended by the major -field chairperson and approved by the Associate Vice President for Graduate Education . The final examination covers the major field and, if formalized, the minor field as well. The student fails the examination if not given satisfactory evaluations by two of the three examiners. Offic ial transmission of the outcome of the examination is by letter to the Candidate and from the Associate Vice President for Graduate Education . If the student fails the comprehensive oral examination, the examination may be repeated, but only once, provided that a second exam is recommended by the committee and is approved by the Dean . Ordinarily, a second examination will not be scheduled during the same academic te rm as the first . Ordinary Time to Degree The entire Master's degree program, exclusive of prerequisites, is expected to be completed within a five -year time period, beginning with the academic term of the first course applicable to the degree. Students pursuing degrees by attendance only during the Summer Sessions are expected to complete all requ irements for their non -research degrees within a period of six consecutive summers. Should the five years (or six summers) pass without the student completing all degree requirements, that student ceases to be in good academic standing unless s/he petition s a successful extension to be approved by the Dean or Director of the particular school/c ollege /center and the Associate Vice President for Graduate Education . Extensions are usually granted for no longer than one calendar year at a time. Ordinarily, for a student pursuing a research degree, each extension carries with it the requirement of registration for one additional credit hour (beyond the required six credits) of Thesis Research. The student taking a non -research Master's degree and exceeding the ti me-to-degree limit must also petition an extension and is required to take an additional credit -hour per year until completion. Additional Departmental Requirements In addition t o these general requirements , each department or major field may, with the approval of Graduate Education , set Revised 11/16/11 23 additional requirements that are pertinent to the particular area of study. The Specialist in Education Degree The Ed.S. degree program, offered through the Department of Educatio nal Leadership and Higher Education, is designed for the educator/practitioner seeking administrative certification at the elementary, middle, junior high, senior high, or school - district level. The viable applicant must possess, prior to matriculation, an appropriate Master's degree. Requirements for the Ed.S. degree incl ude completion of a minimum of 3 0 semester hours of post -baccalaureate study, at least 30 of which must be taken at Saint Louis University. For additional descriptive information about thi s program, see the Curricula and Courses section of the catalog under the Department of Educational Leadership and Higher Education. The Doctor of Education Degree The Ed.D. degree program is preparation for educ ational - leadership roles through broadly based coursework and an extensive project focusing on practical needs within the major field. The successful applicant possesses a Master's degree in education or a related field, or an Ed.S. degree, and must comple te, at SLU, a body of post -Master's academic work, much of it in the Department of Educational Leadership and Higher Education. The degree includes research preparation, practica, and internship experiences. Mandatory continuous enrollment is required duri ng the nine -month academic year throughout the period of formal pursuit of the Ed.D. More extensive and detailed descriptions of the Ed.D. degree program are given in the Curricula and Courses section of the catalog under the Department of Educational Lead ership and Higher Education and in the program handbook . The Doctor of Philosophy Degree Applicants having superior previous academic records and showing strong potential for continued academic study and research may be admitted to pursue the Ph.D. degree . In some major fields, applicants possessing the Bachelor's degree may be admitted for direct study toward the doctorate. In others, requirements for the appropriate Master's degree must have been completed. Coursework For the admitted student holding an a ppropriate Master's degree, the additional preparation for preliminary degree examinations generally will be approximate ly 24-30 credit hours. After t he student has been enrolled at SLU for an academic term, s/he may petition for \"advanced standing\" and formal recognition of the applicability to the doctoral program of that academic work completed elsewhere. If the Master's degree was obtained at SLU, this is not necessary. Additional graduate -level academic work, not part of any earned advanced degree, may be formally transferred into the doctoral program, but a minimum of 24 credit -hours of advanced academic work, prior to the research phase of the program, must be completed as a SLU doctoral student. For the student admitted to pursue the Ph.D. degree di rectly from the baccalaureate, the total cr edit hours required prior to preliminary degree -exams may be as few as 48. See the Curricula and Courses section of the catalog and the program handbook for requirements in specific fields. A formal minor at the d octoral level may be possible and must include at least 12 credit hours of post -baccalaureate work in the minor field; a minimum of nine of those hours m ust be strictly graduate level. If the student pursues a certificate, it ordinarily requires completio n of minimally 15 credit hours, but a portion of those credits may also partially satisfy requirements for the degree sought. Ordinarily, no doctoral program may include more than 20% of the coursework in preparation for preliminary degree examinations in Research Topics (697) or Graduate Reading (698), or a combination thereof. Graduate degree students are not permitted to take 400 -level tutorials (identified by the course number 497 or 498). Research -Tools Requirements Such r equirements are not imposed as a whole because of variable needs across major fields. Most doctoral programs prescribe levels of competence to be attained in foreign language translation, statistics, computer literacy, or other tools of research. Students seeking translation skills are encouraged to enroll in courses in the Department of Modern and Classical Languages designed specifically for them. All research -tool competencies are generally to be developed in addition to the ordinary academic work required for the degree and may be demonstrated through examination if permitted by the major field. Residency Each doctoral degree student is expected to spend at least one academic year or its equivalent in full -time pursuit of the degree although more time may be necessary. The minimum tenure in this regard is one full semester and a contiguous summer session. The studen t in active pursuit of the doctorate must maintain continuous enrollment during the nine -month academic year. Preliminary Degree Examinations Each doctoral program will a dminister a written degree examination consistent with the expectations of the academic discipline. In some programs, a qualifying examination will be administered relatively early in the student's doctoral studies. In other programs, the written examinati on is structured to assess comprehensive knowledge of the discipline after all or Revised 11/16/11 24 nearly all of the student's academic work has been completed. Written examinations will also be administered in the minor field of study if a student has declared a formal mi nor. The results of the written examinations are communicated by letter to the Associate Vice President for Graduate Education in care of the Doctoral Candidacy Advisor. If the student's performance is satisfactory, the department chairperson recommends a committee of five members of the Graduate Faculty to administer the oral examination. Oral Examination An oral examination is scheduled in advance of the formalized research phase of the student's program and after the Associate Dean approves the examinati on committee. This examination may evaluate broad knowledge of the field or it may be largely focuse d on the dissertation proposal (usually consisting of a statement of the problem, literature review, and the research design prepared for the investigation) if the student's written preliminary degree -exam was comprehensive. At the end of the examination and before the committee is dismissed, the members of the examination committee independently complete confidential ballots evaluating the student's performa nce. These sealed ballots are then delivered to the Ass ociate Vice President for Graduate Education in care of the Doctoral Candidacy Advisor. The Associate Vice President for Graduate Education formally communicates the outcome of the examination in writi ng to the student. Once the oral examination is successfully completed, the Doctoral Candidacy Advisor will prepare and deliver to the student all necessary forms for advancement to candidate status. A student receiving two or more unfavorable evaluations fails the examination. Upon authorization by the Associate Dean , the oral examination may repeat once. Ordinarily, the second attempt should not be scheduled within the same academic term as the first. The committee that administered the first exam will al so administer the second examination under ordinary circumstances. The major -field chairperson will submit a written request for a second examination to the Associate Dean or Director well in advance of the desired date of that exam. Should the outcome of the second examination be unsatisfactory, a t hird exam is rarely approved . Advancement to Candidacy A formal prospectus setting forth the anticipated dissertation title and subject matter of the proposed investigation, recommendations of minimally three fa culty readers of the dissertation, one of whom functions as mentor, and the application for candidacy must be filed with the Doctoral Candidacy Advisor after the student has passed the oral degree examination. This filing must not be delayed and is to occu r before the substance of the dissertation research is undertaken. Some departments or major fields require a formal prospectus presentation. If the proposed research involves laboratory animals, the Animal Care Committee (ACC) of the University must revie w and approve the research design. If the intended investigation is to involve human subjects or their personal property (including archived matter), the research design and, if necessary, informed -consent materials must be submitted to the appropriate Ins titutional Review Board (IRB) of the University. Approval(s) must be secured before the gathering of data may begin and must also be submitted along with other candidacy application materials. Upon submission of the materials outlined above, the student is advanced to the status of Candid ate, and is informed in writing. Doctoral students anticipating degree conferral at University Commencement ceremonies in May should formally become Candidates before the end of the preceding Fall Semester. Dissertation The ability to extend the knowledge base in the major field is a qualification distinctive to the Ph.D. degree. A Candidate for this most advanced degree must present substantial evidence of this ability by presenting and defending a piece of original and ind ependent research on a topic of importance that has been previously unresolved within the major field. Twelve semester hours of Dissertation Research are required of each student pursuing the Ph.D. Only after accumulating the total semester hours required may the student register for zero Dissertation Research credit. The written work must follow a composition format within guidelines established by the major field and the Formatting Guide. The Master's Candidacy Advisor completes a format evaluation of t he thesis and abstract. The student will then submit the abstract to ProQuest at (www.etdadmin.com/slu). Public Presentation and Defense of the Dissertation Across all m ajor fields, Graduat e Education requires a public, oral presentation and defense of the dissertation . The presentation should be scheduled after all Graduate Faculty readers have approved the general content of the dissertation. A Notification of Readiness form and a final dr aft paper copy of the dissertation with the abstract (for format review) must be submitted to the Doctoral Candidacy Advisor well in advance of (minimally three weeks) the presentation date. Candidates anticipating May gr aduation must submit the aforement ioned materials no later than the da te set in the Calendar of Deadlines supplement to the University Calendar. Following the presentation, the Candidate should expect questions from the readers and the assembled audience. The dissertation -committee chairpe rson serves as the moderator for the defense. At the conclusion, the readers may evaluate the performance of the Candidate, but the dissertation ballots are not signed individually until each committee member fully approves the dissertation. Time -Period t o Degree and Extensions of Time Revised 11/16/11 25 If the time in the degree program exceeds the five or seven years and doctoral requirements remain, the student must formally petition for an extension of the ordinary time period, providing a justification and calendar for completion , routing the petition through the mentor to the major -field chairperson or the gradua te program director, Assoc iate Dean and finally the Associate Vice President for Graduate Education. Generally, when such petitions are approved, extensions are given for one calendar year at a time for a maximum of three years . Any extension petitions beyond three years will be scrutinized very carefully. I n part because such petitions typically occur during the research phase of the degree program, each s uch ap proval is also accompanied by the requirement of enrollment in one additional Dissertation Research credit (beyond twelve, which should have already been taken). (For Ed.D. students, the requirement of one additional credit -hour in Project Guidance accompa nies each approval of a one -year extension.) Furthermore, if the time period has been exceeded to the extent that more than five calendar years have elapsed since preliminary degree examinations were passed, to remain active in the doctoral program the stu dent will be required to retake the preliminary examinations to demonstrate currency in the major field, and, if appropriate, the minor field as well. The Multidisciplinary Doctoral Option After having been formally and unconditionally admitted into an ex isting Ph.D. degree program and initiated doctoral studies, the Classified graduate student may decide to petition for transfer into the Multidisciplinary Doctoral Option. Because the availability of academic resources to support a multidisciplinary progra m must be critically investigated a nd reviewed, the Associate Dean or Center Director reserves final approval of this option. The Multidisciplinary Option is not available at the Master's level or toward another advanced degree. To begin the transfer proce ss, the student prepares a draft of a proposal that describes the multidisciplinary program envisioned. The title of the student's multidisciplinary program must be distinctly different from the departments and major fields of doctoral study at Saint Louis University. In particular, the draft must contain the rationale for the transfer, the full complement of applicable, post -baccalaureate academic work proposed, i.e. that already completed as well as the work yet to be taken, and the general area of disse rtation research. With the proposal draft in hand, the student proceeds to select minimally five members of the Graduate Faculty to serve as a committee that, in effect, becomes the student's department or major field. To serve on the committee or not is the invited faculty member's option. A proposed chairperson of the committee is designated. At least one, and preferably a minimum of two, members of the com mittee must have authorization to direc t doctoral dissertations (i.e. Mentor Status). A formal petit ion to transfer into the option, signed individually by all of the proposed committee members, must be submitted to the Associate Dean(s) and/or Center Director(s) Associate Vice President for Graduate Education . The petition with appropriate supporting doc umentation from the student's academic file is then transmitted to the proposed committee chairperson for evaluation of the student's preparedness for and potential for academic success in the envisioned program. By this time the proposal draft should have been critiqued by the committee and subsequently revised to reflect their evaluative comments. If the recommendation from the proposed committee chairperson for approval of the transfer is positive, the petition (including the proposal) is reviewed by th e Graduate Academic Affair Committee (GAAC). The Associate Vice President for Graduate Education is the liaison to GAAC on behalf of the student, who should meet with the liaiso n at least once before GAAC considers the petition and proposal. The entire co urse of stud y will be reviewed toward approval by the Associate Vice President for Graduate Education . GAAC may annually review each multidisciplinary doctoral program and the progress therein, and make recommendations to the Associate Vice President for G raduate Education. In addition to coursework, the program must include written and oral preliminary degree examinations to be administered by the committee in accordance with Graduate Education policy and regulations. Research -tool requirements are to be set as appropriate. The rules and r egulations for advancement to candidacy also must be followed by the students pursuing this doctoral option. Dual -Degree Programs There are a number of formally established, advanced dual- degree programs . Within such a program, the student pursues two post -baccalaureate degrees concurrently . Separate applications must be made for the individual degree programs, and admission to pursue one of the degrees does not guarantee admissi on to the dual -degree program. A practical reason for the student to pursue a specific pair of advanced degrees concurrently is the sharing of some coursework requirements. The applicant should apply to the more competitive of the two programs first. The individual major -field components of a dual -degree program must be initiated reasonably close together in time such that appropriate integration of the individual programs takes place. The Directors of the two programs determine the necessary proximity of start dates in individual instances. Master in Health Administration (M.H.A. / Master's in Business Administration (M.B.A.) Master in Public Administration (M.P.A.) / Law (J.D.) Revised 11/16/11 26 Master in Urban Affairs (M.U.A.) / J.D . M.H.A./J.D. Master of Public Health (M.P.H.) / J.D Ph.D. in Health Care Eth ics / J.D.

M.P.H. / Masters of Science in Nursing (M.S.N.) M.S.P.H. / Ph.D. in Psychology M.P.A / M.A. in Political Science M.P.H. (Health Policy)/J.D. Applicants or current students possibly interested in a dual - degree program should contact the administrative personnel i n the two individual degree programs for additional information and advice, or refer to the brief summaries of the dual -degree programs found in the Curricula and Courses section of this catalog. Certificate Programs There are several categories of post -baccalaureate certificate programs . For example, nursing or counseling professionals with a Master's degree may seek academic qualification in an additional specialty or for licensure via post -Master's certificate programs. Specific application protocols, not unlike those for Classified status, are in place. The requirements for these certificates may be found in the Curricula and Courses section of this catalog. A Certificate in University Teaching Skills may be e arned by graduate students through the Reinert Center for Teaching Excellence. There are also opportunities in which a Classified graduate student may pursue a certificate concurrent with an d parallel to seeking a post -baccalaureate degree. The objective is to improve the student competencies through inclusion of a series of courses that collectively focus on a particular area of study related to the broader degree. Admission to a parallel certificate requires a formal petition. The certificate generally demands sati sfactory completion of a minimum of 15 credit hours, and the program culminates with a capstone requirement. The majority of the certificate coursework may also partially fulfill requirements for the graduate degree. Several such specific certifica te programs have been developed. COURSES AND CURRICULA Introduction This part of the Catalog starts with the collegiate units of the University within which Graduate Education reside s. Within each colleg iate unit, the major fields of graduate degree study are individually described. Exceptions are four departments, each of which is responsible for more than one distinct graduate program: Earth and Atmospheric Sciences (Geosciences: Geophysics, Geology, an d Meteorology); Modern and Classical Languages (French, Spanish); Public Policy Studies (Public Administration, Public Policy Analysis, Urban Affairs, Urban Planning and Real Estate Development); and Theological Studies (Historical Theology, Theology). Each major -field subsection contains the names of the primary administrator(s) of the program, a brief overall description of the program, specific prerequisites, required courses, additional requirements for each available degree, and a listing in numerical order of the 500 through 800 -level courses that graduate students may take for graduate credit. Descriptions of the 400 -level courses are not given. The reader is referred for such descriptions to the undergraduate catalog of the University. In general, n ot every requirement for the degree is indicated within each program description. The requirements not given are those common to all programs and required by Graduate Education (and detailed in the General Requirements section of the Catalog). The Univers ity's course code has a three -part structure: 1) the subject abbreviation, 2) the course number, and 3) the section number. Graduate credit may be earned upon completion of specific individual courses numbered 400 through 899. The level of these courses is understood as follows: 400 level: upper -division/beginning graduate 500 level: introductory/intermediate graduate 600 level: advanced graduate 700, 800 levels: professional/certificate Graduate Education permit s, subject to approval by the Gradua te Academic Affairs Committee (GAAC) , the double - numbering of courses involving two levels of academic work. A course may exist at both the 400 and 500 levels or at both the 500 and 600 levels. For such a course, the requirements and expectations differ wi th the course level. Both undergraduate and graduate students could conceivably take a 400/500 -level course, but the undergraduate may not register for it at the 500 level withou t permission from the Dean or Director and the Associate Dean for Graduate Education of the particular School/College. A graduate student may not enroll in it at the 400 level. A doctoral student might register for a 500/600 -level course under the 600 number, whereas a student seeking a Master's degree would likely take it at the 50 0 level. A Graduate School student may not take a course for credit at both the 500 and 600 levels. Such courses should be numbered with the last two digits identical at both levels. Numbers in the 90's at the 500 and 600 levels refer to generic forms of academic work at the Master's and doctoral levels. Specifically, the numbers, generic titles, and credit hours are as follows: 590: Introduction to Graduate Study (0 -1) Revised 11/16/11 27 591-691: Journal Club (0 -1) 592-692: Colloquium (0 -1) 593-693: Special Topics (1 -3) 594-694: Internship (0 -6) 595-695: Special Study for Examinations (0) 596-696: Essay/Project Guidance (0 -3) 597-697: Research Topics (1 -3) 598-698: Graduate Reading Course (1 -3) 599: Thesis Research (0 5CR: Master's Degree Study [Section 690: Introduction to Doctoral Study (0 -1) 699: Dissertation Research (0 -6) 6CR: Doctor of Education Degree Study [Section 97] (0) Graduate Offerings in the College of Arts and Sciences Michael Barber , S.J., Collegiate Dean The College of Arts and Scienc es, established in 1818, is the oldest academic division of the University. The primary objective of the College is to impart a liberal undergraduate course of studies designed to educate the whole per son. The College includes twelve departments in the humanities and the natural sciences within which graduate work is offered at the Master's and Doctoral levels. AMERICAN STUDIES Matthew J. Mancini, Ph.D., Department Chairperson The Department of the A merican Studies provides a systematic interdisciplinary approach to the historical study of the cultures of the United States, and to the critical analysis of their ongoing evolution. Within the framework of the great Jesuit humanist tradition, the America n Studies Department trains students in the skills of clear thinking, writing and speaking, as well as the abilities associated with interpreting literary texts, evaluating historical documents and artifacts, applying humanistic and social science methods and theoretical approaches, and reflecting morally about the problems and issues they address in the classroom.

The curriculum includes the study of culture, langua ge, and the literature of England, North America, Ireland, Scotland, and the postcolonial world. Specialization in rhetoric and composition is also available. An essential component of the program is the study of literary theory; students also have the opportunity to undertake interdisciplinary work, including analysis of other literatures, cultures, and fields. The Department is committed to providing a curriculum that includes the full range of texts and methods important to the interpretation of literatu re and language, as well as offering students personalized instruction geared to their professional goals. Master of Arts Master of Arts (Research) Prerequisites B.A. degree in English or 18 credit -hours of upper -division college courses in English. Required Courses Students are required to complete 30 credit -hours in English. Six credit -hours may be taken at the 400 -level. Students in the Master of Arts (Research) program write a thesis in lieu of 6 credit -hours of coursework. ENGL.500 Methods of Litera ry Research, or ENG.A511 Literary Theory; and ENGL.501 The Teaching of Writing, or its equivalent. (Required of those who teach writing classes offered by the Department.) Additional Requirements The final oral examination covers a set of texts from a lis t provided at the beginning of the program. Both the non -research and research options of the M.A. degree program are also offered on the Madrid campus. Students who enroll in Madrid are required to spend one semester in residence on the Frost campus in St . Louis and to take two courses while they are there. Students who complete the SLUMadrid program will also receive the M.A. degree from Universidad Autonoma de Madrid. Advancement to the Doctorate: Admission to the doctorate is made by separate applicati on, in the spring of the master's candidate's second year. Students seeking admission to the doctorate from the master's program must complete a written project testifying to their sustained ability to work independently. This requirement can be satisfied in one of two ways. If they wish, students in their second year may write a Master's Thesis; at the completion of this two -semester process, the candidate graduates with an M.A.(Research) degree. Alternately, students contemplating advancement to doctoral study can complete a Master's Essay in one semester. Written under the direction of a faculty member chosen by the student, the Master's Essay is shorter than a thesis but nevertheless testifies to the student's ability to independently frame and complete an article -length project (roughly 25 -30 pages) of their own design. Students writing a Master's Essay must register for 3 hours of ENGL 598 (a Graduate Reading Course) in the semester in which they undertake this project. Doctor of Philosophy Prerequisi tes An M.A. degree in English, or 30 credit -hours in course -work in English beyond the B.A. Required Courses Students are required to take a minimum of 24 credit -hours in Revised 11/16/11 44 English coursework beyond the M.A. Six credit -hours may be taken in English courses at the 400 -level. ENGL.500 OR ENGL.511 is required of all students who have not taken the equivalent in another program at another university as part of their prior training. Additional Requirements Prior to the doctoral examination, the student must pass a two hour translation test in a modern foreign language relevant to the chosen area of concentration. Students seeking a specialization in Medieval or Renaissance English must also pass a two -hour translation test in Latin or classical Greek. Students wi ll take six -hour written and two -hour oral examinations in their chosen areas of concentration. In consultation with a faculty advisor each student selects one of two available examination structures: a major period and two minor areas, or a major specialt y and one minor area. For either structure, the examination will be based upon approved reading lists that include at least 90 primary works. The topic of the dissertation must be formally submitted to andapproved by the dissertation committee in a one -hour dissertation prospectus review.

In short, this course will hopefully teach you how, when and why to apply nonparametric \"sadistic statistics\" to real problems. THEOLOGICAL STUDIES Jay M. Hammond, Ph.D. Department Chairperson Julie Hanlon Rubio, Ph.D. Director of M.A. Program Jay M. Hammond, Ph.D. Director of Ph.D. Program The department offers two degrees. The MA in Theology has three areas of specialization: Constructive Theology, Religious Education, and Historical Theology. The PhD in Historical Theology has three areas of specialization: Early Christianity, Medieval Christianity, and Modern Christianity. Master of Arts in Theology The M.A. in Theology brings together two, complementary poles of theological reflection: retrieva l and appropriation . On the one hand, the program equips students with the methodological and conceptual tools necessary for understanding classic theological texts within their historical, cultural, and ecclesial contexts. This emphasis on retrieval not only allows for a greater appreciation of the rich and varied traditions out of which contemporary theological reflection emerges; it also gives students a better grasp of the context sensitive character of all human understanding. On the other Revised 11/16/11 65 hand, the pr ogram brings classic theological texts into critical conversation with our contemporary setting. This emphasis on appropriation provides students opportunities and skills to think creatively and practically about the ongoing impact of theological reflectio n, both in the search for human meaning and the task of personal and social transformation. While each of the three tracks retains distinguishing characteristics and requirements, all three tracks gain an internal coherence through integrating these two po les. This integration process is the chief goal of the Theological Sources and Methods Seminar required of all MA students. This seminar introduces students to the major sources and methods for thinking theologically at the graduate level. With a triple e mphasis on historical methods, theological hermeneutics, and practical theology, the seminar provides students the opportunity to understand and to begin practicing the interrelated tasks of theology. Prerequisites An undergraduate major in theology is th e standard prerequisite for the MA in Theology. However, the Department may admit students who have had at least 18 hours in Theology (or Religious Studies with a strong theological component). The overall concern is that each MA student has the basic know ledge and skill set to succeed in a graduate program in theological studies. Deficiencies may be satisfied through specific, intensive, prerequisite courses offered by the Department of Theological Studies. Applicants with an undergraduate major in the hum anities (with a strong liberal arts background) may also apply, although in these cases a greater number of prerequisite courses may be required in their first year. Required Courses : 36 hours The MA consists of three tracks from which students may choos e upon enrollment. Track # 1: Constructive Theology This track is designed to train students in the craft of constructive theology in a manner that is both historically conscious and ethically -engaged . With a backbone of course offerings in constructive t heology (e.g., Christology, Anthropology, Ecclesiology, and God), students take accompanying courses in historical theology, theological ethics, and scripture to deepen their understanding of the historical roots and practical implications of theological reflection. The constructive theology track consists of a 36 -hour, two year program of study: Theological Resources and Methods (3 hours) Constructive Theology (6 hours) Theological Ethics (6 hours) Historical Theology ( 6 hours) Scripture (6 hou rs) Elective (3 hours) (6) MA Thesis or (6) Additional Elective hours MA Thesis: The MA thesis in Constructive Theology (50 -70 pages) for a total of 6 credit hours.

Graduate Offerings in Parks College of Engineering, Aviation, and Technology K. Ravindra, Ph.D., P.E., Interim Collegiate Dean Phil Ligrani, Ph.D. Graduate Program s Director Consistent with the mission of Saint Louis University, the mission of Parks College is t o prepare students to advance the frontiers of knowledge and technical expertise in engineering and aviation while instilling within them good ethical and professional character. History Oliver L. Parks founded Parks College, the first federally certifie d school of aviation in the United States , in 1927 in Cahokia, Illinois . After establishing a strong aviation program, the school's founder entrusted his legacy to Saint Louis University in 1947. Now, Parks College offers a variety of engineering and aviat ion programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Program Objectives The graduate program emphasizes quantitative extension of knowledge in the core area of engineering and aviation with additional specialization tailored to the interests of the graduate student. The program emphasizes familiarization with the methods and techniques of scientific investigation through research, evaluation of knowledge in an independent and critical fashion, and communication of knowledge, through written and oral me ans. The program is designed to advance the careers of working engineers, as well as provide graduate education to students at the Master of Science and Ph.D. degree levels. Master of Science Required Courses The College offers a Master of Science degree in engineering and a Master of Science degree in aviation with three options: a. courses only option, b. project option , c. thesis option . The mini mum requirement for all Master of Science degrees in engineering is 30 credit hours, including up to nine credit hours for thesis research or a project. Faculty advisor s may tailor individual curriculum to satisfy the r esearch goals of the students. Industry professionals may complete a course only degree, with 30 credit hours of course work. Up to 9 credit hours may be comprised of coursework at the 400 level. The remaining course work credits must be at the 500 or 600 level. The Master of Science in a viation requires a total of 32 credit hours, and research faculty will want their students to take speci fic courses that support their t hesis research. The variable credit hour requirements for thesis or p roject allows flexibility in meeting the needs of students with a variety of backgrounds. The traditional model for a research Ma ster of Science degree inclu des 6 -9 credit hours of t hesis research. Within the se minimum requirements, individual faculty advisors may impose additional requirements or specific course requirements. Revised 11/16/11 96 Degree Plan Each new graduate student writes a Program of Study that must be approved by the faculty advisor and the Graduate Programs Director. That document will be prepared and reviewed in the context of the student's background and the student's career goal s. In that flexible approach, eac h student will determine, with f aculty advice and approval, a unique set of cours es and a specific plan for the thesis or project. This approach can accommodate students who want to continue for a Ph.D. degree, students who want to go into industry with a M.S. degree, and students who want to integrate other areas into their degrees - areas like b usiness, the basic sciences, or other areas that fit into the student's individual career plans. The number of allowed transfer cr edit hours to the Master of Science graduate program is limited to 12 credit hours. The transfer credit hours must be approved by the faculty mentor and the Graduate Programs Director to determine the quality and relevance of graduate courses taken elsewhe re. Significant changes in the d egree plan , as indicated on the Program of Study form, requires approval of the student's f aculty advisor and the Graduate Programs Director. Research Students who are research oriented, and may continue for a Ph.D. degree, will undertake thesis research for 6 -9 credit hours. This is the traditional option for Ph .D. students who want academic or other careers where a doctorate level degree is requir ed. Other students will expect to enter or re -enter industry, a nd they will likely choose the p roject option , or the course only option . The project represents successfully planning, conducting, and completing an individual or team task. The nature of the project may be quite varied. It could produce a research result, a product prototype in hardware or software, or a solution to a proble m in industry or academia. The p roject may also initiate a new line of inquiry or progress toward a new product or proces s. In any case, it should go beyond simply providing a learning experience; it should represent a new contribution to knowledge by the student who is working towards obtaining a Master of Science degree . Career Paths The various departments within Parks College provide a stimulating environment for graduate study. Several courses are taught by working professionals, such as from the Boeing Company. Some courses are typically offer ed in the early evenings to facilitate working engineers to enroll in the program. Class room lectures are sometimes supplemented by guest lectures, laboratory demonstrations and field trips, as appropriate. Students are encouraged to publish the results o f their thesis or project work in appropriate professional conferences and archival journals. Doctor of Philosophy Required Courses The College offers a Ph.D. degree in engineering and a Ph.D. degree in aviation . The doctoral degree program builds upon the Master of Science degree curriculum with additional course work focused on the research area of interest. The engineering Ph.D. degree requires a total of 60 cred it hours of course work and research activity beyond the Bachelor of Science degree , including 15 -18 credit hours of dissertation research . Of the 60 credit hours, a maximum of nine credit hours may be comprised of course work at the 400 level; all other course work must be at the 500 or 600 level. The a viation Ph.D. degree requires a tota l of 63 credit hours beyond the Bachelor of Science degree , including 12 credit hours of dissertation research, 15 credit hours in research methods, 9 credit hours in a secondary discipline, and 3 credit hours in graduate reading. Those students who earn a Master of Science degree may include the Master of Science degree course credits, but not the thesis or project credits in the 60 or 63 credit hours which are required for the Ph.D. degree. Additional Requirements Doctoral students are evaluated in three formal examinations. At the end of the first year of full -time doctoral study at SLU, the Qualifying Exam ination will assess the background of the student. After the second year, a dissertation proposal w ill be the basis of the Prop osal Examination, which focuses on dissertation research , but also allows faculty to assess the student's abilities in research and the student's academic strengths and weaknesses. The third examination is a Dissertation Defense . Some students will enter doctoral studies with research experience and with a Master of Science degree , and the estimated timing of these three exams will be part of the initial Program of Study . The timing may be modified with approval of the faculty ad visor, and the Director of Graduate Programs. The Qualifying Examination will focus on topics related to the required courses and the student's general preparation for graduate study and research. All qualifying examinations will be arranged and administer ed by the associated department chair . The Qualifying Exam will normally be a written examination. The intent of this exam is to determine if the student is prepared to continue doctoral studies. The result of the exam may be a pass, no -pass, or conditiona l-pass. The associated department chair will report the results of the Qualifying Exam ination to the Graduate Program s Director. The conditional -pass will normally require that the student correct specific weaknesses, and modify the Program of Study accord ingly. Revised 11/16/11 97 A doctoral student will ordinarily develop a dissertation proposal under the supervision of the faculty advis or, and present at the Proposal Exam prior to the third year of studies. The guidance c ommittee administers the dissertation proposal exam. The results are reported to the Graduate Program Director. On successfully completing the Proposal Exam, the student becomes a doctoral candidate. Upon completion of the final dissertation document, a final public defense is held as a Dissertation Defense. Following the open forum seminar -style presentation, the student continues the defense in a private session with the guidance c ommittee. Normally, graduate students are expected to publish the results of their research with their faculty advisor. Although not a rigid requirement, Ph.D. degree candidates are expected to produce a minimum of one manuscript submitted for journal publication prior to completing their degree. Every student entering the graduate program is assigned a faculty advisor. The studen t must file a proposed Program of Study normally prior to the end of the second semester of full - time doctoral study at SLU. The student's Program of Study is a schedule of academic and research work that has been carefully designed by the student in close consultation with the faculty advisor. In regard to transfer credit hours for the Ph.D. degree, up to 30 credit hours may be transferred at the Master of Science degree level to contribute to the credit hour requirements for a Ph.D. level degree. At the post-Master of Science degree level, up to 9 credit hours may be transferred to contribute to the credit hour requirements for a Ph.D. level degree. In all three cases, the transferred credit hours and associated course work are reported on the Program of Study form, and are subject to approval by the faculty advisor, department chair, and Director of Graduate Programs.

JD/PHD CURRICULUM Students begin their dua l degree studies at the School of Law as traditional first -year students. In their second and third years of study, students are primarily law students but take six hours of courses at the Center for Health Care Ethics. In addition to the six hours at the CHCE, students enroll in a three -hour directed research course that is cross -listed by both programs. The directed research project is supervised by faculty from both programs and is treated as a traditional law school directed research project. Dual deg ree students ordinarily graduate with the JD in three years of full -time study. It is recommended that they sit the bar exam in the summer following their graduation. Beginning in the fall following their graduation from the School of Law, all academic w ork is dedicated to the PhD program. The PhD program recognizes 9 hours of law school courses towards the PhD. (See details below.) Additionally, students will have completed 9 hours of Health Care Ethics classes during the JD program. Thus it is expected that students will complete their PhD coursework in two semesters following their JD program. Comprehensive exams and the dissertation ordinarily require an additional three semesters. During the entire time that students are enrolled in the dual degree program, it is expected that they will be engaged in both programs. Starting with their second year of law school, students will take part in PhD seminars and other extracurricular programs offered by the doctoral program. Once they have completed their JD and are enrolled in the doctoral program, it is expected that they will remain engaged in relevant health law activities at the School of Law. CURRICULAR DETAIL Students complete the usual curriculum in both the Juris Doctor (JD) and PhD programs.

COURSE DESCRIPTIONS Please refer to the CHCE website for course descriptions: http://bioethics.slu.edu/PhD_Course_Descriptions.html Curriculum: Certificate of Empirical Research Methods CERTIFICATE OF EMPIRICAL RESEARCH METHODS IN BIOETHICS PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND GUIDELINES PROGRAM OVERVIEW Students enrolled in the PhD Program in Health Care Ethics may opt to complete a Certificate of Empirical Research Meth ods in Bioethics. The PhD Program was designed to produce graduates who are competent in normative health care ethics. Completion of a Certificate is meant to indicate special research competencies over and above those gained in the PhD program. These specific competencies pertain to empiri cal research in the field of bioethics. The Certificate Program has two tracks: Q uantitative and Qualitative. Both tracks require the completion of 15 hours of coursework. Integration of Certificate and PhD Coursework. Some Certifi cate courses will satisfy PhD Program course requirements. These substitutions were carefully considered so as not to com promise competency in normative ethics or in knowledge of the context of health care. Because there may be up to 6 credit hours of overlap, students who enter the PhD Program with the pre -requisite in inferential statistics will be requir ed to complete only 9 additional credit hours of coursework. Students may re ceive up to 6 hours of advanced standing within the Certificate program for methods courses completed elsewhere. Integration with the PhD Program's Educational Mission. The most significant aspect of any PhD program is dissertation research. All dissertations in the PhD Program are expected to make original contributions to normative ethics in health care. However, normative ethics must be informed by many facts, frequently by emp irical facts about the values people hold, the causal factors influencing a moral situation, or the outcomes of quality improvement or educational interventions. This presents the opportunity to incorporate original empirical research into dissertations i n normative ethics. The capstone course for the Certificate, HCE652 Directed Empirical Research in Bioethics, requires students to gather original data that will be incorporated into the doctoral dis - sertation. The course will provide students with the me ntoring necessary to integrate this data into the doctoral dissertation proposal in a way that is sensitive to the interdisciplinary nature of this endeavor. COURSE OF STUDIES FOR THE QUALITATIVE TRACK Note: In square brackets substituted CHCE PhD course s are indicated. Revised 11/16/11 112 SOC -560 Research Methodology (or equivalent, such as SW-S775, Social Work Research).

SOC -580 Survey Research Methods [Topics and Scholars Elective] PSY -625 Analysis of Variance and Experimental Design PSY -650 Multivariate Statistical Analysis HCE -652 Directed Empirical Research in Bioethics [Topics requirement] As most courses build upon each other, course work is ordinarily to be completed in the order indicated above. ADVANCED STANDING AND RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS Courses in research methods may not be transferred. How ever, students who have completed graduate level courses in research methods may apply for advanced standing in the certificate program (effectively having some requirements waived in lie u of previous coursework). The student will be required to provide the CHCE Certificate Program Director with a copy of his or her transcripts and a copy of the syllabus of all courses for which recognition is sought. If the Certificate Program Director co nsiders the student to have met some of the certificate course requirements, the student will then petition the Center Director for advanced standing. At a minimum, students must complete at Saint Louis University HCE -652 plus two other 3 -credit hour grad uate level courses in research methods. Substitutions may be made in order to avoid duplication of coursework. UPON SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF CERTIFICATE COURSEWORK Certificates will be awarded upon successful completion of all coursework. Students' trans cripts will indicate the Certificate courses completed. The Center for Health Care Ethics will issue the physical Certificate, which will indicate which of the two Tracks was completed. The Certificate will be signed by the Certificate Director and the Cen ter Director. DISSERTATIONS INCORPORATING ORIGINAL EMPIRICAL RESEARCH (See policy under section on dissertations .)

Burroughs, Ph.D. Graduate Program Co -Directors Due to increased market demand for highly trained public health professionals, the School of Public Health offers a comprehe nsive doctoral program. The doctoral program allows students to study and work side -by-side with nationally known educators and researchers who serve as mentors. Recent graduates have taken positions as faculty members, with federal agencies, and within th e private health care sector. The Doctoral Program in Public Health Studies at Saint Louis University School of Public Health allows you to choose from several different public health majors: Behavioral Science and Health Education; Biosecurity and Disas ter Preparedness; Biostatistics: Environmental and Occupational Health; Epidemiology; Health Policy, and Health Services Research. Program Objectives The objectives for the doctoral studies program in the SPH are: To select, prepare and graduate individu als for public health research, education and practice in academic, private and public research, and consulting organizations. To provide students with expert skills in research design, methods and dissemination, a solid understanding of public health scie nce, including the distribution and determinants of health and disease across populations, and expertise in one of the following fields of study: behavioral science, biosecurity and disaster preparedness, biostatistics, environmental and occupational healt h, epidemiology, health management and policy (management and policy tracks), and health services research. To train future public health researchers in an apprenticeship model, in which students are matched on admission with mentor(s) in their chosen fie lds of study who have an active research agenda. Learning Objectives There are two sets of learning objectives for doctoral studies in the SPH. The first set focuses on the \"core\" knowledge, skills and abilities that are expected of all individuals rece iving the PhD degree. This set of knowledge, skills and abilities includes both the multidisciplinary, scientific fields that inform public health research and the research design, methods and dissemination techniques that facilitate scholarly contribution to one of these public health fields of study. The second set of learning objectives is concentration - specific. Each doctoral student is expected to demonstrate in -depth knowledge and expert skills and abilities in their chosen concentration. These conce ntrations include behavioral science, biosecurity and disaster preparedness, biostatistics, environmental and occupational health, epidemiology, health management and policy (management and policy tracks), and health services research. The specific knowle dge and skills provided within the doctoral program are based on a set of core and concentration specific competencies. These competencies reflect the expectations of accrediting bodies as well as the faculty. There are three components to the doctoral stu dies curriculum. The first is the core doctoral curriculum, shared across all concentrations, comprised of a total of 12 credit hours. These are divided between four shared courses. In addition, there is a required professional development course required that provides students with the opportunity to build their unique professional skills outside of formal coursework or research with their mentor (e.g., obtaining a teaching certificate or learning a new methodology). These courses are required of all students. The second is the concentration curriculum, comprised of courses totaling 48 credit hours. Within the concentration some of these credits may be for specific required courses and some may be for courses that are tailored for each student to provid e them with the knowledge and skills needed to achieve their research and professional goals. The Doctoral Program Committee will be consulted on curricula decisions for student careers, and will provide guidance and direction to the Director(s). The thi rd component consists of the dissertation, including 12 dissertation credit hours.
