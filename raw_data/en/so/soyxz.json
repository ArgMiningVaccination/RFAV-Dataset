The department emphasizes an ecological approach to health and attempts to provide students with the necessary tools to understand factors contributing to the promotion of general health and well-being, disease prevention, and the elimination of health disparities. The Department of Health Science and Human Ecology offers the following Bachelor of Science degrees: Environmental Health Science, Health Services Administration, Public Health, and Nutrition and Food Sciences. In addition, the department offers a Master of Science in Health Services Administration, and a Master of Public Health. The department also offers certificates in several specialized areas. A Bachelor of Science is appropriate for students interested in becoming health professionals, such as health educators, health administrators, or those desiring to work in environmental protection agencies, private businesses, industrial hygiene, and safety. The programs are also designed to provide a career ladder opportunity for persons currently engaged in public health, health services, and environmental occupations or preparing for graduate work in medicine, public health, allied health, and social or natural sciences. Specifically, the Bachelor of Science in Nutritional Sciences and Dietetics is appropriate for students preparing for careers dealing with foods, nutrition, or dietetics. After graduation, students are eligible to apply and complete an ACEND accredited internship/supervised-practice programs. After completion of 1,200 hours of supervised-practice, they are eligible to take the registration to become a registered dietitian/nutritionist (RDN). Also, graduates with Verification Statement may take the exam for Diet Technician Registered (DTR) to become Nutrition and Dietetic Technician Registered (NDTR). Graduates may also work as Certified Dietary Manager (CDM), dietary aides, School Nutrition Specialists (SNS), and in many other food- and nutrition-related jobs. The department offers a blend of traditional and modern approaches to education and career development in the health science field. It encourages multidisciplinary orientation, community interaction, and a social outlook, and provides appropriate instruction in the health-related areas of science. In their senior year, students intern in community agencies such as health departments, hospitals, industrial plants, environmental improvement agencies, and consumer affairs offices. This high-impact practice prepares students for a successful career by , thus combining theory and practice in a professional setting. - - Audiometrist Certification - - Offered through the College of Extended Learning, [HSCI 3374](/search/?P=HSCI%203374)leads to a certificate of registration as a school audiometrist issued by the California State Department of Health Services.
