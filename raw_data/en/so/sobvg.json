It is one of the oldest and most comprehensive systems of wellness because of its synergistic relationship with nature, the seasons, and the cosmic elements that exist in all living beings. Ayurveda emerged in India over 5000 years ago and is considered the mother of all healing, even influencing Tibetan and Chinese medicinal systems. This ancient system of healing is based on the 5 elements: Space, Air, Fire, Water, and Earth. The Five Elements explain why substances of the natural world are harmonious with the human body. We easily utilize plants, herbs, minerals, and water, because these substances are the same in composition and character to our own underlying make-up.
