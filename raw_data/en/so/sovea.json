AkdisSECTION I TOWARDS A COMPREHENSIVE GLOBAL STRATEGY FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS ContentsGLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS XVPREFACE The World Health Organization declares chronic respiratory diseases as one of the 4 major health problems of mankind. Allergic rhinitis (AR) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) affect more than 30% of the population worldwide. The socio-economic impact of chronic upper airway diseases is estimat - ed in Europe with more than 150 billion Euro per year. Unmet needs in the field of AR and CR S can be identified in several domains: education, research, development and clinical care. In addition, the huge socioeconomic burden of AR and CRS to health care systems is expected to substantially increase in the future, warranting new policies in healthcare at the global and national level. To tackle the huge global health problem of chronic upper airways inflammation, the EAACI de - cided to develop the \"Global Atlas of Allergic Rhinitis and Chronic Rhinosinusitis\" as a follow up of the \"Global Atlas of Allergy\" and \"Global Atlas of Asthma\" which were launched in 2013 and 2014, had a huge success worldwide, and are currently translated into several languages. With this Atlas, EAACI and the authors of the Atlas aim to increase awareness on the global epidemic and the burden of chronic inflammatory upper airways diseases and to bring to the global attention the need to be recognized as a main concern in national health strategies; to reinforce the role of early diagnosis and treatment, education and prevention in a structured management strategy; to reveal their priority for research; to provide guidance on how to overcome barriers; t o expand the existing programs and tools and explore innovative solutions for a comprehensive global manage - ment approach. The EAACI Global Atlas of Allergic Rhinitis and Chronic Rhinosinusitis contains 154 chapters writ - ten by 218 authors with 269 illustrations and 92 tables. It is developed as a desktop reference for multisectoral usage covering all aspects of AR and CRS from epidemiology, risk factors and molec - ular and cellular mechanisms to their management, clinical features and co-morbidities, diagnosis, treatment, prevention and control. In addition, the Atlas will offer an educational tool and a desk - top reference for medical students, allied health workers, primary care physicians, pharmacists, medical industry, policy makers, patient organizations and specialists dealing with AR and CRS. We would like to thank all of the authors for their contributions. Cezmi A. Akdis Peter W.

The allergic immune cascade in the nasal mucosa may give rise to the following symptoms in a var - iable degree of severity and du - ration: nasal congestion/obstruc - tion, rhinorrhoea, itchy nose and/ or eyes, and/or sneezing. General symptoms like fatigue, impaired concentration and reduced pro - ductivity are all associated with allergic rhinitis. The following criteria are utilized to define rhinitis: the presence of 2 or more nasal symptoms for more than 1 h per day. The discrimina - tion between mucosal and ana - tomic problems giving rise to nasal symptoms is a clinical judgement based on a proper clinical exami - nation of the nose and endonasal cavity (Figure 1). A history with 2 nasal symptoms suggestive of AR, with confirmation of nasal inflam - mation by clinical examination and diagnostic tests showing sensiti - zation to inhalant allergens, is the cornerstone of the diagnosis. The new nomenclature on clas - sification of hypersensitivity / allergic diseases for ICD-11 by Peter W. Hellings University Hospital Leuven BelgiumWHAT IS ALLERGIC RHINITIS 1 KEY MESSAGES crowd-sourcing the allergists community, is currently proposing specific definitions for subtypes of rhinitis. Based on history and clin - ical examination supplemented by diagnostic tests, rhinitis patients are classically divided into differ - ent mixed rhinitis (Figure 1). In a recent TF of the ENT section of EAACI, different rhinitis subtypes are being distin - guished (Figure 1). The allergic immune response in - volves a nasal as well as systemic immune response. The systemic nature of the allergic immune re - sponse with increased levels of IgE, IL-5 and blood eosinophilia has been recognized for several decades. In addition to nasal symp - toms, inhalation of airborne aller - gens may give rise to conjunctival symptoms like itchy eyes, tearing, congestion of the conjunctival vessels, chemosis and periorbital oedema. Allergic rhinitis may be a predisposing factor to develop disease in adjacent organs like the paranasal sinus cavities, middle ear, nasopharynx and larynx. In view of the consideration of aller - gic rhinitis and asthma being part of the airway allergy syndrome, we have nowadays good insight into the epidemiologic association between AR and AA, diagnostic requirements for considering the problem of upper or lower airways as one entity, and therapeutic im - plications for optimal treatment of 3GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION A - Allergic rhinitis - mechanisms What is allergic rhinitisAR and AA. Of note, AR is a major risk factor for asthma. Treatment of AR can be divided into medical treatment aiming at reducing inflammation with im - provement of the quality of life, and immunotherapy aiming at in - ducing tolerance (Figure 2). Suc - cessful immunotherapy for Th2 mediated allergic conditions is associated with the induction of IL-10 and TGF- producing regu - latory T (Tr)-1 cells. The majority of AR patients are well controlled with guide - line-based treatment, but up to 20% of AR patients may experi - ence bothersome symptoms de - spite adequate first-line and sec - ond-line treatment (Figure 3). The challenge of AR care in the future will be to optimize care pathways leading to a higher level of symp - tom control and prevent the pro - gression towards asthma.

The data so far is at the level of co-expressions, asso - ciations and correlations. Direct evidence for human in vivo rele - vance has not been demonstrat - ed for many of the below listed findings. Animal models still need to be improved and may not fully represent the human in vivo situ - ation. The most decisive data on mechanisms of AR reflecting hu - man in vivo situation are obtained from therapeutic response to al - lergen immunotherapy, anti-his - tamines, corticosteroids as well such as anti-IgE and anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibodies. IgE SENSITIZATION After allergen exposure through mucosa and skin, allergens are taken up by antigen-presenting cells, processed to T cell epitope peptides and presented to helper T lymphocytes by MHC-class-II molecules (Figure 1).

This leads to T cell sensitization and memory devel - opment. Activated CD4+ T helper 2 lymphocytes release cytokines, mainly IL-4 and IL-13 and interact with B lymphocytes to induce the class-switch and synthesis of aller - gen-specific IgE (IgE sensitization) and development of IgE B cell memory and IgE-secreting plasma cells. Allergen-specific IgE binds to the high affinity receptor for IgE (Fc RI) on the surface of mast cells. The presence of circulating IgE towards a specific allergen is not fully linked to a clinically sig - nificant AR, and levels of total IgE rarely provide information about IgE to specific allergens. EARLY PHASE (IMMEDIATE) RESPONSE The early or immediate phase re - sponse occurs in IgE-sensitized individuals within minutes of ex - posure to the allergen and lasts for about 2-4 hours. Mast cell de - granulation is a cardinal compo - nent of the early phase response. Mast cells are abundant in the ep - ithelial compartment of the nasal The underlying mechanisms in allergic rhinitis6GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION A - Allergic rhinitis - mechanisms mucosa and can be easily activat - ed upon re-exposure to the aller - gens. Upon allergen cross-linking of specific IgE bound to the sur - face high affinity receptors (Fc RI) of mast cells degranulate and release a variety of pre-formed and newly synthesized mediators leading to the early phase re - sponse. Mast cell secretory gran - ules contain preformed mediators that are rapidly (within seconds to minutes) released into the extra - cellular environment. These me - diators include cell-mediated allergic reactions, including edema, in -creased vascular permeability and nasal discharge in AR. Histamine, the major mediator of AR, stimu - lates the sensory nerve endings of the trigeminal nerve and induces sneezing and pruritus. Histamine also stimulates secretion of mucous and histamine, leukotrienes and pros - taglandins act on the blood ves - sels causing nasal congestion. LATE PHASE RESPONSE 4-6 hours after allergen stimula - tion, the early phase response is usually followed by the late phase response. The late phase response lasts for about 18-24 hours and is characterized by influx of T lym - phocytes, basophils and these leukotrienes, kinins, histamine, chemokines and cy - tokines, which result in the con - tinuation of the symptoms. The production and release of a vari - ety of cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-9 and IL-13 from mast cells, ILC, basophils and Th2 cells play a role in the orchestration and continu - ation of the late phase response. IL-4 and IL-13 can upregulate the expression of vascular cell adhe - sion molecule 1 on endothelial cells facilitating the infiltration of the nasal mucosa with eosinophils, Th2 monocyte Figure 1 Sensitization and type I hypersensitivity reaction.

The underlying mechanisms in allergic rhinitis7GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION A - Allergic rhinitis - mechanisms thymus-and activation regu - lated chemokine (TARC) released from epithelial cells serve as che - moattractants for eosinophils, basophils and macrophage factor (GM-CSF), released largely by epithelial cells, and IL-5 from type 2 ILC and Th2 lymphocytes prolong the survival in the nasal mucosa of the infiltrating eosin - ophils. Other mediators released from the eosinophils such as the eosinophil cationic protein, plate - let-activating factor, major basic protein have additional roles in the late phase response. The late phase response is characterized by a prolongation of symptoms - sneezing, rhinorrhea, but most predominant by a sustained nasal congestion. AR also triggers a sys - temic inflammation besides local inflammation, which can in turn augment inflammation in both the upper and lower airways and ex - plains the link to asthma.STRUCTURAL TISSUE CELLS IN ALLERGIC RHINITIS Epithelial cells in AR have a wide range of immunomodulatory ac - tivities through the release of (SCF)) and thus contributing to the enhancement of allergic inflammation. Further - more, nasal epithelial cells in AR release matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9 and MMP-13, Figure 1 Type 2 inflammation and cytokine network in the AR nose. AR inflammation develops as a combination of innate and adaptive immune response and involvement of resident tissue cells. Epithelial activation and cytokine release (TSLP, IL-25, IL-31, IL-33) leads to type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) activation. IL-4 from mast cells and ILC2s augments the Th2 response. TSLP-induced OX-40-ligand from DC induces a Th2 response. IL-4 and IL-13 lead to B cell activation and local IgE production. IL-5 from Th2 cells and ILC2 promotes tissue eosinophilia. IL-4 and IL-13 activate the endothelium for tissue migration eosinophils, and mast cells activate the epithelium. The underlying mechanisms in allergic rhinitis8GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION A - Allergic rhinitis - mechanisms which can cleave almost all secret - ed and cell surface molecules as well as extracellular matrix. Nasal epithelial cells express HLA-DR and CD86 and can present antigen to T cells. Epithelial cell-derived thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), IL- 25 and IL-33 are essential factors in AR. Increased IL-25 can amplify the ongoing allergic inflammation, particularly by augmenting the Th2 type inflammation. IL-33 can am - and the IL-5, IL-9 and IL-13 secreting type 2 ILC activation. All three cytokines can directly and indirectly enhance in - nate lymphoid cell-contribution to effector functions such as tissue eosinophilia and increased Th2 re - sponse (Figure 2). Epithelial barrier and tight junc - tion integrity is essential in AR as it is in asthma, chronic rhinosinus - itis (CRS) and atopic dermatitis. In all these diseases the epithelial barrier is prone to be impaired by allergens and pollutants. With its cysteine protease activity Der p 1 is able to alter the epithelial tight junctions, thereby increasing epi - thelial permeability. Due to their enzymatic proteolytic activity many allergens can directly acti - vate epithelial cells and can induce cytokine and chemokine release and thus airway inflammation in - dependent of IgE. Furthermore, in AR individuals epithelial cells are more sensitive to air pollutants like diesel exhaust particles.Endothelial cells play a role in the pathogenesis of AR by partici - pating in the recruitment of leu - kocytes to the site of the allergic response. Endothelial cell VCAM- 1 is over expressed during the pollen season. Endothelial cells in AR are also an important source of several cytokines and chemokines like RANTES and eotaxin. Moreo - ver, similar to epithelial cells, en - dothelial cells also express the H1 receptor and stimulation with his - tamine induces activation of these cells. Tissue macrophages and den - dritic cells also contribute to AR inflammation by releasing mac - rophage-derived chemokine that attracts Th2 cells. Tissue fibroblasts are also in - volved in AR. IL-4 promotes the proliferation of allergic fibroblasts, and the production of GM-CSF and SCF increases by histamine stimulation. KEY REFERENCES 1.

Recently, also mast cells (MCs) have been identi - fied as important regulators in the upper airways. MCs express TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, and TLR6, comple C5a. Upon stimulation (microbial, an - tigen, allergen, or cellular stress) more cells belonging to the innate immune system are recruited. From these cells, innate lymphoid cells will be discussed in detail chapter A6. Neutrophils represent the prototypic circulating phago - cyte, which belong to the first line defense mechanism. Another important cell type is the NK-cells exhibiting unique features. They are lymphoid cells, which do not express the classical antigen-spe - cific receptors.

Several strategies have evolved in order to fulfill this task such as secret - ed molecules (e.g. anti-microbial peptides, collectins, surfactant proteins, pentraxins), membrane bound ceptors, C-type receptors), cytosolic receptors (e.g. NOD- like receptors, RIG-I, MDA5) as well as receptors, which are both secreted or membrane-bound (prototypic examples, CD14 and LPS-binding proteins) (Table 1). These molecules are produced by a variety of resident and non-resi - dent, infiltrative cells in the upper respiratory tract including epi - thelial cells, dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, and mast cells. DCs be subdivided into classic myeloid (mDC) and plasmocytoid (pDC) types which are thought to originate from a common DC-pre - cursor in the bone marrow. mDCs form of subepithelial web, they are rich in pattern-recognition recep - tors and, therefore, sensitive to microbes, inflammation, and cel - lular stress. pDCs are particularly relevant for the anti-viral respons - es, they are expressing TLR7 and TLR9 and large amounts Harald Renz Philipps Marburg Marburg, GermanyTHE INNATE IMMUNE RESPONSE IN ALLERGIC RHINITIS 3 KEY MESSAGES The innate immune response in allergic rhinitis10GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION A - Allergic rhinitis - mechanisms The innate immune response in allergic rhinitisTABLE 1 Innate Pattern Recognition Receptors in Humans Pattern Recognition Receptors PAMP Structures Recognized Membrane Bound Toll-like cell wall lipids; viral coat proteins Pentraxins C-reactive protein Endotoxin tory response (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus ) or may prevent the develop - ment of allergic inflammation in the context of the \"hygiene hypothesis\". However, the detailed molecular signals and pathways leading either to augmentation and enhancement or to the prevention of the respons -es have not been fully elucidated yet. Certainly, further research is needed in this field. In addition to microbes, many al - lergens may directly interact with cells of the innate immune system. One prominent example is the structural and functional homol - ogy of defined allergenic compo - nents with the pattern recognition system (e.g. Der p 2 is a homolog for MD-2; Der p 7, Fel d 1, Mus m 1, and Equ c 1 are homologs for lipid-binding proteins). Further - more, many allergens exhibit pro - tease activity that is associated with their allergenicity. Examples are Der p 1, Der p 3, and Der p 9. In conclusion, the innate immune system plays a critical role in the first line interaction between the environment and the host. This in - cludes the interactions with path - ogens, immune-regulatory mi - crobes, allergens, and toxins. This first line defense mechanism plays also an important role in orches - trating the subsequent adaptive immune response leading either to tolerance or (chronic) inflam - mation. KEY REFERENCES 1.

Such a mechanism may contribute to the enhancement of MCs activation especially when the levels of an -tigen in the microenvironment are rather low and contribute to nasal hyperresponsivess. The local production of IgE in the nasal mucosa of AR patients is well established. Cytokines like IL-4, and IL-13 released from T cells help drive B cells toward IgE synthesis and can contribute to the local IgE synthesis and MCs can orchestrate ongoing allergic inflammation (Figure 2).

However, over the last 20 years studies fo - cused on nasal and bronchial MCs have clearly shown their wider involvement in ongoing inflam - mation in AR and asthma. More recent human studies implicate an important role for MCs also in other airway diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory infections and lung fibrosis. While their roles mainly include immune-modula - tory, pro-inflammatory and pro-fi - brotic activities, MCs can also downregulate inflammation and participate in the defense against respiratory infections. Human MCs were classified into two phenotypically distinct sub - populations based on the type of neutral proteases they express, namely MC (T) that contain only tryptase, and MC (TC) that con - tain chymase, cathepsin G and carboxypeptidase in addition to tryptase. In patients with AR, MC (T) are found to abundantly accu - mulate in the epithelial compart - ment of the nasal mucosa.

More recently, it has been shown that oxidative stress may upregulate the IL-4 gene expres - sion in mast MCs. MCs can also in - teract with structural cells, such as epithelial cells and activate these cells or be activated by these cells via cytokines like IL-25, IL-33 and chemokines like RANTES.There are several therapies target - ing MCs for AR. With MCs being the major producers of histamine, leukotrienes and prostaglandins (e.g. prostaglandin D2), the clini - cal efficacy of antihistamines, an - ti-leukotrienes in AR can be inter - preted as a strong indication of a significant mast cell role in AR. The pioneering drug in this context, the anti-IgE monoclonal antibody omalizumab, has been shown to reduce both inflammatory param - eters, as well as patient-related outcomes (e.g. symptom scores and quality of life) in asthmatics and in patients with AR (although omalizumab is not indicated in AR alone).

BASOPHIL PRESENCE IN NASAL MUCOSA IN ALLERGIC RHINITIS Several studies have demonstrated basophils in the nasal mucosa in allergic rhinitis (AR) patients. The research group at Johns Hopkins University under supervision of Lawrence Lichtenstein, claiming that the nose was the only organ in which you could sample with a pipette, has been pioneering in this area by thorough analysis of medi - ators and cells in nasal mucosa. In the allergen-induced late-phase re - action, a typical basophil mediator profile and cells representing baso - phils were found.

BASOPHIL PRODUCTS Basophils are supposed to play an important role via their products released. Next to histamine, baso - phils can release many pre-formed and newly mediators, such as leukotriene C4 and platelet-acti - vating factor. In addition, basophils are potent sources of cytokines and chemokines. An additional mechanism that basophils might use is the stimulation of cells via co-stimulatory molecules. CD40L on basophils will activate local B cells via binding to their CD40 and via simultaneous release of IL-4 might drive local IgE production.STIMULATION OF BASOPHILS Although it is unlikely that high levels of allergens will still be present when basophils infiltrate the nasal mucosa, there are sev - eral allergen-independent ways that activate basophils (Figure 2). Chemokines are not only im - portant to attract basophils, but also induce their degranulation in higher concentration. Locally pro - duced cytokines will stimulate ba - sophils, either on their own or in combination with other cytokines and mediators, including innate cytokines such as IL-33. Human basophils, in contrast to their murine counterpart, lack PAR2 receptors, so it is unlikely, if proteases derived from allergens can activate. On the other hand, bacterial products, such as cell wall proteins from Staphylococ- cus aureus and Peptostreptococcus magnum can activate basophils via crosslinking IgE, while formyl-me -Figure 2 Basophils activation by different type of stimuli. The most prominent activation is via allergen interacting with IgE causing crosslinking of FcRI. Bacterial products can crosslink IgE independent of its antigen specificity.

In addi - tion, AR patients have increased numbers of basophil progenitors in their blood, probably due to continuous release of basophil dif - ferentiation factors in the tissue. In conclusion, basophils and their products can be found in nasal mu - cosa of AR patients. It is tempting to believe that these cells are im - portant for the pathomechanism in this disease. However, the pres - ence of many other inflammatory cells and their products makes it a challenge to dissect the exact role of basophils in this disease. KEY REFERENCES 1.

ILC2s are enriched in nasal polyps from patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and are increased in eosinophilic com - pared with non-eosinophilic polyp endotypes. Unlike conventional T cells, ILC2s are not antigen spe - cific and are activated by sever - al mediators including cytokines TSLP and IL-33, as well as lipid mediators prostaglandin D2 and cysteinyl leukotrienes (Figure 1). Importantly, these mediators have been detected at higher levels in CRS patients and are thus availa - ble for ILC2 activation. Two studies have investigated the effects of allergen exposure on peripheral blood ILC2s in patients with allergic rhinitis (AR). In the first study, changes in peripheral Taylor A.

The percent of CRTH2+ ILC2s was increased 2-fold after cat allergen challenge compared to diluent control challenge given to the same subjects at a separate visit. The second report demon - strated that peripheral blood ILC2s were increased during grass pollen season in pollen AR patients. In - terestingly, the levels of peripher - al blood ILC2s were also reduced by subcutaneous immunotherapy. The function of peripheral blood ILC2s after allergen exposure in AR is not known, but may involve re - cruitment of ILC2s from the bone marrow that are bound for tissues. Importantly, ILC2s express CRTH2 that binds to PGD2 and is known to promote chemotaxis of immune cells including ILC2s.

The characteristic symptoms of AR are rhinorrhea (excess nasal secretion), itching, sneezing, na - sal congestion and obstruction. The immune response in AR is initiated by T cell production of Th2 cytokines, which drive IgE cross-linking on surface of mast cells resulting in release of pre- formed mediators such as his - tamine, leukotrienes and pros - taglandins (early response). This is followed by recruitment of inflammatory cells, namely eo - sinophils and CD4+ T cells to the nose resulting in nasal edema and obstruction (late phase). The key features of AR (which distinguish AR from other forms of rhinitis such as non-allergic rhinosinusitis) include allergen-specific IgE and eosinophilic inflammation. The presence of eosinophilia in the nasal mucosa of AR patients has been long established (Figure 1A). Nasal allergen provocation in AR patients leads to increase in tissue eosinophilia (Figure 1C and D), as well as expression of pro-eosinophilic cytokines such EOSINOPHILS IN ALLERGIC RHINITIS 9 KEY in allergic rhinitisas IL-5 and GM-CSF. Following allergen challenge, there is a local increase of eosinophil precursors and progenitors in the nasal tissue as well as local eosinophil differ - entiation. In seasonal AR, there is an accumulation of activated eo - sinophils during natural grass-pol - len exposure. Eosinophil counts as well as eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) in nasal secretions were re - lated to the severity of symptoms in seasonal AR and can be used for the diagnosis and management of AR. Chronic and/or untreated AR may result in complications which in - clude recurrent chronic sinusitis and formation of nasal polyps. There is a large accumulation of eosinophils and their cytokines in both of these cases. These effects can be largely attributed to IL-5 and eotaxin (Figure 2), an eosino - phil chemo-attractant, whose pro - duction is significantly increased in the nasal mucosa, although others including GM-CSF and RANTES are likely to contribute. In grass-sensitive patients, aller - gen immunotherapy effectively inhibits - fectively activated eosino - phils in seasonal AR (Figure 1B), in patients with nasal polyps or with severe chronic sinusitis. Together these data suggest that eosino - phil is a critical cell involved in the pathogenesis of AR.Meri K.

However such a reaction will develop, only under specific conditions, while the nor - mal response that is induced is im - mune tolerance to allergens. The type and amount of allergen as well as the context in which APCs come into contact with antigens is crucial for the final fate of the immunolog - ic reaction toward the antigen. A number of different cell types are capable of acting as APCs, but the most important and effective are dendritic cells (DC). Mainly, three different types of dendritic cells are present in the human na - that have differ - ent properties and ontogeny. In the human nasal mucosa, dendritic cells have first been described by Haas, and Langerhans cells by Fokkens. Recent literature has furthermore demonstrated that mDCs and pDCs are both present in the mucosa of al - lergic rhinitis (AR) patients and that their reaction after allergen contact might promote inflammation.ANTIGEN PRESENTING CELLS IN ALLERGIC RHINITIS 10 KEY MESSAGES Antigen presenting cells in allergic rhinitisDCs process the allergen into small peptides that are presented onto MHCI and MHCII to T cells. They act at the interface of innate and adaptive immunity and can set the course toward a Th2-type allergic reaction or - under differ - ent circumstances - toward Th1-, Th17-, or T regulatory reactions. Generally, antigen presentation by pDCs will lead to tolerance while engagement of mature DCs will promote allergic reactions. Impor - tant determinants for the type of immunologic reaction are the cy - tokine milieu at the site, the time of contact and the concurrent ex - posure to adjuvants, such as diesel exhaust particles or enzymatically active allergen components.Apart from their essential role in the pathogenesis of allergic re - actions, dendritic cells have also been demonstrated to be relevant in the maintenance and propaga - tion of allergic inflammation and thus in the development of clinical symptoms.

Depending on the specific microbiological threat the immune system encounters a dedicated subclass of CD4 T helper cells is induced by the interaction and ac - tivation of dendritic cells. These T helper cells in turn may induce and activate effector cells such as eosinophils or neutrophils, or may activate B cells to become plasma cells that produce pathogen specif - ic immunoglobulins. In the case of allergy, harmless en - vironmental molecules like grass or tree pollen, animal dander, or house dust mite droppings are mistaken for parasites and the immune system elicits a strong Th2 and IgE-driven response that fails to remove these \"irrelevant threats\" yet does induce the clin - ical symptoms of rhinorrhoea, nasal congestion, and itching. An - other specific class of T cells, the regulatory T cells (Tregs) is able to dampen immune responses.

In the case of Foxp3- CD25 positive Tregs that do not produce IL-10 or TGF-beta, a di - rect physical interaction with other T cells blocks the T cell receptor mediated activation.

They confer cell-to-cell communication, which may take place between adjacent cells ( jux- tacrine ) or cells in different organs body ( para- or endocrine ). A cytokine signal is delivered via a receptor on the surface of a cell, and since different cells may express the same receptor, a cy - tokine can have several functions (pleiotropy ) depending on the tar - get cell. A special subgroup of cytokines is constituted of the so-called chemokines that attract leuko - cytes to the site of inflammation, and the immune system uses these to move leukocytes in the tissues, when they have left the bloodstream. The chemokines are key players in attracting the leu - kocytes to inflamed areas such as the nose in allergic rhinitis (AR). The chemokines have a fairly sim - ilar biochemical structure, and are divided according to the place - ment of two intramolecular cys - tin-bridges (Figure 1) into groups: CC, CXC or CX3C, where X de - notes a non-cystein amino acid residue. Various groups of cytokines are responsible for the different phas - es of the allergic sensitization CYTOKINES AND CHEMOKINES IN ALLERGIC RHINITIS 12 KEY MESSAGES Cytokines and chemokines in allergic rhinitis(building up the allergic immune response) and elicitation (reac - tions upon exposure to an aller - gen): The sensing cytokines (Figure 2, yellow), IL-33, IL-25 and TSLP are released from the epithelial cells of the nasal mucosa and signal to the allergen-presenting dendritic cells to take up incoming aller - gens and bring them to the lymph nodes. The T-cell instructing cytokines (Figure 2, green) will instruct un - differentiated T-helper (CD4+) cells to develop into differ - ent kinds of cells, each of them equipped for different kinds of im - mune response: IL-12 and -inter - feron will produce type T-helper cells (Th1) that helps fighting bac - teria and virus, IL-4 leads to Th2 cells which fights large multicel - lular parasites like worms, but un - fortunately also create the allergic immune response. Other Th-cell types such as Th17 (believed to be active in fighting bacterial fungal infections, but unfortunately also involved in autoimmune diseases), and Tregulatory (dampening the inflammation) also exists. T-cell effector cytokines (Figure 2, red) are the cytokines by which T helper cells exerts their action: Th2 cells release IL-4 and IL-13, which instructs B-cells to produce the allergy antibody IgE, IL-5 that causes the bone marrow to form the eosinophilic granulocyte, and IL-9 that together with IL-13 cre - ates the allergic inflammation e.g. in the nose as is the case in allergic rhinitis.Lars K.

( Copyright Kohidai, L. ) Cytokines and chemokines in Chemokines (Figure 2, purple). When chemokines are secreted from inflammatory cells, a gradient builds up, where the highest con - centration is closest to the secret - ing cell, and in this way different leukocytes may sense instructions about direction. The movement of cells up against a gradient is called chemotaxis, and the large number of chemokines and their corre - sponding receptors, constitute an elaborate system, that can decide which inflammatory leukocytes, e.g. eosinophils, neutrophils, ba - sophils or T- and B-cell subpopu - lations are attracted to a certain site in the nasal mucosa. It is likely that the organ in which the aller - gic reaction takes place: the nose, the lungs or the skin make use of different chemokines, thus also transferring organ specificity to the inflammatory response. Some chemokines may also - at higher concentrations - activate leuko - cytes to release mediators, and in this way they become important the important directing players in the allergic reaction. The most important chemokines in the al - lergic inflammation are eotaxin-1 (CCL11), eotaxin -2 (CCL24) and eotaxin -3 (CCL26) all which act via the CCR3-receptor present on eosinophils, basophils and cer -tain T helper-cell populations. An - other, more generally acting Th2 chemokine, is RANTES (CCL5) that acts via the CCR5-receptor. KEY REFERENCES 1. Akdis M. The cellular orchestra in skin allergy; are differences to lung and tion.

Upon activation by antigen, mature cells may be further mod - ified by somatic hypermutation (SHM) during affinity maturation. Competition for antigen results in selective survival and proliferation of high affinity clones. In parallel, the cells undergo class switch re - combination (CSR) from IgM to IgG, IgA or IgE (direct switching). IgG- and IgA- expressing B cells can also switch to IgE (sequential switching) and this may be the predominant pathway for local IgE production in allergic rhinitis (AR). Sequential switching is correlated with affinity maturation in IgE. Every B cell clone expresses a unique immunoglobulin. Diver - sification of a B cell clone during an immune response generates clonally related progeny. Clones are associated with a hierarchy of mutations derived from the orig - inal immunoglobulin sequence assembled in the bone marrow. The entire population of B cells in IgE REPERTOIRES IN ALLERGIC RHINITIS 14 KEY MESSAGES an individual is termed the B cell repertoire. Until recently, analy - sis of the antibody repertoire was very labour intensive and limited to tens or hundreds of antibody sequences. This science has been revolutionized by the \"next gener - ation sequencing\" (NGS) methods in which the sequences of millions of DNA molecules can be deter - mined in parallel in a single exper - iment, approaching the complete repertoire of the B cell population in an individual.

Analysis of matched blood and nasal biopsy samples in rhinitis patients demonstrat - ed trafficking of B cells between blood and the nasal mucosa, sup - porting previous evidence that the nasal mucosa enhances the diversification of IgE-producing B cells (Figure 2). In patients with AR, IgE repertoires have greater inter- and intra-clonal diversity and increased SHM com - pared to IgE from healthy controls (Figure 3). The level of SHM with - in the 'allergic' IgE repertoire was strongly influenced by seasonal exposure to allergen, particular - ly in local nasal tissue compared to the blood (Figure 4).

In the bone marrow, B cells acquire recombinatorial diversity by random shuffling of VDJ segments for the IgM ( \u00b5) heavy chain (VH), and lambda- (Vk) light-chains. Junctional diversity is simultaneously introduced by addition or deletion of nucleotides at breaks in the DNA before end-joining. Antigen exposure may induce SHM and CSR to IgE during affinity maturation of B cells in the germinal center of peripheral lymphoid tissue. In allergic patients, the production of IgE contributes to the allergic response by sensitising IgE effector cells and antigen-presenting cells for antigen-induced activation. Selection checkpoints are imposed to regulate clonal expansion and affinity maturation of B cells. Figure 2 Formation of IgE lineage trees.

Mature miR is incorporated into the RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC) and regulates gene expression by base pairing of the seed sequence to the 3'-UTR of target mRNA (Figure 1). Depending on the level of complementarity be - tween miR and its target site, target mRNA degradation, translational repression, or both occur. miRNAs are involved in diverse bi - ologic processes including allergic responses.

As with other types of inflammatory re - sponses, the local accumulation of different subgroups of leukocytes occurs during the initiation and maintenance phases, whereas in - flammatory cell numbers decline in the resolution phase of allergic inflammation. The changes in cell numbers during inflammation are largely due to changes in rates, both of cell recruitment and of cell death. Important leukocyte subgroups believed to play criti - cal roles in the pathophysiology of AR are the dendritic cells, T cells, mast cells, and eosinophils. The contribution of cell death to the pathogenesis of allergic dis - eases has recently been summa - rized elsewhere. Although most of the reports published so far have not been studies with AR patients or animal models, one could expect that these findings should have relevance for AR. For instance, it is likely that epi - thelial cell damage accompanies the allergic inflammation of the nasal mucosa. Moreover, the sus - ceptibility of T cells for undergo -REGULATION OF INFLAMMATION BY CELL DEATH IN ALLERGIC RHINITIS 16 KEY MESSAGES ing apoptosis might be regulated similarly to other inflammatory responses. The mode of cell death in eosino - phils has been the subject of most studies on cell death regulation and inflammation in AR. Eosino - phils accumulate in the nasal mu - cosa not only owing to increased recruitment, but also as a conse - quence of delayed apoptosis. The major eosinophil survival factor seems to be IL-5. Interestingly, allergen-specific immunotherapy reduced IL-5 production by CD4+ T cells in AR patients and anti-IL-5 antibody therapy has been effec - tive in patients with nasal polypo - sis. The beneficial effect of topical corticosteroid therapy in AR is probably also largely a conse - quence of the reduced expression of Th2 delayed eosinophil ap -optosis, and cytolysis, which represents a form of non-apoptotic cell death, have also been observed in AR. It has been suggested that eosino - phil cytolysis occurs without prior extensive degranulation and is the result of major activation mecha - nisms distinct from degranulation. The molecular mechanisms of eo - sinophil activation resulting in cy - tolysis remain to be investigated. A look at the molecular basis of many allergic diseases reveals a cell death component that either accounts for the disease or con - tributes to disease progression. For instance, following eosinophil activation in AR, signaling path - ways mediating both cell survival and cell death are activated.

The activation of eosinophils can change their cellular life span. Either eosinophils exhibit a prolonged life span owing to cytokine-mediated delayed apoptosis or they undergo cytolysis. With delayed apoptosis, eosinophils contribute to the maintenance of inflammation by multiple mechanisms. Cytolysis, on the other hand, is associated with massive granule protein secretion. Moreover, cytolysis most likely results in the release of damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs), which are known to trigger inflammatory responses. The release of DAMPs from cytolytic eosinophils remains to be further studied; hence, this pathway is indicated with dashed arrows. anti-allergic therapies should also be analyzed with respect to their impact on cell death pathways.

The principle for AIT is to in - duce immune tolerance to an aller - gen through high-dose exposure for prolonged periods of time. The mechanisms that underlie allergen tolerance include chang - es in dendritic cells (DCs), aller - gen-specific B- and T- cells, and reduced activation of effector cells such as basophils, mast cells and eosinophils. This results in suppression of both immediate and late phase responses trig - gered by allergen exposure. Already within hours after the first injection of the allergenic extract used for AIT the level of mast cell and basophil degranulation in re - sponse to allergen exposure is re - duced. This effect may be attrib - uted to the gradual inhibition of degranulation that may take place during the buildup phase of AIT and to changes in histamine re - ceptor 2 expression on basophils.

It is therefore a prerequisite to maintain an intact and functioning epithelium in order to keep the submucosal equilibrium balanced and not to promote inflammation. The epithelial barrier in the nose and paranasal sinuses consists of a pseudostratified, ciliated, epi - thelium that is held together by structures like tight junctions, desmosomes, adherens junctions and gap junctions. Furthermore, barrier function is promoted by proteins that have antimicrobi - al properties such as defensins, cathelicidins, lysozyme and lacto - ferrin, as well as others. The S-100 protein family contributes to these antimicrobial effects, while influencing innate immunity and Toll-like receptors (Figure 1). One of the main contributors to the barrier function is the tight junctional belt. Tight junctions are formed by the integral membrane proteins Claudins, Occludin, lipol - ysis-stimulated lipoprotein recep - tor (LSR) and junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs,) and by many peripheral membrane proteins, including the scaffold PSD95-Dlg-THE EPITHELIAL BARRIER IN THE NOSE 19 KEY MESSAGES The epithelial barrier in the noseTakashi Kojima Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, JapanMichael B.

These tight junctions are controlled by various cytokines and growth fac - tors via distinct signal transduc - tion pathways. The tight junction molecules are expressed in both membranous or microfold cells (M cells) and dendritic cells (DCs) as well as by the epithelial cells of upper airways (Figure 2). Various antigens are sampled, transport - ed, and released to lymphocytes through the cells in nasal mucosa, while they maintain the integrity of the barrier. Expression of tight junction molecules and the barri - er function in normal human na - sal epithelial cells (HNECs) are af -fected by various stimuli including growth factors, TLR ligands and cytokines etc (Table 1). In addition, epithelial-derived thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) which is a key factor for allergic inflammato - ry diseases including allergic rhini - tis (AR), enhances the barrier func - tion together with an increase of tight junction molecules in HNECs and DCs (Figure 3).

In order to quantify the changes induced by provocation inside the nasal cavity various methods can be used, ranging from nasal symptoms scores to rhinomanometry, peak flowmetry, and acoustic rhinometry. Howev - er, there is still no widely accepted single provocation method or di - agnostic standard. CDA provocation has been proven to be superior to histamine provo - cation in clinical settings and cor - relates well the provocation tests using histamine or methacholine. The machinery for creating CDA could be simply made using a re - frigerator, a pressure regulator, and a mist separator (Figure 1). By performing acoustic rhinometry before and after the provocation, changes in the volume and dimen - sions of the nasal cavity induced by CDA can be measured. and are reliable diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of nasal hyperreactivity.Young Hyo Kim Tae Young Jang Inha University College of Medicine Incheon, Republic of Korea58GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION A - Allergic rhinitis - mechanisms CONCLUSION Nasal hyperreactivity is a very common phenomenon among pa - tients with allergic or non-allergic rhinitis. Although it significant - ly impairs their quality of life, we know very little about its mech - anism and there are no standard diagnostic criteria or therapeutic strategies. Therefore, more stud - ies are needed to better under - stand this phenomenon. KEY REFERENCES 1. Gerth van Wijk RG, de Graaf-in YS, Kim KJ, TY.

These animal models are important to examine the mechanism of the disease and define the pathogenic pathways, such as the activity of genes and cellular pathways, explore the role of environmental factors (such as the microbiota), suggest new ther - apeutic options and predict the safety of new drugs or chemicals before being used in clinical stud - ies, The ideal animal model should reflect the disease pathophysiolo - gy as closely as possible and new models are essential for the devel - opment of new therapies. Laboratory mice do not spontane - ously develop AR and a range of sensitization and challenge pro - tocols have been developed. The number of sensitizations and chal - lenges can vary, but typically ani - mals are sensitized to the allergen via intraperitoneal intranasal allergen chal - lenge. Disease severity measures include sneezing frequency, nose rubbing motion frequency and na - sal tissue histology. Nasal lavage fluid and nasal tissue are utilized ANIMAL MODELS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS 22 KEY MESSAGES Animal models of allergic rhinitisto determine local cytokine levels and analyze the type of inflam - matory infiltrate and lymphocyte polarization. AR can be influenced by the genetic background of the mice, the allergen, type of the sen - sitization and challenge protocol and contamination of the allergen with stimulating substances (e.g. LPS). Certain protocols require the combination of allergen with an adjuvant, for example alumin - ium hydroxide (ALOH3, Alum). Of note, the dosage form of Alum adjuvant is decisive. The inclusion of Staphylococcus aureus entero - toxin B is thought to support the formation of nasal polypoid le - sions. The sensitization, challenge and analysis parameters of murine allergy models are summarized in Figure 1. Although murine models of AR provide important insights into the disease mechanisms, there are some limitations that should be considered. In addition to the genetic and physiological differ - ences between humans and mice, rats or rabbits, there are also lim - itations due to complexity of this disease. One can replicate impor - tant components of the disease, but no single model accurately models all the features of AR. This is very important to take into ac - count when choosing the correct model to address the specific ex - perimental question. For example, chronic exposure to the allergen may be required to examine many of the structural changes associ - ated with AR. Notwithstanding the limitations of these models, several studies carried out in an - imal models have given important clues that explain the pathophys - iological conditions related to the disease status.

FACTORS INFLUENCING THE PREVALENCE OF AR The prevalence of seasonal AR is higher in children and adoles - cents, while perennial AR seems to be more common in adults. In children, boys outnumber girls in terms of prevalence but tendency reverses in puberty and by adult - hood, both sexes are being equally affected.

PREVALENCE OF AR IN CHILDREN The International Study of Asth - ma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) program phases I, II and III held in more than 237 centers in 98 countries worldwide using standardized methodology, have demonstrated major worldwide variations for AR prevalence in children, with the lowest preva - lence being observed mainly in centers from middle/low income countries, particularly in Africa/ Latin America. ISAAC phase III repeated the same questionnaire to assess the time trends 5-10 years after the initial phase I, and showed that the prevalence of AR is increasing in most of the areas with a few exceptions.

Cross-sectional studies across the globe, using standard - ized questionnaires, shows sub - stantial average global prevalence of rhinitis, which increases from childhood (8.5% at 6-7 years) to 14.6% at 13-14 years. Keil et al, recently showed that prevalence of AR quadrupled from 6% at 3-years to 24% at 13-years in chil - dren with non-allergic parents and tripled from 13% to 44% for chil - dren with at least one allergic par - ent.. In the Isle of Wight Birth Co - hort rhinitis prevalence increased 7-fold from 5.4% at 4-years to 35.8% at 18-years. This rise was seen in children of both allergic and non-allergic parents. There is very little information available re - garding the course of AR through adult life. However, clinical expe - rience and a few studies that have been done suggest that it takes a chronic course with significant re - mission and relapse. The classical \"atopic march\" por - trays a characteristic evolution of allergic disease from one state to another through childhood, which typically suggested that rhinitis NATURAL HISTORY OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS 2 KEY MESSAGES follows asthma, mostly appearing in later childhood or adolescence. However, it is likely that in reality, allergic diseases, especially asth - ma and rhinitis, exist together due to common underlying immune and epithelial dysregulation lead - ing to airway inflammation and giving rise to the \"one airway one disease\" concept. Atopy, as defined by positive skin test or presence of specific IgE, significantly influences the natu - ral course of the disease. Rhinitis is conventionally regarded as an allergic disorder but similar con - stellation of symptoms can oc - cur without evidence of allergic sensitization in the non-allergic rhinitis. There is a male prepon - derance in AR during childhood, which persists up to young adult life. Non-allergic rhinitis behaves differently. It is often transient during early childhood. It then in - creases in prevalence during later childhood with no clear sex dom - inance but acquired a female pre - dominance by the age of 18-years as girls \"grew into\" it while boys \"grew out of\" rhinitis during ado - lescence. The different dynamic for allergic and non-allergic rhinitis in males and females is illustrated in Figures 1and 2. Similar gender switch during adolescence is seen in non-allergic asthma which is more common in boys but women acquire more non-allergic asthma during adolescence.

Thus they appear to be comparable in an acceptable way. In the Multicentre Allergy Study MAS-90 ARIA criteria were used to define rhinitis in children and young adults. Symptoms were defined as \"severe\" (impairment of daily activities) or \"mild\" (no impairment), \"persistent\" (dura - tion >1 month) or ques - tionnaires.

According to the ARIA criteria, the impact of AR seems to be substantial; the vast majority of affected children suf - fered persistently for periods of 2 months or more annually, and most of the children with persis - tent AR were impaired in their daily activities. At 7 years of age, seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) de - veloped in 15% of the children. Children with SAR already in the second year of life were all born in spring or early summer. Risk fac - tors for SAR were male sex, atopic parents having SAR themselves, first-born child, early sensitization to food and atopic dermatitis. The Follow-up of the German MAS at 20 years of age showed that rhinitis was still the most frequent outcome observed. 290 individuals developed 'allergic rhi - nitis' within 13,179 person years observed. The risk to develop AR was higher with parents' history of AR (adjusted hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: [1.94; 3.27]), allergic sensitization (4.50 [3.30;6.13]), eczema within the first three years (1.88 [1.43;2.48]), Birth cohorts studies in allergic rhinitisSusanne Lau Charit\u00e9 Medical University Berlin, Germany67GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION B - Allergic rhinitis - epidemiology and risk factors male sex (1.28 [1.01;1.61]) and birthday in summer or autumn (1.26 [1.00;1.59]) were independ - ent predictors of AR up to age 20.

Non-atopic rhini - tis remission was highest in early life and reduced in later child - hood/adolescence. In the Norwegian Environment and Childhood Asthma Study cur - rent rhinitis was reported in 254 of 1019 children (25%) at age 10 years. Children with rhinitis and allergic sensitization had more fre - quently bronchial hyperreactivity. IS ALLERGIC RHINITIS PART OF THE ATOPIC MARCH? In European birth cohort studies AR is found in 10-25% of children and adolescents depending on the recruitment area. While in some cohorts it appears that early atop - ic eczema and early sensitisation to foods and inhalant allergens appears to be a risk factor for lat - er airway disease, other cohorts have reported a heterogeneous developmental profile for eczema, wheeze and rhinitis. In the British ALSPAC and MAAS cohorts, ap - plying Bayesian machine learning methods in order to identify dis - tinct latent classes only 7% of chil - dren were found to follow trajec - tory profiles resembling the atopic march. An analysis of 12 ongoing Euro - pean birth cohort studies partici - pating in MeDALL (Mechanisms in the Development of ALLergy) in - cluded over 16.000 children aged 4 years and 11080 aged 8 years. Comorbidity of eczema, rhinitis and asthma was investigated and defined as coexistence of two or three diseases in the same child. 1.6% of children were found to have comorbidity at age 4 years and 2.2% of the children at age 8 years. Strikingly, IgE sensitisa - tion was not the dominant causal mechanism of comorbidity. In a Swedish publication, 32.7% of children with mild eczema and 45% of children with mod - erate-to-severe eczema showed also rhinitis, favouring the conclu - sion, severity of eczema is as - sociated with rhinitis and allergic airway disease. Furthermore, at age 12 years, 7.5% of the children in the BAMSE cohort were affect - ed by at least two allergy-related diseases. In the German MAS AR until the age of 5 years was found to be a predictor for developing wheez - ing between the ages of 5 and 13 years, with an adjusted relative risk of 3.82 (p<0.001). This asso - ciation was not attributable to the type of sensitization, the severity of sensitization, or atopic dermati - tis during the first 2 years of life. In this group of children, 41.5% of all new cases of wheezing occurred among children with preceding AR (figure 3). ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND OTITIS MEDIA In the Danish COPSAC birth co - hort (Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood) 291 children in the 6th year of life were evaluated for asthma, allergic and non-allergic rhinitis, eczema and also for otitis media with effusion. Otitis media with effusion was diagnosed in 39% of the cohort and this was associated with AR (aOR 3.36; CI 1.26-8.96; p=0.02) but not with EFFECT ated with severer atopic eczema and skin barrier dysfunction, with asthma and poor lung function at school age and in some stud - ies also with rhinitis. In the Isle of Wight study, filaggrin gene vari - ants increased the risk of asthma (RR 1.3; 95% CI 1.06-1.80) sensitisation modulated and in - creased the risk for asthma, this could not be shown for rhinitis. This supports the interpretation, that rhinitis and asthma in child - hood and adolescence do not nec - essarily follow a common pathway in the group of children carrying the filaggrin mutations. In another pooled analyses certain single nucleotide polymorphisms within the TLR4 and TNF genes increased the risk of AR in chil - dren. Traffic related air pollution was not a relevant effect modifier. MOLECULAR SPREADING IN THE PRECLINICAL PHASE OF AR The development of AR seems to be determined by the develop - ment of specific sensitization. In the case of grass pollen sensitiza - tion in the German MAS, an initial IgE response to an initiator mole - cule, in > 75% of cases Phl p1 in a preclinical phase, precedes a more complex sensitization to several molecules: Phl p 4, Phl p 5, Phl p 2, Phl p 6 and Phl p 11 and later Phl p 12 and Phl p 7. Sensitization at age 3 predicted SAR by age 12 years (PPV 68%; 95% CI, 80-87%). At this early preclinical prediction time, the number of recognized molecules and the serum levels of IgE to Phleum pratense were sig - nificantly lower than at 3 or more years after the clinical onset of Birth cohorts studies in allergic rhinitis70GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION B - Allergic rhinitis - epidemiology and risk factors Figure 3 The risk of wheezing is determined by preceding allergic rhinitis in the German MAS.

These SNPs are then associated with the phenotype of allergic rhi - nitis (AR) in either a family-based or a case control study design. AR is an IgE-mediated inflammato - ry disease of the nasal mucosa. It can occur with or without asthma or eczema, the two other primary allergic conditions. Relatively few GWAS studies have been reported in AR. The initial paper documented MRPL4 (Mitochondrial ribosomal suggestive associations without genome-wide signifi - cance. A large European study then identified one genome-wide signif - icant locus for AR: chromosome 30 C11orf30 ). A meta-analysis of genome-wide associations with self-reported cat, dust-mite, and pollen allergies among Europeans identified 16 shared susceptibility loci, including 8 previously associated with asth - ma. Most recently, a North Amer - ican integrative genomics study GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION STUDIES IN ALLERGIC RHINITIS 4 KEY MESSAGES (figure 1) utilizing both GWAS and gene expression identified a locus near transcription factor FER3-Like (FERDL3 ) on chromosome 7p21.1 as a genome-wide significant AR susceptibility locus across ethnic groups, in addition to four ge - nome-wide significant loci among Latinos specifically. The integrative analysis with gene expression data implicated a gene module enriched for mitochondrial pathway genes (figure 2). Although other studies have examined AR and asthma or AR and atopic dermatitis, these 4 studies are the only ones that fo - cus exclusively on AR as a disease. Methodologically these studies seem sound in that they have some form of replication, are of large sample size, and all have addressed the major validity threat of popula - tion stratification. The existing literature supports the involvement of mitochondri - al genes, genes related to B cells and epithelial barrier function and regulatory T cell function as being of prime importance in AR. Future directions will need to go in the direction of the recently published integrative genomics paper where gene expression and GWAS data were integrated in one analysis and a systems genomics approach using pathway models was imple - mented. This methodology holds great promise in helping to deter - mine the underlying pathobiology of AR. One of the positive advan - tages that are available in AR is that investigators can obtain nasal cells from lavage or biopsy and use these cells to perform multi Omic studies including metabolo - mics and microRNA studies.

Epigenetic mechanisms include DNA methylation, which in general inhibits mRNA expres - sion and modifications of chro - matin structure, such as histone proteins, which may either deny or facilitate binding of transcrip - tion factors to promoter regions. Several studies have shown the importance of DNA methylation in T-cell differentiation as well as indifferent T-cell subsets from asthmatic patients, as recently re - viewed. SAR is an excellent model to study such mechanisms, because the main environmental trigger, pol - len, is known and the effects of allergen exposure can be studied in vitro by allergen challenge of pe - ripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients outside of the season. Moreover, changes during tolerance induction by al - lergen immunotherapy (3) can also be studied. However, there are rel - atively few studies of epigenetic mechanisms in SAR. One recent KEY MESSAGES study suggests that the beneficial effects of AIT may be due to in part to reduced DNA methylation of the FoxP3 promoter region in T regulatory cells. Several studies in mouse models of SAR have also observed changes in DNA meth - ylation as key regulatory of genes expression in CD4+ T-cells (Figure 1). To identify changes in DNA meth - ylation in SAR patients, we gener - ated genome-wide DNA methyla - tion and gene expression profiles of ex vivo CD4+ T-cells from SAR patients and healthy controls. DNA methylation profiles clearly separated SAR patients from con - trols, during and outside the pol - len season. Moreover, a significant correlation between symptom scores and DNA methylation was found. Conversely, gene expres -sion profiles of the same samples failed to separate patients and controls. Separation by methyla - tion but not by gene expression was also observed in an in vitro model system in which purified PBMCs from patients and healthy controls were challenged with al - lergen. These findings highlight the potential of DNA methylation as a biomarker useful for the strat - ification of SAR. DNA methyla - tion has also diagnostic potential, since it's more stable and easy to measure than mRNA and perhaps proteins. Finally, unlike genetic changes, epigenetic enzyme activity and epigenetic profiles are readily al - tered by several approved drugs and nutrients, such as vitamins C or D.

THE HYGIENE HYPOTHESIS AND GENE EXPRESSION In epidemiological studies, immu - nological mechanisms underpin - ning the hygiene hypothesis have been extensively studied using gene expression (Figure 1). The hygiene hypothesis states that environmental exposures to high levels of microbial components, such as occurring in the tradition - al farming setting, are one of the major preventive factors for the development of allergic diseases, such as allergic rhinitis (AR) and or for the sensitization to inhalant allergens. In fact such environ -KEY MESSAGES ments up-regulate the expression of pattern-recognition receptor genes such as Toll-like receptors (TLR) and the expression of genes of their signaling cascade. Fur - thermore, the gene expression of regulatory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF- in blood leukocytes is strongly induced among farmers' children (Figure 2). There are evidences that the pro - tective effect of farm exposures against the occurrence of allergic diseases could already be effec - tive during pregnancy. Exposure of pregnant mothers to farm sta - bles is associated with an increase of gene expression of receptors of the innate immunity, TLR2, TLR4 and CD14 (Figure 2). Results from a birth cohort show that an in -creased gene expression of innate immunity receptors at birth is pro - tective against the development of atopic dermatitis. CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS AND GENE EXPRESSION Evidence for a defective barrier function is shown in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Bi - opsies of patients with CRS have a decreased gene expression of tight junction (TJ) genes occludin and zonula occludens 1 that is as - sociated with a disruption of the epithelial integrity. The relative importance of primary (genetic) vs secondary (inflammatory) changes in TJ gene expression needs fur - ther study.

AR has an impact on qual - ity of life, performance at school/ work and socioeconomic burden. The onset of this IgE-mediated disease in children usually suc - ceeds the development of atop - ic dermatitis (AD) and childhood asthma, being often related to one or both. Different phenotypes were described differentiating be - tween local and systemic AR. EARLY LIFE DETERMINANTS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS While several studies have shown that perinatal influences alter immune regulation early in life and subsequent development of allergic diseases such as child - hood asthma, studies on early life mechanisms for AR alone are rare. This is due to its interrelation with AD and asthma, to partly shared mechanisms, and to its' later on - set mostly succeeding AD and asthma. A variety of underlying factors are relevant during a peri - natal \"window\", where disease de - velopment may be originated with KEY MESSAGES symptoms succeeding later in life. In the following, primarily studies on early life determinants of AR are included (Figure 1). Role of family history, infections and environmental exposure for AR development A family history of atopy is a known risk factor for AR development. In two German studies (Multicenter Allergy cohort with 820 children, PAULA study with 526 children), parental hay fever or maternal at - opy, infections, and bacterial expo - sure, respectively, were related to higher risk of AR in the offspring, importantly before the onset of symptoms, potentially acting as immunomodulators enhancing or inhibiting the development of AR. Farm exposure early in life protect - ing from AR is certainly one of the strongest factors shown repetitive - ly, similar to asthma prevention.Recent studies on the microbiome indicate that reduced bacterial diversity of the infants' intesti - nal flora was associated with in - creased risk of AR, but not with asthma or AD. Genetics and epigenetics in the development of AR Genetics are partially impor - tant in AR development, how - ever not necessarily sharing the same susceptibility loci. Despite the high prevalence of AR, only three GWASs of AR have been reported identifying key genes such as MRPL4, BCAP, C11orf30/ LRRC32 and FERD3L (Table 1). C11orf30/LRRC32 was relevant in GWAS for AR, asthma and AD. While overlapping loci may in - dicate a progression of allergic diseases from childhood AD to AR and asthma (\"atopic march), a close relationship between AR and Perinatal influences on the development of allergic rhinitisBianca Schaub University Children\u00b4s Hospital Munich Munich, Germany 781GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION B - Allergic rhinitis - epidemiology and risk factors asthma may indicate the concept of united airways\" from early life onwards. Certainly, epigenetic ef - fects, gene-gene interactions and gene-environment interactions have to be investigated in future genetic studies on AR. Epigenetics , namely acquired and potentially reversible modi - fications that do not include al - terations in the primary DNA se - quence, comprise regulation via DNA methylation, histone modifi - cation, and non-coding RNAs and are likely to contribute to the en -vironmental origins of asthma and its phenotypic variability. For AR alone, very few studies have been reported, with one differentiating AR vs controls by epigenetics fo - cusing on promoter CpGs of PIE - ZO1, RPP21 and HLA-DMA. Early life nutrition and supple - mentation Maternal vitamin D intake during pregnancy increased the risk for asthma and had no effect for AR in the offspring. Early introduc - tion of fish has repetitively been shown to decrease the risk of AR, and also of asthma, besides other foods (e.g. wheat, rye, oats, barley cereals, egg). A murine birch pol - len allergy model suggests that administration of L. paracasei , a probiotic bacteria during pregnan - cy/lactation protects the offspring against airway inflammation via TLR2/4-signalling. Human studies are controversial, lately showing no effect of probiotic mixtures for AR incidence until age 5, solely in the group of offspring delivered via caesarian section.Viral infections Allergic rhinitis Airway B DMA Figure 1 Early life determinants of AR.

However the farm effect for hay fever and atopic sensitization could not be completely accounted for by these exposure and remains partially unexplained The relationship between farm exposure and allergy/hay fev er prevalence is extremely dynamic over time, pointing to the impact of rapidly changing environments on allergy risk Continued exposure might be a critical component of the protective effects of farmingThe association between expo - sure to a farming environment and protection from allergic dis - ease (among which allergic rhini - tis/hay fever is paradigmatic) has proven extremely robust across studies, countries and continents, especially in work focusing on truly traditional farms. A recent, large (>8,000 children) study that sought to identify distinct expo - sures that account for the protec - tive effect of farming found that children living on a farm were at significantly reduced risk of hay fever (aOR, 0.43; 95% CI, .001) compared with nonfarm children. Of note, where - as this overall farm effect could be explained by specific exposures to cows, straw, and farm milk for asthma, and exposure to fodder storage rooms and manure for at - opic dermatitis, the farm effect on hay fever and atopic sensitization could not be completely explained by the questionnaire items them - selves or their diversity. Therefore, the link for hay fever and atopy is still missing. Interestingly, a high number of siblings, especially old - er siblings, reduces hay fever risk in childhood, and farming families are typically larger in size. Howev -KEY MESSAGES er, an inverse association between farm exposure and hay fever was found in all sizes of family, with no substantial tendency to satu - ration or synergism. This suggests that these two protective factors may act through distinct biological mechanisms. How strikingly dynamic the rela - tionship between prevalence of allergy and farming can be is elo - quently illustrated by the results of two surveys performed in 2003 and 2012 in lower Silesia, Poland (Figure 1). In 2003, among those living in Sob\u00f3tka (a town of just 4000 inhabitants) the prevalence of atopy was 20%, that is, similar to that observed in the United Kingdom and similar to Europe - an countries. In contrast, among those living in any of seven small villages, each no more than 10 km from the town, the prevalence of atopy was just 7%, that is, lower than any recorded elsewhere in Europe. At that time, 55% of vil - lagers (but <1% of those living in Sob\u00f3tka) described themselves as living on farms.

In 2004, Po - land joined the European Union and consequently adopted the Common Agricultural Policy. As a result, it immediately became une - conomic for village farmers in Sile - sia to keep small numbers of cows or other large farm animals. The number of cows and pigs kept by households in the seven villages decreased by 80%. When, in 2012, a second survey of the same area was undertaken, the results were impressive. Far fewer villagers had contact with cows (4% vs 24.3% in 2003) or pigs (14% vs 33.5%), milked cows (2.7% vs 12.7%), or drank unpasteurized milk (9% vs 35%). In parallel, the prevalence of atopy significantly increased among the villagers (7.3% vs 19.6%, P < .0001) but not among the townspeople (20% vs 19.9%). Hay fever increased over 2-fold in the villages (3.0% vs 7.7%) but not in the town (7.1% vs 7.2% (Figure 1). It is especially noteworthy that increased allergy prevalence was detected across all ages.The dramatic increase in the prev - alence of allergies observed in Poland within 9 years, and similar findings from urban Germany af - ter reunification (where the prev - alence of atopy doubled within 3 years), suggest that the atopic state is more plastic than many believe in both childhood and adulthood, and highlight the im - pact of rapidly changing environ - ments on allergy risk. They also suggest that continued exposure might be a critical component of the protective effects of farming. KEY REFERENCES 1. von Mutius E, Vercelli D.

Fur - thermore, innate immune cells (e.g. epithelial cells, macrophages, den - dritic cells) can convert the precur - sor 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 to the active metabolite 1 ,25-dihydrox - yvitamin D3 (Figure 1), supporting a role for extra-renal synthesis of vitamin D and regulation of im - mune function. Vitamin D modulates many as - pects of immune function (Figure 2). Vitamin D enhances innate antimicrobial mechanisms that aid pathogen clearance, increas - es the frequency of CD4+IL-10+ and CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cell subsets, and inhibits pro-inflam - matory Th1 and Th17 responses, both directly and via effects on antigen presenting cells.

Vitamin D3 is obtained from dietary sources, or more commonly metabolized following ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation (from sunshine) of 7-dehydrocholesterol in skin. The enzyme 25-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) in the liver converts vitamin D3 to the major circulating metabolite 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3), and then 1 -hydroxylase (CYP27B1), in the kidney and locally in tissues, to the active moiety 1 ,25- dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1 ,25(OH)2D3). 1 ,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 binds to the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which forms a heterodimer with members of the retinoic acid (RXR) family; this complex translocates to the nucleus and engages the vitamin D response element (VDRE) to mediate gene transcription. 1 ,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is rapidly inactivated by CYP24A1 to 1,24,25(OH)3D3 and calcitroic acid.

The tremendous rise in incidence during the last decades emphasiz - es the importance of environmen - tal factors in the manifestation of the disease. In order to develop prevention measures for people at risk, effort has been put into the identification of genetic and envi - ronmental risk factors. GENETIC PREDISPOSITION In genome-wide - ies (GWAS), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associat - ed with AR were identified. The respective genes - among them IL-18, LRRC32, TLR6, TSLP and NOD1 - govern mechanisms in - volved in innate immunity, im - mune regulation and crosstalk of epithelial cells and immune cells (figure 1). Epithelial barrier genes were not identified. This implies that they might play a more prom - inent role in atopic eczema and in asthma than in AR. In contrast to other atopic traits, the genet - ic susceptibility to AR seems less clear. This is likely due to fact that patients with AR often develop KEY MESSAGES asthma, resulting in an overlap of phenotypes. In line with this, some results were not replicated in meta-analyses. ANTHROPOGENIC ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS Anthropogenic environmental factors, such as air pollutants, can impact directly on human health, but can also indirectly influence patients via their interaction with allergens (environment-en - vironment interactions) (figure 2). For the direct effects, popula - tion-based studies show relation - ships between allergic sensitiza - tion/AR symptoms and long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollutants, such as Diesel exhaust particles, fine particulate matter, NO2 and ozone. However, a re - cent meta-analysis did not show any clear correlation between AR and anthropogenic pollutants. These inconsistencies likely re - flect methodological differences. in study design, measurement of pollutant exposure or differences in outcome between short-term and long-term exposure. For the indirect effects on human health, ozone was shown to enhance the allergenicity of birch pollen, a highly relevant allergen for AR. Moreover, prolonged flowering seasons and increases in pollen load as a consequence of global warming might increase AR bur - den.

Genome-wide association studies identified polymorphisms in several genes that may be linked to allergic rhinitis (AR). These genes are involved in different steps of the pathomechanism of AR, i.e. recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, epithelial cell-immune cell crosstalk, T helper cell differentiation and immune cell chemotaxis.

Traffic-related air pollutants associated with the development of AR include particulate matter (PM), Diesel exhaust particles (DEP), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3). These pollutants have a direct effect on asthma and cardiovascular diseases. Their effect on AR remains ambiguous. However, air pollutants enhance the expression of allergenic proteins and adjuvants in pollen, and can therefore influence AR patients indirectly. Global warming might contribute to the rising trend in allergies due to increases in allergenic pollen load.

By revisiting the \"hygiene hypoth - esis\", it becomes increasingly clear that the developing immune system is shaped by pre-natal or early life exposure to pathogens and coloniz - ing microbiota. In genetically pre - disposed individuals, disturbance of this intricate crosstalk causes immune dysregulation, resulting in autoimmunity or allergy.

AR is a complex disease triggered by genetic and environmental factors. Protection is conferred early in life when a favorable genetic background encounters protective environmental factors, such as an intact microbial flora and certain microbial pathogens. In contrast, allergen exposure induces allergic disease if an unfavorable genetic background meets harmful environmental factors, such as an imbalanced microbial flora. Cesarean section delivery and excessive antibiotic use can alter the body\u00b4s microflora and might therefore cause immune dysregulation. KEY REFERENCES 1.

Indeed, the 'human superorgan - ism', consists of 1% human DNA and 99% microbial DNA. The nasopharyngeal microbiota has been well described, is considered distinct from other body sites, and amongst its constituents are bacteria that are considered path - ogens, for example, Streptococcus pneumonia , Haemophilius aureus and Mo- raxella catarrahlis . However, overt disease is typically not evident unless these bacterial species be - come dominant at the expense of other resident microbes. This is a state of 'dysbiosis' and is often associated with inflammation. The factors that allow this microbial dysbiosis to develop could be key to a deeper understanding of dis - ease aetiology, susceptibility and future therapeutic or prevention strategies. FACTORS SHAPING THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE MICROBIOTA Many factors can modulate the KEY MESSAGES composition of the nasopharyn - geal microbiota, such as vacci - nation strategies and exposure to microbes present in different environments/ climates/ sea - sons. As examples, studies have shown that respiratory tract viral infections can profoundly impact on local bacterial populations, and that the microbiota is differ - ent between summer and winter. Recently, the development of the upper respiratory tract microbiota was tracked over the first 2 years of life, and found to develop and cluster into certain groups. For ex - ample, breast-feeding was associ - ated with a more stable microbiota with high abundance of Moraxella and Corynebacterium / Dolosigran - ulum , of - rental-reported respiratory infec -tions. Comparatively, less stable microbial profiles were linked with high abundance of Haemophilus or Streptococcus . Studies of the na - sal microbiota of individuals with or without allergic rhinitis have clearly showed that this disease is associated with changes in mi - crobial diversity and constituents. Is this cause or effect? Do certain microbes predispose to allergies, or do allergies create tissue envi - ronments suitable for these mi - crobes?

This reduction in innat e immune anti-viral responses may predispose them to develop AR that results from frequent URTIsMany clinicians and parents ques - tion whether frequent upper res - piratory tract infections (URTIs) in early childhood can increase the risk for the development of aller - gic rhinitis (AR). Frequent URTIs are defined as viral infections of the nose or ears occurring more then six times per year. AR is a combination of congestion, sneez - ing, and rhinorrhea with associat - ed pruritus of the nose and eyes due to demonstrable aeroallergen sensitivity. The link between infection and the development of AR is com - plex, exemplified by the incon - sistent and conflicting results of various epidemiologic studies. These observed discrepancies appear to be due to variability of host factors. Some studies show an inverse association between URTIs and AR, while others show no association. Interestingly, any observed association or increased risk appears to be greater in chil - dren with a family history of atop - ic disease. Indeed, these children show increased rates of atopy if they experience early URTIs. In observations supporting the hygiene hypothesis, Svanes et al found the number of siblings at home and day care enrollment KEY MESSAGES was inversely proportional to the risk of AR development. Assuming that the number of siblings and day care could be surrogate mark - ers for URTI frequency, this study suggested that frequent URTIs in childhood are inversely related to the development of AR. However, a more recent pro - spective birth cohort study by Balemans et al found no associa - tion between recurrent URTIs in childhood and the development of AR. The authors concluded that URTI in childhood do not reduce the risk of AR in young adulthood. Conversely, Lee et al found that high-risk children with a family history of asthma or atopic sen - sitization have increased rates of AR when exposed to parainflu -enza virus and picornavirus in the first year of life. The discrepancy in research find - ings among the various studies may be due to differences in im - munologic response profiles in the children experiencing these viral illnesses. For example, children with an atopic phenotype have been shown to have decreased vi - rus-induced interferon (IFN)-alpha production compared to healthy controls. Since IFN-alpha is both antiviral and immunoregulatory, any observed differences could be attributed to differences in these host response patterns. Thus, if a child has an atopic phenotype, their innate immunoinflammatory responses may predispose them to the development of AR.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) is often con - trasted to infectious rhinitis/ common cold, as a rhinitis entity whose pathophysiological mech - anism is driven by atopy instead of infection. Although the under - lying pathophysiology of common cold and AR is viewed as radically different, their clinical manifes - tations do not differ much and it is often challenging to set apart these two conditions by clinical criteria.

HRV in particular, causes both bronchial and nasal eosinophilia, which - important - ly - is prolonged in asthmatic and rhinitic patients (Figure 3). HRV infection is often more severe in atopic individuals, as infection-in - duced, interferon-mediated in - nate responses are differentially regulated in these patients and viral replication is increased in a Th2 environment. Also, the de - gree of antibody-mediated pro - tection from HRV infection may be suboptimal in atopic subjects. In fact, it appears that the interac -tions between HRV and the atopic state could be so robust that the actual presence of allergen is not required for the increased sever - ity of the symptoms of infection. Nevertheless, if a sensitized indi - vidual is exposed to the allergen in the context of an HRV infection, an augmented reaction could en - sue. Indeed, in AR patients, aller - gen challenge after an HRV infec - tion leads to increased bronchial eosinophil accumulation and en - hanced and persistent release of histamine. In all, atopy appears to be a risk factor for increased severity of the common cold infection. Inversely, allergen exposure concurrent to infection can lead to an exagger - ated allergic reaction. These are important interactions between two pathophysiological mecha - nisms that, at first look, appear to be different. AR and the common cold in aller - gic individuals have more in com - mon than initially meets the eye: their symptoms tend to overlap (as is especially true for rhinor - rhoea and sneezing and less so for obstruction and itching) and their pathophysiologies, albeit didacti - cally distinct, are interconnected.

Tolerance to animal dander can be seen either as lack of IgE production or as progressive decrease in symptoms with prolonged exposure Community prevalence of animal ownership is an important determinant of the levels of cat allergen in schools and ho mes without a cat The impact of a dog in the house is complex because they introduce a wide range of bacteria into the house as well as being a source of allergenThe significance of skin tests or IgE antibodies for cat or dog allergens has been appreciated by physicians who were interested in allergic dis - ease for many years. However, the relationship between exposure to animal allergens and sensitiza - tion has been less clear. For many years, it was assumed that cat or dog ownership was the prima - ry factor in specific sensitization. Many allergists in practice went further and say that a positive skin test for cat was only relevant to asthma or allergic rhinitis (AR) if the patient had an animal at home. It was therefore a surprise when Hesselmar et al. reported that sub - jects living in a house with a cat were less likely to become sensi - tized to cat allergens. Subsequent studies rapidly confirmed this find - ing for cats and dogs (Figure 1). At the same time, it became clear that animal dander allergens not only remained airborne in the home but were present in homes without a cat as well as in schools, offices and other public places. One of the problems with assess - ing the role of cat allergens in AR is that exposure is perennial and that there are very few studies that have successfully decreased expo - sure sufficiently to answer ques -KEY MESSAGES Furry animals - risk or protective factor for allergic rhinitis? 14 Alexander J. Schuyler Thomas A. E. Platts-Mills University of Virginia Charlottesville, USA tions about the role of cat allergens induced-symptoms. In addition, controlled trials of cat allergen immunotherapy (AIT) for AR have generally not been carried out on allergic subjects who do not have an animal in their house. Investiga - tion of the effects of animal own - ership has given different results in different communities. In some studies, the protective effect of cat ownership appeared to be at least partly explained by the removal of pets by families with allergic chil - dren. However many studies have confirmed a strong protective ef - fect of early dog or cat ownership. Since it is clear than many patients who do not live in a house with a cat become sensitized it is impor - tant to consider what influences the quantity of cat allergens in schools or homes without a cat. The best data comes from schools in Stockholm, where it has been clearly shown that the quantity of cat allergen in a room is directly related to the number of children in the class who have a cat at home. The obvious implication is that the quantity of cat allergen in homes without a cat is likely to be influenced by the number of the homes in the community where animals are kept. Indeed, in some areas of the United States animals are not kept at all or are kept out - side only. In these predominantly, African-American communities, the prevalence of cat allergy is generally very low.

CONCLUSIONS All animals produce allergens and can induce specific sensitization. However, a large range of studies shows that in a community where 20% to 40% of the families have a cat, those children without a cat at home are equally if not more likely to be sensitized. Even if the prev - alence of sensitization is equal among children without a cat, 80% to 60% of the allergic children will not have an animal at home. Thus the presence of animals in a community can be the or a major risk factor for sensitization even though children who are exposed from early childhood are less likely to become sensitized. By contrast for animals such as rabbits which are much less common in homes, it is the patients who live with the animals that have the main risk. It is clear that the current situation is not simple and not surprising - ly it is not easy to make a simple case about the clinical relevance of a positive skin test to animal dander.

There is already a significant body of evidence indicating that climate change is measurably altering the timing, distribution, quality, and quantity of allergenic plants and aeroaller - gens. Such changes are occurring via meteorological factors and through interactions with green- house gases and air pollutants, and may affect both the incidence and prevalence of AR, as well as the severity of symptoms. Despite the strong evidence demonstrating climate-induced changes on allergenic plants and aeroallergens and the known causal relationship between aer - oallergens and AR onset and prevalence, studies examining as - sociations between climatic fac - tors and AR have yielded mostly inconsistent results. This may be because climatic effects on aer - oallergens and thus presumably on AR are likely to vary by geogra - phy and vegetation type. Studies that incorporate data from several geographical areas and climates are required. However, to date, KEY MESSAGES Allergic rhinitis prevalence and climate change: a global ecologic analysis 15 only very few studies have exam - ined associations between climat - ic factors and AR using data from more than one country. The most recent effort utilized data collected by the worldwide International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood survey (3). In addition to identifying variation in the global distribution of both intermittent (Figure 1) and persis - tent rhinitis symptom prevalences among children, this ecological study reported on several spatial associations between climatic fac - tors and the prevalence of these allergic conditions on a global scale. Associations appeared most consistent for intermittent rhi - nitis symptoms when examining country-level (between-country, Figure 2) associations, whereas associations with persistent rhi - nitis symptoms were more con - sistent at the center-level (with - in-country associations, Figure 3). The overall trend reported in this paper was a generally positive as - sociation between mean monthly temperature and vapor pressure (which were highly correlated) and several measures of precipitation, with rhinitis symptom prevalence.

Cockro ach allergens can be an important risk factors for allergic rhin itis (AR) in some parts of the world Cleaning and other hygienic measures can reduce allergen exposure but it is more unclear if they reduce allergic sy mptoms Dampness and indoor mould growth are well-established risk factors for AR, but the causative factors are not clearly identified and can differ between different climate zones Chemical emissions from recent redecoration and new buildin g materials can be a risk factor for AR but the mechanisms are n ot well understood A sufficient ventilation flow in homes is important to reduce the exposure to particles and volatile organic compounds and to reduce the risk for building dampness and indoor mould growthAllergic rhinitis (AR) occurs when an allergen triggers nasal - toms in a sensitized individual, while non-allergic rhinitis (NAR) is triggered by non-allergic and non-infectious agents. In epide - miological studies, it is often diffi - cult to distinguish between these two types of rhinitis and moreover non-allergic indoor factors can act as adjuvant factors for AR. House dust mites (HDM) allergy is a com - mon cause of allergic asthma and AR, affecting 65-130 million per - sons globally, but the translation of the silent sensitization into symptomatic disease is still not well understood. Allergen sources are common in the home environ - ment, including furry pets (cat and dogs), rats and mice, cockroaches, house dust mites, tropical storage mite ( Bloomia sp benjamina and Yucca elephantipes ) (Table 1). Non-allergic factors in - cludes particle pollutants (PM10 and PM2.5), environmental to - bacco smoke (ETS), formaldehyde, volatile organic compounds (VOC) from new building materials and consumer products (Table 1 and Figure 1).KEY MESSAGES 16 Building dampness and mould growth on indoor surfaces or in the construction are common in homes and could cause rhinitis in children and adults. Recently large studies in children and adults on AR have been published, e.g. from Asia. Presence of cockroaches was associated with AR in studies from China and France and with current rhinitis in China. In studies from China and Korea, recent redeco - ration and moving to a new home was associated with AR. However, one study from France found that new particle board in the home, a well-known source of formal - dehyde emissions, was associat - ed only with NAR. Windowpane condensation in wintertime is an indicator of a combination of poor ventilation and high air humidity and has been associated with AR in China and Sweden.

Work-rela ted ocular-nasal symptoms are also a strong predictor of work exacerbated asthma Occupational exposures may also be involved in more severe forms of chronic rhinosinusitisOCCUPATIONAL AND WORK- EXACERBATED RHINITIS Environmental agents at the work place may lead to work-related rhinitis. Work-related rhinitis can be caused by work - occupational rhinitis (OR) - or exacerbated by work (work-exacerbated rhinitis). OR can be divided into allergic and non-allergic OR. In general, allergic OR is charac - terized by a latency period i.e. a period between the start of expo - sure and the onset of symptoms whereas non-allergic OR might develop shortly after exposure (figure 1). Sensitizing agents - in most cases high molecular weight (HMW) allergens and sometimes low molecular weight (LMW) al - lergens - may induce an IgE medi - ated allergic reaction, responsible for allergic OR. Less frequently, single or multiple exposures to irritants will lead to non-allergic irritant-induced OR. Corrosive rhi - nitis is considered as the most se - vere form of irritant induced OR, characterized by persistent in - flammation. Ulcerations and per - foration of the nasal septum may be attributed to OR, but are more frequently seen in the context of cocaine sniffing and/or nose pick - ing.KEY MESSAGES 17 Apart from these occupational diseases caused by work, environ - mental stimuli at work may also lead to worsening of pre-existent rhinitis. There is some overlap between the different categories of eliciting agents. Sensitizers may also have irritating properties. Irritants may lead to OR, but also to worsen - ing of pre-existing rhinitis. Table 1 shows some examples of allergens and the corresponding occupa - tions responsible for OR. The level of exposure, atopy and smoking are considered as the main poten - tial determinants for the develop - ment of OR.CHRONIC RHINOSINISITIS Recent studies provide evidence that occupational exposures may also be involved in more severe forms of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Exposures at work appear to be a risk factor for the occur - rence, recurrence and persistence of CRS.

Outdoor pollution includes gases such as sulfur dioxide, ozone, nitrogen species, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter (PM) (coarse PM10, fine PM2.5, and ultrafine) and may contribute to the rising prevalence of allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma in westernized coun - tries (Table I). Air pollutants can be classified as primary/secondary, indoor/outdoor and as gaseous particulate (Table II). Studies have found that increased outdoor CO2 levels combined with increased temperatures cause ragweed plants to grow larger and produce increased pollen. Diesel-burning engines emit PM which has been demonstrated to cause and aggra - vate asthma and enhance allergic sensitization in children living in close proximity to high-traffic ar - eas. Ozone, a byproduct of die - sel exhaust, can increase inflam - mation in the airways of asthma patients. A study of school-aged children in Germany found an as - sociation with atopy but only in children living in homes exposed to air pollution from high motor vehicle traffic and environmen - tal tobacco smoke. A longitudi -KEY MESSAGES 18 nal study evaluated the effect of air pollution in causing atopy and asthma based on the child's geo - graphic location over seven years using exposure modeling and found that PM2.5 was associated with asthma, whereas nitrogen dioxide was associated with ecze - ma, and living a distance less than 50 m to the nearest road was as - sociated with asthma symptoms. In addition, another similar lon - gitudinal study found that diesel exhaust particles (DEP) exposure enhances the risk of early aeroal - lergen sensitization and was as -sociated with allergic rhinitis at 4 years of age. INDOOR POLLUTION Examples of indoor pollution in - clude cigarette smoke, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and vol - atile organic compounds (VOCs) (Table 2). VOCs are derived from chemical or microbial sources. Chemical VOCs include ketones and aldehydes like formaldehyde which emanate from building ma - terials including adhesives, carpet, cleaners, linoleum, furniture, paint, printers, textiles, personal care Environmental risk factors for allergic rhinitis - indoor and outdoor pollutionJonathan A. Bernstein University of Cincinnati College of Medicine Cincinnati, USA111GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION B - Allergic rhinitis - epidemiology and risk factors products, and chemically treat - ed clothing. High VOC levels (> 3000 g/m3) can cause mucous membrane irritation resulting in non-specific upper respiratory symptoms as well as fatigue, and difficulty concentrating. Use of solid biomass fuels is also a major source of indoor air pol - lution. This is especially true in underdeveloped countries where heating and cooking depends on these biomass fuels and when combined with poor ventilation results in repeated periods of emissions that have been asso - ciated with increased childhood respiratory infections and devel - opment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and malignancy. Studies have also investigated the health effects of air pollution during pregnancy and found that moderate- to long-term high air pollution exposure can alter T-cell production in neonates. Polyaro - matic hydrocarbons (PAHs), emit -ted from residential heating and gas appliances, may also impact the immunologic development of newborns. Studies have found that the number and duration of respiratory episodes were greater in infants exposed prenatally to higher levels of PAHs. In summary, there is overwhelm - ing evidence to support the health effects of air pollution on respira - tory health. However, many ques - tions remain unanswered which require further investigation.TABLE 1 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (adapted from http:/ /www.epa.gov/air/criteria.html) * Pollutant Primary standards Averaging times Secondary standards CO 9 ppm (10 mg/m3) 8-Hour None mean) primary PM10Revoked Annual (arithmetic mean) Revoked g/m324-Hour \u00a7 Same as primary PM2.5 g/m3Annual (arithmetic mean) Same as primary O30.08 ppm 8-Hour # Same as primary 0.12 ppm 1-Hour** (applies only in limited areas) Same as primary Sulfur oxides 0.03 ppm Annual (arithmetic mean) \u2014 \u2014 3-hour 0.5 ppm (1300 g/m3) * Primary standards, limits set to protect public health, especially sensitive subpopulations such as patients with asthma, the elderly, and children.

Commonly reported nasal symptoms include nasal itching and congestion, run- ny nose, and sneezing. Patients may also complain of ear symp- toms including ear fullness and popping. Often AR will involve the conjunctiva and as such patients may experience itching, burning, or tearful eyes. Other frequently associated symptoms are throat itching and post-nasal drip. Severe persistent AR may lead to snoring, mouth breathing, and sinus pressure symptoms. With chronic symptoms, children may often sniff, snort, and repeatedly clear their throats. While scratch- ing their itchy palates, children may also make a clicking sound called the \"palatal click.\" Table 1 provides an overview of common clinical features of AR. AR is often associated with classic physical findings as well. On nasal examination, the nasal cavity lin- ing will often appear pale or have a bluish hue in contrast to its normal pinkish hue.

Over time, this can lead to a transverse crease along the nose. Symptoms of AR are caused by an allergic reaction to allergens in the air. Depending on the allergen, symptoms may occur seasonally or year round. Common seasonal allergens include grasses, trees, weeds, and molds. Common year round or perennial allergens in- clude animal dander, molds, and dust mites. While seasonal allergic rhinitis tends to predominate in children and perennial in adults, individuals can have both types. AR is a global health problem. In addition to appropriate treatment, symptom recognition is important in managing and reducing morbid- ity in this increasingly prevalent disease. KEY REFERENCES 1.

Sensitization to inhal - ant allergens is the main risk fac - tor for allergic rhinitis (AR), asthma and allergic conjunctivitis. In addi - tion to the adaptive IgE immune response, many allergens engage adaptive immune responses via proteolytic actions to destroy pro - tective mucous layers in the air - ways or activate the protease ac - tivate receptor PAR2 to contribute to epithelial inflammation. CLASSIFICATION Inhalant allergens were tradi- tionally classified as seasonal or perennial, however the allergic rhinitis and its impact on asthma (ARIA) report has suggested a classification that relates to the duration of impact than an aller- gen has on allergic disease. For example grass pollen can be sea- sonal in a temperate region, but causes perennial disease in the tropics and sub-tropics. The pre- ferred nomenclature for inhalant allergens ALLERGIC RHINITIS: INHALANT ALLERGENS 2a KEY MESSAGES HOUSE DUST MITES Two common mites from the Der- matophagoides (Latin for 'skin eat - er') genus can cause allergic dis - ease: the European house dust mite (HDM) ( Dermatophagoides pteron - yssinus ) (Figure 1) and the American HDM ( Dermatophagoides farinae ); however these are not confined to their geographic titles and are pres - ent worldwide. In tropical regions, the tropical mite Blomia tropicalis is the major mite allergen. Der P1, a cysteine protease is the most char - acterised, and is a digestive enzyme that is excreted in mite faeces. Mites inhabit and thrive in conditions where there is skin and humidity, particularly bedding, but may in - habit furniture and carpet. Pillows can contain up to 2000 mites per gram of dust. Dust mites require moulds for digestion. In their life cycle, mites can lay about 70 eggs and produce 2000 allergenic faecal particles. Most mite reduction trials have methodological issues and a Cochrane review summarised that extensive bedroom-based environ - mental control measures may be of use in reducing perennial rhinitis symptoms. POLLENS Pollens are the male spores of plant seeds from trees, grasses and weeds. Pollen grains have a stur - dy outer shell and inner spores. As plants have evolved, pollens have developed a more complex outer structure (Figures 2 & 3). Tree pol - lens (e.g, birch, elm, olive, acacia, ash, cedar, pine) have a shorter and earlier duration of pollination and Triggers of allergic rhinitis: inhalant allergensPete Smith Griffith University Queensland Australia117GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION C - Allergic rhinitis - clinical features and co-morbiditiesmay release pollen for only a few weeks in spring. Grasses (e.g. Rye, Timothy, Orchard, Bermuda) have late spring and summer peaks and weeds (Ragweed/Ambrosia, Plan - tain, Sorrel) follow a similar release pattern, but also continue pollen release into autumn. In temperate zones weeds generally cease pollen release with the first freeze. Pollens can travel for miles, although some pollens (e.g. plantain and birch) are quite heavy and are not widely dispersed. Grass pollen release is increased 8-20 fold with the atmos - pheric changes of thunderstorms. MOULD Moulds are the major component found in environmental allergen traps. They thrive and reproduce in moist, dark environments such as dirt, wood, food, plant matter and animal matter. Common inhalant allergen species include, has been - ing cans and Epidermophyton . Most fun - gi have branching threads (hyphae, Figure 4). A mycelium is a cluster of hyphae. In addition to allergic disease several moulds (e.g. asper - gillus) cause invasive disease and are capable of producing volatile or - ganic compounds that cause airway irritation. Moulds are regarded as persistent allergens however spore release can increase dramatically with thunderstorms to produce an intermittent clinical disease pattern. DANDER Domestic cats and dogs are the most characterized pet allergens, although dander from a wide range of animals may cause inhalant al - lergic disease.

Cat allergens are very pervasive and resistant to elimination measures. Dog hair and saliva can provoke allergic symp - toms in sensitised individuals. OTHER INHALANT ALLERGENS A wide range of biological materi- als including feathers, insect ma- terials (e.g. cockroach, housefly) and latex can provoke inhalant allergic disease. DIAGNOSIS OF ALLERGY The clinical diagnosis of allergic disease requires symptomatolo- gy in the presence of the allergen and the presence of IgE on testing (skin prick, RAST and/or provoca- tion). Pollen maps (Figure 5) can be helpful when correlating dis- ease with posi- tive tests. Clinical disease caused by inhalant allergens can be enhanced by the presence of high ozone lev- els and pollutants including smoke and diesel ex- haust particles. KEY REFERENCES 1. W\u00fcthrich B.

The most common triggers are house dust mites, and grass, tree and weed pollen. In all cases, multiple species have been impli- cated, e.g. Blomia tropicalis for mites, pratense , Lolium perenne and Poa of the Fagales to which the Betulaceae (birch, alder and hazel) and the Juglan- daceae (walnut) families belong, and the order of the Lamiales with the family of the Oleaceae (olive and ash), and finally a variety of allergenic weeds such as the this- tle). Depending on climatic and socio-economic characteristics of the domicile of a patient, the ac- tual combined exposure to these potential triggers differs widely in composition.

Antibody responses as a read-out for expo- sure usually do not really give the answer either, because there is a high degree of antibody cross-re- activity between homologous al- lergens of different species of pol- len or of house dust mites, within a family or even across family (or even order) boundaries. The degree of cross-reactivity is correlated with the percentage of structural homology, which is de- termined by adjacency in the fam- ily tree (genealogical relationship). Both from a diagnostic and a ther- apeutic perspective it is important to be aware of cross-reactivity. Within a family, cross-reactivity is usually so extensive that both for diagnosis and for allergen im- munotherapy (AIT), a single high IgE-binding species is e.g. Pheum pratense for grass pol- Betula family, or Dermatophagoides ptero - nyssinus for mites. There is no con- vincing evidence that patients are selectively allergic to just one spe- cies of grass or tree pollen or one species of mites. A mix of allergen extracts for diagnosis or AIT may seem more comprehensive but in fact only complicates production and standardization. Cross-reactivity outside gene- alogical families caused by so- called pan-allergens may lead to confusion about the primary source of sensitization. For pol- len, profilins and cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants (CCD), and for arthropods tropomyosins are responsible for such broader cross-reactivity.

For allergenically important genealog- ical families, marker allergens for primary sensitization have been identified (Table 1). If these are negative, and only pan-allergens are responsible for IgE reactivity, clinical relevance is unlikely and AIT not warranted. KEY REFERENCES 1.

OCCUPATIONAL RHINITIS OR is the most frequent and rec- ognised form of WRR and can be allergic, i.e. medi- ated, and non-allergic, i.e. mediat- ed by irritant mechanisms. Occupational exposures inducing allergic OR are the same as for occupational asthma. High-mo - lecular-weight (HMW) agents such as glycoproteins from veg etal and animal origin (e.g. flours, latex, animal-derived and some low-molecular-weight (LMW) compounds (e.g. platinum salts, anhydrides) can cause aller - gic OR through an IgE-mediated mechanism.

An acute form of irritant-induced OR occurring without a latency period, after a single exposure to high levels of irritants at work is called ' reactive upper airways dysfunction syndrome ' (RUDS). Exposure to volatile organic sol- vents and pesticides has been associated to the development of RUDS. Symptoms of rhinitis may also present in subjects repeat- edly exposed at work to irritants (vapors, fumes, smokes, dusts), without any identifiable exposure to high concentration of irritants. This entity is recognized as multi-ple exposure irritant-induced OR. A variety of occupational expo- sures have been associated with this type of OR, including ozone, volatile organic compounds, fuel oil ash, grain and cotton dust, for- maldehyde, chlorine, wood dust, thermal degradation products of polyurethanes, and waste han- dling. The term 'corrosive rhinitis' describes the most severe form of irritant-induced OR, which is characterized by permanent in- flammation of the nasal mucosa, sometimes associated with ulcer- ations and perforation of the na- sal septum, that may develop after 122GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION C - Allergic rhinitis - clinical features and co-morbidities Figure 2 Occupational agents inducing occupational rhinitis according to their etiopathogenesis.

AR affects 30 % of the population and al- lergen-specific IgE plays a well- known central role. CRSwNP af- fects 4% of the population and is frequently associated with late onset intrinsic asthma. IgE in AR is monoclonal allergen-specific and polyclonal in CRSwNP.. Although this polyclonal IgE is functional, it does not point to comorbid al- lergic disease. The prevalence of allergy in CRSwNP, diagnosed by skin prick tests, has been report- ed to vary from 10 to 54%.. In- terestingly, allergen exposure in atopic nasal polyp (NP) patients does not clearly enhance disease expression, in contrast to patients with AR. The monoclonal IgE in AR reflects the allergic constitu- tion. The polyclonal IgE in atopic NP patients however suppresses atopic symptoms. AR does prob- ably not predispose to the devel- opment of NP, as their prevalence in the atopic population is similar to the general population, which in a French study was estimat- ed 2,11% of the adult popula- tion. The treatment of NP is still CO-MORBIDITIES OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS: NASAL allergic rhinitis: nasal polyposisproblematic because there are no effective medical treatments available and because of a high re- currence rate after surgical NP re- moval. Anti-IgE treatment appears to be effective in both atopic and non-atopic patients with CRSwNP and comorbid asthma, suggesting this 'non-atopic' IgE plays a pivotal role in CRSwNP. CRSwNP is frequently associated with late onset intrinsic asthma, and can be associated with aspirin intolerance. The triad CRSwNP, asthma and aspirin intolerance was termed Samter's triad and is actually known as aspirin-exac- erbated respiratory disease.. NP in Samter's triad are typically re- calcitrant and hard to treat, and asthma is likewise severe. Fur-thermore, asthma control is un- likely in uncontrolled CRSwNP. In contrast to AR associated asthma, co-morbid asthma in NP disease is mostly non-atopic and its onset is generally in the adult life. Thus, atopy cannot explain the pres- ence of co-morbid asthma in NP patients. It is thought that many factors contribute in the patho- genesis of CRSwNP, including col- onization with Staphylococcus au - reus. Their enterotoxins can act as superantigens resulting in an im- mune response of increased mag- nitude and a massive IgE response (Figure 1). The overexpression of IgE and IL5, and the presence of SE-specific IgE in CRSwNP is as- sociated with an increased risk of asthma (Figure 2).Philippe Gevaert Ghent University Hospital Ghent, Belgium125GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION C - Allergic rhinitis - clinical features and co-morbidities Co-morbidities of allergic rhinitis: nasal polyposis Figure 1 Enterotoxins derived from Staphylococcus aureus act as superantigens, resulting in high levels of polyclonal IgE.

Control is essential in the prevention of exacerba- tions. Treatment of CRSwNP fol- lowing the evidence-based EPOS management scheme (Figure 3) is indispensable to achieve control of co-morbid asthma. Recognition of aspirin intolerance in patients with CRSwNP is important to ed- ucate patients and to prevent life threatening responses. KEY REFERENCES 1.

Allergic conjunctivitis (AC) is a comorbidity of other al- lergic diseases in more than 90% of cases. Specifically, in allergic rhinitis (AR) sufferers the preva- lence of AC varies between 50-90 %. As noted by the Phase III ISAAC Study the prevalence of ARC in children is increasing worldwide and rises through childhood (8.5% at 6-7 years and 14.6% at 13-14 years). No significant gender dif- ferences have been described in the prevalence of ARC. AC can be seasonal (SAC) or perennial (PAC). SAC and PAC are the most com- mon forms of ocular allergy. AC is characterized by itching, hy- peremia, watering and chemosis. Vision is not affected, but symp- toms can be highly bothersome with a significant impact on pro- ductivity and quality of life. AC is related to both direct allergen contact with conjunctival mucosa as well as indirect contact via a na- sal-ocular reflex. In SAC and PAC common environmental allergens lead to an inappropriate immuno- globulin E production and immu- nological sensitization. When ALLERGIC allergic rhinitis: ocular allergysequently exposed to the allergen, these antibodies can initiate mast cell degranulation and the entire allergic response. SAC and PAC in- volve an immediate (type I) hyper- sensitivity response. In SAC mast cells (MC) are the main infiltrat- ing cells in the conjunctiva, with secreted products primarily or- chestrating the inflammatory re- sponse. In PAC the inflammation is more chronic, with involvement of activated MC, eosinophils, neu- trophils and some T cells. SAC (Figure 1) occurs at the same time each year and recurs season- ally with the changes in pollens and allergens present. Symptoms tend to last a few weeks each year and may vary with the pollen count. Grass pollens tend to cause symptoms in early summer, usual-ly from April through to July. Oth- er pollens may cause symptoms as early as February or March or as late as September. PAC (Figure 2) persists throughout the year. It is most commonly due to an allergy to house dust mite. PAC is becoming more frequent that SAC, probably due to new peren- nial airborne allergens or irritants, such as pollutants. Traditional therapy for SAC and PAC has been topical administra- tion of antihistamines or mast cells stabilizers. In the last few years therapeutic approach has evolved toward more specific therapies (allergen immunotherapy, topical immunosuppressants) improving its management, G.B.

DIAGNOSIS Diagnostic criteria were estab- lished in 2011 by the EOM study group. The major diagnostic crite- rion is otitis media with effusion eosin- ophil-dominant effusion. The mi- nor criteria are: 1) highly viscous MEE; 2) resistance to convention- al treatment for otitis media; 3) association with asthma; and 4) association with nasal polyposis (NP). Definite cases are defined as the presence of the major cri- terion plus two or more of the minor criteria. In addition eosin- ophilic granulomatous polyangitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome) and hy- pereosinophilic syndrome need to be excluded. CLINICAL FEATURES EOM can be roughly divided into effusion type otitis media and chronic type otitis media. The lat- ter is further divided into two sub- types: simple perforation subtype and granulation tissue formation subtype (Figure 2). About 90 % of EOM patients have asthma. As- sociation of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) was also found in 75% of the patients (2). In these patients, massive infiltration of eosinophils is observed in NP or in the sinus mucosa. This condition is called eosinophil-dominant NP or eosin- ophilic CRS. EOM causes deterioration of bone conduction hearing levels, particularly for high frequencies. The risk factors of deteriorating bone conduction hearing levels include high levels of IgE and eo- sinophil cationic protein in MEE, male sex, the duration of EOM, the severity of middle ear mucosa inflammation, and the presence of bacterial infection. TREATMENT Currently, the most reliable treat- ment for EOM is systemic and topical administration of corticos- teroids. The instillation of triamci- nolone acetonide into the middle ear is very effective for the control of eosinophilic inflammation.In addition, omalizumab, a recom- binant humanized monoclonal an- ti-IgE antibody, has been reported to be efficacious for some patients with EOM. The control of bacterial infection is also important for the treatment for EOM superinfected with path- ogens. KEY REFERENCES R, Iino Intracta- ble Mogi G, Honjo I, Ishii editors.

Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic immune and antigen me- diated disease (Figure 1), which is characterized by eosinophil in- filtration into the esophageal epi- thelium and results in esophageal fibrosis and dysfunction. EoE af- fects children and adults through- out the world, and has been reported in all continents. The prevalence of EoE is 56.7/100,000 and is increasing throughout the world.

Patients with EoE often have a history of atopy, such as elevated serum IgE, peripheral eosinophilia, allergic diseases (including asth- ma, atopic dermatitis, or allergic rhinitis, IgE mediated foods gies), and sensitization to foods and aeroallergens as demonstrat- ed by a positive skin test result. Allergic rhinitis (AR) was seen up to 75% of the patients. Evidence suggests that aeroaller- gens may play a causative role in the development of EoE. Circum- stantial evidence shows an in- crease in EoE diagnosis in pollen seasons. During pollen season, there is an increased numbers of eosinophils in esophagus com- pared to non-atopic controls, al-though the number of eosinophils observed was lower than values typically seen in patients who have EoE. In addition, we have seasonal variation of symptoms and eosinophils in esophagus in about 25% of our patients. Sea- sonal variation was confirmed in a case report on one 20 year old, full disease control was achieved only during non-pollen seasons.

Thus the nose has an im- portant role as gatekeeper pro- tecting the lower airways from exogenous pro-inflammatory trig- gers. The nose and bronchi form one respiratory unit (Figure 1). Anatomically there are both simi- larities and differences. The nose is being formed by the ectoderm, while the lower airways derive from the mesoderm, with the paranasal sinuses representing a mix of these two. Thus the nose keep some features from the skin being more resistant to external stress compared to mucosa of the lower airways. One common fea- ture of the facial skin and the nose and the lung is the innervation. THE NERVOUS LINK Both the face and the nose are sensitive to external stimuli po - tentially harmful for the lower air - ways. Koskela described in a study on cold air sensitive asthmatics that facial cooling was enough to induce a bronchial obstruction in subjects inhaling humidified room tempered air. The magnitude of response was the same as when the subjects inhaled cool dry air to the lower airways.. However, not only the face but also the nose THE UNITED AIRWAY DISEASE 4 KEY MESSAGESLeif Bjermer Lund University Lund, Sweden share the same pattern with ef - ferent sensory nerves mediating a response in the lower airways. In a study by Millqvist, cold air stimuli in the nose induced increased re - sistance of the lower airways. This naso-bronchial reflex could be sup - pressed by local anesthesia applied in the nose. A third evidence of a nervous link between the upper and lower airways was the study by LIttell showing that methacho - line but not histamine applied in the nose, increased both nasal and lower airway resistance. THE DIRECT AIRWAY LINK During inspiration the air is fil - tered, tempered, humidified and supplied with nitric oxide (NO) before entering the lower airways. Thus the nose serve as an impor - tant conditioner of the air that is tracked down into the airways. Nose breathing can prevent bron - choconstriction induced by inhala - tion of cold dry air, and increased mouth breathing due to a blocked nose is likely to be one reason for the worsening of asthma. In nor - mal controls almost all NO found in exhaled air is derived from the upper airways, mainly produced in the paranasal sinuses. During deep nasal inhalation, NO in physiologi - cal concentrations is being tracked down to the lower airways. This is believed to be an important factor that helps to improve matching be - tween ventilation and perfusion. A SYSTEMIC LINK Allergen challenge in the nose is know to induce inflammatory changes in the bronchi, measured as increased numbers of eosino - phils in bronchial mucosa. The final proof that the reaction was due to The united airway disease134GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION C - Allergic rhinitis - clinical features and co-morbiditiessystemic mechanisms came from the revert study applying allergens by endoscopy in the lower airways, and than 24 hours later, showing increased inflammation in the na - sal mucosa. The link between the paranasal sinuses and the lower airways is probably even more in - teresting. Sharing the same germ layer origin, there are similarities not only regarding cellular inflam - mation but also in tissue inflam - mation and remodelling. chronic sinusitis harboring fungal or staph - ylococcal superantigens has been associated with a more extensive and difficult to treat asthma. Also in other non-asthmatic conditions, a definite link exist, i.e. chronic lower airway infection with bron - chiectasis is associated with an increased prevalence of chronic sinusitis with polyps. IMPLICATION FOR TREATMENT The link between the upper and the lower airways is so obvious that it should be regarded as mis- conduct not to consider both com- partments as treatment targets in order to achieve optimal disease control. Thus patients with asth- ma and more severe rhinitis or rhinosinusitis have a greater risk of worsening asthma control and getting severe asthma exacerba- tions. In parallel, severe asthma barely exists without concomitant rhinosinusitis. In the traditional asthma studies, severe rhinitis pa- tients have been excluded. There- fore, we need to explore different treatment alternatives, how to best treat and control asthma and rhinitis simultaneously. This can be done either as optimal local treatment by the two compart- ments or by the systemic route. As new biologics with anti-cytokine treatment are entering the scene, it is important that these aspects are being addressed from the ear- ly start.KEY REFERENCES 1. Koskela H, Tukiainen H.

Interestingly, while the issue of comorbidity between AD and AA has been analyzed thoroughly from a genetic, epi- demiological and clinical aspect, data related to the comorbidity between AD and AR are more scarce. In principle, this could be mainly due to the fact that the age of onset of both diseases differs substantially. Indeed in our clas- sical view, AD starts rather early in childhood and typically much longer before AR and AA emerge. However, epidemiological studies seem to show that the combina- tion of AD and AR is a risk factor for AA. Moreover, the issue of the severity of AD and its possible im- plication for the appearance of AR has not been studied in detail. In some epidemiological stud- ies looking at the prevalence of AD, AA and AR, the percentage of subjects with both AD and AR was about 9%. Interestingly, this prevalence of comorbidity de- creased afterwards with age. The BAMSE cohort reported a high- er incidence: at 12 years, 58% of the children had eczema, asthma ATOPIC DERMATITIS AND ALLERGIC RHINITIS: WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE FOR COMORBIDITY? 5 KEY MESSAGESThomas Bieber University of Bonn Germany and/or rhinitis (Figure 1) at some time. Disease turnover was high for all three diseases throughout the study (Figure 2). Comorbid- ity increased with age, and at 12 years, 7.5% of all the children were affected by at least two al- lergy-related diseases. This fur- ther illustrates how important it is to consider the age of the pa- tients and disease turnover with regard to this particular kind of as- sociation. It is well accepted that patients with AD are significantly more likely to have other atopic diseases, compared to patients without AD (22% versus 17%). In such studies, which are not primarily considering the age of the patients, the comorbidity be- tween AD and AR was quite high (76 %). In other studies a higher percentage of patients with AD had reported to have rhinitis but again these studies did not con-sider differences in terms of age of the patients. Interestingly from a genetic point of view, there is no evidence for a clear overlap in terms of genetic linkage analyses or by the means of other genet- ic investigations such as genome wide association studies. Moreover there are no clear-cut validated biomarkers identified so far which may predict, that a given patients with AD will develop AR in the course of the natural histo - ry of its skin disease. On the oth- er hand, it has been reported that individuals with AD clearly show a predisposition for allergic comor- bidities by the age of 3y and that this seems to correlate with the severity and poor disease control of AD. This is again confirmed by more re - cent studies looking at the severity of AD in relationship with other Atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis: where is the evidence for comorbidity?136GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION C - Allergic rhinitis - clinical features and co-morbiditieschronic health disorders including AA, AR and food allergies. Hence addressing the question of comor - bidity of AD and AR seems to be tightly related to the time point at which the patients are observed during the course of AD. Indeed, beside the real comorbidity, se - quential association between AD and AR is probably the more often situation than the single occur - rence of both allergic diseases. The lessons learned from these observations as 3 fold: 1. The heterogeneity of the clin- ical phenotype of AD has so far been underestimated. New epidemiological studies with regard to the question of the comorbidity should consider this particular aspect.2. In terms of prevention, there are currently new develop- ments aimed to prevent the appearance of AD as the first manifestation of the atopic march by a very early interven- tion using emollients directly after birth. Only a few studies have addressed this key issue so far and it will be interesting to see whether a successful prevention of AD in the context of this early intervention may also prevent the appearance of AR in children with high risk to develop the atopic march. 3. From a therapeutic point of view it is well accepted that - in contrast to AR -antihista- mines have only poor effects in the control of AD, particu-larly with regards to the pruri- tus. On the other hand, there is some evidence that allergen immunotherapy (AIT) targeting for example house dust mite as a classical trigger for AR could be of interest in the context of the management of the severe forms of AD. Clearly, for such studies we needed to explore the clinical benefit but also the immunological mechanisms pu- tatively involved in a positive clinical respond for both AD and AR to AIT.

This sy n- drome is called pollen-food syndrome or oral allergy syndro me. It is characterized by an IgE-mediated, immediate reaction i n- duced by prior sensitization to pollen rather than primary se nsi- tization to a food allergen. Cross-reactivity depends on specifi c epitopes shared by food allergens and pollen Pathogenesis-related proteins (PR) are usually responsi ble for these reactions. 17 families of PR have been identified according to t heir function. The most relevant to pollen food allergy syndrom e are -reacts commonly with foods o f the Rosacee family i.e for fruit: apple, pear, peach, cherry, apri - cot. Bet v 1 shows homologous protein with Mal d 1, a major antigenic protein in apple The clinical manifestations are usually mild and transient (pru- ritus of the lip, tongue and mouth, throat tightness). Syste mic reactions are uncommon, but may happen depending on the specific epitope that is involved Symptoms are triggered by fresh vegetables and fruits. The cooked forms are usually tolerated The prevalence is related to sensitivity patterns varying with exposure and is associated to geographical areas i.e Northe an overlooked co-morbidity of allergic rhinitis (AR), however the upper respirato - ry tract can be a target of IgE-me - diated food allergy. Symptoms may include nasal congestion, rhi - norrhoea, sneezing and pruritus. Although prevalence seems to be low in clinical presentation, pa - tients who present with IgE-medi - ated food allergy have nasal symp - toms during oral food challenges. A peculiar form of co-morbid food allergy, highly prevalent in patients with pollen-induced AR, is the so called \"pollen food syndrome\" (PFS), which is also termed \"oral allergy syndrome\" (OAS). This is an immediate hypersensitivity re - action mediated by IgE following sensitization to pollens. Patients will experience local oral symp - toms of pruritus and swelling with fresh fruits (e.g. apple, pear, peach), vegetables or spices that cross-re - act with pollens (Figure 1 and Table 1). The suggested mechanism is IgE cross-reactivity between the impli - cated plant-derived food and the primary sensitizing pollen(s) that occurs as consequence of common epitopes between pollen and food allergens. The pathogen-related proteins (PR) are the plant allergens re-ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND FOOD ALLERGY 6 KEY MESSAGESAntonella Muraro University Hospital of Padua Italy sponsible for this peculiar form of food allergy. Some of them are heat-resistant and account for some more severe reactions. Two main families of heat-labile PR have been identified as more prevalent in inducing clinical reac- tions: the Bet v 1 family (birch pol- len major allergens that are highly cross reactive with several plant food allergens) and the profilins (which includes the Bet v 2 minor Allergic rhinitis and food allergy139GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION C - Allergic rhinitis - clinical features and co-morbidities Figure 1 Cross-reactive pollens and foods Allergic rhinitis and food allergy140GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION C - Allergic rhinitis - clinical features and co-morbiditiesbirch pollen allergen, also highly cross reactive with other pollen and plant derived food allergens). The prevalence and pattern of the triggering food can vary widely in relation to the specific region- al pattern of sensitization. Oral symptoms related to birch pol- len are more prevalent in North- ern and Central Europe, while in Southern Europe grass pollen is the usual trigger. Diagnosis (Figure 2) relies on a history of pruritus at the lip and tongue, sometimes with oral and facial angioedema and throat tightness following the ingestion of fruit and vegetable. Skin prick testing with the raw fruit and veg- etable is more accountable than using commercial extract, as the allergens are usually labile and are easily destroyed by cooking. The use of component-resolved-di- agnostics has recently allowed to better profile the sensitizations of these patients and to add some probabilistic information on the severity of the reactions. The only treatment is avoidance of the triggering food; the role of inhal- ant allergen immunotherapy as treatment of the clinical reactions to related foods is still debated.

Studies are required to look for evidence of subclinical rhinitis in severely affected chronic urticaria patientsThe cutaneous mast cell is con- sidered to be the primary effector cell in urticaria and histamine to be the major mediator, although there is clinical and histological evidence that other inflammatory events are important. Histamine is also considered to be a key me- diator of allergic rhinitis (AR). Un- like chronic urticaria (CU), where IgE-mediated allergy is rarely the cause, a high proportion of AR pa- tients are allergic to inhalant aller- gens and will develop symptoms on exposure. It might be anticipated that CU patients would have features of generalized mast cell degranula- tion if the autoimmune hypothesis of causation is correct. Although patients with severe urticaria may complain of non-specific fatigue, arthralgia and indigestion due to mediator release into the circula- tion, it is exceptional for patients to experience respiratory or gas- trointestinal symptoms during at- tacks. A possible explanation for this is the need for co-stimulation of cutaneous mast cells by C5a at the time of activation by function- al autoantibodes against IgE or its receptor. By contrast, resident mast cells of the respiratory tract do not express the C5a receptor THE LINK BETWEEN THE SKIN AND THE AIRWAYS 7 KEY MESSAGESClive E.H.

This is in contrast to acute urticaria, which may be caused by immediate hypersensi- tivity reactions to food or drug al- lergens with a risk of progression to anaphylaxis. Symptoms result from generalized mast cell degran- ulation, including local release of histamine and other mediators in the respiratory tract leading to rhinitis and/or asthma. There is some evidence for bron- chial hyperreactivity in different subtypes of CU although overt asthma is rare. One study con- cluded that bronchial hyperres-ponsiveness is a common feature in patients with active CU.

Thus every physician caring for patients with diseases in the oro-pharyngeal area should be familiar with a basic knowledge on the management of angioede - ma. There are 2 different forms of angioedema based on different mediators and partly also clinical features: Histamine- mediated forms and non-histamine, brady - kinin-mediated diseases (Figure 1). HISTAMINE-AND OTHER MAST CELL MEDIATOR MEDIATED FORMS OF ANGIOEDEMA Histamine-mediated forms are mostly associated with urticar- ial, itch and/or systemic allergic symptoms such as asthma or an- aphylactic shock; untreated they lasts often mostly for a few hours before spontaneously resolving.

In a population-based sample (n=4927), participants who often or almost always experi - enced nighttime symptoms of rhi - nitis were significantly more likely to report habitual snoring, chronic excessive sleepiness, or nonrestor - ative sleep than those who rarely or never had symptoms.

This leads to a poor sleep quality and daytime somno- lence. In contrast to these symp- toms, patients with OSAS present with habitual snoring, choking and stops of breathing (apneas) during sleep. In addition, patients with Fulvio Braido University of Genoa Genoa, ItalyHans-Werner Allergic rhinitis sleep apnea147GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION C - Allergic rhinitis - clinical features and co-morbidities suffer from chronic exces- sive sleepiness and nonrestora- tive sleep. In most cases, talking with the patient`s partner can help differentiating the underlying diseases. OSAS can effectively be diagnosed by polysomnography in a sleep lab. A non-laboratory monitoring of sleep by cardiores- piratory polygraphy can render first information about nocturnal breathing in patients suspected to suffer from OSAS. NASAL RESISTANCE AND CPAP THERAPY CPAP (Figure 1) is, the most ef- fective treatment for OSAS. with a compliance of ap- proximately 60%. Nasal conges- tion, irritation or runny nose can be caused by the use of CPAP but, when concomitant rhinitis is pres- ent, its symptoms may intereferes with CPAP adherence. Symptoms can be often alleviated by the use of a humidifier but a proper treat- ment of concomitant allergies, chronic sinus problems or a devi- ated septum must be considered. KEY REFERENCES 1.

Some symptoms of allergic rhinitis (nasal drainage, nasal congestion, sneezing, and nasal itching) associ- ated with non-allergic rhinitis, rhi- nosinusitis, (Table 1) or with other disorders that may involve the nose and sinuses. (Table 2). By history, allergic rhinitis (AR) is more likely than non-allergic rhinitis if there are nasal itch- ing and sneezing, associated eye symptoms (itchy, watery eyes), and nasal symptoms that devel- op or worsen with exposure to furry pets or seasonally in asso- ciation with regional allergy pol- len seasons (Table 1). Year round symptoms make it more difficult to distinguish AR from non-AR, or even chronic rhinosinusitis, on the basis of history alone. Al- lergy testing then is needed for a correct diagnosis. However, the mere presence of sensitisation as identified by skin testing or blood testing is not sufficient and must be correlated with the clinical his- tory. Unilateral nasal symptoms ALLERGIC RHINITIS DIAGNOSTIC WORK-UP OVERVIEW 1 KEY MESSAGES suggest that an anatomic issue is present (Table 2). Physical examination of the nose should be performed, in part to identify complicating or alternative nasal conditions (e.g, nasal polyps, septal deviation). In AR, inflamed mucosa classically has a bluish/ pale hue, but appearance may vary and may not reliably differentiate between AR and non-AR. Rhinosinusitis (including nasal polyps) is characterized by two or more symptoms, one of which should be either a) nasal block- age/ obstruction/congestion or b) nasal discharge (anterior/posterior nasal drip). Other symptoms may be c) facial pain/pressure, and/or d) reduction or loss of smell. Dis-colored nasal drainage may occur in AR and some types of non-AR, so its presence does not necessar- ily indicate bacterial rhinosinusitis. The common cold from respirato- ry viruses has an acute onset of rhinosinusitis symptoms typically lasting for less than 10 days or getting better after 5 days. The common cold and rhinosinusitis are not typically associated with nasal itching or ocular symptoms that may be seen in AR. KEY REFERENCES 1.

The advances primarily relate to the development of ritig and flexible endoscopes. Traditional approaches of using a nasal speculum and a light source or an otoscope, referred to as rhi - noscopy, investigate the anterior part of the nose prior to the level of the middle turbinates. Although the experienced examiner might be able to visualize the middle turbi - nate with this technique, the view is limited. The anterior part of the nose contains the nasal vestibule, where the epithelium transitions from squamous to pseudostrati - fied columnar ciliated. One can also easily visualize the anterior septum, inferior turbinates, and nasal valve. The nasal valve is formed by the junction between the anterior na - sal septum medially and the most caudal margin of the upper lateral cartilage of the nose superiorly and laterally. This valve is the narrow - est portion of the airway between the external environment and the alveoli. Deflections of the anterior septum have a marked impact on airflow and can be diagnosed by anterior rhinoscopy.DIAGNOSIS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS - RHINOSCOPY AND ENDOSCOPY 2 KEY MESSAGES Other salient findings that can be visualized by rhinoscopy are hyper - trophia (Figure 1) or congestion of the inferior turbinates. Most sep - tal perforations involve this area. Large nasal polyps (NP) can also be seen, but novice clinicians of - ten mistake the anterior tip of the middle turbinate or a large inferior turbinate for a polyp. Eighty-five percent of nose bleeds occur in the anterior septum in the area that is the confluence of the anterior ethmoid artery, the facial artery, and the septal artery, which form a rich plexus of vessels, called the Keisselbach's plexus. There are no definitive signs of al- lergic rhinitis (AR) on anterior rhi- noscopy; however, visualization by rhinoscopy helps to rule out other causes of similar symptoms such as nasal congestion due to anatomic causes.Although anterior rhinoscopy is helpful, it does not provide visu- alization of the entire nasal cavity. Specifically it does not provide a good view of the middle meatus, where the sinuses (which are com- monly involved in patients with AR) drain. Adenoid hypertrophy, NP, tumors, posterior epistaxis, septal deviations obstructing the sinus ostia, and sinus infections are common and form part of the differential diagnosis of rhinop- athy. Nasal endoscopy provides not only visualization to enhance diagnostic abilities (Figures 2, 3 and 4), but also the opportunity to work inside the nose under direct visualization. Nasal endoscopy can be per- formed with a rigid or a flexible endoscope. Both can be attached to cameras for educating observ- ers and patients and documenting Diagnosis of allergic rhinitis - rhinoscopy and endoscopyRobert Naclerio Fuad Baroody University of Chicago Chicago, USA154GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION D - Allergic rhinitis - diagnosis the examination. Both examina- tions are usually performed after the administration of a topical decongestant and anesthetic. The response to the nasal decongest- ant sometimes provides clues to the underlying problem. Patients with AR often decongest well with oxymetazoline because the con- gestion of the inferior turbinates is caused by inflammatory medi- ators released during an allergic reaction that subsequently dilate the cavernous veins in the inferior turbinates. Flexible endoscopy is easier to perform and can also be used for visualizing the nasopharynx and larynx. Rigid endoscopy provides better image definition, and the endoscope can be held with one hand, freeing the other hand to intervene in the nasal cavity. Such interventions include lysis of ad- hesions, obtaining guided cultures (Figure 5), performing biopsies, and cauterizing nosebleeds. Di- rected middle meatal cultures cor- relate highly with maxillary sinus Figure 1 Left panel: Endoscopic view of an antrochoanal polyp (originating from the maxillary sinus and protruding into the nasal cavity) of the right nostril in a teenage male who presented with a unilateral nasal obstruction.

When should nasal endoscopy be performed in a patient who has a nasal complaint? One could argue that it should be done in every-one, but that would be too cost- ly. A more reasonable approach is to perform endoscopy in subjects who have symptoms that are not explained by rhinoscopy and who did not respond to initial treat- ment.Figure 5 View of the right middle turbinate (#) and the right osteomeatal unit (arrowhead) with some purulent drainage.

The late-phase reaction involves an eosinophilic infiltrate, leading to nasal inflammation. Nasal nitric oxide (nNO) is pro- duced continuously in the parana- sal sinuses without inflammatory stimuli and plays a role in airway homeostasis. AR may be associ- ated with elevated nNO levels, by the increase in inducible nitric ox- ide synthase (iNOS) expression in respiratory epithelial cells. While the level of nNO may be increased by nasal inflammation, nasal swell- ing and secretions may occlude the ostia of the paranasal sinuses thereby lowering nNO levels. A high nNO may be a useful mark- er of eosinophilic inflammation of the nasal cavity and indicate open sinus ostia. nNO measurements may be an alternative to diagnose AR in patients who are not able to undergo allergic tests or invasive procedures. Infiltrating eosinophils are the hallmark of nasal inflammation in AR. Nasal smears for eosinophils are not recommended for rou- tine use in diagnosing AR when NON-INVASIVE EVALUATION OF NASAL INFLAMMATION (NO, NASAL CYTOLOGY AND MEDIATORS) 3 KEY MESSAGES the diagnosis is clearly supported, but may be a useful adjunct when there remains a high clinical sus- picion of allergy in a history-pos- itive, skin test-negative patient. Nasal cytology can not only be utilized to establish the diagno- sis of AR, but is also useful in the follow-up of treated patients with this condition. The technique al- lows clinicians to detect the cel- lular modifications of the nasal epithelium during allergen expo- sure (Figure 1) and by subsequent treatment with corticosteroids. Many different mediators, cy- tokines, and chemokines have been (Figure 2). Certain proin- eosinophilic major basic protein and been identified in allergic mucin. Eosin- ophil cationic protein (ECP) is one of the most studied inflammatory markers and is considered a gen- eral marker of mucosal inflamma- tion, both in processes of eosin- ophil and neutrophil activation. Another key feature of mucosal inflammation is the exudation of plasma proteins such as albumin, a2-macroglobulin, and others, which can be monitored by analy- sis of plasma proteins in NL.

The more sensitive intradermal tests are recommended after negative SPT in some situations, but can lead to false positive reactions and are associated with a higher risk of systemic sid e effectsSkin testing is well established in the diagnostic work-up of aller- gic rhinitis (AR) to demonstrate IgE mediated sensitizations. It is mainly performed with protein al- lergens and only rarely with small molecules. A positive skin test usually indicates sensitization but not necessarily clinically relevant allergy. The latter has to be proven either by a very convincing history or with further steps in the algo- rithm of in vivo diagnosis (i.e. nasal challenge tests). SKIN PRICK TEST The skin prick test (SPT) is the best established skin test and rec- ommended as first diagnostic test in patients with AR. SPT can be performed in patients of any age although the reactivity may pos- sibly be lower in the elderly. The quality of allergen extracts used for SPT is critical. False negative results can occur if minor allergens or instable allergenic proteins are underrepresented in an extract. However, well-standardized al- lergen extracts are available for many inhalant allergens. EU leg- islation makes it currently difficult to have new and optimized diag- nostic products approved due to very high standard requirements.SKIN TESTING IN THE DIAGNOSTIC WORKUP OF RHINITIS 4 KEY MESSAGES The major advantage of SPT as compared to an in vitro measure- ment of specific IgE antibodies is the fact that the test can be inter- preted within 15 to 20 minutes (Figure 1). A further advantage is that the test gives a visual in- dication of the sensitivity to the patient which may have impact on the patient's behavior. Usual- ly prick tests are performed with panels of allergens of interest; a standard set is proposed for inhal- ant allergens (Table 1). Some studies show discordances between serum-specific IgE and SPT results. In a recent meta-anal- ysis on studies with SPT with in-halant allergens, every fourth sen- sitized patient would have been misdiagnosed as non-sensitized for a particular allergen if only serum specific IgE testing had been done. This has leads to the suggestion that the two methods complement each other and can- not be used interchangeably. OTHER SKIN TESTS Intradermal tests are recom- mended after negative SPT in some clinical situations. They are considered to be more sensitive than the SPT but can lead to false positive reactions and they are as- sociated with a higher risk of sys- Skin testing in the diagnostic workup of rhinitisThomas Werfel Hannover Medical School Hannover, Germany159GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION D - Allergic rhinitis - diagnosis temic side effects. Therefore ex- tracts utilized for intradermal skin testing are less concentrated than those utilized for SPT.

Out- comes include symptom scores, measures of nasal airway patency, cellular influx and inflammatory mediators in nasal fluid. Applications of provocation tests are outlined in Table 1. In clinical practice, provocations may help differentiate between sensitisa- tion and allergy, and identify indi- viduals with local allergic rhinitis (AR). In research settings, prov- ocations have demonstrated the efficacy of pharmacotherapies including tranasal corticosteroids, and immunological neural mechanisms. reproducible means of delivering allergen to the nasal mucosa is required. Various deliv- ery systems used are outlined in Table 2, alongside different provo- cation protocols. The latter include up-dosing/titration provocations, providing dose-response profiles and allowing tailoring of future doses to each individual. Repeat challenges, usually every 24 hours PROVOCATION TESTS 5 KEY MESSAGES for several days, may provide an approximation to real-life allergen exposures and allow investigation of 'priming' of the mucosa. For research, participants are se- lected on the basis of typical al- lergic symptoms and evidence of systemic sensitisation to the aller- gen in question. Allergen provoca- tions are usually performed out- side of usual seasonal exposure and in the absence of symptoms induced by alternative/perennial allergens, infection, nasal polyps or structural pathologies. Whilst provocations are extremely safe, individuals with poorly controlled asthma or FEV1 <70% predicted should be excluded; other con- traindications include pregnancy or a history of anaphylaxis to the allergen in question. Anti-allergic medications need to be stopped for a sufficient wash-out period prior to provocations. Clinical and laboratory outcomes of nasal provocations are given in Table 3. Typically, provocation is preceded by nasal lavage to pro- vide a clean baseline. An example of the time-course of symptom and peak nasal inspiratory flow re- sponses to a single dose nasal al- lergen challenge is given in Figure 1.

Its incidence is rising in parallel with other IgE-mediated diseas- es, affecting 10 to 30% of adults and up to 40% of children in in- dustrialised countries. Seasonal AR is mainly elicited by exposure to pollens during the pollination period, while perennial AR is elic- ited by allergens present in the environment throughout the year like those from house dust mite allergens or fungal spores. The disease is often associated with other IgE-mediated diseases like allergic asthma, or atopic derma- titis. The characteristic symptoms of AR are excess nasal secretion, itching, sneezing, nasal conges- tion and obstruction associated with eosinophilic inflammation of the mucosa. To confirm the diag- nosis of AR, sensitisation (specific IgE reactivity) needs to be record- ed and should be concordant with the clinical history. The prototype for the in vitro detection of serum IgE (the radi- oallergosorbent test, RAST) first described in 1967 used a paper SPECIFIC I gE AND DIAGNOSIS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS 6 KEY MESSAGES disc as a solid phase to covalently immobilize the allergen followed by the addition of patient's After different washing proce- dures to remove unbound serum proteins and was detected with 125I-la- belled polyclonal anti-human IgE (Figure 1). Modern assays for the detection of allergen-specific IgE have undergone impressive im- provements including the calibra- tion against the WHO Standard 72/502, allowing quantitative de- terminations, and the implemen- tation of fully automated devices (Figure 2). To date the most com- monly used system to determine allergen-specific IgE is the Immu-noCAP system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Uppsala) considered as the \"gold standard\" for the in vit- ro diagnosis of allergic conditions. More recently, novel diagnostic tests based on allergen microar- rays have been introduced both in research and clinical practice. Multiplex-based in vitro tools for allergy diagnosis allow a compo- nent resolved diagnostics of the atopy status of a patient in a cost effective way. In vitro tests for allergen-specific serum IgE are excellent for iden- tifying a sensitization state of a patient and can be recommended at any age and without wash-out for antiallergic medication. How- Specific IgE and diagnosis of allergic rhinitisReto Crameri Swiss Institute of Allergy and Asthma Research Davos, Switzerland164GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION D - Allergic rhinitis - diagnosis ever, a positive in vitro test for al- lergen-specific IgE in serum does not always equate with clinical allergy, and a negative test does not completely exclude the dis- ease. For a clinical manifestation of any allergy the only biological- ly relevant allergen-specific IgE is those immobilized on the surface of effector cells through the high affinity Fc RI receptors. This can, through cross-linking of the IgE molecules after allergen exposure and the resulting mediator release from effector cells, elic- it local symptoms of AR also in the absence of sol- uble allergen-specific IgE in serum. Therefore, the best tool for the diagno- sis of AR is by correlating the patient's history and physical exam with the presence of aeroallergen specific IgE determined by skin testing or by in vitro assays. Like skin test- ing, limitations of in vitro specific IgE measurement include the availability of fully standardized aller- genic extracts, particularly for foods, drugs, and occu- pational agents. New perspectives for the diagnosis of AR have been opened by in vitro diagnostic tests based on molecular approach- es, which allow a component resolved diagnosis of hundreds of the offending allergens. Multi- plex measurement platforms like the Immuno-Solid phase Allergen (ISAC) allows discrimination between genuine and cross-reac- tive sensitization thereby reducing unnecessary allergen challenges, and facilitating the identification of patients with a good prognosis for a successful allergen immuno- therapy.

Ad hoc Diagnostic Algorithms have been proposedThe number of allergenic mol- ecules cloned and available for diagnostic tests grows year after year. We can nowadays precisely define the patient's IgE repertoire and distinguish, in polysensitized patients, true sensitization (IgE to major, \"species-specific\" allergen- ic molecules) from apparent sen- sitization, due to cross-reactive molecules (e.g. profilin, serum al- bumin, tropomyosin, CCD) shared by many allergenic This molecular approach, also called 'component-resolved diag- nosis' 'multi- plex' methods. By the singleplex method, single molecules are sep- arately analyzed and the operator can select, with an inductive ap- proach, those to be tested in the individual patient.

Indeed, the IgE response against grass pollen (e.g. Phleum pratense ) usually evolves from a simple, monomolecular stage to an oli- gomolecular stage and eventually to a polymolecular sensitization stage. This phenomenon has been defined as 'molecular spreading', that is, \"The sequential develop- ment of antibody (IgE) response to distinct non-cross-reacting mole- cules from the same antigenic with an \"initiator\" (allergenic) molecule.\" Phl p 1 is the probable 'initiator' molecule in most patients, and the response involves then Phl p 4 or Phl p 5, thereafter also Phl p 2 and Phl p 11 and at a later stage Phl p 12 or Phl p 7 (Figure 1). Inter- estingly, the molecular spreading process follows different sequenc- es in different children: some pa- tients remain sensitized only to the \"initiator\" molecule while a few patients become sensitized to most or all allergenic molecules.

A consistent proportion of pollen allergic patients are sensitized to profilin and other highly cross-re- acting molecules.

Not surpris- ingly, a precise molecular diagno- sis can play a strong influence on AIT prescription in Mediterranean countries (Figure 3) and this might imply a better AIT efficacy and cost-effectiveness. Accordingly, new diagnostic algorithms for an improved prescription of AIT in patients with pollen-related al- lergic rhinitis have been recently proposed (Figure 4). KEY REFERENCES 1. Valenta R.

Effector cell based in vitro tests might help in defining the allergic state in sensitized individ- uals. The most common cellular test is basophil activation by allergen (BAT). BAT evaluating histamine, sulfidoleukotriene and cytokine release upon allergen exposure has been used in the diagnosis of allergy for many years (Figure 1). However, the measurement of allergen-induced histamine re- lease from patient's basophils can not be used widely, because it is expensive and time consuming. In recent years, flowcytometric analysis based on the detection of allergen-induced basophil surface markers has been used (Figure 2). CD63 expression or CD203c DIAGNOSIS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS - CELLULAR TESTS 8 KEY MESSAGES upregulation on basophil surface have been reported as new diag- nostic markers for allergic diseas- es (Figure 3). In several studies the BAT based on the occurence of CD63 (gp53) in the presence of allergen was found sensitive (80-100%) and specific (100%) for the in vitro diagnosis of pollen al- lergy.

Several of these techniques will soon devel- op into the standard clinical tools. 'Omic' technologies and their in- tegration are referred as systems biology. These experiments differ from traditional studies, which are largely focused around a hy- pothesis. By contrast, the goal of an 'omic' experiment is to create an hypothesis-free, holistic view of the molecules involved in the functional and/or structural alter- ations within the cells and tissues. In such an experiment, all data are simultaneously acquired and ana- lyzed to further define a specific hypothesis for testing. Together with the progress in the primary cell culture techniques, combined with the molecular biology and cell imaging tools, 'omic' techniques are becoming crucial in under- standing etiology of the disease, screening, diagnosis and progno- sis (so-called biomarkers discov- ery) (Figure 2). Moreover, they are increasingly being used in drug discovery and assessment of their NEW DIAGNOSTIC AND RESEARCH TECHNIQUES IN ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS 9 KEY MESSAGES toxicity and efficacy. Most of these technologies are being developed into high-throughput and multi- plexed assays, which significantly lower the costs and decrease time to obtain the enormous amount of data. Because of that, in parallel with the 'omic' technology, there is a fast improvement in the data analysis and bioinformatic tools to comprehend and understand the results.Genomics was the first 'omic' tech- nologies to be developed, which progressed beyond DNA sequenc- ing (structural genomics) to identi- fying the function of the encod- ed genes (functional genomics). Genomics has been focused on detecting structural variations in the coding and non-coding parts of DNA such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in different tissues and their associations with Milena Sokolowska Cezmi A.

Genomics is currently frequently used in the studies, identifying DNA of micro- organisms that are inhibiting hu- man body, which are referred as microbiome. Nasal mucosa is one of the tissues in which interaction between the microbiome and the host might shape the mucosal barrier function and response to allergens and irritants. With the progress of the genomics a glob- al concept developed, suggest-ing that not only the DNA/gene structure, but the gene expression might reflect the functional state of the organisms. Transcriptomics is the study of the total mRNA, re- flecting the genes that are active- ly expressed at any given moment. Since viral infections of the nose are extremely popular, they might also modulate the AR and other diseases of the nose and connect- ed organs. Therefore, it is increas- ingly more common to identify viral strains invading the nasal mucosa by genomic and transcrip-tomic methods. Epigenetic chang- es reflecting the influence of the environment on the nasal mucosa and leading to the non-genetic changes of chromatin or DNA are also currently studied by means of 'omic' technologies. Chromatin changes, histone modifications are studied by DNAse-seq and ChIP-seq, while DNA methylation and non-coding RNA expression (miRNA, lncRNA, etc.) are stud- ied by sequencing.

The prevalence of grass pollen sensitizations has surpassed house dust mite sensitizations, and if sensitizations to birch and other pollen are added, allergy against pollen is clearly the number one al - lergic airway disease. It is therefore no surprise that monitoring pollen is the only voluntarily performed air quality monitoring in Europe, whereas air quality monitoring of PM10, carbon black, NO2 and O3 are governmental funded activities to reduce man-made pollution. Measuring pollen is a major en - deavor as many sites need to be monitored daily and manually, and no satisfactory automated pollen monitors are functionally availa - ble. Currently, a network of about 350 pollen monitoring stations is spread over Europe. Monitoring pollen is a good pre- dictor of allergy symptoms. How- ever, the human immune system does not react to the pollen but to substances released by pollen, the most important ones being the al- lergens. Most pollen release a ma- jor allergen like Bet v 1 from birch pollen or Ole e 1 from olive pollen. Monitoring airborne allergens in- stead of airborne pollen is tedious MEASURING ALLERGEN EXPOSURE 10 KEY MESSAGES and not frequently done. How- ever, in all cases reported pollen counts varied widely in their ma- jor allergen release per pollen i.e. in their allergen release potency. In Figure 1 the release of Ole e 1 from olive pollen in Portugal is displayed. At the end of the olive pollen season a low number of air- borne olive pollen was counted, but the major olive pollen allergen Ole e 1 was highest of the whole season. Thus pollen counts may underestimate allergen exposure. In Figure 2 a similar story is told for birch pollen: both airborne Bet v 1 and birch pollen were moni- tored. Expected was that the pol- len potency, i.e. the amount of Bet v 1 calculated per pollen, would be constant. Thus the curve for pol- len potency should be a straight line parallel to the x-axis. This was however seldom the case in Eu- rope and only during brief periods. In Figure 2A only the example of Munich in Germany is shown. Cal- culating the origin of the pollen revealed that pollen with a deviat- ing potency stemmed from differ- ent regions. In general however, already the same pollen from the same region vary up to 10-fold in their potency to release the major allergen (Figure 2B). Unpublished observations showed that the same holds true for grass pollen.

Nowadays expo- sure is determined by measuring the amount of house dust mite al- lergen Der p 1, Der p 2, Der f 1 and Der f 2 per surface area instead. We now can do the same for pollen. From the above exam- ples we can deduce that probably any al- lergen from natural sources has a variability in releasing major (and probably also minor) allergens. As most aller- gens are natural prod- ucts, we expect this to hold true for all aller- gens. Thus, measuring exposure by determin- ing the evoking factor on a molecular level (molecular aerobiology) should have advantag- es. Until that is estab- lished, the measuring of airborne whole pollen grains remains a good alternative. KEY REFERENCES 1.

The reason to introduce HRQOL instruments in clinical practice or in clinical research is that the personal burden of any illness, as perceived by the patient, cannot be fully assessed by traditional clinical symptoms and signs since they are correlating only moder- ately with patient perceptions and functional capabilities on a daily basis. The importance of HRQOL in allergic rhinitis (AR) is demon- strated by the fact that in the last years the term AR and quality of life appeared cited in Pubmed more than 1,500 times. Both generic and disease-specif- ic instruments have been used to evaluate the impact of AR and its treatment on patients' HRQOL. Such instruments are useful for assessing treatment efficacy in clinical trials, for measuring the burden of disease in epidemiologi- cal studies, or as monitoring tool in clinical practice. Both generic and disease specific tools are useful, but their properties must be kept in mind.

They are based on general health issues and include items on physical activity, physio- logic status, capability of self-care, level of pain/stress and social in- tegration. Generic instruments are also useful to compare cost-effica- cy interventions. Disease specific questionnaires (Table 2) are more sensitive to changes and focus on items related to the disease, without the possibility to allow comparison between diseases. In the 90\u00b4s, several authors, using generic questionnaires, demon- strated that AR has a significant impact on HRQOL in comparison with healthy subjects (Figure 1) 180GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION D - Allergic rhinitis - diagnosis Diagnosis of allergic rhinitis-measuring health-related quality of life Figure 2 QOL scores in adults with perennial allergic rhinitis and healthy control subjects.

Also in the 90\u00b4s the first questionnaires spe- cific for AR were developed. Any questionnaire of HRQOL measurement requires meeting some psychometric characteris- tics before it can be used in clin- ical practice. The validation of the questionnaires must evaluate its' feasibility (ease to use), reliabili- ty (internal consistency), validity (good correlation with symptoms related to the disease and with other questionnaires), the floor and ceiling effects (the propor- tion of patients with the worst and best possible scores), sensi- tivity to change (the size effect) and the minimal important dif- ference. Other characteristic that must keep into consideration is the cultural adaptation since each questionnaire must be adapted and validated for use in different cultures and/or countries and for different age groups of patients. HRQOL questionnaires in AR in- clude dimensions (or domains) related to the disease such as nasal and non-nasal symptoms, activities of daily life, practical problems, energy/vitality, envi- ronmental aspects, sleep prob- lems and mood. In general, they include around 25 to 30 domains, but some questionnaires have the so call \"short version\" including 12 to 15 domains (Table 3). KEY REFERENCES 1.

Bio - technology and the diagnosis of al - lergic rhinitis (AR) are closely linked via the most prominent clinical pa - rameter in AR, specific IgE (sIgE) Specific IgE and thus the allergen sensitization profile of the patient is the key parameter for the diag - nosis of AR and allergic diseases in general. The first read-out in daily practice is a positive skin-prick test for aeroallergens, followed by in depth determination of the sen - sitization pattern in terms of sIgE in serum, locally in nasal biopsies, or bound on effector cells. A high sensitivity, specificity, reproduci - bility and thus a high reliability of diagnostic tests for sIgE depends on the identification and availabili - ty of the relevant allergens.

These already constitutes by definition biotech- nological processes. The main pit- falls here encompasses the notori- ous difficulties in standardization of extracts and the possible under representation of important aller- genic molecules in them, which might lead to false positive and negative results, thus hampering proper diagnosis of AR. The incredible progress expe - rienced by biotechnology over the last decades has significantly contributed to overcome some of these problems. First of all, bi -otechnological processes such as phage surface display of comple - mentary DNA libraries, selections by yeast two hybrid systems or the use of proteomics tools together with bioinformatics and databas - es have significantly improved the identification of relevant aller - gens (Figure 1). These identified molecules, usually proteins, are generated and/or modified using molecular biology techniques like polymerase-chain reaction (PCR), site directed mutagenesis or de novo gene synthesis and used to clone and express large amounts Oscar Palomares Complutense University of Madrid SpainClaudio Rhyner Swiss Institute of Allergy and Asthma Research, Davos, Switzerland183GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION D - Allergic rhinitis - diagnosis of allergens in heterologous hosts and to purify them to homogeneity using chromatographic and/or oth - er biochemical methods and tech - niques. Alternatively, if these al - lergens are contained in sufficient amount, they can also be directly purified to homogeneity from the allergenic source (Figure 2). The endpoint of this process is the availability of well characterized di - agnostic agents fulfilling the needs of clinical practice to diagnose and distinguish AR from NAR, as well as the relevant regulations for the diagnostic industry (e.g ISO 13485, 23640). The use of purified natural and recombinant allergens for the diagnosis of AR has established the new allergen-based concept of component resolved diagnosis (CRD). The CRD together with the other above described advances in biotechnology has certainly con - tributed to improve the diagnosis of AR, for example, with the iden - tification of patients with local al - lergic rhinitis suffering from local nasal allergic responses without systemic atopy.

Recent progress in the resolution of mass spectrometry facilitated the identification of IgE binding proteins. This approach is strongly depended on the availability of large protein databases.

Commonly used hosts for the production include e.g. Escherichia coli , Pichia pastoris and mammalian cell lines. Allergens from natural sources are collected either from the whole organism or dedicated parts of it e.g. pollen or fruits. In both cases the proteins of interest are extracted with biochemical methods and purified using chromatography (affinity, SEC, IEX etc.). A very important aspect after the preparation of allergens or allergen extracts is the verification and determination of the biological relevance by serology and/or in vivo tests.

Topical (intranasal) glucocorticosteroids are perhaps one of the most effective modes of therapy since they control nasal congestion, one of the most difficult symptoms associated with AR to resolve Properly prescribed subcutaneous or sublingual allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is another cost -effective treatment for ARAmbient air, as it enters the nose, whatever its temperature and humidity, is warmed and humidi- fied almost to body temperature by the time it reaches the laryn- gopharynx. Likewise, a normal anatomy and intact and normally functioning mucosal and muco- cilliary transport system results in filtration of most particles greater than 4.5 microns. Allergic rhinitis (AR) disrupts the normal function of the upper airway causing con- siderable disability, comorbidities, and loss of quality-of-life (QoL). GOALS OF TREATMENT The primary goal of a physician or other healthcare professional di- agnosing and treating any upper airway disease is to restore nor- mal function to the upper airway. To do so, an understanding of nor- mal anatomy, physiology, local and systemic defense systems, and various diseases which affect the upper airway (Figure 1) is of par- amount importance. For example, nasal obstruction not only occurs from nasal mucosal edema associ- ated with AR, but also, to mention a few, from a severely deviated na- sal septum, nasal polyposis (NP), various medications and large ad- enoids and tonsils. Likewise, other symptoms of AR such as sneezing, TREATMENT OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS - OVERVIEW 1 KEY MESSAGES itching, and rhinorrhea can be as- sociated with a variety of different upper airway diseases, such as lar- yngopharyngeal esophageal reflux disease, non-allergic rhinitis, and acute and chronic rhinosinusitis. Thus, restoring normal nasal phys- iologic function, in other words patency of the upper airway and resolution of excessive rhinorrhea and irritation of the nose mani- fested by sneezing and nasal pru-ritus is the primary goal of treating AR. Ideally, AR treatment should restore and enable the patient to achieve normal social function, olfaction, taste, and restful and peaceful sleep. Controlling AR is of paramount importance for QoL issues and to decrease the severity of co-mor- bidities associated with AR. A de- creased QoL associated with AR is often greater than with many Treatment of allergic rhinitis - overviewRichard F. Lockey University of South Florida Morsani College of Medicine Tampa, Florida187GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION E - Allergic rhinitis - treatment Treatment of allergic rhinitis - overviewother diseases, including asthma. This is not only because of the symptoms primarily associated with AR rhinitis but also because of associated symptoms such as post-nasal drip, red, itchy, watery eyes, headaches, facial discom- fort, and ear discomfort (Figure 2). Mostly, AR patients feel tired, ir- ritable, and sometimes depressed, not to mention the fact that they are often embarrassed because of symptoms associated with their malfunctioning upper airway (Fig- ure 3). Co-morbidities of AR in- clude asthma, atopic acute rhinosinusitis, chronic rhinosinus- itis with/without nasal polyps, frequent upper respiratory tract infections, otitis media and oth- ers. Secondary problems can re- sult, for example sleep disorders, learning disabilities, and dental malocclusion (Table 1). In addition the financial burden is a consider- able problem as measured by the direct and indirect costs derived from absenteeism from work and school, as well as from decreased productivity. RATIONALE AND METHODS TO TREAT Treatment of AR is more scientif- ically based and effective than it has been in the past. For example, elimination of an of - fending allergen from a patient's environment al - ways has been an effective method to control symp - toms of AR. How - ever, today, there is a better rationale and more knowl - edge about how to eliminate one allergen versus another and the time it takes to do so. It is now rec - ognized that dif - ferent dust mites affect different geographic popu -lations throughout the world and that it takes up to five to six months to eliminate pet dander from the home. Cockroach allergens may af - fect those who live in the inner city. Second generation antihistamines are not more effective to control the symptoms of AR than first gen - eration antihistamines, but they are Figure 1 The complexity of the upper airways - the lateral nasal wall.

Topical (intranasal) glucocorticos - teroids are one of the most effec - tive modes of therapy for the ma - jority of symptoms of AR. Intranasal dexamethasone was used over 40 to 50 years ago, however, today, in - halational corticosteroids, appropri - ately prescribed, are equally effec - tive to dexamethasone and devoid of short- and long-term side effects. New to the repertoire of treatments available is a combined glucocorti - costeroid - antihistamine for intra - nasal use, with superior effects than each molecule in isolation. Topical ipratropium bromide, is an excellent medication to control rhinorrhea and is mostly devoid of significant side effects. Other treatment mo - dalities, including improved meth - ods to administer intranasal saline, leukotriene inhibitors and blockers, as well as oral sympathomimetics can be of benefit to certain patients. Sophisticated newer treatments, such as the use of monoclonal an- tibodies, may also benefit AR patients but will only be useful if costs are reduced. Another treatment strategy is to induce tolerance to the allergens by allergen-specific subcutaneous or sublingual allergen immuno - therapy (AIT). The aim of AIT is to induce tolerance to the allergens, with resolution of allergen-induced inflammation and symptoms. CONCLUSION In summary, appropriate treat- ment of AR is of paramount im- portance for the patient who suf- fers from this disease. The primary goal for any physician is to restore normal upper airway function and thereby control or prevent comor- bidities and assure a normal qual- ity-of-life. There is an old clich\u00e9 which states \"As goes the nose, so goes the chest\"; if you appro- priately treat AR, asthma is more easily controlled. Figure 2 Allergies in America.

Most environmental allergens are almost impossible to avoid, because they are either too prevalent or because it would seriously hamper professional or social life. TREE, GRASS AND WEED POLLEN Symptoms of pollen-induced AR occur upon exposure to pollen at the beginning of the season and disappear once the pollen season has finished. During the pollen season, total avoidance of exposure to pollen is hardly pos- sible, unless patients emigrate to a country where the trees, grasses or weeds are not in bloom. Per- sonal protection such as wearing sun glasses may reduce exposure in pollen allergic patients but most patients will be dependent on medication for symptom relief. HOUSE DUST MITE Dust mite allergen is present not only at home in beds, carpets and furniture but also in public spac- es such as hospitals, public buses and cinemas (Figure 1). Total erad-MANAGEMENT OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS - ALLERGEN AVOIDANCE 2 KEY MESSAGES ication is impossible. Encasings for mattresses, pillows and duvets reduce the amount of mite aller- gen but do not diminish symp- toms. Special vacuum cleaners do contain the allergens but the user will be exposed to allergens while vacuum cleaning. Other measures such as washing on high temper- atures kill house dust mites but do not prevent repossession of the fabric by the house dust mite. Essentially, the optimal situation at home will be a reduction of exposure by choosing non-fabric flooring and furniture, cleaning regularly and washing as much as possible at 55 degrees or higher. However, even if one manages to keep mite exposure at home to a minimum, exposure outside the home occurs and can evoke symp- toms.ANIMAL ALLERGENS Animal allergens are to be found everywhere including the homes of people who themselves don't keep them. Exposure is also present in public transport and public places such as hospitals, buses, schools and pubs (Figure 1). Reducing al - lergen production by washing the animal has in case of cats been shown ineffective. The so called hypoallergenic animals such as the Labradoodle have been proven a myth: research showed that this dog produces normal amounts of allergen and that the allergen can be found in dust samples of the homes of their owners (Figure 2). Allergy to animals can not only hamper social life, it can force pa - tients to change jobs, for instance laboratory workers developing al - lergies to rats or mice, with serious effects on income.

The initial event in AR is the inter - action of allergen, with mast cell bound IgE. The histamine released in the resultant degranulation is primarily responsible for the ear - ly phase symptoms. These symp - toms, shown in green in Figure 1, are rhinorrhoea, itching, sneezing and vasodilation. Mast cell-derived cytokines initiate allergic inflam - mation in which the influx and activation of eosinophils results in accentuation of local nerve re - flexes to cause nasal blockage (red in Figure 1) and reflex mediated conjunctival symptoms. Consider - ing these mechanisms, H1-antihis - tamines are particularly effective against the histamine-mediated early phase symptoms of AR. All H1-antihistamines also have weak anti-inflammatory activity and so have some effect on nasal block - age. However, this is slow in onset (weeks) and weak compared with nasal corticosteroids. ARIA recommends avoidance of first-generation oral H1-antihista- mines which readily diffuse into the brain. Histamine is an impor- tant neurotransmitter in the brain where it increases arousal in the circadian sleep/wake cycle and reinforces learning and memo- ry. These effects are blocked by first-generation H1-antihista- mines, which also reduce the du- Antihistamines in the treatment of allergic rhinitisMartin K Church Charit\u00e9 Medical University Berlin, Germany TABLE 1 Common H1-Antihistamines 1st CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION E - Allergic rhinitis - treatmentration of REM sleep when taken at night (Figure 2). Furthermore, the long half-lives of drugs such as diphenhydramine, chlorphe- niramine and hydroxyzine, 24 hours, mean that these effects are still present next morning leading to daytime somnolence, increased traffic accidents, decreased pro- ductivity at work and reduced children's learning. Second-gener- ation H1-antihistamines are large- ly devoid of these effects. H1-antihistamines may be adminis - tered either orally or topically. Giv - en orally, their onset of action is in 1-4 hours and once a day dosage is usually sufficient. Most second generation H1-antihistamines have little or no central nervous system effects but somnolence may occur with some drugs in some patients. Intranasal antihistamines have the advantage of rarely causing system - ic effects but have the disadvantag - es of twice-daily dosage and being less convenient than tablets. Used as monotherapy, H1-antihistamines should be administered continu - ously while symptoms are present. Alternatively, the may be used in - termittently for symptom exacer - bations in individuals being treated with intranasal corticosteroids. KEY REFERENCES 1.

ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION E - Allergic rhinitis - treatment Intranasal steroids (INS) are the most effective medication cl ass in controlling the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (AR) INS may provide significant relief of symptoms of intermitte nt or persistent AR The overall clinical response does not appear to vary signi ficantly between available INS, irrespective of the differences in topic al potency, lipid solubility, and binding affinity When given in recommended doses INS are not associated with clinically significant systemic side effectsThe main mechanism by which in- tranasal steroids (INS) relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (AR) is through their anti-inflammatory activity, although it is possible that they may exert an effect through other non genomic mechanisms. The rationale for using INS in the treatment of AR is that high drug concentrations can be achieved at receptor sites in the nasal mucosa with a minimal risk of systemic ad- verse effects. INS are effective in controlling all the four major symptoms of AR: sneezing, itching, rhinorrhea and especially nasal congestion. They also control the ocular symptoms of rhinoconjunctivitis. Meta-analyses confirmed that INS are the most effective therapeutic agents for AR (Table 1). INS are su - perior or equal to the combination of an antihistamine and an antileu - kotriene. ARIA Guidelines 2010 recommend INS for treatment of AR in adults (strong recommen - dation | high quality evidence) and suggest INS in children with AR (conditional recommendation | moderate quality evidence). This recommendation places a relative - ly high value on the efficacy of INS, and a relatively low value on avoid - ing their possible adverse effects.TREATMENT OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS - NASAL STEROIDS 4 KEY MESSAGES Due to their mechanism of action, efficacy appears after 7-8 h of dosing, but maximum efficacy may require up to 2 weeks. However, some patients benefit within the first 2 hours. The general characteristics of the formulations of INS and rec- ommended doses in children and adults are shown in Table 2. Systematic reviews compared INS to other active treatments and re- ported a low incidence of adverse effects. Epistaxis, headache, ab- normal taste, and pharyngitis were the most frequently reported side effects. None of the short-term treatment studies analyzed in the reviews reported systemic side ef-fects from INS, although there has been concern that their prolonged use may be associated with sys- temic adverse effects including suppression of the hypothalam- ic-pituitary-adrenal axis and sup- pression of growth in children. Recently, it has been shown that fluticasone furoate administered over 52 weeks in prepubescent children resulted in a small reduc- tion in growth velocity compared with placebo. Patient education on the proper administration technique is very important since the incorrect use leads to treatment failure or ad- verse events such as epistaxis (in 10-15% of patients).

This family of oxylip - ins produced by 5-lipoxygenation (5-LO) of arachidonic acid chemoattractant LTB4 (Figure 2). CysLTs are synthe - sized by activated mast cells and eosinophils.

Many respiratory symptoms elicited by CysLTs are mediated by the activation of type-1 receptor (CysLT1R), although the presence of other receptors for CysLT in the respiratory system has been postu - lated.

A comprehen- sive review described a decrease in daytime nasal symptoms in AR patients treated with montelukast versus placebo in 5 out of 6 RCTs. In addition, combined therapy with montelukast and lorata- dine or with topical steroids also showed improvement of daytime AR symptoms. Beneficial effects were experienced both by pa- tients with seasonal and perennial AR. The 6th RCT included in the analysis, comparing montelukast as add-on to intranasal fluticasone propionate monotherapy, failed to show advantages in patients with intermittent AR during 6 weeks of treatment. Currently, montelukast is recommended in moderate to severe AR as a combination with intranasal corticosteroids and/ or oral antihistamines.

Many nasal symptoms are mediated by the activation of CYSLT1R, including the autocrine activation of mast cells. Novel inhibitors of FLAP under development in addition to CYSLT1R antagonists. Figure 1 Exposure to aeroallergens perpetuates allergic inflammation by continuous production of specific IgE, degranulation of mucosal mast cells (early phase) and release of chemical mediators (chemokines, CysLTs) by activated mast cells, eosinophils and lymphocytes-T. Since CysLTs act in concert with other cytokines, no significant impact on AR is expected using antileukotrienes monotherapy.

In addition eye symptoms and night-symptoms improved, with the greatest effect by the end of the two-months trial. In summary, selective targeting of the CysLTs pathway is not expect -ed to bring spectacular improve - ment in AR. However, addition of a CysLT1R antagonist is effective in moderate/severe persistent AR following regular treatment during at least two months. The inhibition of 5-LO or 5-LO activating protein (FLAP) might potentiate the effects of antileukotriene therapy of AR, however, drugs with a satisfacto - ry pharmacokinetics are still under development (Figure 2, Table 2).KEY REFERENCES 1.

While isotonic and hypertonic na- sal sprays, based on a great varie- ty of active agents such as lipos- omes, ectoine, herbal compounds, cellulose, and vaseline are already widely used, alternative methods such as thermal water applica- tions, endonasal phototherapy or even acupuncture are also gain- ing more importance. The mech- anisms of action are of different nature (Figures 1 and 2). Nasal sprays and nasal irrigations un- fold their effect by implementing by creating a hydrofilm as a me- chanical barrier. They thus aim to strengthen resistance to airborn allergens and iritants. Saline nasal irrigation belongs to those complementary non-phar- macologic treatment options with a relieving effect on symptoms of the AR. A meta-analysis of 10 studies investigated its' effect as adjuvant therapy. Nasal symp- toms were reduced by 27.66%, CONSERVATIVE NON-DRUG TREATMENT FOR ALLERGIC RHINITIS 7 KEY MESSAGES while simultaneously less rescue medication (-62.1%) was applied and the patient's quality of life was improved (+27.88%). Likewise, in a meta-analysis, an ectoine-based nasal spray has been shown to reduce the severity for all relevant rhinitis symptoms to the same extent as traditional agents. Nasal obstruction, rhinor- rhea, and itching eyes improved by 29.94%, 31.49%, and 33.49%. Similarly, the nasal administration of liposomes was also compared with guideline-recommended therapeutic regimes in several small open-label trials. The liposo- mal sprays showed good results in clinical tolerability as well as in re- ducing typical rhinitis symptoms.Thermal water irrigations and in- halations offer a new additional approach in AR despite having a century-old tradition in Roman practices. A systematic review revealed that nasal flow, nasal re- sistance and mucociliary clearing time were significantly improved using thermal water applications while only little side effects were documented. A fairly new concept is an endona- sal phototherapy with rhinolight, utilizing the immunosuppressive effects of UV radiation by direct- ing UV-A, UV-B and visible light into the nasal cavity (Figure 3). Al- though its effectiveness has been demonstrated in clinical studies, the risk of damaging the mucosa has not been assessed sufficiently.

AIT triggers multi- ple sequentially activated mech- anisms, which work in concert leading to clinical events eliciting rapid desensitization to allergen, long-term allergen-specific im- mune tolerance as well as the sup- pression of allergic inflammation. AIT induces a shift in the propor- tion of IL-4-secreting T helper (Th) 2 cells in favor of IL-10-secreting inducible T regulatory cells (iTreg) specific for the same allergenic epitope, which increase in number and function. Different types of iTreg control several facets of al- lergic inflammation. They are com- posed of FOXP3+ (Forkhead box protein 3) adaptive T regulatory (Treg) cells and FOXP3 negative, but IL-10-producing Tr1 cells. A significant correlation is found be- tween improvement of symptoms and the increase in Treg cell num- bers during AIT. Recently the B regulatory cells (B reg) character- ized as CD73-CD25+CD71+ cells ALLERGEN IMMUNOTHERAPY FOR ALLERGIC RHINITIS - OVERVIEW 8a KEY MESSAGES were found in increased numbers in subjects undergoing AIT. Breg cells regulate IgG4 versus IgE and induce allergen-specific antibod- ies towards the non-anaphylactic and non-inflammatory type. The shift in isotype production cannot however, explain the therapeutic effect of AIT probably due to a very long IgE lifespan. iTregs sup- press allergen-specific T cells in both their regulatory and effector functions. T cell suppression can take place both in the secondary lymphoid organs and in the affect- ed tissues. iTreg are also capable of suppression of innate effec- tor cells of allergic inflammation (mast cells, basophils) and induce decrease of eosinophils in the mu- cosal tissues. The understanding of the AIT mechanisms helps in elaboration of early and late di- agnostic biomarkers to select the best responders and to optimize the treatment. INDICATIONS AND EFFICACY AIT is indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe intermit- tent or persistent symptoms of AR. Usually AIT is recommended in subjects over 5 years of age, however sublingual AIT is safe and effective even in children as young as 3 years of age. The rec- ommended duration of AIT for AR is 3 years, both for the subcutane- ous and the sublingual routes.

The major advantage of AIT in the treatment of AR is the preven- tion of asthma and the reduction of new sensitizations. AIT should only be performed with standardized allergen ex- tracts, which are currently availa- ble for grass, tree, and weed (rag- weed, mugwort) pollens; house dust mites; several mold species and animal dander. Pharmacoeco- nomic studies demonstrated a clear advantage of AIT over phar- macologic therapies. KEY REFERENCES 1. Akdis M, Akdis CA.

The dose is built up over 7-12 weekly injections; if maintenance injections are re- quired these are given every 4-6 weeks for about 3 years. CLINICAL EFFICACY The value of SCIT for seasonal AR has been confirmed in many ran- domized placebo-controlled trials. Improvement is expected in about 80% of patients; symptoms are re- duced rather than abolished, with a marked reduction in the number of days with very bad symptoms compared to untreated or place- bo-treated controls. In patients with perennial AR, it can be difficult to work out how much of their symptoms are due to allergy. SCIT with HDM ex- tracts can be effective in con- trolling symptoms of perennial AR but patient selection is critical. If there is no benefit after 6 months, SCIT is unlikely to be effective and alternative strategies should be considered. SCIT can be used in SUBCUTANEOUS ALLERGEN IMMUNOTHERAPY FOR ALLERGIC RHINITIS 8b KEY MESSAGES cat allergy but is usually restricted to people with occupational ex- posure. There is no corresponding data for dog allergy. EVIDENCE OF DISEASE MODIFICATION SCIT may have long term benefits by modifying the course of the disease, whereas drug therapies only suppress the symptoms while they are taken. Two outcomes of- fer evidence of disease modifica- tion - the prevention of asthma in patients treated for AR and the prevention of new allergic sensiti- sations (Figure 1). After cessation of SCIT treatment, there is a slow recurrence of symptoms over the first 3 years after completing SCIT, but no appreciable increase there- after.ADVERSE REACTIONS TO SCIT Localized and systemic reactions may occur after SCIT. Local reac- tions are commoner during the build-up phase than during main- tenance, but do not predict sub- sequent occurrence of systemic reactions. Systemic reactions are more serious and can very rarely prove fatal. Consequently, SCIT injections should only be given in clinics familiar with SCIT and by clinicians able to deal with ana- phylactic side-effects. FUTURE DIRECTIONS Given the time, cost and risks of conventional SCIT, there is in- terest in modifications that may increase efficacy, simplify the re- gime or improve safety (Table 1).

The use of SLIT has been included in inter- national guidelines for the treat- ment of allergic rhinitis (AR) with or without conjunctivitis. SLIT can be administered as drops or tab- lets for respiratory allergies due to grass, tree, ragweed pollens and house dust mites. At present, SLIT is commercialised and rou- tinely used in some countries in Europe (e.g., France and Italy) and is becoming popular in many other countries around the world. Some SLIT products have also been re- cently approved by the FDA in the USA. CLINICAL EFFICACY The clinical efficacy of SLIT is well documented in different double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trials (DBPC RCTs) and meta-analyses (Tables 1 and 2). SLIT significantly reduces symptoms scores and the use of rescue medication in both adults and children. Large clinical and methodological heterogeneity was detected in these analyses. New well-powered well-designed multinational DBPC RCTs using almost comparable clinical out-SUBLINGUAL IMMUNOTHERAPY FOR ALLERGIC RHINITIS 8c KEY MESSAGES comes and standardised sublingual products have demon- strated sustained clinical effica- cy in the active group relative to placebo. These studies have also indicated a disease modification effect observed 2 years after the completion of 3 years of treat- ment with SLIT-tablets for grass pollen allergy. SAFETY The safety profile of SLIT is ex- tremely good; therefore, SLIT can be self-administrated by the pa- tients in their homes. However, it is recommended that the first dose should always be given to the patient in the presence of a physician. This is to re-assure the patient about the expected local symptoms he/she can experience while taking the medication. Most reported symptoms are self-lim- ited, mild in severity and do not require any other relief medica- tion. Local symptoms are itching/ tingling of the lips, mouth or/and oral mucosa; mild local swelling of lips, sublingual area or tongue. Very rarely, systemic reactions ap- pear. Few so-called anaphylactic cases have been globally reported. No fatalities are related to SLIT. Good adherence to SLIT is critical for its success, at least 3-4 visits per year should be programmed to evaluate adherence and clinical response to SLIT.

SLIT products should be placed under the tongue, allowing the al- lergen to be in contact for at least 2 minutes with the oral mucosa through dendritic cells. The aller- gens cross the mucosa in 15 - 30 minutes. They are then captured by tolerogenic dendritic cells and processed as small peptides. Then, via the lymphatic system a systemic immune response is cre- ated, aiming to produce an early decrease in mast cell and basophil degranulation. This is followed by generation of allergen-specific Treg cells and suppression of al- lergen-specific Th1 and Th2 cells and possibly other effector cells. An early increase and a very late decrease in specific IgE levels are observed. IgG4 levels show a rel- atively early increase that is dose dependent. A significant decrease in the allergen-specific IgE/ IgG4 ratio occurs after several months.

The ability to prevent the allerr- gic immune response is a primary goal of AIT, and new advances in immunotherapeutics directed at inducing T-cell tolerance, shifting the balance in Th2 vs Th1 cellular subtypes, or upregulating T-reg- ulatory cells are at stage of promising Phase 2-3 clinical de- velopment. T-CELL-TOLERIZING PEPTIDES A therapeutic approach in AIT uses T-cell-tolerizing peptides to induce immune tolerance and thereby suppress IgE-mediated diseases. Early work in this re- search area was carried out by Gefter and colleagues in the mid- 1990s, and these studies provided the first evidence that synthetic T-cell-tolerising peptides could in- duce tolerance and thereby open a treatment pathway to suppress IgE-mediated allergic diseases such as cat and ragweed-induced rhinitis and asthma. Gefter's lab NEW VACCINES FOR ALLERGEN IMMUNOTHERAPY 8d KEY MESSAGES developed both cat (two 27 amino acid peptides derived from Fel d 1 ) and ragweed (derived from Amb a 1), T-cell-tolerizing peptides, and in collaborative work with Nor- man and Creticos, demonstrated that administration of these pep- tides, in various subcutaneous treatment regimens, resulted in significant improvement in cat-in- duced clinical symptoms in studies utilizing cat broncho-provocation or natural cat room challenges and in multicenter field trials of the ragweed vaccine. However, these first-generation peptides were not optimal when compared to conventional AIT, as they were longer sequenced peptides (potentially exposing IgE epitopes), too few in number (hence, not providing a more com- plete immune protection), and required administration of higher subcutaneous doses which were associated with late-onset ad- verse events.

These novel peptides are specifi- cally designed to induce immuno- logic tolerance through binding to MHC class II molecules on anti- gen-presenting cells, with subse- quent up-regulation of regulatory T-cells (Figure 1). A key advantage of these peptides lies in their smaller size; i.e., molecules that are of insufficient length to trigger cross-linking of IgE on mast cells and basophils, thus significantly reducing the risk of IgE-mediated allergic reactions (e.g., asthma, an- gioedema/urticaria, or anaphylax- is). MECHANISTIC STUDIES The leading SPIRE construct is the cat peptide derived from Fel d 1, the major cat allergenic moiety.

Fur- thermore, evidence for the role of IL-10 in the underlying mecha- nism of action is provided by the observation that administration of anti-IL-10 monoclonal antibody, immediately post-treatment with the peptide, blocked the positive peptide-inducing effects. Subse- quently, initial safety and efficacy work was published which defined the optimal peptide construct and the applicability of a short intra- dermal injection regimen. SALIENT CLINICAL STUDIES Utilizing a controlled cat allergen environmental exposure chamber (EEC) model, dose-ranging and dose-dependent clinical efficacy and safety studies have demon- strated that a long-lasting persis- tence of effect [i.e., improvement in total rhinitis clinical symptoms (TRSS)] can be demonstrated as far out as 1-year after comple- tion of a concise injection regi- men (6 nmol x 4 ID injs x 4 wks apart) (Figure 2). A subgroup of subjects followed for 2 years has now shown a similar magnitude of effect upon chamber expo- sure. The magnitude of change in TRSS scores in the EEC model (~4 TRSS units vs placebo) compares favorably with chamber studies performed with cat SCIT (3u), cat SLIT-drops (1.6u), or an antihis- tamine (1.3u). Furthermore, the evidence for a long-lasting effect parallels that observed with SCIT and SLIT in which 3-year courses of treatment are necessitated to obtain a sustained treatment ef- fect in the 2-years post-cessation of treatment. A large Phase 3 multicenter rand- omized DBPC clinical field trial is currently underway with the cat construct, and the findings from this trial should further elucidate the potential for this novel immu- notherapeutic in the treatment of cat allergy. In addition, the SPIRE platform has further branched into ragweed, grass, and house dust mite development programs. CONCLUSION Synthetic peptides comprised of T-cell epitopes, derived from known amino acid sequences of specific relevant allergens, afford a unique opportunity through a short intradermal injection regi- men to safely and effectively in- duce immunologic tolerance and hence initiate long-lasting clinical efficacy.

In contrast, side effects are mediated by mast cells and via blood vessels The ideal route for AIT is characterized by high density of DC s, T- and B-cells, but low density of mast cells and blood vessels Lymph nodes contain masses of DCs, T- and B-cells, but few mast cells. Intralymphatic AIT (ILIT) was safe and the number of allergen injections cold be reduced to three The epidermis contains dense DCs and no mast cells or blood vessels. Epicutaneous AIT (EPIT) was safe and the allergen administrations could be reduced to 6 patchesFor allergic rhinitis (AR) allergen specific immunotherapy (AIT) is the only causal treatment with long-term efficacy that in ad- dition prevents progression to asthma. Current AIT suffers from two short-comings. First, allergen administration causes allergic ad- verse effects. Local adverse ef- fects are mediated by mast cells at the site of allergen administration, whereas systemic adverse effects occur when allergen reaches blood vessels and activates basophils or gets distributed systemically to tissue resident mast cells (Figure 1). The second short coming is that current AIT requires numer- ous allergen administrations over three to five years and thus is time consuming. Due to these two dis- advantages few allergic patients opt to undergo AIT and treatment adherence is poor. HOW TO IMPROVE SAFETY? Local and systemic allergic side effects can be prevented by re- ducing the IgE binding capacity of the therapeutic allergen, either by chemical or recombinant mod- ification, or by use of oligopep- tides representing merely T cell epitopes. Another strategy to re- duce local side effects is choosing a route of allergen delivery, which AIT FOR ALLERGIC RHINITIS - NEW DELIVERY OPTIONS 8e KEY MESSAGES is characterized by low density or absence of mast cells. Also, sys- temic side effects should be pre- ventable, when choosing a route characterized by low density or absence of blood vessels, mini- mizing risk for systemic allergen distribution. HOW TO REDUCE OF ALLERGEN ADMINISTRATIONS? The number of allergen be reduced by en- hancing the immunological effects of each administration. AIT works by inducing blocking antibodies, T helper 1- and regulatory T cells, orchestrated by dendritic cells (DCs). Immunological effects are classically enhanced by bacterial prod- ucts such the lipopolysaccharides derivative monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) or bacterial DNA allows reducing the number of injec- tions to 4 or 6. Another strategy is choosing an administration route which is characterized by high density of DCs, B- and T-cells. INTRALYMPHATIC IMMUNOTHERAPY (ILIT) In lymph nodes, the density of DCs, B- and T-cells is maximal, whereas the density of mast cells is low.

While the therapeutic effects of AIT are mediated by DCs, T-cells and B-cells, the local adverse effects are mediated by mast cells at the site of injection and the systemic adverse effects are mediated when allergen accidentally reaches the blood circulation so that it can activate basophils and/or tissue resident mast cells. Therefore the ideal route for allergen administration should be characterized by a high density of DCs, T- and B-cells, but a low density of mast cells and blood vessels.

They are bi- omedicines requiring a marketing authorization both in the EU and the US. The quality and consist- ency of biomedicines strongly depends on the standardization of the production process. More- over, due to natural biovariability of the composition of source ma- terials, AIT extracts are difficult to standardize. In the US, clinical development begins with an investigation- al new drug (IND) application. While not mandatory, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) encourages a Pre-IND meeting, for which supporting documen- tation includes the investigational plan and an outline of chemistry, manufacturing and control (CMC) information. The subsequent IND application includes a Phase 1 protocol to support safety. Phase 2 studies determine proper dos- ing range and support efficacy, after which the sponsor is en- couraged to request an End of Phase 2 (EOP2) meeting to dis- cuss criteria for successful Phase 3 studies. Within 60 days of the REGULATION AND STANDARDIZATION OF AIT EXTRACTS 8f KEY MESSAGES EOP2 meeting a sponsor should submit their initial pediatric study plan (iPSP). The iPSP must in- clude plans for pediatric studies, and any plans to request waivers or deferrals of the requirement to submit data to support use of the product in pediatric popula- tions at the time of submission of a biologics license application. Phase 3 protocols should include comprehensive CMC information and (ideally) a Statistical Analysis Plan. The product used for Phase 3 studies should be manufactured in the same facilities and using the same process intended for the licensed product. After com- pletion of Phase 3, the sponsor is encouraged to request a pre-BLA meeting to discuss the proposed content of a BLA, which should Regulation and standardization of AIT extractsRonald L.

Af- ter approval of a BLA, the manu- facturer is authorized to market a product for interstate commerce in the US (Figure 1). In the EU allergen extracts are au- thorized at the level of individual member states (MS). Once a prod- uct is authorized in one MS the license can be extended to other MS by a mutual recognition proce- dure. Moreover, the decentralized procedure, in which one MS acts as reference member state (RMS) allows to simultaneously obtain a marketing authorization in two to all MS. The system of clinical test- ing is similar to the US, and medi- cal agencies offer scientific advice to pharmaceutical companies and other sponsors (similar to Pre-IND meetings). Approval of a pediatric investigation plan by the Europe- an Medicines Agency is required before an authorization of the products for use in adults can be granted (Figure 2). In the EU, biological allergen standardisation is mainly based on skin testing during develop- ment of a new product and on IgE inhibition tests comparing a given extract batch with a refer- ence preparation for evaluating batch to batch consistency. In the US, FDA allergen standards and allergic human reference sera are used, while the system in the EU is based on In House Reference Preparations (extracts) and human sera pools that are manufacturer specific. Recent progress in aller- gen standardisation are the devel- opment and validation of purified recombinant allergen standards and the use of sandwich ELISA systems for determination of indi- vidual allergens in extracts, as well as proteomic tools such as mass spectrometry.

How- ever, most of the modern tools are currently studied and will proba- bly be marketed only for asthma for non-scientific but mainly eco- nomic reasons: disease related costs as well as impairment for the quality of life in patients suffering from asthma is much more rele- vant compared to AR which is by many physicians and health care providers still considered trivial, transient and relatively \"cheap\" disease. Studies have indicated, however, that around 50 % of the patients affected have to be categorized as persistent AR with severe impair- ment which means that the dai- ly life of the affected patients in school or work is markedly affect- ed. Still the aspect of cost effec- tiveness with modern antiallergic biologicals and monoclonal anti- bodies will be discussed not only within the scientific society but also by health of authorities and payers.TREATMENT OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS WITH BIOLOGICALS AND MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES 9 KEY MESSAGES So far in most countries patients with AR are treated according to international or national guide- lines, primarily with modern antihistamines (oral or topical) and topical corticosteroids. The treatment effect of this pharma- cotherapeutic approach is well documented, but not really im- pressive. Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is applied by the subcuta- neous or sublingual route. It can be assumed that the AIT disease modifying effect is stronger than drug treatments, although head- to-head comparisons are not real- ly available for final and conclusive judgments. Since anti-IgE has become avail- able, a number of studies have been performed in seasonal AR. anti-IgE was applied either alone or together with AIT (Figure 1). A recent metaanalysis concludes that in seasonal and perenial AR treatment with Omalizumab pro- vides an improvement of daily nasal symptoms severity score or reduction of anti-allergic medi- cation, compared with placebo. Looking at the different trials it is obvious, that not all of these studies are adequately powered so that larger clinical trials and economic studies are still needed to address the issues of rare ad- verse events occurrence or cost effectiveness respectively. So far one can conclude that Omalizum- ab as the only biological which has so far been investigated in AR is significantly associated with symptom relief, decreased rescue medication use and improve qual- ity of life in patients with inade- quately controlled AR or rhinosi- nusitis refractory to conventional treatment.

Given the fact that in atopic dis- eases, particularly in children and adolescents, the majority of pa- tients develop IgE-mediated co- morbidities in the lower airways, the skin or the gastrointestinal tract, it is mandatory, that future pathogenesis oriented systemic intervention will also carefully as- sess the effect of the treatment with biologicals on AR. In addition AR patients with a broad spec- trum of relevant seasonal or per-ennial allergies may benefit better from a nonspecific antiallergic approach using monoclonal anti- bodies, if they are not sufficiently controlled by standard treatment, rather though AIT.

Inflammation in AR is driven by a variety of cell types including mast cell activation, the infiltration of sensitized tissues by eosinophils and T helper type 2 (Th2) lym- phocytes. Recent advances in the understanding of new pathways and factors involved in allergic diseases suggest new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of AR. Toll-like receptors (TLR) belong to a large family of pattern recogni- tion receptors known as the an- cient 'gatekeepers' of the immune system. TLRs are located at the first line of defense against invad- ing pathogens (bacteria and virus- es) as well as aeroallergens. They can modulate the Th2 specific al- lergic immune response towards a Th1 response, which make them appropriate adjuvants for allergy vaccines, as well as as stand-alone therapeutics to treat symptoms of AR patients. Using oligonucle- otides enriched in CpG motifs as a TLR-9 TLR ago- nist against and TLR-8 have been successfully in- vestigated in early clinical trials in AR (Table 1).OTHER TARGETED TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR ALLERGIC RHINITIS 10 KEY MESSAGES Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), an ara - chidonic acid metabolite, is a key mediator in inflammation after al - lergen exposure and is released by IgE-activated mast cells and by oth - er inflammatory cell types. PGD2 helps in recruiting and activating Th2 lymphocytes, eosinophils and basophils (Figure 1). Nasal challenge with PGD2 induces a greater de - gree of nasal congestion than that induced by histamine. The proin - flammatory effects of PGD2 occur through interactions with the che - moattractant receptor homologous molecule on Th2 cells (CRTH2), a 7-transmembrane type G pro - tein-coupled receptor selectively expressed on Th2 cells, T cytotoxic type 2 cells, eosinophils, and baso - phils (Figure 1). Around 20 CRTH2 (or DP2 receptor) antagonists have been developed into clinical devel - opment with different effectivity for systemic treatment of AR. A re - duction in nasal allergic symptoms as well as in local nasal biomarkers has been shown in patients with AR exposed to grass pollen. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short single stranded RNA mol- ecules that posttranscriptionally silence gene expression and have been shown to fine-tune gene transcriptional networks. Specif- ic miRNAs have been found to have critical roles in regulating key pathogenic mechanisms in models of preclinical allergic inflamma- tion (eg, miR-21).

While genome wide anal- yses are history in asthma and at- opic dermatitis (Figure 1) and the field moves on to whole exome and whole genome sequencing, genome wide association stud- ies are still sparse in AR. When it comes to pharmacogenetic stud- ies of AR, current knowledge is al- most non-existing. Potential rea- sons may be that (a) all patients are perfectly treated or even cured by current medication and treatment or that (b) there are no side effects with current therapy so that phar- macogenetic studies to optimize treatment are not needed. Neither (a) nor (b) seems likely the case. Current standard therapy for AR in most cases and countries is sys- temic and/or local antihistamines, topic steroids or AIT. For histamine receptors and genes within histamine related pathway genes, knowledge on common and rare mutations exists, but studies investigating their effects in patients with AR under these therapies is lacking. For steroids, pharmacogenetic studies have PHARMACOGENETICS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS 11 KEY MESSAGES been performed, but not consid- ering topic nasally applied steroids in patients with AR. Pharmacoge- netic (and pharmacoepigenetic) studies in AIT have never been performed so far, but could be of greatest interest to the whole allergy field as these may lead to the identification of mechanisms related to tolerance induction and individual susceptibility to allergy or tolerance development. There is a new wave of treatment options on the horizon that may eventually also change clinical practice in AR. With biologicals reaching severe asthma therapy, also patients with AR (at least with an asthma/AR overlap syndrome) will be treated with these targeted approaches. Thus, profiling these patients for mutations in IL13, IL5 and other specific targets of bio- logicals will be necessary in the future. Obviously, there is a big unmet need for pharmacogenet- ics in AR to tailor and individualize therapy. KEY REFERENCES 1. Portelli MA, Hodge E, Sayers I.

Pharmacologic treat- ment and allergen immunotherapy (AIT) are the two primary choices in the conventional approach to AR. Outside of these options lies complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Worries about concurrent side effects of con- ventional anti-allergic medication could be one of the major reasons for more AR patients to seek help from CAM (Figure 1). Acupuncture and herbal thera- pies are current the most popular CAM strategies for AR, followed by vitamin therapy, tea therapy, massage and Ayurveda etc (Table 1). Some of these methods have shown great efficacy in treating AR and others have not. CAMs are supposed to be therapeutic effec- tive via modulating the immune system, by affecting the balance between the Th1 and Th2 cell-de- rived cytokines.

Acu- puncture decreases nasal symp- tom scores and improves quality of life with no serious systemic re- action or side effects. Its efficien- cy and safety heavily depends on the clinical experiences and skills of the acupuncturists. Some herbal therapies and an- tioxidants demonstrate a trend toward some clinical efficacy. A few therapies, including spiruline, butterbur, phototherapy and acu- point herbal patching hold some promise. Herbal medicine, though is widely used for treating AR in China and Asia, is not yet qualified and recommended by the inter- national peers since large studies with appropriate randomization, blinding and control are lacking. Tea therapy is becoming an easy to take self-care method for AR patients in Asia. Japanese green tea with methylated catechin as an active ingredient has been sug- gested beneficial for AR patients sensitised to cedar by relieving symptoms, improving quality of life, and by reducing peripheral eosinophil as well. In conclusion, the popularity of CAM among the general public Figure 2 Acupuncturist in practice at AR clinic Beijing Tongren Hospital, China. Figure 1 CAM classifications. CAM comprises 5 domains: alternative medical systems, biologically based therapies, manipulative therapies, mind-body therapies, and energy therapies. The alternative medical system involves whole medical systems that are built on other theories and practices including acupuncture, Ayurveda, homeopathic treatment, and naturopathy. Manipulative therapies include chiropractic care and massage. Mind-body therapies use a variety of techniques designed to enhance the mind's capacity to affect bodily function and symptoms and include biofeedback, meditation, guided imagery, progressive relaxation, deep breathing, hypnosis, yoga, Tai Chi, Qi-gong, Reiki, and prayer. The biologically based therapies use substances found in nature, such as herbs, foods, and vitamins and include megavitamin therapy, various diet-based therapies, folk medicine, chelation therapy, and herbal medicines.3 Energy therapies are essentially made up of biofield therapies that are intended to affect energy fields that purportedly surround and penetrate the human body, whereas bioelectromagnetic based therapies involve the unconventional use of electromagnetic fields.

PATHOGENIC MECHANISMS The key features of AERD are the intense eosinophilic infiltration of the upper and lower airway mu - cosa and the refractory nature to routine pharmacological treat - ment.

It is a diagnosis of exclusion and not a distinct nosologic entity. A number of syndromes have been defined on the basis of clinical characteristics (Table 1), but the pathophysiologic mechanisms behind most of these syndromes have not been elucidat - ed. Infectious rhinitis, including the common cold, and chronic rhinosi - nusitis are generally not considered under the umbrella of NAR. When all syndromes are consid - ered, close to 50% of patients, who complain of chronic or epi - sodic nasal symptoms fall under the NAR category. The relative prevalence of NAR, compared to allergic rhinitis (AR), increases with age. Idiopathic rhinitis is the most common NAR syndrome. Patients with NAR can present with the full constellation of rhi - nitis symptoms, including rhinor - rhea, nasal congestion, posterior nasal drainage, local pruritus and sneezing, but the latter two are less prominent, compared to AR. Also, conjunctival symptoms and asthma co-morbidity are less com - mon in NAR. Another difference between AR and NAR is that pa -NONALLERGIC RHINITIS 2 KEY MESSAGES tients with the latter condition have lower prevalence of family history of rhinitis or asthma. How - ever, none of these differences can be used as a reliable diagnostic characteristic for NAR. The only diagnostic approach to NAR is the exclusion of allergy either through skin testing or allergen-specific serum IgE measurements. Even when skin testing is negative and allergen-specific serum IgE is un - detectable or very low, the possi - bility exists that local production of IgE at the nasal mucosa may be responsible for a patient's condi - tion. In this instance, and as long as a nasal allergen challenge confirms it, the diagnosis of local allergic rhi - nitis (LAR) can be given. Ongoing debate as to the prevalence of LAR and the fact that LAR responds well to conventional AR treatment makes it difficult to recommend routine nasal allergen challenge for the differential diagnosis of NAR. Management of NAR is summa - rized in Table 1. For syndromes in which the etiology is known (e.g. drug-induced rhinitis), removal of the offending agent is the most logical and effective intervention. In the case of idiopathic rhinitis, treatment should aim towards controlling symptoms since cur - ing the condition is not an option at this point. Azelastine, an intra - nasal antihistamine, or intranasal corticosteroids should be tried first; intranasal capsaicin may be used in some specialized centers. For patients with excessive rhin - orrhea, intranasal ipratropium can offer adequate relief.

LAR is a newly described phenotype of allergic rhinitis (AR) that may starts early in life and persists throughout the years, with a tendency towards clinical worsening and the development of asthma. It is a common respira - tory disease, affecting patients from different countries, ethnic groups and ages, with impairment of the quality of life and frequent association to conjunctivitis and asthma. Every physician can see patients with LAR every day dur - ing practice and should be pre - pared to differentiate these pa - tients from non-AR. Immunologically the nasal muco - sa inflammation of LAR patients presents a Th2 cytokine profile with local production of sIgE and increased levels of eosinophils, mast-cells and T cells.

The diagnosis of LAR is based on a clinical history of allergen induced rhinitis symptoms in patients with negative SPT and undetectable se - rum sIgE followed by the demon - stration of an allergic response to aeroallergens by NAPT and/or the detection of nasal sIgE (Figure 3). A detailed clinical history is cru - cial for identifying patients with LAR. The majority of patients are non-smoking young women, who have moderate to severe rhinitis associated with conjunctivitis and asthma. The onset of the disease in childhood and a family history of atopy are also common in LAR (Table 1). The NAPT is the gold standard for the diagnosis of LAR. It is safe, sensitive, specific, and reproducible, although time-con - suming. Fortunately, a new pro - tocol for NAPT with multiple aeroallergens in one session has shortened the diagnosis.

Local allergic rhinitis241GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION F - Allergic rhinitis - Special considerations Several conditions that are mimicking allergic rhinitis (AR), such as chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), are partly associated with rhinitis symptoms The prevalence of rhinitis symptoms or skin prick test positi vity are high, which might lead to delay in diagnosing a condition mimicking AR Some conditions mimicking AR need fast detection and treatment such as nasal foreign body, tumor and cerebrospina l fluid leakageSeveral conditions mimick aller - gic rhinitis (AR) (Table 1). The in - flammation of the nasal mucosa may or may not associate these conditions. Rhinitis is a prevalent disorder, whereas some mimick - ing conditions are rare. This may cause delayed diagnosis of the mimicking disorders. Inflammation close to the nasal cavity usually leads to inflamma - tion of the mucosa. Exam - ples include rhinosinusitis, inflam - mation of the oral cavity, such as dental caries and periodontal disease, rare infections such as tu - berculosis, fungal sinusitis, Lyme disease, meningitis and as Wegen - er\u00b4s granulomatosis and Sjogren's syndrome. In children, the most common disorders mimicking rhi - nitis are adenoid hypertrophy and intranasal foreign body. Sniffling, a habit rhinitis may de - velop in children after a cold or other irritant. These rhinitis symp - toms disappear during sleep. Dys - function of autonomous nervous system may lead to rhinitis. Psy - chosocial stress may affect rhinitis via the neuro-endocrine system. Depression and other psychiatric disorders may generate or modify rhinitis symptoms.CONDITIONS MIMICKING ALLERGIC RHINITIS 4 KEY MESSAGES Tumors as choanal atresia, primary ciliary dyskinesia or cystic fibrosis are rarely associated with rhinitis symptoms. It is important to avoid delayed diagnosis of benign and malignant tumors. Treatment-re - sistant or unilateral rhinitis symp - toms should raise suspicion of a tumour. Such tumors include in - lymphoma, tumors irritat - ing trigeminal nerve, and central lesions. Structural abnormalities, such as nasal septum deviation, hyper - trophic inferior turbinate and val - vular insufficiency, often exist to - gether with rhinitis. Spontaneous or traumatic defect of the skull base may cause cerebrospinal rhi - norrhea. Head and facial pain, headache and decreased olfaction are im - portant signs in the differential diagnosis between AR and chron - ic rhinosinusitis. Other important signs to exclude mimickers are muco-purulent discharge, na - sal bleeding, systemic symptoms such as low grade fever and ma - laise, severe and treatment resist - ant rhinitis symptoms or unilateral symptoms. In conclusion, several rhini - tis-mimicking conditions may ex - ist with or without inflammation of the nasal mucosa. Their early detection will essentially improve health.

Organ lateralit y defects occur in ~50% of cases Respiratory and nasal symptoms typically start in infancy There is no single 'gold standard' diagnostic test. Patients require referral to highly specialised centres where a pane l of complimentary sophisticated investigations is available The evidence base for treating PCD is limited, and approach is largely based on local experiencePrimary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare, genetically heterogeneous recessive of biogenesis, structure and/or function of motile cilia. Ciliated epithelial cells line the airways, nasal and sinus cavities and Eustachian tube. In healthy individuals, mucociliary clearance (MCC) occurs as cilia beat in a co - ordinated pattern, propelling mu - cus to the oropharynx where it can be swallowed (Figure 1). Impaired MCC in patients with PCD is a con - sequence of abnormal ciliary beat function, which is usually but not always associated with abnormal ciliary axoneme structure as seen with transmission electron micros - copy (TEM) (Figure 2). Mutations in over 30 genes, accounting for 65% of cases, have been pub - lished to date. Estimates of prevalence vary widely due to the broad range of non-specific clinical symptoms, variation of mutations in different populations and under-diagnosis. It has been estimated that PCD occurs in approximately 1:10,000 Europeans, and is higher in certain consanguineous populations. SYMPTOMS OF PCD Clinicians should refer patients with symptoms suggestive of PCD (Table 1) to a specialist diagnostic PRIMARY CILIARY DYSKINESIA 5 KEY MESSAGES centre. Early onset of daily res - piratory symptoms is a key feature of PCD. Patients typically present as neonates with respiratory dis - tress, which may range from mild transient tachypnoea to respirato - ry failure requiring prolonged ven - tilatory support. Neonatal rhinitis is also common. A persistent wet cough and recurrent respiratory infections continue throughout childhood and adulthood, often with exacerbations during infec - tions. Bronchiectasis can present in infancy and is almost invariable by adulthood, predominantly af - fecting lower and middle lobes. Most patients have persistent rhi - nitis, and radiographic evidence of chronic pan-sinusitis is apparent in childhood. Serous otitis media often fluctuates and frequently is associated with transient im - paired hearing that rarely evolves into permanent hearing loss. The structure of sperm flagella is simi - lar to the ultrastructure of cilia, ac - counting for male infertility, which is common in PCD. Dysfunction of nodal cilia, important for left- right asymmetry during embryon - ic development, accounts for situs inversus in 50% and situs ambigu - ous in ~10% of patients.

Performance and interpretation of these tests is not straightforward and should be conducted in cen - tres with extensive experience of normal and abnormal findings. MANAGEMENT There is a lack of evidence for the optimal management of PCD with no long-term randomised trials of treatment. As a result, patient care is usually based local expe - rience with other diseases (eg. cystic fibrosis or sinus disease) de - spite differing underlying patho - physiology. Specialists agree that multi-disciplinary care, with an ag - gressive approach to airway clear - ance and management of infec - tions is important for prognosis. However, wide variations in ap - proach to specific treatment exist, for example ventilation tubes are commonly used in some countries to manage serous otitis media. KEY REFERENCES 1.

A subgroup of pollen allergic pa - tients, are sensitized to profilin (a pan-allergen present in all veg - etables), and are prone to suffer from OAS. These patients are fre - quently encountered in areas with intense grass pollinization. In Northern and Central Europe, birch pollen allergic patients may develop OAS with symptoms in - duced by apple, hazelnut, kiwi - fruit, pear, carrot, celery and raw potato. In the Mediterranean area, pollen allergic patients may expe - rience OAS with fruits of Rosace- ae family (peach, apricot, plum, strawberry, cherry, nectarine, pear, apple) (Figure 1). Sometimes, patients allergic to nuts, legumes, animal foods such as cow's milk, egg, fish and shellfish can suffer OAS. The observed cross-reactivity between pollen and plant foods causing OAS can be correlated with sensitization to a small num - ber of well known allergens (Table 1).

For melon and banana allergy profilin sensitiza - tion is the predominant sensitizer. In contrast, for the Mediterranean Rosaceae fruit allergy, sensitiza - tion to profilin may account for OAS linked symptoms, while for more severe food allergy symp - toms the non-specific lipid trans - fer proteins are the main inducers allergens. Many raw plant foods contain allergens belonging to these three pan-allergen groups. Normally the patient's sensitiza - tion profile follows the geographi - cal distribution mentioned above.The symptoms of OAS include pruritus, tingling, and erythema or angioedema of the lips, tongue, palate and throat. Sometimes, pruritus appears in the ears or tightness in the throat is present. Symptoms appear within 15 min - utes after ingestion of foods, nor - mally fresh fruits or vegetables, and are usually mild and disappear spontaneously without any kind of treatment. Occasionally, OAS may be the first symptom of other food al - lergy manifestations (cutaneous, digestives, respiratory), even ana - phylaxis.TABLE 1 Difference between basophils and mast cells PR10 associated food allergies Profilin associated food allergies Rosaceae Apple Mal d 1 Apple Mal d 4 Peach Pru p 1 Peach Pru p 4 Cherry Pru av 1 Cherry Pru av 4 Pear Pyr c 1 Pear Pyr c 4 Apiaceae Carrot Dau c 1 Carrot Dau c 4 Celeriac Api g 1 Celeriac Api g 4 Corylaceae Hazelnut Cor a 1.04 Hazelnut Cor a 2 Others Kiwifruit Act d 8 Kiwifruit Act d 9 Peanut Ara h 8 Peanut Ara h 5 Soybean Gly m 4 Soybean Gly m 3 Melon Cuc m 2 Orange Cit s 2 Diagnosis of OAS is based on case history, skin prick testing prefer - ably performed as prick to prick with raw food sources, and deter - mination of specific IgE by in vitro tests. Assessment of sensitization patterns to inhalant allergens/ pollens can be helpful. Compo - nent resolved diagnosis to pan-al - lergens (Bet v 1, Bet v 2, Pru p 3) could provide valuable additional information. If the patient's his - tory is unclear, a mucosal and/or oral challenge test should be per - formed, especially for patients at risk to develop severe food allergy symptoms such as anaphylaxis. An elimination diet of the causa - tive food is recommended based on conclusive diagnosis, discrim - inating between sensitization patterns with and without clinical symptoms. Dietetic counseling should be offered to the patient how to avoid the incriminating food and if necessary to supple - ment with vitamins. Usually no symptomatic treatment is re - quired for OAS. Symptoms may improve with pollen allergen im - munotherapy, but no solid clinical evidence is available. KEY REFERENCES 1.

ATLAS RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION F - Allergic rhinitis - Special considerations Non-allergic persistent rhinitis is a frequent finding in s ystemic mastocytosis Nasal itching, sneezing, and rhinorrhoea are the predominant nasal symptoms in this patient group The level of nasal tryptase correlates strongly with the ma in symptoms and could link up the individual local mast cell b urden with the individual nasal complaints Based on the significance of this mastocytosis-associated symptom complex and elevated nasal tryptase levels, this defined mastocytosis mast cells (MC) that causes patho - logical accumulation of mast cells in various tissues, which results in a multitude of clinical symptoms due to MC mediator release. Nasal complaints in SM have been de - scribed in previous studies as the most frequent allergy-suggesting symptoms. Evidence of allergy could only be found in approxi - mately one half of the patients. Therefore, non-allergic rhinitis symptoms in SM patients have been assumed to be due to an in - creased nasal mast cell burden. To prove this hypothesis, we investi - gated whether nasal complaints in non-allergic SM patients are cor - related with objective measures of nasal mast cell burden. Eleven adult patients with systemic mas - tocytosis underwent a compre - hensive rhinologic work-up. All patients fulfilled the clinical ARIA criteria for rhinitis. The allergo - logic work-up included skin prick testing, testing for serum specif - ic IgE, determination of tryptase levels (serum and nasal secretion), and nasal provocation testing. Ten out of eleven SM patients with clinical persistent allergic rhinitis were found to be non-allergic.NON-ALLERGIC, University Hospital Oslo, NorwayMatthias F. Kramer Ludwig-Maximilian University Munich, Germany The clinical symptom pattern in SM patients with non-allergic persistent rhinitis was quite in contrast with the usually predomi - nant symptoms in persistent aller - gic rhinitis (AR): nasal obstruction was almost negligible, while itching, sneez - ing, and rhinorrhea were the predominant symptoms in this pa - tient group. All three predominant symp - toms were strongly correlated with the nasal tryptase level, but not with the lev - el of serum tryptase (Figure 1 and Table 1). The level of na -sal tryptase correlated strongly with the above mentioned main symptoms and provided the link between the individual local mast cell burden and the individual nasal complaints.

The clinically relevant complex of nasal complaints are characterized by: 1) Persistent non-allergic nasal complaints, such as watery rhi -norrhea, sneezing, and itching. 2) Elevated nasal tryptase as an objective measure.

WRR can be further classified into occupational rhinitis (OR) and work-exacerbated rhini - tis (WER) (Figure 1). OR is defined as rhinitis triggered by a specific substance or exposure encoun - tered in the work environment. Reactive upper airways dysfunc - tion syndrome (RUDS), a non-al - lergic form of OR, is induced by accidental exposure to high levels of irritants or chemical fumes in the workplace. OR should be dis - tinguished from WER, a preexist - ing rhinitis condition (e.g. allergic rhinitis), that is worsened by expo - sures in the work environment. OR may be due to both allergic and non-allergic mechanisms. It is most often associated with allergic sen - sitization to high molecular weight (HMW) protein allergens. Less commonly, low molecular weight (LMW) chemical sensitizers can form haptens with respiratory pro - teins and elicit typical allergic rhino - conjunctivitis symptoms at work. Allergic OR is characterized by nasal and ocular symptoms due to OCCUPATIONAL IRRITANT AND ALLERGIC RHINITIS 8 KEY MESSAGES Occupational irritant and allergic rhinitisan agent in the workplace, which has induced IgE-mediated sensi - tization. Development of allergic OR symptoms may be preceded by a latency period of exposure of months to years. Demonstra - tion of allergic sensitization is necessary to confirm allergic OR by a positive skin prick test and/ or elevated serum-specific IgE to the suspect workplace allergen(s). A few reactive chemicals, such as the acid anhydrides and platinum salts, have the capacity to hap - tenize, forming allergenic epitopes and specific IgE responses. After a latency period of exposure to these chemicals, affected workers develop IgE-mediated OR and oc - cupational asthma symptoms. RUDS, a phenotype of non-aller - gic OR, is chronic rhinitis related to an acute exposure to a chem -ical irritant or combustion prod - ucts. RUDS is not preceded by a latency period. Nasal pathology in RUDS is characterized by fo cal epithelial desquamation, glan - dular hypertrophy, lymphocytic infiltrates, and sensory nerve fib - er proliferation. Substance P re - leased from sensory nerves, and not histamine, is the hypothesized as the major mediator involved. Risk factors for development of OR include level and length of exposure, atopy, and smoking. Occupational asthma (OA) and OR are closely associated and coexist 76% to 92% of the time. OR symptoms typically precede those of OA in workers exposed to HMW agents or LMW agents. A diagnosis of OR can be estab - lished by a consistent medical J. Wesley Sublett James L.

Typical rhinitis and eye symptoms exacerbated by the work environ - ment and resolving over week - ends and/or during vacations are highly consistent with allergic OR. Patients presenting with rhinitis symptoms at work should be eval - uated for non-work-related aller - gic rhinitis caused by common en - vironmental allergens, which may be confused with OR, but is more consistent with nonspecific WER. An accurate diagnosis of OR and the ability to distinguished it from WER may have important medico - legal consequences. The principles of management of WRR follow the same principles as for allergic rhinitis: avoidance of exposure, pharmacothera - py and allergen immunotherapy (AIT). Steps to modify the work - place could include: improved ventilation to remove offending exposures, using less hazardous materials, and creating closed-cir - cuit manufacturing processes. Workers should be supplied with high-efficiency personal respira - tors. Nasal steroids are first line therapy for persistent symptoms. Antihistamines are used for inter - mittent symptoms or as ancillary agents to nasal steroids. AIT can be considered in patients with OR who fail pharmacotherapy and cannot avoid the causative aller - gen. Due to the limited availability of commercial allergen extracts for AIT for many forms of allergic OR, indications for AIT are limited.KEY REFERENCES 1. Siracusa A, Desrosiers M, Marabi - ni A.

As this population continues to increase, healthcare professionals will need to address the growing number of elderly with allergic rhinitis (AR). In 2005, the prevalence of AR in the US for ages 65-75 was 7.8%; over 75 was 5.4%. By 2013, Swiss aged 60+ had an atopic rate of 26% for men and 18% for women; AR rates of 13% and 15% respec - tively. In Poland (2013), similar percentages were found for atopy (26.7%), seasonal AR (12.6%), and perennial AR (17.1%). Understanding the pathophys - iology of AR in the aging nose is important to properly manage the condition and its deleterious affects on quality of life. With in - creasing age, the nose undergoes changes in its structural compo - nents. These normal aging pro - cesses of the nose can manifest as rhinologic dysfunction and result in symptoms of postnasal drip - ping, nasal drainage, sneezing, and olfactory loss (Table 1). In geriatric individuals without atopic condi - tions, total and specific IgE pro - ductions are reduced. However, this is not the case in elderly pa -ALLERGIC RHINITIS IN THE ELDERLY 9 KEY MESSAGES Allergic rhinitis in the elderlytients with atopic conditions, and serum IgE levels stay increased into advanced age. It is important, therefore, to assess elderly pa - tients for AR if their history and physical examination findings are consistent with the disease. Clinical evaluation of older pa - tients with AR should begin with a complete history. Physical ex - amination is also essential and includes assessment of nasal pa - tency, turbinates, straightness of septum, signs of inflammation, and presence of polyps. In addi - tion to the normal changes pro - duced by aging, rhinitis in the aging nose may also include vaso - motor, primary atrophic, and gus -tatory rhinitis. If the history and physical exam raises a suspicion for AR, in vivo (skin prick test) or in vitro tests may be utilized. Meas - ures of allergic sensitization, such as those seen in in vivo or in vitro studies, decline with age; howev - er, there is a robust association between allergic sensitization and allergic disease in the elderly.

Patients with AR often report prominent sneez - ing, nasal pruritus, and watery rhi - norrhea, and some have concom - itant ocular itching and irritation. Common triggers for allergic rhini - tis include dust mites, animal dan - ders, molds, and pollens (Table 1). If allergy testing was not per - formed in the past, we recom - mend that this evaluation should be deferred until after delivery, since skin testing has the poten - tial to induce systemic allergic reactions in highly sensitive pa - tients. Although skin testing is more sensitive for the diagnosis of sensitivities to inhaled allergens, in vitro tests for allergen-specific IgE are widely available and may be used for the diagnosis of AR during pregnancy. TREATMENT The mainstays of therapy for AR in pregnant patients are avoidance of triggers, oral antihistamines and intranasal glucocorticoids (Ta - ble 2). No important differences in efficacy or safety appear to exist between the various intranasal glucocorticoid preparations. Some clinicians choose budesonide, if MANAGEMENT OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS DURING PREGNANCY 10 KEY MESSAGES Management of allergic rhinitis during pregnancystarting intranasal glucocorticoids for the first time during pregnan - cy, since it is classified as a catego - ry B drug based on reassuring data available for its use as an inhaled preparation. Pregnant women who require antihistamines for AR should generally be treated with a second generation agent such as loratadine (10 mg once daily) or cetirizine (10 mg daily), since these drugs have reassuring ani - mal and human data, are less se - dating, and have fewer anticholin - ergic side effects compared with first generation agents. Intranasal cromolyn sodium may be considered a first-line therapy for mild AR in pregnancy because of its excellent safety profile. De - congestants are vasoconstrictors that are available as both oral preparations and nasal sprays. Decongestant nasal sprays can be used very briefly (e.g., three days or less) for temporary relief of se - vere nasal congestion, and some reassuring human data exist for use of intranasal oxymetazoline during pregnancy. However, as noted above, patients should be warned about dependence with prolonged use of decongestant nasal sprays. Oral decongestants are probably best avoided alto - gether during the first trimester because of a possible increased risk of a rare birth defect, gastro - schisis KEY REFERENCES 1.

While most experience the typical sneezing, itching, watery rhinorrhoea and nasal blockage (Figure 1), other children and ad - olescents may present atypically with cough or snoring, due to co - morbidities. AR impacts negative - ly on physical, social and psycho - logical well-being of children and adolescents. As well as direct im - pact of symptoms, indirect effect of sleep disturbance gives daily fatigue and results in impaired school performance. The differential diagnosis of rhi - nitis is wide (Figure 2), commonly it needs to be differentiated from infectious rhinitis, typically caused by a viral infection. Less common is non-allergic, non-infectious rhi - nitis, usually due to irritants such as cigarette smoke or pollution in this age group. Similar symptoms may occur with other conditions such as adenoidal hypertrophy, septal deviation and nasal polyps. Examination by anterior rhinosco - py and allergy tests may help to substantiate a diagnosis of AR. A wide range of allergens drive AR. Outdoor allergens, such as tree or grass pollens, are typically associ - ated with seasonal AR while indoor ALLERGIC RHINITIS IN CHILDREN 11 KEY MESSAGES Allergic rhinitis in childrenones, such as house dust mite and animal dander, are usually associ - ated with perennial AR. Especially in new onset AR, skin prick testing and specific IgE may be negative to the likely allergen. Avoidance of relevant allergens, where possible may be helpful for AR. Oral and intranasal antihistamines and nasal corticosteroids are both appropriate for first-line treatment of AR in children, although the lat - ter are more effective (Figure 3). Once-daily forms of corticoster - oids are preferred given their im - proved safety profile. Potentially useful add-on therapies for AR in children include oral leukotriene receptor antagonists, short bursts of a nasal allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is effective for AR in children and teenagers. There is also some evidence to suggest that AIT may prevent the progression of AR to asthma. Compliance with AR ther - apy has not been well studied in children and teenagers. It is likely to be suboptimal, particularly for nasal sprays or AIT, and deserves more attention.

However, it has been shown to significantly affect their qual - ity-of-life and performance. The prevalence of rhinitis in athletes is particularly high and appears to be on a continuous increase (Table 1), with ranging prevalence in various studies depending on the criteria used for diagnosis. Athletes from winter, aquatic and endurance sport disciplines are more likely to have symptoms. Among different phenotypes described (vasomo - tor, infectious, traumatic, neutro - philic, NARES) the allergic variant is the most frequently observed. In our recent study performed in 659 Italian Olympic athletes, al - lergic rhinitis (AR) was found to be present in 26.2% of subjects. Such increased occurrence has been reported to be ascribed to a global influence of the intense physical exercise on the immune system, inducing a transient im - mune deviation with a prevalent Th2 response, as well as to its di - rect trigger effect on target organs (Figure 1).

Preventive meas - ures should also be undertaken to limit exposure to environmental factors (air humidity and temper - ature, content in pollutants and allergens responsible for sensi - tization in allergic athletes) that may trigger symptoms and affect performances during training and competition. In view of this, lo - cal pollen counts and forecasts should always be made available in advance to allergic athletes, their coaches and medical staff. KEY REFERENCES 1.

It is a region surrounding the Equator, limited in latitude by the Tropic of Cancer at 23\u00b0 26 16 (or 23.4378\u00b0) N and the Tropic of Capricorn at 23\u00b0 26 16 (or 23.4378\u00b0) S (Figure 1) with high biodiversity, variable climate, and abundant rainfall all year round with mean tempera - tures above 18\u00b0C. More than half of the World's population lives in the tropics. EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS Allergic rhinitis (AR) incidence in the tropical areas is influenced by the environment, infections, and allergens. The prevalence of AR in the tropics is as high as in other regions. Anticipated protec - tive factors, such as low hygienic conditions, do not seem to confer protection in poor communities. In Africa allergic rhinoconjuncti - vitis (ARC) has a prevalence be - tween 7.2 and 27.3%. Latin Amer - ica, encompassing the territories from Mexico to Paraguay and Bra - zil, has the greatest concentration of tropical rainforest in tropical countries, with temperatures be - tween 20\u00b0C and 34\u00b0C, and hu - midity between 77 and 88%. Latin RHINITIS IN A TROPICAL ENVIRONMENT 13 KEY MESSAGES America is one of the regions with the highest prevalence of AR; ac - cording to ISAAC phase III, the prevalence is 37.6%. Sensitization to mites constitutes the most important risk factor for AR in the tropics. Humidity facili - tates the proliferation of mites and perennial exposure to high allergen concentrations. In Venezuela 97.1 % of AR patients are sensitized to mites (Table 1). In Mexico, 56% of patients are sensitized to mites, but this rate reaches 87% in trop - ical regions (Figure 2). Cockroach allergen sensitisation represents another risk factor. In Caracas the rate of sensitisation to cockroach allergen is 83.1%, being more common in low socioeconomic groups. Allergy to cockroaches in Latin America is likely related to availability of food, humidity and heat, poor hygiene and ventilation, and low educational levels. In the tropics there are only two seasons. Pollen concentrations are not as high as in temperate climates. Bermuda grass ( Cynodon dactylon associ - ated AR in Africa, and Maize the pollens found in significant quantities. Mould spores are present all year round.

Although there are variations among countries, most tropical countries are poor, and patients do not have access to medical assistance. Thus, although AR is frequent in the tropics it is often underdiagnosed and undertreat - ed. Medical management is insuf - ficient and medications are not available or unaffordable. In many countries allergology is not recog - nized, or the number of allergists is low. In consequence, most pa - tients are treated by primary care physicians. Potential risk factors for AR in this region are related 264GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION F - Allergic rhinitis - Special considerations Rhinitis in a tropical environment Figure 2 Allergen sensitivity throughout the Mexican Republic.

In summary, weak economies and insufficient resources interfere with care for AR in tropical settings. PREVENTION AND CONTROL The number of patients undergo - ing allergy testing in the tropics is low, and the utilization of allergen immunotherapy is nearly absent. The cost of medication, dose fre - quency, fear of adverse effects, and low efficacy determine low treatment compliance. A higher number of physicians trained in allergology are needed in order to meet the increasing demand. KEY REFERENCES 1. Neffen HE.

It focus - es on the assessment and treat - ment of AR based on severity as assessed by simple quality of life (QoL) measurements. Although the treatment guidelines are now well established, treated patients may report poor levels of satisfaction and continue to be undertreated and at risk for acute exacerbations, resulting in reduced productivity at work, school performance and QoL, triggering increased health- care costs and the use of oral cor - ticosteroids. The level of AR' con - trol is often overestimated by both patients and physicians, resulting in failure to make the necessary adjustments to medication. Thus, a measure of AR control should be used to evaluate treatment out - comes and simplify monitoring. As implement for asthma manage - ment by the the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines, the SEVERITY AND CONTROL IN ALLERGIC RHINITIS 14 KEY MESSAGES generalization of the term \"con - trol\" is now being considered for the management of patients with AR, chronic rhinosinusitis, chronic urticaria and atopic dermatitis. There is currently no single defini - tion of AR control, since its deter - mination depends on the variables taken into account by the different available tools. As a consequence, there is no universally agreed indi - cation that AR control should be measured directly. Rhinitis control is essentially \"absence of symp - toms\". Most of the control tools developed so far focus on objec - tive and subjective measurements of daily or nocturnal nasal and ocu - lar symptoms (congestion, rhinor - rhea, sneezing, pruritus, post-na - sal drip), symptom magnitude (i.e., the patients' perception of how bothersome their symptoms are), patient-reported metrics of QoL (i.e., impairment in sleep or daily activities) and satisfaction, and some objective measurements (e.g., peak nasal inspiratory flow, rhinomanometry, increased use of rescue medication). Many in - struments, such as The Control of Allergic Rhinitis and Asthma Test (CARAT), Rhinitis Control As - sessment Test (RCAT), The Aller - gic Rhinitis Control Test (ARCT), a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and other new questionnaires requir - ing validation have appeared and have been used in the assessment of the patient's clinical symptoms (Table 1). New approaches based on disease control are now emerg - ing (Figure 1). They will need to be evaluated prospectively.Pascal Demoly University Hospital of Montpellier Montpellier, France Severity and control in allergic rhinitis266GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION F - Allergic rhinitis - Special considerations KEY REFERENCES 1.

Severity and control in allergic rhinitis268GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION F - Allergic rhinitis - Special considerations Better management of allergic diseases needs a sharpened understanding of disease heterogeneity and mechanisms in relation to clinically significant outcomes Phenotypes describing observable clinical and morpholog ic characteristics and unique responses to treatment have bee n developed; however they do not relate to disease mechanisms Recently, extended heterogeneous and disease-related metabolic, inflammatory, immunological, and remodeling pathways have been described, and reproducible patterns are defined as disease endotypes An endotype might consist of several intricated mechanism s that cannot be clearly separated into \"pure single molecul ar mechanism\" thus being a \"complex endotype\" The Th2 type inflammation or aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease can be defined as complex endotypes The description of an endotype relies on biomarkers, which can be the signature of a complex underlying pathway or a key- molecule for a role in a particular disease endotypePHENOTYPES AND ENDOTYPES The heterogeneity of allergic dis - eases in relation to clinically signifi - cant outcomes, including response to treatment has been established beyond any doubt. At first, pheno - types describing clinical and mor - phologic characteristics as well as unique responses to treatment have been developed to address the complexities of the disease. Several allergic rhinitis (AR) phe - notypes can be described based on the predominant symptom (\"runners\" vs. \"blockers\"), occur - rence of symptoms (\"seasonal\" vs of sensitisa - tion (\"mono-\" vs. \"polysensitised\") severity or response to treatment. The phenotype driven approach of AR is already in place for many years and acknowledged by the international guidelines such as ARIA, since we tend to use as first line treatment nasal steroids for blockers and antihistamines or an - ticholinergics for runners, and we treat AR according to its severity. Even the elicitation of symptoms can separate different clusters of AR patients: for example the aer - oallergen challenge chamber (ACC) exposure dichotomises patients into low versus high level of symp -PHENOTYPES AND ENDOTYPES OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS 15 KEY MESSAGES toms developing slow or fast while natural exposure versus ACC di - vides patients into concordant re - sponders to both type of exposure or discordant responders, with a greater symptom score in the nat - ural season. Phenotypes may be clinically rel - evant in terms of presentation, triggers, and treatment response, but do not necessarily relate to or give insights into the underly - ing pathological mechanism. For example, the recently described local allergic rhinitis is certain - ly an interesting AR phenotype posing several questions on the mechanisms involved in the lack of systemic atopy. For most of the allergic diseases extended heterogeneous disease-related inflammatory, immunological, and metabolic pathways have been described, and a reproducible un - derlying mechanism is defined as a disease endotype. Classifying Ioana Agache Transylvania University Brasov, Romania Phenotypes and endotypes of allergic rhinitis269GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION F - Allergic rhinitis - Special considerationsAR based on underlying patho - physiologic mechanisms, known as endotyping, offers a stratified approach for a better assessment of disease' epidemiology, genetic background and environmental risk factors, for the development of new targeted therapies and for a better selection of responders to targeted treatment. To become clinically relevant, the endotype should be related to validated biomarkers that corre - spond to the underlying mecha - nism. The purpose of the biomark - er is to identify disease endotype, predict onset and prognosis of a disease, measure exposure, mon - itor response to treatment and forecast unfavourable evolution. The biomarker can be the sig - nature of a complex underlying pathway or a key-molecule of a particular disease endotype. To further complicate the picture, the predictive value of the same biomarker is highly variable across age groups, disease severity and in relation to the outcome. The ideal biomarker should be path - way-specific, reproducible in the same individual and in an inde - pendent prediction cohort and usable as a diagnostic test (easily measurable and affordable). New strategies for discovery and vali - dation of biomarkers such as gene expression (microarrays) and om - ics provide combined signatures as per systems medicine. THE CONCEPT OF COMPLEX ENDOTYPES Allergic diseases, such as asthma, AR or atopic dermatitis, manifest as heterogeneous syndromes that cover a broad spectrum of complex genetic, inflammatory, metabolic and remodelling networks that lead to several pathogenetic pathways. Single molecular mechanism-linked endotypes can be defined for an allergic disease, however most al - lergic endotypes involve concomi - tantly several pathways. Examples of complex endotypes are Th2 inflammation or aspirin-exac - erbated respiratory disease. THE TYPE 2 COMPLEX ENDOTYPE The type 2 complex endotype in al - lergic diseases includes innate lym - phoid cells, T helper 2 cells, tissue eosinophilia and systemic and local IgE production. The IL-9/mast cell/ PGD2 pathway activation, Th1 or Th17 cells may add to the Th2-driv - en inflammation, with their role in apoptosis of the epithelium (Th1) and in promoting neutrophilic in - flammation (Th17). Further influ - ences added by the associ - ated microbiota (superantigens) or by activation of peculiar metabolic pathways such as the eicosanoid pathway in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease or the L-Arg/ ADMA or the lectin pathway in obesity (Figure 1). The type 2 inflammation is char - acterized by a high cellular plas - ticity that enables the cells to adapt to a specific inflammatory milieu. Innate cytokines such as IL-33 and TSLP modulate the mast cell phenotype, while type 2 cy - tokines influence permissiveness of epithelium for allergens and of the endothelium for the recruit - ment of inflammatory cells to in - flamed tissues and are involved in the production of mucus. The \"Holy Grail\" of endotyping is to pinpoint the essential nodes of the network that are unique for one endotype and relate to relevant clinical end-points such as disease severity or response to treatment. For Type 2 inflammation endotype, three such nodes can be described, each depicting a distinct subendo -type: the IL-5 pathway, the IL-4/IL- 13 pathway and the IgE pathway (Figure 1). These pathways can be demonstrated for allergic asthma, where targeted intervention and the fast development of biomark - ers allow such a separation. Since for AR the targeted treatment has not been fully developed one can just assume that given the simi - larities between the Th2-driven inflammation in the nasal and the bronchial mucosa and the well es - tablished systemic link between AR and asthma, the Th2 nasal en - dotype to behave similar to asth - ma. In addition, the well recognized link between rhinitis and asthma should be integrated and tackled within the framework provided by endotypes. Several biomarkers for Type 2 type inflammation have been de - scribed (Table 1). Each biomarker reflects a compartment or a path - way involved in type 2 inflamma - tion, related to Th2 cells and ILC2. For non-specific interventions, such as topical corticosteroids, all described biomarkers can be used to predict response. However, for more targeted interventions, such as anti-IL-5 or anti-IL-13, each of these Th2 or ILC2 biomarkers needs to be related to the specifi - cally targeted pathway. KEY REFERENCES et al.

Allergy / eotaxin271GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION F - Allergic rhinitis - Special considerations Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a systemic disease affecting not only the nasal function, but general well-being as well (hay 'fever') Patients frequently consider their condition as being part o f how they are, without seeking medical attention Automedication is common in patients with AR, resulting in adverse effects such as sedation from first generation antihistamines and rhinitis medicamentosa from misuse of topical vasoconstrictors As a chronic condition AR puts a considerable economic burde n on sufferers Allergen immunotherapy, subcutaneous or sublingual, can improve quality of life and reduce the economic burden of ARAllergic rhinitis (AR) is often con - sidered a local condition caused by an allergic reaction to inhalant allergens in the nose. However, in patients suffering from AR apart from local immunologic changes, also a deviation of the systemic immune response has been docu - mented. During allergen exposure serum levels of specific IgE, eosin - ophil-derived proteases and cy - tokines are all elevated. These are probably the cause of the feverish feeling and tiredness expressed by several patients, leading in the past to the term hay-fever. AR patients often accept their condition as being part of how they are and as such do not seek medical attention. Even less often advice from a specialist is sought. It is common that patients refer af - ter they have suffered from symp - toms for years, before visiting the physician. During peaks of symp - toms the burden of self-medica - tion is frequent, often in the form of first generation antihistamines, alone or in a cold-mix. When the main symptom is nasal obstruc - tion, the mostly used over the counter (OTC) medication is a top - ical vasoconstrictor. As such, AR affects the patient's well-being in several ways (Figure THE BURDEN OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS ON PATIENTS' QUALITY OF LIFE 16 KEY MESSAGES 1). Firstly, the local nasal condi - tions such as rhinorrhea, sneezing and pruritus are bothersome and can interfere with the social func - tioning of sufferers. At night, nasal obstruction reduces the quality of sleep and causes odynophagia in the morning, because of nocturnal oral respiration. Secondly, the sys - temic immunologic reactions give the patient a feeling of malaise and unwell being and in some cas - es even arthralgia has been doc - umented, especially in children. Thirdly, side effects of the OTC, self-prescribed medication poses more burden on the AR patient. The sedative effect of first gen - eration antihistamines can have deleterious consequences, be - cause it not only reduces school and work performance, but intake of first generation antihistamines has even been linked to car and plane accidents. Misuse of topi - cal decongestants in nasal sprays easily leads to a rebound nasal ob - struction and finally rhinitis me - dicamentosa. Measuring quality of life in pa - tients with allergic rhinitis has to take into account all these differ - ent aspects. As such, a generic health-related quality of life ques - tionnaire might not be the ideal instrument.

Many factors may negatively acc ount for patient adherence to treatment Adherence is a multidimensional phenomenon determined by the interplay of different factors. Hence, it is a dynamic process that varies over treatment duration Targeted management plans, based on patient's characteristi cs, symptoms, co-morbid conditions, and preferences, may increase adherence and patients' perception of symptom relief Education is a key factor in promoting adherence and providing the best care for the patients with AR. Additional research to determine the best methods for education delivery is neededCurrently, management plan of al - lergic rhinitis (AR) includes allergen avoidance, pharmacotherapy, aller - gen immunotherapy (AIT) and pa - tient's education. The management of AR, same as many chronic diseas - es, is affected by the adherence is - sues, since at least one-third of pa - tients may be non-adherent to their AR treatment regimen, and 40-80% of patients may discontinue the treatment after the first 6 weeks. Adherence is a multidimensional phenomenon, currently measured by variable methods. Figure 1 sum - marizes five dimensions of deter - minants for adherence, which may have also relevance for AR. There are very few data on the adherence to allergen avoidance measures, available only for house dust mites and indicating a great adherence rate, when encasings are provided without costs. In clin - ical trials involving both pharmaco - logical treatments and AIT, where patients are strictly monitored, the adherence is obviously much bet - ter compared to real life studies. Thus, for antihistamines, clinical trials report an overall long-term adherence of about 80%, where - as real-life studies suggest a rate of less than 50%, with one third of patients adapting or modifying ADHERENCE TO THE MANAGEMENT PLAN OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS 17 KEY MESSAGES the prescribed treatment. An easy schedule and different drug for - mulation as well as safety issues should be taken into consideration. For intranasal steroids (INS), low efficacy perception and bother - some adverse effects contribute to lack of satisfaction with treatment and discontinuation of treatment in AR patients. The compliance has been formally assessed mainly on the basis of patient's preference (i.e. INS smell, taste, type of for - mulation), the preference being in - versely correlated to the intensity of the sensorial attributes. The rate of adherence to AIT is currently low. Multiple predictors of non-ad - herence have been identified, in particular the inconvenience and the occurrence of side effects for subcutaneous AIT, while the per - ceived (vs. expected) efficacy and the costs seem to play a major role for the adherence to sublingual AIT. The reasons for non-adher - ence might differ between children and adults (Table 1). Therefore, the approach to AR management must be individual - ized, considering many variable factors, such as patients' age, fre - quency and severity of symptoms, degree of impairment of QOL, patient preferences, response, tolerability and compliance to pre - vious medications, presence of co-morbidities and costs.

Adherence to the management plan of allergic rhinitis276GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION F - Allergic rhinitis - Special considerations Rhinitis can be associated with significant psychological an d social burden How patients perceive their rhinitis can differ widely and often challenges the understanding of the disease by professionals Adopting a bio-psychosocial approach in the consultation ensures that the wider impacts of rhinitis are recognised, a nd can then be taken into account when advising and prescribing Patient's perceptions about their rhinitis appear to be independent of the severity and persistence of their dise ase, this may lead to under-diagnosis and under-treatmentILLNESS PERCEPTIONS Health psychologists have devel - oped models to help us understand how patient's perceptions about their illness links to the way they behave (e.g. self-care, medication adherence). A widely used model is the Leventhal's Common Sense Model of self-regulation, which provides a framework for under - standing how symptom-based and psychological factors com - bine to form patient's own mod - el of illness, and how this in turn influences their coping strategies and outcomes. The model, devel - oped in 1984, has been applied to many chronic illnesses (Figure 1), but only recently in rhinitis. One British study of adults with sea - sonal allergic rhinitis (AR) found two distinct groups of patients, those with negative beliefs about hay fever and its treatment (ap - proximately 40%), and those with more positive beliefs. Those with negative beliefs perceived control of their illness as minimal and their treatment ineffective. Eliciting patients' beliefs during the consultation can reveal as - sumptions that differ from those of the clinician and these patient perceptions need to be consid - ered when negotiating treatment ILLNESS PERCEPTION, MOOD AND COPING IN PATIENTS WITH RHINITIS 18 KEY MESSAGES plans. Interestingly, a recent Ital - ian study found patient percep - tions to be independent of sever - ity or persistence of rhinitis. The authors suggested this may ex - plain why AR is under-diagnosed and undertreated, even in its most severe forms. COPING Patients with rhinitis have to deal with multiple challenges; the feelings of having the disease (such as disappointment or an - ger), the symptoms of rhinitis, the need and costs of seeking health care and the inconvenience and side-effects of treatment. From the general literature it is known that patients cope with adversity in numerous ways, ranging from the passive (e.g. acceptance, dis - engagement) through to very ac - tive strategies, for example use of support (e.g. social, religious). Coping can be measured with validated questionnaires and in Braido's study the most frequent - ly used coping mechanisms were positive reinterpretation, taking action, planning, use of social sup - port and acceptance. These cop - ing mechanisms can all be encour - aged in the consultation (Table 1). MOOD Superficially rhinitis may be seen as a solely physical disorder; how - ever it is well documented that it also impacts on psychological wellbeing, sometimes referred to as the \"allergy blues\".

Jones Brighton and Sussex Medical School UK277GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION F - Allergic rhinitis - Special considerations Figure 1 Leventhal's Common Sense Model. This model is often used as a framework for examining individuals' beliefs about their illness and health behaviours. Leventhal suggested that patients form beliefs about their illness ( cognitive representations ) and emotional responses ( emotional representations ) to their illness and together these influence their coping strategies. The processing of the information feeds back, modifying the patient's beliefs and coping mechanisms. TABLE 1 Tips for helping patients cope with their rhinitis Learn to accept your illness - acceptance is often the starting point for action, individuals are then better placed to move on, to plan, to seek sup - port and do the things that can improve their quality of life Take action and be involved in your treatment - impact can be reduced by becoming actively involved in your care and establishing a good rapport with your health carers Planning - this can relate to avoiding the triggers and also planning the actions you want to take Seeking support - seek assistance, information and advice on what to do. Sources of advice are plentiful (e.g. books, internet, patient support groups) Reinterpretation of the situation - this is about viewing your rhinitis in a more positive light and looking for benefits in your situation (e.g. the things you have learnt or the people you have met).

Incorporating a holistic view in the consultation can ensure patient's wellbeing is addressed in its entirety. can interfere with sleep, and this can cause poor concentration and depression. There may also be a biological explanation; interest in this area was triggered by the observation that high tree pollen levels correlated with increased suicide rates. It has been hypoth - esised that it is the cytokine re - leased which affects brain func - tion, triggering sadness, malaise, poor concentration, and increased sleepiness. This association re - quires further exploration, but it supports the need to adopt a ho - listic approach (Figure 2), when managing patients with rhinitis, and being attentive to their mood and psychological well-being, re - ferring the patient to a mental health professional for evaluation if appropriate.

The sustained benefits of AIT can translate into significant c ost- savings over time Two systematic reviews concluded that both the sublingual an d the subcutaneous routes for AIT delivery are cost-effective compared with standard drug treatment with no strong evidence favoring a particular route The cost-effective time point was about 6 years after AIT initiation in one systematic review, but as early as 3 months in large retrospective claims analyses studiesAllergic respiratory diseases rep - resent some of the most common and costliest chronic conditions worldwide. Global estimates sug - gest that allergic rhinitis (AR) af - fects approximately 500 million people, with higher prevalence in westernized countries. Approxi - mately 113 million people in Eu - rope and 30 to 60 million in the United States (US) are affected by AR. Studies comparing AR prevalence in patient-reported questionnaires with subsequent clinically-confirmed AR, suggest AR is frequently underdiagnosed, often undertreated, and/or poor - ly controlled. In addition to sig - nificant patient discomfort, AR can be associated with a number of 'secondary' symptoms and co - morbid conditions, such as asth - ma, presenteeism, impaired sleep with subsequent daytime fatigue, otitis media, and sinusitis that sig - nificantly impair quality of life, and increase the direct and indirect costs of AR. The total indirect costs associated with AR can be considerable and may actually be greater than the direct costs. In addition to over- the-counter medications, indirect costs include lost work productiv - ity. The annual loss to employers PHARMACOECONOMICS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS 19 KEY MESSAGES related to untreated AR-related presenteeism has been estimated to be approximately \u20ac100 billion in Europe (2011 value). In a sur - vey of U.S. employees, the total annual cost of lost productivity at - tributable to AR was significantly higher than the cost for any other condition assessed including dia - betes and coronary heart disease. There are a number of second - ary outcomes assessed in ran - domized, controlled trials such as impact on quality of life via a validated questionnaire, but few studies directly assess economic outcomes. Cost comparisons can only be estimated by translating medication scores (use) and the secondary clinical outcomes re - ported (e.g., hospitalizations, or unscheduled clinic or emergency visits) into actual costs based on the reimbursement fees of that particular healthcare system. An - other limitation is that many do Linda Cox Nova Southeastern University Davie, USA Pharmacoeconomics of allergic rhinitis280GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION F - Allergic rhinitis - Special considerationsnot provide outcome information related to comorbid illnesses or the indirect costs of AR (e.g., last work days). The management of AR is multi - faceted and may include avoid - ance measures, pharmacothera - py, and allergen immunotherapy (AIT). Multiple controlled-trials and systematic reviews indicate the magnitude of AIT clinical ef - ficacy is generally superior to pharmacotherapy, with only nasal corticosteroids approaching the 20 to 30 percent improvement over placebo seen in most AIT trials. An additional consideration when evaluating the pharma - coeconomic of AR, is that allergy medications provide no sustained benefits after discontinuation. In contrast, AIT can provide symp - tomatic improvement during and years after discontinuation. Addi - tionally, AIT may prevent the pro - gression of the allergic rhinitis to asthma, which is a considerably more 'expensive' disease in terms of both costs and morbidity. The economic benefit of AIT over standard drug treatment (SDT) has been confirmed from sever - al different perspectives; soci - etal, healthcare system, patient and private 3rd party payer, or some combination of these per - spectives. This economic benefit would be even greater, if account - ing for the persistent clinical im - provement and preventive effect of AIT-outcomes that are not seen with SDT. One 6-year prospective study demonstrated 80% lower healthcare costs in the patients who received subcutaneous AIT (SCIT) compared with SDT, three years after the treatment discon - tinuation.

Currently, the cause of CRS remains unclear but researchers have proposed several mecha- nisms. In healthy people, the nose and sinuses are lined with epithe- lial cells and other specialized cells that form a mucosal barrier. This barrier serves to protect the un- derlying tissues from the millions of allergens, microbes, and par- ticulates inhaled regularly. Such inhaled particles can be trapped in mucus and cleared through the action of cilia on nasal epitheli- al cells that move mucus out of the airways. In CRS, the mucosal barrier can be defective (Figure 1). Epithelial cells do not function normally, leading to a weak and permeable barrier. This impaired barrier is exposed to more parti- cles and does not repair itself as well as a healthy barrier. There is increased thick mucus produc- tion in CRS that cannot be easily cleared away by nasal epithelial cilia. Some people with CRS have per- sistent growth of fungi or bacte- ria such as Staphylococcus aureus in their nose and sinuses. In some cases, the organism does not CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS - MECHANISMS 1 KEY MESSAGES cause significant damage to tis- sue. However, problems can occur if an immune response is mounted against the colonising organism or to the toxins it makes. This im- mune response can cause inflam- mation and damage to the sinus and nasal tissues and worsen CRS (Figure 2). There are many types of white blood cells that play a role in CRS inflammation. Special factors re- leased by epithelial cells and other cells can cause immune cells to migrate outside of blood vessels into the sinus and nasal tissue. Eosinophils, neutrophils, baso- phils, mast cells, innate lymphoid cells type-2, T cells, and B cells are elevated in CRS. These cells can be activated to release specific mediators that can recruit more immune cells, cause tissue injury, and perpetuate inflammation. Inflammation in CRS can lead to the dilation of nasal and sinus blood vessels, tissue swelling, and increased mucus production (Fig- ure 3). These features can produce common CRS symptoms including stuffy nose, runny nose, and sinus pressure. Finally, in certain types of CRS, nasal polyps can form which are not cancerous but are characterized by local swelling, fluid retention, and increased fi- brin deposition.

The triggering of these specific cells by allergens, viral, and microbial proteins may trigger the sy mptoms of rhinosinustitisMicrobial pattern recognition is a major function of the innate immune system mediated by a variety of cells in the tissues pre - dominately at the epithelial airway interface in the nose and sinuses. There are four types of receptor mechanisms activated in this kind of pattern recognition response (Table 1). The first involves mem - brane bound receptors, such as the Toll like receptors (TLR) and C-type lectin receptors, all of which are involved in immune cell activation, cytokine produc - tion and regulation and other mediator release. The second level response involves secreted membrane browned form of re - ceptors from microbial proteins and other agents. These would in - clude CD14 that binds endotoxin as does LPS-binding protein, and all of these secreted membrane browned material are potentially co-factors for TLR activation. The secreted forms of host defense in innate immunity involves the pro - duction of anti-microbial peptides including the defensins, celliicidin, dermicidin and the collectins, sur - factant proteins and C-reactive protein.

Once these innate processes are activat - ed, a variety of signaling pathways generated by the various recep - tors, membrane and cytosolic lead to a development of pro-inflamma - tory cytokines and other proteins that are involved not only in direct host defense, but also in the initi - ation and modulation of adaptive immunity, either locally within the submucosa, or within the draining lymphoid tissues (Figure 1).These immune responses depend on a wide variety of factors rang- ing from the microbiome identi- fied in the upper airway depend- ent on exposure and development of microbiological systems on oth- er surfaces including the skin and gut.

This increased mRNA activity can be correlated with excess protein of pro inflam- matory nature that would be gen- erated. Transcription factors, RNA binding proteins, and miRNA's in- fluence the mRNA output in terms of gene output, so those are im- portant regulatory factors. The innate immune system can be evaluated in a variety of pathway analysis that would identify po- tential pathway commons and/ or unique aspects of innate adap- tive immune interactions based on network evaluation of high throughput data such as after al- lergen exposure, during allergen immunotherapy, or under influen- za immunization and/or exposure to natural viruses. All of these activities across the respiratory upper airway epithelium can be assessed and measured. An iden- tification of new potential mecha- nisms for innate adaptive immune responses in CRS will be most in- teresting and identify important models that can be developed for understanding the framework of allergic disease mechanisms.

Although this interaction is not restricted to a mucosal Th2 bias, there is an association between S. aureus colonisation, formation of IgE antibodies to superanti- gens (SE-IgE) and allergic airway disease (Figures 1 and 2). There is evidence that allergic mucosal sites show a deficit in defense against S. aureus partially due to the alternative activation of mac- rophages (type 2 macrophages) in the upper and lower airways. Nasal colonisation with S. aureus is associated with increased risk of asthma prevalence, symptoms, and exacerbations in children and young adults. It has been recently speculated that the epidemic of S. aureus colonisation may drive the concurrent epidemic of asthma. As superantigens also stimulate B-cells and induce receptor re- vision and class switch recom- bination, an increased and often polyclonal IgE formation is typ-THE ROLE OF SUPERANTIGENS IN ALLERGIC RHINITIS, ASTHMA AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS 3 KEY MESSAGES ically found in the mucosal site, producing high concentrations of functional IgE antibodies. In sub- jects with allergic rhinitis (AR), with or without allergic asthma, a significant increase in the prev- alence and concentration of IgE antibodies to classical superanti- gens vs. controls was found, like- ly contributing to more severe symptoms.

Apart from AR and asthma, S. aureus and SE-IgE does also play a prominent role in chronic rhi- nosinusitis (CRS), especially in the nasal polyp (NP) phenotype.

CRS patients possessing this nonfunctioning polymorphism (TAS2R38) are more likely to have Pseudomonas sinus infection Staphylococcus aureus can contribute to CRS pathogenesis by several mechanisms: overt IL-13) IgE antibodies in maladaptive Th2 in CRSChronic polyposis (CRSsNP), interactions (HMI) are key to the pathogenesis of CRS manifesting as an unusual susceptibility to infection, biofilm formation, \"dysbiosis\" of the nasal/ sinus microbiome or \"maladaptive\" Th2-biased immune responses to microbial colonization. Defects in host innate immune responses po - tentiate these phenomena. Bacterial biofilm forms on sinus mucosa with an overall prevalence of 56.3% in surgical CRS series but less in CRSwNP. The pres - ence of polymicrobial biofilm or biofilm containing Staphylococcus aureus has been associated with more severe sinus disease preop - eratively and worse sinus symp - tom and nasal endoscopy scores postoperatively. An intraepithelial reservoir of Staphylococcus aureus (IESA) has been demonstrated in CRS patients, but its significance is unclear. The key features of \"dys - biosis\" of the sinus microbiome are summarized in Table 1. While the total bacterial burden in CRS tissue is similar to controls, there is an in - creased \"burden\" of Staphylococcus HOST-MICROBIAL INTERACTIONS IN CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS 4 KEY MESSAGES aureus . Certain bacterial taxa or species may be protective against CRS, whereas others may be uniquely harmful, although these observations derive from only one study. There is debate regarding the importance of colonizing fun - gi as drivers of maladaptive Th2 inflammation in CRS, stemming in part from difficulties in staining fungal hyphae or culturing viable fungi from sinus mucus samples Daniel L. Hamilos Massachusetts General Hospital Boston, USA293GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION G - Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) - mechanisms, epidemiology, risk factors and co-morbiditiesand in part from conflicting results regarding the immune stimulation afforded by colonizing fungi. Table 2 summarizes the key com - ponents involved in host-microbial interactions in the paranasal sinus - es. Tight junction proteins, adher - ens junction proteins and desmo - somal proteins maintain normal epithelial barrier function. No primary defects in these proteins have been described in CRS or NP, although decreased occludin and zonula occludens 1 and decreased E-cadherin were described in NP, likely secondary to allergic tissue inflammation. CRS is associated with a transient reduction in mu - cociliary clearance that normalizes following resolution of infection and restoration of sinus ostial pa - tency. There is no evidence for a primary defect in mucociliary clearance in CRS except in the rare patients with primary ciliary dyski - nesia (PCD) and cystic fibrosis (CF). level of the antimicro - bial protein lactoferrin has been found in CRS, whereas the level of other antimicrobial proteins has been found to be normal. Nitric ox - ide (NO) is constitutively produced at high levels in sinus epithelium by virtue of constitutive expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). The NO concentration in a healthy maxillary sinus (9.1 +/- 3.8 ppm) exceeds that necessary for antibacterial effects in vitro and is vastly higher than that produced in the nose or lungs (exhaled NO nor - mally < 50 ppb). Figure 2 summarizes current knowledge about microbial trig - gering of innate immune responses in CRS. Sino-nasal epithelial cells express Toll-like receptors (TRLs) that recognize pathogen-associ - ated molecular patterns (PAMPs) leading to production of antimi - crobial peptides and cytokines and chemokines that amplify innate and adaptive immune responses. No primary defects in sino-nasal TLRs have been described in CRS. Dectin and NOD-like receptors have not been studied in CRS. Bit - ter taste receptors, such as TAS2R, recognize besides bitter taste a quorum-sensing molecule from Pseudomonas aeruginosa resulting in production of antimicrobial NO and -defensin. A common pol - ymorphism (TAS2R38 variant) is associated with reduced signaling and an increased frequency of P aeruginosa infection in CRS pa - tients. There is evidence that links colo - nizing microorganisms to a mala - daptive Th2-biased \"local allergic\" response in NP. Certain fungi, such as Alternaria , induce production of IL-5 and IL-13, as well as IFN- in peripheral blood lymphocytes from CRS patients and elicit modest pro - duction of IL-5 and IL-13 from dis - persed NP T lymphocytes. Mucosal colonization with Staphylococcus aureus occurs in 64% of patients with CRSwNP, compared with 30% in healthy individuals or patients with CRSsNP, and staphylococcal superantigens (such as SEB) cause local proliferation of T lympho - cytes, local anti-SEB IgE antibody production and robust production of IL-5 and IL-13 in dispersed NP T lymphocytes. These studies sug - gest that colonizing Staphylococcus aureus is a major driver of the local maladaptive Th2-biased inflamma - tory response in CRSwNP. There is also evidence that links allergic in - flammation with down-regulation of TLR-9 expression which may account for some of the increased susceptibility of NP toward bacteri - al colonization.

Patients with antibody deficiencies are susceptible to bacterial pathogens and can develop recurrent or chronic upper and lower respiratory tract infections. It is important to recognize antibody deficiencies in patients with refractory rhinosinusitis Common variable immunodeficiency, selective IgA deficiency, and specific antibody deficiency account for the majority of antib ody deficiencies observed in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) Antibody deficiencies range in severity from mild to severe depending on the underlying pathology and levels of antibody production and function Treatment options of antibody deficiencies in patients with refractory CRS should be individualized and may include prophylactic antibiotics and immunoglobulin replacementChronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is as- sociated with significant morbid- ity and a high healthcare burden. Risk factors associated with CRS include atopy, structural abnor- malities and immune dysfunction. Thus, patients with CRS who are refractory to medical therapy, or those who present with recurrent sinus infections, are evaluated for immunodeficiency. Antibody deficiencies, such as specific antibody deficiency (SAD), common variable immunodefi- ciency (CVID), and selective IgA deficiency are among the primary immunodeficiencies (PID) that are associated with CRS (Tables 1,2). Antibody deficiencies should be considered in patients with CRS refractory to standard medical and surgical management. COMMON VARIABLE IMMUNODEFICIENCY Common variable Immunodefi - ciency (CVID) is the most common symptomatic antibody deficiency. Typically there is a reduction in at least two of the three major immu - noglobulin types: levels of IgG as well as IgA and/or IgM are reduced more than two standard deviations below the mean adjusted for age. In addition, there is an impaired an - tibody response to immunization IMMUNODEFICIENCY AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS 5 KEY MESSAGES with polysaccharide antigens and often to protein antigens. Quite often CVID is diagnosed in the second and third decade of life al - though symptoms may precede the diagnosis by many years. Recurrent infections involving the upper and lower respiratory tracts are often observed in CVID. The prevalence of CVID in patients with CRS at academic institutions ranges from 6-10%. In a European cohort study, CRS was present in 37% of CVID patients at diagnosis and increased to 54% after 11 years of follow up. CVID is a heterogeneous disorder with both infectious and noninfec -Anju T.

Many patients with CVID have noninfectious complications including chronic lung disease, autoimmunity, lym - phoma, granulomatous disease or inflammatory gastrointestinal disease. In addition, patients with CVID have a reduced lifespan when compared to the general population. These findings high - light the importance of diagnosing CVID in at-risk patients, including those with recurrent sinus infec - tions or refractory CRS. SELECTIVE IgA DEFICIENCY Prevalence of selective IgA defi - ciency ranges from 1 in 173 to 1 in 3024 persons. The prevalence may be increased in CRS and was reported in 3-6% of patients with CRS, who were evaluated for im - munodeficiency. The majority of patients with IgA deficiency are asymptomatic, however a small subset develops recurrent sinus in - fections or CRS. Atopy, asthma, and autoimmune diseases are also com - mon in patients with IgA deficiency. Patients with specific antibody de - ficiency (SAD) form normal quanti - ties of IgG antibodies, but the an - tibodies don't function well. SAD is diagnosed by demonstrating a poor response after a polysaccha - ride vaccine: typically 50-70% of pneumococcal serotypes should be at or above a protective level (>1.3 mcg/mL) after an unconju - gated pneumococcal polysaccha - ride vaccine. In an academic set - ting, up to 24% of patients with CRS, who were evaluated for im - mune problems had SAD. These patients received more antibiotic courses compared to patients with CRS who had an intact immune system, had an increased incidence of pneumonia, and 18% of the pa - tients with SAD were treated with immunoglobulins. IgG SUBCLASS DEFICIENCY IgG subclass deficiency is defined as one or more low IgG subclass- es with normal total IgG levels. The clinical significance of an iso- lated IgG subclass deficiency is controversial. Low levels of IgG subclasses have been reported in otherwise healthy individuals. It is believed that a lack of a functional response to a polysaccharide vac- cine is more important than defi- ciency in subclasses. For this reason, routine determination of IgG subclasses is not recommend- ed in the evaluation of immunode- ficiency in patients with CRS.TABLE 2 Phenotype and clinical features of common primary antibody deficiencies observed in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis Subtype Clinical Features Immunological Features Pan-hypogam- maglobulinemia (CVID)Upper and lower respiratory tracts bacterial infections, autoimmune diseases, in- creased risk of malignancy1.

The role of the specif- ic immune system is particularly interesting as the large surface in combination with the innate im- mune components and the mu- cosal surface represents a first contact point of immune system and inhaled environment includ- ing certain antigens. IMMUNE SYSTEM OF THE UPPER AIRWAYS A key hypothesis in T cell biology is that the antigen is taken up by dendritic cells and /or drained into the next lymph node, where anti - gens are presented in context with MHC class II to T cells and mobilize either de novo or memory respons - es along with help to differentiat - ing B cells. In contrast to the lower airways the existence of the nasal mucosa associated lymphoid tis - sue (MALT) is less clear and there - fore the turnover of lymphocytes is not fully known. However, it could be demonstrated that upon allergen-airway challenge T cells start to express enzymes encod - ed by the recombination-activat - ing genes. These enzymes are ex -T-CELL REGULATION IN CHRONIC PARANASAL SINUS DISEASE 6 KEY MESSAGES pressed to edit the germline genes of the B- and T cell receptors and also the switch of na\u00efve, IgM+ B cells to IgE. These studies demon - strate that lymphoid tissues are not essential for the maturation of the immune system and raise the question to which degree the tis - sue environment contribute to the maturation of the immune cells. T CELL SUBSETS While it is well established that T cells play a key role in the switch of uncommitted, IgM+ B cells into IgG+ or IgA+ or IgE+ memory phe- notypes, it became apparent that T cells do also play a key role in the instruction of tissue cells such as epithelial cells. In fact IL-17 and IL- 22 represent two T cell cytokines which act primarily or even exclu- sively on epithelial cells or kerat- inocytes. This finding raised the hope that paranasal sinus diseases could be treated with biologicals to block these cytokines. Howev- er, the analysis of T cells isolated Carsten B. Schmidt-Weber Technical University Munich and Helmholtz Center Munich, Germany299GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION G - Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) - mechanisms, epidemiology, risk factors and co-morbiditiesfrom local inflammation opposed to those that have been classical- ly isolated from peripheral blood displayed a phenotype that dif- fers from classical Th1, Th2, Th17 or Treg cells. While the classical T cell phenotypes express a narrow bandwidth of cytokines, the cells isolated from chronically affect- ed patients show a more diverse phenotype that is thought to or- igin from a \"plasticity\" of T cells. This plasticity has been report- ed for Th1 cells from peripheral blood that are able to express IL- 17 or IL-4 or Th2 cells expressing IFN-g, however expression can be reversible at least upon in vit - ro culture. Analysis of T cells from biopsies of patients suffering from chronic disease revealed that these T cells expressing multiple cytokines are not the exception, but rather a rule. In contrast to pe- ripheral blood cells, these clones are remarkably stable, These cells do not show a particular polariza- tion towards any of the effector phenotypes, but a depression of regulatory phenotypes. ORIGIN OF THE CYTOKINE ESCALATION A possible explanation for the or - igin of this cytokine escalation is the constant and repetitive expo - sure of upper airway cells to Staph -ylococcal aureus and its superanti - gens, which can activate the T cell receptor by cross-linking it with the MHC class II molecule, even in the absence of an antigen, which is normally located in the MHC- grove. This superantigen function may stepwise extend the T cell rep - ertoire to produce cytokines. REBOUND OF THE TISSUE The multitude of cytokines has functional consequences not only on other immune cells, but also on structural cells such as airway epithelial cells. At least from the pharmaceutical viewpoint most monovalent drugs targeting cy- tokines were unsuccessful, while biologicals with broader specific- ity that are hitting multiple tar- gets appear to be more effective. In fact, it appears that structural cells require the exposition to multiple cytokines before becom- ing themselves active in the ex- pression of defence mechanisms. Consequently, increased cytokine production by the T cells will also be followed by an extended medi- ator release of tissue cells. Taken together, it appears that future therapies may need to address im- mune cells and tissue cells at the same time to revert excessive im- mune activation and insufficient regulatory control.KEY REFERENCES Wu James LK, Vander Heid- en JA, Uduman M, Durham SR, Kleinstein SH, et al.

In addition chemokines that favor immune cell recruitment (CCL11, CCL18, CCL24, CCL26) and inflammatory cytokines and TNF are up-regulated in CRSwNP and enhance local in - flammation (Figure 1). The heterogeneity according to en - vironmental factors is underlined by data from nasal polyp tissue from a Chinese population. In this sub - group, inflammation is neutrophil dominated, non-eosinophilic (90%) and devoid of IL-5 protein and more aligned with a Th1/Th17-type re - sponse, with increased expression of IFN , IL-1\u00df, IL-6 and IL-17A. CRSsNP is of associated cytokines (IFN ), of TGF-\u00df1 TGF-\u00df2 receptors on effector cell populations and an up-regulation of the TGF-\u00df pathways, which is in accordance with typical fea- tures, such as fibrosis, basement membrane thickening, goblet cell sub-epithelial mono- nuclear inflammation and edema (Figure 2).

CRSwNP is dominated by a Th2-type inflammatory environment, which is insufficiently controlled by regulatory T-cells. The epithelium releases, either by secretion, or upon cell death and apoptosis, cytokines that activate innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) that produce large amounts of IL-5 and IL-13 in concert with Th2 cells. In addition, a number of chemokines are released that recruit Th2 cells. The Th2 cytokines recruit and activate eosinophils and mast cells, trigger their mediator release, promote local IgE production and activate alternatively-activated macrophages (AAM). Figure 2 The cytokine network in chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP). CRSsNP is characterized by an increased production of the T helper 1 (Th1) associated cytokines (IFN , TNF ) and an enhanced production of TGF- , accompanied by a higher expression of TGF 1 and TGF 2 receptors on effector cell populations. Moreover, the epithelium significantly contributes to inflammation by enhanced production of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF- . The frequency of neutrophils is higher in CRSsNP tissue as compared to controls. This leads to typical features like fibrosis, basement membrane thickening and goblet cell hyperplasia.

However, in most individuals, the airways remain free of patho- logical infection, largely due to multiple first-line innate immune mechanisms working in concert to defend the sinonasal epitheli- um. The primary physical defense is mucociliary transport (MCT), a specialized function of the airway epithelium, consisting of two com- ponents: mucus production and mucus transport. The airway sur- face liquid (ASL) lining the airways contains a top layer of mucus gel formed from mucin macromole- cules secreted by by \"sticky\" carbohydrates that trap inhaled pathogens and particulates. Below the mucus is a watery periciliary layer (PCL). The lower viscosity of the PCL allows motile cilia (Figure 1) to beat rap- idly in a spatially and temporally coordinated manner, transporting the debris- and pathogen-laden mucus toward the oropharynx (throat), where the mucus/path- ogen/debris mixture is cleared by swallowing or expectoration (Figure 2). MCT is complement-MUCOCILIARY TRANSPORT IN CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS 8 KEY MESSAGES ed by secretion of antimicrobial peptides (lysozyme, lactoferrin, nitrogen spe- cies (hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide) that directly kill pathogens. Epithelial cells can also secrete cy- tokines that recruit immune cells to sites of infection. The fundamental importance of MCT to airway health is high- lighted by two genetic diseases. In cystic fibrosis, a disease of al- tered ion transport, reduced PCL volume causes overly sticky mu- cus that severely impairs MCT and results in persistent upper airway infections and often fatal lung in- fections. Primary ciliary dyskine-sia, a genetic multi-organ disorder of cilia dysfunction, also caus- es severely impaired MCT and chronic airway infections. MCT can also be reduced by exposure to various environmental toxins or pathogens that produce ciliotoxic metabolites. While multiple causes contribute to the development of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), a common pathophysiologic sequela is the in- effective sinonasal MCT, resulting in stasis of sinonasal secretions and subsequent chronic infection and/or persistent inflammation. Studies have suggested that al- terations of mucus viscosity, ion transport, or ciliary beating may Robert J. Lee Noam A.

Inhaled pathogens are trapped by the sticky mucus layer overlaying the airway surface liquid (ASL). The mucus rides on top of the less viscous periciliary layer (PCL), propelled by the rapid (~8-15 Hz) beating of airway ciliated cells, which affect MCT by both regulating ciliary beat frequency, as well as transporting ions and fluid that affect the composition and viscosity of the PCL. Acquired or genetic defects in ciliary beating and/or ion transport can reduce MCT and lead to increased incidences of airway infections.Figure 1 Scanning electron micrograph (SEM) of rabbit maxillary sinus mucosa showing the \"carpet\" of airway cilia (~7 \u00b5m high) found on specialized epithelial cells that line both the upper and lower airway. Paranasal sinus mucosa is made up of predominately ciliated cells, giving the appearance of a shag carpet. Non-ciliated goblet cells are interspersed among the ciliated cells.

The presence of multiple pathophysio- logical mechanisms existing under the umbrella of CRS complicates treatment, but it is commonly be- lieved that increasing MCT in CRS patients is likely to be beneficial by promoting pathogen clearance, making the stimulation of sinon- asal ciliary function an attractive therapeutic target in CRS.

It has been noted to occur in the lower airways in asthma. The sinuses in chron- ic rhinosinusitis (CRS) have also been shown to exhibit features of remodeling (Table 1, Figure 1), de- scribed as resembling those of the asthmatic lower airways. The two major clinical CRS phenotypes (CRS without polyps - CRSsNP and with polyps - CRSwNP) exhib- it different remodeling patterns, as they exhibit different inflam- matory profiles. The clinical question that has re- cently been raised is whether recent basic science knowledge about remodeling could alter the management of CRS patients. Current treatment philosophies for CRS revolve around a concept of disease reversibility: steroids are given to reverse inflamma- tion; functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is performed to relieve ostial obstruction and re- store ventilation. Consequently, the occurrence of potentially-ir- reversible changes in the mucosa challenges this paradigm. One of the most important po- tentially-irreversible changes is AIRWAY REMODELING IN CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS 9 KEY MESSAGES collagen deposition by myofibro- blasts (activated fibroblasts), a process promoted mainly by the action of TGF-. Collagen dep- osition cannot be reversed by steroids (although some animal model studies, through measure-ment of subepithelial basement membrane thickness, suggested otherwise).

To our knowledge, early intervention with steroids has not been explic- itly investigated in CRS. As for the second means, there exists some low-level evidence (in the form of case series reports) for successful radical/extensive procedures to salvage \"dysfunctional sinuses\" (i.e. sinuses clinically perceived as irreversibly-diseased). The philos- ophy of these techniques is either a radical removal of dysfunctional mucosa (e.g. Caldwell-Luc or Den- ker's procedure) or clearance maximal os- tium-widening procedures (e.g. a maxillary sinus or a Draf-3 frontal drillout for a frontal sinus). But neither \"dysfunctional sinuses\" nor the benefit conferred by these tech- niques have been studied in re- lation to remodeling, which is a more recently described phenom- enon. In summary, the current level of evidence for a clinical value for remodeling in CRS is low (Level of Evidence: 5). Future studies need to ascertain whether remodeling actually plays a role in influencing the prognosis and/or treatment options. An initial good step is to investigate features of remodeling in a cohort of patients suffering from refractory CRS. KEY REFERENCES 1.

In addition, there is no distinct biological marker for CRS diagnosis and only a small propor - tion of patients undergo the objec - tive confirmatory diagnostic tests namely, of sinuses and nasal endoscopy. As a result, CRS epidemiological surveys rely on self-report of CRS symptoms (the presence of two or more symptoms for > 12 weeks: nasal congestion, nasal discharge, facial pressure/pain, loss of smell. One of the symptoms must be either congestion, or discharge) and have excluded individuals who report physician-diagnosis of AR. These surveys have detected a preva - lence of CRS of 5% to 13% in the United States (U.S.), Europe and China, which may be overestima - tions due to the absence of confir - mation by sinus CT or rhinoscopy. CRS is most prevalent in adults, because sinuses are not fully formed until adolescence. Medi- an age of diagnosis is 48.4 years EPIDEMIOLOGY OF CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS 10 KEY MESSAGES for CRS with nasal polyposis (CR- SwNP) and 40.3 years for CRS without nasal polyposis (CRSsNP). Prevalence rates peak between 35 and 64 years of age, and 20% of CRS patients have nasal polyps (NP). Males account for 54% of patients with CRSwNP and 42% of those with CRSsNP. The incidence rates of CRSwNP and CRSsNP in a primary care pop- ulation in the United States were 83 and 1,048 cases per 100,000 person-years, respectively. Pa- tients with CRSwNP were older and more likely males compared with CRSsNP. PRE-MORBID CONDITIONS The cause of CRS is unknown. Pre-morbid conditions (Table 1) present before the onset of CRS may reveal clues to the pathogene - sis of the disease in the future. Pri - or to diagnosis of CRSsNP, patients experienced increased prevalence of infections of the respiratory tract, skin/soft tissue, and urinary tract compared to the general pop - ulation. Before the initial CRS di - agnosis, patients also have greater number of visits to physicians and of antibiotic prescriptions. CO-MORBIDITIES Patients with CRS may suffer several co-morbidities (Table 2). Those with CRSwNP have a high- er prevalence of atopic conditions than those with CRSsNP. Subtypes of CRS include eosino - philic CRS, allergic fungal rhinosi -Pedro C.

AFRS can be present in 0-23% of all CRS patients with higher prev - alence in warm and humid geo - graphic regions, and also among the young, African Americans, and those of low socioeconomic status. AERD may also affect up to 23% of CRS patients, and is more common in women, and those with atopic diseases (asthma and AR). In tertiary medical care centers, antibody deficiencies have been identified in up to 22% of adult CRS patients and up to 50% of children with CRS, and more so in those with CRSwNP. These defi- ciencies are mainly functional an- tibody deficiencies, selective IgG deficiency and common variable immunodeficiency. Children with cystic fibrosis are also at risk of developing CRSwNP. Other co-morbidities include asthma, sinus mucosal bacterial biofilms, and aspirin sensitivity. Asthma is more prevalent in pa- tients with CRSwNP and women, a combination often associated with severe forms of asthma.HEALTH CARE COST AND UTILIZATION CRS is associated with a large health burden to the patient and society (Table 3). It costs several billion dollars annually in direct health care costs in the United States. Patients with CRS miss a number of workdays similar to those experiencing an acute asth- ma episode (5.79 days/year). Out of pocket expenses for patients with CRS are greater than that of patients with chronic bronchitis, asthma, or AR. About 50% of all sinus surgeries performed in CRS are nasal polypectomies. Up to 69% of polypectomies are repeat surgeries because NP often recur. REFERENCES Fokkens VJ, Mullol J, Bachert C, Alobid I, Baroody F, et al.

Differentiation of risk fac- tors from comorbidities remains difficult due to variable disease definitions, lack of longitudinal studies to establish temporal re- lationships between exposure and disease onset and difficulty in the evaluation of the dose-effect size on the disease severity. CILIARY IMPAIRMENT Patients syn- drome, primary ciliary dyskinesia, and cystic fibrosis have frequently a long history of CRS. ALLERGY Considering its frequent asso- ciation with CRS and its similar increasing prevalence, atopy has been suspected to predispose to CRS, because the swelling of the nasal mucosa in allergic rhinitis may compromise ventilation at the site of the sinus ostia and, ad- ditionally, the sinus inflammation could be induced through a local extension from the initial nasal in- flammation.RISK FACTORS FOR CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS 11 KEY MESSAGES ASTHMA In a recent study on over 52,000 adults, GA2LEN researchers con - cluded that there was a strong as - sociation of asthma with CRS. In another study, a highly significant and independent correlation was noted between the extent of dis - ease and the peripheral eosinophil count, presence of asthma and of atopy.

It is characterised by two or more symptoms, one of which should be either nasal blockage/ obstruction/congestion or nasal discharge (anterior/posterior na- sal drip), \u00b1 facial pain/pressure, \u00b1 reduction or loss of smell. In a spe- cialist/ENT setting, CRS diagnosis is supported by endoscopic signs of nasal polyps, and/or mucop- urulent discharge primarily from middle meatus, and/or oedema/ mucosal obstruction primarily in middle meatus and by computer tomographic (CT) findings such mucosal changes within the osti- omeatal complex and/or sinuses. In children CSR is defined as for adults except that cough replaces reduced or loss of sense of smell. Both adults and children CRS may be classified based on the visual analogue scale (VAS) score (0 - 10cm) as mild (VAS 0-3), moder- ate (VAS between 3-7) or severe (VAS >7) (Figure 1).

Inflammation of mucosal surfaces that produces pain also produces significant other sino-nasal symptoms Infective exacerbations of CRS usually last at least 1-2 we eks. Flare-ups that last only several days are likely to be rhini tis and not rhinosinusitis Cough and other regional symptoms such as dysphonia are more likely to represent broader airway involvement in a chronic inflammatory process than direct effects of sinus diseaseThe presenting symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) are broad. However, four cardinal features are often present: nasal congestion, nasal discharge, facial pressure and loss/distortion of smell. These are the 'local' symp- toms of chronic sino-nasal disease (Figure 1). Regional symptoms include Eustachian tube dysfunc- tion, cough, post-nasal drip and dysphonia. Although, these symp- toms can be a result of direct ir- ritation from secretions, they are more likely to represent broader involvement of the airway in the associated disease process. When it comes to chronic disease, com- partmentalization of airway symp- toms (upper, lower, middle) is the exception rather than the rule. Systemic features include malaise and minor depression. The local features are important and current diagnostic criteria need to include the presence of nasal congestion or discharge with either pressure or smell loss in the setting of endoscopic or radiological evidence of mucosal inflammation (Figure 2). Nasal congestion is very ambig - uous and the term nasal obstruc - tion is often avoided as the ques - tion is raised as to why is the nose CLINICAL FEATURES OF CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS 13 KEY MESSAGES blocked, if the inflammatory con - dition is primarily in the sinuses? Although concomitant rhinitis can exist, this nasal congestion is seen even in simple localised forms of CRS (infected fungal ball, odonto - genic CRS). Along with the vasodi - lation that can occur from nearby inflammation, there is an ipsilateral nasal reflex with induced vascular dilation in response to sinus stimu - lus. Thus, congestion is often used to describe this symptom in CRS, outside the direct involvement of the nasal cavity with nasal polyps. Nasal discharge is a common fea- ture in the setting of CRS. Ante- rior mucoid discharge is common in inflammatory disease and is often green in appearance. The green pigment of mucus comes from the iron containing heme groups of myeloperoxidase. Mye- loperoxidase comprises 5% of the dry weight of polymorphonuclear cells and it accumulates in ab- sence of bacteria, rarely implying infection. Cachosmia associated with discharge is common feature of CRS of odontogenic origins and signals true bacteria contribution.

CRS is inherently a mucosal inflammatory condition and the presence of facial pressure (pain) needs to be proportionate to oth- er symptoms that should exist if significant mucosa-based inflam- mation were present. This is the basis for facial pain not being a primary presentation of CRS. If mucosal inflammation was caus- ing significant pain, then it is axi- omatic that other non-pain based symptoms would be present (con- gestion, discharge). Patients with facial pain as major presenting complaint rarely have CRS as the Clinical features of chronic rhinosinusitis Figure 1 The constellation of presenting symptoms between rhinitis and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) can at first appear very similar. However, the nasal obstruction (congestion) and rhinorrhoea (mucoid discharge) of rhinitis differ to CRS due to the underlying pathophysiological process in the sino-nasal cavity.

The use of symptoms alone has a poor specificity even with specialist assessment.cause. Loss or distortion of smell is a common finding in CRS, but not in rhinitis. Olfaction is sensitive to mucosal oedema (due to vascular congestion) and is a strong predic- tive factor for CRS. Finally, for CRS patients, the dis- ease burden and impact on qual- ity of life is high. Although not life-threatening, it causes loss of productivity, accounts for a signif- icant proportion of presentations to primary care physicians and re- sults in a large health expenditure cost.

Unfortunately, these requirements generally are not clearly fulfilled for CRS. CRS is defined as 12 weeks of documented disease. However, the duration is difficult to verify as the onset of disease may not be recognized. The clinical criteria for CRS overlap with the more com- mon forms of rhinitis and among the subtypes of CRS (Table 1). Most forms of chronic rhinitis in- crease the likelihood of CRS since the sinus mucosa is contiguous with the nasal mucosa; therefore, there is overlap among the dis- ease mechanisms for rhinitis and CRS. The typical symptoms of rhi- nosinusitis, which help define the phenotype, are nonspecific and overlap with rhinitis. Recurrent acute rhinosinusitis (3 or more ep- isodes per year) may be confused with CRS. Finally, sinusitis is often diagnosed clinically, which may result in over- or under-diagnosis. Ideally endoscopy or paranasal CT ENDOTYPES AND PHENOTYPES OF CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS 14 KEY MESSAGES imaging should confirm the diag- nosis, if CRS is suspected. Thus, the clinical features of CRS limit the ability to accurately pheno- type and endotype the disease. CRS has multiple causes (Figure 1) and the partial ability to precise- ly identify causal mechanisms re- duces the likelihood to define the endotype (underlying pathobio- logic mechanism), and to recog- nize the unique phenotypic char- acteristics. The CRS phenotypes generally accepted are presented in Table 2. These categories are not mutually exclusive.

Furthermore, the apparent endo- type of mucosal inflammation, as recognized by selective cell ac- tivation and/or cytokine profile, may vary with different mucosal samples from the same individual. Thus, the inflammatory response, which reflects the genetic and environmental interaction, may not be clearly distinguishable. The characteristics of mucosal inflam- mation often may not be recog- nized until surgical specimens are histologically and biochemically studied. CRS is often treated by surgery, particularly for asymmetric dis- ease or obstructive NP. However, CRS is usually a medical condition and successful outcomes invar- iably require adequate medical evaluation and pre- and post-op- erative therapy. Clinically useful sampling methods, other than surgery, are needed to better fa- cilitate endotypic characteriza- tion. Bacterial infection, other than staphylococcal colonization with endotoxin and protein A pro- duction is not generally important to the pathogenesis of CRS, but could exacerbate CRS. Finally, multiple systemic diseases may have CRS as a component of the condition, and the endotypes of these forms of CRS are different, even though the phenotypic pres- entation may be similar (Table 2). Pathogenic mechanisms associ- ated with each of the CRS phe- notypes are not universally ac-TABLE 2 rhinosinusitis Limited, negative or conflicting data; SA/SE/SPA: Staphylococcal aureus colonization or infection and Antinuclear chronic rhinosinusitis319GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION G - Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) - mechanisms, epidemiology, risk factors and co-morbiditiescepted, although a significant body of research suggests disease mechanisms or potential pathoge- netic associations (Table 2). The mechanisms include epithelial barrier abnormalities, selective T cell subpopulation stimulation, local specific-IgE production, se- lective growth of microorgan- isms, enhanced leukotrienes and/ or prostaglandin concentrations, specific cytokine profiles, and pro- duction of factors that regulate fibrosis or cell recruitment such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF-). Identification of some of these mechanisms has resulted in improved therapeutic approaches or suggestions for more effective therapies (Table 2). The role of in- fectious agents, very important in acute sinusitis or acute exacerba- tions of chronic disease, is unclear with difficulties in interpreting culture or genetic identification of infectious organisms due to the possibility of nonspecific or secondary colonization. There is a sizeable literature on the role of Staphylococcus aureus in CRSwNP and possibly in CRS without NP (CRSsNP) and fungal organisms in AFRS. Thus, infectious agents are likely important in selecting the endotypes of CRS and definitely for exacerbations of CRS. Tools generally available to the clinician to phenotype/endotype CRS are listed in Table 3. Research or surgical approaches for CRS characterization or measures of systemic diseases are listed in Table 4. The major limitation in utilizing endotypic assessment of CRS and therapies targeted to dis- ease endotype (Table 2) is the lim- ited availability of cost effective strategies to clinically characterize CRS and the lack of clinical trials of endotypically characterized CRS. The treatment of CRS will likely improve if these barriers to CRS endotyping are overcome. KEY REFERENCES 1. Fokkens WJ, Lund VJ, Mullol J, Bachert C, Alobid I, Baroody F, et al.

However, more than half of CR- SwNP patients in Japan and East Asia have non-eosinophilic CR- SwNP. Until 30 years ago, most in- dividuals with CRS in Japan were shown to exhibit purulent rhinor- rhea (including abundant neutro- phils). This Japanese conventional CRS was well controlled by the combination of macrolide therapy (long-term, low-dose) and endo- scopic sinus surgery (ESS). How- ever, since the 1990s, the number of CRSwNP patients shown to be refractory to the combined ther- apy has increased gradually. One of the histologic characteristics of the disease is massive infiltration by eosinophils of the nasal polyps (NP). Hence, \"eosinophilic chron- ic rhinosinusitis\" (ECRS) has been used to classify this refractory subtype in Japan since 2001. The most prevalent characteris- tic clinical features of ECRS are a strong tendency for recurrence after ESS and the effectiveness of oral (systemic) corticosteroids for the treatment of recurrent EOSINOPHILIC CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS 15 KEY MESSAGES NP. Clinical features of ECRS in comparison with Japanese con- ventional CRS are listed in Table 1. Anosmia appears early in the illness and is characteristic for ECRS. While NP are raised from the middle meatus in most non- ECRS patients, ECRS patients can exhibit bilateral NP that are often found in both side of the middle turbinate. Two-thirds of ECRS pa- tients have asthma, and most are non-atopic with adult onset. CT findings are useful to distin- guish ECRS from non-ECRS involvement of sinus and olfactory cleft characteristic for ECRS. Massive infiltration of eosinophils of NP and eosinophilia in peripheral blood are also characteristics of ECRS. Eosinophilia in tissue and periph- eral blood are closely correlated in most patients. Gene-expression studies have revealed the unique pathophysiologic features of ECRS compared with non-ECRS. From these characteristic features we proposed a diagnostic proce- dure for ECRS (Table 2).

Fungi are ubiquitous in the environment and accordingly, they are very frequently detected on the nasal mucosa of healthy individuals and their presence only rarely causes disease. The interaction between fungi and nasal mucosa is deter- mined largely by the host immune state. Fungal sinus disease can be divided into non-invasive forms, which are usually seen in immuno- competent patients, and invasive forms usually seen in immuno- compromised patients. BIOLOGY OF FUNGI The kingdom of fungi encompass- es an enormous diversity of or- ganisms from single-celled yeasts to large mushrooms. Moulds are mainly responsible for causing dis- ease in the sinonasal tract and are fungi that grow in the form of mul- ticellular filaments called hyphae. Moulds and their airborne sexual spores or asexual conidia are pres- ent in all habitable environments and so human beings inhale them constantly.FUNGAL SINUS DISEASE 16 KEY MESSAGES NON-INVASIVE DISEASE Fungal ball are dense accumula - tions of fungal hyphae within the mucosal confines of a paranasal sinus or sinuses, without tissue invasion (Figure 1). As sinonasal symptoms and clinical signs are either absent or non-specific, the diagnosis is usually made radiolog - ically, and often incidentally, when patients are scanned for non-rhi - nologic indications. Treatment consists of endoscopic removal of all the fungal content within the in - volved sinus and the maximal wid - ening of its ostium. There is usual - ly no need for topical or systemic antifungal therapy postoperatively. Allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS) is a nosinusitis by a hy- reaction to fungi col- onizing the is characterized by intense ophilic mucosal inflammation. It is unlikely that IgE-mediated hyper- sensitivity is the major pathogenic factor of this condition and almost certainly other mechanisms of hy- persensitivity are involved. AFRS typically affects young, atopic patients. The resultant CRS with nasal poly- posis (NP) is often recalcitrant to conventional treatment. Nasal mucus is characteristically thick, tenacious and coloured from tan to brown or black and is rich in eosinophils or eosinophil degrad- ed products (Figure 2). Severe or neglected cases may present with facial deformity, hypertelorism and proptosis. AFRS has some dis- tinctive radiological appearanc- es both on CT and MRI scanning (Figure 3).

Howev- er, identical clinical forms of CRS, but without type I hypersensitiv- ity to fungi (eosinophilic fungal rhinosinusitis) or without proven presence of fungi (eosinophilic mucin rhinosinusitis) have been described, raising the question whether AFRS as defined by the Bent and Kuhn criteria represents just a subset of this condition. The treatment of AFRS is pre- dominantly surgical and involves the removal of all fungal debris and associated NP. Postoperative topical medical therapy with sa- line lavage and intranasal corti- costeroids probably increases the chance of achieving a good long- term outcome. In spite of these measures, some patients will need multiple surgeries to achieve con- trol of their disease. Antifungal drugs and immunotherapy may have a role as adjuvant therapy, but no clinical trial has demon- strated convincing efficacy.Figure 4 Left orbital exenteration in a patient with acute invasive fungal rhinosinusitis. Fungal sinus disease INVASIVE DISEASE Acute invasive fungal rhinosinus- itis (AIFRS) is an acute life-threat- ening condition, in which the fungal infection invades underly- ing mucosal tissue, as a result of an impaired immune response. It tends to spread aggressively, and often has a fulminant course, pro- gressing over hours. Eye, brain, palate and skin involvement can occur (Figure 4). The symptoms are often non-specific and a high index of suspicion in an immuno- compromised patient with sinon- asal symptoms and/or fever is mandatory to facilitate early diag- nosis. Treatment of AIFS has three pillars: (1) urgent surgical debride- ment of all the necrotic tissue, (2) immediate initiation of systemic antifungal therapy and (3) immune reconstitution (if possible). AIFS is still associated with high mortali- ty rates (10% to 50%) determined mainly by the potential for host immune reconstitution and the extent of involvement at the time of recognition of the disease.

Co-existence of CRS with NP and asthma and rather similar charac- teristics of inflammation support assumption that all are, at least in part, the same disease pro- cess. Nasal allergy is also related to inflammatory chronic sinusitis as a risk factor. There are a lot of co-morbidities which often occur with CRS (Table 1). CRS AND ASTHMA: CRS with/ without NP and asthma are dis- eases that often occur together. A recent large-scale European CO-MORBIDITIES OF CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS 17 KEY MESSAGES survey confirmed the strong asso- ciation between CRS and asthma. CRS in the absence of nasal aller- gies was associated with late-on- set asthma. CRS AND ALLERGIC RHINITIS : Allergic rhinitis is a common co- existing disease in patients with CRS. The data about the associ- ation between the 2 diseases in children is variable.

Sinonasal inflammation is found in most CF patients, with NP being present in 1/3 of CF pa- tients. CRS AND CHRONIC OBSTRUC- TIVE PULMONARY DISEASE : A majority of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) pa- tients presenting at an academic unit of respiratory disease re- port sinonasal symptoms. Sev- eral pro-inflammatory mediators have been found increased in the nasal lavages of COPD patients. The presence of nasal symptoms is associated with the overall im- pairment of the quality of life in COPD. CRS AND ASPIRIN EXACERBAT- ED RESPIRATORY DISEASE : The presence of hypersensitivity to as- pirin or other NSAIDs in a patient with rhinosinusitis and NP is asso- ciated with a particularly persis- tent and treatment-resistant form of the disease, coexisting usually with severe asthma and referred to as the \"aspirin triad\". CRS AND IMMUNODEFICIEN- CIES : There was an association between rhinosinusitis and pri- mary immunodeficiencies. Among CRS patients, who are referred for immune evaluation, up to half may have T lymphocyte dysfunction, while roughly 20% have decreased IgG, IgA or IgM. In addition, nearly 10% have common variable im- mune deficiency (CVID). ADE- NOIDS IN : Nasal dis- charge could be due to adenoiditis alone and that the bacterial reser- voir of the adenoids more than their size was important in the relationship between CRS and the hypertrophied adenoids (Figure 2). GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE : The number of cases with a concomitant diagnosis of sinusitis was significantly higher in the children with gastro-esopha- geal reflux disease (GERD) (4.19%) compared to the control group (1.35%) (Figure 3). PRIMARY CILIARY DYSKINESIA : Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is the most cause of ciliary dysfunction. PCD is an autosomal recessive disorder present in 1 of 15,000 of the population. Half the children with PCD also have situs inversus, bronchiectasis, and CRS and are known as Kartagener's syndrome. The diagnosis should be suspected in a child with atypi- cal asthma, bronchiectasis, chron- ic wet cough and mucus produc- tion, rhinosinusitis, chronic and severe otitis media (especially with chronic drainage in children with ear tubes).

In contrast to asthma, the concept of control of disease has only recently been introduced in the field of al - lergic rhinitis (AR) and chronic rhi - nosinusitis (CRS). In asthma treat - ment guidelines are based on the assessment of control. A number of terms have been used in the past to describe un- controlled disease. Bousquet et al. suggested the term SCUAD (severe chronic upper airway dis- ease) to define those patients whose symptoms are inadequate- ly controlled despite adequate (ie, effective, safe, and acceptable) treatment based on guidelines. The patients have impaired qual- ity of life, social functioning, sleep, and school/work performance. SCUAD patients can have sever- al phenotypes like severe uncon- trolled AR, non-allergic rhinitis, or CRS with or without nasal polyps (NP). Other terms that can be found in the literature are recalci- trant rhinosinusitis, The European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps UNCONTROLLED RHINOSINUSITIS 18 KEY MESSAGES (EPOS) defined in 2012 EPOS cri - teria for difficult to treat and dis - ease control in CRS. Disease con - trol in CRS was defined a disease state in which the patients do not have symptoms or the symptoms are not bothersome, if possible combined with a healthy or almost healthy mucosa and only the need for local medication. Patients who do not reach an acceptable level of control, despite adequate surgery, intranasal corticosteroid treatment and up to 2 short courses of anti - biotics or systemic corticosteroids in the last year can be considered to have difficult-to-treat rhinosi - nusitis. In EPOS 2012 a method of evaluating control was proposed (Table 1). Recently a modification of the EPOS 2012 control method was proposed: the ''NOSE'' stag - ing system measuring only nasal obstruction, systemic medication use, and endoscopic signs of in - flammation.It has been estimated that up to 20% of CRS patients are not well controlled despite receiving com- bination maximal medical therapy and endoscopic sinus surgery. A wide variety of factors can con- tribute to poor disease control, including patient-related factors such as eosinophilic CRS, osteitis, biofilms, other es like cystic fibrosis and vasculitis and physician-related factors such as inappropriate sinus surgery or inaccessible topical therapy. Pe- riodical assessment of disease control should guide alterations in therapy according to a stepwise approach and optimize CRS man- agement. A stepwise approach based on the EPOS2012 guide- lines is suggested in Figure 1. KEY REFERENCES 1. Bousquet J, Bachert et al. Unmet needs in se- vere chronic upper airway disease Wytske J.

It is diagnosed by a combination of symptoms and further confirma- tory tests using either endosco- py or computed tomography. In epidemiological surveys reliance is generally placed on symptom questionnaires and occasionally on reported diagnoses; confirma- tory tests are generally not feasi- ble. Questionnaires based on in - ternational diagnostic guidelines are not adequate to make a clin- ical diagnosis but have had some validation as indicators of disease. Studies of CRS in adults have given estimates of prevalence of around 8-10% but there is some variation, some of which is relat- ed to differences in the way the condition is assessed. A multi-site survey in Europe (Figure 1) based on symptom questionnaires gave estimates between 6.9 and 21.7% and a similar multisite study in Chi- na gave prevalences between 4.8 and 9.7%. In general, prevalences based on self-reported diagnoses give figures about a half of these figures, but studies in north Amer- ica have given estimates of 11% for sinusitis in the USA and 6.7% THE GLOBAL BURDEN OF CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS 19 KEY MESSAGES for rhinosinusitis in Canada based on self-reported diagnoses. The European studies suggest that CRS is more common in old- er age groups, though elsewhere the peak prevalence in is early adulthood. This difference may represent differences in disease between birth cohorts as well as differences in susceptibility as people age. Most studies agree that smoking is strongly associat- ed with disease (Figure 2). CRS is, in turn, a risk factor for late onset asthma, though it is not associat- ed with early onset asthma. In this respect, it is different from allergic rhinitis (Figure 3). Studies using generic measures of quality of life suggest that the im- pairment of QOL is similar in mag- nitude for patients with asthma and patients with CRS (Figure 4). Those who have both conditions have a worse quality of life than those who just have one condi- tion. KEY REFERENCES 1. Tomassen P, Lotvall J, Gun- nbjornsdottir M, al.

It has been well documented that symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) do not correlate well with CT findings, and that the sensation of nasal obstruction does not corre - late well with nasal airflow alone. Performed under topical anesthe - sia and typically following decon - gestion, it provides for a detailed examination of the nose, naso - pharynx, middle meatus and sphe - no-ethmoidal recess. A 2.7mm or 4mm 30 0 or 45 0 endoscope is uti - lized most commonly, although a 700 endoscope may be required in some situations. As an alternative, flexible fiberoptic endoscopy can provide good visualization, but does not facilitate endoscopically directed culture or biopsy. Following the application of a top - ical xylocaine or tetracaine spray, usually combined with a topical decongestant (oxymetazaline), na - sal endoscopy is best performed in a systematic fashion with three passes (below the inferior turbi - nate, between the inferior and middle turbinate and, when possi - ble, with direct examination of the middle meatus. For the latter, ad - ditional anesthesia (such as with NASAL ENDOSCOPY 1 KEY MESSAGES 4% cocaine on nasal applicators) may be required. The first pass of the endoscope provides an overview of the nasal anatomy, of the Hausner's valve, the evaluation of the status of the inferior turbinate and the naso - pharyngeal anatomy. Passing the endoscope between the inferior and middle turbinate allows visu - alization of the uncinate process and anterior middle meatus, sphe - noethmoidal recess and some vis - ualization of the olfactory cleft (Figure 1). The middle meatus is often best entered inferiorly, there - by permitting visualization of the ethmoidal bulla, and hiatus semi - lunaris. Gentle pressure on the un - cinate process may reveal edema within the ethmoidal infundibulum, frequently the initial area involved in inflammatory disease (Table 1).Careful evaluation should be per - formed for the presence of pol - yps, edema, drainage throughout the examination (Figure 2). Endo - scopically directed culture is per - formed when indicated, and bi - opsy of suspicious lesions can be performed under local anesthesia when indicated. For endoscopic biopsy, a 5cm 27G needle may be bent appropriately, and when attached to a 1cc syringe usually allows direct injection of the ma - jority lesions within the nose. Bi - opsy of possible juvenile angiofi - broma lesions should be avoided, and careful consideration should be given prior to office biopsy of other vascular lesions. Postoperatively, nasal endoscopy directs the duration and types of medical therapy, as well as the ne - cessity for debridement. Following Nasal endoscopyDavid W.

In patients with persistent or recur - rent disease, particular attention should be directed to the frontal recess and to the natural ostium of the maxillary sinus. Ensuring the natural ostium of maxillary si - nus is truly open and not scarred anteriorly frequently requires uti - lization of a 450 or 70 0 endoscope. Thus nasal endoscopy comple - ments the careful patient history in the diagnosis of CRS, augments the information which can be ob - tained by imaging and provides objective evidence of the thera - peutic response over time, espe - cially in postoperative patients who are frequently essentially asymptomatic despite persistent inflammatory disease.

Volumetric scanning with a multi-detector CT scan, use of 0.5 mm or 0.6 mm axial acquired CT images, and reformatted images in the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes afford an excellent display of the regional soft tissue and bone detail. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a clinical diagnosis made in the set - ting of persistent sinus symptoms for greater than 12 consecutive weeks, and is the most common indication for sinus imaging.

The secretions opacifying the si - nus lumen have a variable appear - ance. In the acute phase, the low viscosity secretions are of inter - mediate to low attenuation on CT (10-25 Hounsfield units). There is a uniform mucosal thickening along the sinus walls accompanied by a fluid exudate that may result in an air-fluid level within the si - nus. If the obstruction continues, the mucosal thickening will in - crease and may proceed to totally occupy the obstructed sinus. With chronicity, the secretions become more viscous with increased CT densities (30-60 HU), resulting from the relative increase in the protein concentration as the wa - ter component decreases. These changes are not always visually apparent, and therefore a distinc - tion between acute,subacute and chronic inflammation inflamma - tion cannot always be made on CT scans. With time, however, the inflammation may extend into the bony perimeter of the sinus, with sclerosis and thickening of the sinus walls representing osteitis, and a sign of chronicity (Figure 2). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides better soft tissue resolution and is useful in cer - tain instances including compli - cations of sinusitis and in differ - entiating inflammatory mucosal disease from neoplasia. On MRI, the chronic proteinaceous or in - spissated secretions appear hy - perintense on the T1-weighted images hypointense on the T2-weighted images with periph - eral rim of mucosal enhancement on the post contrast images. It is also useful to remember that the viscous secretions may restrict diffusion in the absence of frank purulent change. In general, CRS is not associated with bone erosion. Should bone erosion be present, one needs to consider the presence of other pathologies such as a mucocele, invasive fungal with polyangiitis, or a superimposing neoplasm. Should the bone erosion affect the skull base the possibility of a mucocele, meningocele, meningoencepha - locele, or septal destruc - tion can also occur with rhinosinus - itis due to cocaine use, lymphoma, and post unsuccessful septoplasty. To reach a more focused diagnosis, MRI with and without intravenous gadolinium based contrast admin - istration will be very helpful.

Even if olfacto - ry impairment is a common symp - tom affecting 61-83% of patients with CRS, up to one quarter of the patients with CRS are unaware of their olfactory dysfunction. Psychophysical tests results show that patients with CRSsNP or CR - SwNP have quantitative disor - ders (hyposmia more frequently then anosmia), report fluctuating symptoms and have fewer quali - tative disorders such as parosmia (28%) without sino-nasal aeti - ology of smell pertubation. Also, it is widely accepted that patients with CRSwNP have lower olfac - tory function than patients with CRSsNP (Figure 1). Psychophysical testing is important when medical and/or surgical treatments are not effective or when the dysfunction of the chemosensory perception is important for the patient (Fig - ure 2).

However there is only little correlation between nasal resist - ance and the degree of olfactory dysfunction. In addition, surgical therapy, although improving the nasal patency, has sometimes un - certain results when considering the olfactory recovery. Biopsies of the olfactory nasal neuroep - ithelium in patients suffering from CRS revealed inflammatory changes in the nasal mucosa and apoptotic pathological changes, including the olfactory receptor neurons and olfactory support - ing cells. Infiltrating inflammatory cells release inflammatory media -tors, which are known to trigger hypersecretion in respiratory and Bowman's glands altering the ion concentrations of olfactory mucus and affecting the olfactory trans - duction process. In addition, cy - tokines and mediators, particular - ly those released by eosinophils, may be toxic to olfactory receptor neurons and the degree of in - flammation changes in the neuro - pithelium is related to the severity of olfactory dysfunction. Evaluation of the orthonasal func - tion can be performed through many standardized tests. The Snif - fin' Sticks test and the University of Pennsylvania smell identifica - tion test (UPSIT ) are the most frequently used (Figure 3). These 341GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION H - Chronic rhinosinusitis - diagnosis and management semi-objective tests require the collaboration of the patients and need to be age and sex-related to allow distinction between nor - mosmia, hyposmia and anosmia. Retronasal olfactory performanc - es can also be evaluated following a standardized method using pow - der substances delivered inside the oral cavity using an identifica - tion task. A more objective way to determine the olfactory function facilitated by electrophysiological techniques and by chemosensory evoked potentials recording. This technique is based on the fact that a brief olfactory stimulus elic - it transient changes in the ongoing electrographic activity. To evalu - ate the olfactory function a pure odorant substance (i.e. 2-pheny - lethanol ) is delivered in the nose of the patients. Brain responses are then recorded and averaged and responses are transformed into a single waveform called the olfactory event-related potentials. In CRS, both orthonasal and ret -ronasal scores can be decreased and chemosensory even related potentials may demonstrate sub - tle changes in the amplitude and/ or latency in moderate cases and may be absent in severe cases. Because it is impossible to record olfactory event related potentials in up to one third of the normal subjects, electrophysiological studies need to be interpreted with caution. Beside CT scanning of the nose and of the paranasal sinuses, the magnetic resonance (MRI) is the imaging modality of choice for the evaluation of the olfactory appa - ratus since it allows examining the olfactory bulb, olfactory tract and central olfactory projection areas (Figure 4). The assessment of ol - factory bulb volume is particularly useful in the evaluation of olfacto - ry disorder with a non sino-nasal origin. For the sino-nasal related olfactory dysfunction MRI may demonstrate changes in the olfac - tory bulb volume related to the re - sidual olfactory function and more importantly some plasticity when the olfactory bulb volume is in - creased after a surgical procedure.

Based on clinical experience, systemic corticoids remain important for the treat - ment of CRSwNP, as they provide short-term symptom relief. Short term courses of oral corticoster - oids are usually given two to three times yearly. Oral antibiotics together with topical corticosteroids have been proven to act synergistically, though antibiotics are reserved for the acute exacerbations of CRS. Low-dose macrolides have been used as a long-term antibiot -ic treatment in CRS, while topical antibiotics remain an option for refractory cases where traditional topical steroids and oral antibiot - ics are ineffective.

According to the GAL2EN study, approximately, 57% of patients with CRS report symptoms of allergic rhinitis (AR) as well. The correlation with asth - ma is stronger in those patients with both CRS and AR symptoms. In the absence of AR, CRS has a positive correlation with a late onset asthma. To sum up, check - ing for allergy is advocated in CRS patients. Antileukotrienes (mon - telukast) might have a beneficial effect in patients with NP. Following the current evolution in phenotyping, more personal -ized treatments based on the un - derlying inflammation will most likely be considered in the future. Recent insight into B cell differen - tiation into IgE-secreting plasma cells in CRSwNP help to under - stand the phenomenon of local - ized IgE production in NP without correlation to systemic IgE levels or to SPT results. The results of clinical trials sug - gest that anti-IL-5 antibodies like reslizumab could play a role in the treatment of selected CRS pa - tients with NP. Given the cost of targeted treatments with mono - clonal antobodies, they will prob - ably be used for severe recurrent NP associated with difficult to control asthma. Considering local production of IgE antibodies in NP, it appears that local IgE is func - tional in the regulation of chron - ic inflammation. So, methods to antagonize IgE antibodies could be of relevance. Omalizumab, a recombinant DNA-derived hu - manized IgG monoclonal antibody has been studied and approved for asthmatic patients. Up to date omalizumab is not recommended for patients with NP. Future rand - omized controlled trials for further evaluation of benefit of therapies with anti-IL-5 and anti-IgE are re - quired.

There is good evidence that INS are a beneficial treatment also for CRSwNP. They improve nasal symptoms, reduce polyp size and prevent polyp recurrence after surgery. The effect on the polyp size is greater when INS are used in patients who have previ - ously undergone sinus surgery. Importantly, INS are a safe thera - py with minimal adverse effects in the management of both CRSsNP and CRSwNP. Systemic CS are effective for the management of CRSwNP but their use is limited to patients with se - vere or uncontrolled symptoms. A short-term benefit of a short (two to four-week) course of oral CS (OCS) when compared to placebo has been reported, with an objec - tive reduction of polyp size and a subjective improvement of nasal symptoms and quality of life.

MECHANISM OF CS ACTION CS achieve the reduction of nasal symptoms in most patients with CRS because they have power - ful anti-inflammatory effects. The clinical efficacy of CS depends in part on their ability to reduce air - way eosinophil infiltration by pre - venting their increased viability and activation. CS also have im - portant effects on the sino-nasal epithelial cells with reduction of the secretion of chemotactic cy - tokines and other proinflammato - ry mediators (Figure 2). The biological action of CS occurs after their binding to the intracel - lular CS receptors (GR) expressed in all human cells and tissues, in - cluding in the sinonasal mucosa. The CS-GR complex rapidly trans - locates into the nucleus and mod - ulates, either positively or neg - atively, the expression of target genes (Figure 3). Thus, CS activate the expression of several anti-in - flammatory genes, such as the 348GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION H - Chronic rhinosinusitis - diagnosis and managementEosinophil and cell numbers (apoptosis) Th2 cell cytokines (IL IL-5) cell cell effect of corticosteroids (CS) on the epithelium and submucosa of an eosinophilic nasal polyp tissue.

Macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin and azithromycin are the most studied antibiotics for CRS treatment. Apart from reducing the number of bacte - ria considered pathogens, oth - er mechanisms of action are not fully understood. Macrolide an - tibiotics have exhibited in vitro strong anti-inflammatory effects, on parity with prednisolone. The anti-inflammatory effects can also be demonstrated by measuring inflammatory mediators in nasal lavage fluid of patients, but if this is secondary to reduced bacterial load or a primary anti-inflamma - tory effect is not clear. A more speculative explanation is that an - tibiotics in long-term use prevent pathogenic bacteria to invade the epithelium. Reducing the number of toxins, such as those released by some Staphylococci species is another possible explanation. There are two placebo-controlled studies using long-term macrolide antibiotics in CRS with conflict - ing results.

In the other study the response rate (44 % in the azithromycin group and 28 % in the placebo group) did not reach sig - nificance. The difference between the results of the two studies can be explained by the inclusion cri - teria, the positive one including only CRS without polyps, whereas the negative one included CRS pa -tients with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) as well. The positive study showed that patients with normal serum IgE are more likely to respond to treatment (Figure 1).

In order to assess the role of im - mune modulation in CRS Pu - bmed/Embase and the Cochrane database were searched using the following terms: (Sinusitis or nasal polyp) and mepolizum - ab or omalizumab). In total 1103 abstracts were reviewed, and con - trolled trials and systematic re - views were retrieved.IMMUNE MODULATION IN CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS 7 KEY MESSAGES Immune modulation in chronic rhinosinusitisASPIRIN DESENSITISATION IN CRSw NP AND ASPIRIN EXACERBATED RESPIRATORY DISEASE Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is an eosinophil dominated inflammatory disease characterized by CRSwNP and asthma, caused by abnormalities in arachidonic acid metabolic pathway. Aspirin desensitisation, achieved through repetitive dosing with oral or top - ical nasal aspirin, has been used to reduce the re - currence of nasal polyps, occurring frequently. A sys -tematic review of the literature was published in 2013, summaris - ing 11 studies, of which 7 (all ob - servational cohort studies) recom - mended aspirin desensitization. However, only one study was a randomized trial of nasal lysine as - pirin and found no significant ben -Claire Hopkins Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals London, UK Figure 1 CT scan demonstrating typical features of AFS.353GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION H - Chronic rhinosinusitis - diagnosis and management efit. Two randomized controlled trials have been published since 2013 and both identified signifi - cant benefit from desensitization compared with placebo in terms of symptom scores, and one found a benefit in terms of reduced pol - yp recurrence and further surgery (the other did not report this). Both studies suffered from a high drop out rate (55 and 31%) in part due to adverse effects. The key outcomes of the trials reported are summarized in Table 1. Aspirin dosages used in published studies vary from 100 - 1100 mg per day, and only one trial has com - pared different dosages to date.Given the evidence retrieved there is a low GRADE recommendation for the use of aspirin desensitiza - tion for CRSwNP and AERD. The quality of evidence is high, howev - er there is a high risk of harm with high rates of adverse effect leading to drug discontinuation. IMMUNOTHERAPY IN ALLERGIC FUNGAL SINUSITIS Even if a strong immunological ba - sis for AFS was documented, there is a paucity of strong evidence supporting the use of immuno - therapy, and to date there are no placebo-controlled randomized trials. Two case-control studies, comparing a total of 47 patients undergoing immunotherapy with 35 controls, showed reduced cor - ticosteroid usage, reduced polyp recurrence and decreased need for repeated interventions in AFS patients receiving immunother - apy. A later study by the same group failed to detect a signifi - cant difference between active and control groups, but may have been underpowered (n=17). There has been some concern reported of the potential for adverse ef - fects due to immune complex deposition, however one recent small study found no difference in adverse events between AFS and CRS without fungal hypersensitiv - ity following high-dose immuno -TABLE 1 for in Symptom score and ACT25% Yes Fruth 20131b po 100 3sig imp on recurrence, grade and symptom scoresYes Havel 20132 po 500 >1.5sig imp in polyp symptom Yes Forer 20112 po 1050 1sig imp in olfaction but high drop out rate lead to low power37% Katial 2010 2 po 1100 0.5 sig imp in symptom scores 0% Yes Rozasi 20082 po100/ 3001300 mg - sig imp in symptom scores polyp grade and decreased surgery 100 mg no benefit0% Yes Lee 20072 po1100/ 6501Sig imp in symptom score, reduction in surgery steroid usage1100 mg=12% 650 mg=20%Yes Berges-Gi - meno 20032 po 1100 1Sig imp in symptom score, reduction in surgery and steroid usage24% Yes Gosepath 20012 po 100 1 no statistical analysis 0% ?

Larger, randomized trials are required to assess both safety and efficacy. All studies to date have assessed the response to im - munotherapy in the early post-op - erative period, with the exception of one study in which 5 patients who received treatment prior to surgery underwent radiological and symptomatic deterioration during treatment. Therefore, im - munotherapy should be seen as an adjunct to surgery, which re - mains the primary treatment mo - dality, removing the allergic mucin (Figure 2) and opening the sinuses to topical therapy. Given the evidence retrieved there is a low GRADE recommen - dation for the use of immunother - apy for AFS based on low quality of evidence and low risk of harm. ALLERGEN SPECIFIC IMMUNOTHERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH CRS AND ALLERGIC RHINITIS Only 3 case control studies have evaluated the benefit of allergen specific immunotherapy (AIT) for inhalant allergens in patients with co-morbid CRS and allergic rhinitis (AR) with respect to CRS outcomes. All reported better CRS outcomes in patients receiving AIT for their AR after sur - gery, but have significant methodological flaws or lack adequate statistical analysis, such that no conclusions on the ben - efits of AIT on symptoms of CRS in patients with AR can be made. Given the evidence re - trieved there is a low GRADE recommenda - tion to NOT recommend AIT in patients with CRS and AR for CRS out - comes alone. The recom - mendation is based on low quality of evidence and low risk of harm. SPECIFIC IMMUNOMODULATION WITH MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES Omalizumab, an anti-IgE mono - clonal antibody (mAb) has been used in 2 placebo controlled RCTs. One study randomised 14 patients with CRS (12 of whom had CRSwNP) and a history of prior surgery to active or placebo treatment and found no benefit in terms of radiological or symptom scores at 6 months. The second study included 24 patients with CRSwNP and asthma, and found that polyp grade, symptom and ra - diological scores improved signifi - cantly with omalizumab compared with placebo. One patient receiv - ing active treatment developed lymphoma one year after complet - ing the trial, however pooled data form asthma trials do not support a causal link of omalizumab with malignancy. There is an isolated case-report supporting the use of omalizumab in AFS. One placebo controlled ran - domised controlled trial has demonstrated significantly great - er reduction in polyp size and ra -diological scores in patients with CRSwNP receiving mepolizumab, an anti-IL-5 mAb, when compared with placebo. Long-term data on mAb safety is required, and patient selection needs to be better defined before recommending widespread use of an expensive drug. Given the evidence retrieved there is a low GRADE recommen - dation to NOT recommend mAbs for CRA outside of trials. The rec - ommendation is based on high quality of evidence and unknown risk of harm in association with high cost of treatment KEY REFERENCES 1. Xu JJ, Sowerby L, Rotenberg BW.

Outcome of ESS for CRS has been further improved by employing post-operative med - ical therapy including intranasal corticosteroids and low-dose long-term macrolide therapy (Fig - ure 2). Recently, the incidence of CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), which relates to significant eosin - ophilic infiltration on sinus muco - sa, is increasing. CRSwNP tends to show post-operative recurrence of mucosal lesion accompanied by recurrent nasal polyposis (NP), al - though patient's subjective symp - toms are usually improved. To reduce the frequency of NP recurrence, thorough removal of pathological tissues, especially complete removal of ethmoidal air cells, is required in order to make post-operative local treatments, e.g., topical steroids and sinus rinse, easier. Residual ethmoidal air cells affects outcomes of ESS, because these cells may become a focus of persistent inflammation and/or polyp growth. Another key for better EES outcome is to do \"mucosal preservation surgery\"3) (Figure 3).

Actual surgical steps are as fol - lows: 1. Nasal polypectomy. NP often derive from the middle meatus and olfactory cleft. These NP should be removed from the bottom. 2. Ethmoidal surgery. Under - standing of the location of unci - nate process, bulla ethmoidalis, ground lamellae and superior turbinate is important since they serve as an anatomic land - mark during the operation. The bone septa in the ethmoid air cells are sufficiently excised to make them as smooth as possi - ble, and a unique cavity is cre - ated. 3. Maxillary surgery. The maxillary sinus is inspected with an an - gled endoscopy, then a curved forceps is inserted through widen maxillary fontanelle to remove the pathologic tissues. 4. Sphenoidal surgery. Entering the sphenoid sinus from natural ostium and posterior ethmoid sinus is recommended with removal of the pathological le - sions in the sphenoid sinus, but it is not preferable to remove forcibly a mucosal lesion from lateral or posterior wall 5. Frontal surgery. The approach to a frontal sinus lesion is the most difficult step in ESS. The use of an angled endoscope to look up at frontal recess from below is recommended, since it allows the recognition of the drainage pathway. The angled forceps is inserted carefully to the frontal sinus, and the drainage pathway is enlarged as much as possible. Draf type II or III are chosen to the case of revision surgery or the case of short anterior-posterior di - ameter. Inappropriate and rough manip - ulation during the surgery may cause major complications such as orbital injury and cerebrospi -nal fluid leakage4.

Few studies have also compared medical versus sur - gical treatment for chronic sinus disease. These studies, including a Cochrane review, show that medi - cal and surgical treatment can lead to similar effects in improving qual - ity of life. Although these trials pro - vide us an interesting insight into the relative efficacies of medical versus surgical therapy they don't provide us sufficient evidence. The comparison medical versus surgical therapy does not reflect current guidelines as it is general - ly accepted that for both CRSwNP and CRSsNP surgical intervention is only considered in patients who fail to improve after a trial of maxi - mal medical treatment. If a patient with CRS is consid - ered for surgery it should not be thought of as the only treatment. ESS is rather a surgical technique that decreases the amount of in - flammation and creates acces - sible sinus cavities so that the medical treatment may become more effective. This concept has been proven in CRSwNP patients INTERFACING MEDICAL AND SURGICAL MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS 10 KEY MESSAGESThibaut Van Zele Ghent University Hospital Ghent, Belgium where patients with previous si - nus surgery responded to topical steroid greater than patients with - out sinus surgery for nasal polyp (NP) size reduction. Patients with NP appear to receive the most benefit of postoperative topical steroids as polyp recurrence rate was reduced and time to polyp recurrence was lengthened. For CRSsNP it is less clear if surgical intervention affects the sympto - matic response to a topical ster - oid. Recent evidence also sup - ports the claim that ESS improves the delivery of topical medications to the sinonasal mucosa, however it should be noted that large vol - ume squeeze bottles or passive flow devices appear to have the best sinus penetration rate. The fact that there is an important interplay between medical and surgical therapy is also reflected during the immediate periopera - tive period after ESS. Administra - tion of systemic steroids in the perioperative period for patients who have polyps has a significant impact on their postoperative course. Topical steroids have been shown to improve wound healing after ESS. For antibiotics (both lo - cal and systemic) there is conflict - ing evidence. Two studies evalu - ating a short and long course of postoperative antibiotics (2 days) demonstrated it had no effect on outcomes, while a third study with a long postoperative antibiotic protocol demonstrated showed a improvement in patient symp - toms, endoscopic appearance and significant reduction in sinonasal crust formation.

Interfacing medical and surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis363GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION H - Chronic rhinosinusitis - diagnosis and management Treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a challenge. Pa rt of the challenge is that CRS represents the end point of multiple e tiologic processes that are influenced by genes, environment and age The unifying theme for CRS treatment is that inflammation needs to be controlled, acute infections need to be treated wi th antibiotics, and surgery is reserved for medical failures There is large numbers of treatments mentioned in the literature, but there are limited evidence-based publicati ons that support the various treatments Many patients do not respond to treatment as indicated by t he guidelines CRS treatment guidelines are mostly based on expert opin ion, do not consider the response to prior treatment or the management of exacerbations, tend to eliminate certain CRS subtypes and d o not consider the underlying disease mechanismsCurrent guidelines tend to divide chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) into that with and that without na - sal polyps (NP). The guidelines base treatment on the severity of the disease. Unfortunately, most guidelines do not consider the re - sponse to prior treatment or the management of exacerbations (Table 1). They tend to eliminate certain subtypes such as cystic fibrosis (CF), antrochoanal polyps, aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD, fungal disease (al - lergic and invasive) and complica - tions. Furthermore, children differ from adults in their pathophysi - ology and thus require different treatment strategies. The goals of treatment are to eliminate or reduce NP size, re - store nasal breathing, restore the sense of smell, reduce symptoms of rhinitis, reduce the number of bacterial infections, and prevent recurrence. In addition, there are suggestions that treatment of CRS improves asthma. The unifying theme for CRS treat - ment is that inflammation needs to be controlled, acute infections need to be treated with antibi - otics, and surgery is reserved for medical failures (Figure 1).THE CHALLENGES OF CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS MANAGEMENT 11 KEY MESSAGES Treatment with anti-inflamma - tory drugs is the mainstay, with drugs being given either primarily or secondarily after surgery to slow the rate of recurrence. Because of their anti-inflammatory prop - erties, corticosteroids have been the pillars of treatment. Topical intranasal corticosteroids (INS) are more effective for CRS with polyps than for CRS without polyps. Many clinicians call for more studies re - garding the delivery system, to ensure a better distribution of the INS throughout the nose and si - nuses. This has been highlighted by the delivery of corticosteroid nasal drops, which reduced the need for surgical intervention in a group of patients who had previously re - ceived standard INS. Experience has led to the use of Pulmicort respules\u00ae in a Sinusrinse\u00ae bottle in the attempt to deliver a large volume of fluid containing a topi - cal corticosteroid into previously operated sinuses and corticos - teroid impregnated stents placed at the time of surgery. Oral ster - oids given over 2 to 4 weeks have been shown to reduce NP size and symptoms, but the optimum dose The challenges of chronic rhinosinusitis managementRobert Naclerio Fuad Baroody University of Chicago Chicago, USA364GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION H - Chronic rhinosinusitis - diagnosis and managementhas not been established. In chil - dren, oral methylprednisolone add - ed to amoxicillin/clavulanate in the treatment of CRS, improves symp - toms and the inflammatory chang - es on CT scans. The usual clinical treatment of NP is to give oral ster - oids followed by INS. Intrapolyp injections of steroids were popu - lar until the 1960s, when resulting cases of blindness were reported. Now, this approach has been revis - ited because some authors report no incidence of blindness with the use of fine suspensions of steroid particles and pre-decongestion. The authors suggest some effec - tiveness for 4 to 8 weeks and some systemic absorption. Surgery is clearly indicated for intracranial and intraorbital com - plications, mucoceles, anatomic variations, allergic fungal disease, massive polyps with bony remode - ling, and antrochoanal polyps. The category leading to the majority of surgical interventions, however, is that of patients who remain symp - tomatic despite medical treatment. Overall, the number of patients requiring surgery is very low. This conservative approach to surgi - cal intervention followed a study showing no difference between medical treatment (INS, douching, and long-term erythromycin) and surgery followed by INS. In support of surgical intervention are the excellent subjective rates of im - provement in long-term follow-up. Unilateral surgery showed better CT findings, olfaction, polyp score, and relief of symptoms on the op - erated side. Several quality-of-life instruments showed better im - provement in patients electing sur - gery compared to those electing continued medical therapy. The best surgical approach has been debated. The currently favored procedure is an extensive surgical clean-out to provide access for topical medicines postoperatively. This concept builds upon the view that INS slow the rate of post sur - gery recurrence. Surgical revision rates have increased for cases of AERD, asthma, and frontal-sinus disease. Surgery in children is al - most done exclusively in patients with CF and those with orbital and intracranial complications. The first surgical approach for children is an adenoidectomy plus/minus a max - illary sinus wash. The goals of the use of antibiotics are to eliminate infection, reduce inflammation, and clear biofilms. The use of topical antibiotics lacks good studies on safety, particular - ly regarding systemic effects: only 1 of 7 randomized, placebo-con - trolled studies showed a positive effect. Mupirocin, used in an open study, showed positive effects in Staphylococcus aureus -positive pa - tients. Oral antibiotics have been used short-term for treatment of acute episodes of CRS. Studies of the long-term use of antibiotics for their anti-inflammatory prop - erties have had mixed results. In total, topical antifungals have not been shown to be effective in the treatment of CRS.Because patients have persistent symptoms, besides the above ap - proaches a multitude of other strategies have been suggested. These include oral and topical an - tihistamines, leukotriene receptor antagonists, 5 lipooxygenase 5 and other aeroaller - gens, large-volume irrigations with or without drugs, methotrexate, topical and oral antifungal drugs, decongestants, mucolytics, photo - therapy, protein pump inhibitors, massage sinus ostea with swabs of botanical es - sential oils, air purifiers, and diets, as well as aspirin desensitization orally or intranasal The vast major - ity of the use of these treatments is supported by individual experi - ence, and they place emphasis on the group of patients for whom we do not have effective treatment. In summary, the design and in - terpretation of CRS clinical trials have been hindered by the inher - ent heterogeneity of the disease, a lack of uniform definitions for the various subtypes, an incomplete understanding of the underlying pathologies, the use of rescue medications, and a lack of useful and standardized clinical and labo - ratory endpoints for measurement of the response to therapy.

Evidence based studies support the use of systemic steroids followed by topical steroids and saline irrigations for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). For patients without nasal polyps (CRSsNP), most evidence supports saline irrigations and intranasal steroids. Antibiotics are reserved for the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of the disease with less evidence to support the prolonged use of antibiotics for their anti-inflammatory properties. If the patients respond to the treatment regimen, it should be continued with close clinical follow up. If they do not respond, then a sinus CT scan followed by endoscopic sinus surgery is offered followed by maintenance of a disease free cavity postoperatively with the use of saline irrigations and intranasal steroids. Other less supported agents such as Anti-IgE and Doxycycline for CRSwNP, oral steroids for CRSsNP, and mucolytics, LTRAs, etc can be considered if conventional therapy does not lead to a response.

The Action Plan B3 of the EIP on AHA is de - voted to integrated care pathways for chronic diseases across the life cycle. The integrated care path- ways for airways diseases (AIR - WAYS ICPs) has been chosen as the model of chronic diseases. Its goals are to launch a collabora - tion to develop multisectoral care pathways for chronic respiratory diseases in European countries and regions, and beyond with the Global Alliance against respiratory diseases (GARD). One of the ma- jor actions of AIRWAYS ICPs is to launch care pathways for chronic respiratory diseases, which can be applied at the national and region- al levels in Europe. ARIA (Allergic Rhinitis and its Im- pact on Asthma) represents the most widely used guideline for allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma comorbidity. ARIA comprises a study group of 350 members and has been disseminated in over 65 countries to specialists, general practitioners, pharmacists, other health care professionals, social carers and, importantly, patients. ARIA: FROM A GUIDELINE TO A CARE PATHWAY (AIRWAYS ICPS) 2 KEY MESSAGES ARIA is disseminated in over 60 countries and has been translated into over 50 languages. Further- more, it has been used in several guidelines recommended by gov - ernmental health agencies (e.g. Brazil Portugal, Singapore, and the Finnish Allergy Programme). The importance of clinical guide - lines is widely recognized, but confusion exists on terminologies used to describe various forms of evidence-based tools to inform clinical practice.A best practice is a technique, method, process, activity, incen- tive, or reward that is believed to be more effective at delivering a particular outcome than any oth- er technique, method, process, etc. when applied to a particu- lar condition or circumstance. A best practice can be adopted as a standard process or be used as a guideline (U.S. Dept. of Veterans Affairs). A guideline is a statement to de - termine a course of action. It aims to streamline particular process-Jean Bousquet Pascal Demoly ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION I - Global strategy for the management of allergic rhinitis and chronic rhinosinusitises according to a set routine or sound practice. By definition, fol- lowing a guideline is never man - datory. Guidelines are not binding and are not enforced. Clinical practice guidelines are systematically developed state- ments to assist the practitioner and patient decisions about ap- propriate health care for specific clinical circumstances. (Institute of Medicine, 1990). Clinical prac- tice guidelines define the role of specific diagnostic and treatment modalities in the diagnosis and management of patients. The statements contain recommenda - tions that are based on evidence derived from a rigorous systemat - ic review and synthesis of the pub - lished medical literature. Clinical practice guidelines are not fixed protocols that must be followed, but are intended for health care professionals and providers to consider. While they identify and describe generally recommended courses of intervention, they are not presented as a substitute for the advice of a physician or other knowledgeable health care pro - fessional or provider. The integrated care pathway (ICP) concept was initiated in 1985 by Zander and Bower. ICPs are structured multidisciplinary care plans which detail essential steps in the care of patients with a specific clinical problem. They promote the translation of guide- lines into local protocols and their subsequent application to clinical practice. An ICP forms all or part of the clinical record, documents the care given, and facilitates the evaluation of outcomes for contin- uous quality improvement. ICPs can help empower patients and their carers (health and social). ICPs differ from clinical practice guidelines as they are utilized by a multidisciplinary team and have a focus on the quality and co-ordi- nation of care. ICPs need to have a mechanism for recording vari - ations/deviations from planned care. An ICP is intended to act as a guide to treatment. Clinicians are thus free to exercise their own professional judgments as appro- priate. However, any alteration to the practice identified within this ICP must be noted as a variance. Variance analysis is a critical part of developing and using ICPs. The resulting analysis can be used to amend the ICP itself if, for the ma - jority of patients, the practice is different to the pathway (Table 1). The new ARIA strategy is to devel - op recommendations which will be used globally and applicable to each individual region or coun - try of Europe depending on the health system, the cultural barri - ers, the availability and reimburse - ment of treatments and diagnosis, patients and health care profes- sionals views. They will therefore represent the link between guide - lines and care pathways. The ARIA care pathway document will be launched during a meeting at the Ministry of Health of Por - tugal, July 1-2, 2015 organised by the R\u00e9gion Languedoc Roussillon, the Reference Site Network of the EIP on AHA and the Directorate General of Health of Portugal in collaboration with WHO GARD (Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases). Scientific societies like EAACI will partici- pate to this launch.KEY REFERENCES 1. Bousquet J, Michel J, Standberg T, Crooks G, Iakovidis I, Gomez M.

Actually the title of the paper was really self explaining, since it was devoted to identify the unmet needs in this pathologi - cal condition. Among the different phenotypes of rhinitis, infectious and allergic rhinitis (AR) are those that are best characterized from a pathophysiologic point of view. AR is sometimes considered a trivial disease and is neglected, although its economical burden is over 2000 \u20ac per patient per year. These costs should be multiplied by a remark - able number of patients, since the prevalence of AR is quite relevant, so the real socioeconomic burden of AR is even higher. In real life, the majority of patients had per - sistent symptoms (73%), and AR of moderate-severe degree (70%). The majority of patients with AR present with controlled symptoms during treatment, but many pa - tients suffer from SCUAD. SCUAD defines those patients who remain uncontrolled despite adequate (i.e. effective, safe and acceptable) pharmacologic treatment based on guidelines (ARIA & EPOS). SCUAD accounts for 10-18% of AR pa - tients ondergoing treatment.SEVERE CHRONIC UPPER AIRWAY DISEASES 3 KEY MESSAGES It can be envisaged that the di - agnostic/therapeutic approach is not supporting a correct treat- ment to AR patients, so they are worsening and developing a SCUAD. Patients may not under- stand the benefits from treatment and compliance to treatment is poor. A substantial proportion of such patients do not reach opti- mal pharmacological treatment. SCUAD patients are likely to have impaired quality-of-life including social functioning, sleep, school and/or work performances. Although quite a few patients with AR are not sufficiently con- trolled by current treatments in clinical practice, the prevalence of uncontrolled rhinitis and its impact on quality-of-life or work are unknown. In reality, patients with AR reach optimal health-re-lated quality of life (HRQoL) in just one third of cases, mainly due to comorbid asthma, while unsatis- factory disease control was the primary reason why the individu - als remaining from one third failed to attain optimal HRQoL. Impacting limitations in daily life is reported for 45% of AR patients in a recent study in Italy, and 61% of AR patients are worried about possible unfavorable evolution of the disease. In real life, sadely, AR patients use automedications first, referring to the general practioner in a small percentage and of course even less to specialists. A recent survey conducted in Italy detected that the majority of AR patients use more then one single drug; 36% use two drugs; 13% three drugs and 6% more than three drugs. So, it is reasonable to suggest that quite a few SCUAD patients are Walter G. Canonica University of Genova Italy374GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION I - Global strategy for the management of allergic rhinitis and chronic rhinosinusitisnot even suspected or detected and that SCUAD is possibly under - estimated in real life. Recent data of the ISMAR study, performed in different parts of the world, suggested an extensive clin - ical use of guidelines (Figure 1). However, it was recently demon - strated that although \"ARIA in the Pharmacy\" program was dissem - inated, just 13% of pharmacists, are aware of the ARIA Guidelines. This approach is not anymore structured in real life as it was proposed in the educational pro- grams. New initiatives are needed, such as the Contre les Maladies (MACVIA-LR) of their severity and socioeconomic con - sequences, SCUADs need special attention to better define its prev- alence and mechanisms. Priori- ties for research in SCUADs can be listed as: definition of geno- types/phenotypes in relation to disease heterogeneity, immune responses (innate and specific), and inflammation; assessment of prevalence, burden, and costs of different causes of SCUADs; as- sessment of SCUAD comorbidi - of treatment; longitudinal evalua- tion of SCUADs to find preventive strategies. Because of the economic impact, some Regulatory Bodies are re - stricting the reimbursement of Allergen immunotherapy ( AIT) mainly to SCUAD. This is a further reason to promote phenotypic characterisation and stratifica- tion of allergic patients, charac- terisation of SCUAD patients and characterisation of AR patients to be treated by AIT. In this re- spect, three innovative tools (AIR- WAYS-ICP, the allergy sentinel network and AIRWAYS-CDSS) will be combined in the MACVIA-AR- IA Sentinel NetworK (MASK) and will make it possible to assess some of the unmet needs in re - search of AIT (Table 1). The final remark should be con- sistent with the previous data on SCUADs, since because of their severity and socioeconomic con - sequences, SCUADs need special Figure 1 Use of guidelines reported by physicians [Number and percentage of physicians].

However, a signifi- cant number of patients with AR and CRS continue to experience bothersome symptoms despite adequate treatment. This group, the so-called severe chronic up- per airway disease (SCUAD) rep - resents a continuous therapeutic challenge. Further research re- garding the diagnostic, therapeu- tic and patient-related factors that are responsible for uncontrolled upper airway diseases are needed. Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is already an available causal treat - ment for AR. Subcutaneous immu- notherapy (SCIT) is in most cases effective in the short term (3-4 years). However, its long-term ef- ficacy is still unclear. Recent data indicate that sublingual immuno - therapy (SLIT) is an effective treat- ment modality for seasonal AR but head-to-head studies comparing SLIT to SCIT are needed. SCIT and SLIT are both safe and effective treatments for AR, but strict com -IMPORTANT RESEARCH QUESTIONS IN CHRONIC UPPER AIRWAYS DISEASES 4 KEY MESSAGES pliance is crucial to achieve good clinical effects. There is, conse- quently, a need for further identi- fication of potential obstacles and of measures that will enhance a better compliance in AIT. Non-allergic rhinitis (NAR) can be defined as chronic nasal symp- toms that are not caused by IgE-dependent mechanisms or re- lated to structural anomalies. Sev- eral causes include hormonal im - balance, physical/chemical agents, psychological factors, air pollution and certain drugs. Taking into ac- count the heterogeneity of NAR there is a need for better under- standing of the pathophysiology of the disease and its risk factors, Paul Van Cauwenberge Hanne Vanmaele Gent University Belgium377GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION I - Global strategy for the management of allergic rhinitis and chronic rhinosinusitisto guide us toward an improved diagnosis and therapy. Local allergic rhinitis (LAR) is char- acterized by the presence of a nasal Th2 inflammatory response with local production of specific IgE antibodies and a positive re- sponse to a nasal allergen prov - ocation test without evidence of systemic atopy. According to one report the prevalence of LAR tends to be up to 25% in subjects affected with persistent rhinitis presenting a comorbidity and the clinical pattern similar to AR. The real prevalence of LAR in the gen- eral population remains, however, unknown and is probably overes - timated. With regard to chronic rhinosinus - itis (CRS) with and without nasal polyps, there is a further need for larger randomised placebo-con- trolled trials investigating the ef- fect of existing and novel medical therapy. A better understanding of the pathogenesis and factors enhancing mucosal inflammation is crucial for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic tools. The main objective for fu- ture research should be the iden - tification of clinical parameters, infectious agents, inflammato- ry mechanisms and remodelling processes in patients with upper airway disease, so that those pa - tients can be categorized into clin- ically relevant subgroups based on clinical phenotyping and biomark - er profiles. Defining and predict- ing response to therapy in individ - ual CRS patients is a challenge for future research. KEY REFERENCES 1.

The Primary Care Physicians need organiz ed education to improve their skills for the diagnostics and management of rhinoconjunctivitis and rhinosinusitis Allergy testing centers should be formed in public health car e to serve all practitioners in the region. This is for better quality of the testing itself as well as for proper result interpretation National or regional Allergy Plans are recommended to improv e the care of multifaceted allergic conditions. Local groups of experts and stakeholders decide the division of labour, supervise the management processes and follow up results as well as costsPRACTITIONER LEVEL The vast majority of all allergy patients are managed by the gen- eral practitioners (GP) (or gen- eral allergists) in the outpatient care. This work is supplemented by ENT-specialist -, and hospi- tal based care, if extensive rhi - noscopic examinations, CT-scan or surgery are needed. Every GP or general allergist should have the equipment to perform sim - ple anterior rhinoscopy as well as otoscopy. The GPs should detect severe mucosal inflammation, infectious secretion, polyposis, obvious tumors and marked an - atomical changes like septum deviation. The GPs should have an easy access to x-rays or ultra- sound examination to diagnose sinusitis and mucosal swelling. Many GPs are also able to drain maxillary sinuses. Management of allergic upper air - ways conditions is not taking place in a vacuum. If the patient is atopic, often lung -, skin -, and sometimes gastrointestinal symptoms co-ex - ist. These co-morbidities need at - tention to control the common in - flammatory condition (Table 1).

For mild rhinoconjunc- tivitis, guided self-management and follow-up are generally suffi- cient. Extensive diagnostic exam-inations should be performed if the symptoms continue, become more severe and cause disability or marked inconvenience.Tari Haahtela Helsinki University Hospital Finland TABLE 1 How to improve the management of rhinitis and asthma Allergic rhinitis is treated betterAsk asthma symptoms in every rhinitis patient.

Severe symptoms cause the majority of costs, which can be considerably reduced by pre - ventive and good symptom con- trol (Figure 1). Diagnostic allergy practices vary greatly between countries and even in the same country. The GPs should be able to refer their patients to simple skin prick test- ing to common allergens. The test answers to two basic questions: 1) does the patient have an atopic disposition (any positive, at least 3 mm wheal reaction), 2) is there a causal relationship of any of the tested allergen and current symp - toms? In the Finnish Allergy Programme 2008-2018 public health allergy testing is centralized to large hos- pitals, which give testing service to the whole region, also to GPs. This strategy has considerably im -proved the quality of testing and interpretation of results. Diag- nosing the upper airway allergies needs precision and both under- and over-diagnostics should be watched. The former causes un- necessary suffering and the latter overuse of drugs. As improving immune tolerance is increasingly emphasized in mod - ern allergy treatment, the patients should have a better access to allergen immunotherapy (AIT). This is now feasible when AIT in - jections are more and more turn- ing to sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) with tablets and drops. An allergy trained GP should be able to start SLIT and follow it up. It is crucial that the management chains and processes are regional - ly thought over, written down and organized between GPs, allergy testing centers and specialist care units. Basically: who is doing what and when? A national or region - al \"Allergy Plan\" is very useful in facilitating comprehensive allergy care and co-operation between different healthcare units with the aim of better management and less costs.

However, the exact roles of these factors in the inception of AR and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) are not clear. The rapid increase of AR with urbanization clearly suggests the importance of environmen - tal factors in the development of AR. The implicated factors include indoor and outdoor allergen expo - sure, environmental air pollutants including tobacco smoke expo - sure, and indoor humidity (Figure 1). The most important predispos- ing factor for rhinosinusitis is AR and adequate treatment of AR will reduce the burden of rhinosinus - itis. Effective implementation of public policies regarding pollution, building codes, city planning and planting practices many help to reduce the burden of AR and CRS. OUTDOOR ENVIRONMENT Many outdoor environmental pol - lutants, including ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and partic - ulate matter, can induce sino-nasal mucosal irritation and inflamma - tion. Much of these pollutants are generated from burning of bio - mass fuels and exhausts of motor vehicles.

Human studies corroborated the experi - mental findings documenting the association of outdoor ozone con - centration and leucocytes in nasal secretions in a dose-dependent manner. Exposure to particular matter related to diesel exposure has been shown to increase upper airway expression of inflammatory cytokines. As there are no clear-cut thresholds of safety level for vari - ous pollutants in relation to airway diseases, public policies should aim to reduce these pollutants to the lowest possible levels (Table 1). Exposure to pollen is another ma - jor risk factor for the development of AR. Due the increasing demand for green space in modern cities careful consideration during ur- ban planning is needed for the selection of plant species thereby minimizing aeroallergen concen - tration. Due to the phenomenon of global warming, the distribution and dispersion of various grass or tree related pollens are likely to change and may result in increase of AR across the world. Detailed environmental monitoring will be needed to document the effects of global warming. INDOOR ENVIRONMENT Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) can damage the sino-nasal mucosa by local irritation and immune-re - lated effects. In human studies, ex - posure to ETS has been found to be associated with increased prev - alence of CRS. Active smoking has also been shown to increase the personal risk of developing chronic rhinitis. Public policies in reducing secondhand tobacco smoke expo - sure will likely to be associated with benefits in subjects prone to devel - op chronic rhinitis. Indoor environmental allergens, including house dust mites, pet al - lergens, and mold allergens, have been widely implicated to be the major factors associated with AR. Poor ventilation and excessive humidity in households result in excessive growth of indoor molds and house dust mites thereby af - fecting susceptible individuals. Public policies governing building codes and control of indoor hu - midity are likely to be translated into health benefits with reduc- tion of morbidity due to AR.OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE Occupational rhinitis refers to symptoms of the upper airways due to exposure to irritants or allergens at the workplace. Al- though it is not as well character - ized as occupational asthma, it is more likely to be underdiagnosed and more research is needed in the area. The implicated occupa- tional agents are usually classified as low (<5 kDa) or high (>5 kDa) molecular weight agents (HMW or LMW). HMW agents refer to biological substance such as latex, laboratory animals, or flour. LMW agents are usually synthetic chem- icals such as those found in hair bleachings, epoxy resins, or drugs which can act as immune sensi - tizer. Symptoms typically would improve during holidays but get worse upon return to work. Public policies in setting standards at work places aiming to reduce exposure to the related occupa - tional agents will help in the pri- mary and secondary prevention of work related AR.

In the general population rhinitis is frequently under recognised and managed sub optimally. The pharmacist is often the first per- son an individual encounters when seeking alleviation from the symptoms of chronic upper air - ways problems, the most common varieties of which are persistent allergic and non - allergic rhinitis.

Should the patient not respond, it is suggested that he is signpost - ed to his general practioner (GP). Mild allergic rhinitis (AR) is usual- ly managed at pharmacy level the result of which is that the major- ity of those presenting in prima- ry care have moderate or severe disease (Figure 1). In all instances of airways disease, it is wise to en - quire about the presence of lower airways symptoms and in particu- lar asthma A major confounding factor is the presence of non AR, which has a number of aetiologies, on which treatment success relies on iden - tification and removal of the aeti- ological agent (Figure 2). The role of the GP is thus to take a comprehensive, allergy focused clinical history, which will include seeking a history of precipitating, exacerbating and relieving factors, any co-morbidities, in particu- lar asthma and any medications which have been tried as well as prescriptions for other problems such as hypertension, contracep - tion or pain relief; this will be ac- companied by a relevant physical examination in particular search- ing for signs of remediable prob - lems such as deviated nasal sep - tum and polyps, which may point to salicylate sensitivity. In all instances, exposure to ciga - rette smoke is deleterious and ces- sation advice should be offered. Having made as precise a diag - nosis as possible a management plan will be drawn up informed by relevant guidelines. It is important to recognize that AR and non AR may co exist.

Blood tests ( specific IgE) or skin prick tests, guided by an appropriate clinical history can be helpful in determining manage - ment for those with poorly con - trolled or persistent symptoms. Results should be interpreted in the context of the clinical histo - ry. Patient centered care, with shared decision making about the different treatment options, after exploring the patient's ideas con- cerns and expectations is encour- aged to ensure good compliance and improve outcomes.

A full exploration of the approach to management of CRS is offered by the European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyposis (EPOS) 2012. It is likely that future models of care will implement management strategies with the patient at the center of any management path - way facilitating the escalation of care to those with greater levels of expertise and resources needed, within an appropriate time frame if symptoms are failing to come under control (Figure 3).

Patient organ- isations aim to promote practical prevention and improve the quali- ty of life (QoL) for people affected by health conditions and for their families, through patient partici- pation and empowerment. Allergic rhinitis (AR) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) affect millions of people in Europe, and billions in the world, in their QoL, with - out them realising it. Not only the general public but also patients perceive \"hay fever\" as something that causes minor disruptions and bearable complaints, and the ones who suffer from this disease most- ly accept the reduction in quality of life due to AR and CRS. It is per- ceived as something that just be- longs to life and we cope with the discomfort. In general the patient and the general public are not aware that they can live life to the fullest, just by treating the disease and managing its triggers. These chronic inflammatory dis - eases of the upper airways do have a significant impact on the individ - ual, the family and work. On a soci - etal level the impact lies in the loss THE ROLE OF PATIENT ORGANISATIONS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS 8 KEY MESSAGES of workdays due to absence and loss of work effectiveness, thus generating a significant economic burden of annually more than sev - eral billions of Euros on employers and disease-related health care.

Swiss Allergy Centre are mostly non-profit organizations that rep - resent centres of excellence in the allergy field. They focus on the re - actions of the airways, digestive system and skin to environmental allergens and irritants, thus also on allergic rhinitis (AR). For the sake of creating awareness and take al - lergy preventive messages to the population, they seek visible public presence. Patient organizations are independent contact points for al - lergy sufferers and carers, but also for other interested groups such as the media, companies, training centres, politics, authorities and as - sociations. The services they offer range from advising individuals and training courses, providing infor - mation, organizing self help groups through to prevention projects and campaigns for the population at large. These offerings are often made possible by widespread na - tional and international networks and close co-operations with lead - ing experts and professional bod - ies in the relevant spheres. Most patient organizations work on the assumption that allergy sufferers are self-empowering and take re - sponsibility for themselves.COMPREHENSIVE MANAGEMENT PLAN IN ALLERGIC RHINITIS - TOWARDS A PATIENT-CENTERED ATTITUDE 9 KEY MESSAGES AIMS Patient organizations want allergy sufferers and their families to have access to relevant, up-to-date and sound knowledge at the time and in the complexity, depth and form they need it in their respective situation. Sufferers shall have the skills, life circumstances and sup - port they need to live their lives as symptom-free as possible and with a consistently high quality of life. The stakeholders in society shall take on their share of respon - sibility for the health-related living conditions and quality of life of all humans. SERVICES To achieve these aims, patient or-ganizations offer sufferers, carers and other groups very well estab - lished services in the field of res- piratory allergies and AR which are listed below.

They campaign for high-quality, broadly accessible services such as prima - ry prevention, with focus on living conditions and lifestyle and sec- ondary prevention by improving patients and career skills. Aided by modern quality development, they strive for best professional practice.TOWARDS A PATIENT- CENTERED ATTITUDE In a global perspective, the num - ber of sufferers from AR steadily increases. The diversity of known allergic diseases and allergens in - creases. At the same time, there is growing evidence that person - alized measures are key for suc - cessful prevention and therapy of allergies. In parallel to this, it is increasingly difficult to raise funds for patient organization activi - ties. Today, allergy patient organ - izations are heavily challenged by these facts. By choosing the ideal mixture of mass media communi - cation (online and print), smart - phone applications and individual advising on a one-to-one or one- to-few basis, this challenge has to be and will be mastered effi - ciently. In addition, online-based self-monitoring tools and person - alized website surfaces can sup - port patient-centered measures against the AR epidemic (Figure 2).

Multidisciplinary inte- grated care is necessary to reduce the burden of chronic diseases. A significant proportion of patients with rhinitis self-manage the con- dition and often the pharmacist is the first healthcare professional that a person with nasal complains contacts. Pharmacists are trusted in the community and are easy to access. As such, pharmacists are an important part of the multidis- ciplinary healthcare team acting at different steps of rhinitis care pathways. Pharmacists are important in many areas of intervention in al- lergic rhinitis (AR): 1) Recognizing (identification) 2) Risk assessment/stratification 3) Over-the-counter treatment 4) Patient education 5) Referral to a physician 6) Teaching the technique for topical treatment and ensur - ing adherence to treatment A good awareness of the phar - macist for recognizing AR and its main co-morbidities is mandatory to offer to the patient stratifica-THE ROLE OF PHARMACISTS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC UPPER AIRWAY DISEASES 10 KEY MESSAGES tion of risk severity, and co-mor- bities assessment (e.g. asthma). Simple algorithms and tools are essential to routine implementa- tion of these steps. Standardized and validated tools are available to assess the diagnosis of AR, to rec - ognize an urgent medical referral (eg unilateral bleeding), to assess rhinitis severity, impact on the pa- tient's quality of life and control (Figure 1). A simple visual ana- logue scale (VAS) on the bother - some of nasal symptoms has been shown to be a sensitive tool for quantitative evaluation of severity of AR. VAS is highly responsive to change during treatment and very quick to complete, making it ideal for daily or frequent monitoring of AR. In addition The Control of Allergic Rhinitis and Asthma Test (CARAT) can help identify patients with uncontrolled rhinitis and/ or asthma in pharmacy settings. These and other tools can help pharmacists to give optimal ad- vice for patients with rhinitis. This advice can be over-the-counter treatment, topical treatment tech - nique or referral to a physician, based on simple decision making algorithms (Figure 2). Initiatives such as MACVIA-LR (Contre les Maladies Chroniques pour un Vieillissement Actif en Languedoc-Roussillon; Fighting Chronic Diseases for Active and Healthy Ageing)-ARIA (Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asth- ma) in the pharmacy will help pharmacists to implement good practices contributing to a com- munity-based integrated care of patients with AR.Joao A.

They both affect children's quality of life, cognitive function, learning ability and the decision making process, thus resulting in signif- icant impairment of the school performance (presenteeism). Un- der-diagnosed or untreated AR of- ten exacerbates comorbid asthma and also causes school absentee - ism or presenteeism. Children spend most of their time in schools. Indoor and outdoor air quality is important, especially in children with vulnerable airways. Exposure to indoor allergens, such as house-dust mite, cat, dog, cock- roach, fungi and mould can trigger symptoms in sensitized children with AR. Exposure to various in- door pollutants at schools, such as volatile organic compounds (VOC), depending on the use of marker boards, to cleansing or dis - infecting chemicals for the class- room cleaning, and to particulate matter (PM) from chalk and dust may deteriorate airway disease. Additionally, poor indoor ventila- tion with exposure to high levels of CO2 can reduce concentration ability of children.THE ROLE OF SCHOOLS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC UPPER AIRWAY DISEASE 11 KEY MESSAGES The EAACI/GA2LEN Task Force has recently developed recom - mendations for the management of the allergic child at school (Ta -ble 1). A comprehensive approach focused on the child with AR and its comorbidities can provide a comfortable school life (Figure 1). Zeynep Tamay Istanbul University Medical Faculty Turkey TABLE 1 Action points (EAACI/GA2LEN Task Force) Students should be able to take reliever medication for allergic rhinitis (AR) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) at school, as required Students should not be criticized for frequently displaying symptoms of AR or CRS Teachers should be aware of increased symptoms of AR or CRS during outdoor exercise activities in peak seasons Schools should aim to reduce indoor air pollutant sources including allergens, and improve indoor ventilation Teachers should be aware of and take into consideration the negative effect of AR or of CRS on examination performance.395GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION I - Global strategy for the management of allergic rhinitis and chronic rhinosinusitisThe head teacher, responsible for school policy, should aim to create an allergy friendly school. Regu- lar education programs about AR and its comorbidities should be arranged to improve knowledge level and attitude of the school staff. Newly admitted students with chronic upper airway disease and comorbid diseases should be identified and recorded during the school registration process. The status of the illness should be checked at the annual re-registra- tions. Students with chronic upper airway disease are encouraged to have their medications readily available and safely stored at all times. Additionally, relieving med- ication must be always available in the school. Schools should aim to reduce indoor air pollutant sourc - es including allergens, improve indoor ventilation, and maintain healthy indoor and outdoor air quality.KEY REFERENCES 1.

The ISAAC study evi- denced that over 30% of paedi- atric population present current symptoms of AR, while almost 20% suffer from current rhi- no-conjunctivitis, the most indic- ative epidemiological tool for up- per airway atopic condition. The remarkable prevalence of AR in certain Latin American countries positions them among the highest incidence worldwide (Table 1). There was no significant correla- tion between markers of country development such as gross na - tional product (GNP), infant mor- tality rate or environmental pol - lution, and the prevalence of AR symptoms. However, conditions like environmental tobacco smoke or active smoking could have a detrimental impact in this popula - tion (Figure 1). There is an intriguing report of nasal allergies prevalence below 10% corresponding to 8 Latin American countries, based on telephone interviews asking for AR diagnosis. This wide difference could be attributed to methodol- ogy or to under-diagnosis. One of MANAGING ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINO-SINUSITIS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES - FOCUS ON LATIN AMERICA 12a KEY MESSAGES the most common co-morbidity of AR is sinusitis, but no data is avail- able for prevalence of chronic rhi - no-sinusitis in Latin America. A survey of 20 physicians and 200 patients from Argentina on the management of AR, showed that more than half of patients had moderate to severe AR, and two out of three had sinusitis, with a similar proportion having a sig- nificant impact on the quality of life. Preferred treatment both for patients and physicians (60% of respondents) were oral anti-his- tamines and nasal steroids, in accordance with first treatment options suggested by guidelines. Nonetheless, 40% of patients re- ceived an inappropriate AR man - agement. Scarce availability and poor affordability of essential drugs like nasal corticosteroids in Latin American countries could also explain the elevated preva - lence and severity of AR. Accord- ing to current reports 81 million of children live in poverty in Latin America and appropriate access to a correct evaluation and treat- ment is not guaranteed at all. Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) initiative is one of the engines promoting the knowl- edge and management of AR in Latin America, in order to achieve the necessary changes in health policies that finally benefit this huge population affected.

In the East-European coun- tries (EECs) data on prevalence of AR is rather sparse in comparison to Western Europe, reflecting the lower level of funding for epide - miological projects. In addition, a huge number of subjects, mainly with intermittent and/or mild AR don`t reach the doctor's offices. Data from classical epidemiolog - ical studies on AR prevalence in EECs derive from studies in the 1950-1990s period. In the Rus- sian Federation and the CIS coun- tries prevalence studies were per - formed using ISAAC approach and revealed a prevalence for AR rang - ing from 1.4 to 39.7% in different countries (Table 1). Higher preva- lence of AR was associated with intense urbanization and industri- alization. The survey showed that 1.3-52 % of young children suffer from AR, while the prevalence in older children was 20-26%. For the Russian Federation the preva- lence of AR of 13-39% was found in children and adults depending on climate, geographic and eco - logic features of the region. In the last 20 years, the prevalence of MANAGING ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES - FOCUS ON EASTERN EUROPE 12b KEY MESSAGES AR in the Russian Federation in- creased 4-6 times, peaking at the age of 18-24. The incidence of AR in Ukraine was 22% and of CRS of 20-40%. The urban population was more frequently affected with 20% of nearly 8 million people compared to the rural population where 14% presented with AR. In Belarus, the AR prevalence was nearly 4%, with children more fre- quently affected (5.6%). In Poland, almost 25% of adult population was affected by AR and 16% by CRS. A study on 933 patients in Hungary found that 52.5% of pa- tients suffered from seasonal AR and 35.1% from perennial AR. In Bulgaria the prevalence of AR was found to be 16%, more than half associated with pollen sensitiza- tion. The main risk factors for the de - velopment of AR in EECs depicted by the surveys were family histo -ry of atopy, sensitization to aller- gens, smoking, air pollution and climate factors. In Russia, Belarus, Poland, Bulgaria and most other EECs networks of specialized al - lergy centers for diagnostics and treatment of AR are set in place or under development. A deficiency in the EECs is the insufficient use of educational programs for AR and CRS. The main disease-mod- ifying treatment of AR is allergen immunotherapy.

The dense population is further compounded by rapid economic development, urbani - zation and the subsequent envi- ronmental pollution. The true in- cidence and prevalence of AR and CRS in the Asia Pacific is difficult to determine given the vast region with different socio economic and health care systems. The Allergies in Asia-Pacific Sur- vey, which was published in 2011 reported an overall prevalence of 8.7% for the physician-diagnosed nasal allergy in eight countries in the region after screening of 33378 households, with 1043 adults and 192 children includ- ed in the survey. The prevalence varied from that reported for the developed countries to the devel - oping countries, underlying the diversity in Asia Pacific. The prev- alence ranged from 13.2 % in Aus- tralia, to 9.1% in China, 9.6% in Taiwan, 7.1% in Malaysia to 12.3 % in Vietnam and 2.5% in Philip- pines. AR affected both adults and children, and the average age at MANAGING ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES - FOCUS ON ASIA PACIFIC 12c KEY MESSAGES diagnosis was 26 years for adults and 9 years for children. The geography of Asia Pacific, with the majority of the countries having a tropical and subtropi - cal climate, influence the type of predominant AR, with 66% of pa- tients having intermittent or sea- sonal AR (SAR), and only 30% re- porting persistent or perennial AR (PAR) (Figure 1). The majority of the patients were treated by general practition - ers (40%) and by ENT physicians (40%), with only 2-3% managed by allergists or respiratory physi - cians. Investigation of allergy was not routinely performed, with 42% having had no allergy investigation at all. When allergy testing was done 9% were skin prick tested only, 14% blood tested only and 17% had both tests performed. BURDEN OF DISEASE AND IMPACT ON QUALITY OF LIFE The burden of AR and CRS is well documented and is increasing in Asia Pacific with significant impact on quality of life (QoL), notably by interference with work and school performance, productivity, daily life, and sleep (Figure 2). Reports show that AR significantly trou- bles 96% of adults and of children. The most bothersome symptoms included nasal congestion (78%), Narayanan Prepageran University Malaya Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia401GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION I - Global strategy for the management of allergic rhinitis and chronic rhinosinusitis rhinorrhea (74%) and sneezing (71%). Only 41% of adults and 47% of children felt their symp- toms were controlled, thus it is of no surprise that work productivity decreased from 88% to 63% when the patient had AR (Figure 3). The impact of AR on the quality of sleep is well recognized with over 70% of the adults and 60% children indicating sleep related disturbances (Figure 4). Up to 41% of children find their nasal allergy interfering or pre - venting them from attending school, with reduction of school performance from 86% to 66%. Nearly 85% of children reported a significant impact of allergies on their day-to-day life. Given the huge population poten- tially affected by AR and CRS in Asia Pacific it might be speculated that the lost productivity and the economic consequences may be significantly higher compared to other regions. TREATMENT PARADIGM, UNMET NEEDS AND PATIENTS PERSPECTIVE The treatment of AR and CRS is well established by guidelines. Despite this, reports reveal that patients in this region are not achieving adequate control of their symptoms with up to 58% of adult patients claiming that their allergies are not optimally controlled despite medication. Although up to 67% of patients were on some form of treatment for their symptoms. The usage of intranasal corticosteroids (INS) was surprisingly very low (19- 20%), despite guidelines clearly Figure 1 Intermittent or perennial allergies in Asia Pacific. Figure 2 Interference with work due to allergic diseases. Managing allergic rhinitis and chronic rhinosinusitis in developing countries - focus on Asia Pacific402GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION I - Global strategy for the management of allergic rhinitis and chronic rhinosinusitis suggesting their usage as the gold standard for moderate to severe AR. Thus, the unsatisfactory lev- el of disease control, may be due to the lower usage of INS as the primary treatment of choice. Even among the patients on INS, only 27% were very satisfied with their steroid nasal spray. Reasons for dissatisfaction included low effi- cacy (72%) and lack of 24-hour re- lief (15%) (Figure 5). Some patients were compliant to the prescribed INS due to their concerns about side effects, long-term use, or due to loss of efficacy over time.Contrary to popular perception that cost would be an issue in Asia Pacific, cost was not reported as a major factor among uncontrolled patients. Low patient education and awareness appears to be equally important, as only 20% of patients claim to have some infor -Figure 3 Reduction of work productivity due to allergic rhinitis.

It is also interesting to note that up to 40% of patients visit and get advice on allergy from their pharmacist, thus education on AR management should be provided to all health care profes - sionals (HCP) and not restricted to medical doctors alone. FUTURE DIRECTION AND CHALLENGES The prevalence of AR and CRS in Asia Pacific will continue to rise drastically in tandem with the ex - ponential economic growth and ur - banization in this region. Increased risk factors for atopy associated with congested modern urban liv - ing, predominant in major Asian cities, in parallel with increased en - vironmental pollution will increase the total burden of allergic diseas - es on the already precarious health care systems in this region. Asia Pacific is unique in the fact that it contains a highly diverse popula - tion, with marked variation in the genetic background as well in the living environments.There may be a need to tailor the existing guidelines according to the different needs and challeng- es in this region. A recent study on the acceptance of the ARIA guidelines, that is widely used by the HCP in Malaysia, revealed that although the majority com- plied with the guideline, up to 34% of ENTs, 42% of pharmacists and 11% of general practitioners felt that there was a need to tailor the guidelines to suit the regional problems and allergens. CONCLUSION Both AR and CRS have significant impact on the heath care systems in Asia Pacific, with a similar dis- ease burden as for the rest of the world and with up to 90% of patients reporting an impact on quality of life. The rapid economic growth with corresponding pollu - tion and urbanization will increase the prevalence of allergic disor - ders, with increasing socio-eco- nomic impact in the future. There is an urgent need to ac - knowledge the significant the im- pact of these disorders on societal costs and the differences in the treatment paradigm, challenges and unmet needs for the different areas in the region. Poor patient and HCP education has a signifi- cant negative impact. Guidelines on treatment of allergic diseases need to be adapted according to the local needs and challenges. KEY REFERENCES 1.

These chronic diseas- es confer a significant burden through direct or indirect symp - toms, complications and cost. In contrast to developed coun - tries, the government health pro - gram of many African countries focus only on transmissible dis - eases, malnutrition, maternal and infant mortality, while data on res - piratory diseases remain scarce. The prevalence of AR is very high (>35%) among Nigerian Africans, and it is likely that environmental factors are responsible for major differences with other countries. AR prevalence is much higher in urban area, especially in capital cities from Africa. CRS is not less common. The advent of HIV-AIDS has further worsened the inci - dence of CRS in Africa. Local allergens related to African environmental settings are not well known. House dust mites and cockroaches are reported as ma - jor allergens in Africa, while pollen allergens remain poorly described.

Table 1 shows an overview of AR and re - lated diseases in Africa. Both AR and CRS significantly af- fect the quality of life of Africans through direct cost (payments to doctors for frequent consul - tations, prescribed medications, over the counter (OTC) drugs, alternative and complementary drugs), indirect costs (loss of work hours and school days) and intan - gible costs (loss of quality of life, pain and suffering, psychologi- cal maladjustment, social costs). These costs become significant in countries with high prevalence of allergy and low per capital income, as seen both in the Anglophone and Francophone African coun- tries.Abiodun D.

These include the genetic background, cigarette smoke, chemicals, cold tempera - tures, humidity, wind, pollution, hairspray, wood smoke and fumes. A comparison of risk factors for AR from two studies from Africa is shown in Table 2. Added to these known risk factors are poverty, poor education on how to avoid risk factors and poor health infra - structures, which are known to be prevalent in Africa, and which further increase the burden of the disease. PECULIARITIES OF AR AND CRS AMONG AFRICANS Urban migration of rural workers is increasing pollution in urban ar- eas, and further amplifies the in- cidence of AR and CRS. The lack of information on allergic diseas- es in Africa can be explained by the shortness in physicians and other personnel trained in allergy diagnosis and management. Due to financial constraints, AR and CRS patients are primarily seen by nurses or by the general prac - titioners; the education of GPs in some African countries is highly limited regarding ear, nose and throat diseases in general, and AR and CRS in particular. The diagnosis of AR in Afri - ca is largely clinical, due to the non-availability of allergy tests in most countries. Allergen-specific serum IgE is measured in a very limited number of private labora - tories, and thus is unaffordable to most patients. Screening for AR using total serum IgE can be de - ceptive in Africans since helmin- thic infections, rather than genet- ic factors, may be responsible for the increase in the total serum IgE levels. Because of contending socioeco - nomic challenges, most patients are often unaware of their AR and CRS. Coupled with out-of-pocket payment for healthcare cost, pres - entation to the hospital is often delayed, and it is not uncommon for complications to be present at diagnosis (Figure 1). Overall the management of AR and CRS in many African countries is poorly developed and the quality of care offered is often at a low standard. Only some countries have imple- mented evidence-based guideline recommendations. Treatment of AR follows the ARIA guidelines in most tertiary care centers.In most African countries, pharma - ceutical practices are unregulated, resulting in unfettered access to OTC drugs and other regulated drugs, with management of AR and CRS not based on sound ev - idence. Treatment is based on the availability of essential drugs and their financial affordability. For example, chlorpheniramine and beclomethasone are part of the WHO essential drugs list and diseases are available and subsi - dized, while, antileukotrienes and anti-IgE are not used in many low income countries. Antibiotic treat- ment such as amoxicillin-clavu- lanate is frequently used for CRS compared to others antibiotic classes due to its availability in deprived countries. Finally endo- scopic sinus surgery is expensive and needs a specific training. Al- lergen-specific immunotherapy is not easily accessible because of lack of trained specialists and un - known regional allergens. Depending on cultural and social barriers patients seek self-treat- ment and unproven traditional therapies. There is widespread use of alternative and complementary therapy, largely because they are cheaper, and also because of local beliefs.TABLE 2 Risk factors for allergic rhinitis identified by two African studies Desalu et al, (2009) Olusesi, Amodu & Said, (2007) * Dust (55.8%) Dust (65%) Kitchen Fumes (20.7%) Smoke (60%) Cold Weather (10.6%) Perfumes (49%) Smoke (5.1%) Weather (27%) Fuel (gasoline) (4.6%) Red Wine (22%) *Multiple allergy trigger reported by many patients Management of allergic rhinitis and chronic rhinosinusitis in developing countries - focus on Africa407GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION I - Global strategy for the management of allergic rhinitis and chronic rhinosinusitis KEY REFERENCES 1.

These terms are even used when there is no evidence of allergy, as the cause of any rhi - nitis symptoms, hence they are over-reported. On the same note, the term \"rhinosinusitis\" is newer and thus less diagnosed. Specific allergy diagnostic facilities are scanty in the South Asia region, hence the diagnosis of allergic rhi - nitis (AR) is more often a clinically empirical diagnosis. In India, AR is rarely given the importance it de - serves and is considered to be a trivial disease, despite the fact that symptoms of rhinitis have been noted to be present in 75% of chil - dren and 80% of asthmatic adults and despite it's profound impact on the quality of life.

Studies in India have shown that 63-89% of adults with AR and 65% of children have underlying chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and nasal polyps (NP). Even when the presence of NP and CRS in AR is sought for, inadequate treat - ments, both medical and surgical, along with troublesome adverse effects of the medications add to the problem. Although topical corticosteroids are now increasingly being rec -ognized as the cornerstone of the treatment for AR, in most of the South Asian countries, anti-his- tamines still form the first line of treatment. Both first and second generation anti-histamines are commonly used. The choice of treatment is limited by several factors. Cost is a major factor, and includes the cost of the drug itself and the doctor's fee plus the logistical costs of access- ing healthcare (for example travel expense), as well as the possible adverse effects. Hence, many patients prefer to visit alternate medicine practitioners, for relief of their ailments.KEY REFERENCES 1. Yusuf OM.

The potentiating effect of the consid- erable increases in air pollutant levels on the rising prevalence of the respiratory disorders cannot be ignored (Figure 2).

In China, dust mites and Artemisia pollen (Figure 3) have been reported as the most common perennial and seasonal cause of AR. While the mucosal inflammatory processes in Caucasian subjects with CRS are mainly orchestrated by Th2 cytokines and are char - acterized by an increased tissue eosinophilia and local IgE produc - tion, the predominant endotype in Asian subjects with CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is char-acterized as a Th17 cell-mediat- ed predominance of neutrophils. However, it has been demonstrat - ed that there is a shift over time from the predominantly neutro - philic to an eosinophilic response in Asian CRSwNPs patients.

These conditions impair patients' quality of life (QoL), cause sleep disturbance and, through loss of work and school attendance, are responsible for an enormous lost in productivity annually. Thus, the indirect costs of both these dis - eases are substantial. Direct costs are also high, mostly from medica - tion use, but are often underesti- mated because many products to allegedly treat these diseases are sold over-the-counter. The gener- al belief that nasal symptoms are \"normal\" leads patients to avoid seeing a doctor and to buy over- the-counter products; however, there may be more cost-effective ways of treating these conditions in the long-term. There are two main strategies for etiological treatment of AR and CRS: allergen avoidance and al - lergen immunotherapy (AIT). Both approaches are disease-modifying and require the identification of the allergen causing the symp - toms, either by skin prick test or serum specific IgE detection.

Studies in which allergic patients were moved to an allergen-free environment, such as a high-al- titude village or a hospital room, were indeed successful. Allergen avoidance involves different meas- ures depending on the allergen in question, but general measures can be beneficial to control expo- sure to a range of indoor allergens (Figure 1). Examples include min- imizing allergen reservoirs, such as carpets and sofas, keeping the home dry, maintaining good ven - tilation, regular cleaning of surfac- es, room air filters and masks. Use of acaricides and extensive bed - room-based environmental con- trol measures may provide some benefit in reducing symptoms in house dust mite perennial AR. Na- sal irrigation may be useful as an adjunctive treatment of AR during unavoidable exposure to airborne allergens and pollutants. To achieve successful allergen avoidance patients' education to follow the recommended meas - ures is essential, which can be complemented with written in- structions, visual aids and home visits, where practical advice can be provided and demonstrated. However, allergen avoidance and its costs should be balanced with 413GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION I - Global strategy for the management of allergic rhinitis and chronic rhinosinusitis Figure 1 Allergen avoidance in allergic rhinitis.

Patients sensitized to indoor allergens who have identified allergens that correlate with their rhino-conjunctivitis symptoms may benefit from environmental control measures (eg, removal of pets, the use of air filtration systems, bed covers and acaricides). B. Outdoor allergens (lower row): tree and/or grass pollens: during plant pollination seasons exposure to the small airborne pollen particles is practically unavoidable on outdoor activities; nevertheless, identifying the clinically relevant sensitizing pollens and following their pollination calendars (https:/ /www.polleninfo.org/en/ laenderauswahl.html) may help rhinitis patients to better plan outdoor activities and their preventive and symptomatic medication during peak pollen exposure days. the burden of the disease. Allergen immunotherapy can modify the immune response to allergens (Figure 2) and is es- pecially indicated in moderate/ severe rhinitis uncontrolled by allergen avoidance and adequate evidence-based pharmacologic treatment. In summary, allergen avoidance measures and allergen immuno - therapy are probably the best two \"buys\" for prevention and control of allergic rhinitis/rhinosinusitis as they target the underlying cause of the allergic inflammation.KEY REFERENCES 1.

When, however the relation between exposure and symptoms is not so clear, allergy may, or may not be relevant since exposure to irritants, infection, anatomic factors, drug and medication abuse etc. may mimic allergy. Thus, to diagnose and treat upper respiratory and ocular allergy, not only allergy tests but also knowledge and experi - ence of a specialist are required. The diagnosis of allergic diseases is based on a very careful medi - cal history, physical examination and skin and laboratory tests, us - ing standardized commercial or sometimes native allergen prepa- rations, both for skin testing and provocation. Proof of sensitisa- tion (positive skin test or specific IgE) is in principle a prerequisite for the diagnosis of AR, but these tests may also fail to identify aller- gy or to implicate the allergen as the main cause of patients' symp- toms. When proof of sensitisation is absent while the medical histo - ry is characteristic of allergy or is discordant with the clinical history provocation tests may be helpful.THE ROLE OF THE ALLERGIST IN ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS 14 KEY MESSAGES The allergist has access to a spe - cialist laboratory, where sensiti- sation, cross reactivity between allergens and allergen exposure can be investigated. The recent in- troduction of component resolved diagnosis offers new opportu- nities for improved accuracy in laboratory testing. The modern al- lergist is qualified to recommend, perform and interpret the results of such diagnostic tests. The allergist has an unique arsenal of therapeutic measures, be it pre- ventive advice, drug treatment, allergen immunotherapy (AIT) or application of biologicals. Patients should be informed accurately about how medication should be used (as needed or prophylactic) and the benefits and side effects that can be expected from each type of medication. AIT has been shown to be remarkably effective in patients with rhino-conjunctivi- tis to pollens, mites, dander and/ or moulds. AIT, although very safe when administered properly can also provoke severe allergic re - actions. For all of these reasons, it requires a specialised setting and good knowledge about in - dication and contraindications. With respect to injection AIT, the treatment should be performed by qualified medical personnel under direct supervision of the special - ist. Sublingual AIT starts in the allergy practice and continues at home. There are significant differences in the way AR is managed in primary Jan G. de Monchy University of Groningen NetherlandsJacques RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION I - Global strategy for the management of allergic rhinitis and chronic rhinosinusitiscare compared to an allergist set - ting (Figure 1). On the other hand AR is so prevalent that allergists neither could nor should see all patients. Only specific patients should be referred to the allergist. These patients may require lung function and or allergen provoca - tion testing and further tests aimed at food, drug or occupational aller - gy. Very often these patients can be referred back with therapeutic advice after consultation. Allergists have the responsibility to ensure the best management for the allergic patients catered for in their region. This implies that allergists should help to cre - ate a local network, where general practitioners, paediatricians, ENT specialists and Allergists collabo - rate in providing optimal and cost effective patient care. The optimal setting for such a network is the Allergy Centre. Notably when the atopic patient is suffering from several allergic diseases such as eczema, asthma, food allergy next to AR referral to an allergy centre is rational and cost effective. Next to other specialists, Aller- gists play their role within this framework, notably by testing counselling and treating patients with complex multi-organ aller- gies. The Allergy Centre offers to private allergists, GPs and other medical specialists more exten - sive diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities. The Allergy Centre can also offer care and education through nurses, dieticians and other health care workers. The op- timal location for an Allergy Cen-tre is in a university hospital or a large regional hospital, where all relevant specialties are adequate- ly represented. In addition, most health care sys- tems consider continuing medical education a potential tool to im- prove quality of care and reduce disease management costs. The effectiveness of a one-year con- tinuing medical education/con- tinuing professional development course for general practitioners, regarding the improvement in knowledge of ARIA and GINA guidelines and compliance with them in asthma management was proven recently.

The knowledge of Google trends offers data regarding the epidemiology of rhinitis. Google searches of the term allergic rhi - nitis (AR) have a clear seasonal- ity, with peaks during spring and late summer, and with patterns that differ between the North and South hemisphere (Figure 1). They closely correlate with searches on pollen counts, and informa - tion about antihistamines, as well as with records of antihistamine sales, and thus reflect the suffer- ing caused by the disease in real time. They have a potential use to predict and monitor outbreaks of AR, similar to other diseases such as influenza. As part of the epidemiologic re - search, online surveys are current - ly easy to prepare and require a limited time to upload the survey, while responses are collected di - rectly in a database-format ready to be analysed without further management. Another great ad- vantage of online surveys is that they can reach a huge number of potential participants. Survey Monkey and Google drive are two extensively used examples of such WEB-BASED SURVEYS AND MONITORING IN THE MANAGEMENT OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS 15 KEY MESSAGES online survey tools. Surveys can be dedicated to specific diseases, or can render information as part of more general approaches to health conditions. Online surveys addressing topics on rhinitis or chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) have been able to identify associations of AR with sleep time and duration as well as with depression and su - icidal ideation. They furthermore provide data to compare the qual - ity of life between patients with AR and those with CRS, to check the impact of rhinitis symptoms according to their type or time of onset and to identify unmet treat- ment needs. There are, however, limitations in the usefulness of online-collected information, as younger patients (Figure 2) and those with more severe symp - toms might be more likely to use the web to receive information or advice and to participate in online surveys. Nonetheless, concerns about the reliability and compara - bility of answers are usually pres - ent in relation to more traditional sources of information too. The Internet also offers interac- tive questionnaires in several lan- guages for the patients to assess their rhinitis severity and control according to e.g. the ARIA classi- fication (Figure 3).

The prevalence of allergic rhinitis (AR) has steadily increased over the past decades, affecting up to 30% of children and adults in Europe. A large-scale European survey has demonstrated chronic rhinosinus - itis (CRS) is affecting 11% of the total European population. The socio-economic impact of chronic upper airway inflammation cannot be underestimated. Direct and in - direct costs of chronic rhinitis and rhinosinusitis sum up to more than 150 billion Euros per year in Europe. In addition, up to 20% of patients treated for AR and CRS remain un - controlled, even despite surgery for CRS. Given the fact that AR is a ma - jor risk factor for the development of asthma, action should be under - taken to prevent asthma. UNMET NEEDS Unmet needs in the field of AR and CRS can arbitrarily be split into four different domains: edu- cation, research, development and clinical care.

Hellings Secretary General - European Academy of Allergy and Clinical ImmunologyCezmi A. Akdis Past-President - European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology421GLOBAL ATLAS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITISSECTION I - Global strategy for the management of allergic rhinitis and chronic rhinosinusitisGiven the lack of insight into fac - tors driving uncontrolled upper air - way disease, research should focus on determinants of uncontrolled AR and CRS, including severe chronic airway disease (SCUAD). Better insight into the exogenous and endogenous factors being re - sponsible for uncontrolled disease will allow the design of optimal treatment strategies. The development of novel tools for evaluation of subjective bur - den of the disease by the patients are needed, like user-friendly and cheap devices for the measure - ment of nasal patency, hyperre - activity and inflammation, smell dysfunction and control of disease. The daily follow-up of symptom control and other parameters of the disease need to be implement - ed in routine care, as this will help both the patients and physicians to design optimal personalized care. Current clinical care pathways should be optimized and personal- ized for obtaining a higher degree of control for both AR as well as CRS. In AR, an action plan is need- ed to improve endotyping, predict the success of different medical treatment options, and prevent the development of asthma. In CRS, the choice of prolonged med - ical treatment or surgery needs to be based on the prediction of success of both approaches and the patients' preference in this regard. In CRS without nasal pol- yps (CRSsNP), personalized care is warranted with improvement of insight into the different factors of the pathophysiology and better drug delivery at the site of inflam- mation. In CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), novel biologicals are emerging as effective treatment options for those patients not re- sponding well to current medical or surgical treatment. The precise positioning of biologicals into ex- isting care pathways for CRS re- mains the challenge, as they may represent an alternative for sur- gery. Given the persistence of in- flammation after surgery (FESS) in the majority of patients, post-op- erative prolonged care and fol- low-up is mandatory. A WORLDWIDE STRATEGY TO REDUCE THE BURDEN OF CHRONIC UPPER AIRWAY DISEASE In view of the high need to opti - mize patient care in the epidemic of chronic upper airway diseases, a worldwide strategy to reduce the burden of chronic upper airway dis - ease is warranted. This action plan can only be successful by the com - bined actions of all the stakehold - ers: physicians and other health - care professionals such as allied health and pharmacists, research - ers, patient organizations, industry and policy makers. Therefore, join - ing forces by all stakeholders in a unique platform will be necessary to reach the goal (Figure 1). Research and development should be synergized and prioritized in or - der to achieve sustainable results on prevention, biomarkers, cura - tive treatment, anti-viral vaccines, and novel drug development. There are a number of barriers and obstacles in grant giving bodies to be solved, particularly to support human immunology and allergy re - search (Table 1). A WORLDWIDE STRATEGY TO FIGHT AND MANAGE ALLERGIC DISEASES SHOULD BE DEVELOPED (TABLE 2). All stakeholders including health - care professionals, psychologists, patient organizations, educators, industry, and policy makers should be involved. A multidisciplinary and scientific approach is essen- tial. Modern global guidelines should be developed and imple - mented for the management of AR, CRS and co-morbidities. The new generation guidelines should pro- vide structured, multidisciplinary, region and environment-oriented and individual patient-focused solutions, with full considerations on differences across cultures. A good move forward is the current concept of integrated care path - ways for reaching an optimal ther- apeutic approach in patients with AR (Figure 2). It is now time to act on an integrated care platform for chronic airway disease.

Vision, roadmap and land-marking eventThe European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) is a non-profit organization active in the field of allergic and immunologic diseases such as asthma, rhinitis, eczema, occupational allergy, food and drug allergy and anaphylaxis. Its scope covers both basic science and clinical medicine. Since its establishment in 1956, EAACI has grown to become the largest medical association in Europe in the field of allergy and clinical immunology. Its membership currently includes nearly 7800 members from 121 countries, representing academicians, clinicians, and allied health professionals. In addition, EAACI includes 47 National Allergy Societies as members. EAACI's mission is to provide the most efficient platform for scientific communication and education in the field of allergy and immunology, ultimately striving to ease the lives of patients suffering from these diseases. EAACI is regarded as the primary source of expertise in Europe for all aspects of allergy. EAACI's activities Fostering science through dedicated platforms Annual Congress, Focused Meetings, Guidelines and Position Papers Educating professionals (Allergy Schools; CME system; knowledge examination in allergy and clinical Immunology; Research and Clinical Fellowships) Disseminating knowledge through EAACI Journals (Allergy, Pediatric Allergy Immunology, Clinical and Translational Allergy, EAACI Newletter) and online communication platforms Advocating change and raising awareness among the European Union's decision makers about the importance of allergy and clinical immunology and the opportunities to prevent and treat allergies through Public Campaigns and Public DeclarationsAllergic rhinitis (AR) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) affect more than 30% of the population worldwide and pose a huge burden on healthcare systems through direct and indirect costs. The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology called on all worldwide leaders to develop the \"Global Atlas of Allergic Rhinitis and Chronic Rhinosinusitis\" The EAACI Global Atlas of Allergic Rhinitis and Chronic Rhinosinusitis was written by 218 authors from 38 countries and aims to increase awareness on the global epidemic and the burden of chronic inflammatory upper airways diseases and to warrant their recognition as a main concern in national health strategies. Several priorities can be identified such as the development of novel tools for evaluation of subjective burden of the disease by the patients, improvement of the current clinical care pathways to obtaining a higher degree of control, research focused on determinants of uncontrolled and severe AR and CRS, altogether with a higher level of education of physicians, pharmacists and patients focusing on the benefits of proper diagnosis and adequate personalized treatment. In view of the high need to optimize patient care in the epidemic of chronic upper airway diseases, a worldwide strategy to reduce the burden of chronic upper airway disease is warranted.
