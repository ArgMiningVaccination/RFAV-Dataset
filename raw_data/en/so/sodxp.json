Guest Reviews - SusanVisited November 2018 Amatara is a beautiful, peaceful destination and I would highly recommend it. It was exactly what I was looking for with a big plus of being located in the most beautiful beach. Health and Fitness Travel never fails in suggesting the best destinations for my holidays. Big thank you! - MelVisited January 2018 A perfect combination of fitness, spa treatments and relaxation. Excellent facilities and members of staff. I've returned home feeling like a new person. Thank you Health and Fitness Travel for recommending this holiday and organising it all for me! - D D, Trip Advisor ReviewVisited January 2016 First time back to stay at Amatara since the rebranding previously The Regent Hotel. We have stayed here a number of times before and didn't know exactly what to expect if things had changed. Very happy to say that we had a great stay and the hotel is still a magic place to visit. The GM and Executive Chef are both still the same, we were recognised by some of the staff from our previous stay same with our children. Had an amazing meal at the fine dining ' The Grill' restaurant on the deck overlooking the water amazing spot and fantastic quality food with great technique and flavour. We had a ocean view pool villa again very large comfy space very well maintained with butler service and extra benefits. Altogether a very relaxing enjoyable stay looking forward to returning again in the future. - ryanrf2015, Trip Advisor ReviewVisited January 2016 From the second you arrive to the second you check out and after you are waited on hand and foot. The facilities are an oasis on its own... the pool, grounds and spa. The food and spa are higher for sure than other places in thailand but you get what you pay for. The massages are 10 times better than the ones on the side of the road.Perfect place will definitely be staying several more times. The best part is they have day rooms for free if your flight doesn't leave till late they give you a room to wait in so you can shower and sleep if you like. - ma_begonia, Trip Advisor ReviewVisited January 2016 We stayed in Amatara's Premier Sea view room for 3 nights. The hotel is very well designed and just pleasing to the eye. The lobby is something else! The room was so comfortable and we had a lovely view; the bathtub is just perfect. The hotel's pool area is peaceful and the views are great. We did not use any of the spa services. The best places to eat are the Restaurant and the Grill (make reservations in advance in order to get best tables outside). The room service is fine, but we found it better to leave the room and eat at the hotel restaurants as the in room dining menu is limited. We did not try to the hotel buffet breakfast. We definitely recommend staying here! Just don't do the day trip out to Phi Phi Le.

The private infinity pool is perfect for a post-lunch dip! - Whether you enjoy the traditional flavours of Thailand or prefer to opt for something a little more subtle, the restaurants at Amatara have you covered. Try dining at 'The Grill' - it's won awards! Lows - Whilst the airport to hotel is only 45 minutes, this can sometimes feel like a lifetime after an international flight - even in the back of a private transfer! - Mosquitos love a warm climate. The sea breeze drives most of them away, however if you are bite prone then we recommend stocking up on some repellent. - Only recently rebranded as a luxury wellness hotel, Amatara still welcomes non-wellness guests i.e. they may be drinking alcohol and not eating healthily. This means you may not feel fully immersed within a wellness atmosphere. - The Thai Hammam is a shared facility, although the spa team do aim to schedule these privately.
