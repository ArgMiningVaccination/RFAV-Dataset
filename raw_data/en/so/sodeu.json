Lung Cancer in which cancer cells migrate to other parts of the body through the blood or lymphatic system, invading and destroying other healthy tissues, is known as malignant Lung cancer. The majority of cases of lung cancer are caused by smoking or exposure to smoke, which causes damage to the lining of the lungs.

Non-small-cell lung carcinoma The three main subtypes of Non-small-cell lung carcinoma are adenocarcinoma, squamous-cell carcinoma, and large-cell carcinoma. Nearly 40% of lung cancers are adenocarcinoma, which usually comes from peripheral lung tissue. A subtype of adenocarcinoma, the bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, is more common in female never-smokers, and may have a better long-term survival. Squamous-cell carcinoma causes about 30% of lung cancers. They typically occur close to large airways. Nearly 9% of lung cancers are large-cell carcinoma.
