Yesterday, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) granted preferential recommendation for differentiated [influenza](https://www.contagionlive.com/clinical/influenza) vaccines for adults 65 years and older. This preferential recommendation includes [Sanofi](https://www.contagionlive.com/search?searchTerm=sanofi)'s Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent flu vaccine. Fluzone High-Dose is the only vaccine approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for superior flu protection in adults 65 and older. \"This recommendation affirms that all flu vaccines are not created equal, and that this vulnerable population requires better protection that a standard dose vaccine may not provide,\" Sanofi said in a statement. Earlier this week, Contagion interviewed Christopher Rizzo, MD, Sanofi's senior medical director, on why there is a need for a high-dose flu vaccine for seniors, and what it means Fluzone to receive ACIP's preferential recommendation. Listen to the mini podcast now to hear Dr. Rizzo's insights. As we age, our bodies mount less of an antibody response to vaccination. Rizzo explains that Fluzone High-Dose is a flu vaccine designed specifically for adults 65 years and older, to ensure they generate adequate antibodies. This is vital, as seniors are prone to severe influenza disease outcomes, such as pneumonia, serious heart conditions, hospitalization, and death. Fluzone High-Dose has an antigen content 4 times higher than standard flu vaccines. It was proven superior to standard dose in a randomized clinical trial, with Fluzone High-Dose reducing the risk of influenza by 24%. \"It is the only influenza vaccine approved in the US that has superiority to standard dose for those over 65,\" Rizzo said.
