Chinese Herbal Medicine has been widely used to improve postpartum recovery and treat uterine subinvolution for thousands of years. Yet, there are many potential laws hidden that are worth exploring. Methods: Prescriptions treating uterine subinvolution were searched and collected to form datasets. Data mining methods including frequency analysis, cluster analysis, and association rule learning were performed to uncover the potent prescription laws of uterine subinvolution treatment. Results: A total of 803 formulae involving 249 herbs were obtained. The top 6 most frequently used herbs of the 249 herbs were being warm in properties, sweet in tastes, and mainly distributed to liver and spleen meridian tropisms. Deficiency-tonifying herbs accounted for the most proportion and heat-clearing herbs ranked the second, followed by blood-activating and stasis-eliminating herbs. 6 clusters were generated by hierarchical clustering, and 5 of them were of clinical significance. 78 rules with support values over 0.25, confidence values over 0.8, and lift values greater than 1 were generated by association rule learning. Conclusion: The basic principles for uterine subinvolution treatment were deficiency-tonifying, heat-clearing, blood-activating, and stasis-eliminating. Herbs with warm properties, sweet tastes, and liver and spleen meridian tropisms are generally suitable. In addition, Sheng-Hua-Tang was the most frequently used formula for the treatment of uterine subinvolution, yet the dialectical prescriptions were diversified with different patterns/symptoms.
