Originating back to Ancient Mayan times, herbal cleansing exercises have been widely used as a form of Curanderismo - the art of Hispanic/Latino traditional medicine. There are many variations and types Curanderismo exercises and ceremonies, one of them being limpias which are energetic and spiritual cleansings. Limpias usually include several elements such as eggs, various herbs, copal incense, water, candles, and mezcal to absorb and cleanse negative energy and vibrations. A highly common facet of these limpias is the egg cleansing ceremony, which serves to cleanse the spirit and discover and remove the Evil Eye (if present). Evil Eye & History In case you are unfamiliar, the evil eye is defined as a malicious glare, usually inspired by jealousy or envy. In Ancient Mayan culture the Evil Eye is particularly dangerous for young children, as they believe that a child's spirit does not incarnate into the body of the baby until they are around 3 years old. Since during this time they are incredibly open, exposed, and vulnerable energetically, the mother usually covers the head of the baby to protect them from the Evil Eye. This is why babies were often adorned with red in Mayan culture as it would draw attention away from the baby instead of their head or eyes. Although the Evil Eye can often be unconscious and not purposefully malicious, just a look from someone emitting negative energy can make a child or an adult's spirit weaker. Egg Cleansing Although most popular in South America, examples of egg cleansing have also been found in Greece, Scotland, Italy, and the Philippines. The details of the ceremony vary from healer to healer (or traditionally Curanderos/as in Spanish) but the basics of the ritual usually remain the same. The Mayan tradition uses the egg cleansing ceremony to release any negative energy or evil eye by allowing it to leave your body and get absorbed by the egg. The ceremony usually includes taking an egg that has been left at room temperature, washing it, setting an intention with the it, and then rubbing in on the body all the way from the head to the toes and back. After the egg has thoroughly absorbed the energy from your body, it is cracked in a glass with water and other ingredients. This is when the Curandero/a can examine the results and depending on the shape and properties of the cracked egg, they can tell you if you have evil eye present, if you have guardians or angels protecting you, if others envy you, if you may have physical health problems, and more. After the healer provides their diagnosis, they can then provide treatments using herbs and candles to remedy the situation. Herbal Remedies Although there is a wide variety of herbal cleansing remedies in Mayan culture, one common herbal remedy to further remove and release any negative energy is rameado or branching (lightly hitting the patient) with ruda/rue herbs. Commonly used for women who are victims of abuse, the ruda plant is said to strengthen self-love and self-confidence and is commonly placed at the entrance of people's homes or used in teas or baths. Another herbal remedy used to absorb any trapped fear in the body is the epazote herb. This ceremony is also centered around restoring the tonal (a person's vital energy/essence). The Mayans believe that as negative or traumatic life experiences occur part of your tonal releases from your body - this ritual serves to call it back. Although there are many ways to do this ceremony is it commonly practiced by branching the herb on the body along with mezcal to cleanse.
