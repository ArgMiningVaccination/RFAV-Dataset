Fiscally Sustainable: Housing is designed to balance the capital and operational costs to ensure continued fiscal viability of the Alberta housing system. Functional: Housing is modestly designed to meet the determined needs of tenants. Environmentally Sustainable: Housing is created that is energy efficient, resilient, healthy and designed for its full life-cycle. Integrated: The design of housing is integrated and integrates with communities, education, health, and community-based supports. Adaptive: Housing is created to be flexible and responsive to meet changing housing needs and the needs of Albertans. Consistent: Housing is consistent across the Province.INTRODUCTION OF GUIDELINES The Alberta Social Housing Corporation (ASHC) Design and Technical Guidelines is an important instrument in delivering well-designed and suitable affordable housing options to Albertans in need. This document serves the Province in its significant long-term investment and active management of its capital housing investment priorities. Under the Alberta Housing Act the Province is responsible \"to enable the efficient provision of a basic level of housing accommodation for persons who because of financial, social or other circumstances require assistance to obtain or maintain housing accommodation\" (S.2 - 1994 cA-30.1). The ASHC Design and Technical Guidelines comply and assist with completing this important commitment. Additionally, for all supportive living accommodations noted in this document, the Design Guidelines uphold the spirit and intent of the Supportive Living Accommodation Licensing Act , but do not represent specific requirements of this legislation. As well, the ASHC Design and Technical Guidelines take into consideration The Canada's National Housing Strategy (NHS) ambitions of sustainable housing and communities; specifically in the three main NHS areas of Environmental, Social, and Economic sustainability. Departmentally, the guidelines support: The Alberta Seniors and Housing Capital Planning Framework in its ability to guide the development and delivery of the ministry's Capital Plan of identifying and prioritizing multi-year capital needs, identifying specific projects and approving capital budget targets. The Alberta Social Housing Corporation Capital Asset Management Framework 's comprehensive asset life-cycle based management system of provincially owned or funded capital assets. The ASHC Design and Technical Guidelines are intended as benchmarks, to outline the minimum standards required by the Province when developing provincially funded housing in Alberta. The guidelines is a tool to convey guiding design principles and technical specifications for the construction of affordable housing, and provide direction to Housing Management Bodies, Designers, Project Managers, Developers and Contractors in new construction and major renovation projects.Alberta Social Housing Corporation | Design and Technical Guidelines 9 INTRODUCTIONMAIN HOUSING USERS Alberta Social Housing Corporation provides housing programs for families, seniors, and individuals with social support needs. These Occupants represent diverse abilities and circumstances and their accommodation type varies based on their unique situations. The Occupants for Alberta Social Housing Corporation buildings include: Seniors (ages 65 and up); Families and individuals with low incomes; People with developmental disabilities; People with physical challenges or disabilities; Persons at risk; Individuals with mental illness and/or substance issues; and Other individuals with special housing needs.DESIGN GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT The Design and Technical Guidelines was developed with input from various Ministries, Housing Management Bodies, Associations and Agencies, industry Architects and Engineers, Contractors and Project Managers. The development of this Manual was completed through extensive background research and stakeholder consultation. The background research contributed to the development of the language, structure and needs to be fulfilled by the overall document. Engineering and design workshops were specific to development of the mechanical and electrical systems, outdoor spaces and landscaping, and typical unit design. The stakeholder workshops developed and confirmed the terminology, framework, program, housing accommodation types, matrix, typical functional program spaces, unit design, accessibility, security, sustainability, innovation, and user groups.Alberta Social Housing Corporation | Design and Technical Guidelines INTRODUCTION102 Users of This Document May Include: Housing Management Bodies Architects Engineers Project Managers Developers Contractors Civil Society Organizations The PublicHOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT 1 How This Document Relates to Other Documents: Capital Planning Framework Capital Asset ManagementALBERTA SENIORS AND HOUSING FRAMEWORK Alberta Social Housing Corporation | Design and Technical Guidelines 11 INTRODUCTION Alberta Seniors & Housing Design Guidlines & Technical Standards F & E Matrix 1Alberta Social Housing Corporation - Furniture & Equipment Matrix recommended Items NotesFamily and Community Housing Development and RenewalSeniors' Housing Development and RenewalNew Housing Supply - Affordable and Specialized Housing Single Family ResidenceMulti-Unit ResidenceApartmentSeniors' Independent LivingSeniors' LodgeSeniors' Lodge with Supportive LivingPermanent Supportive Housing General Furniture & Equipment Wall-mounted shelves in Storage Rooms Gas fireplace In common lounge room - - - - - Privacy window curtain/blinds Facility exterior signage - - Facility interior signage - - Corner guard and corner guard rails - - Soap and paper towel dispenser in public washroom- - - - - Handrails - - - - Carbon monoxide detector Vehicle plug-in with programmable timer and thermostat - Gazebo As required - - - - - Building flagpole(s) - - - - - All kitchenette and commercial kitchen fixturesHood fan IC All washroom fixtures General Commercial Kitchen Equipment - - Assisted Bath Room Adjustable showerehead and/or privacy rod and curtains- - - - - Assisted bathtub units including ceiling tracks or floor lifts- - - - - Emergency Response System - - - - - Speaker system and speakers - - - Window coveringsTypically, privacy curtain/draperies are installed in resident unit/bedroom and blinds are installed in public areas Not in Contract (N.I.C.)

This Guideline was developed with input from various Ministries, Housing Management Bodies, and industry Architects, Engineers, and Project Managers. These Guidelines will be reviewed and updated periodically.1SECTION BREAKDOWN This SECTION 1: GENERAL INFORMATION establishes the baseline requirements for the following: 1.1 Construction Types 1.1.1 Construction Types 1.2 Housing Program and Framework 1.2.1 Housing Accommodation Types Introduction 1.2.2 Family and Community Housing Development and Renewal Program 1.2.3 Seniors Housing Development and Renewal Program 1.2.4 New Housing Supply - Affordable and Specialized Housing Program 1.2.5 Mixed Use Models of HousingAlberta Social Housing Corporation | Design and Technical Guidelines SECTION 1: GENERAL INFORMATION181.1.1.1 New Construction New construction allows a housing accommodation type (or mixed-use type) to be built for the specific housing needs of the Occupant demographic group identified. Extension: Is a new building or new floor area addition to an existing building. This guideline applies in full to this category. 1.1.1.2 Renovations/ Redevelopments Renovations, transform existing buildings and infrastructure, rather than constructing a new building. Renovations require assessments of the building infrastructure, finishes and site conditions. Renovating an existing building offers greater sustainability due to a lesser carbon footprint from construction and demolition. Renovation (Major): When more than 40% of the gross floor area is renovated. Renovation (Minor): When less than 40% of the gross floor area is renovated. This includes maintenance upgrades. If more than 40% of the gross floor area is converted than this guideline applied to the affected renovated elements. 1.1.1.3 Conversion Conversion is a type of project where the use of the existing building is changed to a different use for the building. For example, conversion projects for housing are converted from commercial or office buildings. There are sustainable opportunities in conversions, as housing can require less mechanical and electrical systems than other uses. Similar to Renovations, conversions typically require assessments of the building infrastructure and site conditions. For renovations and conversions , this guideline applies to new building area of the specific elements being modified. Example 1: If windows are replaced they should meet the requirements of SECTION 3: TECHNICAL GUIDELINES for windows. Example 2: If suites are upgraded interior only then only interior elements should meet this guideline.NEW CONSTRUCTION / RENOVATIONS & REDEVELOPMENTS / CONVERSION New buildings should be constructed in con - formance to the current Alberta Building Code [The Code], Part 3 - Building Size and Construction Relative to Occupancy. For sin - gle family homes, duplex homes and town - houses, Part 9 - Housing and Small Building should be used. This Guideline applies to: New Construction Renovation or Redevelopment Conversion1.1.1 Construction Types1.1 Construction TypesAlberta Social Housing Corporation | Design and Technical Guidelines 19 SECTION 1: GENERAL INFORMATIONTo support access to housing options for Albertans with low income, Alberta Social Housing Corporation develops affordable housing through either new affordable housing construction, redevelopments, or renovation projects.

The Permanent Supportive Housing accommodation type includes a wide range of on-site social supports that are designed to build independent living and connect people with community-based health care, treatment and employment services. Functions Residents of a Permanent Supportive Housing building have their own private unit with en-suite washroom, as well as varied common and multi-purpose spaces including: communal kitchens, washrooms, lounges, spiritual/cultural spaces, gardens, outdoor space, etc. The building offers integrated social supports and may integrate 24/7 staffing for persons with special needs (mental health, physical disability, chronic homelessness, victims of family violence, etc.). A Permanent Supportive Housing model could include commercial amenities for residents, such as a coffee shop or community enterprise, that is integrated into the neighbourhood as part of community outreach.Key Design Characteristics Includes bachelor and one-bedroom units. Common spaces build community while providing passive monitoring of the building. Buildings conform to current Barrier-Free Design Guidelines. Safe and secure spaces that equip vulnerable residents with a sense of independence and autonomy. Building design fosters a sense of \"home\" for residents. Materials are durable, future-proof, non-toxic, and sustainable. Features \"neighbourhoods\" within buildings to create human scale and encourage community. On-site storage is provided for residents (i.e. bike storage, carts, mobility devices). Alberta Social Housing Corporation | Design and Technical Guidelines SECTION 1: GENERAL INFORMATION30There are two forms of mixed-use model as outlined by Alberta Social Housing Corporation. The first is the combining of one, or more than one, housing accommodation type in a single building. The second, presented in greater detail below, provides the mixed- use model as a typology of building. This type of mixed- use model integrates one, or more than one, housing accommodation type with a mix of one, or more than one, commercial, institutional, civic, office, and/or other building use type. Note that with varying occupancies, the Code may require specific fire separations between units. Utilizing a mixed-use model allows for the following opportunities: Providing operational viability without operational subsidy; Allowing for densification in the building and on the site; Shared site developments; Providing access to amenities for Residents and the surrounding community; Allowing for a tenant mix (social/affordable/low end of market); Commercial spaces (helps generate revenue); Community programming spaces/agency partnerships; and Asset management level of service considerations.1.2.5 Mixed-Use Models of Housing HOUSING ACCOMMODATION TYPEAlberta Social Housing Corporation | Design and Technical Guidelines 31 SECTION 1: GENERAL INFORMATION1.2.5.1 Examples of a Mixed-Use M odel Mixed-Use Model 1: Combining a church with market housing (apartment housing accommodation type) and non-market housing (permanent supportive housing accommodation type) with a daycare and creative use of space for bike storage. Mixed-Use Model 2: Combining commercial (drug store, grocery store and/or bank) with market housing (apartment housing accommodation type) and non-market housing (permanent supportive housing accommodation type) with office, a daycare, and institutional (university or college). CREATING A MIXED-USE MODEL In creating a mixed-use model building, follow the typical project process as outlined in the 'Design Process' Section of this Design Guideline. Note that these mixed-use models have implications on zoning, parking and life safety requirements under various bylaws, codes and standards. 2 2SECTION 2: DESIGN GUIDELINES SECTION BREAKDOWN This SECTION 2: DESIGN GUIDELINES of the Alberta Social Housing Corporation Design and Technical Guidelines provides direction for the following Design Principles: 2.1 Design 2.1.1 Environmental Sustainability 2.1.2 Site Design 2.1.3 Building Design 2.2 Functional Program 2.2.1 Functional Program Matrix 2.2.2 Occupant Unit Spaces 2.2.3 Building Spaces 2.3 Accessibility 2.3.1 Housing Accommodation Types and Accessibility 2.3.2 Accessible Site and Buildings Alberta Social Housing Corporation | Design and Technical Guidelines SECTION 2: DESIGN GUIDELINES342.1.1.1 Environmental Sustainability Design and construction that is environmentally sustainable, operationally viable, is essential and requires a high level of building systems integration and design foresight. Alberta Social Housing Corporation encourages each project to review whether a green building certification, such as LEED\u00ae, Green Globes or BOMA Best certification, is appropriate. The Seniors and Housing Design Guidelines and Technical Reference Manual addresses three major components of Environmental Sustainability throughout the body of the document. These components are: CLIMATE CHANGE: increase in annual temperature rise due to increases in greenhouse gases caused by energy generation through burning fossil fuels MASS TOXICITY: increase in toxic materials and heavy metals in the environment and food chain resulting from industrial, domestic, agricultural, medical and technological developments MATERIAL RESOURCE DEPLETION: reduction of material resources faster than they are replaceable; over-use of renewable resources causing detrimental ecological impacts To directly work towards achieving these goals, the following targets should be used on new construction projects: Energy Targets: 2020-2022 = 10% energy reduction from National Energy Code of Canada for Buildings 2019 (NECB) 2023-2025 = 20% energy reduction from NECB 2019 2025-2030 = 30% energy reduction from NEBC 2019 Provide rough-ins for future photovoltaic panel connections and include space in the electrical room for future inverters. A building energy model conforming to NECB should be used. Water Use Reduction: Projects with landscaping should be provided without an irrigation system. Rainwater harvesting systems are suggested for site irrigation.Local Materials and Products: Where possible, source materials and products that are local to the project and that will continue to be available locally. This increases serviceability in operations and maintenance and reduces CO2 from transporting materials. Biophilic Design: Intentionally design parts of the building, or the whole, to incorporate natural systems. The practice of biophilic design increases occupant comfort, health and suitability for the environment. Health: Interior materials are to be selected that promote a healthy indoor environment. Materials should not include chemicals listed on the \"Red List\" published by International Living Future Institute. Sustainable Resiliency: Buildings are created to withstand the 'test of time'. Selection of all building systems and materials should be to meet the designed life- expectancy or replacement schedule of the building. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA): Assess the performance of a building over its full life cycle (also known as cradle- to-grave or cradle-to-cradle analysis). Include operations, maintenance and replacement in the LCA review. Construction Waste: 75% of construction and demolition waste should be diverted from the landfill. 2.1.1.2 Low-Energy Passive Design Passive design should be considered in creating building systems that use less energy. Building design should consider: Building orientation to maximize solar heat gain during winter. Additional insulation to reduce the base load for heating and cooling. Optimize window area and performance to allow for natural light, while increasing thermal resistivity.ENVIRONMENTAL2.1 Design 2.1.1 Environmental Design Alberta Social Housing Corporation | Design and Technical Guidelines 35 SECTION 2: DESIGN GUIDELINES Operable windows provided for resident comfort control to reduce the need for cooling; windows should be located such that air flow is activated through the unit or common area. Solar shading provided for windows to reduce heat gain during summer; recommended strategies are extended soffits or overhangs, while deciduous trees can also be used to shade windows during summer and allow partial solar heat gain during the winter. 2.1.1.3 Active, On-site Energy Generation The intent of implementing active design strategies is to provide additional systems that reduce the overall energy consumption of buildings. On-site energy generation strategies should be reviewed using a business case approach, for its applicability in coordination with the building's energy-use reduction and energy conservation strategies.2.1.2.1 Site Investigations The following investigations should be completed on projects larger than a duplex-style building: Geotechnical Report Environmental Phase 1 (Phase 2 and 3, if/as required) Hydrant Flow Test Underground and aboveground utility locates Site Survey (Topographical & RPR) 2.1.2.2 Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design \"Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) is defined as a multi-disciplinary approach for reducing crime through urban and environmental design and the management and use of built environments. CPTED strategies aim to reduce victimization, deter offender decisions that precede criminal acts, and build a sense of community among inhabitants so they can gain territorial control of areas and reduce opportunities for crime and fear of crime. CPTED is pronounced 'sep-ted' and it is known around the world as Designing Out Crime, defensible space, and other similar terms. \" - International CPTED Association. CPTED is a main characteristic in developing safety and secure housing through Alberta and is required on each project that has a site development scope. BC Housing has developed a concise guideline for CPTED's application in housing and they are to be utilized for these projects. Refer to BC Housing Design Guidelines and Construction Standards Section 3.SITE2.1.2 Site DesignAlberta Social Housing Corporation | Design and Technical Guidelines SECTION 2: DESIGN GUIDELINES362.1.2.3 Site Analysis The following Key Considerations should be reviewed and developed: Review location, zoning and current codes to establish all municipal standards, including setbacks, height limitations, and other constraints on the site; Site Access; Transit Review; Neighbouring Amenity; Solar orientation to optimize building energy use and daylight accessibility; The impact of topography for optimal building location, site drainage, passive and active technologies, and landscaping; The impact of vegetation - increasing vegetation/trees around buildings can modify both daylight and thermal comfort in buildings; Develop landscape plans to provide windbreaks and shading and to minimize water demand, as well as to meet local Land Use bylaws; The extent to which the ground can act as a heat sink, based on the elevation of the water table relative to the frost line, and soil structure; Review site context to determine established neighbourhood ecological patterns that could be enhanced, such as water treatment and drainage patterns, green spaces, and pedestrian and transportation networks; If the functional program or retrofit results in an increased demand for parking, review opportunities for utilizing adjacent areas in lieu of increasing on-site parking; Measures to minimize construction damage to surface ecology; Measures to minimize impacts on subsurface ecology and aquifers; If the project is located on a site with a previous building footprint, for sustainability reasons, strive to place the building on the existing building footprint; Identify locations of all utilities, including water, sewer, gas and power, and identify the utility providers for each of these services; Prepare a topographical survey of the site to identify drainage and elevations needed to achieve accessible movement on the site; and Identify traffic around the site and, if applicable, engage a Transportation Engineer to complete a Transportation Impact Assessment. 2.1.2.4 Site Planning For larger sites, a Master Plan may be created in which potential phasing of existing and future developments may be included. The main focus of the Site Planning should be on the integration of landscaping and the future building. The dominant focus of Site Planning for all Housing Accommodation Types should reside in: Building placement and orientation, which impacts: Passive Design Strategies Access and parking Rainwater strategy Site furniture Low-maintenance planting with all-season aestheticsAlberta Social Housing Corporation | Design and Technical Guidelines 37 SECTION 2: DESIGN GUIDELINESThe building design is typically developed during the Pre-design, Schematic Design and Design Development phases of a project by combining the Site Design with the Building location, use, functional program and building intent, through form. Before the Building Design can begin, the following functional program items need to be considered: Recheck the functional requirements and spatial relationships; Recheck the business plan and ProForma; Flexibility and provision for expansion; Special equipment and systems; Site requirements; Construction budget; Timeframe or schedule; and Provide multiple design options to match the multiple proformas. 2.1.3.1 Building Massing This is the first step in the Building Design and is a three- dimensional 'massing' confirmation of the key issues of the project, as well as an agreement on the architectural form to accommodate them. This is part of the preliminary analysis - a series of space diagrams to identify the comparative size and relationships of the functional areas and spaces required can be produced. This Massing form should be based on a design brief or functional program. Building Massing is a study of various planning and massing relationships, always within the constraints of sustainability and the project budget. Building Massing should be generated based on: Completeness of response to program elements; Success in resolving functional relationships and adjacency requirements; Compliance with previously established sustainable goals; The merits of alternative structural, mechanical and electrical systems;Comparisons of building efficiencies, including: Ratio of net to gross floor areas; Ratio between circulation and usable floor areas; Wall surface to floor area ratios; and Capital, operating, and maintenance costs. In addition to the above, the following should be considered in the design of the building: Incorporating appropriate construction materials and methods; Ensuring compliance with building codes; Dealing with occupational health and safety codes; and Ensuring that local zoning and urban design requirements are met. From Building Massing studies, the following can be established and determined: The sculptural quality of the building; The space between buildings (proposed and existing); and The effect of sun, shade, snow, rain and wind on the project and its surrounding environment. Furthermore, an Integrated Design Process helps to ensure that all building systems and components, such as site design, structure, orientation, envelope, lighting and ventilation are viewed as interdependent. During the massing phase, the integrated design team, including structural, mechanical and electrical engineers, as well as other specialist sub-consultants, may be required.BUILDING2.1.3 Building DesignAlberta Social Housing Corporation | Design and Technical Guidelines SECTION 2: DESIGN GUIDELINES38The Functional Program further refines the site and building design from the previous section, allowing for programs and spaces to be designed within the building massing. The Functional Program Matrix can confirm the program requirements and net area maximum and minimums suggested for the Housing Accommodation Type utilized. The design for all housing types should accommodate Occupants' need for comfort, safety, independence and dignity. It is important to ensure sufficient flexibility to accommodate potential changes in needs, Occupant populations and types of care. In planning the Residential unit spaces and building spaces, the needs and wants of the present and future Occupants should be balanced. This subsection describes the requirements for each space type. See 'Functional Program Matrix' for the space summary outline of program space maximums and minimums. The following is a summary of the space types, or \"programs,\" that are used throughout all housing accommodation types. Net Area: Is measured from the finished surface of a demising wall. Building measurements are to follow ANSI/BOMA Z65.4-2010-Multi-Unit Residential Buildings Standard Methods of Measurement.Occupant Unit Spaces: UNIT TYPES IN-UNIT SPACES IN-UNIT AMENITIES Building Spaces: BUILDING AMENITIES BUILDING SUPPORT SPACES PARKING CIRCULATION AND OTHER SPACES2.2 Functional Program 2.2.1 Functional Program MatrixAlberta Social Housing Corporation | Design and Technical Guidelines 39 SECTION 2: DESIGN GUIDELINESFUNCTIONAL PROGRAM MATRIX SECTIONS & PAGES Alberta Seniors & Housing Design Guidlines & Technical Standards Accommodation Matrix 8/29/2019 13:00:16 1Alberta Social Housing Corporation - Space Program Matrix recommended Space CategoriesSpaces NotesFamily and Community Housing Development and RenewalSeniors' Housing Development and RenewalNew Housing Supply - Affordable and Specialized HousingUnits Areas Single Family ResidenceMulti-Unit ResidenceApartmentSeniors' Independent LivingSeniors' LodgeSeniors' Lodge with Supportive LivingPermanent Supportive Housing# of UnitsMin Proposed Net Area (sqft)Max Proposed Net Area (sqft)Total AreaRESIDENT UNIT SPACESUnit Types Unit TypesBachelor - No Kitchen - - - - 275 450 Bachelor - Kitchenette - - - - 275 450 Bachelor - With Kitchen - - - - - 275 450 One Bedroom - 450 600 Two Bedroom + - - - 700 900 Three Bedroom + - - - - 900 1,100 Unit Amenities Unit AmenitiesIn-Suite Laundry Washing personal laundry - - - - - In-Suite Living Room - included in above areas where applicable In-Suite Storage - - - -BUILDING SPACESBuilding Amenities Common SpacesCommon Dining RoomWhere not in suites - per occupant - - - - 10/occupant 15/occupant For resident use rather than commercial - - - - 100 200 Common Laundry Where not in suites - per 50 suites or less - 100 200 Common Lounge Per occupant - - 10/occupant 20/occupant Common/ Public WashroomsPer Alberta Building Code - - - Waiting AreaSpace near entrance for visitors and occupants- - - 50 150 Health ServicesAssisted Bathing RoomPer occupant [minumum one room for up to 20 people]- - - - - - 250 450 Health Care RoomNurse office, infirmary, specialized care, or other health care functions - one room for up to 150 occupants- - - 300 500 Medication Room Secure and private room - - - - 75 150 Indoor Amenity SpacesFitness Room One per up to 150 occupants - - - - 200 800 Multipurpose RoomGathering/Activity space with kitchen or kitchenette- - - 10/occupant 20/occupant Reflection SpaceSpiritual growth, personal reflection, religious gatherings, smudging- - - 200 500 Alberta Seniors & Housing Design Guidlines & Technical Standards Accommodation Matrix 8/29/2019 13:00:16 2Alberta Social Housing Corporation - Space Program Matrix recommended Space CategoriesSpaces NotesFamily and Community Housing Development and RenewalSeniors' Housing Development and RenewalNew Housing Supply - Affordable and Specialized HousingUnits Areas Single Family ResidenceMulti-Unit ResidenceApartmentSeniors' Independent LivingSeniors' LodgeSeniors' Lodge with Supportive LivingPermanent Supportive Housing# of UnitsMin Area (sqft)Total AreaBUILDING SPACESOutdoor Amenity SpacesCovered Gathering Area Coordinate smoking area with local bylaws - Green Space / Garden Community Gardens - Optional - Building Support Spaces StorageStorage for Bicycles Coordinate with local bylaws 100 300 Storage RoomStorage for staff and residents - per occupant 10/occupant 20/occupant Storage for Mobility AidsSpecial consideration to walker parking during meal time - per occupant- - - - 6/occupant 12/occupant Administration and Program Support ServicesManagement OfficeOffice space for administration staff - per staff person- - - 15/staff 25/staff Staff Room Including break room with lockers - - - - 250 550 Staff Washroom Shower and changing facilities - - - - 50 75 Building OperationsCommercial/Community KitchenStaff prepares food in a commercial kitchen - minimum 500 sqft + additional area per occupant.- - - - 5/occupant 10/occupant Industrial Size Laundry (Linen Service)Staff provide laundry and linen services on site for residents- - - - 150 500 IT Infrastructure - InternetIntegrated Internet infrastructure in building - allow are for IT closet per storey 10 20 Janitor's RoomsDedicated room for cleaning supplies and janitorial storage - per storey- - 15 25 Heat Treatment RoomSpecialized room for treating furniture items at high temperature to eliminate pests.

Designers and builders must comply with the requirements in the most up-to-date , prior to construction to avoid errors and costly renovations. The Codes for barrier-free design exist to regulate a proper and safe outcome for accessibility. As outlined in the most up-to-date Barrier-Free Design Guide, a best practice guide that assists with the interpretation and application of the National Building Code of Canada, Alberta Edition and best practices for barrier-free design, accessible design and universal design.ACCESSIBILITY 2.3.2 Accessible Site and Buildings Wheelchair accessible sites and buildings should be designed in accordance with all applicable Building Codes and specifically the most up-to-date National Building Code of Canada, Alberta Edition. Reference should also be made to the most up-to-date Barrier Free Design Guide and the CAN/CSA B651-04 Accessible Design for the Built Environment for further barrier-free design guidelines and best practices. ACCESSIBLE SITES For site accessibility, see Section: Landscaping. Reference also the current Barrier Free Design Guide: Section 3: 'Site Development' for accessibility to the: Site Outdoor spaces Parking Curbs Exterior walks and ramps Section 11: 'Outdoor Spaces' for further barrier-free design guidelines that reference accessibility to: Outdoor public use eating areas Recreational trails Beach access routes and boardwalks Recreational trail design Inclusive play spaces (where applicable) ACCESSIBLE BUILDINGS Reference the current Barrier Free Design Guide: Section 1 - General Application of Barrier-Free Design Section 4 - Circulation Section 5 - Public Facilities (where applicable) Section 6 - Adaptable Dwelling Units Section 7 - Residential Requirements2.3.1 Housing Accommodation Types and Accessibility 'Single Family Residence' and 'Multi-Unit Residence' may be exempt from barrier-free requirements with confirmation from Alberta Social Housing Corporation. This design guideline suggests that no housing accommodation type should be excluded from accessibility and barrier-free guidelines and should implement them as best practice. Consider Occupant requirements and reference all applicable Codes and Barrier-Free Design Guidelines to assist in the design of accessibility and the housing accommodation type.Alberta Social Housing Corporation | Design and Technical Guidelines 67 SECTION 2: DESIGN GUIDELINESACCESSIBLE UNITS CHARTACCESSIBLE UNITS Housing Accommodation Types require a percentage of units that must be designed to allow universal access. Accessible units should be designed with all applicable Building Codes and the Barrier Free Design Guide and the CAN/CSA B651-04 Accessible Design for the Built Environment.ADAPTABLE UNITS An adaptable unit refers to a dwelling unit that has been designed to allow future alteration to make the dwelling unit consistent with the principles of barrier-free design. These design features will then allow the space that is to be altered to become fully barrier-free with minimal renovations and cost at a later date. There must be flexibility incorporated into the dwelling units at the time of construction. As an example, if a dwelling unit is inhabited by an able-bodied person in addition to a person who uses a wheelchair, the heights at which the kitchen counters are installed become an issue. Flexibility must allow the height of different work stations to be raised or lowered so that the dwelling unit may be converted one way or the other in order to cater to the needs of its Occupant tenants.Code Minimum (10%)More than Code - On Project by Project Basis100% Family & Community Housing Development & Renewal Single Family DwellingYes Multi-Unit Residence Yes Apartment Yes Seniors Housing Development & Renewal Seniors' Independent LivingYes Seniors' Lodge Yes Seniors' Lodge with Supportive LivingYes New Housing Supply - Affordable & Specialized Housing Permanent Supportive HousingYes3 SECTION 3: TECHNICAL GUIDELINES SECTION BREAKDOWN This SECTION 3: DESIGN GUIDELINES of the Alberta Social Housing Corporation Design and Technical Guidelines provides direction for the following Building Systems: 3.1 Architectural Systems 3.1.1 Building Exterior 3.1.2 Building Interior 3.2 Furniture and Equipment 3.2.1 Furniture & Equipment Matrix 3.3 Mechanical Systems 3.3.1 General Mechanical 3.3.2 Fire and Life Safety Systems 3.3.3 Plumbing 3.3.4 Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning 3.4 Electrical Systems 3.4.1 Power Systems 3.4.2 Lighting 3.4.3 Communication Systems 3.4.4 Fire Alarm System 3.4.5 Security Systems 3.4.6 Card Access System 3.5 Landscaping SystemsAlberta Social Housing Corporation | Design and Technical Guidelines SECTION 3: TECHNICAL GUIDELINES70ARCHITECTURAL3.1 Architectural Systems 3.1.1 Building Exterior The main aesthetic of the exterior is the building envelope. It acts as the separation between the interior and the exterior in our Alberta environment. Designing these components correctly is important to ensure building durability, health, longevity and energy performance. 3.1.1.1 Thermal Performance Alberta has a wide range of climate considerations that should be accounted for: wind, rain, snow, temperature and solar heat. The National Energy Code for Canada for Buildings puts Alberta into Climate Zones 6, 7A, 7B and 8 (see National Energy Code of Canada for Buildings) and permits a range of thermal performances. At minimum, all buildings must meet the National Energy Code for Buildings - Alberta edition. Reducing the thermal transmittance to 1.4W/m2.k for windows is specifically required to reduce energy use and increase occupant comfort. The following chart provides the recommended thermal performance values for Alberta Social Housing Corporation. 3.1.1.2 Rai nscreen and Insulated Structure To increase building performance and durability, and to reduce risk of water leakage and moisture build-up, all projects should use the following assembly construction methods. Pressure Equalized Rain Screen and Insulated Structure Technique (PERSIST): Should be used in all exterior wall assemblies of new construction. The cladding material must be designed as a rainscreen and the building superstructure should be insulated on the exterior to protect it from thermal variations. Renovations to existing assemblies should, at minimum, use rainscreen cladding. Insulated Structure: Roof insulation should cover the building structure. Flat roofs should include continuous insulation connecting to the exterior that does not permit building structure to be This Section provides the baseline standard architectural requirements for the building exterior and interior systems for new construction, major and minor renovation, and conversion housing projects. The building exterior includes; thermal performance, rainscreen and insulated structure, building envelope materials, exterior doors and radon prevention. Where the building interior includes; partition and walls, carpentry, finish carpentry, doors, flooring, interior painting finishes, acoustics, window blinds and elevators. Architectural systems should be designed and built to meet or exceed all applicable codes, standards, organizational requirements, and legislations. All architectural systems should be designed to take into consideration their durability, sustainability, modesty, and quality. Potential for expandability for future modifications are highly suggested where appropriate. Innovation in design, flexibility, and technological sustainability is highly encouraged.Alberta Social Housing Corporation | Design and Technical Guidelines 71 SECTION 3: TECHNICAL GUIDELINESthermally exposed. Sloped roofs with blown-in insulation can be used, provided that the roof edge to exterior wall connection has a continuous and robust thermal connection and a continuous AVB. It is recommended that sloped roofs increase their insulation value to reduce structural degradation from thermal expansion and contraction. 3.1.1.3 Building Envelope Materials Alberta Social Housing Corporation does not specify or recommend distinct products or materials; rather, this document sets out performance guidelines. All materials should be selected to reduce ongoing maintenance and consider capital cost. Roofing: Roofing on all building should be designed to meet the above noted criteria and also the Roofing Application Standards Manual by the Alberta Roofing Contractors Association (ARCA). Roofing materials and installations should be provided with a warranty of not less than ten years. It is recommended that large facilities are warrantied for not less than 15 years. A licensed Roofing Inspector should inspect all roof installations. Cladding: Cladding should be designed to enhance human delight, respect the community, and provide a welcoming home to the Occupants. Cladding is to be resilient and durable and must be provided as PERSIST. Low grade vinyl siding is not to be used. Exterior Windows and Glazing: Exterior glazing should meet the following requirements: Thermal: as a full system, the thermal performance should be as noted above. It is recommended that the glazed unit be 0.95 W/(m2K). Solar Heat Gain Coefficient: - South exposure: 0.3, maximum - North, west, east exposure: 0.5, maximum Visible Light Transmittance (VT): 50%, minimum Operability: All sleeping rooms and living rooms should have operable units. Performance Testing: A pressure and water testing procedure should be created for window testing on each project. Windows in public spaces, sleeping rooms, and suites should be built with interior sills. This will provide space for indoor planting and shelving, and increase occupant comfort. Concrete: Consider reduction in the amount of heat-absorptive, impervious paved surfaces that may contribute to the heat island effect. Consider the use of supplementary cementing materials (SCMs) to increase the recycled content of concrete. Dampproofing and Waterproofing: Dampproof all concrete foundation walls below grade enclosing non-habitable basements and parkades as determined by the consultant. Waterproof all foundation walls below grade enclosing habitable basements and parkades, storage areas, exterior balconies, service rooms, stairs and all below grade walls where deemed necessary by the Geotechnical Report and a Building Envelope Consultant. Waterproof suspended concrete slabs and decks over habitable space and balconies over uninhabited space. Extend membrane continuously under planters and upstands \u2014 use of a concrete \"pre-curb\" is recommended. Waterproof membrane assembly should be designed to prevent penetration of the membrane by root systems at planter areas \u2014 a minimum 0.50 mm (20 mil) High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) sheet is recommended or a proprietary root barrier. Facility Fall Protection: All projects are to provide a fall protection system that complies to the Alberta OH&S Code, Regulations, and Act Part 9. Roof accesses should conform to the Alberta OH&S Code, Regulations, and Act Part 9.Alberta Social Housing Corporation | Design and Technical Guidelines SECTION 3: TECHNICAL GUIDELINES723.1.1.4 Exterior Doors Single Family and Multi-Unit: Doors are to be minimum 1000 mm clear width Weather stripping products should be easily replaceable All other buildings: Doors should be minimum 1000 mm clear width Barrier-free operators on entrance doors Panic hardware on exit doors Weather stripping products should be easily replaceable 3.1.1.5 Radon Prevention Radon prevention should be installed to meet the National Building of Canada - Alberta Edition. In addition, all projects should install the gas removal venting system and vent soil gases to the exterior. Overhead Garage Doors: Coordinate the gate operation with the Owner's Building security access system, if required. Provide controls for door in downward motion to immediately stop and fully open upon contact with obstruction. Provide weather stripping to maintain effective air seal for specified design wind load pressure range and within Project design temperature range. In the event of a power failure, operator must be capable of being released from door by use of a quick release door arm for manual operation. 3.1.2 Building Interior 3.1.2.1 Partitions and Walls in all buildings, partition walls and party walls between suites and sleeping rooms should be constructed per the construction methods required by the Building Code and account for acoustic separation and fire separations. It is important that these walls are constructed such that gases do not transfer from one suite to another. Partitions and walls will provide a continuous, air-sealed barrier that connects at the base of the wall, up through to the wall, to underside of structure. Concrete board or moisture resistant gypsum board should be used behind any interior vertical surface encountering water (bathrooms, backsplash, etc.) 3.1.2.2 Carpentry GENERAL Composite wood should not exceed 0.05 ppm of formaldehyde. Reference California Air Resources Board (CARB) ultra-low-emitting formaldehyde (ULEF). Where possible, wood products are recommended to be certified according to the requirements of one of the four internationally recognized third-party audited certification systems. Paints, coatings, adhesives and sealants must not contain methylene chloride and perchloroethylene. Paints and coatings must meet Canadian Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Concentration Limits for Architectural Coatings Regulations (SOR/2009-264). Architectural Paints and Coatings are to be lead and mercury-free. Sealants and Adhesives should contain no urea formaldehyde. Alberta Social Housing Corporation | Design and Technical Guidelines 73 SECTION 3: TECHNICAL GUIDELINES3.1.2.3 Finish Carpentry COUNTERTOPS AND CABINET DOORS AND DRAWERS Finish carpentry should be designed to be visually appealing, Residential and home-like in appearance. Special attention to be given to the quality of materials used. Materials must be robust, easily cleaned and easily replaceable at the end of their service life. Special consideration should be given when selecting hardware that is robust and easily operated. High-pressure plastic laminate finishes are preferred for both countertops and base cabinets, including both sides of doors, drawer fronts and case goods. The interior of the case goods should be finished in a material that is robust and easy to clean. Countertops should be in a color that contrasts with the base and upper cabinets. Consider accommodating varying, barrier-free requirements for various levels of accessibility, based on the intended use of the space. Consider providing panels that can be easily removed to provide a wheelchair-accessible countertop surface. Countertop edge to be a continuous, post-form profile without site-applied, high-pressure plastic laminate strip to the leading edge, as this can easily delaminate over time. Avoid busy or prominent patterning or abrupt shifts in color/pattern in plastic laminate finishes. Backsplashes to be finished in a material that is durable, easy to clean and has minimal patterning. Large porcelain tiles are preferred to small tile, as this results in fewer grout joints. Kitchens should have under-cabinet lighting with simple, easy to operate controls. Millwork substrate material should be dense, stable and long lasting. Use plywood or hardwood as the substrate. Millwork materials must not contain any PVC material, or any other off-gassing materials. Millwork pulls should be large D-pull or lever-style pull with no mobile operators or recessed components. Knobs, recessed pulls, edge pulls, and touch latch hardware should not be used. As the population ages, mobility becomes increasingly difficult. To encourage and assist in Occupant mobility, handrails should be provided in circulation and common spaces, as well as units. Handrails should be designed according to details annotated in the Barrier Free Design Guide. Items should be installed in accordance with the North American Architectural Woodwork Standards (AWMAC) Manual. 3.1.2.4 Doors Interior doors are one of the most used components of these buildings. Selecting the correct door must account for durability, longevity, local replaceability, and accessibility. Solid core doors are recommended throughout the interior for non-service room doors. Wood doors are preferred inside suites, sleeping rooms, and closets. Hollow core molded doors are not to recommended because of their low durability. Kick-plates should be provided on the push side of the all doors. This standard size allows for general accessibility and replacement. Large doors are required for Accessible Units (see Section: Accessibility and units within Designated Supportive Living). In addition, the design of a doorway must allow for unrestricted access - both ingress and egress - from a space by ensuring that at least 600 mm (3'-0\") of clear space exists on the latch side of the door to allow a person in a wheelchair, or those using other mobility aids, ease of movement and safety. Using sliding doors inside barrier-free units is recommended to optimize floor space and to avoid designing turning radius in collision with door swing. D-pulls and door levers should be used instead of knobs. A card access system is recommended on all buildings.Alberta Social Housing Corporation | Design and Technical Guidelines SECTION 3: TECHNICAL GUIDELINES743.1.2.5 Flooring Flooring selections should be carefully considered to be beautiful, hard-wearing and non-slip, and to create a welcoming environment. A suitable flooring selection is important in creating a space where risks to health and safety of Occupants and staff are minimized. In senior living communities, flooring must be chosen for not only its' aesthetics, but also to create a safe, clean, durable and stable foundation that will meet the requirements of the aging population. Finishes will be selected in appropriate color for the demands of changes in vision as people age. As people age, changes occur in their peripheral vision, while color and night vision can also shift. The aging population may also experience changes in the eye's lens, resulting in all colors appearing more yellow and less saturated. Flooring should be resilient and provide some 'give' or 'cushion' when walked upon. Excessively hard floors can lead to increased slip/fall incidents. The use of carpet or other absorptive materials should be avoided on the floor. The use of products that would create excessive seams should be avoided. Flooring in common areas and corridors should be sheet flooring, rather than tile or strips. As one ages, their sensitivity to glare increases, thus flooring should not be shiny or produce any excessive glare. Flooring should not have sharp, contrasting patterns or changes in color. Depending on the type of facility, the shifts in color can be disorienting to the aging population, resulting in Occupants walking around or specifically avoiding high contrast/patterned areas. Flooring color should be contrasting from wall and base colors. This allows Occupants to more clearly gauge the extent of the space and safely navigate throughout the facility. Contrasting flooring color must be used at stairs, nosing and landings to accommodate people with differing vision needs. All stairs are to be designed to meet details annotated in the Barrier Free Design Guidebook. Specified flooring should be stain-resistant and easily cleaned. Flooring should not require any topical coatings or waxing to maintain its beauty. Resilient and level thresholds should be provided at doorways between exterior and interior spaces. Entry vestibules should have recessed entrance matting systems that can be easily removed and cleaned. The entrance matting system should not include a floor drain, but rather a removable insert that can allow for the recessed concrete floor slab to be cleaned out. Flooring should not contain any PVC or other harmful, off-gassing materials. In Units, flooring with a wood plank appearance can be used for a Residential, home-like feel. Consider using contoured, millwork style rubber base to help enhance the Residential aesthetic. Showers are to have a contrasting, resilient, non-slip floor. Shower floor colour is to be contrasting from shower walls. The use of tile and grout should be avoided in unit washroom walls and floor. Use only non-permanent adhesives. 3.1.2.6 Interior Painting Finishes Similar to flooring, paint color should be carefully considered to ensure that walls and doors are contrasting from each other, as well as from the adjacent flooring. As with flooring, paint color selection can be strategically used to encourage or discourage Occupants from accessing certain corridors or doors. For example, painting a door in a color that blends to the adjacent wall makes it more difficult for certain Occupants to see, resulting in them being less likely to utilize that door. Avoid yellow or yellow-toned paint colors as they will appear more intense to the aging population due to the naturally occurring yellowing of the lens. Choose colors that contrast from each other and the adjacent finishes. Paint finishes should follow the Master Painter Institute (MPI) specifications. Use non-VOC paint. Do not use recycled paint. Alberta Social Housing Corporation | Design and Technical Guidelines 75 SECTION 3: TECHNICAL GUIDELINES3.1.2.7 Acoustics All Housing Accommodation Types require consideration of acoustical treatments throughout, and must meet required Sound Transmission Class (STC) and Impact Transmission Class (ITC) ratings for the occupancy type by Code. Acoustical treatments such as wall-mounted acoustic panels, and/or suspended ceiling acoustic clouds can be incorporated to resolve reverberation throughout housing types, generally in common lounges. Acoustical treatments should be incorporated into Independent Living, Seniors' Lodge, Seniors' Lodge with Supportive Living, Apartment and Permanent Supportive Housing, above others. STC rating of wall assemblies between units must be 55. 3.1.2.8 Window Blinds Design blinds to the following requirements: Child Safe. Be designed in a manner that allows wear susceptible parts to be replaceable by either the user or the manufacturer. A guarantee of at least five years of available replacement parts following discontinue of the products manufacture. A program that allows for the refurbishing or return of used blinds if possible. Be designed in a manner that permits effective disassembly of components in order to permit recycling of materials for which recycling markets exist. Include stamps on all major plastic components indicating composition code to facilitate recycling efforts. MATERIALS Fabric Drapes: Minimum density or weight of 326.0 grams per linear meter. Track: Heavy duty brackets to accommodate ceiling and/or wall mount. Roller Blinds: Fabrics: inherently anti-static, waterproof, washable, flame retardant to NFPA 701 and NFPA 703, fungal resistant to ASTM G21, fade and stain resistant. Operating system: chain drive pulley operating, consisting of metal clutch housing. Compliant with WCMA safety standard A 110.1. Bottom bar: sealed hem bar, extruded aluminum weight in a sealed fabric hem pocket provided uniform look. 3.1.2.9 Elevators Elevators should be provided where required by the Building Code. When elevators are required, provide at least two elevators, to ensure occupants are not stranded in their rooms when one elevator is not operational. Elevator dimensions should allow for a full ambulance stretcher wheeled in flat per the Alberta Building Code. All elevator equipment should be provided in conformance with Appendix E of the B44 Elevator Safety Code \"Elevator Requirements for Persons with Physical Disabilities\". Placement of the elevators should optimize floor area and be combined with stair shafts and service shafts.Alberta Social Housing Corporation | Design and Technical Guidelines SECTION 3: TECHNICAL GUIDELINES763.2.1 Furnitur e & Equipment Matrix The Furniture & Equipment Matrix below provides a recommended, and not recommended, furniture and equipment list for each Housing Accommodation Type based on General Items that should be included in the project, ASHC Capital Funded items in contract (I.C), and Housing Management Body Operating Funded items not in contract (N.I.C).F&E3.2 Furniture & Equipment Alberta Seniors & Housing Design Guidlines & Technical Standards F & E Matrix 1Alberta Social Housing Corporation - Furniture & Equipment Matrix recommended Items NotesFamily and Community Housing Development and RenewalSeniors' Housing Development and RenewalNew Housing Supply - Affordable and Specialized Housing Single Family ResidenceMulti-Unit ResidenceApartmentSeniors' Independent LivingSeniors' LodgeSeniors' Lodge with Supportive LivingPermanent Supportive Housing General Furniture & Equipment Wall-mounted shelves in Storage Rooms Gas fireplace In common lounge room - - - - - Privacy window curtain/blinds Facility exterior signage - - Facility interior signage - - Corner guard and corner guard rails - - Soap and paper towel dispenser in public washroom- - - - - Handrails - - - - Carbon monoxide detector Vehicle plug-in with programmable timer and thermostat - Gazebo As required - - - - - Building flagpole(s) - - - - - All kitchenette and commercial kitchen fixturesHood fan IC All washroom fixtures General Commercial Kitchen Equipment - - Assisted Bath Room Adjustable showerehead and/or privacy rod and curtains- - - - - Assisted bathtub units including ceiling tracks or floor lifts- - - - - Emergency Response System - - - - - Speaker system and speakers - - - Window coveringsTypically, privacy curtain/draperies are installed in resident unit/bedroom and blinds are installed in public areas Not in Contract (N.I.C.)

The strategies of harnessing solar radiation and capturing internal gains for heating and utilizing mechanical ventilation overnight to cool the warm building structures should be considered.Alberta Social Housing Corporation | Design and Technical Guidelines 81 SECTION 3: TECHNICAL GUIDELINES3.3.1.3 Accessibility for Mechanical Systems Servicing Sufficient access space is to be provided for servicing, maintaining and removal of equipment and system components. Service access requirements should be shown on drawings. This includes items such as tube bundles, coils, filter media, motors or any other items which may, over the course of time, require service, repair, or replacement. Mechanical room pumps should be arranged such that all pumps have minimum 600 mm clear service clearance to one side of each pump. Duplex pump configurations should be located as a pair with 600 mm service clearance on both sides. Where pump mounted drives are used, service clearance must be increased to 1 m. All equipment that requires regular testing, such as reduced pressure backflow preventers, should be installed less than 1500 mm above finished floor. Heating and chilled water systems should have chemical treatment equipment located in a way that permits access and service from the floor without reaching over piping or equipment. Where rooftop equipment is not mounted directly to the roof surface using curbs, provide a minimum clearance of 300 mm between underside of roof mounted equipment and roof surfaces to allow for maintenance of the roof membrane. Protection should be provided to prevent birds from roosting within the void space below the equipment. Where rooftop equipment is used, indicate fall arrest protections, safety clearances, and service clearances on the mechanical roof plan. In general, except for slab heating and drainage systems, mechanical systems should not be located within slab or below slab-on-grade.3.3.1.4 Mechanical Systems Winterization Winterization requirements should be incorporated into design.

Winterization systems should be commissioned and identified to maintenance staff during training. 3.3.2 Fire and Life S afety Systems A complete sprinkler system should be provided for buildings in conformance with National Building Code - Alberta Edition, the Alberta Fire Code, and the National Fire Protection Agency, and as required by local Authority Having Jurisdiction. Fire pumps, where required, should be in accordance with the National Building Code, the Alberta Fire Code, and the requirements of NFPA 20, Standard for the Installation of Stationary Pumps for Fire Protection. Sprinkler systems should be provided in accordance with the National Building Code, the Alberta Fire Code, and the requirements of NFPA 13, Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems. Sprinklers subject to damage should be protected by sprinkler guards. In areas with low ceiling (bulkheads) or where cleaning/sanitization of the heads will be required, sprinklers should be of the concealed type. Fire extinguishers should be provided in accordance with the National Building Code, the Alberta Fire Code, and the requirements of NFPA 10, Standard for Portable Fire Extinguishers. Recessed, or semi-recessed, cabinets should be provided for fire extinguishers in public areas. The cabinet type should be coordinated with the Architect. 3.3.3 Plumbing POTABLE WATER SUPPLY Approved back flow prevention should be installed to CAN/CSA-64 requirements, and in conformance with the Nation Plumbing Code and local requirements, for all facilities.Alberta Social Housing Corporation | Design and Technical Guidelines SECTION 3: TECHNICAL GUIDELINES82Water pressure is to be regulated to between 300kPa and 550kPa. Where pressure booster pumps are required in DSL facilities, the number and arrangement of pumps should be such that peak demand can be met in the event of a failure of any single pump. Alarms should be provided to indicate failure of a pumping unit and low primary water supply pressure. Alarms should be annunciated to the building automation system as well as sounded in a continuous supervised location. Potable water systems must be chemically or thermally treated for sanitization immediately prior to occupancy. All domestic hot water piping is to be insulated throughout in accordance with the National Energy Code of Canada for Buildings regardless of the piping material used. Domestic cold-water piping must be insulated and have a continuous vapour barrier to avoid condensation. Care must be taken to ensure that the insulation and vapour barrier are continuous at hangers and support and at wall and floor penetrations. Plumbing fixture supplies need not be insulated, except fixture supplies on barrier-free lavatories (e.g. stops, supplies, traps, and drains). Domestic water heating should be achieved by dedicated domestic water heaters or boilers and storage tanks that are separate from the building heating system, unless a combined system is fundamental to the energy conservation strategy. Multiple water heaters should be provided to ensure redundancy for all domestic water heating and storage equipment. Instantaneous domestic water heaters are acceptable for use only when installed close to the point-of-use and where the application requires it. A water softener or filtration system should be specified for all instantaneous domestic hot water installations. For single family residences and multi-unit residences, use a domestic hot water tank. Domestic hot water recirculation systems should be provided with tempering valves on all domestic hot water systems. Branch piping from a fixture to a circulated main should not exceed 6 m. Balanced flow domestic hot water recirculation systems should be provided throughout the facility by using balancing valves or inline automatic flow control valve to limit flow in hot water recirculating piping to 0.7 m/s to minimize erosion and corrosion, and ensure balanced flow. Domestic hot water storage temperature should not be below 60\u00b0C in order to control the potential propagation of Legionella bacteria. Except in commercial kitchen areas and janitor's rooms, hot water temperature must not exceed 49\u00b0C at the point of use by Occupants. Digital tempering valves with a fail- safe high limit shut-off should be provided at the point of supply. Distribution temperature is to be controlled to 46\u00b0C for all general use fixtures, with safety shut-off at 50\u00b0C. SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SUPPORTIVE LIVING Where healthcare is provided, CAN/CSA Z317.1, Special Requirements for Plumbing Installations in Health Care Facilities applies. This outlines the requirements for reliable and adequate alternative water supply such that the service to the healthcare facility is not significantly interrupted in the event of failure of the primary potable water supply. If the provision of an alternative water supply is not practical, the potential risk associated with a failure of the primary service should be assessed and a plan developed that describes the procedure required to maintain services with minimal interruption. Parallel, approved backflow prevention devices, each sized for full-flow capacity, should be installed on the main water service to ensure water availability during testing and maintenance. Potable water distribution pumps, storage tanks and other main components should be provided with redundancy. DRAINAGE SYSTEMS Storm water drainage must be piped independently of the sanitary drainage system. Roof drainage should include two drains per drainage area and include cast steel or aluminum dome strainers. 25 mm of insulation is to be included on the underside of each drain body and the horizontal storm piping up to the first vertical drop. Where storm water is not directly connected to a municipal storm water service main, terminate roof drain exterior discharge outlet with an elbow at least 1.0 m (3 ft) above grade. Provide thermostatically controlled electric heat tracing inside the piping from the discharge back into the building to prevent freeze-up during the winter. The discharge should be directed so that it does not flow onto areas designated for pedestrian, play areas or vehicle Alberta Social Housing Corporation | Design and Technical Guidelines 83 SECTION 3: TECHNICAL GUIDELINEStraffic where it could freeze and become a safety hazard, or onto areas where it could cause erosion damage. Weeping tile and under slab drainage sumps should consist of two compartments (a settling compartment and a pumping compartment) if the amount of suspended matter is likely to interfere with the operation of the pumps or cause excessive wear. The pumping compartment should be sized to limit the frequency of pump starts to that recommended by the pump manufacturer. Sump pumps should be duplex, controlled to automatically alternate between lead/lag status, and have alarms for the lag pump start and high-water level. Interceptors should be provided in waste piping serving food preparation areas and hair salons with adequate service space, along with floor drains with trap primers or trap seals. Sewage pumps, where required, should be duplex, of the macerator type, controlled to automatically alternate between lead/lag status, and have alarms for the lag pump start and high-water level. Cast iron DWV piping should be used in vertical risers and over sound sensitive areas (sleeping quarters) and in parking garages. Resilient supports for waste stacks and rainwater leaders should be provided. Where a sump is required for an elevator shaft, the sump should be located remotely (outside) from the elevator shaft. PLUMBING FIXTURES AND EQUIPMENT Plumbing fixtures should be provided in accordance with the requirements of the National Plumbing Code. Fixtures should be white and each type should be of the same manufacturer with chrome-plated fixture trim and accessories. Barrier-free fixtures should be provided where required by the Building Code with installation in accordance with the requirement of CSA-B651, Accessible Design for the Built Environment and the Building Code. Coordinate to determine the specific mechanical rough- in requirements for Owner Supplied Equipment (i.e. washers and dryers, bedpan washers/disinfectors, kitchen equipment, etc.). Back-flow prevention devices should be provided as required.Water Closets: In general, flush-valve activated water closets are preferred in public areas over flush tank types. All water closets are to be vitreous china with high performance low-flush or dual-flush operation. Automatic flush valves should not be used except in public access areas. Where Bariatric Water Closets are required, provide floor-mounted heavy duty water closets, extra wide seat rated for 500 kg, and carriers or supports designed to hold the weight of the patient. Where bariatric water closets are not desired, but there is still a requirement for bariatric design, coordinate with the Housing Management Body to determine the desired fixture type. Consider the use of a floor-mounted, heavy-duty water closet compatible with a bariatric commode rated for 360 kg (800 lbs.) as an alternative. When a bariatric commode is being used, ensure that the flush valve assembly does not interfere with its operation or provide an unattached flush tank. All Occupant washrooms in Supportive Living facilities should have water closets suitable for barrier-free accessibility. Lavatories: Lavatories should be vitreous china or stainless steel. Single blade faucets should be used except in pubic access areas where automatic hands-free faucets are permitted. All Occupant washrooms in Supportive Living facilities should have lavatories suitable for barrier-free accessibility.

Design concepts should be reviewed by Alberta Social Housing Corporation and the owner and the systems are based on the facilities location and the capabilities of the facility maintenance staff. Hydronic heating systems are preferred over warm air heating systems. Heating systems should be designed to ensure that the building has sufficient capacity to continue operating with a minimum of two-thirds of its design load when the largest individual heating unit is out of service. Heating Water Systems: Provide a minimum of two boilers, each sized for a minimum of 65% of the design load. The heating plant should be sized to reflect the seasonal nature of the heating load to allow efficient operation under varying loads. Boilers should be specified to have a minimum boiler efficiency of 85% and include a packaged control system designed to operate the boiler at peak efficiency possible during non-peak loads. Provide fully modulating burner controls in all boiler sizes, where possible. The use of low-mass condensing boilers should be considered only where it can be shown the return temperature to the boilers can be maintained in the condensing range for a significant portion of the heating season. Use variable speed drives on pumps and two-way control valves on terminal devices to maintain system design pressure under variable flow conditions. Indicate the sensor location(s) on the plans. Provide 100% redundancy for heating water pumps.Alberta Social Housing Corporation | Design and Technical Guidelines 85 SECTION 3: TECHNICAL GUIDELINES Where finned radiation is used behind millwork, ensure there is access for cleaning. Consider the use of radiant panels in Occupant rooms and where perimeter furniture and cabinets restrict the use of finned radiation. Use special care when locating radiant panel thermostats. The radiant panel should be controlled as first stage heating before the air system reheat coil (where present). Do not schedule the temperature of the radiant panel water heating system so low as to adversely affect the performance of the panel when combined with other types of terminal heating equipment. Consider architectural details, window coverings, and perimeter air supply outlets in the use of radiant panel heating systems. Ensure that perimeter glazing is completely exposed to the radiation effect. For Supportive Living facilities, provide an ancillary heating connection on the outside of the building for temporary connection to a portable boiler under emergency conditions and a means to allow for load shedding to match essential loads against available boiler capacity. Electric resistive heating should be discouraged except where it can be shown that renewable energy can provide a significant majority of the power requirements. Where electric heating is used, built-in thermostats will not be permitted. Aesthetics and quality should be considered in the selection of electric heaters. Forced air furnaces should be ENERGY STAR rated for high-efficiency operation with minimum 95% AFUE and sealed combustion. In DSL facilities, furnaces should be arranged in tandem or multiple units in a manner that allows a minimum 50% operation in the event that one furnace fails. COOLING Passive strategies should be considered to reduce cooling requirements. Except where passive cooling strategies are employed, and meet the cooling load requirements, provide mechanical cooling for all amenity and administration areas, and as required for Occupant suites. Window mounted air-conditioners should not be permitted. Where mechanical cooling is employed, allow for system redundancy to ensure a minimum of 50% available capacity when the largest single component is not in service. Where central systems are used to serve multiple dwelling units, the failure of any single system component must not result in the complete loss of cooling. Chilled water cooling is preferred for systems over 200 kW of total cooling capacity. Provide multiple compressors for chillers over 70 kW output. Provide at least two stages of capacity for compressors over 25 kW output and at least three stages of capacity for compressors over 125 kW output. Chillers with three stages of capacity control or less should have an additional hot gas bypass stage. In Supportive Living Facilities Provide a means of limiting summer interior temperatures in Occupant rooms, such as through the use of operable windows, where possible. Mechanical cooling systems should be provided for dining areas, corridors, program/activity areas, lounges, kitchens and laundry spaces. Occupant bedrooms should have an air tempering system to keep space temperature at a level that considers Occupant comfort and needs. Individual temperature control should be provided. VENTILATION System Design All rooms and areas should be ventilated to ensure an air exchange adequate to control contaminant levels, temperature, and humidity, while minimizing stratification and drafts. - For senior's facilities, limiting the supply air temperature to a minimum of 15\u00b0C should be considered. Suites should comply with the requirements of Part 9, Section 9.32 of the National Building Code. Ventilation system should comply with ASHRAE Standard 62- 2001 \"Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality\", except Addendum N.Alberta Social Housing Corporation | Design and Technical Guidelines SECTION 3: TECHNICAL GUIDELINES86 All major ventilation systems should include heat recovery with a minimum sensible heat recovery effectiveness of 75%. - Options for air bypass or other means of arresting heat recovery should be incorporated for all heat recovery systems to utilize shoulder season or summer night-time cooling. - Wherever practically possible, all Part 3 buildings should be provided with a central HRV system. Systems must be capable of continuously delivering required ventilation air to the Occupant spaces regardless of the requirement for space conditioning. Using a combination of heating/cooling coil and providing mechanical cooling of ventilation air is a preferred option as it improves indoor air quality in Occupant suites. - Utilizing corridor pressurization as means for providing ventilation for Occupant suites is NOT permitted. Should be ducted to the central heat recovery ventilation air handling unit from all bathrooms in Occupant suites. - Bathroom exhaust should be activated by a light switch and a moisture sensor. - Bathroom exhaust should be high capacity. Supply air should be distributed to all bedrooms and living areas. Supply and exhaust ducts should be distributed in the corridor ceiling plenums, where possible. Consider using multiple systems, where required, to limit size of distribution ducts. Non-insulated flexible duct connectors should be made from coated fiberglass cloth mechanically locked together with a scuff-protecting galvanized steel helix. Where central ventilation systems are required to serve common and amenity areas, in addition to Occupant suites, provide a separate heat recovery ventilation unit for the amenity areas to allow scheduled shut down during unoccupied hours. Provide MERV 8 pre-filters and MERV 13 final filters in all air handling units (as a minimum). Where individual in-unit heat recovery ventilators (HRVs) are used, they should be installed with sufficient access for maintenance and servicing. HRVs should be provided with Electronically Commutated Motors (ECMs) on supply and exhaust fans. An air bypass option that allows the use of \"free cooling\" should be incorporated. An HRV in an Occupant suite should be ducted to all bathrooms on the exhaust side and provide fresh air to all bedrooms and living areas. HRVs should operate continuously at a low speed and should automatically turn into a high speed by turning on a switch in any bathroom. Provide mechanical exhaust ventilation and make- up air system for common underground or enclosed parking areas. The system should be controlled by CO and combustible gas sensors. Install CO sensors 1.5 m and combustible gas sensors 150 mm above the floor level. Locate parking exhaust louvers a minimum of 3 m (10 ft) clear of any operable window or fresh air intake.Alberta Social Housing Corporation | Design and Technical Guidelines 87 SECTION 3: TECHNICAL GUIDELINESBUILDING AUTOMATION On projects with more than 10 units, use BACnet compliant Direct Digital Control (DDC) Energy Management Control System (EMCS) to: Control heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems Execute control strategies to minimize energy consumption Monitor and record mechanical systems performance Provide dial out of alarm signals and ability to monitor system from a remote location Provide commercially available, field-proven control systems that should be installed, engineered, and commissioned by trained and qualified personnel employed by companies that can provide an acceptable level of service after completion of the Contract.

Separated into two parts, the landscaping section first defines the requirements that apply to all projects, then provides specific requirements for each Housing Accommodation type. When required, the integration of accessible and universal design for all housing accommodation types is important. For all landscape designs, refer to the current version of Barrier Free Design Guide and Universal Design Guide.3.5.1 Requirements For All Projec ts SITE AND NEIG HBOURHOOD INTEGRATION Landscape design should be complementary to the building(s) and the site, enhancing the image of the neighborhood. Design open spaces to complement the site's natural features. Closely integrate the landscape design with the design of the building(s) to provide for a strong interior- exterior connection. Ensure all local Zoning bylaws are met for the screening of utilities, the selection and quantity of plants, and the location and type of parking and fencing. Landscaping should be low maintenance. WEATHER AND ENVIRONMENT When positioning and massing the building(s), consider where the outdoor areas will be located. Locate building(s) mass to shelter outdoor areas from prevailing winds and weather. Consider sun, shade, shelter, and the microclimate that the outdoor spaces will offer. Outdoor areas should be oriented to provide at least three hours per day of direct sun exposure at the winter solstice. Site planning and landscape design should take into consideration Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) strategies. Retain existing vegetation, where possible. SITE DRAINAGE A comprehensive storm water management strategy should be developed at an early stage of design. The strategy must also review run-off from and onto adjacent sites. Implement sustainable strategies such as rain gardens, bio-swales, stormwater retention and stormwater treatment, where possible.3.5 Landscaping SystemsAlberta Social Housing Corporation | Design and Technical Guidelines SECTION 3: TECHNICAL GUIDELINES92 Ensure there is no water accumulation or icing on sidewalks or any other areas used by the Occupants, particularly at entrance areas. Concrete sidewalks and paving to be constructed, reinforced and finished to comply with the Barrier Free Design Guidelines. Slope paving to drain minimum 2%. Provide expansion and contraction joints to suit and at junction of paving and building. MATERIALS Building mat erials on walls adjacent active outdoor areas, and those used for hard landscaping, should not be shiny or finished in bright, reflective colours. MAINTENANCE A fully fenced exterior garbage area is to be located in an area convenient for pick-up, as well as for Occupant drop- off. Locate a building's mechanical exhaust vents such that they do not exhaust into active use outdoor areas. Mechanical and electrical equipment should not be located where equipment noise or vibration impacts such areas. A bicycle rack should be included in all projects for staff and/or Occupants. PLANTING Planting is to be provided as required by municipality and plant selections should be colorful and diverse, with seasonal color and variety of textures. In Alberta's winter environment, planting is to be selected to winter conditions. As noted, a sensory garden that uses fragrant plants and attracts butterflies and birds may be provided. Do not select planting that can penetrate sewer lines or foundations. LIGHTING Lighting should adequately illuminate walkways, parking areas, amenity spaces, and building entrances, as well as way-finding signage. Lighting should be designed such that it does not create glare and so that light does not fall past the project's property line. For this, use soffits or down lighting that is International Dark Sky Association compliant in order to minimize light pollution. PARKING The parking strategy is to be in compliance with the local bylaw requirements. In addition to these requirements, parking on all projects requires: Traffic circulation patterns and location of parking designed to promote pedestrian movement and safety. Drop off area/loop at main entrance provided where applicable (not single family or multi-unit). Low maintenance landscaping provided within surface parking areas. Parking for electric vehicles is valuable for many projects. Bicycle parking provided as required by the municipality; ensure it are secure and visible for Occupants, staff and short-term visitors. This area is preferred to be sheltered. Parking areas should be secure and well-lit, while light pollution should be minimized and compliant with the International Dark Sky Association standards. Cross-functional usage of parking areas should be explored to provide for additional outdoor amenity space (when allowed by the municipality). Location of parking ramps for underground parking should not interfere with building or unit entrances, or any indoor or outdoor amenity space (noise, fumes, visual character, etc.). Seniors' projects: Provide surface parking in close proximity to the building entrance. Seniors' projects: Consider providing a canopy over the drop off area for sheltered route to the main entrance. 3.5.2 Requirements For : Seniors' Lodge Seniors' Lodge with Supportive Living Independent Living Landscape and site requirements will differ widely depending on building(s) configurations, the type of site, and its opportunities and restrictions, as well as the anticipated activities of Occupants. Alberta Social Housing Corporation | Design and Technical Guidelines 93 SECTION 3: TECHNICAL GUIDELINESACCESS TO THE OUTDOORS Provide easy access to outdoor spaces. Outdoor spaces should be enjoyed by the Occupants as part of everyday active and healthy living. To encourage Occupant access and facilitate staff supervision, outdoor spaces should also be located to allow for optimal visibility from within the building. Integrate easily opened doors and minimal door thresholds. Accessible Design Throughout the Site All exterior areas intended for Occupant use should be universally accessible. Eliminate any potential tripping hazards and avoid steep slopes, steps or indentations (e.g. ditches) beside paths. Paths and walkways should be wide enough to accommodate two wheelchairs, or two Occupants with walkers, side by side. Changes in elevation on travel paths should be by ramps. Ramps wider than 1.1 m should be provided with handrails. Patios should be constructed to be level throughout. Rough surfaces, such as brick pavers, on any walking area should be avoided as they may cause tripping and impede wheelchair use. Control joints on concrete sidewalks and patios should be saw-cut, not troweled, to eliminate a potential tripping hazard. VARIETY OF OUTDOOR SPACES Where possible, provide a variety of outdoor spaces for passive and active enjoyment of the Occupants, and include hard surface areas, patios and terraces, continuous walkways (loops) through soft landscaping, and Occupant gardens, as well as areas for exercise.

Consider providing moveable seating that allows for wheelchairs and flexible arrangement of seating. Provide outdoor tables. Provide a shaded area (i.e. gazebo), sunny area, and a covered area providing shelter from the weather. Where possible, provide views from seating areas (e.g. to activity space, gardening area or to street life). GARDENING AND OTHER ACTIVITIES Different kinds of activities should be located in close proximity to gathering areas so people can observe the action and comment on it and develop a desire to participate. Consider providing a gardening area for the Occupants made from raised planters in various heights that can facilitate gardening for Occupants in a wheelchair, or those with restricted movement. Provide outdoor exercise areas, such as an area for yoga or tai chi, a small putting ranch, and possible outdoor exercise equipment or ping-pong tables, matching the level of activity of the Occupants. Provide a BBQ area. An outdoor smoking area may be designated, if required; review municipal requirements for the minimum distance from adjacent doors, operable windows, and intake louvers. CIRCULATION PATHS Provide continuous walkways/circulation paths throughout the site that loop back to the entrances and avoid dead ends. Seating should be available along the path for Occupants to take breaks. MAIN ENTRANCE The main entrance should be a covered seating area. This area should be in close proximity to the main entrance and the drop off area should be large enough to accommodate an ambulance. Where possible, provide a canopy that covers the ambulance area.Alberta Social Housing Corporation | Design and Technical Guidelines SECTION 3: TECHNICAL GUIDELINES94 Provide a smooth connection for walking, scooters and wheelchairs from the building entrance to the public sidewalk and drop off area, where applicable. SIGNAGE AND WAY-FINDING Way-finding should be simple and interesting through the use of illustrations or objects (rather than the written word), where appropriate. Exterior signage should have enough height clearance from snow. MAINTENANCE Strategically locate fully fenced exterior garbage area. A wood clad fence may be acceptable, as long as the gate is built to not sag and the local zoning bylaws are in agreement. An area or shed for storage of ground maintenance equipment, gardening tools, and outdoor furniture should be provided. Where Occupants use powered scooters, consideration should be given to an area for scooter parking and recharging. FENCING Fencing should evoke a home-like feeling and not be institutional in nature. Wood or clad-metal fences should be used. Chain-link fences should not be used. 3.5.3 Additional Guidelines for Facilities with Occupants in Memory Care SUPERVISION Supervision of Occupants in Memory Care is important. The building and landscaping design must be coordinated to allow for easy supervision by staff, while not being intrusive for the Occupant. Outdoor areas should be located for easy visibility from staff room. The project's security strategy should provide IT features so that they blend into the environment. (Reference SL4D - Continuing Care Design Guidelines)3.5.4 Requirements For : Multi-Unit Residence Apartment Permanent Supportive Living OPEN SPACES Open spaces should contribute to the sense of a strong neighborhood and complement a distinct sense of place (genius loci) and the local neighborhood signature.
