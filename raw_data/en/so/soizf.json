Once upon a time, herbal medicine was only given in teas. Today, herbal medicine is available in many different forms. The following are the most commonly used: Standardized Extracts Most commonly used because of their convenience, standardized extracts are simply herbs in a pill (capsule or tablet) form. They are highly concentrated and better researched for their active compounds. They can be prepared as a single herb or in combination with other herbs to make a specific formula. Because of their convenience, we usually uses herbs in a pill form. Herbal Tinctures Tinctures are extracts of medicinal plants in alcohol or glycerin. They also can be found as single herbs or in combination with other herbs. We find herbal tinctures to be most useful when very high doses of herbs are needed, when the herbs are not available in pill form, or for people with malabsorption (digestive) issues. Teas Teas are the traditional way herbs have been taken for generations. A cup of tea is a great way to relax no matter what herbs are used. [Dr. Kimberly Brown ND](https://sanjoseintegrativemedicine.com/kimberly-brown) does not usually prescribe teas because they are less potent than tinctures or standardized extracts. Since they are not as strong, teas are very safe. For instance, chamomile may cause miscarriage and decrease estrogen but you will not find a warning on chamomile tea boxes nor does chamomile tea increase hot flashes! Other Herbal Forms Herbs can be applied topically in the form of lotions (liniments), ointments (salves), and poultices. Topical herbs are used for infections, pain, and dry skin. Herbs can be found in lozenges, which are used for sore throats. In addition, they can be found in liquid and powder form making them easier to ingest. And for the kids, there are always gummies!
