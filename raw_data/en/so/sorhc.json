Use the word DETERMINE to remind you of the Warning Signs. DISEASE Any disease, illness or chronic condition which cause s you to change t he way you eat, or makes it hard for you to eat, puts your nutritional health at risk. Four out of five adults have chronic diseases that are affected by diet. Confusion or memory loss that keeps getting worse is estimated to affect one ou t of five or more of older adults. This can make it hard to remember what, when or if you've eaten. Feeling sad or depressed, which happens to abo ut one in eight older adults, c an cause big changes in appetite, digestion, ener gy level, weight and well -being. EATING POORL Y Eating too little and eating too much both lead to poor health. Eating the same foods day after day or not eating fruit, veget ables, and milk products daily will also cause poor nutritional health. One in f ive adults skip meals daily. O nly 13% of adults eat the minimum amount of fruit and vegetables needed. One in four older adults drink too much alcohol. Many health problems become worse if you drink more tha n one or two alcoholic beverages per day. TOOTH LOSS/ MOUTH P AIN A healthy mou th, teeth and gum s are needed to eat. Missing, loose or rotten teeth or dentures which don't fit well, or cause mouth sores, make it hard to eat. ECONOMIC HARDSHIP As many as 40% of older Americans have incomes of less than $6,000 per year. Having less -- or choosing to spend less -- than $25 -30 per week for food makes it very hard to get the foods you need to stay healthy. REDUCED SOCIAL CONTACT One-third of all older peop le live alone. Being with people daily has a posi tive effect on morale, well -being and eating. MUL TIPLE MEDICINES Many older Americans must take medicines for health problems. Almost half of older Americans take multiple medicines daily. G rowing old may change the way we respond to drugs. The more med icines you take, the greater t he chance for sid e effects such as increased or decreased appetite, change in taste, constipation, weakness, drowsiness, diarrhea, nausea, and others. Vitamins or minerals, when taken in large doses, act like drugs and can cau se harm. Alert your doctor to everything you ta ke. INVOLUNTARY WEIGHT LOSS/GAIN Losing or gaining a lot of weight when you are not trying to do so is an important warning sign that must not be ignored. Be ing overweight or underweight also increases your chance of poor health. NEED S ASSISTANCE IN S ELF CARE Although most older people are able to eat, one of every five have trouble walking, shopping, buying and cooking food, especi ally as they get older. ELDER YEARS ABOVE AGE 80 Most older people lead full and productive lives. Bu t as age increase s, risk of frailty and health problems increase. Checking your nutritional health regularly makes good sense. 16 Attachme nt E Home -Delivered Nutrition /Nutrition Intervention OAAPS Collection Per 7. 39 of the Service Standards, Home Delivered Nutrition providers will supply the OAAPS Reporting Templa te (FORM CF -049) for both Home Delivered Nutrition and Nutrition Intervention service (thus 2 separate reports must be generated for the Home Delivered Nutrition serv ice contract).
