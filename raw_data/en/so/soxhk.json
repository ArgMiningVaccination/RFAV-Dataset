As a result, when we violate those basic laws or determinants of health, we see a cascade of health issues, such as autoimmune diseases, fatigue, chronic pain, diabetes, and everything in between. Schedule a consultation to see how we can start your healing process today by calling My Natural Health Center at [(630) 488-2376](tel:630-488-2376). Naturopathic Medicine is the practice of internal medicine using natural resources to stimulate and support the body's inherent ability to heal. Naturopathic treatments are based on science and \"evidence-based practices.\" Treatments seek to identify root causes of illness, address imbalances as naturally and gently as possible, and teach patients how to create wellness and prevent illness whenever possible. Naturopathy is a drug-free, safe, and effective system of medicine that is based on what we refer to as \"The Determinants of Health\". Those determinants are discussed and evaluated as part of the New Patient Intake. These include: diet, hydration, sleep/rest, exercise, breath/oxygen, stress management, etc. When the body's systems are brought back into alignment via the Naturopathic Therapeutic Order, healing occurs, and health is optimized.
