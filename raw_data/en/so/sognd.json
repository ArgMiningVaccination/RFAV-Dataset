Spring 2017 l Page 4 DC Board of Chiropractic BOArd Of ChIrOprACTIC exeCuTIve dIreCTOr's COLuMn By Frank B. Meyers, JD, Executive Director DC Board of Chiropractic Introduction With a new year comes new changes and the DC Board of Chiropractic is no exception. The past year has brought with it licensure renewals, a new workforce survey, new regulations and even new staff. The Board is focused on making sure that 2017 will continue to bring positive change to both its licensees and to the District's residents it's sworn to protect. renewals Beginning in October of 2016, the Board began accepting applications from DC licensed chiropractors for renewal of their licenses. This process continued until December 31, 2016, at which point any license that was not renewed became expired. We are happy to report the Board had a nearly 100% renewal rate for the 2017-2018 renewal cycle. These new licenses will be valid until December 31, 2018. As the next expiration date approaches, the Board will send out renewal reminders to the address of record on file for each licensee. This reminder will include information on how to renew your license, as well as how to contact us with any questions regarding your renewal. If your address changes at any point between now and the next renewal cycle, you are required to provide your new address to the Board. This allows the Board to maintain active communication with its licensees, including providing up to date information on the legal requirements for practicing chiropractic within the District of Columbia. workforce survey As part of the recent renewal cycle, licensees were also asked to complete a Workforce Survey. The responses each of you submitted will be used in compiling the next Workforce Capacity Report, which is utilized by both the Board and other governmental agencies in addressing various issues regarding the chiropractic workforce. This includes identifying areas of provider shortage, common issues of concern in providing chiropractic care, and even identifying changing methods to the scope of chiropractic practice. You can find a copy of the 2014 Workforce Capacity Report online at http://doh.dc.gov/node/901812. As for the most recent survey, the Board hopes to have the Workforce Report compiled and published before the end of the year. Shortly thereafter, the Board will also put on a symposium to discuss the issues identified and obtain input on ways to solve those issues. Keep an eye out in the near future for more information regarding the next Workforce Capacity Report, as well as the next Board of Chiropractic Symposium. Conclusion I want to thank the wonderful staff and members of the Board for the excellent work they do. Without the hard work and dedication of these amazing people, the Board would not be able to fulfill its purpose of patient protection. The Board is always looking for talented people to assist in its mission, whether that be providing feedback on regulations, participating in workgroups, or just providing information on topics of interest. If you or someone you know is interested in helping the Board, you can have them reach out to us via email at dcboc@dc.gov . Here's to an exciting and positive 2017! Sincerely, Frank B.

It set forth rule amendments regarding educational requirements, licensure requirements, examination, continuing education requirements, standards of conduct, and scope of practice.

Specifically, the rule amendments will: Change the description of one of the areas of the District examination for licensure from \"Medical ethics\" to \" ethics and boundaries \"; Require applicants for licensure who fail to obtain a score of at least 75% on two successive District examinations to appear before the Board before being permitted to retake the examination a third time; Allow applicants for licensure awaiting examination to practice under the direct supervision of a District licensed chiropractor for a period not to exceed six (6) months unless extended at the discretion of the Board; Increase the number of continuing education credit hours from the current requirement of twenty-four (24) hours to the new requirement of thirty (30) hours beginning with the 2017- 2018 license cycle, which shall include three (3) hours in communicable disease (including HIV-AIDS), two (2) hours in cultural competence and appropriate clinical treatment specifically for individuals who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, gender nonconforming, queer, or questioning their sexual orientation or gender identity and expression, and five (5) hours in any combination of ethics, risk management, documentation and record keeping, or cultural competency; Increase the number of continuing education credit hours from the current requirement of twelve (12) hours to the new requirement of fifteen (15) hours for an applicant in inactive status who submits an application to reactivate a license;Increase the number of continuing education credit hours from the current requirement of twelve (12) hours to the new requirement of fifteen (15) hours for an applicant for reinstatement of a license; Add the federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards providers of Approved Continuing education (pACe) program as an entity the Board shall accept for accrediting continuing education programs; Prohibit advertising and marketing that is false, misleading, or deceptive or contravenes professional ethics or does not conform to the prevailing standards of acceptable chiropractic practice; Require that only information that is accurate and truthful be used when describing a chiropractor's professional education, qualifications, titles, or other professional information generally relied upon by the public; Allow for chiropractors licensed in other states but not in the District to participate in a clinic or event in the District under certain conditions; and Allow students enrolled at approved chiropractic colleges to work in a chiropractic office under the direct supervision of a preceptor or Board- approved licensed practitioner, giving the students an opportunity to obtain practical experience in addition to their classroom education. Over the course of the next year, the Board will continue to update its laws and rules to bring the district up to date with current standards and best practices in the chiropractic profession.

The District of Columbia Board of Chiropractic received the 2015 pennebaker/ wiley Outstanding Chiropractic Licensing Board Award at the Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards' (FCLB) 89th Annual Convention in New Orleans, in May 2016. The award recognizes an FCLB member board which has exemplified standards of excellence, serving as a model for every chiropractic licensing board . \"The recipient of the award should have done something difficult, whether in terms of legislation, internal restructuring, political positions, development of educational materials, or other areas outside the mainstream of everyday operations.\" BOArd reCeIves AwArdThe Distric t of Columbia Board of Chiropractic (BOC), a division within the DC Department of Health, Health Regulation and Licensing Administration (HRLA), has the responsibility to regulate the practice of chiropractic medicine in the District of Columbia. Its mission is to serve and protect the public and ensure high standards of chiropractic care and professionalism through best-practices in regulation, education and outreach. Regulation is achieved through the application process, the disciplinary process and outreach/ educational activities.Spring 2017 l Page 8 DC Board of Chiropractic Meet neW BoarD of CHiroPra CtiC MeMBer, JuStin M.

Klein, DC\"We live in an extremely educated metropolitan area and I believe it is for these reasons that we should really continue to push to educate the medical community about what we do so that we can continue to build bridges between us, rather than continue to misinterpret and misrepresent by remaining uninformed. And that goes for all of us. \" profession, raise standards and protect the public. I believe that this is a time where we really need to educate the general public about our profession, as well as the health and medical communities. With respect to the plethora of research supporting non-invasive and conservative treatment protocols, I believe it is important that we as chiropractors begin to be seen as \"health managers,\" rather than \"pain managers,\" because we as a profession have an opportunity to improve our entire American health care system by improving the perception of ourselves. what unique perspective do you bring to the Board? (Tell us about your career.) I am a Washingtonian, born and raised, and a three-sport athlete growing up (baseball, soccer, wrestling). As a consistent leadoff batter and captain of the wrestling team, my experiences in athletics created my desire to improve, especially with (personal) human performance. I attended the University of Maryland, College Park, earning a BS degree in Kinesiology, after two years of Pre-Med. I was also the president of my fraternity and member of the InterFraternity Council (IFC) Board. I graduated cum laude from the University of Bridgeport, College of Chiropractic, having served as president of the Student Government for two years and was an active Student American Chiropractic Association (SACA) member as well. I've travelled the world in search of knowledge of neurodevelopmental education, healing techniques, movement and body language, and earned a lot of tough love while travelling on my own, meeting all kinds of new people along the way. I began my career in Silver Spring, MD in 2008, and began my own practice in Spring Valley, NW, DC in the summer of 2010, Got Your Back Chiropractic, now known as Got Your Back Total Health. Over the past seven years, my office has grown from 500 square feet with no windows, to over 3,000 square feet of total health and happiness care, with windows all over and floor space to move to your heart's delight. I now have a team of six friendly and passionate staff, all certified assistants and coaches, and are helpful on the floor as we work on restorative movement with our patients. As a clinician, we focus on the whole patient as an individual powered by their nervous system, and our system is unique in that it combines two structurally restorative techniques. We believe an educated patient will make better healthy changes for themselves, creating better healthy habits, and ultimately becoming more sustainable, healthy individuals. Structural restorative/corrective care, including techniques like Chiropractic BioPhysics practices, special adjustments and traction to strive towards ideal curvatures of the spine, similar to orthodontics of the spine without the use of \"braces.\" We combine our structural chiropractic technique with an education on \"physically therapeutic\" movement systems, designed specifically to teach each individual sustainable healthy practices. We love to help our patients rediscover their Original Strength(tm) and build a healthy MoveMentality(tm)...and keep getting healthier and happier along the way! when were you appointed to the Board? I was officially appointed to the Board on December 15, 2016. why and how did you get involved with the Board? what sparked your interest in serving as a Board member? True story. I visited the Board for a meeting last year and in that meeting there was a guest attending to explain and discuss the SEED Initiative in DC, which was not designed at the time (and still may not be) to include chiropractic services. I had plenty to say about my perspective on the matter and to know that this health care project was only to include medical interventions, because I believe that an overwhelming amount of research in the literature only gives more reason to include preventative and proactive health management like the services chiropractors provide. After that meeting I was asked if I would like to join the Board and I'm excited to have the opportunity to have my voice heard now in the DC Board of Chiropractic. Is there any aspect of your service as a Board member, thus far, that has surprised you (or has the experience been what you expected it to be)? Well, I've only just begun, but it is encouraging to know that now as an active member I am able to propose positive changes that I believe can better the chiropractic Spring 2017 l Page 9 DC Board of Chiropractic We've just begun our newest project, the Got Your Back Foundation, 501(c)(3), and our mission is to level the playing field, creating better access to complementary and alternative health care as well as providing initiatives to bring all of our complementary and alternative health care systems to those who need it, can't afford it, and/or don't have access to it. We aim to create programs that will bring movement, nutrition, chiropractic, rehabilitation, health, wellness and fitness education, jobs and collaborations to those who need it, want it and deserve it, and we are super excited to be starting our programs by Spring 2017! what issues, related to the regulation of Chiropractic, interest you most? I'm interested in learning as much as I can at the moment because I haven't really had an opportunity to learn all of the possibilities yet. With respect to regulations that I think could help ensure quality care, I believe we should have a minimum education level for Chiropractic Assistants because it's important to have the right basic knowledge when handling patients with care. what knowledge or skills have you developed as a Board member that you had not developed before? Since I've only just begun my journey as a Board member on the DC Board of Chiropractic, I would have to say that I am excited for all of the knowledge and skills that I look forward to developing in my tenure. I love networking as well and I'm looking forward to continuing to build bridges with like-minded perspective doctors who want to continue to educate the people. It's been a while since I've been able to get away from my practice, so it will be really nice to travel and meet more members of Chiropractic Boards around the country. Is there anything about the district or the dC population that poses a unique challenge regarding the regulation of chiropractic practice? Chiropractic has a unique challenge in itself to create a healthy sense of awareness of the services and products we provide to our communities. As Doctors of Chiropractic, we all need to get on the same page with respect to our scopes of practice, regulations and specifications certainly can and will help to improve our standing as health care providers. As we know, there is a wide variety of chiropractic treatments, protocols, services, practitioners, philosophies, etc. I believe that one of our greatest challenges has been the split between ourselves, and, in time, we need to reestablish ourselves as \"health managers\" rather than \"pain managers,\" as we are the doctors (educators) who enjoy seeing our patients get well, stay well and manage the healing process. We live in an extremely educated metropolitan area and I believe it is for these reasons that we should really continue to push to educate the medical community about what we do so that we can continue to build bridges between us, rather than continue to misinterpret and misrepresent by remaining uninformed. And that goes for all of us. In recent years, what do you feel is the greatest accomplishment of the Board? I'm not sure of all the most recent accomplishments, but I feel that one of the greatest accomplishments that I am aware of is that we have more than doubled the number of Doctors of Chiropractic in the District now compared to when I moved back to the DC area in 2008. I believe we were under 50 DC's in DC then and now we are at or around 100 active DC's. That is so GREAT because we have more voices to be heard!!! what challenges do you anticipate that the Board might face in the future? One big challenge, as I've mentioned, is going to be bridging the gap between Chiropractic, Medicine and our communities. I never imagine any change happens easily, and it all comes down to perspective and appreciation if we're being proactive. Just as we deal with our patients on a daily basis, pain says a lot. And change can be painful if we allow it to be or if we allow problems to get too big before doing something about it. That's how I see this unknown territory right now. If we're proactive, thinking outside the box, opening our minds to the possibilities rather than the objections (yet keeping those struggles in mind), we can make anything happen. So, in other words, \"Challenge Accepted.\" what would you tell someone who is thinking about applying to serve on the Board? I would say that we could use all the help we can get! As I've mentioned, I'm brand new to the Board and I'm excited to be able to have a voice in our system now. It would be great to have more doctors serve with us to help give us more perspective on possible improvements we can make. Any message you would like to convey to new licensees? I'm looking forward to meeting you!!!

For most professions, each board needs to recommend for each occupation whether the LGBTQ CE requirement is included in existing CE hour requirements or in addition to existing CE hour requirements. 4. For a health occupation without existing CE requirements, the rules must establish the CE program for at least the LGBTQ CE requirement based on the relevant board's recommendation. More CEs can be established. 5. Rules need to specify subspecialties considered to be exempt under the statutory provision for a rule waiver as they \"do not see patients in a clinical setting\". For example, radiologists, pathologists, administrative doctors. see dC Law 21-95, LGBTQ Cultural Competency Continuing education Amendment Act of 2016 at: http://lims.dccouncil.us/download/33671/B21-0168-signedAct.pdf)During the discussion, panelists noted considerations health care providers should keep in mind regarding LGBTQ patients: LGBTQ persons have historically been a marginalized population. It is only recently that homosexuality and gender identity issues have not been labelled psychological disorders. 74% of LGBTQ individuals were subjected to bullying, harassment, or discrimination during the K-12 years. LGBTQ persons may be isolated , as they are less likely to have the support of family and community. LGBTQ persons have a higher suicide rate and higher rate of Sexually Transmitted Disease and homelessness. Ask new patients about possible use of alcohol/recreational drugs . Ask if patients have a history using anti-HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep) , hormones or puberty blockers. Use inclusive language on intake forms. If your intake interview is the same for all, consider reframing what you are asking to ensure inclusivity. Your questions about members of the household should be inclusive. If you traditionally ask \"What is your wife's/husband's name?,\" ask for the name of the \"husband, wife or long-term partner.\" If you would like to initiate a discussion about identity or gender, make room for \"other\" on the form\u2014with space for the patient to explain their situation. An open form gives the patient permission to talk about themselves and their experiences. One ice breaker question on the intake form could be \"Do you consider yourself to be a part of the LGBTQ community?\" If a patient indicates that they are \"trans,\" ask them what that designation means to them. Different people may use this term in different ways. If you are not sure which pronoun to use, ask the patient which they prefer. Be affirming\u2014through your actions, the format of your intake forms, and through the pictures on your website . Engage in outreach; obtain a vendor table at LBGTQ community events. LGBTQ issues are human issues. LGBT patients have jobs and families. (Cultural Competency continued) ThAnKs TO Our heALTh LICensInG speCIALIsTs!
