We are all Internet Marketers, recently organized as an online author's cooperative to create niche products and to share our knowledge with each other as we navigate the online learning process. We hope you enjoy the information in our first book. 4 THE Aromatherapy Handbook Like acupuncture, aromatherapy has been in use for more than 6,000 years. Its origins aren't completely documented, but there is enough evidence to assemble a decent time line in the history of therapeutic uses of aromatic essences. It's possible that it all began in Australia with the aborigines over 40,000 years ago, but they weren't known for keeping records. Much of their history was passed along verbally from generation to generation, much like that of the native tribes on all continents, including the native North American Indians, whose history also is rich with the use of fragrant oils for religious and therapeutic purposes. But the Egyptians, with their use of stone tablets inscribed with stories of their culture, are generally credited with being the first to establish the use of aromatic oils. Later, the Greeks learned from the Egyptians, and still later, the Romans learned from the Greeks. Concurrently, fragrant oils and plant essences were being developed in ancient China. The oldest surviving medical book in China, Shen Nung's Herbal Book, dates back to about 2700 B.C. and catalogs more than 300 plants and their uses. By the 16 th century, and hundreds of books later, the Chinese Materia Medica Pen Ts'ao contains information on almost 2,000 herbs and 20 essential oils. Many of the uses of these oils eventually depended upon the discovery of the distillation process, as well as the types of plants present in each location. While the technology of distillation is credited to the Egyptians, it's possible it was concurrently discovered in China, Turkey and Persia. The traditional practice of medicine in India, known as Ayurveda, practiced for more than 3,000 years, also utilized essential oils by the use of therapeutic massage. As trade routes developed across the globe, the different essences could be transported to countries that couldn't grow the plants to produce them. This, of course, added to their value, and in most instances, made them the currency of the day, as they became more valuable than gold. Numerous passages in the Bible point to the value of oils, spices and herbs, in fact. The most well known cite might be that of the Three Wise Men who brought gold, frankincense and myrrh to the infant Christ in Bethlehem. Some historians have even questioned whether the \"gold\" mentioned was, in fact, metallic gold, as it could have been ambergris, a golden oil that was of such high value, it outclassed gold itself and often was referred to as \"gold\" at that time. Mary Magdelene was criticized in another passage, by Judas Iscariot, for anointing the feet of Christ, possibly because she was \"wasting\" an oil called spikenard, considered extremely valuable at the time. Indeed, the name \"Christ,\" or Christos, is Greek for \"anointed.\" By the first century A.D., the uses for fragrances included religion, health, beauty, \"hygiene\" and entertainment. It is said that the Roman Emperor Nero used scents extravagantly at his palace parties, with carved ivory ceiling and wall panels outfitted to sprinkle or mist his guests with rose petals and floral waters. Hygiene in those days consisted of bathing in perfume or slathering one's body with fragrant oils. Much later, even Queen Elizabeth I is said to have used such fragrances in her annual bath, \"whether she needed it or no.\" Perfumers, called unguentarii, lined the streets of ancient Rome and prescribed the use of different aromatics for specific ills. Placebo effect nothwithstanding, their formulations must have worked, because they were regarded as highly as doctors. While it may have been the Egyptians who mainstreamed the uses of fragrances and essences, other cultures were by then using them also, developing their own processes. India became well known for their spices, herbs and oils, for example, and trading with them became highly competitive and profitable, giving India a significant boost in their economy at the time. Anyone who has studied American history should remember the stories of the Dutch East India company, who had somewhat of a monopoly on such trades. It was this situation that prompted Christopher Columbus to seek a shorter route to the Orient in order to circumvent the expensive stranglehold they had on the world's trade in spices and oils. The rest is history, as they say, since Columbus did not reach the Orient after all. (An unknown, surprise continent got in the way!) Further, he was not able to find the same plant life as that which he sought. However, he found others that did become profitable and made the trip worthwhile, including juniper, cedar, sassafras, vanilla and other floral fragrances. While ancient history is full of fascinating stories of aromatic oils and essences and their uses, it wasn't until more recent times that aromatherapy began to be touched by the scientific world. As civilization evolved and learning advanced at a faster and faster pace, the concept of science was born and the learned, educated members of society embarked on research, utilizing experimentation and observation to reach conclusions and to catalog knowledge. Since aromatic oils were such an important part of life throughout the history of human existence, it was only logical to pursue that area and continue the advancement of such knowledge. Moving ahead to our \"modern world,\" then, two major changes took place in the late 19 th century. First, the use of fragrances split into two camps: perfumery and cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. Second, and unfortunately, as with the field of nutrition, essential oils suffered a huge setback in understanding as well as acceptance and use, due to the discovery of the ability to formulate synthetic copies of almost any chemical. A replicated molecule of a vitamin is not the vitamin. Similarly, a copy of a plant oil is not that plant's essence. No longer, then, could perfumes be used medicinally. 6 THE Aromatherapy Handbook Synthetic copies are mere shadows of the original and usually are weaker and ineffective, or worse, they can be toxic. Sadly, such a reputation is given to the authentic version by the modern medical community and is cast as ineffective and inferior to accepted medical formulations, or, drugs. Ironically, however, many of today's drugs were originally derived from plant sources. It wasn't until the 20 th century that aromatherapy began its reentry into the world of therapeutics. In 1928 (some authorities cite 1930, others say it was as late as 1937), the term \"aromatherapy\" was coined by French chemist Rene Maurice Gattefoss. His interest is reputed to have begun when he burned himself in a laboratory explosion at the family perfumery and he reflexively plunged his arm into a handy vat of lavender oil for relief. Later, he was so amazed at his painless recovery, with no scarring, that he pursued further experiments with the oil. In the 1960s, French doctor Jean Valnet and biochemist Madame Maury, who both knew of Gattefoss's work, furthered the future of aromatherapy with their own investigations. Dr. Valnet had successfully used essential oils in the treatment of burns and wounds during World War II, along with various fragrances in the treatment of psychiatric problems. He wrote a book, titled Aromatherapies, which was translated into English and titled The Practice of Aromatherapy, and which is still a popular and well-respected volume today. Maury developed specific massage techniques for best delivery of such oils and opened clinics across Europe for the practice of her new techniques. She and Micheline Arcier developed methods that are still in use today. But it was Englishman Robert Tisserand's book, The Art of Aromatherapy, published in 1977, that captured the interest of the American market. Aromatherapy was ultimately introduced in America in the 1980s in California, where it was embraced by health food outlets and alternative health practitioners. 7 THE Aromatherapy Handbook A note about disclaimers in this book For those who might think that smelling fragrances is harmless and incapable of being therapeutic, please note the disclaimers provided throughout this ebook, as stated by reputable aromatherapy practitioners, suppliers and educators. The oils derived from plants and used for therapeutic purposes can have astonishing, as well as devastating, effects, though most results occupy a wide spectrum somewhere between these extremes. There even is a movement to create licensing and standards for aromatherapy practitioners because a proper education in the use of these oils is essential to protect users and those who dispense and recommend them. A major player in that movement is Jeanne Rose, past president of the National Association for Holistic Aromatherapy, who believes that the practice of aromatherapy requires knowledge of chemistry, physiology and botany. Nowadays, aromatherapy most often is found within the purview of massage therapists as well as alternative health disciplines. Its modern use derives from methods developed in the 1950s by Marguerite (Margaret) Maury, a French biochemist, and an associate, Micheline Arcier (or Archer), who collaborated with Maury as she established clinics in Europe for the use of oils as treatment for specific ailments. Much research was done in Europe before aromatherapy was brought to America. 8 THE Aromatherapy Handbook You've probably noticed that when we humans cut ourselves a red fluid (blood) oozes out! No great news there. Similarly, when you break or injure the parts of plants they\"bleed,\" too. Unlike blood, this fluid is clear. It is, in fact, an oil or resin and within it can be found trace elements of nutrients, hormones, enzymes, vitamins, minerals and anti-bodies. It has a whole range of different properties such as anti-fungal, anti-bacterial, anti- infectious, antiseptic and can stimulate the immune system as well. Oxygen is also found in this resin, bound chemically within other molecules such as alcohols, phenols, esters and many other organic molecules, which together make up the essential oil. This oil is released by the plant to clean the wound, kill the bacteria and start the regeneration or healing process, and in fact has the same function as blood in humans (and other animals). Like blood, this fluid/oil in plants transports the basic nutrients necessary to feed and support the cells. What's more, the essential oil has the ability to permeate or penetrate the plant's cell walls and transport oxygen and nutrients into the cells themselves to support and help their immune system. Research has shown that, because of these immune stimulating properties, essential oils can support the immune system. So that, for instance, whether applied topically (rubbed on) or inhaled, 70% of people who get a cold or flu will recover faster using essential oils! Essential oils have many special properties which give them the ability to help us deal with odors and bacteria. They act in several ways. 1. They are able to increase atmospheric oxygen in a closed space as they release oxygenating molecules into the atmosphere. Oils increase ozone and negative ions in the home, which inhibits the growth of bacteria. This prevents and destroys existing odors of cigarettes, mold, animals, etc. 2. They are able to break up the molecular chains of some chemicals in the air, making them non-toxic to us because of their particular electromagnetic attraction to these chemicals. 3. Essential Oils will bond to metals and chemicals within the body and carry them out of the body, working as natural chelators (they bond organically, forming new compounds called chelates), so that these toxic substances can't remain in the tissues. 4. Essential Oils remove dust particles from the air, acting as an air filtration system. 5. Essential Oils are recognized as having a very marked ability to increase cellular oxygen through their normal functioning. When applied to the body by rubbing the feet, they will travel through the body and affect every cell, including the hair, within 20 minutes! In orthodox medicine, one compound, such as aspirin, is made and its properties are tested and known. However, in nature, in each essential oil, there can be many, many different compounds, all with different therapeutic effects. They act synergistically to give the body what it needs. Sometimes it can have opposing effects so it can act as a relaxant or stimulant depending on what's needed. Each essential oil contains as many as 100 chemical components, which together exert a strong effect on the whole person. Depending on which component is predominating in an oil, it acts differently. For example, some oils are relaxing, some soothe, some relieve pain, etc. Then there are oils such as lemon and lavender, which adapt to what the body needs, and adapt to that situation. (These are called \"adaptogenic.\") The mechanism in which these essential oils act on us is not very well understood. What is understood is that they affect our mind and emotions. They leave no harmful residues. They enter into the body either by absorption (by rubbing them on the skin) or inhalation. Because Essential Oils are volatile, i.e., they convert into a vapor, they stimulate the powerful sense of smell. It is known that the odors we smell have a great impact on how we feel. In fact, it has been shown that people who have no sense of smell have a higher incidence of psychiatric problems such as anxiety and depression. 10 THE Aromatherapy Handbook We are able to distinguish between 10,000 different smells! The fine oil particles enter through the nose via cilia (the fine hairs lining the nose) and are absorbed into the blood stream in the lungs. Once they have entered the bloodstream, they change the electrical conductivity and pH right at the spot of entry at the capillary and causes an electrical charge to travel through the body, which explains why it can have such a fast effect sometimes. One of the major systems affected is the limbic system, the part of the brain that controls our moods, emotions, memory and learning. There has been research done measuring changes in brain frequency with the use of different essential oil fragrances. For instance, studies with lavender have shown that the alpha brain waves, which are associated with relaxation, increase. On the other hand, studies with jasmine have shown a marked increase of beta waves, which represents alertness! So clearly, different essential oils have different effects. There are many different essential oils, in fact, as many different oils as there are plants. They are very complex substances containing sometimes up to 100 chemical components which have many different effects, some of which even depend on what the body needs. They can act outside the body, e.g., oxygenating the air and removing pollution or they are absorbed into the body via the nose or the skin and can have multiple significant effects on mood, health and general well-being. . 11 THE Aromatherapy Handbook In Summary: On a physical level, essential oils are the most potent form of herbal energy. They are antiseptic and immune system stimulants. They are also effective for daily first-aid, e.g., for bites, itches, coughs and cold. On a cellular level, essential oils are good for healing wounds, repairing scars, stimulating tissue and regulating the barrier (between the inside and outside world). They help maintain optimum moisture level in skin and protect it from infection. Geranium and lavender are examples of oils that work on this cellular level. On an emotional level, they stimulate both conscious and sub conscious memories, basic drives and hormones. They are effective in dealing with depression, grief, low self esteem, improving sleep and stress-related disorders. On an energy level, they can be applied to acupuncture meridian points, chakras and subtle energy points to help healing. On a spiritual or reflective level, essential oils have been used by every major culture and society for over 10,000 years. They have been used for ritual, prayer, purification, magic, mysticism, celebration and meditation. Many people believe that essential oils can bring focus and deeper meaning to our existence. These days the understanding of their properties and appropriate use has been formalized into a health discipline - aromatherapy - and practitioners are now trained to know how to use them effectively for optimum health and well being The mechanism by which essential oils acts is complex and not well understood due to the nature of all the many compounds within each one. Nevertheless, the quality and effect of fragrance or smell, though little understood, is an important part of our human experience and via the many and varied healing properties of essential oils, can enhance our lives and heal our bodies, minds and spirits. 12 THE Aromatherapy Handbook Career Information for a Degree in Aromatherapy Aromatherapy is commonly associated with complementary and alternative medicine, and involves the use of essential oils and aromatic compounds from plants to affect someone's mood or health. Aromatherapy, although around for centuries, has come back in recent years as a popular field of study for many students interested in alternative medicine. Aromatherapy is used for the treatment or prevention of disease, but is regarded by many as more of an art form than a traditional healing science. However, aromatherapy students benefit from their acquired knowledge, and can often learn to use essential oils and natural scents to improve moods, increase energy, or aid in relaxation. While enrolled in an aromatherapy program, students learn to distill essential oils and work with chemicals such as Absolutes, Hydrosols, Infusions, Phytoncides, and Carrier oils. Once an aromatherapy degree or certification is earned, students are qualified to work as any of the following: Aromatherapist According to the National Association of Holistic Aromatherapy, aromatherapy is the art of using naturally extracted essences from plants to promote the health of the body, spirit and mind. Therapy is based on each patient's reaction to different aromatic extracts and relies on the innate healing powers within each person. Aromatherapists work closely with their patients, observing their reactions and providing guidance and counsel throughout the treatment. They must be creative and observant, and able to communicate well with people. Aromatherapists must also have a good nose and be able to distinguish between many different fragrances. This continually growing field has found its way into other therapeutic disciplines such as massage therapy and acupuncture - the use of aromas helps to relax and ease the discomfort of patients as they undergo the therapy. Because of this, career opportunities after receiving an education in Aromatherapy (depending on your other skills) can be widely varied. Opportunities can include: aromatherapeutic counseling participating in a Holistic Health Clinic establishing an Aromatherapy consulting business retailing essential oils becoming an author tutoring schools and interested groups writing articles for newspapers and magazines taking better care of your own and loved ones' health. Aromatherapy Retailer Many people choose to enter retail, as aromatherapy is hot on the market. Whether you open your own boutique selling essential oils and fragrances, or you choose to work as a fragrance specialist for a large manufacturer of aromatherapy products, a degree in aromatherapy will certainly be advantageous. For people planning to go into the retail end of aromatherapy, additional training in business and marketing may be advisable. Because essential oils, bath salts, candles, and other items are enjoying such success on the commercial market, all areas of aromatherapy are expected to grow. 14 THE Aromatherapy Handbook Alternative Health Care Practitioners Alternative health care practitioners provide alternative, or complementary, therapeutic health services to their clients or patients. Alternative health care treats sickness, injury, and other problems with ways that are different from 'Western' medicine. Most practitioners believe they can diagnose, treat, and care for patients relying only on self- healing abilities of the body. These methods tend to be 'holistic' and draw from many disciplines. Holistic medicine includes aromatherapy, nutrition counseling, herbal remedies, acupressure, homeopathy, exercise, psychotherapy, physiotherapy, and life style counseling. Those with a degree in aromatherapy will need more education to perform medicinal treatment, but the degree is a great first step A Diploma or Certificate from an Aromatherapy school is not a national certification and is not a 'license to practice.' Therefore, it is very important not to present yourself as a physician when you begin to practice Aromatherapy. Although some do seek training in Aromatherapy to enhance their current profession and others simply to enjoy better personal health, Aromatherapy-specific career opportunities are growing as complementary medicine becomes a more widely accepted mode of health care. Aromatherapy is a growing industry in the U.S., and there are opportunities available for well-trained, dedicated people. Many schools offer to assist you in finding a place to practice your unique skills after completion of their coursework. A career in Aromatherapy may be for you if you want to practice a subtle, ancient art that can help you educate or heal others through natural methods. A professional approach to your practice is gained from the training you will have received, and with time and experience, your craft and your career will develop. What laws apply to the practice of aromatherapy? At this time, there is no specific regulation of Aromatherapists or Aromatherapy. Many practitioners incorporate it into their practices, such as massage therapy, and the laws governing that practice are the ones that apply. An Aromatherapist with no other medical training or license generally works as a counselor or teacher and should follow whatever regulations apply to that profession in their area. What are the prerequisites for an Aromatherapy training program? The majority of programs are night or weekend seminars and anyone can attend. A few programs are designed specifically for medical practitioners. These generally require 15 THE Aromatherapy Handbook the student to either be enrolled in an appropriate college or to already have a degree/license in their area. These professional Aromatherapy seminars range from courses designed for massage therapists to courses designed for medical doctors. How much does Aromatherapy training cost? Programs average about $500, but may vary from region to region. It is really up to you, the student, to choose the school you feel most comfortable with and to determine whose educational philosophies most attract you. Different schools may focus on different elements of Aromatherapy, and some schools may focus on the study of Aromatherapy in conjunction with other natural health and/or allopathic health disciplines. Many schools offer on-site programs, as well as correspondence programs, and online courses. It is for this reason that it is highly recommended to obtain in depth information about the focus, philosophy, and coursework of various Aromatherapy schools. What is the current situation with Aromatherapy accreditation in the United States? Currently, there is no official form of Aromatherapy accreditation in the U.S. Among professionals in the trade, certainly schools and practitioners who maintain high levels of quality are more widely reputed. Neither Aromatherapy nor essential oils are regulated by any governmental body. Although there is no official accreditation, many schools may offer a diploma or certificate which shows successful completion of their coursework. Aromatherapy is currently governed by several associations: The Educational Standards in Aromatherapy Association in conjunction with the Natural Oils Research Association (NORA) The American Alliance of Aromatherapy The National Association for Holistic Aromatherapy (NAHA) Generally schools and practitioners affiliate with one of these associations. Each of these associations is presently attempting to set educational, certification and accreditation standards in the United States for Aromatherapy education. The accreditation goals of these organizations include: ensuring compliance with educational standards through an examination process ensuring ethical considerations are upheld across the community upholding other professional requirements to obtain and keep certification as an Aromatherapist 16 THE Aromatherapy Handbook These organizations, of course, have many other functions besides the coordination of educational standards. These functions include: serving as a focal and meeting point for members of the professional Aromatherapy community creating guidelines for the safe use of oils serving to improve public awareness of Aromatherapy throughout the U.S. How long does it take to learn Aromatherapy? Since there is currently no official accreditation, the length of coursework varies quite widely from several dozen to several hundred hours to receive a school's individual certification. Different people will certainly progress at different rates when learning Aromatherapy. An Aromatherapist who has been practicing for 10 years may feel knowledgeable in only 60 essential oils. It may take a year or more of practice to really get to know 10 essential oils intimately. Others may progress more rapidly. More may not be better in exposure to the numerous essential oils. Like many of the healing arts, it is suggested that you place emphasis on getting to know your key tools before venturing on to others. Basic levels of instruction may allow you to safely and effectively use essential oils to enhance your quality of life, to enhance the quality of your other care giving practices, or for home use. Basic levels of instruction may answer such questions as: What is Aromatherapy? What are essential oils? How do they work on the body and the mind? How can I safely use them? More advanced levels of study are for those who may want to have a private consultation practice, to work in a clinic, or to combine more in-depth Aromatherapy knowledge into their other natural health and/or allopathic health care practices. Advanced levels of study may allow you to delve into areas such as: production of oils oil chemistry advanced knowledge of effects of oils on the body and mind understanding the link to memory mood and emotion advanced treatment methods and applications the science of blending oils safety and toxicity information additional bio-specificities of various oils and their medicinal and traditional uses 17 THE Aromatherapy Handbook What is the value of studying a specific course with a reputed practitioner or institution? It is very important to have a comprehensive knowledge of Aromatherapy before beginning your practice for both safety and quality reasons. Education and experience are key when applying essential oils for particular medicinal results. While Aromatherapy may be considered a simple home remedy to some, it is in fact both a specific science and a complex art. Essential oils consist of mixtures of complex chemical components. Many of these compounds have powerful healing capacities when appropriately applied, but some can be harmful. Safety data is mandatory knowledge for anyone using essential oils on the skin, as many can be irritating or sensitizing as well as photo-toxic. Using excessively high doses of essential oils in a bath could result in skin rash and other allergic responses, lethargy, and possible liver and central nervous system damage. When your goal is to heal, having as much and as thorough an education as possible is definitely in your, and your client's, best interest. A well-trained and well-educated Aromatherapist works with a client to develop a blend of oils that will best suit the client's needs. The essential oils chosen may work well together aesthetically or may address a particular complaint. For example, to address muscle pain effectively, it is necessary to create a blend of essential oils that will relieve the tension of the muscle and will also act upon the client mentally and emotionally to address the underlying cause of the muscle tension. This is the \"synergy\" of blending oils. Creating these synergies to most effectively practice the art of Aromatherapy requires the knowledge, awareness, and practice that can be acquired most effectively through extensive study with trained professionals. What is the work like? Aromatherapists use essential oils (natural plant essences) to improve clients' physical and emotional well-being. Aromatherapy is based on the principle that essential oils have therapeutic properties that can be used to improve health and prevent disease. It is used particularly for stress-related problems and a variety of chronic conditions. At the first session with a client, the aromatherapist: takes a full medical history from the client - sometimes the aromatherapist seeks consent from the client's doctor or other healthcare professional before treatment can begin 18 THE Aromatherapy Handbook asks the client about their lifestyle, diet, exercise regime, stress levels, allergies and any emotional issues decides which aromatherapy oil, or blend of oils, is best suited to the individual's needs - there are around 400 aromatherapy oils, each with different therapeutic properties, although most aromatherapists use a range of around 50 mixes the oils - aromatherapy oils can be diluted in a carrier oil and massaged into the skin, added to a vaporizer and inhaled, used in a bath or a compress or added to base creams and lotions with instructions for self-administration in most cases, applies the oils by a full or partial body massage to the client, who will have undressed in private and lain on a couch, covered with towels makes a note of the treatment and the blend of oils used gives the client aftercare instructions, e.g. after using some oils the skin should not be exposed to direct sunlight may also supply blended oils for the client to use at home. Hours and Environment Aromatherapists tend to work flexible hours, according to the number of clients and the times that clients are free to see them. They may offer evening and weekend appointments. Some aromatherapists work part time. Aromatherapists may work in a range of environments, including: clinics in their own homes their own private clinics in other premises patients' homes complementary therapy clinics medical centers, hospitals and hospices residential care homes private physiotherapy and sports clinics health and fitness centers beauty salons. Many Aromatherapists wear a white coat, salon dress or tunic and trousers. The job involves bending, stretching and some physical effort. Some aromatherapist work at more than one location, so a driving license is useful. Salary and other benefits These figures are only a guide, as actual rates of pay may vary, depending on the employer and where people live, and these figures are low. 19 THE Aromatherapy Handbook A newly-qualified self-employed aromatherapist may earn around $3,700 to $9,400 a year until the practice has been built up. Experienced aromatherapists may earn at least $28,000 a year. An aromatherapist with a large established practice may earn $47,000 to $57,000 a year. Most aromatherapists are self-employed, so income varies according to the number of patients they treat and the amount they charge for each session. The average charge for an aromatherapy session is between $45 and $110. Sessions can last between one and two hours. Skills and personal Qualities An aromatherapist should: have excellent communication skills, particularly listening and speaking have good physical massage skills have empathy with patients and be sensitive to their problems be able to inspire trust and confidence in patients know the properties and chemistry of a large number of essential oils know when to refer a client to a doctor or other healthcare practitioner be able to keep accurate records have business skills. It is important to: like science, particularly biology and chemistry be concerned for the health and well-being of people be interested in self-employment. Aromatherapy is a Growing Business or Employment Opportunity As most aromatherapists are self-employed, advertised vacancies are unusual. It's one of the fastest growing fields in the world today. It is the art and science of using aromas, essential plant oils, in treatments. According to the National Association of Holistic Aromatherapy, this field is now \"a $300 million a year business estimated to quadruple in the next five years.\" 20 THE Aromatherapy Handbook What kinds of Courses May Be Offered There are many different organizations and awarding bodies offering aromatherapy qualifications. Course subjects may include: anatomy and physiology pathology theory of aromatherapy applied aromatherapy therapeutic relationships legislation and code of ethics business studies understanding and using research in practice reflective practice. Advancement Opportunities Progression for self-employed aromatherapists usually means building the size of their business. To do this, they need to establish a good professional reputation and have the right business skills. Some combine practice with training student aromatherapists. Some aromatherapists train in additional complementary therapies, like reflexology or stress management, which allows them to offer additional services to their clients. 21 THE Aromatherapy Handbook Introduction One of the most pleasant, relaxing and therapeutic ways of experiencing aromatherapy, is through aromatherapy massage. When stress and depression are a major cause of a health imbalance, a full aromatherapy body massage is the best complementary therapy treatment available. It is also an excellent preventative treatment to ensure continuation of good health. Contents Effects of Massage Therapy What to expect during Aromatherapy Massage o Different Therapeutic Massage Techniques How Does it Work? Training and Referrals to Aromatherapists The Benefits of Aromatherapy Massage in Palliative Care Effects of Massage Therapy Massage therapy has been shown to be highly beneficial in relieving tension and stress. It can affect the involuntary nervous system, and calm the fight or flight response, thereby reducing the level of harmful stress hormones in the body. Massage stimulates the blood circulation, increasing the supply of nutrients and oxygen to cells. Massage also stimulates lymphatic flow, thus improving tissue drainage and the immune system. The effects are best when long flowing connected strokes are applied. Many studies have shown that high, prolonged stress levels can increase the likelihood of contracting various diseases, and reduce recovery time when we do become ill. Stress can cause and aggravate many chronic conditions such as hypertension, migraines, digestive problems, and PMS. Through treatments involving massage therapy and aromatherapeutic essential oils, relaxation can be induced more frequently and the progression of many chronic conditions can also be reduced. Specific somatic (refers to the body, as opposed to the mind) techniques, working on specific areas, can reduce chronic and acute muscular tension and pain, by helping to lengthen and release shortened and contracted muscles. These techniques may include stretching, deep tissue, sports massage, neuromuscular, Rolfing, myofascial release. Massage therapy has long been recognized as an important part of athletic training. Most serious athletes receive regular somatic work. Massage therapists have been an integral part of the Olympic Games for many years now, helping to improve athletic achievement and increase recovery time after performance. 23 What to Expect During Aromatherapy Massage Massage therapy is beneficial, use of essential oils is beneficial, to combine the two can be synergistically (2 things working together to produce a better result than when done separately) even more beneficial than either therapy separately. Most massage therapists will request a new client to provide some personal information relating to their current physical state. It is also helpful to find out whether or not the client has any current illnesses of injuries that may affect the aromatherapy massage treatment. Practitioners of aromatherapy massage will generally have a longer list of questions and areas of discussion. A holistic practitioner considers the client as a \"whole\" - body, mind and spirit. They will generally help the client think of what factors in their lives may be affecting them. For example, someone who suffers from insomnia may have family worries, stresses at work, indigestion, or simply a noisy environment: any disturbing factor which could affect their sleep patterns. Rather than only using a relaxing and sedative blend of essential oils, together with a calming massage, a good practitioner will suggest other ways that the client can improve their sleep patterns. Suggestions such as a referral to a family counselor, a change at work, earplugs, or even a referral to a nutritionist - if indigestion is causing the insomnia. The practice of getting to the root cause is what makes holistic healing so much more effective. The initial consultation may take between 30 to 60 minutes, depending on the situation. When the personal history and consultation are finished, and when other suggestions and referrals have been made, the aromatherapist will select several essential oils, most suited to the client's needs at this time. The oils are then blended into a massage oil or lotion. Sometimes particular carrier oil will be used. This blend with essential oils will then be used to give the massage. The massage therapist will leave the room, allowing the client to undress as far as they are comfortable, and lay down on a padded massage table. Often, to aid in relaxation, relaxing music will be playing too. For warmth and modesty, the client will be covered with a sheet or blanket, which the massage therapist will pull back to work on each specific part of the body. THE Aromatherapy Handbook If the client feels uncomfortable at any time, or if a specific technique hurts, they should let the practitioner know. Clear communication, understanding and consent are most important. Depending on the client's needs and the practitioner's individual skills and training, different styles of somatic (refers to the body, as opposed to the mind) work may be used. Different Therapeutic Massage Techniques All these different massage techniques are used in aromatherapy massage. The total effect should be harmonious, and not jar in any way. The deep thumb pressures of shiatsu o the pressure of deep tissue massage that is intended to reach nerves, ligaments, tendons The soft tissue work called Swedish massage The slow, gentle, rhythmic movements of effleurage massage o appropriate for pets, infants and the infirm The massage usually lasts for an hour, but may be longer or shorter, depending on client needs. At the end of the session, the practitioner will leave the room, allowing the client a few minutes to gently \"come back to themselves,\" and get dressed. After the session, many aromatherapists will also suggest the use of a blend that the client can use at home between sessions. The practitioner will put together a blend of oils and give instructions for use to the client. 24 THE Aromatherapy Handbook Future sessions should also be agreed on. These sessions will depend on client needs, and financial situation. Many clients find that a weekly or biweekly session is most beneficial, particularly in the beginning. Some clients receive monthly sessions. Aromatherapy massage is an excellent \"maintenance tool,\" and should not just be used to \"fix a problem,\" but should be part of every day life if possible. Hippocrates stated that \"a daily aromatic bath and scented massage are the way to health.\" It would be wonderful if we could all follow that suggestion! How Does it Work? Many aromatherapists believe that essential oils are absorbed by the skin. There are however differing opinions as to how much of the components of essential oils can penetrate the skin, and indeed what their effect on the body might be when they do penetrate. It seems that some components do penetrate, but more studies are needed. Many beneficial effects can take place at the level of the skin and some skin conditions can be improved by the anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial properties of the essential oils. During a massage, some of the volatile essential oils are inhaled and some absorption is likely through the nose and mouth. Also the volatile molecules of the essential oils lock onto receptor cells at the back of the nose. An electrochemical message is sent to the limbic area of the brain, and appears to trigger memory and emotional responses, which in turn cause messages to be sent to other parts of the brain and body. In this way, the production of euphoric, relaxing, sedative or stimulating neurochemicals is stimulated. Many beneficial mental and emotional effects can be seen this way. Training and Referrals to Aromatherapists Those who are looking for an aromatherapy massage practitioner should take the time to find someone with appropriate training. Most massage schools will often briefly talk about the use of essential oils, but frequently this is not adequate or safe training. A personal referral from a friend is good. In the USA, The National Association for Holistic Aromatherapy or the American Alliance of Aromatherapy may be able to suggest some Aromatherapists who practice massage therapy in your area. There is at present no standard in the USA for training in aromatherapy, although this is being discussed and developed by the industry. It is therefore important to ask questions: 25 THE Aromatherapy Handbook with whom and where did the aromatherapist train how long was the training and what subjects did it cover how long have they been in practice The American Massage Therapy Association can provide referrals to a massage therapist in your area. You may wish to receive information on a massage therapist who is certified by the National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage & Bodywork (USA only). Since massage therapy is regulated differently in each state, it is impossible to list all local regulations here. Some states require licensing and statutory training, some do not. The Benefits of Aromatherapy Massage in Palliative Care Aromatherapy and Massage Therapy are complementary treatments. These treatments are rising in popularity among patients and healthcare professionals. They are increasingly being used in palliative (any treatment that offers relief but does not cure) care to improve the quality of life of patients. Research conducted at the Marie Curie Cancer Care, in London, England, provides new clinical evidence of the benefits that these combined and complementary therapies offer cancer patients. Researchers assessed the effects of massage and aromatherapy on 103 cancer patients in a palliative care setting. The patients were randomly allocated to receive massage using carrier oil (massage) or massage using a carrier oil plus Roman Chamomile essential oil (aromatherapy massage). Results indicated that there was a statistically significant reduction in anxiety and stress after each massage and the patients who received aromatherapy massage also noted improvements in their disposition, physical comfort and their quality of life. The report concludes that massage with or without essential oils appears to reduce levels of anxiety. I also found the benefits are clearly enhanced by the addition of Roman Chamomile essential oil. The aromatherapy massage treatment seemed to help improve physical and psychological symptoms, as well as the patients' overall quality of life. 26 THE Aromatherapy Handbook Introduction Aromatherapy recipes have been collected for hundreds of years, from every corner of the world.

Massage opens and increases the flow of energy, balancing the entire nervous system and helps to release physical and emotional disharmony.

Most aromatherapy massage recipes contain essential oils added to a \"carrier oil\" which is then applied to the body. More commonly used carrier oils in skin care The more commonly used carrier oils in skin care preparations are listed below. Hazelnut Oil Hazelnut oil is pressed from, obviously, Hazelnuts. This is considered the most gentle of the carrier oils, suitable for all skin types. It often serves as the primary base oil in blends, making up a majority of the mixture. 29 THE Aromatherapy Handbook Rosehip Seed Oil Rosehip seed oil is pressed from Rosehip seeds grown in the mountains of South America. This well researched oil not only has a wealth of essential fatty acids, but contains trans-retinoic acid, a compound similar to the active ingredient of Retin-A (a well known wrinkle cream), but without the drying side effects. Evening Primrose Oil Evening Primrose oil is often included in blends for aging skin and for eczema. It has one of the highest known concentrations of gamma- linolenic acid (GLA), an essential fatty acid which may be crucial to optimal health.

Essential Oils can be dissolved in an oil base and applied by hand, i.e., they can be rubbed onto the skin during massage or applied to particular parts of the body by aromatherapy practitioners to alleviate headaches or other ailments. A few drops can be put on a handkerchief or tissue to help people sleep. Others are formulated into bath salts, gels, etc. which can be dissolved into running bath water to give a relaxing fragrance. In fact, a few drops of your favorite Essential Oil can be put directly into the bath. The best time to do this is after you've finished running the bath. You put in around 3 drops (I love lavender!), give it a few minutes to form a surface on top of the bath water before you get in and then RELAX! When you emerge, you'll find that it stays on your skin, moisturizing it, and of course you have the lingering reminder of it on your person! Essential Oils can be used to keep clothes smelling nice. They can be added to dried petals as in potpourri, which can be put in sachets and put in drawers, or just left out in bowls. The most popular way to use Essentials Oils is to put them in devices that allow the smell to diffuse into the air. This can be for various purposes: To make the environment relaxing, calm, or even sensual! To help with stress management (e.g., in a doctor's surgery, in offices, etc.) To creating a peaceful atmosphere for meditating. To help people who have congested chests breathe easily. To protect people from biting insects. 44 THE Aromatherapy Handbook Candles scented with Essential Oils can be used (see below).

Please visit: Mountain Rose Herbs.com 48 THE Aromatherapy Handbook Introduction Aromatheraphy for cats is the practice of using essential oils for healing. The essential oils come from plants, seeds, flowers, bark, and roots. The essential oils act as the plant's defense system against bacteria, molds, yeasts, viruses and other insects. So, how does this apply to cats? In the past, essential oils were thought to be safe for cats and have been recommended for the treatment of stress, mites, and upper respiratory conditions. New evidence over the last few years has shown this to be incorrect, and essential oils can be toxic to cats when applied to the skin, taken internally or even inhaled. Cats react differently to various essential oils, whereas they have been beneficial to humans and even dogs. The problem is that cats' livers cannot expel the chemicals in the essential oils like humans, and even dogs, can. The toxicity build up in cats can develop very quickly via internal or external application or even breathing over an extended period of time. This can lead to serious liver damage or even death. The symptoms of toxicity buildup in cats include: Awkward movement Dizziness Vomiting Lack of energy Lack of appetite Excessive tear production in the eyes Sneezing Pacing or whining Licking themselves excessively Since cats have very thin skin, essence oils are absorbed quickly, and therefore, enter the blood stream almost immediately. Remember, cats do not like strong odors and will generally stay away from them. 50 THE Aromatherapy Handbook Essential Oils Potentially Toxic to Cats Several case studies have verified the benefits of treating cats with essence oils. However, while the application of a particular essence oil on one cat can be beneficial, the same application to another cat can lead to side effects. Below is a list of some of the essential oils that can cause problems with your cats. Peppermint Lemon Oil Lavender Oil Tea Tree Oil Cinnamon Bark Oil Wintergreen Oil Thyme Oil Birch Oil Oregano Clove Mountain Savory Cassia Peppermint Peppermint and products that contain Pennyroyal are toxic to cats because they contain phenols that a cat's liver cannot process. It takes exposure to these products over a long period of time before the cats will show signs of toxicity. The cats are just unable to eliminate the poisons from their bodies. Common cleaning solutions such as Pine-sol and Lysol contain phenols. Special care should be paid to rinse well the area to eliminate the possibility that the cats will ingest it from licking their paws or even breathe large amounts of the fumes. Lemon Oil Lemon oil is used as a bathroom cleaner and is a strong germicide, astringent, and air disinfectant. After cleaning an area with a household cleaner that contains lemon oil, make sure you thoroughly rinse and dry the area. If your cat is in the same area, make sure they can leave the room if they want to. Remember, cats are very sensitive to smells. Lavender Oil There are several cases where cats have been treated with Lavender oil in an effort to help alleviate stress. Lavender oil does contain ketones that can cause neurological symptoms over a prolonged period of exposure. 51 THE Aromatherapy Handbook Tea Tree Oil The National Animal Poison Control Center has received several reports of tea tree oil poisoning in the United States. There is no antidote for tea tree oil toxicosis in cats and it can lead to death. The prolonged exposure to tea tree oil will lead to a toxicity buildup in the cat's liver. Cinnamon Bark Oil Cinnamon Bark is a strong antibacterial and antifungal oil, providing a good air freshener during the winter months for humans. However, it is a strong sensitizer and an irritant and therefore, should not be used on or around cats. It also contains high levels of phenols and is not recommended for use with cats. Phenols are defined as organic compounds that are byproducts of petroleum refining, tanning, and textile, dye, and resin manufacturing. Low concentrations cause taste and odor problems in water; higher concentrations can kill aquatic life and humans. Wintergreen Oil Wintergreen oil contains a high content of Methyl Salicylate, which builds up in the body, and can contribute to Salicylate poisoning and is toxic to cats. Thyme Oil The FDA generally recognizes thyme and thyme oil as being safe. However, thyme oil can irritate the skin when applied topically. Taken internally in large doses, it is poisonous. Thymol is especially toxic, and can produce the following symptoms: nausea, vomiting, gastritis, headache, dizziness, convulsions, coma, cardiac arrest, and respiratory collapse. Birch Oil Birch oils contain Methyl Salicylate, which builds up in the cat's liver, and can contribute to Salicylate poisoning. It is toxic to cats. Oregano, Clove, Mountain Savory, and Cassia Oregano, cassia contain high levels of phenols and are not recommended for use with cats. 52 THE Aromatherapy Handbook DRUGS TO AVOID IN CATS This is a list of drugs to avoid giving to cats unless under direction of your veterinarian. ACETAMINOPHEN and PHENACETIN CHLOR-TRIMATON - These drugs can cause depression, vomiting, fever, muscle tremors, rapid or depressed heart rates, disorientation, and seizures. ASPIRIN (ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID, SALICYLATE) Pepto-Bismol. Treatment - There is no specific antidote. CHOCOLATE (THEOBROMINE) AND CAFFEINE POISONING - Treatment - No antidote exists; treatment is supportive. Fluids are given as part of supportive treatment. NONSTEROIDAL in this chapter of the e-book, Aromatherapy, has not been evaluated or approved by the Food and Drug Administration. This information is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease. We do not make any claims to this effect. This information is not intended to replace professional veterinary and/or medical advice. If you decide to use essential oils on your cats, always use a highly diluted formula. If you have any doubts about essential oils, use hydrosols instead of essential oils on your cats. Hydrosols are water based and are gentler and much easier for your cat to tolerate. Here are some additional guidelines for the use of essential oils with your cats: Use a diluted formula of at least 10:1 with mixing oil. Do not diffuse any essential oils or blends around your cats. Make sure your cats have the opportunity to leave the room where you are working, or place the cats in another room. Avoid household cleaning products with essential oils (citrus or pine). 53 THE Aromatherapy Handbook Introduction Problems encountered in the summertime are external parasites like fleas and ticks. The first line of defense against any internal or external pests is a healthy diet and healthy animal. The healthier the animal, the less likely that a parasite will be able to take hold. Fleas feed on warm-blooded animals. The most common species is the cat flea, which will bite humans, dogs, rats, chickens, raccoons and cats. The flea will lay eggs on its animal host. When the eggs hatch, the larvae drop off the fur onto furniture, blankets or the carpet and live by feeding on adult flea droppings. This larval stage can last from seven days to over a year. Larvae emerge as adults when a host is present. Flea bites cause scratching and serious allergies in animals and humans. Fleas can leap vertically up to seven inches and horizontally thirteen inches. Eggs are smooth, oval and white and the larvae are 1/4-inch long bristly-haired creatures. Fleas rarely bite humans unless the infestation is heavy. Flea Control To control them, follow these tips: Vacuum on a regular basis, picking up adult and egg-stage fleas. Vacuum up a tablespoon of cornstarch to ensure the fleas' demise, and dispose of the bag immediately. Steam cleaning may be needed as a supplement to kill adult and larval fleas, as well as some eggs. Wash removable floor coverings located in areas where there are known infestations and any bedding for pets. Restrict pets to a single bed and wash it frequently. Sprinkling the bed with aromatic cedar shavings, rosemary, fennel or rye will help. Groom pet with a flea comb daily. Pick off fleas from the comb and drop into soapy water or hold comb in soapy water. Also bathe your pet frequently. Give pets vitamin B1, such as a small dose of brewer's yeast. A better option might be to go to the veterinarian for a B-complex vitamin supplement. Light traps are effective for flea control, using either sticky paper or a small tub of soapy water to catch attracted fleas. Heat treatment is also effective to control flea infestations. Larvae die after exposure to 103\u00b0F for one hour. 55 THE Aromatherapy Handbook Natural Remedies Natural Remedies include: Nematodes applied to the lawn as a spray enter the fleas' bodies, feeding on tissue and releasing harmful bacteria. They do not affect people, pets or plants, and occur naturally in soil, so they will not adversely affect beneficial soil organisms. Diatomaceous earth is effective flea control when applied in a light dusting to upholstered furniture and exposed area. Avoid breathing in desiccating dusts and always wear a mask and goggles when applying this product. Boric acid worked into the nap of carpet can be used to control fleas. Exercise caution when using products containing boric acid and do not use in areas where children or pets will come in direct contact with the chemical. Don Hamilton, DVM, has some excellent suggestions for controlling fleas naturally. In his book, Homeopathic Care for Cats and Dogs, he suggests initially, to control fleas, try shampooing your dog (or cat) weekly. You don't need a flea shampoo. Just use a good healthy shampoo, lather up and leave on for 10 minutes. Then do a good rinse. The bath disrupts the life cycle of the flea. If you prefer using herbal products, you can rinse the dog with Lavender, eucalyptus and pennyroyal. All appear to repel fleas. (These oils may be toxic to cats, so don't use them on cats.) How to Flight Fleas How to fight fleas the natural way: Vacuum your home frequently and seal vacuum bags before disposing. Wash the bedding of your dog weekly in warm soapy water. This is where fleas usually breed. Bathing your pet weekly with a mild dog shampoo prevents flea invasion. Use cedar shampoo for your dog, and put cedar oil in their sleeping mats. Cedar will repel fleas and other insects. Fleas are attracted to dry skin, so to avoid it, give your dog Linatone oil mixed with its food. Excessive shampooing should be avoided. A mixture of brewer's yeast and garlic, available in powder or tablet form can be given in small doses to your pet. This creates a certain odor in pets, and fleas are sure to avoid them. Fresh or dried pennyroyal leaves is a natural flea repellent. Use this in carpets to avoid the abundance of fleas in the home. Do not use it if you have small children around, or cats, as this could be toxic. A mixture of 60 ml of Lavender oil with 2.8 liters of rock salt can also be placed in areas where dogs usually come in contact with the home environment. This solution could also be used to wash your dog. 56 THE Aromatherapy Handbook Planting marigolds in the yard is helpful, too, as it repels certain types of bugs as well as fleas. Boiled lemon or orange peel in water can be used as a dip for dogs and can be used also to soak into dog bedding for a few hours, then washed with warm soapy water. Lukewarm water with a little shampoo and detergent is a good way to prevent fleas. A dog's body may be dipped into the solution for fifteen minutes and then rinsed. This only works if flea infestation is light. Aromatherapy Mosquito Control Aromatic cedar oil used as a spray mist will help eliminate mosquitoes from your yard or area. There is also a mosquito fogger that is designed to control flying insects, ticks and other pests that inhabit your yard or structures. 57 THE Aromatherapy Handbook When we have a health problem today, most people take some type of drug to take care of it. Have you ever thought about the suffering people must have gone through 500 or 1,000 years ago? Well, it's possible they didn't suffer as much as we might think. Instead of buying a drug for their health problems like we do today, our ancestors may have just picked a few plants, and some of those plants may have worked better than some of the drugs we take today. One reason I say this is because most of today's drugs usually come with some side effects that can cause other problems in our bodies. I am grateful for all the new inventions and new technology, but the older I get the more I realize that everything we have today came from something basic, and I think it is time we return to the basics with our health care. It's really not my idea. Every year more and more people are trying alternative health care. What I would like to introduce you to today are some of the essential oils used in Aromatherapy. Eucalyptus Essential Oil - Eucalyptus essential oil is used most often for respiratory conditions, such as a cough or a cold. It has also been used in the treatment of flu.

It should always be mixed with another oil. Serious burning can occur from direct concentrated contact. While certain essential oils have been beneficial in treating certain conditions in certain patients, I cannot state as fact that any of the oils can help you in any health related issues. You should always consult a qualified Aromatherapist before using any of the essential oils mentioned above for any health related illnesses. 60 THE Aromatherapy Handbook Chapter 10 Potential Risks of Essential Oils By Dr. R.J. Peters It's important to exercise caution and discretion in the use of aromatic oils and essences, as they have the potential to cause complications due to their complex chemical natures and because they are extremely concentrated and volatile. Always consult with a qualified practitioner and follow accepted safety guidelines.
