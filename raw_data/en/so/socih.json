The way we think, move, eat, drink and breathe all equate to how we hold up in our world today. My hope is that by passing on some tools you can add to your immune boosting toolkit it will empower you to take charge of your health and give you peace of mind. This information is helpful year-round and not just in times of high risk. The information in this article comes from 20 years of anecdotal experience coupled with scientific research. The following information is what I use, very effectively, to boost the immune system in anyone suffering from a virus. AVOID EGGS, DAIRY and GLUTEN. The most common allergies that I see in greater than 95% of my patients are EGGS, DAIRY and GLUTEN. When a person is consuming foods that their body is reacting to it creates a stressful physiological state and does not allow that food to support and repair them, but instead inflame and deplete them. For example, most people become phlegmy after eating dairy, an allergic response, which creates the perfect breeding ground for viruses and bacteria to take hold and proliferate. LOAD UP ON - ZINC, LYSINE and VITAMIN C. When we don't have enough zinc, our immune system cannot function properly. Zinc and Lysine have been shown to stop viral replication and allow for our immune system to get the virus in check quickly, shortening the duration of the virus. Zinc is also essential for over 200 reactions in the body; we can't afford to be deficient. Vitamin C is an antioxidant that feeds your immune system. While protecting your own cells from oxidation, Vitamin C is an anti-inflammatory that has the ability to oxidize a pathogen, causing them to breakdown and loose strength. CAT'S CLAW - the Cat's Claw herb is a powerful antiviral. It's one of the best tools against viruses, sinus infections, sore throats and digestive issues. GOLDENSEAL - Goldenseal is great for acute viral infections, such as colds, flus, and other viruses. It helps give a boost to white blood cells called lymphocytes that are responsible for protecting us from viral invaders. Below are the protocols/dosages recommended to boost the immune system when you're feeling healthy or when you're feeling the onset of symptoms. PROTOCOL - TO BOOST THE SYSTEM: - Zinc sulphate - 2tsp, 2 times per day with food. - L-Lysine 1000mg, 2 times per day. - Vitamin C 1000mg, 2 times per day. - Cat's Claw - 500mg, 2 times per day. - Goldenseal - 500mg, 2 times per day. PROTOCOL - IF YOU HAVE SYMPTOMS: - Zinc sulphate - 2tsp every 3 waking hours with food. - L-Lysine 1000mg, 3 times per day. - Vitamin C 2000mg, 3 times per day. - Cat's Claw - 1500mg, 2 times per day. - Goldenseal - 1000mg, 3 times per day. INFRARED SAUNA - Most viruses are susceptible to heat which is why we don't see the flu much in the summer months. Using an infrared sauna for 20-40 minutes mimics a fever, therefore making you an unfavorable host to most viruses. GET ADJUSTED - Chiropractic adjustments have shown to boost the T4 immune response by 50% over the course of six months. In other words, your immune system gets a 50% boost under chiropractic care! GET AN IMMUNITY IV - Nutrient IV's allow vitamins, minerals and amino acids to be 100% absorbed by the body so you get the boost you need when you need it NOW! MEDITATE and DON'T WATCH THE NEWS - When we're stressed, the immune system's ability to fight off invaders is reduced. That is why we are more susceptible to virus and infections. Guided meditation can help you stay focused while you reduce your negative, stressful thought patterns and lower your cortisol levels. Watching the news raises cortisol and makes us feel helpless and fearful - limit your exposure. It is my intention to bring helpful information to those seeking it.
