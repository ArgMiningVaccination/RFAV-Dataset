This is how most chiropractors practice, and I believe most of them are great at what they do. It falls under the umbrella category of symptom relief/symptom management. Structural Chiropractic Think of your spine as the foundation for a building. If the foundation was off, would you expect the floors to creak, the walls to crack and windows to break down? Now you can spend time patching all the damage, but you would be doing so with the expectation that in a short time the problems will have to be.....? ....Repaired Again....and Again.... And suddenly instead of achieving a true correction, we're relying on chiropractic like a natural (and sometimes expensive) aspirin. Get Back to Normal Rather than constantly repairing damage, at Precision Chiropractic, we've chosen to fix the underlying Foundation and help your spine reach Normal Structure. Of course our services aren't for everyone. However, if you are tired of constantly patching the problem and you're looking for a long term solution that you can both feel AND see for yourself, then Specific may be the right place for you. Once the foundation has been fixed, then we'll teach you how to keep it that way through customized recommendations designed for your spine, so that the problem doesn't come back. "}
