Information You Need: Holiday Gathering Safety Reminders With many future fall and winter holidays coming up soon, here are a few safety suggestions to keep in mind if you decide to get together with family and friends this year! Before getting together: - For some it can be helpful to have an open conversation with family and friends to discuss questions, concerns, or varying levels of comfortability regarding getting together in-person. - For those who are not comfortable visiting in person, have them join in on the festivities via a live video call! - Ensure all members getting together in person are feeling healthy and well prior to the gathering. If individuals are feeling ill, it is important they do not attend to prevent anyone else from getting sick. - Consider asking guests to get a COVID-19 test prior to the gathering to be extra safe. - Take extra safety precautions if you, or a friend or family member, are immunocompromised as you may not be as protected against COVID-19, despite their vaccination status. [Visit the CDC's website for a list of these precautions.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/gatherings.html) - If you need to travel to attend a holiday gathering, read [Domestic Travel During COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html)from CDC. - Consider postponing or cancelling if there are increasing rates of COVID-19 in your area. Instead, consider a drive-by visit or video call to loved ones. Cooking and delivering food to your loved ones is also considered low-risk and can be a great way to make someone's holiday special. During the gathering: - Whenever possible, it is always good to host holiday gatherings outdoors. - If it is not possible to host outdoors, opening doors and windows if possible as well as using fans can help to increase air flow indoors. A well-ventilated space is ideal. - Practice good hygiene with regular hand washing or using hand sanitizer and avoid touching your face - this is always a good idea! - Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces regularly during the gathering, like door handles, cabinet pulls, light switches, counter tops, remote controls, and faucets in busy rooms like kitchens, living rooms, and bathrooms. - Encourage guests to help by placing sanitizing wipes and cleaning supplies where they are visible and easily accessible, but safely out of reach of children and pets. - Avoid finger food and other open, shared foods like cheese boards and buffets and limit the time that people spend standing near/around those open food sources.

All Things Vaccines: Mix-and-Match Vaccine Boosters The FDA and CDC have advised that it is safe to mix-and-match your booster vaccine, which means that it is safe to receive a booster dose from a different vaccine manufacturer than what was given for your initial dose(s). For example, this means that if you had originally received the two-dose Pfizer shot series, you are able to receive either J&J, Pfizer, or Moderna as a booster dose if you meet the eligibility criteria for one. Please see the [CDC's website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html) for vaccine guidance for individuals with underlying health conditions or who are immunocompromised. In some cases, individuals with underlying health conditions may have received an additional vaccine already during the initial vaccination series. If this applies to you, you may still be eligible for a booster but should discuss the best option with your primary care provider. It is not currently recommended at this time for a person to receive more than three complete mRNA vaccine doses. These recommendations are likely to change as more data becomes available, so it is always a good idea to talk to your primary healthcare provider or visit the CDC's website for the most current guidance before scheduling a booster vaccination.
