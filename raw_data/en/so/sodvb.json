But most significantly, in the late 1800s, the spine and nervous system were given specialized, intense research and study. Daniel David (D.D.) Palmer was a man with an investigative nature whose intellect focused on the healing arts. After years of studying human health and disease, he formed a hypothesis and systematized the knowledge upon which the modern chiropractic science, art and philosophy are based. Chiropractic concerns itself with the relationship between structure (primarily the spine) and function (primarily coordinated by the nervous system) of the human body and how that relationship affects the restoration and preservation of health. Chiropractic employs neither drugs nor surgery. It's concerned with the entire environment of the body and is based on a properly functioning nervous system, which begins with the brain and courses through the spinal cord encased within the spinal column. No part of the body escapes the dominance of the nervous system. Spinal biomechanical dysfunction\u2014improper function of the spine due to slight misalignments\u2014can cause a state of poor health in an area far removed from the spine and spinal cord itself and can reduce the ability of the body to adapt to an ever-changing environment. The slightest malfunction of the spine may alter the regular transmission of nerve impulses, preventing that portion of the body from responding with its full inherent capacity. The chiropractic student, during five rigorous academic years of study, normally completed in three-and-one-third calendar years, is trained to know all structures and functions of the human body and to recognize the interrelationship of all parts. Chiropractic education centers on the concept of health, not disease. Chiropractors provide a highly appealing primary health care approach because they don't perform surgery or prescribe medicine. Chiropractic is increasingly sought as the public's demand for health maintenance grows. If, however, a Doctor of Chiropractic determines a patient requires attention from another branch of the health-care professions, that recommendation or referral is encouraged. Upon receiving the Doctor of Chiropractic Degree, most graduates enter private practice. Others may elect to become an associate of an established chiropractor or other integrative, multi-disciplinary practice or work within the military, while some may decide to enter chiropractic education in a teaching, research or administrative capacity. No matter the choice, the individual is a participant in and contributor to the world's health care delivery system. According to the American Chiropractic Association, D.C.s treat more than 35 million people annually. We invite you to explore a profession that focuses on lifetime health rather than short-term disease treatment. The College has developed and refined its guiding documents over the years, which provide the institution with principles to guide its actions as well as set high standards for excellence and achievement. These documents are approved by the Board of Trustees and are thoughtfully updated as circumstances require. IDENTITY STATEMENT The primary care professional for spinal health and well-being. CHIROPRACTIC PILLARS Doctors of Chiropractic: Integrate evidence, clinical experience, and patient values and preferences Deliver expert chiropractic adjustments, manipulation and other manual treatments Embody a tradition of caring, effectiveness and patient satisfaction Collaborate and coordinate care with other health professionals Enhance patient quality of life and performance 8 Promote vitality, wellness and patient empowerment Improve quality of life without drugs or surgery Offer readily accessible care MISSION The mission of Palmer College of Chiropractic is to promote learning, deliver health care, engage our communities and advance knowledge through research. VISION Palmer College of Chiropractic strives to be The Trusted Leader in Chiropractic Education. \u00ae VALUES The Values of the Palmer College Community include: Academic excellence Business acumen Collaboration Communication Community health Critical thinking Diversity Evidence-based chiropractic practice Heritage and tradition Justice, ethics and integrity Life-long learning PHILOSOPHY STATEMENT Chiropractic is a science, art and philosophy. The philosophy of chiropractic is built upon the constructs of vitalism, holism, conservatism, naturalism and rationalism. It provides context for the application of science and art. Health is a state of optimal physical, emotional and social well-being. Central to the philosophy of chiropractic is the principle that life is intelligent. This innate intelligence strives to maintain a state of health through adaptation mechanisms. The nervous system is recognized as an avenue for these self-regulating processes. Interference with neurological function can impede these mechanisms, disrupt homeostatic balance and adversely impact health. Chiropractic posits that subluxation of the spinal column and other articulations can affect nervous system function and the expression of health, which may result in symptoms, infirmity and disease. The understanding of the subluxation complex continues to progress from D.D. Palmer's early writings about misalignment of vertebrae and other articulating structures to include additional anatomical, physiological, biomechanical, chemical and biopsychosocial factors. PRACTICE PARADIGM Chiropractic focuses on neurological and musculoskeletal integrity, and aims to favorably impact health and well-being, relieve pain and infirmity, enhance performance, and improve quality of life without drugs or surgery. The Doctor of Chiropractic is a primary care provider for the prevention, diagnosis and conservative management of spine-related disorders and associated locomotor conditions. Serving the patient's best interest in a professional and ethical manner, the Doctor of Chiropractic employs experience and the best available evidence to make clinical decisions, deliver care and manage identified health concerns and conditions. In addition, doctors of chiropractic comply with the laws and regulations governing chiropractic practice in the applicable jurisdiction, including documentation, coding and billing practices. The practice of chiropractic includes clinically necessary: Assessments of a patient's health status, needs, concerns and conditions by obtaining a case-appropriate history and physical examination, and by acquiring necessary imaging, laboratory or diagnostic studies; Consideration of axial (spine) and appendicular (extremity) structure and function, including subluxation, and the status of contiguous muscular and neural systems by means of physical evaluation, imaging and/or special test procedures; Patient-centered management consistent with the obtained history, clinical information and diagnoses; Care coordination accomplished through goal-oriented management plans that include treatment recommendations intended to favorably influence outcomes, prognosis, risks, behaviors and lifestyle; Administration of manual therapeutic procedures 9 such as chiropractic adjustment, manipulation, mobilization or soft tissue techniques - as indicated by the history and clinical examination; academic and the clinical experience. As the premier institution of chiropractic education, Palmer College is dedicated to offering students an exceptional education through a Use of complementary measures, such as passive modalities, active exercise and rehabilitation, nutritional counseling and supplementation, bracing, strapping and orthoses, and other procedures allowed under respective chiropractic practice acts; and Promotion of health, wellness and disease prevention by evaluating relevant indicators and risk factors, and by providing care directed at mitigating health risks and encouraging healthy lifestyles. THE PALMER EDUCATIONAL PRINCIPLES The following is a statement of educational principles held by Palmer College of Chiropractic, which is comprised of three campuses in: Davenport, Iowa Port Orange, Florida San Jose, California Palmer College of Chiropractic recognizes the need to maintain an optimum learning environment through a sustained commitment to excellence and continual improvement. The following reconfirm Palmer's role as an innovative, dynamic and exciting community of diverse learners and scholars. 1. Palmer College embraces the philosophy that life is intelligent and that the human body possesses an inherent potential to maintain itself in a natural state of homeostasis through its innate/inborn intelligence. Moreover, the science of chiropractic emphasizes the relationship between structure and function, primarily that between the spinal column and the nervous system. Implicit within this statement is the significance of the nervous system to health and the effect of the subluxation complex upon the nervous system and, therefore, the body. 2. Palmer College is a learning community. The College is dedicated to developing, sustaining and refining a vertically and horizontally integrated chirocentric curriculum where excellence in teaching and learning is realized throughout the curriculum that is dynamic in nature.

As Doctors of Chiropractic, they'll have high expectations of their own efforts and they'll see learning as extending far beyond the classroom and clinic to their life responsibilities as health care professionals. Palmer College is dedicated to teaching students how to learn. 5. Palmer College expects faculty to be effective teachers, productive scholars and focused academicians. The three are inextricably intertwined. Effective teaching over a career can only be maintained through productive scholarship.

Palmer. The science, art and philosophy of chiropractic evolved from D.D. Palmer's years of independent research and study of human health and disease. Following the successful application of his knowledge to initial patients in 1895, he began teaching others in Davenport, Iowa. The first classes of the Palmer School and Cure (later known as the Palmer Infirmary and Chiropractic Institute, the Palmer School of Chiropractic and, finally, Palmer College of Chiropractic) were held in 1897. Palmer is the founding college of chiropractic. Palmer College created the foundation for this dynamic profession and is known as The Trusted Leader in Chiropractic Education \u00ae. In many ways, the history of chiropractic is the story of four generations of Palmers; Daniel David Palmer, usually called D.D.; his son, Bartlett Joshua Palmer, D.C., called B.J., and B.J.'s wife, Mabel Heath Palmer, D.C.; B.J. and Mabel's son, David D. Palmer, D.C., often called Dr. Dave; his wife, Agnes Mae High Palmer, D.C.; and their daughters, Bonnie Palmer McCloskey, Jenny Wren Palmer Sutton, H.C.D. (Hon.), and Vickie Anne Palmer, H.C.D. (Hon.). Each of the Palmer daughters has served the College and Board of Trustees in various roles. One of D.D. Palmer's early students was his son, Dr. Bartlett Joshua Palmer. Upon completing the course of study, B.J. (as he came to be known throughout the world) headed the school from 1906 until his death in 1961. One of B.J.'s first acts was to incorporate the school and change the name to Palmer School of Chiropractic, which was chartered in 1907. During B.J.'s years of leadership, international attention was brought to the chiropractic profession and the school. His drive, creativity and capacity for attracting strong faculty and administrators propelled the school forward. By 1920, three major buildings\u2014 Administration, D.D. Palmer Memorial and B.J. Palmer Hall\u2014had been constructed. The first X-ray equipment in the chiropractic profession was in full use in the classroom and the patient clinic. Clinical research also was underway. Dr. Mabel Heath Palmer, B.J.'s wife and a Palmer graduate, was the treasurer of the school and a faculty member. She earned the title First Lady of Chiropractic for her untiring devotion to chiropractic, the school and its students. After her death in 1949, B.J. continued to accomplish new goals for the school and brought the curriculum to 4,320 hours in four academic years by 1950. To honor his wife, he constructed the Mabel Heath Palmer Laboratories in 1952. With B.J. Palmer's death in 1961, the Palmer presidency passed to his son, David Daniel Palmer, D.C. As did his father and grandfather before him, Dr. Dave, as he was known, brought his own brand of leadership to Palmer. Referred to as The Educator, Dr. David D. Palmer, was the son of Drs. B.J. and Mabel Heath Palmer. Born on the Palmer campus and raised among the faculty and students, Dr. Dave became president of Palmer in 1961. Dr. Dave graduated from the prestigious Wharton School of Finance & Commerce at the University of Pennsylvania in 1929. While at the Wharton School he focused on business, law and economics. He went on to attain his Doctor of Chiropractic Degree from Palmer in 1938. He's recognized for changing the name of Palmer School of Chiropractic to Palmer College of Chiropractic, for forming the Palmer College of Chiropractic International Alumni Association, making significant progress toward official accreditation, establishing non-profit status for the College, and for modernizing the campus. He died in 1978. At the time of Dr. David Palmer's death, his dreams were still materializing. The College was accredited by the Council on Chiropractic Education in 1979 and by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools in 1984. On Oct. 17, 1980, Palmer College acquired Northern California College of Chiropractic, which became today's Palmer College of Chiropractic West in San Jose, California. Twenty-two years later, on Oct. 4, 2002, the College made it possible for even more students to learn the science, art and philosophy of chiropractic 17 by opening Palmer College of Chiropractic Florida in Port Orange, Florida In 2022, the Palmer College Board of Trustees made the difficult decision to phase out Palmer West. The campus will close when the lease ends in 2025. It was while Vickie Anne Palmer, H.C.D., was chairman of the Palmer Board of Trustees that the concept of Palmer's multi-campus system was developed. Known as The Refiner of Chiropractic, Vickie Anne Palmer has built on her family heritage by providing leadership to the chiropractic mission. Like her sisters, Bonnie Palmer McCloskey and Jenny Wren Palmer Sutton, H.C.D. (Hon.), Vickie Anne Palmer grew up on the Palmer campus and has served the College and Board of Trustees in various roles. She joined the Palmer Board of Trustees in 1978 and was elected chairman in 1987. As Board chairman, she was Instrumental in developing the concept of Palmer's multi-campus system, which today includes three campuses. In 2008, she officially concluded her 21-year tenure as chairman, though she continues to serve on the Board as secretary general and as a member of the Executive Committee. Palmer College has spawned legends and led the way for the growth of the profession and chiropractic education. It has sent more than 40,000 alumni out to practice throughout the world. One third of the world's chiropractors are Palmer graduates. The halls and corridors echo the voices of the past and the present. Science and technology blend with rich tradition at Palmer, no matter which campus you choose for your chiropractic education. Palmer has created the foundation for this dynamic profession and is a leader in the field of health care.

FACILITIES Palmer College is comprised of a Main Campus located in Davenport, Iowa, and two branch campuses in Port Orange, Florida, and San Jose, California. Each campus maintains multiple classrooms and laboratories, as well as library facilities. In addition, each student-friendly environment provides a Campus Store, computer labs, food service areas and student common areas. Each location is unique in its own right and appropriate to the region, setting and needs of its students. The Davenport, Iowa, location is steeped in history from the turn of the century. The original three buildings built in 1920 have expanded to 15 buildings, occupying 21 acres. The Main Campus houses academic, clinic and student services as well as centralized administrative services for all three campuses. The Palmer Center for Chiropractic Research, the historic Palmer Family Residence and Vickie Anne Palmer Hall also are located here. The Main Campus houses two clinics for patient care, as well as a satellite clinic in Illinois and two community-based outreach clinics. In 2002, the College's Florida campus opened its doors on 24 acres in the heart of Port Orange, a family-oriented community with more than 50,000 residents. Since then, Palmer has constructed three buildings; two housing academic, student and administrative services. The Standard Process Student Center was opened in 2012. A fourth building formerly known as the Allen Green Civic Center has been the home of the health center for patient care. There is an additional outreach clinic nearby. The San Jose campus is located in a two-story building on five acres. The campus location, in the heart of Silicon Valley, offers all the amenities and appeal of an urban environment. The layout of the campus building provides convenient access to academic, student services and administrative services. The Campus Health Center is also located at this site. The campus has a network of community-based outreach clinics providing more sites for patient care. The College strives to maintain and update all of the campus properties on a regular basis. The Facilities departments on all three campuses are available for any student to express concerns they might have. CLINICS Clinical education supports the College's mission by pursuing excellence in patient care and chiropractic education. This includes scholarship, which contributes to institutional research efforts. In doing so, the clinical education develops the intellectual, ethical and professional attributes of students in a learning oriented environment. By offering experiential learning opportunities, Palmer clinical education prepares graduates for contemporary chiropractic practice. Clinic faculty challenge interns to develop their clinical skills through the critical evaluation of each patient by using a Mentor Model. This allows faculty to guide and direct interns through the transition 24 from student to intern to doctor. The Quad Cities clinic system is comprised of five clinics. Two of these clinics are located on campus, while the other three are located in the neighboring Quad-Cities area. The Davenport Outpatient Chiropractic Clinic and the Moline Clinic satellite are excellent facilities that serve as the primary focus for patient care. Both facilities include a community outpatient clinic and digital radiology; chiropractic rehabilitation services are located at the Davenport Outpatient Clinic in the Bechtel Center. The Davenport Outpatient Clinic provides care to members of the campus community. The community outreach clinics provide chiropractic care at no or low cost to individuals of the community who cannot afford chiropractic care elsewhere.

DOCTOR OF CHIROPRACTIC DEGREE PROGRAM The Doctor of Chiropractic (D.C.) degree program is the foundation of the educational experience at Palmer College of Chiropractic. The course of study prepares graduates to succeed as primary care professionals for spinal health and well-being. The curriculum is focused on building core clinical competencies and outcomes called Palmer Abilities, which include patient evaluation skills, patient management skills, philosophy and history of chiropractic, integrating basic science into the practice of chiropractic, critical thinking and problem solving, effective communication, moral reasoning and professional ethics, professional growth and lifelong learning, health care in social and community contexts, and business management skills. The first year of the program is devoted to developing basic science knowledge; the second year to developing clinical science knowledge and skills; and the third and fourth years to applying acquired knowledge and skills in community clinical environments. Instructional methods include technology-supported lecture, lab, small group interactive sessions, and peer and service learning. The curriculum includes coursework in anatomy, physiology, pathology, public health, chiropractic philosophy, radiology, diagnosis, technique (chiropractic manual procedures), associated clinical sciences (geriatrics, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology) and business and practice management. A variety of technique electives are also offered to complement the study of adjustive procedures included in the core curriculum. A large number of student clubs comprise a co-curriculum of auxiliary education in technique, philosophy, research, evidence-based care, sports management, toastmasters, and health and fitness, to name a few. The Palmer Center for Business Development offers additional business education and assistance in locating job opportunities and opening, managing and growing a successful chiropractic practice. Each campus features a professional outpatient clinic, which provides a fertile environment for student interns to train under the tutelage of an experienced faculty mentor. A clinical preceptorship is available to student interns in their final term of enrollment in which \"on-the-job\" field training occurs in field doctors' offices or Department of Defense/ Veteran's Administration (DoD/V A) facilities. Most preceptorships offer additional opportunities for students to observe the business operations of a private chiropractic practice. The degree of Doctor of Chiropractic is awarded based upon successful completion of the required course of study in accordance with the standards of the College, which meet or exceed those of its accrediting agencies. To earn a D.C. degree from the College, a student must satisfy all academic, clinical and ethical requirements and complete not less than the final 25 percent of the total credits required in residence at the College. Up to 75 percent of the total credits may be awarded through advanced standing. SELECTION OF CANDIDATES Candidates for admission are selected based on several factors, which may include cumulative grade point average (GPA), total number of credits completed, prerequisite GPA, letters of recommendation and personal profiles/essays. Personal interviews may be conducted. We recommend that you apply as early as possible. Your Admissions Counselor will discuss term availability upon receipt. Applications are accepted and reviewed year round. Applications are reviewed on an individual basis. Candidates are selected based on availability in upcoming terms. Submission of your application in a timely manner will assist us with meeting your preferred term request. 36 An offer of acceptance into the Doctor of Chiropractic Program is considered official by the College only when made by way of a written letter sent directly from a representative of the Office of Enrollment/ Admissions to the applicant. LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS The Doctor of Chiropractic degree, in and of itself, does not entitle the recipient to practice chiropractic. Those who earn the degree must apply for license to practice in the jurisdiction of their choice. Due to the various licensure requirements in each of the 50 U.S. states, as well as in other countries, it is strongly recommended that applicants contact the respective Board of Examiners regarding pre-chiropractic educational requirements in states and countries where they may consider practicing after graduation. Some states, such as Florida, require a bachelor's degree. In addition, most licensing boards require a criminal background check prior to licensure. Neither acceptance for admission into the program nor the subsequent earning of a Doctor of Chiropractic degree guarantees that a state or foreign country will grant a graduate a license to practice chiropractic. Each state and foreign country, through its legislative and administrative process, defines the standards of competency and scope of practice of chiropractic within its jurisdiction. Such standards may include, but are not limited to, the pre-chiropractic and chiropractic education of the applicant for licensure. State boards may accept or require passing of National Board examinations as part of their licensing procedure. Information on state and international licensing requirements is available from the Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Board website at: www.FCLB.org or individually from each state board licensing office. TECHNICAL STANDARDS The College seeks to prepare students to become competent, caring Doctors of Chiropractic who serve as primary care providers for the prevention, diagnosis and conservative management of health conditions. The academic, clinical, social and personal preparation for the practice of chiropractic requires both mental and physical abilities. There are certain abilities and characteristics which are defined as Technical Standards. Those standards, in conjunction with academic standards, are requirements for admission, promotion and graduation. Although these standards serve to focus upon the necessary physical and mental abilities of all students, they are not intended to deter any student for whom reasonable accommodation will allow the fulfillment of the complete curriculum. The College has an ethical responsibility for the safety of its patients with whom students will come in contact. Although students learn and work under the supervision of the faculty, students interact with patients during their chiropractic education. Patient safety and wellbeing are therefore major factors in establishing requirements involving the physical, cognitive and emotional abilities for admission, promotion and graduation. Students must have the physical and emotional stamina and capacity to function in a competent manner in the clinical, classroom and laboratory settings. The College is committed to providing equal educational opportunities for qualified students with disabilities who apply for admission to the chiropractic degree program or who are enrolled as chiropractic students. A \"qualified person with a disability\" is an individual with a disability who meets the academic and Technical Standards required for admission or participation in the College's chiropractic educational programs, with or without accommodations. Admitted students with disabilities are reviewed individually, on a case-by-case basis, with a complete and careful consideration of all the skills, attitudes and attributes of each student to determine whether there are reasonable accommodations that would permit that student to satisfy the Technical Standards. An accommodation is not reasonable if it poses a direct threat to the health or safety of self and/or others if making it requires a substantial modification of an essential element of the curriculum, if it lowers academic standards, or poses an undue administrative or financial burden. Except in varied circumstances, 37 the use by a student of a third party (an intermediary) to perform any of the functions described in the Technical Standards would constitute an unacceptable substantial modification. All individuals considering, applying or enrolling in the Doctor of Chiropractic Degree Program (DCP) are encouraged to review the Technical Standards to better understand what is expected at Palmer. The College's Technical Standards may be accessed online at: http:// www.palmer.edu/about-us/office-of-compliance/ institutional-policy-library/ If at any point an enrolled student ceases to meet any Technical Standard the student must notify the relevant campus disability services coordinator. NBCE PASS RATES Palmer College posts the overall weighted averages of the four (4) most recent years' National Board of Chiropractic Examiners (NBCE) examinations Parts I, II, III, and IV success rates which represent the percentage of graduates who have successfully completed all Parts of the NBCE examinations within six months post-graduation. In some instances, the Canadian Chiropractic Examining Board Part C exam data are used in lieu of NBCE Part IV data. Success rate data can be found on the Palmer website at https://www.palmer.edu/about-palmer/college-profile/. CHIROPRACTIC DEGREE REQUIREMENTS The College intends for its students and graduates to become competent and compassionate physicians who are capable of meeting all requirements for chiropractic licensure. The Doctor of Chiropractic degree, in and of itself, does not entitle the recipient to practice chiropractic. Those who earn the degree must apply for a license to practice in the jurisdiction of their choice. For more information, refer to the Student Disabiity Support Center section of this Catalog or you may access the Handbook for Students and Applicants with Disabilities on the College website. JOB CLASSIFICATION CODE The job classification codes at the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the Doctor of Chiropractic degree program are 29-1010 and 29-1011. NATIONAL BOARD EXAMINATIONS National Board examinations are divided into two sections: written examinations (Part I, II, III and Physiotherapy) and practical examinations (Part IV). The written examinations are administered several times per year at multiple test sites in the United States and Canada by the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners, while the practical examinations are administered at multiple sites in the United States in May and November. All Palmer campuses currently serve as test sites for all national board examinations. Candidates for the Doctor of Chiropractic degree complete a minimum of five academic years (eight months each of classroom work) in the prescribed curriculum. The Main campus and beginning in the fall of 2022 the Florida campus operate on a trimester system, with an academic program consisting of 10 trimesters that can be completed in 3.35 calendar years, which is equal to five academic years. Assuming a normal completion rate and fulfillment of all graduation requirements, students should expect to graduate within 10 trimesters (40 months) of their matriculation date. The Palmer Florida and Palmer West campuses are phasing out a quarter system, with academic programs that consist of 13 quarters that can be completed in 3.25 calendar years, which is equal to 4.33 academic years. The phase out of the quarter system will be completed in 2025. Assuming a normal completion rate and fulfillment of all graduation requirements, students should expect to graduate within 13 quarters (39 months) of their matriculation date. Students transferring from other accredited chiropractic colleges must complete a minimum 25 percent of the prescribed curriculum while in residence at the College. The final academic year prior to graduation must be at the Palmer campus conferring the degree. CLINIC CAPSTONE PROGRAMS Tests also are given in several foreign countries. For INTERN PRECEPTORSHIP PROGRAM information on exam dates and administration sites, visit the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners This program involves a clinical educational website: www.NBCE.org. experience in an approved field doctor's chiropractic 38 practice during the student's last term. This optional program is not a substitution for service in the Palmer Chiropractic Clinics, but rather an additional opportunity for the student after fulfilling the campus clinical quantitative and qualitative requirements. During this program, the intern is supervised and practices under the guidance and license of a chiropractic field doctor contracted with the College as extension or adjunct faculty and within the laws of the state in which the preceptor resides. The intern must also periodically report in with the College. The Post-Graduate Preceptor Program involves service in the preceptor's practice after the student graduates but prior to state licensure. The intern is supervised and practices under the guidance of the chiropractic field doctor. PALMER DOD/V A STUDENT ROTATION PROGRAM This program offers students a clinical experience opportunity in a Department of Defense (DoD) or Veterans Administration (V A) health-care facility. Working with the staff chiropractor(s) in the facility, students provide chiropractic care to active military personnel and veterans. They also gain insight into developing collaborative relationships with other health professionals. Students are eligible to participate during their last two terms. RESIDENCY PROGRAMS (MAIN) Additional studies at the College are offered through two post-graduate residency programs on the Main Campus. Chiropractic Radiology Residency: This in-house three-year program provides education, training and experience in chiropractic radiology and specialized imaging. The resident is then eligible to sit for the board examination administered by the American Chiropractic Board of Radiology. Chiropractic Rehabilitation Residency: The Rehabilitation Residency is an intensive, clinical postgraduate program focusing on neuro-musculoskeletal rehabilitation care within an interdisciplinary clinical setting. This three-year program follows the educational requirements outlined by the American Chiropractic Rehabilitation Board.

ADDITIONAL ACADEMIC DEGREE (MAIN) BACHELOR OF SCIENCE DEGREE To meet the challenges of a growing chiropractic profession, Palmer's Main Campus offers students the opportunity to earn a Bachelor of Science degree in General Science in addition to the Doctor of Chiropractic degree. For more information on the bachelor's program, see the Undergraduate Studies section of this catalog. 39 TUITION AND FEES The College establishes all tuition and fees. Contact the Student Administrative Services Office Monday through Friday between the hours of 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. with questions about tuition and fees. Student loan checks and any other financial aid received by the College shall be used to cover all tuition and fees assessed for the current term and for additional fees as agreed upon in the tuition and fees agreement signed by the student. The College will accept checks by mail that are postmarked by the tuition deadline. The College reserves the right to modify or change requirements, rules, tuition and fees. Historically, the College has found it necessary to increase tuition annually to meet the rising cost of higher education. Students will be given notice of such modifications or changes prior to the changes taking effect. Changes to tuition and fees will be posted on the College website, palmer.edu. PROMISE TO PAY As a student, you understand that when you register for any class at Palmer College of Chiropractic, you accept full responsibility to pay all tuition, fees and other associated costs assessed as a result of your registration. Further, you understand and agree that your registration and acceptance of these terms con - stitutes a promissory note agreement (i.e., a financial obligation in the form of an educational loan as defined by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code at 11 U.S.C. \u00a7523(a)(8)) in which Palmer College of Chiropractic is providing you educational services, deferring some or all of your payment obligation for those services, and you promise to pay for all assessed tuition, fees and other associated costs by the published due date, the tenth day of the academic term. You understand and agree that if you drop or withdraw from some or all of the classes for which you register, you will be responsible for paying all or a portion of tuition and fees in accordance with the published tui - tion refund schedule at Palmer College of Chiropractic. You agree that you have read the terms and conditions of the published tuition refund schedule and under - stand those terms are incorporated herein by reference. You further understand that your failure to attend class or receive a bill does not absolve you of your financial responsibility as described above. PAYMENT OF FEES Tuition and fees are due in full by the 10th day of classes. Acceptable forms of tuition payment include cash, check, Heartland Payment Systems direct draw from a checking or savings account, Heartland Payment Systems credit card transaction, or a bank wire transfer. Check payment, direct debit and wire transfers must be drawn from a U.S. bank. A 2.75% transaction fee is accessed to all credit card payments through Hearland Payment Systems at the time of the transaction. Payments by check should be made payable to Palmer College of Chiropractic, indicate your student ID on the check, and send it to the address indicated on the College billing statement before the payment deadline. Checks from international countries must be payable through a United States bank in U.S. dollars. TUITION DELINQUENCY AND DEFERMENT DEFERMENT BY DUE DATE For certain approved loans, the due date for tuition is deferred when students sign an agreement in the Student Administrative Services Office, and if the loans conform to all of the following conditions: The loan will completely cover the unpaid balance of tuition. The loan was procured through the Financial Planning Office or from a foreign government. The approval of the loan was presented to the Financial Planning Office (if procured through that office) or to the Student Administrative Services Office (if procured from a foreign government) on or before the 10th day of classes. The tuition due date for such students is as agreed upon in the tuition and fees deferment agreement. The term \"loan\" shall also include grants in which the College is the recipient of the checks(s). 40 TUITION DELIQUENCY AND IT'S time. E-bill information is available via the students CONSEQUENCES Palmer Portal. Any student who hasn't paid his/her tuition in full on or before the 10th day of classes, or has not completed the payment agreement, is considered delinquent. Delinquent students are assessed a finance charge and may be removed from the class roll. Reinstatement will be determined by Student Administrative Services. All balances unpaid 30 days from the date of service will be assessed a 1% per month (12% annual rate) finance charge on the unpaid balance. There will be no exceptions. Tuition and fees are due in full by the 10th day of classes. If students do not plan to pay in full by the 10th day of classes, a payment agreement must be completed and returned by that date. Failure to complete such an agreement could result in removal from the class roll and restriction from registration for future academic terms. Students will not be given time credit for class attendance until their tuition is paid in full. Collection Agency Fees: If you fail to pay your student account bill or any monies due and owed to Palmer College of Chiropractic by the scheduled due date, and fail to make acceptable payment arrangements to bring your account current, Palmer College of Chiropractic may refer your delinquent account to a collection agency. You are responsible for paying the collection agency fee which will become due and owing upon placement of your account with a collection agency and may be based on a percentage at a maximum of 50% of your delinquent account, together with all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, necessary for the collection of your delinquent account. Should your account be referred to a collection agency, your delinquent account may be reported to one or more of the national credit bureaus. STUDENT BILLING ACCOUNTS Method of Billing: Palmer College of Chiropractic uses electronic billing (e-bill) as its official billing method, and therefore you are responsible for viewing and paying your student account e-bill by the scheduled due date. Failure to review your e-bill does not constitute a valid reason for not paying your bill on Billing Errors: Administrative, clerical or technical billing errors do not absolve you of your financial responsibility to pay the correct amount of tuition, fees and other associated financial obligations assessed as a result of your registration at Palmer College of Chiropractic. Returned Payments/Failed Payment Agreements: If a payment made to your student account is returned by the bank for any reason, you agree to repay the original amount of the payment plus a returned payment fee of $25. Multiple returned payments and/ or failure to comply with the terms of any payment plan or agreement you sign with Palmer College of Chiropractic may result in cancellation of your registration and/or suspension of your eligibility to register for future classes at Palmer College of Chiropractic. In the event a payment is dishonored due to insufficient funds or otherwise, you are responsible for all dishonored payments, including dishonored payments made by third parties to whom have made a payment on your behalf. The College is not responsible for any overdraft or other bank charges incurred by you as a result of an online payment authorization you establish. Student Refund Checks: Financial aid funds received are first credited to your billing account to pay for current charges. Once charges are paid, any additional loan funds are disbursed directly to the student either via direct deposit to your bank account or via a paper check if direct deposit information has not been provided. Paper checks must be picked up within 21 days of processing or the check will be voided, and the amount of those funds returned to your lender. FINANCIAL AID Aid described as \"estimated\" on your financial aid offer does not represent actual or guaranteed payment but is an estimate of the aid you may receive if you meet all requirements stipulated by that aid program. Your financial aid award is contingent upon your continued enrollment and attendance in each class upon which financial aid eligibility was calculated. If you drop any class before completion, you understand 41 that your financial aid eligibility may decrease and some or all of the financial aid awarded to you may be revoked. If some or all of your financial aid is revoked because you dropped or failed to attend class, you agree to repay all revoked aid that was disbursed to your account and resulted in a credit balance that was refunded to you. You agree to allow financial aid you receive to pay any and all charges assessed to your account at Palmer College of Chiropractic such as tuition, fees, service fees, fines, bookstore charges, clinical expenses or any other amount, in accordance with the terms of the aid. Federal Aid: Federal Title IV financial aid that you receive, except for Federal Work Study wages, will be credited to your account and used to pay current charges. Title IV financial aid includes aid from the Pell Grant, Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG), Direct Loan, and PLUS Loan programs. You authorize Palmer College of Chiropractic to apply your Title IV financial aid to other charges assessed to your student account such as bookstore charges, service fees and fines, and any other education related charges. You further understand that this authorization will remain in effect until you rescind it and that you may withdraw it at any time by contacting the Student Administrative Services office. Prizes, Awards, Scholarships and Grants: All prizes, awards, scholarships and grants awarded to you by Palmer College of Chiropractic will be credited to your student account and applied toward any outstanding balance. Receipt of a prize, award, scholarship or grant is considered a financial resource according to federal Title IV financial aid regulations, and may therefore reduce your eligibility for other federal and/or state financial aid (i.e., loans, grants, Federal Work Study) which, if already disbursed to your student account, must be reversed and returned to the aid source. TUITION REFUNDS The College must engage its faculty, carry on its administrative functions, provide the physical plant and the laboratories and make other financial plans to correspond with the number of students enrolled. When students withdraw from the College or drop a course, they leave a vacancy that cannot be filled that academic term. The following rules concerning refunds protect the College and its commitment to other students from losses when students withdraw or drop a course. Exceptions will be made only under emergency conditions determined by the College. REFUND POLICY Palmer College of Chiropractic's Refund Policy for withdrawals is calculated using the official withdrawal date to pro-rate aid as well as tuition and refundable charges through the 60% point in the term. This is based on calendar days from the first day of the term through the last scheduled day of the term, including weekends and midterm breaks of less than five days. After the 60% point in the term, financial aid will not be reduced for any withdrawal, nor will any refund of tuition or other refundable charges be granted. This policy applies to all College withdrawals whether student initiated or administrative withdrawals. Financial aid awarded (if any) will be returned to the federal, state and/or Palmer programs on a pro rata basis through the 60% point in the term. Outside scholarship or non-federal loan assistance will not be returned unless specifically requested by the provider. Eligible charges due or paid will be refunded on a pro rata basis through the 60% point in the term. For students not borrowing federal funds, any amount due to the student will be refunded within 30 days from the date the College determines the student's withdrawal. FEDERAL RETURN OF TITLE IV FUNDS REFUND POLICY Institutions are required to determine the percentage of Title IV financial aid \"earned\" by the student and to return the unearned portion to the appropriate federal student aid program when a student withdraws from the College. This calculation process is based on the number of days the student attended as outlined in the Federal Return of Title IV Funds Procedure below. Title IV funds are awarded to a student under the assumption that the student will attend school for the entire period for which the assistance is awarded. This calculation is based on the number of days the student attended as outlined in the Return of Federal Financial Aid Funds Process below determining \"earned\" versus \"unearned\" aid. 42 FEDERAL RETURN OF TITLE IV FUNDS PROCEDURE The return of financial aid funds policy follows these steps: 1. Determine the percentage of the enrollment period completed by the student. If the calculated percentage is equal to or greater than 60%, the student has \"earned\" all aid for the enrollment period and no adjustment in financial aid occurs. The refund amount is calculated by using the first calendar day of the academic term as the first day of attendance. Days Attended \u00f7 Days in Enrollment Period = Percentage Completed 2. Apply the percentage completed to the Title IV aid awarded to determine the student's eligibility for financial aid prior to the withdrawal. Total Aid Disbursed x Percentage Completed = Earned Aid 3. Determine the amount of unearned financial aid to be returned to the appropriate Title IV financial aid program. Total Disbursed Aid - Earned Aid = Unearned Aid to be Returned If the aid already disbursed equals the earned aid, no further action is required. If the aid already disbursed is less than the earned aid, a late disbursement will be made to the student. If the aid already disbursed is greater than the earned aid, the difference must be returned to the appropriate Title IV aid program. 4. Distribute the responsibility to return funds between the institution and the student. The return of federal financial aid is based on the type of financial aid disbursed and occurs in the following order: Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan Direct Subsidized Stafford Loan Direct PLUS Loan (for graduate students) Direct PLUS Loan (for parents of undergraduate students) Pell Grant FSEOG Student If the type of financial aid the student is responsible for returning is a loan, the student is typically not required to immediately repay the amount since the grace period for the loan (generally six months) is invoked. Occasionally, a loan must be fully cancelled and the loan amount will appear on the student's billing account. A loan repayment grace period for Federal loans will begin on the day of the student's withdrawal from Palmer College of Chiropractic. Students should contact their lender if they have questions regarding their grace period or repayment status. For examples regarding the application of the Return of Title IV Funds procedures, the student should contact the Office of Financial Planning. For students not borrowing federal funds, any amount due to the student will be refunded within 30 days from the date the College determines the student's withdrawal. TIMEFRAME FOR RETURNING FUNDS The institution must return its share of unearned Title IV funds no later than 45 days after it determines that the student withdrew. Notification to the student will be sent stating what the institution will be returning and their obligations. Students return their share of unearned aid attributable to a loan under the terms and conditions of the loan promissory note. Students have 45 days once notified to resolve any grant overpayment by one of the following two ways: 1. Repay the overpayment in full to the institution; or 2. Sign a repayment agreement with the institution. If a student refuses to make payment or payment arrangements on any Title IV program, Palmer College of Chiropractic is required to report the overpayment to the Department of Education. POST-WITHDRAWAL DISBURSEMENTS A student who earned more aid than was disbursed prior to withdrawal could be due a post-withdrawal disbursement. Disbursements must be made from available grant funds before loans. Palmer College of Chiropractic will contact a withdrawn student prior to making a post-withdrawal disbursement of loan funds to determine if those funds are still required by the student, and if so explain the student's obligation to repay those funds. Any portion of a post-withdrawal 43 disbursement not credited to the student's account will be offered (in writing or electronically) as a cash disbursement to the student within 30 days of the withdrawal date. The student has 14 calendar days to respond to the Office of Financial Planning. Palmer College of Chiropractic will return the post-withdrawal disbursement to the Department of Education if no response is received with the 14-day timeframe or funds are declined by the student (or parent in the case of a Parent PLUS loan). WITHDRAWALS Students who withdraw from the College may experience a reduction in their financial aid and may be required to refund or repay a portion of their financial aid. Regardless of payment source for tuition, the process for determining if and how much aid or funds returned to the student may need to be repaid can be found under the Federal Return of Title IV Funds Procedures section. If a student withdraws, the College is responsible for notifying the student's Federal loan lender of the date of the withdrawal via the National Student Loan Clearinghouse. The student is responsible for notifying the private or alternative loan lender of the date of the withdrawal. A loan repayment grace period for Federal loans will begin on the day of the student's withdrawal from the College. Students should contact their lender if they have questions regarding their grace period or repayment status. For information on withdrawal procedures, refer to Withdrawal from the College within the Academic Affairs section. UNOFFICIAL WITHDRAWALS Per federal regulations, schools are required to review students who received federal financial aid and did not pass any courses. An assessment must be made to determine whether the student earned the non-passing grades while attending classes or stopped attending classes but did not officially withdraw. Students who stopped attending classes may be required to repay a portion of the federal financial aid for that academic term. If it is determined that a student never began attendance in some or all courses, aid may be cancelled completely. Federal financial aid recipients who are not attending class are identified at the term midpoint by course instructors. If a student is identified as not attending one or more courses, they will receive an email from the Registrar outlining the College's policy on official and unofficial withdrawals. Students no longer attending class are encouraged to officially drop individual courses or withdraw entirely from the College through the Office of the Registrar. If a student follows College procedures and withdraws officially, they will have an official withdrawal date and their financial aid refund calculation will be completed according to the Federal Return of Title IV Funds Procedure stated. At the end of each term, all federal financial aid recipients who receive no passing grades (any combination of F, I, or W) will be reviewed to determine if the non-passing grade was earned while attending or due to no longer attending class. The Registrar will contact each course instructor to determine the last date of attendance or academic activity. Students will also be given the opportunity to provide documentation of attendance or academic activity. The midpoint of the academic term is used to calculate the amount of federal financial aid refund the student owes unless a later date of academic activity can be verified by the student or instructor. If no attendance or academic activity can be verified by the instructor or student, it will be assumed the student did not ever attend the class. If half-time attendance or academic activity cannot be verified, all aid may be cancelled. If academic activity beyond the midpoint of the academic term can be verified in even a single course by the student or an instructor and it can be verified the student began attendance in all courses, the amount of financial aid the student is required to repay may be reduced. If academic activity beyond the 60% point of the academic term can be verified in even a single course by the student or an instructor and the student began attendance in all courses, the student may not need to repay any financial aid. If a student unofficially withdraws, any refund owed to a federal financial aid program is the student's responsibility and will appear as a charge on the 44 student's billing account. Students with outstanding balances on their billing account cannot register for classes, and cannot receive official transcripts. DROPPING COURSES REFUND POLICY Dropping a course is defined as removing one or more, but not all, courses currently enrolled in. The College will refund 100% of institutional charges for the period of enrollment for which the student was charged if a student drops a course or courses on or before the end of the last day of student registration, 5th day of the academic term. The College will refund at least 50% of the tuition charges if the student drops a course or courses between the end of the add/drop period and the end of the first 25% (in time) of the period of enrollment for which the student was charged. The College will refund at least 25% of the tuition charges if the student drops a course or courses between the end of the first 25% (in time) and the end of the first 50% (in time) of the period of enrollment for which the student was charged.

STUDENT TUITION RECOVERY FUND The state of California requires that the following information is included in the College catalog: The state of California established the Student Tuition Recovery Fund (STRF) to relieve or mitigate economic loss suffered by a student in an educational program at a qualifying institution, who is or was a California resident while enrolled, or was enrolled in a residency program, if the student enrolled in the institution, prepaid tuition, and suffered an economic loss. Unless relieved of the obligation to do so, you must pay the state-imposed assessment for the STRF, or it must be paid on your behalf, if you are a student in an educational program, who is a California resident, or are enrolled in a residency program, and prepay all or part of your tuition. You are not eligible for protection from the STRF and you are not required to pay the STRF assessment, if you are not a California resident, or are not enrolled in a residency program. It is important that you keep copies of your enrollment agreement, financial aid documents, receipts, or any other information that documents the amount paid to the school. Questions regarding the STRF may be directed to the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education, 1747 North Market Blvd., Suite 225, Sacramento, CA 95834, 916-431-6959 or 888-370-7589. To be eligible for STRF, you must be a California resident or are enrolled in a residency program, prepaid tuition, paid or deemed to have paid the STRF assessment, and suffered an economic loss as a result of any of the following: 1. The institution, a location of the institution, or an educational program offered by the institution was closed or discontinued, and you did not choose to participate in a teach-out plan approved by the Bureau or did not complete a chosen teach-out plan approved by the Bureau. 2. You were enrolled at an institution or a location of the institution within the 120 day period before the closure of the institution or location of he institution, or were enrolled in an educational program within the 120 day period before the program was discontinued. 3. You were enrolled at an institution or a location of the institution more than 120 days before the closure of the institution or location of the institution, in an educational program offered by the institution as to which the Bureau determined there was a significant decline in the quality or value of the program more than 120 days before closure. 4. The institution has been ordered to pay a refund by the Bureau but has failed to do so. 5. The institution has failed to pay or reimburse loan proceeds under a federal student loan program as required by law or, has failed to pay or reimburse proceeds received by the institution in excess of tuition and other costs. 6. You have been awarded restitution, a refund, or other monetary award by an arbitrator or court, based on a violation of this chapter by an institution or representative of an institution, but have been unable to collect the award from the institution. 7. You sought legal counsel that resulted in the cancellation of one or more of your student loans and have an invoice for services rendered and evidence of the cancellation of the student loan or loans. To qualify for STRF reimbursement, the application must be received within four (4) years from the date of the action or event that made the student eligible for recovery from STRF . A student whose loan is revived by a loan holder or debt collector after a period of noncollection may, at any time, file a written application for recovery from STRF for the debt that would have otherwise been eligible for recovery. If it has been more than four (4) years since the action or event that made the student eligible, the student must have a filed a written application for recovery within the original four (4) year period, unless the period has been extended by another act of law. However, no claim can be paid to any student without a Social Security number or a taxpayer identification number. 47 FINANCIAL AID/SCHOLARSHIPS Palmer College of Chiropractic assists students and their families as fully as possible to finance their educational expenses. All degree-seeking students may apply for financial aid. All student financial aid is administered by and coordinated through the Financial Planning Office. Students applying for financial aid must be officially accepted for admission before any financial aid can be awarded. Students must maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) in order to retain federal and institutional financial aid eligibility. FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID U.S. citizens and eligible non-citizens are required to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) each year they seek federal financial aid. The information provided is used to create an analysis of each student's financial ability to contribute toward his or her educational costs. Students may complete the FAFSA application at https://studentaid.gov. Palmer's school code is 012300. The Office of Financial Planning may require other forms in addition to the FAFSA to determine financial aid eligibility. There is no deadline to apply for financial aid, and students can apply throughout the academic year, however some resources are limited and awarded on a first come-first served basis. Students are encouraged to apply and complete their financial aid documents as soon as possible. Prior to beginning enrollment at the College, and each award year (July 1-June 30) following, students will receive an offer from the Office of Financial Planning. This notice discloses the student's expense budget for the upcoming year and an offer of financial aid to assist in covering expenses. Palmer utilizes a passive acceptance model for financial aid. If there are no modifications or cancellations requested by the student at the time of the offer letter, the financial aid offer is considered accepted and will be disbursed accordingly. FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID ELIGIBILITY To be eligible for federal aid a student must: Be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen; Complete the FAFSA Have a valid Social Security number (unless you are from the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia or the Republic of Palau); Have a high school diploma or a General Education Development (GED) certificate or pass an exam approved by the U.S. Department of Education; Be enrolled or accepted for enrollment as a regular student working toward a degree; Demonstrate financial need (except for certain loans); Maintain satisfactory academic progress as defined by the College; Not be in default on any loan or owe a refund on any grant made to you under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 at this or any other institution; and Certify that you will use federal student aid only for educational purposes. Some financial aid programs, including Federal Work-Study, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (undergraduate students only) and Direct Subsidized loans are need-based student financial aid programs. Under each program, the College must determine whether or not a student has financial \"need\". The College determines a student's financial need by subtracting their Expected Family Contribution (EFC) which is the amount the student may reasonably be expected to contribute toward the student's educational cost from the student's cost of attendance budget. The Financial Planning Office also considers outside sources of aid or benefits (such as scholarships, fee waivers and tuition reimbursement) in determining the student's financial need. Eligibility is determined by completion of the FAFSA. Annual loan limits are awarded over an academic year (nine months or three quarters for our quarter based curriculums on our Port Orange, Florida, and San Jose, California, campuses, and eight months or two trimesters for our trimester based curriculums on our Davenport, Iowa and Port Orange, Florida campuses) while campus-based programs are awarded on a 12-month basis. 48 FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID APPLICATION PROCESS New Applicants Prospective students should complete the steps to apply for financial aid before they are officially admitted to the College, however, financial aid will not be awarded until the student is officially admitted. Renewal All continuing students must reapply for financial aid annually. Renewable financial aid is conditionally based on a student's ability to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) and financial aid eligibility. For continuing students, the act of not modifying the financial aid offered is interpreted as acceptance on the student's part. Financial aid award letters are emailed to students to their College email account. Students must notify the Office of Financial Planning in writing to make a change to their financial aid. FAFSA To apply for federal financial aid, complete the steps below: Step 1: Complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) by using \"FAFSA on the Web\" at https://studentaid.gov. The information submitted on the FAFSA is used to evaluate a student's ability to contribute towards their cost of attendance. When you enter a school code of 012300 a copy of the results will be sent to the College. Step 2: Complete the online loan entrance counseling at https://studentaid.gov. This process informs the student of aid terms, rights and responsibilities and repayment information. Borrowing a student loan is a serious financial obligation, and the entrance counseling will provide you with the important information you need to know to be able to make an informed decision about student loan borrowing. Step 3: Complete and sign the electronic Master Promissory Note (MPN) at https://studentaid.gov. The MPN is a legal document in which you promise to repay your loan(s) and any accrued interest and fees to the U.S. Department of Education. It also explains the term and conditions of you loan(s). FAFSA Results After the federal processor has processed a student's FAFSA, the student will receive a Student Aid Report (SAR). This summarizes the information on the student's FAFSA and indicates the Expected Family Contribution (EFC), the amount the family is expected to contribute towards the student's educational expenses for the year. The Office of Financial Planning will receive the FAFSA results a long as the student has listed the College on the FAFSA with school code 012300. SUBMITTING DOCUMENTS TO THE OFFICE OF FINANCIAL PLANNING Financial aid cannot be awarded until a student's financial aid file is complete. During the financial aid process, the student may be asked to submit additional information in order to process financial aid. Failure to turn in all requested documents to the Office of Financial Planning by the specified deadline in the request may result in the loss of financial aid for which the student may otherwise have been eligible. A student may be selected for verification. Verification is an additional level of scrutiny required by the federal government and provides specific documents verifying income, family size, or other data. When this occurs, the student will be notified via the SAR and the Office of Financial Planning will contact the student to obtain the necessary documentation. Financial aid cannot be awarded until a student's financial aid file is complete. TYPES OF FINANCIAL AID Direct Unsubsidized Loans The student borrower is required to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) in order to qualify for the award and must complete additional federal and institutional requirements prior to disbursement of the award. This loan is not based on financial need and is available to all eligible students. The U.S. Department of Education limits the amount of funds a student can borrow annually and over a lifetime. The limit is based on the student borrower's degree program, amount of credits earned toward the degree and dependency status. The interest rate varies annually, but once the loan is disbursed, the interest rate is fixed for the life of the loan. There is also a loan origination fee. The student borrower is responsible for the interest that accrues from the time the funds are disbursed until the loan is 49 paid in full. There is a six-month grace period before repayment (after the borrower graduates, leaves school or drops below half-time enrollment). Direct PLUS Loans for Graduate Professional Students (GradPLUS) GradPLUS loans are provided by the U.S. Department of Education to graduate/professional students to pay unmet educational expenses. They may also be used as an alternative to private student loans. The student borrower is required to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) in order to qualify for the award and must complete additional federal and institutional requirements prior to disbursement of the award. The interest rate varies annually but once the loan is disbursed the interest rate is fixed for the life of the loan. There is also a loan origination fee. The student borrower is subject to a credit check and the credit check must not result in an adverse credit decision. There is no grace period. In-school deferment is available to postpone payments for borrowers who are enrolled at least half-time. STUDENT EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM The Student Employment Program is designed to provide employment opportunities for eligible students to help finance their College expenses. Job openings are advertised on campus and students may apply if they are enrolled in classes at least half-time and are making satisfactory academic progress. The maximum yearly work-study award is determined by the Financial Planning Office. SCHOLARSHIPS Palmer College of Chiropractic scholarships and grants recognize students with outstanding academic performance, exceptional financial need, extracurricular contributions to the College, and chiropractic community and/or other criteria. Scholarships are made available to students annually through donations or internally generated funds. Descriptions, applications and deadlines for available scholarships are advertised each term by the Financial Planning Office. Palmer College students are encouraged to apply. All scholarships and grants are considered to be part of a student's financial aid award package. FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS - UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS ONLY FEDERAL PELL GRANT - UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS ONLY A Federal Pell Grant, unlike a loan, does not have to be repaid. The award amount depends on the student's financial need, costs to attend school, status as a full-time or part-time student, and plans to attend school for a full fiscal year or less. Students holding a bachelor's degree are not eligible. FEDERAL SUPPLEMENTAL EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY GRANT (FSE0G) A FSEOG award is reserved for undergraduate students with exceptional financial need. Federal Pell Grant recipients with the lowest Expected Family Contribution (EFC) will be considered first for a FSEOG award. Similar to the Pell grant, the FSEOG does not have to be repaid. DIRECT SUBSIDIZED LOANS - UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS ONLY The student borrower is required to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) in order to qualify for the award and must complete additional federal and institutional requirements prior to disbursement of the award. Eligibility is based on financial need as determined by the FAFSA. The U.S. Department of Education limits the amount of funds a student can borrow annually and over a lifetime. The limit is based on the student borrower's degree program, amount of credits earned toward the degree and dependency status. The interest rate varies annually but once the loan is disbursed the interest rate is fixed for the life of the loan. There is also a loan origination fee. The student borrower does not pay interest that accrues while the student is in school at least half-time. Interest begins accruing and is the student borrower's responsibility to pay once the student drops below half-time status, withdraws from classes or graduates. There is a six-month grace period before repayment (after the borrower graduates, leaves school or drops below half-time enrollment). 50 DIRECT PLUS LOANS FOR PARENTS OF UNDERGRADUATES (PARENT PLUS) Parent PLUS loans are provided by the U.S. Department of Education to parents of dependent students to cover educational costs. Parent PLUS loans may be borrowed in addition to or instead of the federal subsidized and federal unsubsidized loans. The interest rate varies annually but once the loan is disbursed the interest rate is fixed for the life of the loan. There is also a loan origination fee. The parent borrower is subject to a credit check and the credit check must not result in an adverse credit decision. There is no grace period. Repayment begins 60 days after the loan funds are fully disbursed. There may be forbearance options available to postpone repayment while the student for whom the loan was borrowed is enrolled at least half-time. Borrowers should contact their loan servicer for details. SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS (SAP) The Financial Planning Office is required by federal regulations to monitor that all enrolled students are making Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) towards completion of their degree. All students are monitored for SAP regardless of their eligibility or intent to receive financial aid. A student who does not meet the SAP requirements may lose eligibility to receive Federal Title IV aid including the Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), Federal Direct Loans (subsidized or unsubsidized), Federal Direct PLUS Loans, Federal Work-Study and all sources of institutional aid including endowed and gift scholarships. A new student is considered to be meeting SAP requirements upon admission into a degree program. The academic records of all students are reviewed at the end of every term to determine if SAP requirements are being met. All periods of a student's enrollment, whether or not the student received aid, are included in the SAP review. A student who does not meet any one of the eligibility criteria (stated below) is determined to not be making SAP towards completion of their degree. Students may continue to receive financial aid by meeting all of the following criteria which have been established as the minimum standards for making SAP. SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Minimum cumulative grade point average requirement: A student must maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) to retain financial aid eligibility. A minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0 must be earned for all undergraduate students and students in the Doctor of Chiropractic Program. Transfer: A transfer student's GPA earned on classes accepted for transfer credit toward degree requirements is not included in the calculation of cumulative GPA. Minimum cumulative pace requirement (credit hour completion rate): The cumulative rate of credit hours successfully completed as a percentage of cumulative credit hours attempted is a measure of the pace at which a student is progressing toward a degree. A student must successfully complete at least 67% of cumulative attempted hours by the end of each term. A student is deemed to have successfully completed a course in which a grade of A, B, C or P is earned. Credits attempted will be the total of those credits for which a student is registered at the conclusion of the add/drop period as defined by the College. Transfer: Credits accepted by Palmer toward degree requirements are included as both credit hours successfully completed and credit hours attempted in the calculation of pace. Maximum time frame requirement: The maximum number of credit hours allowable to complete a degree is 150% of the credit hours normally required to complete the degree program. Transfer: Credits accepted by Palmer toward degree requirements are included in the computation of maximum time frame. ACADEMIC STANDING A student who meets the above criteria but is placed on Academic Warning, Academic Probation or Academic Management Contract by the Academic Standing Committee does not meet the SAP requirements. 51 TREATMENT OF COURSE WITHDRAWALS, INCOMPLETES, REPEATED COURSES AND ELECTIVES Withdrawals (W or AW): Courses dropped before the conclusion of the add/drop period that no longer appear on the student's transcript will not count as a course attempted. Courses dropped after the add/drop period for which the student receives a \"W\" or \"AW\" grade, will count as a course attempted. Incompletes (I): If a student has an incomplete grade in a course at the time of SAP review and the outcome of the grade in that course will affect whether or not a student meets the SAP eligibility criteria, the student record will not be reviewed for SAP, and financial aid will be on hold until the incomplete grade has been processed into a final grade. Repeated courses: For courses repeated, only the most recent grade is included in the cumulative GPA. All repeated courses will be included in attempted hours. Electives: Elective classes that are not counted towards a student's degree program are not included in the SAP review. This includes bachelor classes taken while enrolled in the Doctor of Chiropractic Program. If an elective is a part of the degree program requirements, it will be included in the SAP review. SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS STATUSES Financial Aid Eligible: This status is assigned to a student who meets the SAP eligibility criteria. A student with this assigned status is eligible to receive financial aid. Financial Aid Warning: A student that does not meet the SAP eligibility criteria is placed on Financial Aid Warning for the term following the deficiency. A student is eligible to receive financial aid during the warning period. At the end of the warning period, a student's performance will be reviewed against the SAP eligibility criteria and if found to be in compliance will be assigned the Financial Aid Eligible status. If a student again does not meet the SAP eligibility criteria (including the repetition of an Academic Warning status) the student will have the opportunity to appeal. See the section titled \"Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeals.\" Financial Aid Probation: A student who has been placed on Financial Aid Warning status and does not meet the SAP eligibility criteria at the end of that term, but who submits a SAP appeal that is granted by the Financial Aid Appeals Committee, is considered to be on Financial Aid Probation for the following term. A student is eligible to receive financial aid during the probation period. At the end of the probation period, a student's performance will be reviewed against the SAP eligibility criteria and if found to be in compliance will be assigned the Financial Aid Eligible status. If a student does not meet the SAP eligibility criteria, the student will be placed on the Financial Aid Termination status. Financial Aid Termination: A student who does not meet the SAP eligibility criteria at the conclusion of the Financial Aid Warning period and who either fails to appeal or has the appeal denied will be placed on Financial Aid Termination. Additionally, a student who does not meet the SAP eligibility criteria at the conclusion of the Financial Aid Probation period will be placed on Financial Aid Termination. Financial aid cannot be received while on this status. In order to return to Financial Aid Eligible status, the student must correct the identified deficiencies. SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS APPEALS A student who does not meet the SAP eligibility criteria at the conclusion of the term in which the student was put on a Financial Aid Warning status may file a written appeal. The student must clearly explain the extenuating circumstances as to why the SAP eligibility criteria was not met and provide proper documentation to support the extenuating circumstances. Circumstances may include (but are not limited to) significant medical issues or death of an immediate family member. The appeal must also include an explanation of what has changed in the student's situation that will allow the student to demonstrate satisfactory academic progress at the next evaluation. Students will have the option of attending/enrolling in classes when an appeal is necessary. However, financial aid eligibility will not be calculated and released unless the appeal is approved. If the appeal is denied, the student is responsible for any balance owed to the College. The appeal must be submitted to the Financial Planning Office by the deadline 52 specified by the department. The Financial Aid Appeals Committee will evaluate the merits of the appeal by reviewing the documentation submitted as well as the student's previous academic performance at Palmer. The Committee may request additional information or documentation as needed and will advise the student of the final determination. An appeal will only be granted if it can be determined that the student will be able to meet SAP eligibility criteria after the subsequent period. If it is determined that circumstances beyond the student's control prohibit the student from making SAP, at the Committee's discretion, an academic plan may be developed with the student to ensure that the student is able to meet SAP eligibility criteria by a specific point in time. SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES Academic Program Change: After a student begins enrollment in an academic program, the student may switch to another academic program offered by the College. Any credits accepted towards the new academic program degree requirements will be included in the calculation of cumulative pace and maximum time frame and excluded from the calculation of cumulative GPA. Re-Entry after Withdrawal: A student requesting re- entry into the College will return with the SAP status calculated at the time of withdrawal. NOTIFICATION Only students not meeting all satisfactory academic progress eligibility criteria will be notified by the Financial Planning Office. STUDENTS' FINANCIAL AID/ SCHOLARSHIP RESPONSIBILITIES Students have the following responsibilities regarding financial aid/scholarship programs: To review and consider all information about financial aid programs before enrollment. To complete all application forms accurately and submit them on time to the Financial Planning Office as well as to student loan servicers. Errors can result in delays in receipt of financial aid. Intentional misreporting of information on application forms for federal financial aid is a violation of the law and is considered a criminal offense subject to penalties under the U.S. Criminal Code. To return all additional documentation, verification, corrections and new information requested by either the Financial Planning Office or the agency to which the application was submitted. To read and understand all forms required for financial aid and keep copies of same.

To be eligible to transfer, students must have met the CCE prerequisites at the time of enrollment at their transferring institution, and possess a doctoral-level health profession program cumulative grade point average of 2.50 or better. Requests for transfer below 2.50 cumulative grade point average will be reviewed and determined by the Academic Dean. To transfer and receive advanced placement, students must be in good academic and ethical standing and be eligible to re-matriculate to their transferring institution. Students dismissed from a chiropractic or doctoral-level health professional program are not eligible for transfer consideration. All transfer students are required to fulfill the procedures found in the Application Procedures section of this catalog. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS Each international student requesting transfer to Palmer College must first meet admissions requirements. Students admitted to begin the D.C. degree program on the basis of academic credentials from institutions outside the United States must meet the following requirements: 1. Provide evidence of proficiency in reading and writing English, and an understanding of oral communication in English, commensurate with the level of proficiency expectations established by the D.C. degree program for successful completion. 2. Provide evidence of completing 90 undergraduate semester hours, substantially equivalent to that completed by beginning students admitted from U.S. institutions, with no less than a 2.75 grade point average. 3. Provide evidence of proficiency in the subject matter of each course for which credits are accepted. 4. Provide evidence of having financial resources sufficient to complete at least one full calendar year of full-time attendance in the Doctor of Chiropractic degree program. 5. Meet all applicable legal requirements for study in the United States. ADVANCED STANDING Advanced standing may be granted to a student who completes a graduate-level course required by Palmer College of Chiropractic while attending another institution within the last five years. Graduate professional credits earned through an accredited graduate, medical, osteopathic college or CCE-member college may be used for advanced standing. Each course will be individually evaluated and credit will be granted only when approved by the College. For specific procedures and restrictions, contact the College Registrar. Once the applicant has acquired Advanced Standing Evaluation information from the Office Admissions/ Enrollment or campus Registrar, the following applies: The transferring student should provide course descriptions and any other documentation (syllabi) describing the course content for those courses in which advanced standing is requested. This information must be received by the Office of Admissions/Enrollment no later than one month prior to the beginning of enrollment. An official transcript of the course must be on file in the student's records. The request will be approved by the Dean for the appropriate grade, hours and course content. The student will then be notified of the results by email. For international transfers, credit from non-U.S. professional programs must be evaluated by the World Educational Services (WES), or equivalent transcript evaluator, before applying for transfer. Academic 63 work will be evaluated to determine that prerequisite admissions requirements are met. Courses used to meet prerequisite requirements are not eligible for advanced standing consideration. Once admissions requirements are met, evaluation for advanced standing credits will follow. TRANSFER STUDENT AND ADVANCED STANDING CRITERIA: The student must be in good academic and ethical standing at the transferring institution; Overall chiropractic or other doctoral-level cumulative GPA must be 2.50 or above. Requests to transfer below 2.50 cumulative grade point average will be reviewed and determined by the Academic Dean; Previous fulfillment of all CCE prerequisite admissions requirements; Transfer credits must be equivalent in credit hours, content and quality to that of Palmer College of Chiropractic; the earned grade is not transferred, and, thus, the course does not affect the student's grade point average at Palmer College of Chiropractic; Only credits with a grade of \"C\" or better are considered for transfer; Credits accepted for transfer must have been awarded within five years of the date of admission to Palmer College. Older credits in certain areas may be accepted if the transferring student holds an earned doctorate in one of the health sciences (e.g., D.C., M.D., D.O., D.D.S., D.P.M.) or a graduate degree in an academic discipline closely related to the health sciences; Credits used to satisfy the minimum prerequisites for admission may not be used for advanced placement credit; Each course will be individually evaluated and credit will be granted only when approved by the College; Palmer College transcripts will record transfer courses and credits as issued by the awarding institution, including the name of the awarding institution; Students transferring from another chiropractic program must complete the Chiropractic College Transfer Form available from the Office of Admissions/Enrollment; and Students will be placed according to their incoming educational profile (i.e. third term). In addition to awarding advanced standing credit, the College may offer credit by examination (see Credit by Examination). In order to receive a degree from Palmer College, a student must have satisfied all academic and clinical requirements, be in good ethical standing, and must have earned not less than the final 25% of the total credits required for the D.C. degree from Palmer College of Chiropractic, allowing up to 75% of the total credits through advanced standing. Students wishing to transfer from Palmer College of Chiropractic to another institution must contact that institution directly to determine whether Palmer credits will be accepted. As with any academic program, transferability of credit is at the discretion of the accepting institution. Students should inquire for further details directly to the Office of the Academic Dean. TRANSFERRING BETWEEN PALMER CAMPUSES Students requesting to transfer between Palmer College campuses must meet the same transfer and advanced standing criteria outlined above. The awarding of advanced standing credit varies across the three campuses due to the variation in academic term length, curricular structure and sequence of academic coursework. TRANSFERABILITY OF CREDITS NOTICE CONCERNING TRANSFERABILITY OF CREDITS AND CREDENTIALS EARNED AT OUR INSTITUTION The transferability of credits you earn at Palmer College of Chiropractic is at the complete discretion of an institution to which you may seek to transfer. Acceptance of the credits you earn in the Doctor of Chiropractic program is also at the complete discretion of the institution to which you may seek to transfer.

The schedule for preregistration will be GRADING SYSTEM Grades are assigned based on the grading system as follows: Quality Letter Interpretation Points Grade 4 A Passed with honors. 3 B Passed with above average performance. 2 C Passed (fulfilled the objectives of the course). R Failed with permission to take a remediation examination. This grade is applicable only per campus dean approval following assessment of curricular and local campus factors. All attendance requirements must have been met and the student enrolled in the course for the first time. Students are limited to three (3) course remediations during their academic tenure. An \"R\" grade option is not available for clinic courses. I Incomplete - Signifies that acceptable cause prevented the student from completely fulfilling the objectives of the course. Issuance of an \"I\" grade requires the student has met the following criteria: An acceptable cause prevented the student from completely fulfilling the course objectives; The student can earn a passing grade by completing the unfinished course objectives; and The student has completed at least 50% of the course activities by the final grade deadline date. When a grade of \"I\" incomplete is given, it must be completed by the last day of the first week of the following academic term. Failure to do so will result in the grade converting to a failure. Because of its convertibility, this grade carries indirect potential for dismissal. 0 F Failure - Signifies failure to fulfill the objectives of the course and carries academic dismissal potential. P, PH Pass/Pass Honors (without mention of quality of performance). Used only in courses with Pass/No Credit grading, achievement of advanced standing, or credit by examination. 66 W Withdrawal - Signifies that the student has officially withdrawn from the course on or before the College drop date of the academic term. Students are allowed to voluntarily withdraw from the same course twice without academic penalty. AW Administrative Withdrawal - Signifies that the College has withdrawn the student from the course. AF Attendance Failure - Signifies that the number of absences makes it impossible for the student to meet the attendance requirements and is equivalent to a failing grade. COURSE REMEDIATION APPLICABLE TO THE FLORIDA AND WEST CAMPUSES ONLY Eligibility and the issuance of an \"R\" grade requires the approval of the course instructor and the Dean of Academic Affairs. The student must have met the following criteria: first time enrolled in the course, next academic period. The student may choose not to register for that course or courses, however, non-registration in a failed course the subsequent term of enrollment may compromise academic standing and/ or eligibility for financial aid. Students are advised to discuss registration options with an academic advisor and/or financial aid advisor prior to making the decision to not register for a course with an outstanding failure. within 10% of the passing threshold of the course, and met all attendance requirements for the course. When a grade \"R\" is given, a remediation examination must be administered and graded by the last day of the first week of the following academic term and focus on the learning deficits as determined by the course instructor. A successful remediation will result in a grade \"C\" as the final course grade. Failure to do so will result in the \"R\" grade converting to a failure. Because of its convertibility, this grade carries potential for academic dismissal. Students are limited to three (3) course remediations during their academic tenure. RESTRICTIONS Students have the right to repeat any course. The last grade earned in that course is called the current grade and is substituted for the previously earned grade and a new GPA is computed. Each grade of failure remains as an active, outstanding failure on the student's record until a passing grade is achieved with sufficient attendance. If a student registers for any course in which the student has earned an incomplete grade, the student's registration automatically converts the incomplete grade to a failing grade. A student with any failing grade will be subject to automatic registration in that course or courses for the If a licensing jurisdiction will not accept a grade of \"P\" (passing), the College will use another letter grades for that course. CREDIT BY EXAMINATION A student may receive course credit by examination, at the discretion of each course instructor, if the following equivalent course guidelines are met: Prior course credits must be substantially equivalent in credit hours, content and quality to that of the College. Only courses that were awarded at the 300 level or above with a grade of \"C\" or better and awarded within five years of the date of admission to the College are considered for credit by examination eligibility. Older credits in certain areas may be accepted if the student holds an earned doctorate in one of the health sciences (e.g., D.C., M.D., D.O., D.D.S., and D.P.M.) or a graduate degree in an academic discipline closely related to the health sciences. Credits used to satisfy the minimum prerequisites for admission may not be used for credit by examination. The course must carry equivalent credit or contact hours equal to the course for which a credit by examination is granted. Each course will be individually evaluated by the course instructor and the Registrar. Upon successful eligibility determination, the instructor 67 will administer the appropriate competency examination. Upon successful exam completion, credit will be granted, as determined by criteria outlined by the course instructor and approved by the College. A grade \"P\" (passing) will be awarded, which will carry no quality points toward the student's G.P.A. If the credit by examination is unsuccessful, the student will complete the course as registered during the term. Students will not be given the opportunity to re-take an exam if unsuccessful. The credit by examination must be completed and the credit by examination form submitted to the College Registrar by noon on the first Friday of the academic term in which the student is registered for the course. Students being granted credit by examination are still required to register for the course. Tuition will not be charged for credits granted by examination. The student must have successfully completed all prerequisite courses to the course from which he/ she wishes to receive credit by examination. GRADE CHANGES If a student believes there is a discrepancy in the grade report, the student should immediately contact the course instructor. Grade changes may only reflect errors in computation or entry of grades. Challenges to a discrepancy in the grade report must be completed within one calendar year of the final grade report being issued. GRADE POINT AVERAGE In each course, a student earns grade points equal to the product of the course credits and the arithmetic value of the grade in that course. In turn, the student's academic term Grade Point Average (GPA) is derived by dividing the number of quality points accumulated in that academic term by the sum of credit hours for courses that carry quality points in that term. Incomplete, Passing, No Credit, Remediation, Withdrawal and Administrative Withdrawal hours are not included in the computation of grade point. A student's GPA is used as a measurement of satisfactory progress. Cumulative GPA is calculated by dividing the sum of all of the quality points earned in all academic terms by the sum of the credits carried with the latest quality grade in each course for courses that carry quality points. Students have the right to repeat all courses. The last earned grade is substituted for the previously earned grade and a new GPA is computed. GRADE REPORTS At the end of each academic term, the student can access an electronic grade report that contains: The grade in each course taken during that term The contact hours or credit hours earned in each course taken that term The GPA and its factors for that term The cumulative GPA and its factors The sum of the total earned contact hours and credit hours The original grade report is deposited in the student's file. ADD/DROP COURSES Any student wishing to add or drop courses must request an \"Add/Drop\" form from the Student Administrative Services Office. Students must officially drop a course on or before the College drop date of the academic term to avoid academic penalty. All course additions must be completed before the end of the first week of instruction in the term. Students wishing to add courses should be aware that attendance requirements need to be considered when adding a course after the first day of class. If a student's request to withdraw from a course(s) will result in the student being placed on an individualized schedule, the student must first meet with the Registrar or an advisor for academic advising. A grade of \"W\" will appear on the student's transcript and will count as a course attempted in the evaluation of satisfactory academic progress. Petitions to withdraw in extenuating circumstances after the respective campuses posted \"Last Day to Drop a Course\" date should be submitted to the Academic Dean. A student may only withdraw from any given course twice without academic penalty. 68 The Palmer College Satisfactory Academic Progress Standards for financial aid eligibility require that students are making progress towards completion of their degree. Withdrawal from courses may have a direct effect on loan eligibility during the next period of enrollment. Please refer to the Financial Aid Eligibility Requirements Policy, and address any questions regarding Title IV aid eligibility to the Director of Financial Planning. DEFINITION OF A CREDIT HOUR Palmer College of Chiropractic's policy, which is in compliance with the federal definition, is published on the College website, and states that every unit for which credit is given is understood to represent approximately three hours of actual work per week for the average student. COURSE PREREQUISITES AND MAINTENANCE A prerequisite represents a set of skills or a body of knowledge that a student must possess prior to enrollment in the course, and without which the student is highly unlikely to succeed. Prerequisite indicates a condition of enrollment that a student is required to meet in order to demonstrate current readiness for enrollment in a subsequent course. Students will not be permitted to enroll in such courses without the appropriate prerequisite. Current prerequisites are available at the Student Administrative Service Office or on the College website. The effect of prerequisite courses related to transfer credits and students receiving advanced standing will be managed by the Academic Affairs Office. Appeals to this policy may be made in writing to the Academic Dean no later than the fifth class day of an academic term. A student must have successfully completed all courses within an academic term before registering for any course(s) in an academic term more than two academic terms beyond. Example: In order to register for the fourth academic term, all courses from the first academic term must be successfully completed. ACADEMIC PROGRESS The College is required by federal regulations to monitor that all enrolled students are making satisfactory academic progress towards completion of their degree. All students are monitored regardless of their eligibility or intent to receive financial aid. Please refer to the detailed financial aid eligibility requirements in this catalog. ACADEMIC CREDIT LOAD The College defines a full-time student as one who is carrying a minimum full-time credit load as follows: Doctor of Chiropractic Degree Program: twelve (12) credit hours with half-time status being six (6)credit hours. Undergraduate Studies: twelve (12) credit hours with half-time status being six (6) credit hours. Palmer College also recognizes that not all students prefer or are able to handle the full-time academic load of a professional program. Some students may have difficulty in attending full-time and may need to extend their academic careers. Students choosing to extend their studies should refer to the Length of Time Allowed to Complete Academic Course of Study policy. Maximum Credit Load refers to the maximum number of course credit hours a student may register for during any one academic term. Students in good academic standing may register for a maximum of: Doctor of Chiropractic (D.C.) Degree Program: twenty-seven (27) credit hours in the core curriculum and up to two elective courses are allowed without prior approval from the Registrar. Students placed on academic probation or academic warning will be restricted to a maximum schedule of fifteen (15) credit hours for that academic term of enrollment. Any student wishing to take more than two elective courses must obtain permission from the Registrar. Bachelor of Science (B.S.) Completion Program: fifteen (15) credit hours without prior approval. Students placed on academic probation or academic warning will be restricted to a maximum schedule of twelve (12) credit hours for that academic term of enrollment. Students taking B.S. courses simultaneously with a full D.C. degree program credit load must have prior approval to take more than six undergraduate credit hours. 69 LENGTH OF TIME ALLOWED TO Undergraduate Program: twelve (12) credit hoursCOMPLETE ACADEMIC COURSE OF STUDY Doctor of Chiropractic (D.C.) Degree Program: A student must complete the entire D.C. degree course of study within eight calendar years of matriculation. Bachelor of Science (B.S.) Degree Program: Students who graduate from the D.C. degree program have one calendar year from the date of completion of the D.C. degree program, or one year from the date of withdrawal from the D.C. degree program, to complete all B.S. coursework and be awarded the B.S. degree. Students whose progress is such that they will be unable to complete their studies within the number of years indicated above will be dismissed. Dismissed students may appeal, in writing, to the Academic Dean. The Academic Dean's decision is final. ACADEMIC STANDING Academic guidelines provide direction for the student who demonstrates difficulty in completing course requirements. These guidelines are applied by the Academic Standing Committee, which seeks to ensure fairness and equity for students while ensuring competence of the graduates of the College. Students who fail to meet minimum academic expectations may be placed on academic warning, academic probation, academic management, or academic dismissal. ACADEMIC WARNING Students, regardless of Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA), are placed on academic warning for the following academic term of enrollment if they have two active failures and/or fail the same course twice. ACADEMIC PROBATION Students are placed on academic probation when their Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) falls below 2.00 at any point during their enrollment. RESTRICTED COURSE LOAD Students while on academic warning, probation or management contract will be limited to a course load maximum as follows: Doctor of Chiropractic Program: fifteen (15) credit hours Academic warning or probation is intended to encourage students to take all appropriate actions necessary to ensure academic success. Students on probation or warning are required to repeat all failed courses the following term of enrollment. Failure to do so may restrict course scheduling and negatively impact financial aid eligibility. ACADEMIC MANAGEMENT Students will be placed on an academic management contract if: 1. While on academic warning, they fail a class that they previously failed and have at least one additional active failure on their transcript; 2. They have failed an individual class for the third time, or; 3. After two consecutive terms on academic probation, the student fails to raise their CGPA to the minimal standard referenced above. Students placed on an academic management contract in the Doctor of Chiropractic Degree Program cannot be enrolled in undergraduate studies or elective courses at Palmer during the academic term(s) on contract. The terms of the management contract will be at the discretion of the Academic Standing Committee. Students failing to successfully complete all terms of the management contract will be dismissed from the institution. Successful completion of an academic management contract shall return a student to good academic standing. Any student who meets the criteria for a subsequent management contract will be academically dismissed. ACADEMIC SUSPENSION Students who qualified for a management contract but elect to take a term of absence from Palmer College receive a status of academic suspension. Upon re-enrolling, the student will be placed on a management contract. During terms of academic suspension, the student will be considered a non-enrolled student. This status allows access to College facilities, student academic support and academic tutorials. Non-enrolled students are not allowed to audit a course without written approval from the Academic Dean. 70 ACADEMIC DISMISSAL Students are dismissed from the institution if they fail an academic management contract. Students may appeal a dismissal, in writing, to the Academic Standing Committee. This appeal must be submitted to the Registrar by noon on the Monday of the second week of classes the following academic term. The committee will meet to hear appeals on the Tuesday of the second week of the academic term. The Academic Standing Committee may choose to: 1. Uphold dismissal; 2. Suspend the student for a minimum of one term with or without expectations to be met during their absence; or 3. Place a student on a second academic management contract. Upon notification of the appeal by the Academic Standing Committee that the dismissal is upheld or that the student has been suspended for a period of time, the student may no longer attend courses. The dismissed student may appeal in writing to the Academic Dean if they have evidence due process was not followed. The Dean's appeal decision is final. The student may apply for re-admission to the Academic Dean at a future date if there is significant evidence of sustained and substantial academic improvement since the date of the student's dismissal. Refer to the Re-Admission section. COURSE AUDIT Students may enroll to audit a course, on a space available basis, with written permission from the Academic Dean. Auditing may not be permitted in selected coursework. Audited courses do not count toward full-time status, grade point average, or financial aid eligibility. A student auditing a course will be registered for the course(s) they have been approved to audit. The student will not be required to submit assignments, take quizzes or exams, and request review of course work unless otherwise directed by the course instructor or the Academic Dean. Class participation is at the discretion of the course instructor, in consultation with the Academic Dean. A student auditing will appear on the course roster. The Office of the Registrar will not accept grades for course audits and no transcript record will be issued. Tuition for an audit is calculated at a percentage of the current applicable per credit tuition fee. Individual grade reports or transcripts are not provided for audited courses. Courses may not be subsequently converted or transcribed for credit. A student auditing a course is not required to adhere to course prerequisites or other course requirements, nor is the student eligible for instructional services. NON-DEGREE STUDENTS APPLICABLE TO THE UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES PROGRAM ONLY Students may enroll as a non-degree student, on a space-available basis, with permission from the Academic Dean. Non-degree students are not admitted to a specific degree program. Non-degree students must first apply for admission to the undergraduate studies program and meet the general criteria for admission. If admitted, non-degree students are governed by all Academic Affairs policies (with the exception of the Length of Time Allowed to Complete a Program policy). Non-degree students must also comply with all sections of the Student Handbook. Non-degree students may register for no more than 15 credit hours of undergraduate coursework; registration for some courses may be restricted by the degree program offering that course. All credits attempted non-degree will be used to compute a non-degree GPA for the purpose of determining academic status (See Policy on Academic Status). Non-degree students are not guaranteed admission to any specific degree program. They may apply for admission to a degree program and request earned non-degree credits be accepted for completion of that degree program. CLINIC PROCEDURES Clinic curriculum student interns who provide chiropractic health care to patients must do so under the mentorship and direct supervision of a licensed faculty doctor. The clinical conduct of student interns 71 is governed by Clinic policies, which are subject to change periodically to conform to state laws governing the operation of Palmer Chiropractic Clinics and the chiropractic profession. It is the responsibility of each student to keep fully informed of Clinic policies and abide by those policies at all times. Students are required to maintain the highest degree of professional integrity and ethical conduct in their relationships with their patients, colleagues, faculty clinicians and Clinic personnel. Refer to the Clinic Operations Procedures Manual and the Code of Student Ethics published in the Student Handbook for additional information. CLINICAL COMPETENCY ASSESSMENTS The Palmer Clinical Competency Assessment procedures are designed to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the development of clinical skills. Formative and summative methods are used to assess various clinical competencies integral to the successful practice of chiropractic. Evaluations determining overall clinical competence include both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of clinic performance. A variety of methods, including written and stationed examinations, simulated patient encounters, direct observation and clinician feedback are used throughout the student's clinical training to guide and assess the development of clinical competency. Students must receive a satisfactory performance on competency exams as well as in the evaluation of their performance in the care and management of patients in the College's clinics to satisfy clinical competency requirements for graduation. COURSE CANCELLATION POLICY The College reserves the right to cancel a course for any reason. Registrants will be notified of cancellations in a timely manner and refunds will be processed within three weeks of the scheduled cancellation. PROGRAM CANCELLATION In the event that one of the College's campuses education program closes, every attempt will be made by the College to assist students seeking transfer to other chiropractic colleges. Students wishing to transfer to another Palmer campus will be awarded advanced placement based on a detailed course-by-course review. In addition to awarding advanced standing, credit by examination options and supplemental educational opportunities may be used to expedite advancement through the program. ATTENDANCE Attendance is a necessary element of a Palmer student's education. The College recognizes excused and/or exempted absences for a limited set of circumstances. Palmer College must comply with related state and federal laws and regulations regarding a student's attendance. Federal regulations require that students earn their financial aid funds by attending and actively participating in courses. To verify financial aid eligibility, attendance information is collected by the Office of the Registrar. If notification of non-attendance in any course is received, the determination of federal financial aid eligibility will be re-evaluated and may result in financial aid forfeiture and/or a balance due to the College. If a student is not attending classes, the student is expected to complete the official withdrawal process of the College. Students must report all excused or exempted absences to the Office of the Registrar. The Registrar's Office may require supporting documentation from the student. The Registrar's Office will notify the faculty of the student's absence. Palmer College recognizes excused absences for jury duty, short-term military duty, pregnancy-related conditions and childbirth and exempted absences for mandatory religious obligations, unavoidable events and College supported activities approved by the Dean of Academic Affairs. Students called for documented jury duty or short-term military duty will submit official notification of service to the Office of the Registrar in advance of the absences. The Office of the Registrar will notify faculty of the absence. Notifications of service will be maintained in the student's file. The returning student is responsible for contacting the course instructor, who will provide the appropriate make up assignments for the days missed. Absences outside the designated time frame will not be excused. This policy does not in any way release students from the responsibility of satisfying all requirements necessary for the successful completion of any course. 72 Absences for pregnancy-related conditions or childbirth are excused when the student's licensed health care provider deems the absence medically necessary. The student will provide supporting documentation to the Office of the Registrar, who will communicate the excused absence to the course instructors. Requests for adjustments or modifications are managed through the Student Disability Services Coordinator. Students experiencing absences due to mandatory religious obligations, unavoidable events and College supported activities approved by the Dean of Academic Affairs must contact the Office of the Registrar prior to the absence when the absence is foreseeable. The Office of the Registrar maintains a list of College supported activities approved by the Dean of Academic Affairs. Extended absences that do not allow the student to meet the course requirements may prompt the College to issue an administrative withdrawal. Students on extended excused absence will be given a reasonable amount of time to make-up the work he/she missed or be allowed to re-enter the program at the point where they left. MILITARY ACTIVE-DUTY NOTIFICATION In the event an enrolled student or an enrolled student's spouse with a dependent child receives active duty notification, the student must provide the Registrar with advance notice of military service. Notice may be either written or oral. It may be provided by the student or by an appropriate officer of the branch of the military in which the student will be serving. However, no notice is required if: Military necessity prevents the giving of notice; or The giving of notice is otherwise impossible or unreasonable. Dependent on the point in the academic term, one of the following options will be afforded to the student: 1. The Registrar will process a withdrawal from the College for the academic term enrolled. A grade of \"AW\" (Administrative Withdrawal) will be placed on the student's record. The student's tuition fees will be refunded in full to the student or the student's lender, whichever is appropriate, regardless of the point in the academic term that the military orders are received. The Registrar will notify the appropriate departments of the withdrawal. 2. Arrangements will be made with the student's instructors for course grades, or for incompletes that shall be completed by the student at a later date. If such arrangements are made, the student's registration shall remain intact and tuition and mandatory fees shall be assessed for the courses in full. 3. Make arrangements with only some of the student's instructors for grades, or for incompletes that shall be completed by the student at a later date. If such arrangements are made, the registration for those courses shall remain intact and tuition and mandatory fees shall be assessed for those courses. Any course for which arrangements cannot be made for the grades or incompletes shall be considered dropped and the tuition and mandatory fees for the course refunded. Upon completion of Active-Duty service, the student may contact the Registrar for re-enrollment. Students returning after a hiatus of greater than one year will be required to meet the re-admission guidelines as outlined in the re-admissions policy. The academic term of enrollment from which a student withdrew will not be considered in academic progress relating to financial aid eligibility or academic status. In addition, the Length of Time to Completion policy will be lengthened based on the length of time the student was away from the College due to military service. WITHDRAWAL FROM THE COLLEGE A student may find it necessary to withdraw from the College on a temporary or permanent basis before the posted campus \"Last Day to Drop a Course\" date. Withdrawals from the College occur: Officially when the student contacts the Office of the Registrar or completes and submits a \"Request to Withdraw\" form, available in the Student Administrative Services Office. Unofficially when the student stops attending classes but does not formalize the withdrawal through the Office of the Registrar. 73 Students who withdraw may experience a reduction in their financial aid and may be required to refund or repay a portion of their financial aid. The process for determining if and how much aid may need to be repaid can be found under the Federal Return of Title IV Funds Policy within the Tuition and Fees section of the handbook. Upon notification of withdrawal, a withdrawal grade will be posted for all currently enrolled courses. The student's course instructors and necessary College departments will be notified. The Student Administrative Services Office will determine the amount of any tuition refund. Refunds due will be forwarded to the student's loan lender or the student, whichever is appropriate, within 30 days from the date of withdrawal. Petitions to withdraw in extenuating circumstances after the official last day to withdraw should be submitted to the Registrar. Such a withdrawal is discretionary, issued under extraordinary circumstances, which, in the judgment of the academic dean, subjects the student to an unreasonable burden of completing course work in a timely fashion. An approved, qualified professional must document a student's incapacity. The student must officially withdraw from all classes through the Registrar and must have a \"Fit to Return\" form signed by an approved, qualified professional before re-admission is granted. It should be noted that College policy requires students to graduate within a specific number of years, depending on program of enrollment, from the first day of attendance. Students taking one or more academic terms off should be aware that this may affect their financial aid and that a repayment of loans could be initiated for students taking off two or more consecutive terms. Contact the Financial Planning Office for details. A grade of \"W\" or \"AW\" is counted toward hours attempted but does not produce quality points and does not affect a student's GPA. The Palmer College Satisfactory Academic Progress Standards for financial aid eligibility require that students are making progress towards completion of their degree. Withdrawal from courses may have a direct impact on loan eligibility during the next period of enrollment. Please refer to the Financial Aid Eligibility Requirements Policy, and refer any questions regarding Title IV aid eligibility to the Financial Planning Office. RE-ADMISSION This policy pertains to administrative decision for re-admittance of students who are currently withdrawn from enrollment. Re-admission may occur in the following instances: Students returning from a hiatus or suspension of less than one year; Students returning from a hiatus or suspension greater than one academic year but less than five years; Students returning from a hiatus greater than five years; Dismissed students seeking re-admission. Students returning after a hiatus of less than one year shall contact the Office of the Registrar a minimum of thirty days prior to the start of the academic term. Students returning from a hiatus longer than one year, but less than five years from active registration, are required to submit an Application for Re-Admission to the Registrar at least 60 days prior to the start of the academic term to re-enter the program. If the student has completed coursework at other institutions during the hiatus, transcripts must be forwarded directly from those institutions to the Office of the Registrar.

The new materials submitted, and the student's past academic and ethics record will be reviewed by the Academic Dean. The College reserves the right to require that students demonstrate competency before resuming their chiropractic studies, as well as require the student to meet the current Council on Chiropractic Education (CCE) admissions requirements. The Dean will determine the student's placement within the program and terms of re-admission. Students who have taken a hiatus of less than five years from their initial enrollment date may request to have their previous academic record voided and start 74 over as an incoming first term student. All requests will be evaluated by the Registrar and presented to the campus Academic Dean, or designee, for final action. Decisions affecting this action should be guided by the Length of Time to Complete Academic Course of Study policy. Students who interrupt their Doctor of Chiropractic education for five years or more will retain no course credits according to accreditation standards established by the Council on Chiropractic Education (CCE). RE-ADMISSION FOLLOWING DISMISSAL Students previously dismissed from the College may apply for re-enrollment consideration to the Academic Dean.

Students further agree to abide by all College regulations contained in the Catalog, Student Handbook, other publications and notices placed on official College bulletin boards including its portal, digital monitors, the Palmer app and/or website. This includes students who reside in College premises; participate in preceptorships; and participate in any College programs on or off College premises. Students also are expected to abide by local, state and federal laws. The College assumes its students will conduct themselves as responsible citizens. The College, therefore, reserves the right to dismiss any student at any time, should it be in the best interest of the College or the student to do so. It is the personal responsibility of every student to respect the rights of others and to conduct themselves with integrity. PURPOSE The intent of this Code is to ensure that students neither lose their rights nor escape the responsibilities of citizenship. Students enrolled at the College must be guided by the highest standards of ethical conduct. They are expected to demonstrate professional qualities when dealing with persons in the academic community, with chiropractic patients and with the public. RESERVATION OF RIGHTS REGARDING THIS CODE The College reserves the right, without notice, to modify its policies, rules, processes, procedures and/ or guidelines; to change the content of this Code or to alter any other regulation affecting the student body; to place a student on interim suspension with or without filing a charge of misconduct; to remove a student on an emergency basis from its educational programs and activities whether the disciplinary processes are underway or not; or to impose discipline up to and including dismissal of any student at any time should it be in the interest of the College, or of the student, to do so. JURISDICTION OF THE STUDENT CODE OF ETHICS The Code shall apply to conduct that occurs on College premises or at College sponsored or College-related activities or service functions on or off College premises or at non-College activities on or off College premises that adversely affects the College Community and/or the pursuit of its objectives and/or triggers the College's responsibilities under College policies or law. This includes online activities. Each student shall be responsible for his/her conduct from the time of application for admission through the actual awarding of a degree, even though conduct may occur before classes begin or after classes end, as well as during the academic year and during periods between terms of actual enrollment (and even if their conduct is not discovered until after a grade or degree is awarded). The Code shall apply to a student's conduct even if the student withdraws from school while a disciplinary matter is pending. The Code shall also apply to conduct occurring online such as harassment delivered by email or acts of bullying or discrimination posted in video form or on gossip sites. Students must also be aware that information posted to blogs, webpages, social networking sites such as Twitter, Snapchat and Facebook, or other online postings are in the public sphere, and are not private. These postings can subject a student to a charge of misconduct if information posted online relates to, supports or constitutes misconduct. The College does not regularly monitor online activities but may take action if and when such information is discovered. 133 NON-COMPLIANCE WHEN PROCEEDINGS MAY OCCUR For a complete list of potential sanctions for noncompliance with the Student Code of Ethics, refer to the Student Code of Ethics published in the Student Handbook ADDITIONAL CONSEQUENCES FOR NON-COMPLIANCE The policies and rules that govern this College process and the policies and rules of other College processes generally operate independently and do not substitute for each other. Subsequently, a finding of misconduct may result in additional consequences outside the jurisdiction of this College process or render a student ineligible for things a student may otherwise be eligible for such as but not limited to the following: Financial aid Immigration status Scholarships Awards Leadership positions Membership or participation in certain clubs and organizations Preceptorship Please contact the appropriate College official for questions regarding other College processes. INTERNAL ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS This Code does not mirror criminal or civil legal processes. This Handbook is administrative, not legal. Therefore, rules of law, evidence and criminal/ civil procedure do not apply and will not be utilized with minor exceptions as specified in this Handbook. While the activities covered by the laws of the larger community and those covered by College rules may overlap, it is important to note that the community's laws and the College's rules operate independently and that they do not substitute for each other. Proceedings may be instituted against a student charged with misconduct that potentially violates both the criminal law and this Code (that is, if both possible violations result from the same factual situation) without regard to the pendency of civil or criminal litigation. The College may pursue enforcement of its own rules whether or not legal proceedings are underway or in prospect and may use information from third party sources (such as law enforcement agencies and the courts) to determine whether College rules have been broken. Proceedings under this Code may be carried out prior to, simultaneously with, or following a civil or criminal proceedings at the discretion of the Coordinator. COOPERATION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT The Coordinator will cooperate with law enforcement in order that this Code does not interfere with the integrity or timing of a criminal investigation. At the request of law enforcement, the College may temporarily defer the fact-gathering portion of its investigation. LEGAL DETERMINATIONS Neither law enforcement's determination of whether or not to arrest or prosecute a student nor the outcome of any criminal prosecution are determinative of whether or not ethical misconduct has been proven under the Code. The College cannot and does not determine whether a crime has been committed beyond a reasonable doubt. That can only be done through the legal process. Determinations made or sanctions/discipline imposed under this Code shall not be subject to change solely because criminal charges arising out of the same facts giving rise to a charge of ethical misconduct were dismissed, reduced or resolved in favor of or against a student. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHARGES OF VIOLATION OF LAW When a student is charged by federal, state, or local authorities with a violation of law, the College will not request or agree to special consideration for that individual because of his or her status as a student. If the alleged offense is also being processed under College processes, the College may advise legal authorities of the existence of such processes and of how such matters are typically handled within the College community. 134 INQUIRIES For a complete copy of the Student Code of Ethics, please refer to the College's website at https://www. palmer.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/student-code-of-ethics.pdf .

All undergraduate courses are taught on Palmer College of Chiropractic's Davenport, Iowa, campus. PAYMENT OF ACCOUNTS The College reserves the right to modify or change requirements, rules, tuition and fees. Such modifications or changes shall be effective without notice whenever it is determined appropriate by the College. The College has established all tuition, fees and bookkeeping procedures on an academic-term basis. Tuition, fees and other charges are due and payable on the tenth day of classes. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE Financial assistance is provided through the College Financial Planning Office. The basic premise of federally funded financial aid programs is that since the student will be the primary beneficiary of the education, he or she is expected to contribute to the cost of the education from assets, earnings and other financial resources. Financial aid is intended to be a supplement to the student's contribution. Financial Planning provides access to available grant and loan programs and student debt counseling. Financial Planning is located on the third floor of the Campus Center on the Main Campus and can be reached at 563-884-5740 or 800-722-2586, ext. 4. UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE The Undergraduate Program Oversight Committee (POC) is a standing committee that meets on a regular basis to review applications, recommend candidates for the degrees, approve course offerings and act in an advisory capacity. ACADEMIC POLICIES Undergraduate studies policies are described within the Academic Policies section of this catalog or online in the Palmer College Policies Handbook at: www.palmer.edu/HandbookPolicies. BACHELOR OF SCIENCE DEGREE PROGRAM OVERVIEW A Bachelor of Science (B.S.) completion degree in General Science from Palmer College is offered only at the Main Campus through dual credits earned in the D.C. curriculum to students with 90 hours of qualified undergraduate credits while enrolled in the Doctor of Chiropractic degree program. The Bachelor of Science completion degree is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC). BACHELOR OF SCIENCE PROGRAM PURPOSE STATEMENT The College's Bachelor of Science Degree program is dedicated to building a firm foundation on which to meet the challenges of a career in the field of chiropractic. This curriculum is designed to complement and enhance the doctor of chiropractic program, while providing students with an education committed to preparing lifelong learners. HISTORY The Bachelor of Science Degree program began as the Division of Liberal Arts in 1962, designed to accommodate the rising requirements for two years of prerequisite courses completed for licensure by various states. In 1965, Palmer Junior College was formed to provide for the expansion of educational opportunities on the College's main campus. The first candidates to receive B.S. degrees from Palmer College of Chiropractic were at the June,1966 graduation exercises. From the fall of 1975 to 1983, a cooperative program was held between St. Ambrose University and Palmer College of Chiropractic. The B.S. degree was accredited with the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools in 1983. Starting with the matriculating class in October,1983, Palmer College of Chiropractic again instituted its own B.S. degree program, which continues today. 152 B.S. PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS Palmer College offers a Bachelor of Science Completion degree in General Science to those students who qualify and apply. The B.S. degree requires that students complete a minimum of 90 credit hours leading toward a bachelor's degree outside of the doctor of chiropractic curriculum. The remaining 30 hours are achieved through dual credit earned in the first year of the Doctor of Chiropractic Program (DCP). Of the 90 prerequisite hours, a minimum of 30 undergraduate credits must be completed at an institution accredited by an agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education prior to applying for enrollment into the B.S. completion degree. Undergraduate courses are offered on the College's Main Campus to meet credit requirements for the bachelor's degree. This degree is conferred simultaneously with, but independently from, the doctoral degree in chiropractic. The bachelor's degree can be awarded concurrently with the Doctor of Chiropractic Degree Program or up to one year prior to or after completion of the D.C. program. The minimum program requirements are 120 total credit hours: 30 credit hours are achieved through dual credit earned in the first year of the DCP. 30 credit hours must be 300/400 (junior/senior) level courses. 60 credit hours maximum may be 100/200 (freshman/sophomore) level courses. Other program information: No grade below a \"C\" (2.00 on a 4.00 scale) will be accepted toward the B.S. degree. Up to 15 credit hours may be granted from course work in vocational/technical programs (transferable as freshman/sophomore level courses). Up to 20 credit hours of CLEP (College Level Examination Program) may be granted (transferable as freshman/sophomore level courses). The minimum distribution requirements of subjects by credit hours are as follows: Life and Physical Sciences: 24 credit hours (includes biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, geology, astronomy and nutrition) Humanities: 6 credit hours (includes literature, history, philosophy, art, theater, music, religion and physical education) Social Sciences: 9 credit hours (includes psychology, sociology, political science, business, economics, geography, anthropology and computer science) Communication and Languages: 9 credit hours (includes classical languages, foreign languages, English, communication and speech communication) Mathematics: 3 credits hours (includes Algebra, Physics, Statistics, Math for statistics, Applied Math and Calculus) Undergraduate courses which do not fall into the categories listed above will be classified at the discretion of the Undergraduate Program Oversight Committee.
