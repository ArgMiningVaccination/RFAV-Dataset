Service users in hospital are much more prone to infections and diseases as they are already unwell therefore extra precautions are always taken. This includes service providers ensuring that their vaccinations are up to date, working in a In today's society, one of the primary objectives is to ensure that staffs working in the various department of the health sector have maximum protection, inclusive of the environment in which they live dwell and play. Therefore, adequate measures must be implemented to extenuated environmental and occupational hazards. The occupational and environmental health takes a multidisciplinary approach as it relates to the correct identification of diseases from exposure hazardous agents in the community of in the workplace. Through the learning from week 1 and week 2, I have learnt that the most frequent adverse event in health-care delivery is health care-associated infections. It is essential for us to follow the infection control practices that both patients and us are at a risk of being infected. Standard Precautions involve the use of safe work practices and protective barriers, for example, the use of personal protective equipment(PPE). At first, I think Standard Precautions are very easy. Everyone knows PPE can protect us from infections and hand hygiene is important throughout the process. However, what I ignored and did wrong were the correct sequences of wearing PPE and how to use them correctly. The sequences are totally different when taking on and Clostridium difficile infection and transmission prevention continues to represent difficult and serious challenge in patient safety and infection prevention. A single inpatient Clostridium difficile infection costs more than $35,000 in average and the estimated yearly cost burden for the health care system is more than $3 billion (MedPage Today, 2012). The epidemiology of Clostridium difficile infection is continue to change, and its presence in the community and the healthcare settings has caused healthcare personnel continue to re-evaluate approaches and perspectives. So, what is the definition of health care associated infections? They are infections that patients acquire while being hospitalized to receive treatment for their conditions either medical or surgical. Many of the HCAIs are preventable. In the modern healthcare, there are many types of invasive procedures that is used to treat patients to help them recover, also some devices are used, and all can be a potential risk for transmitting an infection to the patient while receiving the treatment. Disposal and handling of hazardous materials such as nappies and body fluids is an important part in the Staphylococcus epidermidis is an opportunistic pathogen, meaning that they can cause infection more frequently and more easily in persons' with a weakened immune system such as, HIV patients (CDC, 2015). This organism is seen primarily in nosocomial infections, also known as, hospital-acquired infections (Bukhari, 2004). This means that the organisms favors the hospital environment and is easily passed to a person while they are in the hospital. Ways that a person can get a Staphylococcus epidermidis infection is through IV's, more commonly in drug users, catheters, and artificial equipment (Bukhari, 2004). Skin-to-skin contact can also be a form of getting this type of infection. The people that are most susceptible to get Staphylococcus epidermidis are newborns, the elderly, immunocompromised patients, and patient's who are using a catheter. This is because newborns and the elderly do not have as strong of immune systems as children and middle-age adults 3.2 Outline the procedures to be followed if an accident or sudden illness should occur. Being the nurses the forefront in the goal of deliver quality of care, and patient-centered care, it is imperative to provide insights and action-planing interventions that can direct the nurses to achieve the highest levels of nursing performance. The nursing sensitive indicators are screening tools that help nurses to structure the level of care, establishing the process of how this care is performed, the appropriate interventions, and expected outcomes of the nursing care provided. The competent and professional use of these screening tools provide a save environment for patient care, and the appropriate interventions needed in each particular case knowing that every patient is unique and require patient-centered care. These nursing Thousands of patients need medical help and care at inpatient and outpatient facilities each year in USA, unfortunately often they face life-danger problem- Hospital-Acquired Infections (HAI). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, daily 1 in 25 patients has at least one infection developed from the hospitalization. So what is it hospital-acquired infection? What are the reasons of development? And the most important question- how can it be prevented? A hospital-acquired infection (HAI), also known as nosocomial infection, is a new infection that develops in a patient during hospitalization. Usually it is evident as an infection in forty-eight to seventy-two hours after admission, but is excluded at the admission, also Clinical governance ensures that organisations become accountable for continuously improving their services and safe-guarding standard of care 'by creating an environment in which excellence in clinical care will flourish' (Scally and Donaldson 1998). Clinical audit emerged from within the clinical governance framework and is now seen as one of the most important elements of clinical governance (NICE 2002); it has been defined as 'a quality improvement process that seeks to improve patient care and outcomes through systematic review against explicit criteria and the implementation of change'. The student intends to focus this audit on staff knowledge in relation to Hand Hygiene and Infection Control and to evaluate the hand hygiene education Blood and body fluids may contain blood-borne viruses or other bacterial and other viral pathogens. These can present a risk to other patients and health care workers. As it is not always possible to know who is infected with these pathogens, emphasis on infection control effort should focus primarily on 'Universal Infection Control Precautions' (UICP) which prevent the exposure to blood and body fluids Which are presumed to be potentially infective.(KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA APRIL 1995) Transmission of infection within a health care setting requires three elements: a source of infecting microorganisms, a susceptible host, and a means of transmission for the microorganism to the host. Needlestick injuries are injuries due to exposed and improper use of needles or sharps. The ANA in 2010, commemorated the 10th anniversary of the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act, which improved protection against these injuries that expose health care workers to potentially deadly blood borne pathogens. These injuries, unfortunately, are still occurring today and far too often. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in March 2000, estimated that approximately 62-88 percent of sharps and needlestick injuries are preventable. Health care workers that handle sharp devices or equipment like scalpels, sutures, needles, phlebotomy devices or blood collection devices are all at risk but nurses are at a very high risk for being exposed to these preventable injuries which exposes them to numerous bloodborne pathogens especially deadly viruses such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV/AIDs. Needle-stick injuries may occur when disposing needles, collecting and disposing of materials used during patient care procedures, administering injections, drawing blood, or handling trash or dirty linens where needles have been inappropriately discarded. The CDC estimates that over 1,000 hospital-based health practitioner (HP) sustain injuries from contaminated needles and other sharp devices during the delivery of patient care everyday. Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) is one of the most important agents in the prevention of hospital acquired infections or what we termed nosocomial infections. IPC channels every member of the hospital, which includes, healthcare providers (HCP), patients and the hospitals perse. It is important to practice IPC commandment to every hospital as well as community. The Palestinian Ministry of Health (MOH) adopted the national IPC protocol. Employees working in pediatrics hospital are supposed to take precautions to protect their patients and staff from exposure to potentially infectious materials. A fundamental component of standard infection prevention measures are a system of barrier precautions to be used by all personnel "}
