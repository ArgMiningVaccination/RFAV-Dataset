Give your body a boost Our bodies have a pretty impressive ability to clear out the junk, but environmental toxins, excess alcohol, caffeine and processed foods can still take a toll. When the body's cleansing processes are overwhelmed, it often results in fatigue, brain fog, a depressed immune system or even some serious diseases. Trimming the fat If you are trying to lose weight, cleansing is even more important. Many of the toxins we are exposed to daily through the food we eat and the air we breathe are stored away in our fat. This is our body's way of protecting itself from the many elements that can cause anything from fatigue to cancer. When you start losing weight, you are essentially breaking up the fat and releasing the toxins right back into your blood stream. A good cleanse can even help you lose weight more efficiently. Even if you aren't trying to lose weight, ridding your body of toxins can help you feel more energized and healthier overall. There are several cleansing products on the market that often include various supplements designed to clean your colon, kidney or liver. However you do not have to spend a ton of cash or drink endless amounts of lemon water to give your body the boost it needs. Several foods available right at your grocery store will help you get the cleanse you seek. Eat organic If you want your efforts to be the most successful, it is important to buy organic produce and products. Produce covered in pesticides is like taking one step forward and two steps back. Watercress This clover-like veggie looks a bit like tiny spinach leaves. You could toss them in a salad and they'd likely go unnoticed, but they make a big impact in the body. These little greens have been found to reduce DNA damage to the cells which is what often leads to cancer. It is also known to increase antioxidant levels in the body which is another great way to fight off cancer and other illnesses. A [study](http://carcin.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/11/1983.full) done by Norwich Research Centre found that smokers who were given 170 milligrams per day eliminated higher than average amounts of carcinogens in their urine. Smoker or not, it may be worth it to add this to your diet. Beets These bright root veggies make a terrible mess when you cut them open, staining everything in their path. However it is that bright red pulp that provides some great benefits to the body. Beets contain high levels of betalains which have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and detoxification properties. In addition, betalain pigments from beets have been shown to reduce tumor cell growth in a variety of organs. Their benefits can decline quickly with cooking so try shredding them and eating them raw on salad or keep cooking times to a minimum. Dandelion tea Most people think of the dandelion as a pesky weed or perhaps if you are a child, a wish maker. In most places in the world though, the dandelion is far from a problem but rather a super food. Dandelion tea is thought to be a great way to cleanse the liver and kidneys and helps reduce water retention. This unassuming tea may also lower cholesterol, help diabetics stabilize their blood sugar and can boost immunity to name a few. Some people even bathe in it or use it as a facial cleanser to remove impurities from the skin. Next time you make a wish on a weed, you'll think of all the amazing things those little seeds will do someday. Apples Foods rich in pectin, like apples, are known to help remove radioactive residues from the body. The skin of the apple is especially high in pectin. Pectin attracts other molecules and binds to them making it possible for your body to eliminate them through the urine or feces. Other pectin-rich foods include pears, guava and citrus fruit. Apples are known for their high levels of pesticides, so in this case, it is definitely best to find organic apples. Garlic It may give you bad breath, but your liver will appreciate it, so load up. Garlic is known to boost liver enzymes which help in cleansing the body of toxins. It is high in allicin and selenium as well which are also beneficial for liver cleansing. In addition, garlic can function as a natural antibiotic ridding the body of bacteria. It turns out the junk in your body doesn't appreciate its pungent odor either. Chlorophyll Plant chlorophyll does more than just make plants green, it is a excellent resource for your body. Chlorophyll actually sucks toxins out of the blood stream, neutralizes heavy metals and helps increase the production of bile which is what helps to cleanse toxins from the body. Leafy green vegetables or dark green vegetables like spinach, broccoli and seaweed all have high levels of chlorophyll and offer other benefits of their own. Chlorella, most often consumed in tablet form, can actually neutralize radiation and mercury related conditions as well as many other metals and toxins. Lemon There's a reason that some extreme cleanses involve drinking tons of lemon water. We all know they are high in vitamin C, which helps boost the immune system and fend off colds in the winter. However, you may not know that vitamin C also helps to synthesize toxic materials so that they can be absorbed by water and thus eliminated through the urine. Other citrus fruits like grapefruit and lime are also great cleansing foods. Consider drinking some lemon water first thing in the morning or having a grapefruit for breakfast. Water Whenever you are doing a cleanse of any kind, it is crucial to drink ample amounts of pure water. Not all bottled water is created equal; much of it is no better than what the filter on your sink can provide. Head to the health food store or a water store and ask for recommendations. Water that has been alkalinized may even boost your cleansing efforts.
