Common household and body-care products are increasingly being found to have negative health effects on the nervous and immune systems, on our reproductive systems and on our endocrine, cardiovascular and respiratory systems. [The average home contains 500-1,000 chemicals](http://healthychild.org/blog/comments/three_shocking_facts_about_the_air_in_your_home/), many of which we are unable to see, smell or taste. While these chemicals may be tolerated individually and in small doses, problems can arise when one is exposed to them in combination or in larger doses. Everyone's tolerance level is different depending on genetics, nutritional status and previous contacts with many chemicals, but the negative effects of household toxins are often compounded by the use of other drugs especially the habitual use of alcohol, or prescription or recreational drugs. [Indoor air is typically 2-5 times more polluted than outdoor air](http://healthychild.org/blog/comments/three_shocking_facts_about_the_air_in_your_home/). Home insulation, so wonderful for keeping our homes warm in winter and cool in summer, doesn't allow fresh air in, so we're constantly breathing in the same stale air. Wall to wall carpeting keeps us cozy, but can introduce a myriad of toxins to our well insulated homes. It can also trap dirt, fleas, dust, dust-mites and lead. Many of the cleaning products we use to clean our furniture, bathrooms, windows etc. are full of toxic chemicals, some of which do not even appear on the labels. Similarly with the many personal-care care products we put on our skin and the pet-care products we use on our pets. Most tick and flea products contain active ingredients and solvents that might cause cancer in animals. Also, substantial human exposure is possible by absorption through the skin, while playing with and handling the pet. The pesticides we use on our gardens eliminate not only plant pests but also most of the insects that are beneficial to help control these pests. [Of the 30 most commonly used lawn chemicals, 19 have studies pointing toward cancer and 15 are known to cause nervous system poisoning.](http://www.beyondpesticides.org/lawn/factsheets/facts&figures.htm) This is not to say that we should not keep our houses comfortable and clean and our yards looking good. What's important is to understand that how we do this can have an important impact on our health. Abundant toxins can and do lead to health problems. Taking more care to reduce our exposure to both internal and external toxins, by [detoxing our bodies](http://www.elevenelevenwellness.com/getting-started/getting-started-remove) and our living space allows the body's own detoxification to function more efficiently. This strengthens our resilience to the daily onslaught of factors impacting our health. There are many things you can do to \"detox\" your home, some more practical than others. Here are my 20 suggestions: - No shoes in the house (as most household dirt, pesticides and lead come in on your shoes). Go barefoot or wear slippers.

[Replace your skin care and personal products with less toxic and chemical free options](http://www.drfranklipman.com/what-chemicals-should-you-look-out-for-in-your-personal-care-products/). Deodorant, toothpaste, cosmetics, hair products, nail polish and perfumes are often loaded with toxins. [Learn how to identify them and avoid them.](http://www.cosmeticsdatabase.com/) [Avoid non stick pans, pots, bakeware and utensils](http://www.drfranklipman.com/which-is-the-safest-cookware/)(as Teflon contains perfluorinated chemicals (PFC's) which have been linked to cancer and developmental problems). [Get a water filter](http://www.ewg.org/tap-water/getawaterfilter)(as more than 700 chemicals have been identified in drinking water). Filtering your tap water is better than drinking bottled water. [Check Radon levels in poorly ventilated basements that have cracked walls and or floors](http://www.epa.gov/radon/pubs/citguide.html). Radon is an odorless gas that forms as uranium in rocks and soil breaks down. Radon is linked to lung cancer We can reduce our risk of chronic illness by limiting our exposure to these toxins but don't let this become an obsession which can cause so much stress that it creates more of a negative impact on your health than the toxins themselves. And finally, no amount of environmental toxins are as important as emotional toxicity. You can do all the above, but if your house is full of anger, resentment, jealousy, unhappiness and a lack of love, compassion and forgiveness, the house will remain toxic. -------- Frank Lipman MD is an internationally recognized expert in the fields of Integrative and Functional Medicine.
