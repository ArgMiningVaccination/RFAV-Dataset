Sequoia Parks Conservancy is working closely with the National Park Service to restore access to the public in 2024. Crystal Cave is among the many noteworthy features of Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. Visiting Crystal Cave Crystal Cave is an excellent example of a marble cavern. A half-mile loop trail leads through the cave, and there's also a steep half-mile walk to and from the cave parking area to the entrance. Because of fragile formations, the only way to visit the cave is on a guided tour. Tours are suitable for all ages. If you decide to see the cave, plan on spending about half a day traveling to the cave, walking to the entrance, and taking the 50-minute tour. Assistive Listening Devices (ALDs) and American Sign Language Tours Available Assisted Listening Devices allow visitors with hearing loss to have the tour naturalist's voice amplified through headphones, or directly into hearing aids with the assistance of a t-coil loop. ALDs are available to every tour group. Directions Vehicles over 22 feet and those towing trailers are not allowed on the narrow and curving Crystal Cave Road.
