Behind each and every success are the talented, devoted people of U of U Health\u2014constantly improving life through groundbreaking research, impeccable patient care, transformative learning, and service to the community. groundbreaking r esearch By its very nature, research is a collaborative process. And that is why research continues to be a critical part of our mission as an academic medical center and the driving force behind all we do. The university kicked off 2019 by celebrating our impressive legacy of research and discovery. Last year, the university achieved its most successful research funding year ever\u2014with $515 million. o ur own U of U Health researchers were responsible for nearly 70 percent of that total\u2014awarded $356 million in extramural grant funding. As you'll see in this edition of Illuminations , our campus and research community stand ready and able to serve the people of Utah, the region, the nation, and the world in new and profound ways. For example, you'll read about Jason Shepherd, Ph d, a young researcher who received $2.5 million from the Chan-Zuckerberg i nitiative to explore new molecular mechanisms that may play a role in Alzheimer's disease. Impeccable p atient c are U of U Health continues to embrace an authentic commitment to our patients and dedication to ongoing improvements. As a result, in 2018, Vizient, i nc. ranked us among the nation's top 10 academic medical centers for quality and safety for the ninth consecutive year. And for the fifth consecutive year, U.S. News & World r eport ranked University of Utah Hospital the No. 1 hospital in Utah. We credit these achievements to our dedicated faculty and health care professionals who work long and hard to create exceptional patient experiences every day. While they continue to keep their focus on the patient, as a health system, we are keeping an eye on the health and vitality of our workforce. Keeping up with demands of modern health care is challenging work. i n this issue of Illuminations , two of our doctors talk about how we're actively addressing physician burnout and wellness. Transformative Learning Just as our health system seeks to put the patient first in every way, our education system needs to put the student first. inspired by the successful outcomes U of U Health has achieved through its dedication to the Exceptional Patient Experience, President ruth Watkins has challenged the entire campus to pursue Exceptional Educational Experiences. Through culture change and curriculum reform, the School of Medicine has shifted from the one-size-fits-all approach to teaching and learning methods that empower students and faculty to create a valuable and transformative educational experience. As leaders and educators, we want to do a better job of seeing things from the student perspective. We want to provide a learning environment where students feel safe to try new things and fail. The inspiring student and resident stories in this issue of Illuminations , help us see things through their eyes and remind us of our primary purpose as an education system\u2014the students. community Service & p artnerships i believe that a public university exists to improve the lives of the community it serves. Last year, University of Utah Health contributed $171.5 million in uncompensated care to the state of Utah. We also received more than $150 million in philanthropic support from generous community members and alumni like you. We recognize it is the people within our organization, our partners in the community, and our alumni who make University of Utah Health all that it is. in these dynamic times, to serve our state, we can't achieve all we must do, alone. As we look to the future, it is critical that our collaborative campus culture expands to include our community partners to address all aspects of health. With your ongoing support and participation, i can't wait to see what comes next as we continue unlocking our collective potential as a university and integrated health system! Thank you for your continued engagement with the University of Utah, our community and our world. Here's to a great future, Michael Good, Md CEo, University of Utah Health dean, University of Utah School of Medicine SVP, University of Utah Health Sciences2President's Message Although i live and practice medicine in Salt Lake City, i had been uninvolved with the University of Utah School of Medicine since graduating from medical school. Like many of you, i was busy with my medical practice and family and my only connection with the School of Medicine had been reading Illuminations a few times a year. However, my reading of Illuminations did continue my interest in what was happening at the School of Medicine. When i was asked to become a member of the University of Utah School of Medicine Alumni Association board, i readily accepted, as i wanted to be involved with the School of Medicine after many years away. After a few years of serving on the board, i am now pleased to serve as the president. i have reconnected with the University of Utah School of Medicine and learned of the substantial changes to facilities and to the curriculum since my graduation. Most notably, i have met many School of Medicine alumni, faculty, staff and current students. This is the experience i had hoped for when i joined the Board. My medical school years hold many fond memories for me, which also made me interested in serving on the alumni board. My medical school class recently held a class reunion. i reconnected with people i had not seen in many years, but the friendships we made in medical school were so strong, i felt like we barely missed those years apart and were as friendly and bonded as ever. The Alumni Association represents all alumni who have graduated from the School of Medicine. o ur board consists of members who are graduates of the medical school and residency house staff, and graduates of the University of Utah physician assistant program and other masters and Phd programs. o ur mission is to represent all School of Medicine alumni in making their connection to the U and to assist and engage current medical school students and residents throughout their educational years. Whether you are a recent or distant alum, the Alumni Association offers many ways for you to make a connection. We have an Alumni Programs Committee, which oversees the Alumni and Medical Community Weekend and the Half Century Society. o ur Student Programs Committee connects current students and residents with alumni for social events such as the All Class Picnic, the Winter Social and d inner with a d oc. They also oversee the Fourth Year Alumni Award, Help o ur Students Travel program (H.o.S.T.), the Stethoscope Gift outreach, and offer students financial support though the Student Emergency Fund. The Education Committee plans the CME Symposium during Alumni Weekend, the UteMed speakers' series, the Student Poster Walk Competition, and hosts Transitioning into Practice for residents and 4th year medical students. The Communications Committee organizes content for this magazine and advises on our website and other mail and electronic communication. This issue of Illuminations has articles that will be of interest to everyone who is an alumnus/ae or friend of the University of Utah School of Medicine. Medical practitioner burnout and techniques to promote wellness is a subject that is getting a lot of well-deserved attention. This issue is explored in a thorough and timely discussion. There is a remarkable story of a medical student who has overcome a unique adversity and recovery to enroll at the University of Utah School of Medicine. You will find a summary of a chapter covering 2010-2015 from the How the West Won Medicine book, and there are contributions from multi-talented medical students excerpted from Rubor , the creative magazine of the School of Medicine. This is an exciting time to be involved at the University of Utah School of Medicine and with the Alumni Association. The Alumni Association continues to improve our programming to make connection easier and more comprehensive. The University of Utah is developing plans to replace the old medical school building (Building 521) with a new ME d Complex, an exciting endeavor which will transform the health sciences campus. i hope you enjoy the magazine and that the Alumni Association can assist you in making your own connection with the University of Utah School of Medicine. Warmest wishes, Teresa o ta, M d '88 President School of Medicine Alumni Association 3rediscovering Meaning in Medi cine University of Utah Health physicians share their strategies for reducing or reversing burnout it's no secret: Professional burnout among physicians in the United States is reaching epidemic proportions. A 2016 study published by the Mayo Clinic showed that physician burnout rates are high, and still climbing. of the nearly 7,000 physicians surveyed, 54.4 percent reported at least one symptom of burnout in 2014 compared with 45.5 percent in 2011\u2014a nearly 10 percent increase in only three years.4Burnout may be contributing to another startling statistic. research presented at the American Psychiatric Association's 2018 annual meeting suggests U.S. doctors have the highest suicide rate of any profession\u2014including the military. Physician burnout is rising because the health care industry is changing. And for the most part, these changes are here to stay. So, how can doctors avoid burnout and reignite their passion for providing care? According to i . raymond Thomason, M d, transplant hepatologist and program director for transplant outreach at University of Utah Health, if you want to change things in medicine you have to start with yourself. Although he and pediatric emergency medicine physician, d avid Sandweiss, Md, were both on the brink of burnout, each found his own way of adapting to change. Today, having come full circle, both physicians feel a renewed sense of purpose in their work. Struggling to Keep Updr. Thomason thinks of himself as an old-school doctor. The 68-year-old physician recalls when time spent with patients was determined by their needs, not by a software-generated template. When d r. Thomason returned to U of U Health six years ago after practicing at another health care institution, the system had just rolled out its electronic health record (EH r). While EH rs offer benefits including shared clinical data, decision support tools, and e-prescribing functionality, they dramatically increase administrative burdens for physicians and staff. \"i would go home each night and share a late, reheated dinner with my wife, and then stay up until 2:00 a.m. finishing my notes in Epic,\" he says. \" it felt like this new computer-driven system was taking away my flexibility and autonomy, adding an unsustainable amount of work, and creating a pace and pressure i found intolerable.\" Fortunately, d r. Thomason discovered a set of tools and processes called \"value engineering.\" Based on Six Sigma and Lean principals used by Toyota and other auto manufacturers, value engineering helps create efficiency. dr. Thomason says these learned skills leveled the playing field of excessive and wasteful work generated by the EH r, and transformed his ability to practice medicine in today's demanding environment. burning the c andle at b oth e nds For most of his career, d r. Sandweiss considered his long hours and demanding schedule a normal part of the job. He is medical director of the rapid treatment unit at Primary Children's Hospital and an associate professor of pediatrics at University of Utah School of Medicine. Along with his clinical, administrative, and teaching duties, he's also a devoted husband and father who volunteers at a free clinic in Salt Lake City. But in 2015, d r. Sandweiss gradually sensed that something was wrong. Although he couldn't quite put his finger on it\u2014\"burnout\" was still an unfamiliar term to him\u2014he felt like his work lacked meaning and purpose. \"i'd finish a shift at the hospital and feel like my clinical work and patient interactions were not bringing me joy,\" he says. \"i was more concerned about efficiency, volume, and output, and i wasn't sure how long i could continue in that role.\" Before d r. Sandweiss was forced to make tough career decisions, he stumbled across a simple solution: Mindfulness. Not only has this centuries-old, contemplative practice transformed his approach to work and life, it's led him down a fulfilling new path. He's teamed up with Marc Potter, a licensed clinical social worker who specializes in mindfulness- based practices, to help colleagues facing burnout. Understanding b urnout The word burnout is often used to describe the physical and mental consequences of chronic, work-related stress. i t entered the broader lexicon in 1981 following publication of the Maslach Burnout i nventory, a psychological instrument that measures three core dimensions of professional burnout: emotional exhaustion \u2014feeling emotionally overextended and exhausted by your work. depersonalization\u2014an unfeeling and impersonal response toward recipients of your service, care treatment, or instruction. personal accomplishment \u2014reduced feelings of competence or successful achievement in your work. Certain professions, including physicians, are prone to burnout because of the high-stress, high-stakes nature of their work. Signs of burnout You may be at risk of burnout if you regularly experience: Anxiety or a sense of dread about going to work. Feelings of indifference or hopelessness. Feelings of isolation or detachment. Forgetfulness or trouble focusing. Headaches, abdominal pain, rapid heart rate, or heartburn. Increased absenteeism or reduced job performance. Increased irritability or anger. Increased susceptibility to illness. Insomnia. Low energy or fatigue.5 A 2018 American Medical Association survey that polled 15,000 physicians across 29 specialties found that more than 40 percent of respondents were burned out. And certain specialties including critical care, emergency medicine, neurology, obstetrics and gynecology, family medicine, and internal medicine, are approaching burnout rates of 50 percent. What's c ausing b urnout? Seismic shifts in health care delivery, payments, and technology are impacting physicians in unprecedented ways, adding excessive work that creates new types of stress. \"our work load has become unmanageable because health care has become industrialized,\" says d r. Thomason. \"Scheduling is out of our control, everything has to be documented, we're overwhelmed with clerical tasks, and we're responding to email 24 hours a day.\" research suggests several key changes in the health care field are driving physician burnout: Declining reimbursements have led health systems to implement strict productivity expectations and cut costs, meaning physicians often need to see more patients in the same amount of time with fewer resources. EHRs require significant and time-consuming data entry. Mandatory quality reporting takes considerable time and effort due to the massive amounts of data that must be collected, measured, and tracked. National shortages of health care workers make it hard to maintain sufficient staffing. Another cultural factor well-known to physicians may not be changing quickly enough. Many doctors say they still feel obligated to perform at superhuman levels, remaining unaffected by long hours, disruptive on-call schedules, or the grief that often comes with caring for our most vulnerable. Combined with these intense pressures is a reluctance to ask for help. Physicians may be hesitant to seek counseling within their place of work or they may fear career repercussions, like being passed up for a leadership position.The f allout of b urnout As a counselor in the employee assistance program at i ntermountain Healthcare in Murray, Utah, Marc Potter frequently helps clinicians who are struggling with work-related stress and anxiety. \"Most physicians go into medicine because it's a calling, because they want to serve,\" he says. \"But when industry mandates and organizational pressures get in the way of healing and disrupt that connection with patients, it's easy to become cynical. And cynicism and negativity are infectious. They spread throughout the work environment.\" dr. Sandweiss agrees, citing his own symptoms of burnout and his experience working alongside harried colleagues.\"over time you start to feel 'put upon,' like you can't keep your head above water, and despite how exhausted you are, it feels like you didn't actually accomplish anything of value during your day,\" he says. \"You may even lose empathy for your patients\u2014the same people you previously wanted to help.\" A toxic attitude is just one of many potential consequences of burnout. Physicians who reach burnout are also more likely to: Leave the field of medicine. Be involved in a patient safety incident. Have clinical depression. Have broken marriages or other relationships. Develop alcohol or substance use disorders.\"Our work load has become unmanageable because health care has become industrialized, scheduling is out of our control, everything has to be documented, we're overwhelmed with clerical tasks, and we're responding to email 24 hours a day.\"6 Develop insomnia, high blood pressure, or other medical problems. Die by suicide. embracing e fficiency and c hange Through v alue e ngineering A chance encounter led d r. Thomason to connect with U of U Health's d epartment of Value Engineering. There, staff offers the equivalent of a semester-long course with weekly classes. The subject? Becoming more efficient, and delivering value to patients, by eliminating waste. The value engineering team taught d r. Thomason how to work more effectively, using various process improvement principles. He learned how to: Standardize work. Following protocols and eliminating variability saves time and money, improves quality, and reduces the risk of errors. perform single-process flow . Because multitasking involves lots of stops and starts, it's important to stay focused when you start something. Finish your task before you move on to the next one. d r. Thomason says that for him, this became the single most important tool. find more efficient ways to perform tasks . By eliminating unnecessary steps or delegating certain activities that utilize colleagues' talents, you'll free up time for personal activities and relationships. As part of his value engineering course, d r. Thomason was required to complete a mentored assignment. He decided to become the project. i n other words, he had university staff members shadow him throughout the day, observing opportunities to get rid of waste, redundancy, and inefficiency. The results, says d r. Thomason, were a game-changer. \"i learned that 85 percent of my activities were wasteful, adding no value to my patients,\" he says. \" i learned how to eliminate those four or five hours a night i was spending on Epic, along with practical ways to manage my email inbox. And the benefits have carried over to my personal life. i 've become much more efficient and effective in everything i do.\" dr. Thomason is now a member of the U of U Health value leadership change group. This team of clinical and nonclinical professionals is trying to understand how to implement methods, processes, and standardized work protocols that enhance the health care experience for patients as well as providers and their teams. \"i believe preventing burnout requires a two-pronged approach,\" he says. \"First, you must identify what's causing your burnout and develop skills to address or adapt to these factors. Secondly, you need to find ways to stay healthy and balanced. o therwise you're just running as hard and fast as you can to keep up, and you lose the joy of practicing this beautiful profession.\" To learn more about improving value and eliminating waste, visit www.accelerate.com. This tool is free and available to anyone. building Mindfulness p ractice into Medical p ractice dr. Sandweiss knew he couldn't change certain workplace burdens that contributed to his feelings of exhaustion and disenchantment. But in 2016, after attending one of Potter's presentations on physician burnout, he learned he could change his mindset. The practice of mindfulness has roots in Buddhist meditation dating back to the 6th century BCE. But in 1979, Jon Kabat-Zinn, Phd, introduced America to a secular, mainstream version of mindfulness when he founded the renowned Mindfulness-Based Stress r eduction (MBS r) program and Stress r eduction Clinic at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Mindfulness is a kind of exercise for the mind. i t trains your brain to focus your attention on the present moment without judgement, and without becoming overly reactive or overwhelmed by what's going on around you. i t allows you to face the stresses of life, work, and interpersonal conflict more calmly. While there are different ways to practice mindfulness, most techniques are a form of meditation that help you refocus your mind when it begins to worry or wander. Some people use their \"Like any form of exercise, you need time, motivation, and consistency to become skillful at these techniques.\"7breath as an anchor, while others repeat a word or phrase (mantra) or focus on the physical sensations around them. \"Like any form of exercise, you need time, motivation, and consistency to become skillful at these techniques,\" says Potter. \"But you get better over time, especially when you stick to a specific 'dose' on a specific schedule. Even 10 minutes of formal practice can impact your entire day. Your focus improves; you're less reactive, and you're able to be more compassionate toward yourself and others.\" decades of research by d r. Kabat-Zinn and others have shown that regular mindfulness practice has numerous physical, psychological, and social benefits. Mindfulness can: Boost your immune system. Improve memory, attention, and decision-making. Improve sleep. Improve symptoms of depression. Increase positive emotions while decreasing negative emotions. Lower blood pressure. Reduce chronic pain. Relieve stress. in 2019, Potter and d r. Sandweiss plan to launch an eight- week CME course for physicians and advanced practice clinicians called Mindful Practice: Healing Burnout, Enhancing Quality of Care, Caring, and r esilience. This program follows the research-driven Mindful Practice\u00ae curricula developed by University of r ochester Medical School. i t aims to help health care professionals: Foster skills of attentive observation and critical curiosity. Improve recognition of error-prone situations and reduce medical errors. Foster caring attitudes toward patients. Promote self-awareness, resilience, and health. \"A consistent practice of mindfulness has allowed me to better understand my habitual modes of responding to stimuli,\" says dr. Sandweiss. \"This has allowed me to slow down and become a better listener. i 'm more grateful for the gifts this life has given me. And i 'm more patient with myself and others. i t's not that i'm happy all of the time and don't struggle, it's just that i 'm much more able to approach life with equanimity.\" For more information about upcoming Mindful Practice courses at U of U Health, email d r.

While the University of Utah and Brigham Young University had always been feeder schools for School of Medicine students, the 2010 class included Utah State University students from rural communities including Price and Blanding as well as older Utah students who had earned their undergraduate degrees primarily online. By 2010, access to information, people, places and commerce could be found in the palms of our hands thanks to mobile technology, but keeping pace with the change had become one of the bigger challenges. At the University of Utah, Vivian S. Lee, M.D., Ph.D., M.B.A., brought innovative leadership to campus when she was named Senior Vice President for Health Sciences, Dean of the School of Medicine, and CEO of University of Utah Health Care. Together with students and faculty, the university wasn't just keeping up with the pace of all this change\u2014it was creating and inventing the future.In 2010... In-state tuition was $13,754/semester. The iPhone 4 was introduced. Congress passed the Healthcare Reform Bill and Affordable Care Act. TELEMEDICINE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF UTAH With telemedi- cine, diagnosis and treatment can be provided digitally, in consultation with local providers across the Mountain West. SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING AND IMAGING INSTITUTE V olume rendering at SCI provides a non-invasive look into the inner structures of the body, offering context to original CT scansExcerpted from How the West Won Medicine: from small medical school to global academic force9TURNING COMMUNITIES INTO CLASSROOMS Starting in 2009, and gaining traction by 2010, the School of Medicine curriculum made a tectonic shift toward the future\u2014and the educational innovation shook every corner of Building 521. It was reflected in the delivery of education itself, with traditional classroom settings being supplemented with online learning. It was also in the decision to make team training a clinical rotation, so students could work together in real settings with real patients. And it could be seen in the school's vision for extending education far beyond the walls of Building 521, pro-viding new opportunities for students to learn in the community\u2014and around the globe. Vice Dean for Education Wayne Samuelson, M.D., class of '80, and Associate Dean of Inclusion and Outreach Evelyn Gopez, M.D., set their sights on curriculum transformation by creating programs to educate students across disciplines while building healthier communities across the Salt Lake Valley. The cornerstone of this vision, created in partnership with deans from the College of Nursing and the College of Health, was interprofessional education in an actual pro-bono clinic where students could quickly learn how their fields of expertise complemented each other while also serving low-income patients who might otherwise go untreated. Opening in 2013 as a partnership between the School of Medicine, the Utah Department of Health and the city of Midvale, Utah, the student- run Midvale CBC Community Clinic set out to provide free access to health care and unique opportunities for students from different disciplines to learn from one another. Also in 2013, University of Utah became one of four medical schools to participate in a new AAMC pilot program to test the feasibility of competency-based medical education. Instead of following the traditional four year medical school model, students in the Education in Pediatrics Across the Continuum (EPAC) pro- gram, advanced through medical school as they mastered skill sets. Students would then enter the university's categorical pediatrics residency when they demonstrated competence. While the School of Medicine explored ways for motivated students to fast-track medical school, pediatrics department Chairman Edward Clark, M.D., led the development of a clinical research certificate program in undergraduate education, enabling students to gain intensive experiences and a minor in pediatric clinical re-search, so well-trained graduates could quickly move into jobs. To further support the change and growth, Dr. Lee worked with the state of Utah and the governor in 2013, securing commitment for state funding to expand the medical school class from 82 to 122 students. MIDVALE CBC COMMUNITY CLINIC At the student-run Midvale CBC Community Clinic, students from different disci-plines work hand-in-hand to provide needed medical services to under - served communities. \"About once every 100 years, you have the opportunity to rethink how medicine will be practiced. We are at one of those juncture points and we're doing it in pediatrics by disrupting the 1900s version of medical education. Six months into medical school, students get a year of deep experience, then another six months to explore. We're matching students two years ahead of graduation. This results in a broader, deeper, more intense pediatric education. This can happen here because the U is a wonderful entrepreneurial environment. There's this willingness to take risks and an environment of collaboration.\"PEOPLE of the UPEOPLE of the U Edward Clark, M.D. Wilma T.

The goal is to find affordable and sustainable ways to alleviate health disparities and weave wellness into the fabric of life in GhanaCULTIVATING A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE Beyond the state of Utah and the nation, opportunities for medical educa- tion and service continued to present themselves around the globe. In 2010, the University of Utah launched the Global Health Initiative, which provided an umbrella organization for the U's globally oriented health and medical efforts. This led to even more extensive cross-disciplinary col- laborations\u2014giving students new opportunities to work side by side with local and international global health experts. Further embracing the theme of global heath, the University of Utah opened its first international campus in South Korea in 2014. The Asia Campus offered a Master in Public Health degree with internships across Asia and worldwide. Later that year, Ensign College of Public Health opened its doors in Kpong, Ghana. This was the culmination of a vision long held by Elder Robert C. Gay and Sister Lynette Gay to transform public health scholarship and practice in West Africa.

Sorenson Molecular Biotechnology Build- ing, or USTAR (Utah Science Technology and Research), opened its doors. As part of a statewide initiative to promote and foster innovation in Utah, the building solidified the University of Utah's commitment to cross-disci- plinary scientific and technol- ogy research. Created by the Utah Legislature in 2006, USTAR set out to bolster Utah's research strengths and significantly increase tech- nology commercialization to create more high-caliber jobs throughout the state. At the University of Utah, the USTAR initiative \"helped attract fac-ulty who create inventions, file patents and get licenses issued four to eight times more often than the average faculty mem- ber,\" said Vice President for Research Thomas Parks, Ph.D. CROSS-DISCIPLINARY RESEARCH The USTAR building is a nexus of research among scientific disciplines at the University of Utah.THE NUCLEUS OF INNOVATION A place of promise and passion, where creative innovation practically flows out of the air vents, the Center for Medical Innovation (CMI) opened in 2012. CMI brings together students, medical professionals, engineers and business to tap into a wellspring of innovation and per- haps develop the next big thing. TURNING STUDENTS INTO ENTREPRENEURS Nurturing the inventor inside curious young minds, John Langell, M.D., Ph.D., M.P.H., M.B.A., F.A.C.S., direc- tor of CMI, worked with professor Robert Hitchcock, Ph.D., and Lassonde Institute Execu- tive Director Troy D'Ambrosio to help a group of intrepid students create the Bench-to-Bedside competi- tion, which held its first event in 2011. The competition encouraged medical, engineering and business students to work together on medical device innovation projects. With just a $500 prototyping budget and six months of development time, the student teams let their imaginations run wild and built on their ideas together. Receiving guidance from student mentors, multidisciplinary faculty and industry leaders, the students learned to shape their ideas into commercially viable products. In 2013, interdisciplinary education, clinical care and research at the University of Utah got yet another boost with the launch of the Neuroscience Initiative, thanks to innovative neuroscience research projects conducted by the U's Brain Institute. The initiative was developed to deepen understanding of the brain in disease and in health, and to translate that knowledge into solutions for patient care. Today, the Neuroscience Initiative, supported by the strength of neural engineering research, continues this work with a diverse community of professionals\u2014from neurologists to imaging specialists to molecular biologists\u2014span- ning six colleges and schools, 15 centers and institutes and 18 academic departments. Yet another bold collaborative shift came with the opening of the Department of Population Health Sci- ences in 2015. Designed to complement, strengthen and extend the capacity for population health scholarship across the University of Utah campus, the department opened with a mission to monitor health threats in all kinds of environmental conditions. Designed as a hub for education and investigation, the department was organized with a team-based approach to advancing knowledge on health care services, cost, quality, outcomes and delivery systems. A UNIVERSITY SPIN OFF CATCHES FIRE BioFire Diagnostics is one of the most successful spinoff companies ever created from technologies developed at the university. Co-founded in 1990 by Randy Rasmussen, Ph.D., class of '98, Kirk Ririe, B.S., class of '90, and Ririe's mentor, University of Utah professor of pathology Carl Wittwer, M.D., Ph.D., the company grew steadily in its first decade. In 2011, Ririe's FilmArray System and Respiratory Panel inven-tion enabled rapid testing for dozens of different organisms simultaneously and catapulted the company to new levels of growth and commercial success. In 2014, the company announced plans to double its workforce and introduced a rapid test for Ebola for hospital use. BioFire has ambitions to eventually develop tests for other commonly fatal diseases. \"This is the most crazy, audacious thing, and yet this is the pioneering spirit of Utah,\" Ririe told KUER, a radio station in Salt Lake City. \"This is why we're here.\" NEXT-GEN GENETICS With the power of the Utah Population Database, more than 35 years of genetic discoveries and some of the world's leading software for genomic analysis, the Utah Genome Project (UGP) launched in 2012. The inspiration for this project began with Heather and Logan Madsen. The siblings were born with both the rare disease Miller syndrome, which involves birth defects, as well as primary ciliary dyskinesia, a rare disorder afflicting the lungs. After Heather and Logan's mother married University of Utah geneticist Lynn Jorde, Ph.D., they began to unlock the mys - tery. In a historic first, the Madsen children and their parents were the first family in the world to have their whole genomes sequenced. The process revealed the genetic cause of the disorders and how they were inherited. The family finally had their answers, and this project demonstrated the value of family sequence analysis in pinpointing causes of Mendelian disorders. While this discovery found the rarest of the rare, the UGP and its team of investigators are using genome sequencing to help identify the causes of common conditions such as cancers and heart disease. THE NEUROSCIENCE INITIATIVE This cross-disciplinary pro - gram deepens scientific understanding of the brain and translates the knowledge into innovative treatments. UT AH 'S IN DE PE ND EN TVO IC think it's very possible that within the next decade, many people, maybe even most, will have their genomes sequenced,\" Jorde said. Equipped with this information, physicians could predict diseases in patients years before symptoms occur.12 \"If you create a medical device today, you have to work in transdisciplinary teams to ensure it has a protectable space, can clear the regulatory hurdles and will have a valid market demand. That's why we teach medical innovation in partnership with our bioengineers, who help ensure that our innovation teams create technologies under the current regulatory guidelines. We also bring in our law school and business school experts to cover intellectual property and business plan development. And we collaborate with industry to make sure inventions are viable in the marketplace.

On the heels of the article, Dr. Lee met with School of Medicine department chairs in the spring of 2012 and challenged them to find a way to lower costs. The conver-sation turned out to be a pivotal moment that brought to light a huge missing piece of the costing mystery: There was no way for the chairs\u2014or anyone\u2014to tackle costs because the data didn't exist. Six months later, a revolutionary costing tool was un- veiled called Value Driven Outcomes, or VDO. The devel-opment team's mission was to harness the masses of data and figure out how to allocate costs at the patient-visit level\u2014from the cost of gauze tape to individual chemo-therapy treatments to minutes of nursing labor. The next version of VDO enabled users to see direct correlations between the cost of every choice made and how it affects the quality of care. BENCH TO BEDSIDE In just five years, the Bench-to-Bedside program has trained over 500 students, created 115 new medical technologies, filed 86 patents, and formed 27 companies. DISSECTING DATA The medical informatics legacy that began with Homer Warner in 1964 has continued to thrive under the direction of Wendy W. Chapman, Ph. D., who was named chair of biomedical informatics in 2013. As big data is becoming both an information goldmine and a growing challenge, Dr. Chapman and her community of collaborators have set out to find creative solutions for data extraction and management to transform the health care system into a continuously learning organization. One of the pillars for the current-day bioinformatics work was laid 20 years prior by Jim Livingston, M.B.A., who understood the importance of developing a centralized data warehouse with integrated clinical and financial data. Long before it was the industry standard, Livingston stockpiled data he was already collecting while working as a software developer building the U's electronic health record. The result put University of Utah Health Care years ahead of other medical institutions in terms of accessible data, served as the foundation for the VDO tool and proved that the power of personal information could not only improve health, but also propel medicine forward. ACADEMIC ANIMATOR When Janet Iwasa, Ph.D., wanted to illustrate the complex molecular world of the AIDS virus, she went to the most obvious but least academic source: Hollywood. Learning techniques like storyboarding and rendering from the animation pros, Dr. Iwasa was able to condense volumes of data into a single, short movie that tells an engaging, highly visual molecular story\u2014and enables all of us to think differently about biology. 13INTEGRATING DISCIPLINES ACROSS CAMPUS Whether it's science, service or education, partnerships among the health, nursing, pharmacy and dental school are making the university's health system and medical training stronger than ever. Ranked No. 1 in quality and accountability among all university hospitals in 2010, the University of Utah has remained in the top 10 ever since. OPENING UP ONLINE In a world where consumers could find an online review for everything from plumbers to the kitchen sink, the process of shopping for a doctor was still cloaked in mystery. In 2012, University of Utah became the first health system in the na- tion to disclose patient reviews of physicians and publish them online. \"People are willing participants in providing thoughts about products and services,\" said Thomas Miller, M.D., chief medical officer at University of Utah Health Care. \"Health care is no different.\" Three years since launching online reviews, other institutions have followed in the footsteps of University of Utah Health Care, with Wake Forest, Cleveland Clinic, University of Pittsburg Medical Center, Duke and Stanford beginning to publish their physician ratings online. \"Personalized health or now, the more popular term 'precision medicine,' will be a journey that we\u2014patient, health care provider, scientist\u2014take together. Ultimately, our goal should be to focus on patient needs and desires, then tailor our intervention, whether it's a medication treatment or preventive intervention, to maximize benefits and minimize risk. In the near future, the greatest advances will likely occur in treating cancer, but we certainly hope and expect that discovery of disease-causing genes can lead to more effective interventions, from chronic diseases such as Alzheimer's and diabetes, to less common ones like cystic fibrosis.\" PEOPLE of the UPEOPLE of the U Willard Dere, M.D., F.A.C.P .

TIME TO g ET L EAN In 2012, with health care costs and inefficiencies compromising patient care, the University of Utah Health Care decided it was time to get serious about lean health care. The Lean methodology for eliminating waste started in Toyota manufacturing plants in the '90s and later made its way to the health care industry. The idea behind going lean at University of Utah Health Care was to empower all employees to identify inefficiencies in processes, especially those that frustrated them and didn't add value. The goal is to create an environment that enables the University of Utah to train the doctors of the future and equip them for a changing world of value-driven, patient-centered medicine. JIM LIVINGSTON, M.B.A., ASSOCIATE CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER, HOSPITALS & CLINICSin 2017 the University of Utah department of Family and Preventive Medicine and the division of Public Health began hosting the annual david N. Sundwall Lectureship in Public Health Policy to celebrate dr. Sundwall's contribution and legacy in the public health field. The second annual lecture was held at the University Alumni House on october 24, 2018. Alfredo Morabia, Md , Phd , professor of epidemiology at The Barry Commoner Center, Queens College and Editor-in-Chief of the American Journal of Public Health, spoke on the most significant public health issues covered by the journal in 2018. Following the cover stories of the journal from January 2018 thru october 2018, here is a highlight of some of the major health issues facing our country, our state, and the world: Hydration and adequate water access is a serious and growing issue, especially among racial and ethnic minorities and those of lower economic status. Between 25 and 40 percent of these individuals have inadequate hydration based upon their urine osmolality. The other issue is the changing access to water. Utah is impacted as the climate continues to warm and water supplies in the West decline. This could become a very serious issue in the not too distant future. The issue of despair, depression and suicide. There has been a significant increase in premature death by suicide, particularly among Caucasian populations, across urban, suburban and rural populations. Utah is #6 in suicide related deaths in the country, so is not immune to this disturbing trend. The increase in natural disasters, whether from fire, flooding, hurricanes, tornadoes, or other severe weather and the displacement of people that occurs due to these disasters. This is now becoming the norm in some areas of the country. dr. Morabia highlighted Hurricane Katrina and how many individuals relocated to Utah following that natural disaster and remained in Utah post displacement. The link between acute hepatitis C infection and the growing opioid epidemic and associated injected drug use david N. Sundwall Lectureship: significant issues facing public health today 1415 in the United States over the past ten years. There has been a significant correlated uptick in reported cases of HCV and the admission to substance abuse treatment centers based upon the injection of an opioid, any prescription opioid analgesics, heroin and all other drugs. Climate change is beginning to have an impact on public health issues and will be more detrimental in the future. The past decade is the warmest on record in the West. over the last century Utah has warmed by about 2 degrees Fahrenheit. Heat waves are becoming more common and mountain snowpack is melting earlier in the spring. Since the 1950's snowpack has been decreasing in Utah, Wyoming and Colorado, all of which feed the Colorado and Green rivers, both major sources for potable water and irrigation for western states. Although 100 years has passed since the great flu pandemic of 1918-1919, which infected one-third of the world's population, and killed upwards of 50-100 million individuals, there is a very real likelihood of a worldwide pandemic in the future. With increased global travel and an interconnected world, the likelihood of such an epidemic becomes magnified, making the importance of vaccines against viral infections even more significant.

But each year, at the School of Medicine Alumni Weekend, as i see graduates across all the ages reconnect with one another and reminisce about their time at the school, i once again confirm the importance of these reunions. But, of course, i'm a school reunion fan as i reconnected with my future husband at a college reunion years ago.... Friday morning dr. Good kicked off the weekend with a breakfast meeting, where he focused on highlights of the School and shared impressive facts and figures about our progress over the past ten years. Then a group of alumni participated in the Evolution in Teaching program featuring Associate deans discussing the admissions process, current student life, the changes in medical school curriculum, and inter-professional education training. Alumni also toured the simulation center, testing their own skills and seeing how students can practice various techniques and procedures with the use of simulators and patient actors. The class of 1968 held a dean's r oundtable with dr. Good and current medical students, sharing their career experience and advice from 50 years of being physicians. other alumni toured the library exhibits including Women in Medicine and the Animation of Biology and then ate an informal lunch as they strolled through the 21 posters and talked to the student researchers at the Student Poster Walk. That evening the School of Medicine Alumni Association once again put on the ritz, showing off the school and its graduates. The annual Awards Banquet highlighted the 2018 distinguished awardees while also recognizing 21 graduates of the Class of 1968 as they were inducted into the Half Century Society. The gavel of the Alumni Association Presidency was passed from Bryan Stone, Md '86 to Teresa ota, Md '88. Faculty, older alumni, former residents and fellows mingled with students, current residents and fellows, and younger alums. Michael Good, the new Sr. VP for Health Sciences, dean of the Medical School and CE o of UHealth MC'ed the evening with Bryan Stone, President of the School of Medicine Alumni Association Board. Closing remarks were shared by newly inaugurated University of Utah President, r uth Watkins. Saturday a four credit CME was jointly hosted by the School of Medicine Alumni Association and the internal Medicine department. Then the second annual CompHealth Community Faculty Awards highlighted three extraordinary clinical community faculty members while also thanking all current community teaching faculty for their service with a luncheon. The weekend wrapped up with eight reunion class dinners. if staying late was any indication, it seemed a good time was had by all. There's just something that can't beat meeting someone you spent four intense years with and sharing your lives face-to-face after many years.

Eric comments as he walks out the door that i am interviewing the best of the best fellowship trainees in pediatric surgery. Zach is completing his second year of a pediatric surgery fellowship. He is ten years past his graduation from medical school and sees the end zone in sight. Zach grew up in a small town of 1,200 residents in Wisconsin, where his dad was the family medicine doc for the town. He grew up being very familiar with the practice of medicine, sometimes shadowing his dad on house calls and ward rounds. While at the University of Minnesota for undergraduate studies he became involved with a research project studying the use of stem cells to help heal the heart after a myocardial infarction. This helped confirm his interest in medicine. He attended Harvard Medical School, and while there, attended a lecture by Steve Fishman, M d, a pediatric surgeon, showing videos and pictures of how embryological development could go wrong, which translated to problems d r. Fishman fixed as a pediatric surgeon. Zach was fascinated and asked to shadow d r. Fishman at Boston Children's Hospital. He began to focus his studies to pursue a career in pediatric surgery. After medical school he moved to Palo Alto to pursue his general surgery residency at Stanford University Medical Center, which included five years of clinical training and three years of research in health policy. While at Stanford his mentors helped direct him to what he should look for in a fellowship in pediatric surgery...a busy hospital with numerous highly complex cases, along with a collaborative, collegial atmosphere, where he could build relationships for his future career. The University of Utah d ivision of Pediatric Surgery and Primary Children's Hospital, quickly rose to the top of his choices. Zach describes his first year and a half of training as phenomenal, with reality far exceeding his expectations. There are roughly 40 pediatric surgery fellowships offered nationwide, and he feels he has had more opportunity than what is afforded in most programs, to work on some exceedingly complex and interesting cases. He's operated with Michael r ollins, M d, director of the Colorectal Center, on many rare conditions including two patients with Currarino syndrome where a triad of sacral agenesis (abnormally developed lower spine), anorectal malformation and a presacral mass, can cause a multitude of problems, often only repaired with surgery. i n addition he has completed multiple liver resections with r ebecca Myers, M d, chair of the national Children's o ncology Group Liver Committee, performed complex esophageal replacements with Eric Scaife, M d and doug Barnhart, M d, and observed the impressive evolution of the Utah Fetal Center under the direction of Steve Fenton, M d. He explained that Utah's high birth rate, Primary Children's' broad geographic catchment range, and U of U attending physicians who are willing to collaborate and have him work with them on their cases, is giving him some of the best training in pediatric surgery offered in the nation. He and his wife, Kelly Konopacki, a faculty member in the department of psychiatry, enjoy living in the Avenues where they have ready access to the Shoreline Trail. They also enjoy nordic skiing at Solitude, cooking together and entertaining friends. After his ten years of training, and especially the fellowship training he's received at the University of Utah, he feels very well prepared to begin the next stage of his life as a pediatric surgeon. -Kristin Wann AndersonreSIdeNT 'S LIfe rESidENT LiFE zAch K ASTeNberg- feLLOW , pedIATrIc SUrgery Zach Kastenberg and his wife, Kelly Konopacki22STUdeNT L Ife Growing up in Salt Lake City, Hank Shipman had one great love\u2014alpine skiing. He attended r owland Hall-St. Mark's school and skied with the r owmark ski team, competing in downhill and the Super G. He attended school in the morning and skied in the afternoon, traveling most weekends around the west to compete. He skied 100 plus days a year and planned to delay college for a few years to continue to ski competitively. Then in April 2011, just as he was turning 16, things changed in an instant. r eturning from a race with the r owmark ski team to Mt. Hood, o regon, the van he was a passenger in was in a head-on accident. Most of the students, even those with broken arms and legs, were able to get out of the van , but Hank, and the r owmark coach, Scott Veenis, were trapped. i t took 47 minutes before the Jaws of Life could cut them free. Hank was severely injured, with a spinal fracture to his neck at levels C3-6, spinal cord damage at C4, a broken scapula, a seriously lacerated skull, brain trauma, and a compound fracture of his femur. He was life-flighted to Portland where he had surgery and his neck was fused. After ten days he was stable enough to transport. A teammate's mother, Tiffany Glasgow, a pediatric in-patient physician at Primary Children's Hospital, flew to Portland to assist with his transport back to Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City. His spinal cord was damaged, with some significant paralysis. Fortunately, after about ten days, he began to get some movement back on the right side of his body, and then gradually more feeling back on his left side too. He first wiggled his left fingers 20 days after the accident. His injury caused bilateral neurological changes , with motor weakness on the left side of his body and sensory changes on the right, manifested by the absence of pain and temperature sensation. After completing three months of healing and inpatient rehab at Primary's, he returned to school and every afternoon went to Neuroworx, a nonprofit outpatient physical therapy clinic in Sandy. Neuroworx was co-founded in 2004 by d ale Hull, M d, '85, a former School of Medicine Board President, after his spinal cord injury in 1999 prevented him from continuing his o B/Gyn medical practice. Neuroworx focuses on intensive neurological rehabilitation for individuals experiencing paralysis from spinal cord injuries, brain injuries, stroke, and other neurological conditions. over seven months Hank progressed from a wheel chair to walker, to crutches, to one crutch and eventually to walking on his own. He continued his 4-5 days a week rehabilitation schedule for three years at Neuroworx, and feels some of the technology and therapies provided there were crucial for his recovery. He now can walk with a quite normal gait, though he still has weakness on his left side, and minimal feeling on his right side. He has returned to skiing and rock climbing, the things he loves, while continuing to work on his strength, balance and coordination. He credits the success of his recovery to good luck, Neuroworx, his youth, his great conditioning as a ski racer, his work ethic, from his many years of ski racing training, and the support of friends and family in the Salt Lake community. Still, it took him a good year to accept the fact that he'd not be able to return to competitive skiing, so he needed to find another focus and passion for his future. The AccIdeNTAL MedIcAL STUdeNTPrior to his accident, Hank had channeled all his energies into ski racing and competition and had never particularly liked the sciences and had not ever considered a career in medicine. A few things began to change his focus. First, d r. Glasgow, who had flown up to Portland to assist him right after the accident, became a mentor. She impressed him with her work with patients. Secondly, fueled by his own experience with other healthcare providers, both inspiring and frustrating, he believed his own experience could be a way of helping others. He turned his energies towards academics and a new goal of becoming a physician. Handicapped not only by his spinal cord injury, which took him out of school for a significant length of time, but also his brain trauma, which reduced his mathematical level early on to first grade math, he worked hard to recover from both his physical and mental injuries. Because he was frustrated by how little is still known about spinal cord injuries; why some people recover as well as he did, and others, with nearly identical injuries, don't, he began looking for a college degree that would help him better understand his own injuries, and those of others. He chose a program at the University of Michigan called Human Movement Science, with its three foci on, motor control, biomechanics and exercise physiology. Upon graduation he took a year off to teach English for six months at an elementary school in Salt Lake City and spend three months working on a biological conservation site in the Ecuadorian rainforest before he applied to medical school. He also volunteered at Primary Children's Medical Center Neuro Trauma Unit (NTU) a year after his injury and at Neuroworx as he applied to medical school. Although he had other opportunities for medical school, as soon as he was accepted at the University of Utah, he knew it was the place for him, both because of family and friend support, and because he felt he could build the best network of mentors, since many of the faculty had treated him after his injury. He currently thinks about specializing in physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM r) primarily because of his personal experiences as well as the influence of Tiffany Glasgow, dale Hull, physical therapist, Jan Black. and the nursing staff in the NTU. But he hasn't ruled out pediatrics, or a combination of pediatrics and PM r. regardless, his primary goal is to work in a specialty that focuses on working as a team, has longitudinal patient care, and where the patients are passionate about getting as much from what medicine has to offer as possible. He has started his second semester and is very impressed with the support afforded students both academically and personally with the numerous wellness programs available to help them deal with the inherent stress and long hours of medical training. He is excited about his future and thankful for all he has learned. He feels that if not for the accident, he wouldn't have chosen medicine, but now sees a clear path to a career which will be both challenging and rewarding. The AccIdeNTAL MedIcAL STUdeNT24STUdeNT L Ife As i did my first newborn exam today, it hit me. How you were supposed to be. A healthy baby, likely colicky, but nevertheless loved by your family. You should have been interactive with your primitive reflexes still intact, maybe even making a student chuckle with your Moro reflex just like this little one did for me today. Your clavicles and ribs should have been growing, not healing multiple fractures. Your skin should have only displayed the benign lesions we expect, not the numerous ecchymoses we only discovered well into your hospital stay because you came to us in a medical papoose instead of swaddled like your successor. You haunt me. You've been following me, largely without notice, around the halls of Primary Children's Hospital and even venture home with me. Yet you must always be in my periphery, for you slip into my thoughts frequently now, always leaving melancholy in your wake. i know how much skill this takes, because i , too, do my own slipping in. i slipped into the trauma bay for the first time that day and shadowed the hoard into the CT reading room to watch Neurosurgery quickly scroll through your scans whispering phrases like globally hypoxic, diastatic fractures, and finally non-operable before brusquely leaving. i slipped behind my fellow as he was leaving the E d and listened as his only reply to police questioning was \"his [your] injuries are not consistent with the mechanism from the history.\" Joining you in the elevator was too obvious, so i slipped through the back stairwells and hallways into your P iCU room behind the procession of intensivists, surgeons, and support staff. i was the silent sentinel to everything that happened to you that day. i watched them take blood and transfuse blood. i witnessed a fellow futilely try to place a central line for two hours before the attending took over, only to take another. i listened as your mother told the police that it was her first day back to work from maternity leave and she had called your father to ensure he was up to drive your brother to school but discovered he had overslept. Everything was running late. it wasn't your fault. i do not know what triggered your father's final episode of abuse, but i hope it was mercifully fast. You did not deserve this. You became my own private sadness when you slipped in, because the rest of the team quietly continued on, expressing anger with words, but not tone, for those that commit these atrocities against children. But i obsessed about you. i read your chart innumerable times, hitting refresh hoping to see new updates. i eavesdropped on conversations with specialists hoping for mention of you. i compulsively scrolled through your imaging and retinal scans for hours, mentally cataloguing every abnormality. Primary is supposed to serve as a presidio, protecting children like you from disease and death. o ur system failed you; someone here had to bear witness to your life. The closest to true enragement i saw on our service was your attending aggressively lecturing me a few days later on another suspected non-accidental trauma case, \" don't belittle it into something more palatable. i t's like calling rape 'non-consensual sex.' i t's absurd. Call it what it is. Child abuse.\" i wonder will all your future unfortunate comrades join you until i have a small phalanx as my shadow urging me to call it by its true name? Maybe you're not always in my periphery, little one; perhaps you're a part of a brigade that follows him, slipping occasionally into his thoughts as well. rUbOr S UbMISSIONS A SiLENT SENTiNEL by d annen Wright, MS iV by Ketevan Amirkhanashvili, MS iVTHE PSYCH WArd Hard to deal with the rollercoaster of emotions The pain, the cravings, the nightmares.

Trenton Honda, Ph d, PA-C, Associate Professor and the new Physician Assistant Studies d ivision Chief. \"This was my first opportunity to participate directly in the mission of UPAP, and the dedication and altruism i witnessed from faculty, staff, and students alike was humbling.\" richard Bennett, Phd, PA-C, Associate Professor in the Physician Assistant Studies Program and clinic event coordinator, identified the needs of the Hildale community and worked with local community leaders and PA partners at i ntermountain Healthcare and d ixie State University to organize a multi-specialty health fair with an eye on providing culturally sensitive dental, eye, and medical exams for the children of Hildale. To facilitate this, dr. Bennett arranged for participants to take a tour of the town, learn about its recent history, and, perhaps most importantly, develop the cultural competence necessary to provide compassionate care. Hildale, UT, formally known as Short Creek, is an area of southern Utah and Northern Arizona that was settled in 1935 by a group from the Council of Friends. This isolated location allowed the group to continue the outlawed practice of polygamy. i n 1953 the governor of Arizona sent troops into the settlement to stop polygamy. A two-year legal battle ensued that proved to be a political disaster and led to a hands-off attitude toward the community. The area continued in relative isolation for the next 50 years. Leadership change in the church resulted in a series of policies and practices that destroyed families and resulted in significant trauma to the local population. The trauma the community went through is considerable, including separation of parents, children, and siblings, forced malnutrition, lack of safety, and reduced opportunity for basic education. Women and children in the community witnessed violence with numerous and ongoing reports of sexual assault. r ecent changes in the political landscape allowed for outside intervention in the community at a significant level for the first time. Throughout the course of Saturday's outreach event, the Physician Assistant Studies program and its community partners provided: 101 fluoride treatments 120 pre-participation sports physicals 60 eye exams 59 adult screenings for hypertension, diabetes, substance use disorder, and mental health Donation of more than 100 children's books This special event would not have been possible without assistance from r ichard Backman, M d; richard Bennett, Phd, PA-C; Jennifer the St. George UPAP and our community partners.

Mary e lizabeth h artnett, M d28NeWS N OTebOOK University of Utah Health is one of three sites in the nation to conduct a seven-year, multiple-million dollar, multi- disciplinary contract with the National institute of Health. The U is partnering with the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National institutes of Child Health and Human d evelopment (N iCHd) internal group for a series of studies focusing on improving population health throughout the life course surrounding fertility, pregnancy and the fetal origins of adult disease. The N iCHd established the d ivision of i ntramural Population Health r esearch to improve population health from birth to death by maximizing health and preventing disease. r esearch has focused on various population subgroups, with an emphasis on early origins of health and disease. A significant proportion of the focus is on fertility, pregnancy and childhood development. There is an emphasis on at-risk populations including racial-ethnic minorities, individuals with obesity, disabilities or chronic diseases, and poverty. The project will involve a series of studies aimed at issues relevant to reproductive and childhood health. The first study, led by d r. C. Matthew Peterson, will assess if infertility is a general marker of health, and if there are subtle underlying health issues or environmental issues which increase a woman's inability to become pregnant or carry a child to term. Past studies have shown that women with inflammation have problems becoming pregnant. The study will assess whether treatments for inflammation can improve fertility. 1,800 women nationwide (600 at Utah) will be divided up into three study cohorts: women taking a low dose aspirin and a statin, both of which reduce inflammation, women taking aspirin alone, and a placebo group. The fertility rates and pregnancy outcomes will be measured. The second study, led by d r. Bob Silver, will start in about a year and will evaluate the effects of maternal and paternal mental health on pregnancy outcomes and childhood development. The Utah Center consists of the Utah Center for r eproductive Medicine as well as the five referral hospitals: (University of Utah Hospital, intermountain Medical Center, L dS Hospital - Salt Lake City, UT; McKay dee Hospital Center - o gden, UT; Utah Valley regional Medical Center, Provo, UT). The UC rM and the five hospitals coordinate care for the majority of fertility and high-risk perinatal referrals from the northern portion of the Mountain Time Zone. This significant referral base for fertility patients and high-risk deliveries has been of great value to numerous previous studies. This o bstetrics and Gynecology r esearch Network has extensive experience in fertility enhancement, preconception counseling, pregnancy, and post pregnancy outcome management and follow-up. This project is truly a multidisciplinary effort! Multiple departments throughout the UHealth system are collaborating including urology, pediatrics, hospital operations, perinatal epidemiology, psychiatry, population health sciences, family medicine and dentistry.

While at the University of Utah, d r. rodr\u00edguez has taken a strong role in advancing the institutional goals for health equity and inclusion. Within his department, he has served on the diversity committee, as well as various recruitment committees, supporting focused recruitment of underrepresented ethnic and racial minority faculty and residents. At the institutional level, he has served as a member of the Core Collaborative for the o ffice of Health Equity and i nclusion. He has represented the university, presenting at national conferences on our work and his research on diversity initiatives. Prior to his appointment at the University of Utah, d r. rodr\u00edguez served as the co-chair of the Council on d iversity and i nclusion and the co-director for the Center for Underrepresented Minorities in Academic Medicine at Florida State University College of Medicine. He is an accomplished academic, publishing numerous articles on the importance of UrM in academic medicine. dr. rodr\u00edguez is looking forward to capitalizing on the tremendous work that has already been done at UHealth, and is eager to build on those efforts to move toward a more diverse campus for health sciences students and faculty. The d epartment of Family & Preventive Medicine is pleased to welcome Trenton Honda, Ph d, PA-C as the Chief for the d ivision of Physician Assistant Studies and as an Associate Professor on the lecturer track. \"As our department's Physician Assistant Studies program continues to grow with the recent addition of students at the St. George campus and the expanded research footprint of our faculty, d r.

The Chan-Zuckerberg initia - tive was founded by Mark Zuckerberg, CE o of Facebook, and his wife Pricilla Chan to provide new solutions to human disease. A major goal of the initiative is to bring new people with innovative ideas that solve intractable problems, in this case neurodegeneration. \"This is a tremendous honor for Jason, who is highly deserv - ing,\" said Monica Vetter, Ph d chair of the d epartment of Neurobiology and Anatomy. \" one of the intriguing aspects of the CZ i award is the focus on establishing collaborative networks that bring new people to the field of neurodegen - eration research. Jason brings exciting new ideas together with an enthusiasm for working collaboratively on chal - lenging problems.\" The Shepherd lab will receive $2.5M over five years for the project titled Viral-like Mechanisms of intercellular Communi- cation in the Pathology of Neurodegeneration. Their work will explore new molecular mechanisms that may play a role in Alzheimer's disease. \"The Chan-Zuckerberg i nitiative is looking for ideas that are out of the box to understand the science behind neurodegen - eration,\" said Shepherd. \"For me what is most exciting is this award gives my lab the freedom to pursue high-risk ideas that depart from the typical approach to Alzheimer's disease.\" Alzheimer's disease is marked by a slow, unforgiving mara - thon of memory loss. Shepherd is looking for molecular mechanisms that cause neurons to malfunction that predates cell death and the progression of disease. \"By the time most patients are diagnosed with dementia it is too late,\" Shepherd said. \"We need to be able to diagnose early and hopefully do it in an easy way.\" His lab is focusing on a particular neuronal gene, Arc, a master regulator that keeps synapses malleable and memory logged. Previous work has shown this gene is turned on when you learn. i t has also been linked to Alzheimer's disease. Shepherd believes Arc may play a critical role in our neurons' garbage disposal system. This system is important because if toxic proteins accumulate in the cell, the neuron dies. Arc may draw from its fascinating origins as an ancient retrovirus to perform this function. i t uses its retroviral ability to create capsids, or cocoons, to trap toxic proteins to be removed from the cell. Shepherd's lab will explore the gene's roles in the removal or build-up of toxic proteins in neurons and the progression of Alzheimer's disease. \"The holy grail is to find a marker, like Arc bound with toxic proteins, in the blood that could be used as a diagnostic of the disease,\" Shepherd said. in addition, Shepherd wants to leverage the volumes of research on H iV, another retrovirus, to identify new ways to target the protein cocoon created by Arc to find new therapies for Alzheimer's disease. \"We are concentrating on Alzheimer's disease, because we al - ready know that Arc is involved in disease pathology,\" Shepherd said. \"However, i think our results could potentially apply to other neurodegenerative diseases (Parkinson's disease and ALS) that also result from the accumulation of toxic proteins or r NA.\" Shepherd says the intellectual freedom he has experienced at University of Utah Health, to follow the intriguing leads in science, no matter how risky, has contributed to the success of his early studies. The Ben Barres Early Career Acceleration Award awards are administered through the Neurodegeneration Challenge Network, which brings together experimental scientists from diverse research fields \u2014 neuroscience, cell biology, biochem - istry, immunology, and genomics \u2014 along with computational biologists and physicians, to understand the underlying causes of neurodegenerative disorders.NeWS N OTebOOK CHAN -ZUCKE rBErG iNiTiATiVE AWArd S JASoN SHEPHE rd, P Hd $2.5M T o STUdY ALZHE iMEr'S diSEASE 31People turn to direct-to-consumer genetic test kits for a vari - ety of reasons: to answer questions that family are unable to provide, to understand the genetic underpinning that makes you unique, or just sheer curiosity. But what do you do when the results arrive in the mail? it may only seem natural to trek to your doctor for an expla - nation. Surprisingly, one breast cancer study found that many physicians lack the genetic knowledge to interpret results. o f- ten, results lie between the guideposts of disease-causing and benign (variants of uncertain significance). When a readout is not clear cut, it is more challenging to formulate evidence- based health care decisions. Medical schools are aware of this short-coming and many insti - tutions are beginning to develop courses to enhance physician understanding of genomics. To accomplish this goal, University of Utah Health established the four-year Certificate in Personalized Health Care in 2012 to help the next generation of doctors devel - op the skills needed to practice medicine in the era of genomics. \"i think the certificate is to my medical degree like a minor is to an undergraduate student,\" said Chad Hilton Webb, a first year M d/ Phd student enrolled in the certificate program. \" it shows that i sought out and developed additional skills during my education.\"Personalized health aims to shift medicine from a one-size-fits- all approach designed for the average patient to more target - ed therapies designed to tackle the genetic variation unique to a specific patient. This innovative approach takes into account each individual's genes, environment, and lifestyle. \"Physicians are seeing patients with genetic disease but few have the specialized skills to interpret genomic information, much less communicate this information to their patients,\" said Emily Coonrod, Ph d, Associate d irector, Program in Person - alized Health at U of U Health. \"We have expanded on this certificate program to train the next generation of medical professionals to be better equipped to help patients navigate complex health care decisions.\" Participants in the program obtain skills in understanding and communicating with their patients about health literacy, genome sequencing, inherited disease, and pharmacogenomics to name a few. Throughout the program, students will have the unique op - portunity to work with a number of active interdisciplinary stake - holders in the Utah genomics community, including ArUP Labora - tories, a national reference laboratory and nonprofit enterprise of the University of Utah, the Utah Genome Project, bioinformaticists, genetic counselors, and bioethicists. i n addition, the program offers medical students hands-on genomics experience, includ - ing: communicating about direct-to-consumer genetic tests results and limitations; interpreting results of genomics-based medical tests; understanding the role of genetic counselors; understanding how drugs interact with a person's specific ge - netic make-up; familiarity with bioinformatics tools to interpret genomic data; evaluating patient risk for disease based on genomic information; and applying genomic technologies in an ethical, legal, and socially appropriate way. Coonrod believes the skills developed during the certificate program will set graduates from the U School of Medicine apart from their peers as they compete for residency programs. \"This certificate program provides our students a platform that exposes them to patient stories and professionals who practice genetic medicine,\" Coonrod said. \"We are educating the next generation of health care practitioners that will meet the needs of an ever-evolving health care system.\" The Genetic Science Learning Center, at www. learn.genetics. utah.edu is part of the Human Genetics department at U of U Health. i t develops content for the certificate program as well as many resources on precision medicine and genetics, which are available to the general public.

What she has noticed is that in moments like these, trainees and providers alike do not know how to respond to disrespectful treatment. in her own life, Cowan has begun a practice of setting boundaries by responding directly to inappropriate comments or actions. \"My message to whomever i am correcting is always the same,\" she states in the article. \" i care about you as a person, but i will not tolerate offensive behavior. Now let's focus on how i can help you today.\" Her experience has led to new training for medical students and trainees to gain practical skills in responding to these situations. \" i find that they easily recognize disrespectful behavior, but calling it out is still excruciating,\" Cowan notes in her article. She works within the medical curriculum to implement opportunities to role-play scenarios in informal settings. She may role-play an inappropriate behavior and ask the student to respond immediately. They then have the chance to practice setting boundaries in a professional setting, building confidence in their response. \"Boundary setting has to be practiced to become reflexive,\" she notes in the article. \"When we practice in a safe environment, we create muscle memory of the skills that will protect us when our white coat will not.\" Amy Cowan, M d, MS is an assistant professor in internal medicine at the University of Utah. Her main clinical practice is at the George E. Wahlen Veterans Affairs Medical Center, were she also supervises residents in training. She completed medical school at John A. Burns School of Medicine at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. She completed a fellowship in geriatrics at the University of Utah. \"Boundary setting has to be practiced to become reflexive, when we practice in a safe environment, we create muscle memory of the skills that will protect us when our white coat will not.\" To read the entire article in JAMA go to: 33dying patients without friends or family by their side are no longer spending their final hours alone at University Hospital thanks to a new volunteer program. Since July 2018, No o ne d ies Alone, has transformed the experience of dying for three or four patients each month. The volunteers provide the constant human connection busy hospital staff may not have the capacity to offer. \"What we focus on with volunteers is being with patients rather than doing things \u2014 being a healing presence,\" said Tyler Montgomery, a University Hospital Chaplain. NodA organizers point to the fact that as no one is born alone, ideally no one should die alone. But people who are isolated from family, may have outlived their relatives or have suffered an accident while far from home do not always have someone nearby to be with them. Homeless or transient individuals are also a part of that population. PeaceHealth, a health care system in Alaska, o regon, and Washington, started the program in 2001 after a critical care nurse saw the need to give people respect and dignity through companionship in their final hours. A medical resident who had attended school in o regon asked if the University of Utah could bring the program here. The program fit with an ongoing effort to give patients more dignity at death. The i magine Perfect Care i nitiative at U of U Health paid for the PeaceHealth curriculum, and training began in Utah. Medical students such as Brian Zenger are among those participating, which gives them a unique opportunity to learn more about the end-of-life process and spend substantial time with patients. Volunteering is different from what he expected. \"The more i sat there, i realized how important it was \u2014 not for me to be sad \u2014 but to be present for the patient,\" said the 25-year-old M d and Ph d bioengineering student. He tries to make the hospital room more welcoming by dimming the lights, closing the curtains and turning down the volume on the television. He'll move a chair next to the bed and turn on a C d of ocean waves. Zenger always introduces himself to the patient \u2014 even though most are not speaking at this point \u2014 and asks what they need. \"i think this is one of the most amazing, priceless experiences i'll have as a training clinician.\" Every volunteer has their own approach; they may adjust pillows and furniture, read aloud to patients, play soothing music or hold the patient's hand. Volunteers are provided with a NodA bag, which includes a C d player, C ds, books of poetry and religious books. Nothing is pushed on individual patients. Medical staff request a N odA vigil when a patient without friends or family present is in the final days of life. Volunteers, who commit to three-hour shifts, are contacted for their availability. About a dozen volunteers are currently available and more are going through training. Zenger emphasized that the N odA program is apolitical and not advocating any particular way of dying. \" our sole goal and mission is to be present with patients during their transition from life to death, so they do not have to be alone,\" he said. NodA offers support of its volunteers, hosting quarterly meetings where volunteers can share their stories and have more closure if they were not there for the patient's final moments. \"i really consider it a privilege to be with somebody in that time when they transition,\" said Zenger, who helps coordinate the volunteers.

Faculty investigate and treat difficult diseases - namely; viral, fungal, immunologic, and travel and tropic related diseases - across the State of Utah and throughout the i ntermountain West. Currently, there are few resources available in the division to support the recruitment and retention of faculty. recognizing this need, Woody and Joanne Spruance established a new endowed professorship to help ensure the success of the division now and in perpetuity. The Spotswood Lee Spruance and Joanne Louise Spruance Endowed Professorship in the Division of Infectious Diseases will both honor the legacy of former infectious diseases virologist, Spotswood \"Woody\" Spruance, Md and will help support faculty in infectious diseases. Woody completed his fellowship in infectious diseases at the University of Utah and was a faculty member for nearly forty years. Woody is a prolific investigator who has been the Principal i nvestigator on nearly 100 funded research grants and published in many high-impact publications. His research led to important discoveries in virology which have significantly impacted the standard of care for patients in Utah and across the world. The Spotswood Lee Spruance and Joanne Louise Spruance Endowed Professorship in the Division of Infectious Diseases will not only serve as a continual reminder of Woody's impact, but will also help support physician scientists within the d ivision investigating human virus diseases such as herpesvirus infections, human immunodeficiency virus (H iV) disease, influenza, hepatitis, the common cold, Zika virus, and Ebola virus infections. research funding from the National institutes of Health (NiH) and private associations has become increasingly competitive. While the University of Utah has a broad base of extremely talented basic and clinical scientists, there is a need for another nationally and internationally recognized virologist working in the area of oncogenic viruses to allow us to rise to the next level and acquire the critical mass necessary to initiate additional collaborations and successfully apply for a program project through the Ni H. The Spotswood Lee Spruance and Joanne Louise Spruance Endowed Professorship in the Division of Infectious Disease s will greatly enhance our ability to recruit such a highly talented individual. The benefits will be felt not only in the d epartments of Medicine and Biochemistry, where the current virologists work, but throughout the School of Medicine, enhancing our multidisciplinary achievements and the prestige of the academic enterprise at the University of Utah. Spotswood \"Woody\" Spruance and Joanne Spruance establish an Endowed Professorship in i nfectious d iseases 35 Anne G. o sborn, Md : Global Luminary in radiology While cable TV viewers might fall over themselves to be near d r. oz, serious radiologists find themselves at a loss for words when they line up to ask Anne o sborn, M d, to sign their copies of her landmark textbook, Osborn's Brain . Anne o sborn is as close as you get to a celebrity in the field of radiology - not just because she's published over 20 critically acclaimed books used to train neuroradiologists around the world, but because she has a sparkling personality and a true devotion to giving young physicians and researchers a leg up. Anne is a d istinguished Professor of r adiology at the University of Utah and holds the William H. and Patricia W. Child Presidential Endowed Chair Honoring Pioneering Utah Women in Medicine. She is also the 2004 recipient of the School of Medicine Alumni Association's d istinguished Service Award. Anne's extraordinary dedication to providing funding for educators and researchers is one of the reasons she is beloved in her community. She and her late husband, r onald Poelman, Jd, have been generous donors to the University. They have fully funded two endowed faculty positions at the University - the Hendrik and Ella May Perkins Poelman Endowed Professorship in English and the Anne G. o sborn and r onald E. Poelman Endowed Chair for Young Clinician investigators in imaging research. i n addition, she established the Neuroradiology Faculty r esearch Fund in the d epartment of r adiology and imaging Sciences and has included a planned estate gift for the fund. Anne has been a generous donor using blended giving techniques (lifetime giving and planned estate giving). Most recently Anne established the Anne G. o sborn, M d Endowed Chair in the d epartment of r adiology and i maging Sciences which is partially funded with lifetime gifts from Anne over five years using the tax savvy ir A charitable rollover technique. She then is supplementing the fund with a planned gift from her estate to fully endow the Chair. She also has estate gifts to establish three additional endowed faculty positions in the College of Fine Arts, in the Neurosciences, and in Neuroradiology. She was able to provide the generous planned gifts to the University by designating the University as a beneficiary on her retirement accounts which is a simple and tax efficient way to make a planned gift. r etirement assets are potentially subject to double taxation (estate and income tax) when passed to non- spouse heirs, but when donated to charity, such assets pass free of all taxation, allowing the full value of retirement proceeds to be used for the donor's charitable wishes. Anne hopes her generosity will encourage and inspire others to consider giving back to the University using similar charitable giving strategies, and she is excited to know that planned gifts will count toward the university's imagine New Heights Campaign goal. Anne is also a charismatic teacher. A quick search on YouTube reveals this as she demonstrates a digital radiology teaching tool called Statd x she helped to develop with fellow Utah faculty. She has had an illustrious career, notably becoming the first female president of the American Society of Neuroradiology. Her achievements have earned her the Gold Medal of the radiological Society of North America, where she served as First Vice-President and Chair of the r esearch and Education Foundation Board of Trustees.
