There is no other place I trust more for my regular health care. Dr. Walker's knowledge about the body is truly impressive and they offer a large variety of aids and treatments for whole body wellness. Highly recommend if you want to get to the root of your health problems! Suellen Wine 2022-07-17 This place is amazing. Normally you have to go to many different places to receive a regiment of care for a injury, NOT here. You have a team of people who coordinate your care. There is no lag time while waiting for one office to send over recommended treatment to another. The Chiropractor walks to the next room and speaks with the Physical Therapist or PA-C for regenerative injections, or vice-versa, to make sure your getting the best treatment as your condition changes. Everyone here is very friendly and caring. I recommend anyone suffering from back pain, neck pain, or needing physical therapy to check out Balance Wellspace.
