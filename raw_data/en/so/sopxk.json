Two of the most come models of health and healing are Western Medicine and Eastern Medicine. These two approaches are vastly You have a very profound question as to the role of physical therapists in opioid addiction. It reminded me of the very inspiring words of the APTA president, Dr. Sharon Dunn (American Physical Therapy Association [APTA], 2015). I would like to quote what she said: This relevant data about Native American substance abuse is just a remark that these communities still have a long way to go in terms of health and healing treatment, but it shows that even though they have communities ravaged by alcohol, drugs and diseases like smallpox they are still here and will make their voices heard. Alternative health approaches to health care are analysed using a broad range of of research to get various concepts and understanding of the CAM therapies. In 1986 Aakster did a research on how CAM therapies varied fro the traditional biomedical treatments. In his conclusion he found three models that suited medical perspective as listed below; Locura is a culture bound syndrome that affects Latin Americans and Hispanics, regardless of where they are born, in the United States or South America (Jilek 2001:5,9). Locura has also been documented in immigrants from the Caribbean Islands (Razzouk 2011:517). In Columbia, Locura is also known as \"ataques de locura\" madness attacks, it is attributed to a spell known as \"maleficio\". Locura is commonly associated with other culture bound syndromes thru out Central and South America, such as ataques de nervious (nervios) and possession syndromes (Pi\u00f1eros 1998:1425). Native American author, Mourning Dove, stated, \"What kept us going, was the knowledge that everything on earth has its purpose, every disease an herb to cure it, and every person a mission. That is the Indian theory of existence.\" (Mourning, 1990, p. 69) Histories that deal with health, illness, and medicine in America, often make passing mention of Native Americans as healers or sources of knowledge about medicine. Similarly, histories of Native-American cultures and early European contact pay attention only to health and healing with respect to these cross-cultural interactions. Many books and articles have been written on Native American medicine. However, there have been virtually no scientific studies done on tribal healing practices, undoubtedly due to the spiritual nature of the treatments. Some of these historical pieces of literature attempt to assess the impact of Native-American knowledge of New World herbs on the knowledge and practice of early-American elite physicians and botanists. Healing and medical practices of Native Americans has been obscured by time but there is anecdotal evidence available and competing perspectives about the true values of Native American healing practices From the beginning of my nursing endeavors, I knew that working at Broward Health will be my goal. My work towards it wasn't easy, but I hope that this healthy challenge will be rewarded one day. Whenever I could, I choose to have my clinical rotations at one of Broward Health System hospitals. My first three clinical rotations were on oncology floor at Broward Health, where I was exposed to patients with various and serious conditions. Despite the fact that most of these patients were suffering, they fought and had hopes in them that really made me going. My clinical rotations were not only interesting, but gave me necessary experience and strength to get through my nursing school. I've learned to be present in the moment for patient's emotional whether or now not you lead a bodily energetic subculture, a sedentary one, or someplace in between, you might frequently understand how important it is that your knees be functioning comfortably and be soreness free. The knees absolutely serve plenty of capabilities. Not completely do these endure the load of the physique; the knees are additionally essential for almost any movement. As such, it comes as no surprise that knee joint agony is a typical predicament, experienced by means of contributors of all a while, sizes, and origins. The knee joint is one of the strongest and most important joints in the human body. It allows the lower leg to move relative to the thigh while supporting the body's weight (Taylor, n.d.) as knee joint is one of the major weights bearing joint in the body. Knee joint plays an important role in our daily lives such as walking, running, sitting and standing. It allows physiological movement such as flexion and extension. The knee joint is also known as tibiofemoral joint. It is a synovial hinge joint formed between three bones which are the femur, tibia and patella (Taylor, n.d.). There are two rounded, convex processes which are known as condyles on the distal end of the femur. The distal end of the femur meets two rounded, concave condyles at the proximal end of the tibia (Tyalor, n.d.). A thick, triangular bone which is known as patella lies anterior surface between the femur and tibia. Western medicine is increasing the lives of many in different ways using advances in the medical field. Western medicine is the process of looking at the body like a machine it finds a problem and fixes that problem. Today Western medicine is superior and eastern medicine is considered taboo. Eastern medicine looks at the body as a garden and instead of giving you medication they try to start at the root of the problem by talking about what's going on in your life. Today, the medical world recognizes two tips of medicine, the conventional medicine known as Western and the Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM). Although, they are by logic completely opposites in practice the have some similarities. The first one, is accepted in most of the advance countries. Though, the second one is having a lot of attention not just from de common people but from the biomedical system as part of their usual treatments. That is why the differences and similarities between Chiropractic as part of the CAM world and the Biomedical Model are getting smaller and closer together. Complementary and Alternative medicine (CAM) consider all forms of therapies outside the field of medical practice. CAM is attracting more attention within the context of health care provision and health sector reform.Use of CAM remains common in developing countries and is increasing knowledge and concern in developed countries.Cultural beliefs and practices often lead self-care, home remedies or consultation with traditional healers particularly in far as in rural and Bedouin communities. (16) The University of Maryland Medical Center states that Herbal Therapy also called botanical medicine or phytomedicine, refers to using plant's, seeds, berries, leaves, barks, or flowers for medicinal purposes. Herbalism has a long tradition of use outside conventional medicine. It is becoming more mainstream as improvements in analysis and quality control, along with advances in clinical research, show the value of herbal medicine in treating and preventing diseases. Herbal medicine is a natural, non-toxic way to treat many conditions of ill-health. It is holistic, meaning it treats the whole person, embracing all levels of an individual: physical, mental, emotional and spiritual. Herbal medicines are widely preferred by some individuals all Physical therapy is the treatment of disease, injury, or distortion by physical methods such as massage, heat treatment, and exercise rather than by drugs or surgery. The goals are to help joints move better and to restore or increase your flexibility, strength, endurance, coordination, and balance. This essay will discuss the extent of agreement that physical therapy is vital to be used as non-surgical treatments by people experiencing back and neck pain from time to time. When exploring what is health, it looks at the idea of an individual being free from illness or injuries (World Health Organization 1948). WHO further explains that it is the state of complete: physical, mental, and social well-being and not the absence of disease or infirmity (health context, 2018) "}
