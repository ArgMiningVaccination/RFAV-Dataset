There are larger issues about data reproducibility and the methods used to come up with the now doubtful data. Also worth noting is that Potti is in no danger of displacing the current unofficial retraction record holder, [Joachim Boldt](http://www.retractionwatch.com/category/by-author/joachim-boldt-retractions/), whose 90 or so retractions "}
