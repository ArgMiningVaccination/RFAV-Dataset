Date Saturday, May 13, 2023 Time 3:00pm - 5:30pm Location Mount Pleasant Mansion 3800 Mt Pleasant Dr Philadelphia, 19121 Ecotherapist [Krista Nelson](https://www.philadelphiaecotherapy.org/blank-3) will lead a guided hike and meditation to help you rekindle your love of nature with the arrival of spring. Find strength and companionship in a community of fellow nature lovers. Krista's popular program \"Nature as Lover\" facilitates healing through five natural elements: fire, water, air, earth, and space. We will hike for about 2.5 miles on the Boxer's Trail, stopping to listen and closely observe the natural surroundings. Our journey will lead us to Randolph Creek, where we will spread out in seated positions at water's edge, and collectively meditate accompanied by the reassuring rhythmic sounds of the flowing water. We will join in with the sound of the creek with our own spontaneous humming and whistling and in this way, show our love for the water. Krista calls this practice of listening to water and reciprocating with sound, \"Creek Drinking\" (not literally of course!). This event will connect you to nature and develop your meditative practice. It will help you find your breath in tune with the creek's flow so you can let troublesome thoughts wash away downstream. Estimated distance: about 2.5 miles Level: varies (see above) Terrain: combination of flat open parkland and hilly trails IMPORTANT: We will leave a few minutes after the scheduled start time (3 pm).
