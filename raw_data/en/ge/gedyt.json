Take care of your body, your mind will thank you. \" Debbie Hampton Nature is full of transitions. The seasons change from summer to fall to winter to spring and can affect our health in subtle ways. Food habits, lifestyle and environmental pollutants have a major impact on your health and well-being. Extreme hot or cold conditions and drastic climate changes have an adverse effect on the body. Studies prove that a busy culture decreases your productivity, major contributor, to increasing poor health in people and is a strong cause of stress. That's why it is becoming extremely important to cleanse, purify and rejuvenate one's self in today's age. Our bodies and minds build up ama. (toxins, gunk that we cannot digest completely.) To clear the body's channels, fortify digestion, clear Ama and break harmful habits and their effect on the body, it is better to try seasonal detox. The practice of cleansing is considered an important part of an Ayurvedic lifestyle. Seasonal cleansing helps to reduce excess dosha from the preceding season and also helps to improve energy, and boost immunity, thus ensuring a transformed life. The seasonal cleansing, purification, and renewal process involve eliminating physical and emotional toxicities that have accumulated during the earlier months, allowing the mind-body to return to a natural state of balance and health. \"Ayurveda can be entitled to a way of living through nature.

Benefits of Ayurveda : - Detoxification - Strengthens Joint Tissues - Helps to Restore Balanced Sleep Cycles - Promotes Optimal Health - Improves Blood Circulation - Improvement of Energy Levels - Better Excretion System - Improved Body Functioning Detoxification Ayurveda treatment is gaining popularity across the world. For ages, Ayurveda has believed that our bodies are made of five elements - Prithvi (Earth), Teja (fire) Vayu (air), Aakash (space), and Jala (water). Different combinations of these five elements create doshas that are the main cause of any kind of physiological illness. - Vata dosha- Most crucial of the three doshas, Vata dosha causes painful ailments and diseases that can adversely affect your body and mind. - Pitta dosha- Gastrointestinal problems are common in people during the rainy season. There will be an excess accumulation of Pitta in the body. - Kapha dosha- Contamination in food and water during the rainy season worsens the kapha dosha, which further causes, cough, cold, allergies and other skin diseases. Detoxification of the body and soul is important to maintain that balance.
