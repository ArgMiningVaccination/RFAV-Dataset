But, you might be wondering, what exactly is a [yoga detox](https://bookretreats.com/s/yoga-retreats/detox-retreats), and what are the benefits? A yoga detox is a way to rid the body of harmful toxins. You can achieve this through juice fasting, practicing yoga asana's, meditation, and even incorporating things like steam baths, mud treatments, ayurvedic massage, and acupuncture. A detox retreat has the power to reduce stress, strengthen digestion, and eliminate harmful toxins from the body that have accumulated over time. The combination of therapeutic benefits provided by both juicing and yoga can increase your vitality and be absolutely life-changing. Now, don't confuse a yoga detox as being as the same thing as a drug and alcohol detox. A yoga detox program simply uses yoga exercises and a healthy cleanse (juicing/raw food) to help with digestive, endocrine, and lymphatic issues. Where are the majority of these toxins coming from that contribute to our chronic health conditions? You can thank stress, processed foods, sugar, and caffeine. These toxins can all take a major toll on our bodies and a yoga detox retreat can help us regain balance within our bodies. Need more balance? Need a reset?
