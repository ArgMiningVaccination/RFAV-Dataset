Thesis submitted to the University of Nottingham for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy SEPTEMBER 2015i Dedicated to the soul s of my parents ii Abstract This thesis comprises of the study performed on the extraction, isolation and structural characterisation of macromolecular component s from the three members of the family Cucurbitaceae . In particular, th e polysaccharides from C.moschata, C. maxima and C. pepo (butternut squash, zucchini and p umpkin , respectively ) and oil bodies from the seed s of C. pepo are selected on the basis of thei r antidiabetic potential. The study centred around structural characterisation of the polysaccharid es using hydrodynamical methods such as analytical ultracentrifugation (sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium) , viscometry and dynamic light scattering followed by the use of gas chromatography and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrophotometry for the assessment of monosaccharide composition. Bioactivity of these polysaccharides was also examined using complement fixation assay. Pumpk in seed oil bodies were extracted, isolated and characterised under various laboratory conditions to establish the zeta potential and size distribution of oil bodies in the solvent provided. Although the selection of the biomaterial for this study from the three species was based on their antidiabetic potential, other health benefits and practical applications are also associated with them. For example, the c haracterisation of these macromolecules could act as a stepping stone for the future investigation in therapeutics . These biomaterials can potentially be used in the pharmaceutical industry to act as a drug themselves or can be used as a part of any formulation or otherwise can be used as a nutraceutical compound. iii Acknowledgements There are no good words that can express my gratitude for my supervisors, Dr. Gary Adams and Professor Stephen Harding.

Herbal medicines are considered as a better replacement over Western medicines worldwide (Hunt et al., 2000 ). Members of the pu mpkin family are traditionally used by many countries such as the former Yugoslav Republics, Argentina, India, Brazil and America as a treatment against a number of diseases (Jacobo -Valenzuela et al., 2011b Cucurbit family The gourd family \"Cucurbi taceae\" is the family of flowering plants, belonging to the order Cucurbitales and containing 130 genera and 900 species of edible and ornamental plants. The gourd family or the Cucurbitaceae has the following hierarchy in plant kingdom. Kingdom Plantae, Phylum Magnololphyta Class Magnoliopsida Order Cucurbitales Family Cucurbitaceae 2 The cucurbit family includes the gourds, melons, squashes, and pumpkins (Jeffrey, 1980 ). Plants in this family are prostrate or they have climbing stems (tendrils) (Yadav et al., 2010 ) and require temperate to tropical weather conditions to grow. Depending on the specie s, the cucurbits can be cultivated either annually or perennially. The Cucurbitaceae include pumpkin, squashes, cucumb er, water melon, muskmelon etc . (Paris et al., 2006 ). The family has fast growing plants with an elongated stalk, palmate leaves, succulent stem and unisexual flowers. The fruit is mostly a multi -seeded berry with a fleshy core and hard skin. The seeds are flattened and oval shaped (Adams et al., 2011 ). The three widely grown species Cucurbita moschata Duchesne (Butternut , C. maxima Duchesne (Pumpkin) and C. pepo ( Zucchini) are grown for their high nutritious content, as well as for their monetary value (Paris et al., 2006 ). In the 16th century pumpkins and squashes were mainly cultivated in America . Today China and India are the top two leading countries in the production of cucurbits (Li et al., 2005 ). Ukrain e, US, Egypt, Mexico, Iran, Cuba, Italy, Turkey South Africa, Spain and Argentina are also the major producing countries for cucurbits (Paris and Brown, 2005 ). 3 1.2 Health Significance of Cucurbits Cucurbit s are rich in carotene, protein and carbohydrate (Du et al., 2 011a ). Cucurbita moschata is rich in pectin, carotene, vitamins and minerals (Noelia et al., 2011 ; Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2001 ). Cucurbita pepo. L is commonly known as Zucchini or Courgette squash and is rich in ascorbic acid oxidase, vitamin C and minerals (Lin and Varner, 1991 ; Biesiada et al., 2007 ). As reported by (Azizah et al., 2009 ), Cucurbita pepo contains 0 .06-7.4mg/100g of beta-carotene whereas C. mg/100g -carotene and C. moschata 0-17 mg/100g lutein. In addition to the carotenoids and gamma aminobutyric acids (GABA) found in the fruits (Adams et al., 2012 ; Nawirska - Olszaska et al., 2011 ) there are other biologically active ingred ients, which are found in pumpkins (Gossell -Williams et al., 2008 ) such as sterols, proteins and peptides, polysaccharides, vitamins, para -aminobenzoic acid and fixed oils (Il Jun et al., 2006 ; Jun et al., 2006a ). Pumpkin seed oil contains unsaturated fatty acids especially linoleic and oleic acid and tocopherols with a very high oxidative stability. Pumpkin seed oil is suggested to be a healthy addition towards the human diet and be potentially suitable for food and industrial applications (Stevenson, 2007 ). It has also been reported that components in pumpkin seeds such as trigonelline (TRG), nicotinic acid (NA), and D -chiro -inositol (DCI), have hypoglycemic properties and could be helpful in maintaining glycemic control (Adams et al., 2013 ). 4 In a study, the effect of a diet rich in extract of C. ficifolia fruit was investigated in diabetic rats. It appeared that a diet of 300 to 600 mg/kg of the body weight resulted in the significant reduction in blood glucose, glycosylated haemoglobin, and an increase in plasma insulin and total haemoglobin (Xia and Wang, 2006a ). In addition to the antidiabetic potential of polysaccharides from cucurbit family there are other health benefits also associated with crude extracts from seed and pulp of pumpkin fruit (Caili et al., 2007b ; Xia and Wang, 2006b ). The list includes hypocholestrole mic effect from pumpkin seed oil (Al-Zuhair et al., 1997 ), anti- mutagenic, anti -cancerous, anti -helminthic and anti -bacterial activities from crude pumpkin extracts, pumpkin seeds, pumpkin juice (Fu et al., 2006 ; Noelia et al., 2011 ). 1.2.1 Cucurbita moschata Cucurbita moschata is a seasonal crop that is consumed as a part of human and animal diets. In addition, C. moschata has been reported as a good source of pectin and non -pectin polysaccharides, protein, minerals, salts, carotene and vitamins (Jun et al., 2006b ). The squash of C. moschata is considered as a plant with medicinal properties such as hypoglycaemic and hypolipidemic effects (Noelia et al., 2011 ). In terms o f the medicinal potential associated with cuc urbit family , a major focus is given to its antidiabetic potential. Polysaccharides obtained specifically from C. moschata Dutch were, for example, tested and compared with Xiaoke, an antidiabetic Chinese medicine for the hypoglycemic properties in rats (Xiong and 5 Cao, 2001 ). Cucurbit polysaccharide gave rise to a reduction in hyperglycemia as well as improvement in hair , thirst and urination conditions as compare d to the non- polysaccharide fed group. The glycoprotein complex (PBPS) from C. moschata was tested on alloxan induced diabetic rats. It was reported that the rats fed with high and low doses of PBPS had low blood glucose level. The group of rats with higher dose of PBPS (1000 mg/kg of the body weight) had lower blood glucose level then the other group (500mg/kg of the bodyweight). The results were compared with the diabetic rats fed with Glibenclamide, an antidiabetic drug. Based on these results, it implies that the dose of PBPP can influence the effect of hypoglycaemia and also possesses the possibility for PBPP to be developed into new anti -diabetic agents (Li et al., 2005 ). The molecular weight of PBPS obtained from C. moschata has been estimated as 8700 Da using gel permeation chromatography (Song et al., 2012 ) However, in another study the molecular weight was calculated as 324 - 5000 Da using high performance size exclusion chromatography (Du et al., 2011a ). Monosaccharide composition of PBPS complex from C. mo schata , as reported in literature is given in Table 1 .1. The polysaccharide consists of galactose (86.4%) and glucose (13.6 %) (Song et al., 2012 ). However, the percentage of these two monosaccharides varies according to differe nt studies and the method of analysis employed for characterization . 6 Table 1.1: Monosaccharide composition of PBPS complex from C. moschata Monosaccharide Weight percentage (%) Reference source Glucose 13.6 (Song et al., 2012 ) Galactose 86.4 (Song et al., 2012 ) Glucose 1.0 (Du et al., 2011a ) Galactose 99 (Du et al., (Yang et al., 2007b ) Arabinose 10 (Yang et al., 2007a ) Glucose 22 (Yang et al., 2007a ) Rhamnose 3 (Yang et al., (Yang et al., 2007a 19 (Yang et al., 2007a ) PBPS has been isolated and studied from other plant sources. These complexes are associated with multiple health b enefits. For example, PBPS isolated from mushrooms has helped to improve condition of patients with oesophageal, gastric and lung cancer (Ng, 1998 ). The polysaccharide (PBPS) from Phellinus linteus has 7 promoted down regulation of the gene controlling human colorectal cancer (Song et al., 2011 ). Some of these PBPS work by inducing apoptosis of the cancerous cells (Umehara et al., 2012 ). Protein bound polysaccharide K from basidomycetes Coriolus versicolor is a biological response modifier and helps to induce cytotoxic activity in human natural killer cells (Pedrinaci et al., 1999 ). Additional studies have reported PBPS from basidiomycetes to possess antiherpetic properties and an ability to generate immuno -stimulating response in cancer (Eo et a l., 1999 ; Kug Eo et al., 2000 ; Caili et al., 2007a ). This study includes is olation and characterisation purified polysaccharide 1.2.2 Cucurbita pepo The zucchini or courgette belongs to the sub species C. pepo which is one of the largest and genetically and morphologically diversified sub species of the family Cucurbitaceae (Paris et al., 2003). The family is known for its monetary value (Gong et al., 2012). The oil -pumpkin ( Cucurbita pepo L .) and oil -pumpkin ( C. pepo L. var. Styriaca ) are extensively cultivated in Australia for production of oil. Even the by -product of this vegetable is also valuable and is consumed for animal feed (Ko\u00e1lov\u00e1 et al., 2009). This cucurbit is rich in the essential nutrients such as vitamin A, vitamin C, potassium, folate, fibre and fatty acids (Tanaka et al., 2013). The seed oil is also commercially important for the production of biodiesel (Schinas et al., 2009). This 8 oil is reported to be ric h in fatty acids and certain bioactive compounds such as phenols and Tocopherols (Nyam et al., 2009) and is effective against number of health problems (Younis et al., 2000). The pectin like polysaccharide extracted from C. pepo. L var. Styriaca , has been previously found to contain antitussive properties, when tested in pigs with no side effects as compared to the traditional medicines (Nos\u00e1ov\u00e1 et al., 2011). Pectin form this variety is also reported to have immunostimulating properties (Ko\u00e1lo v\u00e1 et al., 2013b). 1.2.3 Cucurbita maxima C. maxima Duchesne (Pumpkin), is one of the most highly cultivated and nutritious varieties of the cucurbit family. The components of C. maxima are reported to have several health benefits including anti -mutagenicity (Villase\u00f1or et al., 1996), antioxidant (Attarde et al., 2010), d iuretic (Muntean et al., 2013) and hepato - protective activities (Nidhi and Pathak, 2012). A study based on the compar ison of the nutritious component of cucurbits, C. maxima reported the highest carbohydrate and amino acid content among the three species ( C. maxima , C. pepo and C. moschata ) with its seed containing the highest levels of -carotene, although the fruit als o contains significant amounts of essential fatty acids, tocopherols and carotenoids (Kim et al., 2012). 9 Pumpkin seed is used as antihelmintic agent and as a diuretic agent (Mitra et al., 2009 ; Saravanan and Manokaran, 2012). These are rich in unsaturate d fatty acids, especially linoleic and oleic acid, and tocopherols with very high oxidative stability. Pumpkin seed oil is suggested to be a healthy addition towards the human diet and potentially suitable for food and industrial applications (Stevenson, 2 007). Various macromolecular components of the members of the pumpkin family have previously been used by the health and food industries. One such example is the use of C. maxima pulp powder as an adjuvant and a disintegrating agent for the mouth dissolvi ng tablets (Rishabha et al., 2010). Pumpkin pulp has been used for oligosaccharide production (Du et al., 2011a). Several phytochemicals -octadecatrienoic the leaves of cucurbits, and proteins from germinated seeds, ha ve been isolated (Stevenson et al., 2007). Chapter 3, 4, 5 and 6 includes details of the work that has been carried out as part of this study to identify the hydrodynamic behaviour , structure and bioactivity of C. moschata, C. maxima and C. pepo polysaccharide s in the given conditions. 10 1.3 Diabetes Mellitus: Aetiology and Prevalence Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder caused by multiple factors including disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism (Fowler, 2010 ). Diabetes is mainly characterized by hyperglycaemia due to dysregulation of glucose metabolism. In patients without diabetes, an increase in blood glucose trigger s the secretion of insulin by pancreatic islet beta cells (Adams et al., 2009 ) The insulin binds to insulin receptors located on cells (for example, muscle cells) and hence signals them to increase the rate of glucose uptake from the plasma into the cells. With the glucose level in blood comes back to normal , the amount of insulin in the blood again drops. Therefore, the root cause is the defect in insulin secretio n, insulin action, or both. In the absence of insulin, blood glucose levels would rise to dangerously high levels, often resulting in death. In diabetes Mellitus (DM), insulin levels are too low to reduce glucose levels in the plasma and consequently, hyperglycemia presents. (Adams et al., 2013 ) It may result in chronic dama ge and failure of various organs, especially the eyes, nerves, kidneys, heart, and blood vessels. Diabetes patients are at increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, end -stage renal disease lower -limb amputations and blindness (Harvey and Denise, 2011 ). Type 1 diabetes or insulin -dependent diabetes Mellitus (IDDM) usually develops in childhood and is characterized by the lack of insulin production. It is often categorized as autoimmune disease, whereby the immune system produces antibodies, which attach to the beta cells in the pancreas and destroy them, thus stopping insulin production. For this reason, the 11 patient becomes dependent on the external sources of insulin for surv ival (Yadav et al., 2009 ). Type 2 diabetes, or non -insulin -dependent diabetes Mellitus (NIDDM), is the most common form of diabetes, comprising 90% of the worldwide population of diabetic patients and arises in middle -aged people. Although these patients produce normal (or even high) levels of insulin in their blood and the insulin attaches normally to the receptors on cells, they exhibit a low rate o f cellular uptake of glucose in response to insulin (Peter et al., 2011 ). 1.3.1 Type 1 diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) Type 1 diabetes is caused by -cells destruction, and it will lead to absolute insulin deficiency (Cryer, 2008), and this type of diabetes only accounts for 5 -10% of those with diabetes ( American Diabetes Association , 2010) . Because T1DM patients cannot develop an absolute deficiency, they must depend on exogenous insulin (Atkinson, 2001 ). T1DM can be classified as immune -mediated di abetes (type 1A) and idiopathic diabetes (type 1B), and only a minority of patients with type 1 diabetes belongs to the latter one ( Imagawa, 2000) . Although these two forms of type 1 diabetes usually happen s in childhood, it can occur at any time in life, even in the 8th and 9th decades of life (Fowler, 2010). Type 1A occurs because of a cellular - mediated autoimmune destruction of the -cells. For type 1B involves permanent insulinopenia and ketoacidosis but there is no evidence of autoimmunity (Imagawa, 2006). 12 1.3.2 Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) T2DM patients have relative rather than absolute (type 1 diabetes) insulin deficiency, or insulin secretory defect (Kahn, 2003), and cons titutes more than 80% of all cases of diabetes (Raslova, 2010). The relative insulin deficiency will at least present initially, and often throughout the lifetime of patients (Kahn, 2003). Frequently this f orm of diabetes remains undiagnosed for many years , because the hyperglycaemia is often not enough severe to be noticed with classic symptoms of diabetes and it develops gradually. Although there are many causes of this form of diabetes, the specific etiol ogies until now are not known (American Diabetes Association, 2010). The clinically obese is usually seen in the majority of patients with T2DM, and obesity can cause insulin resistance in some degree. Patients are not obese by the traditional weight crite ria, and it is the abdominal part for patients to increase body fat ( Dunstan, 2002). Thus, exercise, weight loss and health lifestyle can make improvements in the disease state and for some patients reduce clinical symptoms (Simpson, 2003). Unlike T1DM, certain type 2 pharmacotherapies are useful in boosting insulin sensitivity as well as increasing production of -cell insulin (Rendell, 2000). Type 2 diabetes show strong genetic predisposition in comparison with type 1 diabetes, in that case, it suggests that the diagnosis should be taken in family members with family history of the type 2 diabetes (Frayling, 2007). Diabetes Mellitus is considered as a common, growing, costly, and potentially preventable public health problem. It is estimated that the n umber of people with diabetes will increase from 117 million in 2000 to 366 million in 2030 (Wild et al., 2004 ). The 13 prevalence of diabetes will impact on the health and finances within the UK, which will, in turn, impact on individuals, families and nations. The symptoms of diabetes itself, if managed in time, are not serious, but other severe pathological and functiona l changes may occur if the complications of diabetes are not addressed (Adams et al., 2011 ). There will be an increase in prevalence of diabetes by the year 2030 as estimated in the stud ies conducted by (Wild et al., 200 4; Shaw et al., 2010 ). Table 1. 2 lists a comparison for the prevalence of diabetes in the year 2000 and the projected prevalence in 2030. In both 2000 and 2030, the top three countries remain the same: India, China and U.S.A. with other countries such as Bangladesh, Brazil, Indonesia, Japan and Pakistan still in the top 10 list over the three decades (2000 to 2030). 14 Table 1. 2: List of countries with the highest numbers of estimated cases of diabetes for 2000 and 2030 (Wild et al., 2004 ) Ranking 2000 2030 Country People with diabetes (millions) Country People with diabetes (millions) 1 India 31.7 India 79.4 2 China 20.8 China 42.3 3 U.S. 17.7 U.S. 30.3 4 Indonesia 8.4 Indonesia 21.3 5 Japan 6.8 Pakistan 13.9 6 Pakistan 5.2 Brazil 11.3 7 Russian Federation 4.6 Bangladesh 11.1 8 Brazil 4.6 Japan 8.9 9 Italy 4.3 Philippines 7.8 10 Bangladesh 3.2 Egypt 6.7 At present, various insulin treatments are available, for example, insulin injections (Pickup et al., 2002 ), insulin pumps (Thompson and Duckworth, 2001 ; Bergenstal 15 et al., 2010 ), artificial pancreas (Jaremko and Rorstad, 1998 ; Hovorka et al., 2011 ) advances in stem cell research to produce insulin from embryonic stem cells (Lee et al., 2012 ), efforts to develop diabetic vaccines (Petrovsky et al., 2003 ; Harrison, 2008 ) traditional Chinese medicines and acupuncture (Ji et al., 2013 ). All these methods have their ow n limitations and physiological consequences. Therefore, it is very important to have alternative therapies and drugs. This includes dietary plants from the Cucurbitaceae family (Adams et al., 2011 ). 16 1.4 Pharmacological importance of polysaccharides Polysaccharides play crucial roles in the regulation of various biological processes. These biopolymers are expressed by living cells directly or carbohydrate component of glycoproteins, glycolipids in order to carry out multiple biological activities (Niture and Refai, 2013 ; Malafaya et al., 2007 ). Polysaccharides are generally used in the pharmaceutical industry as excipient s during drug manufacture based on their biophysical properties. Such as hydrophilic properties, emulsification and an ability to change viscosity with respect to the solvent etc (Beneke et al., 2009 ). Naturally extracted polysaccharides are considered as an alternative over synthetic polymer s during the development of a controlled drug release system because of their biocompatibility, biodegradability, low toxicity and low cost. Furthermore, the possibility of fabrication of polysaccharides, because of the presence of wide range of molecular weights and varying composition, has drawn considerable attention for their use in pharmaceutical industry (Br\u00f8ndsted and Hovgaard, 1996 ; Villanova et al., 2015 ). Nonetheless, despite an infinite list of therapeutic properties, polysaccharides are barely used as an independent source of treatment in the pharmaceutical industry due to a number of reasons. Th ese include , complications in the isolation, purification and structural characterization due to their complex structure, less 17 reproducib ility and lack of information about structure and function relationships (Franz et al., 1995 ). The knowledge of the structural parameters of an extracted biological polymer is essential before they are introduced to the physiological environment. Thus, the use of different techniques, for the extraction and characterization of precision, is a prerequisite for any further development. 1.4.1 Pharmacological importance of pumpkin polysaccharides for diabetes Recent scientific studies have proven that the seed and pulp of pumpkin fruits were successful in reducing hyperglycaemia in diabetic rats and rabbits as well as in humans with type 1 and 2 diabetes Mellitus ( Shi et al., 2003 ; Fu et al., 2006 ). Table 1.3 contains summary of the experiments performed to identify hypoglycaemic potential of polysaccharide extracted from a variety of cucurbits. 18 Table 1.3: A summary of dose related hypoglycaemic activity of cucurbit polysaccharide s Cucurbit Dose Activity Reference moschata polysaccharide complex 100mg/kg and 500 mg/kg of rat's body weight Reduction in blood glucose level Li et al ., 2005 C. pepo L var.

During the therapeutic process, there were 30 type 2 diabetes Mellitus ( T2DM ) patients with 17 males and 13 females in a treatment group, and 20 T2DM patients (9males, 11 females) in control group. The age, course of disease and condition in both groups were similar, so the results of this clinical experime nt were comparable. After treatment course 1, which lasted for 4 weeks, the plasma test of fasting plasma glucose level (FPG) and 2 hour post load plasma glucose (2-h PG), and urination for 24 h were compared. In comparing these groups, there is a reduction in both plasma glucose (including FPG and 2 h -PG and urination in the treatment group. This showed that the pumpkin polysaccharide granules cannot only control hyper glycaemia in T2DM but also have an effect compared to Xiaoke pills. Polysacchari des extracted from pumpkin have been reported to have hypoglycaemic activity. Preliminary investigations proved that a pumpkin -rich diet has pharmacological activity in reducing blood glucose (Li, 2003 ; Tong et al. ; 2008 ; Yoshinari et al., 2009 ). Another experiment performed by (Li et al., 2005 ) rats were given different doses of protein bound polysaccharide (PBPP) extracted from pumpkin. All rats were divided into groups. Group 1 (normal rats), Group 2 diabetic untreated rats, Group 3 diabetic rats treated with 1000 mg/kg of body weight of PBPP, Group 4 diabetic rats trea ted with 500 mg/kg body weight of PBPP, Group 5 diabetic rats treated with 20 mg/kg 20 of body weight of glibenclamide. All groups were tested for serum insulin, blood glucose and tolerance. It was observed that group 3 and 4 (PBPP treated groups) fasting glucose level was significantly lower than those untreated diabetic rats (group2) as well as glibenclamide rats (group 5). Additionally, the Group 3 (1000mg/kg) s howed excellent hypoglycaemic results compared to group 4 (500mg/kg). This suggested that the dose of PBPP can influence the effect of hypoglycaemic properties as well as it also shows that PBPP has the potential to be developed into new antidiabetic agen ts. Another study ( Yoshiniari et al., 2009 ) determined the hypoglycaemic effects of a pumpkin paste and its components by measuring the oral glucose tolerance and serum lipid levels in non -obese type 2 diabetic goto -Kakizaki (GK) rats. There were two se ts of experimental design . In experiment 1, the rats were fed with a mixed diet containing 1 % pumpkin ( 37.5g of freeze dried pumpkin paste was fed to the rats ). It was observed that pumpkin paste containing diet maintained lower glucose level in oral glucos e tolerance test. It was found that the effective components in this diet were trigonelline (TRG) and nicotinic acid (NA ). In second set of experiment, the GK rats were fed with diet contai ning e quimolar amounts (0.05%) of TRG and NA . The diets were admin istered for 43 d ays. Serum, liver and kidney samples were collected for analysis. Feeding a diet containing TRG and NA respectively improved glucose tolerance. Improved serum insulin level and improved serum and liver triglyceride levels were observed in r ats fed with TRG and NA containing diet as compared to the group without this diet. Also it was observed 21 that there was a decrease in liver fatty acid synthase (FAS), and higher activity of liver carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT) and glucokinase (GLK) in the T RG- and NA-fed GK rat as compared to the control group . This study suggested that TRG and NA contributes towards the regulation of these enzymes which in turn is linked to the suppression of triglyceride accumulation and diabetes. Water -extracted pumpkin polysaccharides possess superior hypoglycaemic properties compared to the antidiabetic drug glibenclamide in alloxan -induced diabetic rats (Zhang, 2004 ). In (Zhang, 2004) study , polysaccharides were extracted from different kinds of pumpkin and difference between the hypoglycaemic activities were evaluated using alloxan induced diabetic rats as a model. The rats were fed with low carbohydrate diet (LCT) and high carbohydra te diet (HCT) (25 and 5 0mg/kg of body weight). The measurements were taken about the plasma glucose of pre - treatment, 7h post -treatment and 11h post -treatment. It was observed that although the total carbohyd rate of HCT pumpkin was higher but there was not significant difference in the overall h ypoglycaemic effect of both type of polysaccharides. One of the effective variable in this study could be the change in the polysaccharide content during the fruit development. However, it is not clear if these detai ls were considered during this study. The hypoglycaemic and hypolipidemic potential of a pumpkin -rich diet is linked to the presence of antioxidants, flavonoids and polysaccharides in pumpkin (Sedigheh et al., 2011 ). This group administrated dried powder of pumpkin ( 0.6g/kg, 1g/kg and 2g/kg of body weight) to the alloxan induced diabetic rats. Glibenclamide was used 22 as positive control. It was observed that the l ower dose pumpkin was more effective as compared to the glibenclamide and high dose of pumpkin in terms of reduction in glucose, triglycerides, LDL and CRP (p < 0.05). it was concluded that pumpkin polysaccharide s increase the activity of enzymes superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase (antioxidant enzymes that control hyperinsulinemia) and therefore is linked to the hypoglycaemic effect of pumpkin polysaccharides (Sedigheh et al., 2011 ). This study supports the hypothesis of hypoglycaemic potential of pumpkin . However, there are many biologically active component present in pumpkin and role of any specific component in reduction of diabetes was not identified during this study. The PBPS has been found to contain polysaccharide and protein in the approximate ratio 4:1 (Shan et al., 20 09). Such polysaccharide s can be isolated from the water soluble substances of pumpkin fruits (PBPP) . For example (Li et al., 2005 ) separated and isolated different polysaccharide fraction s from chromatography column and examin ed their effect in diabetic rats. The initial dose was set to be 500mg/kg of body weight. It was also observed that in diabetic mice the protein - bound polysaccharide (PBPS) was more effective in controlling the glucose tolerance and serum levels compared to the drug glibenclamide. Moreover, an increase in the dose of the PBPS (1000mg/kg body weight) enhanced its hypoglycaemic activity (Li et al., 2005 ). 23 1.4.2 Pectic polysaccharides and pumpkins Pectin s are complex polyuronides which are mainly composed of covalently linked three homogala cturonan, Willats et al., 2006 ). The linear region is made of 1, 4 - -D-galactouronan and the ramified region forms the branches (Popov and Ovodov, 2013 ). Figure 1.1 : Basic structure of the pectin backbone (Sriamornsak, 2003b ) 24 According to UN Food and Agriculture Organization and European Union, a typical pectin is considered to contain approximately 65% galactouronic acid (Canteri et al., 2012b ). The p ectin c omposition varies depending on the plant source and meth od of extraction. The g alactouronan (galactouronic acid) content of pectin varies in the degree of methyl esterification and molecular weight . The rhamnogalacturonan backbone can also vary in their branching structure and composition (Popov and Ovodov, 2013 ). The association of pectin with protein has be en cited in the literature. As an example, the extinsin protein in cotton and beetroot has been reported to be associated with pectin (Nunez et al., 2009). Pectin polysaccharides also exhibit a wide range of molecular weigh t, usually ranging from 10kDa to 100kDa depending on the source from which pectin has been extracted (Izydorczyk et al., 2005 ). The variation in the structure of the extracted pectin molecule contributes towards its functional properties. There are reports of pecti n inducing complement activation. The higher complement activity is associated with the ramnified \"hairy (branched) region \" and to some extent arabinogalactans of pectin as compare to the smooth backbone (Inngjerdingen et al., 2006 ; Yamada, 1994 ; Nergard et al., 2004 ). The complement activation property of polysaccharides from the three selective cucurbits is part of this study and has been discussed in detail. Therefore, p umpkins are r ich in pectin - a dietary fibre or \"non -digestible carbohydrate (NDC) et al., 2007b ; Karklelien et al., 2008 ) and the 25 consumption of pectin in the diet controls glycaemic lev els and reduces the need for insulin in diabetic patients (Guillon and Champ, 2000 ). The gel forming property of pectin s also helps in the reduction of human cholesterol levels. This property is highly important for type 1 and type 2 dia betes patients (Giacco et al., 2000 ). Pectic polysaccharide can be helpful in delaying gastric emptying by providing bulk to the stomach by their gel forming and viscosity enhancing properties (Fissore et al., 2007a ) because a delay in digestion sl ows down post -prandial glucose uptake which results in lower blood glucose and insulin levels (Slavin, 2008 ). Additionally, the metabolism of gel forming fibre (pectin) involves loss of excessive bile salt and fat in stool secretion. During metabolism of pectin rich diet, neutral steroid loss increases and availability of dietary fat for synthesis of cholesterol decreases. Furthermore, the release of methanol due to break down of high methoxy pectin also slows down the cholesterol synthesis (Jenkins et al., 1975 ; Jenkins, 1979 ; Kravtchenko et al., 1992 ). In addition to hypoglycaemic and hypolipidemic activities, pectins from medicinal plants are associated with anti -tumorigenic events. Briefly, (Liu et al., 2001 ) have reported the structural modification of pectin at colon intestine interface exposing the pectin site within pectin with a possibility of some absorption in intestine. The modified pectin is considered to be responsible for the inhibitory effects on fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signal transduction . This process facilitates embryonic developmental processes and promotes maintenance of homeostasis in adults. Disturbance in this process is linked to car diovascular disease and cancer. Pectin inhibit carcinogenesis in the colon by increasing apoptosis, slowing the proliferation 26 of colonocytes, reducing the activity of beta glucouronidase, stimulating the growth of bifidobacteria and producing short chain fatty acid. The s tructural resemblance of pectin with heparin (which can be an inducer or inhibitor for FGF signalling process) allow s pectin to inhibit binding of FGF to its receptor and thus exerts its cholesterol lowering effect (Liu et al., 2001 ). Because of the structural resemblance to heparin, pectin can also be used as an anti - coagulant in combination with sulphate (Bae et al., 2009 ). Pectin has also been reported to induce apoptotic activity (activity of cell death) in humans (Jackson et al., 2006 ; Gunning et al., 2009 ). This apoptotic activity is considered as linked to the complex side chains of pectin. Further structural investigation for the anti -cancerous activity of pectin is required (Willats et al., 2006 ). There are reports that active components (enzymes and proteins) (Okada et al., 2010 ) from pumpkin seeds and aerial parts of the plant (Saha et al., 2011 ) are involved in tumour suppression activities but there is no study that directly links pumpkin pectin with their apoptosis . In an experiment to eval uate the antitumor activity on Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma model in mice , (Saha et al., 2011) compared aerial parts of C. maxima (MECM) with 5-Fluorouracil (standard anti tumor drug). They compared 200mg/kg and 400mg/kg of bodyweight of MECM with 20mg/kg of body weight of 5-Fluorouracil . The MECM extract increased Glutathione effect and reduction of tumour volume by lowering the amount of ascetic nutritional fluid for tumour . It was 27 concluded that MECM had significant anticancer activity which may be due to its cytotoxicity and antioxidant properties . However, this study included the whole aerial part of the plant and does not specify which component from the shoot of the plant is responsible for this effect. 28 1.5 Seed Oil bodies, significance and applications Plant seed oil bodies are globular structures composed of a central core of lipids (triacylglycerol) surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer which has oleosin, caleosin and stereoleosin) (Murphy and Cummins, 1989 ). In plants, lipid droplets from seeds exist in conjunction with other proteins, predominantly oleosins, steroleosins and caleosins and are termed as oil bodies (Shimada and Hara -Nishimura, 2010). These tiny structures may vary in size from 0.5 - 3m depending on the type of t he plant (Jolivet et al., 2004; Frandsen et al., 2001; Tzen et al., 1993). The central core region is formed by neutral triacylglycerol and steryl esters which are surrounded by a single layer of ph ospholipids (Figure 1.2) Figure 1.2: A diagrammatic presentation of an oil body with triacylglycerol (TAG) matrix enclosed by a monolayer of phospholipids (PL) with oleosin (OL), caleosin (CAL), & steroleosin (ST) inserted on the outer surface (Tzen, 2012). 29 These phospholipids have their acyl chains inserted in the neutral core region (De Domenico et al., 2011). It is proposed that the oil bodies evolved due to the accumulation of neutral lipids in the intra bilayer of the endoplasmic reticulum. These neutral lipids detached later on to form oil body core structure and later on coated by proteins (Figure 1.3) (Jolivet et al., 2011). Figure 1.3 : A schematic presentation of the oil body developmen t and maturation from rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) & post germination degradation by lipase (Huang, 1992) Besides seeds, oil reservoirs are also found in roots, pollen, flowers and stem in plants (Huang, 1992; Tzen et al., 1992).These reservoirs are used during various metabolic events starting from germination in seeds till the formation of fully gro wn plant (Frandsen et al., 2001; Theodoulou and Eastmond, 2012) . 30 Oil bodies do not only exist as energy depots b ut they are also involved in several other functions. Oil bodies are considered to be involved in the control of hormonal balance, stress as well as pathogen resistance (Chapman et al., 2012) . The seed lipid bodies are different from any other storage orga ns in plants. The presence of structural proteins prevents coalescence of lipid droplets. Moreover, the unique folded structure of seed lipids increases surface area and provides easy access for lipase to reach triacyl glycerol (TAG). These lipids are des tined to mobilize in future therefore, presence of oil bodies in several discrete small assemblies facilitate their future consumption. This is in contrast to the presence of a single large subcellular globule in white adipose tissue, in which the main pur pose of the stored fatty acid is insulation or long term storage. Furthermore, the seed oil bodies are different from oil globules from the pulp of olive, oil palm, and avocado, in which the TAG are not meant to be mobilized (Huang, 1992). Oil bodies can maintain their structural integrity in vivo (in cytoplasm) and in vitro. This structural integrity is provided by the phospholipid layer and the proteins attached. Oleosin are the major proteins while caleosins and stereoleosins are the considered as the minor oil body proteins. This coating acts as a surfactant and allows the hydrophobic core to exist as an independent entity within the hydrophilic environment. Proteins present on oil bodies are considered to provide them structural integrity (Tzen, 2012) . Oil body proteins each oleosin consists of three structural domains, including an amphipathic NHZ -terminal domain, a central hydrophobic domain, and an -helical domain at or near the COOH -31 terminus. These secondary structures apparently enabl e the protein to reside stably on the surface of the oil bodies (Tzen et al., 1993). The conservative central hydrophobic domain of approximately 70 residues is apparently responsible for the anchorage of the proteins on the surface of oil bodies (Tzen 201 2). Steric hindrance and electronegative repulsion is the root cause of structural integrity provision by these proteins to oil bodies. The unique structure of oil bodies and stability under various environmental conditions have made them attractive for various biotechnological applications such as being used as emulsifying agents in the food industry, a source of expression of recombinant proteins, and a vehicle to transport probiotics in food products to increase the nutritional value (Bhatla et al., 2010 ). In principle, the Food and D rug industr ies can use the existing natural protection of the oil bodies to obtain a product that has improved stability during storage, transport, and utilization. The oil bodies serve as a better, healthier and natural emulsifier that allows additional nutritional benefits (contai n polyunsaturated fatty acids and vitamins) with no side effect in the product (Harada et al., 2002). Purified oil bodies are currently used in the formulations of vaccines, personal care products and animal feed. The oil bodies serve as a healthier and na tural emulsi on, that allows additional nutritional benefits (contain polyunsaturated fatty acids and vitamins) with no side effect in the product (Harada et al., 2002 ). Oil bodies are used as a clouding agent in juices and also ser ve as a lesser saturated fatty acid source in butter (Berr y et al., 2005). Oil bodies can be used to express recombinant 32 protein in microorganisms by the fusion of the foreign protein to oleosin (Chiang et al., 2005a ) Oil bodies can act as an adjuvant in vaccines furthermore; these tiny particles can act as a carrier to transport an active ingredient to host. They are also used as a carrier for flavouring and chelating agents in tooth pastes (Deckers et al., 2004 ; Deckers et al., 2003 ). Artificial oil bodies can be used for encapsulation of probiotics (Bhatla et al., 2010 ). However, besides their health benefits , the potential of pumpkin seed oil bodies remained unexp lored. Pumpkin seed oil bodies are neither characterized physically nor have they been used in any industrial applications. The Pumpkin seed oil and oil bodies have hypocholesterolemic (Nyam et al., 2009 ; Gossell al., 2004 ), as well as anti-cancerous properties arthritis and anti-diabet ic properties (Tsai, 2006 ; Jian et al., 2005 ; Tarrazo -Antelo et al., 2014 ; Tomar et al., 2014 ; Xanthopoulou et al., 2009 ; Zuhair et al., 2000 ; Carbin et al., 1990 ; Teugwa et al., 2013 ; Mitra et al., 2009 ; Caili et al., 2006 ; Hong, 2009 ). Pumpkin seed oil bodies (PSOs) have also been reported to be effective in improving plasma lipid profiles (Gossell -Williams, 2008). A mixture of pumpkin and flax seeds has been found effective against hyperlipidemia (Makni, 2010). Pumpkin seed oils (PSOs) have been formerly used and found safe for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (Hong, 2009) and when used alone and/or in conjunction with phytosterol -F can block t estosterone induced prostatic growth in 33 rats (Tsai, 2006). The successful utilization of pumpkin oil bodies requires a detailed understanding of their structural performance under different environmental conditions. In current study, an investigation of the influence of pH, ionic strength, and change in temperature on the properties and stability of oil bodies in their native form has been carried out. 34 1.6 Bioactivity of polysaccharides as immunomodulators The polysaccharides from cucurbits were also tested for their immunmodulatory activities during this study in addition to the structural related investigations. Compounds that have the ability to induce or suppress the immune system are classified as immunomodulators (Tzianabos, 2000a ). This includes proteins, protein -polysaccharide complexes, lipopolysaccharides and polysaccharides from various sources (Snyderman and Pike, 1975 ; Tzianabos, 2000a ) for example, bacteria, fungi, yeast (Schepetkin and Quinn, 2006 ) and from some highly evolved plants like mushrooms (Wasser, 2002 ; Zhang et al., 2007 ) and water pears (Ghildyal et al., 2010 ), Aloe vera (Im et al., 2005 ). Certain immunmodulators can also be used to activate the immune system without any induction or suppress ion of the immune system. Certain phyto extracts, for example saponins, alkaloids, flavonoids, glycosides, polysaccharides can be used to activate the immune system to naturally fight against any disease (Pragathi et al., 2011 ). Examples of the polysaccharides that act as an terms of toxicity plant polysaccharides are comparatively nontoxic immunmodulators with significantly minimal side effects in contrast to synthetic compounds and bacteri al polysaccharides (Schepetkin and Quinn, 2006 ). 35 In vitro methods can be applied to evaluate the immunmodulatory potential of polysaccharides (Franz et al., 1995 ). Such assays work by investiga ting the properties of innate immunity, specific immune responses and systematic and mucosal adjuvant activity of the immune system (van Dijk et al., 1999 ). During the course of action as an immunodulator, the polysaccharide promotes phagocytic activity of macrophages and granulocytes. This involves release or improved production of the tumour necrosis factor, interleukins and cytokines (Paulsen, 2001 ; Kumar et al., 2011 ). Pectic from various plant sources such as Biophytum petersianum Klotzsch (an African plant and a member of the Oxalidaceae family) (Inngjerdingen et al., 2008 ), ), Cirsium (a Chinese plant) (Khramova et al., 2011 ) are considered as bioactive and have been reported to boost the immune system. Furthermore, the pectic polysaccharides from C. pepo. L . have been reported to possess antitussive activity (Nos\u00e1ov\u00e1 et al., 2011 ). The structural backbone and branches of pectins are considered to be connected to the immunomodulato ry effects. The immunological response can be induced or suppressed based on the degree of esterification, ramification and variation in galactouronic acid content ( Figure 1.4 ) (Popov and Ovodov, 2013 ). 36 Figure 1.4 : Immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive effects of plant polysaccharides depend upon their method of extraction which leads to the available branching pattern (Popov and Ovodov, 2013 ) Components of pumpkin possess a potential to induce biological activities Crude extracts from ( C. pepo . L) the fruits an d seed have been investigated for their immunodulating activities (Winkler et al., 2005 ; Jafarian et al., 2012 ). Prebiotic activity of polysaccharide from C. moschata has also been ob served by (Du et al., 2011b ). 1.6.1 Complement fixation to determine bioactivity As a part of the innate immunity pathway, 20 complement serum proteins exist in serum and form the complement system. A list of all the components of the compleme nt system is given in Table 1.4. These proteins circulate in an inactive form in the absence of infection. As soon as the presence of any pathogen is detected these proteins are activated. These proteins interact with each other to form various pathways of complement activation 37 to kill pa thogens (Murphy et al., 2008 ). There are three pathways of complement activation 1- Classical pathway which is antibody activated 2- Alternative pathway which is activated by pathogen only 3- Lectin pathway activated by Lectin type proteins that recogniz e polysaccharides on any pathogen surface. In the complement system, proteolysis of mostly one protein leads to the activation of other protein. These proteins normally exist as Zymogens. Zymogens become enzymatically active upon exposure to pathogens to c leave in order to activate them in pathway (Murphy et al., 2008 ). This system induces non -specific host defense and mediates inflammation (Alban et al., 2002 ). The complement system acts as a bridge bet ween innate (classical) pathways to adaptive pathway through binding of C1q to the Fc region of immune complexes (Caroll and Prodeus, 1998 ). 38 Table 1.4 : Functional protein classed in the complement system (adapted from (Murphy et al., 2008 ) Activity Protein Binds to the antigen - antibody complexes & surface of pathogen C1q Binds to glycans on microbial H I P CD59 39 Plant polysaccharides are recognized by certain specific receptors ( Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), CD14, complement receptor 3 known as or aMh2 integrin), scavenger receptor, dectin -1 and mannose receptor) that are present on the surface of macrophages during the initial phase of the immune response. Polysaccharide receptor binding activates a signaling cascade within the cell that allows production of pro -inflammatory cytokines (Gordon, 2002 ; Schepetkin and Quinn, 2006 ; Snyderman and Pike, 1975 ; Rice et al., 2002 ). Complement inhibition and activation, both can be useful physiologically for example, during organ transplantation tissue damage can be avoided with the inhibition of complement system (Marsh et al., 1999 ) whilst complement activation can be useful to induce host immunit y (Murphy et al., 2008 ). The complement fixation assay is a useful method to measure the immunmodulatory effect of a substance, although this assay, does not discriminate between activation and inhibition of the complement cascade because both res ult in inhibition of hemolysis (Alban et al., 2002 ). Inhibition of hemolysis involves binding of polysaccharide to the antigen -antibody complex and prevention of the series of events that leads to breakdown of r ed blood cells. In the absence of polysaccharides, antibodies attach to the antigen through the C1q region of the C1 complex and generates C3 convertase (Murphy et al., 2008 ). This initiates a series of events leading to hemolysis. Polysaccharide binding to the antigen -antibody 40 complex prevents breakdown events after C3 convertase is released thus preventing breakdown of red blood cells. It has been reported by (Michaelsen et al., 2000 ) that var iation in the incubation time can help to distinguish between activation and inhibition. While activation requires time for building the cascade, inhibition occurs immediately and it is therefore, possible to distinguish the two mechanisms simply by omitti ng the pre -incubation. The pectic substances are reported to be mostly involved in complement activation. (Inngjerdingen et al., 2006 ; Alban et al., 2002 ). As the polysaccharides under investigation have shown structural properties close to pectic substances (section 6.3.2 and 6.3.3), complement activation was selected to check bioactivity. 1.7 Over all aim and objective s The aim of th is work was to extract the natural biomaterials (oil bodies and polysaccharides) from the three selected species of the cucurbit family under natural or close to natural extraction and purification conditions and to characterize their solution structure in an environment that can mimic the natural phys iological conditions at the lab scale. The cucurbits used in this study were C. moschata, C. maxima and C. pepo . The hydrodynamic characterization and evaluatio n of the bioactivity for these cucurbits have never been done before. Health s ignificance associated with squashes as mentioned in the literature mostly includes the activity associated with the whole fruit or pulp extract. In few cases , 41 where biopolymer has been purified such as polysaccharide or protein bound polysaccharide , a brief description about their structure is provided. Hence knowledge about their structure and function is limited . A well -defined basic structure can pave way to the development of more complex structure in future. For example; if these polysaccharides will be used in pharmaceutical industry as an antidiabetic agent, they will be subjected to various stresses, complex processes and probably will be used in conjunction with other compounds synthetic or biologically derived compounds . Furthermore, certain in vitro testing will be required in order to assess in vivo behaviour of these polysaccharide s before they can be classified as a safe drug for human consumption . Therefore, an understanding of basic structure of these components is vital , prior to their use in health industry. Characterisation of the oil bodies in various environmental conditions and evaluation of the hydrodynamic behaviour of intact and fractionated polysaccharide s provide a number of possibilities for tailoring and modification for further application in futur e. Current study in fact can serve as a building block for further research using cucurbit macromolecular components. The main objective was to evaluate the hydrodynamic parameters using analytical ultracentrifugation, dynamic light scattering, viscometry, gas chromatography and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrophotometry in the given conditions (pH, temperature and salt concentration). Additionally, the study also aimed to evalu ate the immuno -activity of these polysaccharides with the help of the complement fixation assay. 42 Information collected about the cucurbits components, through all the parameters measured during this study can be helpful to provide valuable information abo ut the extraction conditions and structure of the biomaterial obtained from the three specific members of the cucurbit family . This information can also be used in future for the development of natural product based medicines . 43 Chapter 2: Analytical methods for the investigation of polysaccharides 2.1. Viscosity A measure of the resistance to the flow of a liquid is the viscosity (Van Holde, 1985 ; Harding, 1997 ). To briefly explain the concept of viscosity (Van Holde, 1985 ), we can consider a liquid between two parallel plates. One of these plates is stationary and other one is moving in the 'x' direction with velocity 'v' (Figure 2.1). As the plate moves the layer of the liquid in contact with the plate will also move. This results in the movement of the rest of the layers of the liquid. Resistance to this movement (flow) is measured by viscosity (). Figure 2.1: An illustration for the shear experienced by liquid flowing between two plates (one fixed, one moving) in the direction \"x\" with velocity \"y\" . Adapted from (Van Holde et al., 2006 ). 44 The liquid between the two plates experiences 'deformation' or 'shear'. The 'shear strain' at any point can be referred to as dx/dy. The force per unit cross section area required to push one of the two plates in the x direction is known as the shear stress. As long as this stress is maintained, the shear rate of the liquid remains constant. For liquids classified as \"Newtonian\", = . d/dt (dx/dy)= of the liquid (g.cm-1.s-1 or Poise unit). dx/dt = velocity of the liquid at height y. Thus, the viscosity is the ratio of the shear stress to the gradient in the fluid velocity, \"shear rate\". The ratio of viscosity of solut ion to the viscosity of the solvent is known as the relative viscosity. ; = 0 (2.2) As it is a ratio, relative viscosity has no units . The specific viscosity is given by : = 1 = ( 0)/ 0 (2.3) 45 The specific viscosity and relative viscosity both depend upon the solution viscosity and the concentration of the solution. The \"reduced\" viscosity is given by = / = (1)/ (2.4) The unit for reduced viscosity is ml /g. Reduced viscosity indicates the solution viscosity increase per unit of solute concentration. In addition, a further parameter known as the \"inherent\" viscosity provides a further way of concentration e ffects. =( )/ (2.5) To eliminate the effects of non ideality (which disappear at \"infinite dilution\") we define the limits of reduced viscosity as the macromolecular solute concentration approaches zero as the intrinsic viscosity [] (Morris et al., 2001 ). The Huggins (equation 2.6) (Huggins, 1942 ) and Kraemer ( equation 2.7) approaches provide convenient extrapolations, and their common intercept at c=0 yields [] (Harding, 1997 ), exemplified in Figure 2.2. 46 0.0000 0.0005 0.0010 0.0015 Huggins Kramer Viscosity red,inh, [ Concentration (g/ml) Figure 2.2: An example of Huggins and Kramer plot to calculate intrinsic viscosity from intercept of the plot for polysaccharide extracted from Pumpkin in phosphate buffer saline (pH 7.0, I=0.1) The Huggins equation is = [] (1+ [].)

(2.7) From Huggins: [] = 0( ) = 0 ( / ) (2.8) From Kraemer: 47 [] = 0( )= 0[( )/ )] (2.9) For very low concentrations, the Solomon Ciuta, approach , which is a combination of Huggins and Kraemer , can also be used. []=[22()] (2.10) The intrinsic viscosity of a macromolecule is a function of its shape ) and specific volume v s (ml/g) (Van Holde, 1985 ). []= (2.11) A shape factor ( of 2.5 represents a rigid sphere and any deviation from spherical shape will have > 2.5. The swollen specific volume v s (ml/g) = +( 0) = . (2.12) where\"hydration \" which is the (time -averaged) amount of water or solvent associated (through non -covalent interaction) with the macromolecule. is the partial specific volume (anhydrous volume per unit anhydrous mass). For non -spherical macromolecules the intrinsic viscosity can be used to estimate the molecular weight of the macromolecule in solution provided its conformation is known. The Mark -Houwink -Kuhn -Sakurada (MHKS) relation (Harding et al., 1991 ; 48 Harding, 1997 ) can be used to determine this hydrodynamic parameter. The MHKS equation is as foll ows: []= (2.13) where, [] is the intrinsic viscosity, M is the molecular weight, and a and k are the MHKS exponent and constant, respectively. The MHKS exponent indicates the conformation of a polysaccharide in solution. Values of 'a' equal to 0, 0.5 0.8, and 1.8 indicate a polymer shape of a sphere, random coil, and rigid rod, respectively (Harding and Tombs, 1998 ). A viscometer is the device used to measure viscosity of any given solution (Figure 2.3). Capillary viscometry is based upon the time for a nite volume of liquid to flow through a narrow bore tube under a given pressure. The Ostwald viscometer is the simplest type of capillary viscometer used in this study . 49 Figure 2.3: Schematic presentation of an Ostwald Viscometer. This viscometer is suspended in a temperature controlled water bath. The temperature was kept constant throughout by using a coolant system (Van Holde, 1985 ) Poiseuille's law can be used to calculate the viscosity of the liquid passing through the capillary under the pressure P (Pfitzner, 1976 ), dV dt=a4P 8l (2.14) Where dV/dt is the rate of the volume flow in time t, a and l are the radius and length of the capillary, respectively, and is the viscosity of the liquid. The pressure P is the hydrostatic pressure required for the flow of the liquid. This pressure, th erefore, is the product of height (h), density () and gravity (g). The liquid drop is calculated between two points in the column therefore there is a difference in height 1 (h 1) and height 2 (h 2) during the experiment. 50 Rearranging and integration of the above equation will give the following relationship: t= 8l/ga4dV hh2 h1 (2.15) For a viscometer in which a, l, h and V are xed, equation (2.10) reduces to s/0=(ts/t0).s/0 (2.16) Where, t and are the flow time and density of sample (subscript \"s\") and solvent (subscript \"o\"). At very low concentration the density of solvent and sample are considered as 1 therefore, the difference in the time for the flow of the sample solution to solvent can be used to calculate the viscosity (Van Holde, 19 85). 51 2.2. Analytical ultracentrifugation Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) is a well -established and arguably the most reliable technique for the analysis of biophysical properties like size and overall conformation of biomaterial in solution. These properties can be important with respect to macromolecular applications in industry (Lebowitz, 2002 ; Morris et al., 2014 ; Harding, 2005a ). AUC provides information about sample purity, homogeneity/ heterogeneity, self - association and stability of solution. This method can successfully pr ovide information about the whole range of size distributions for populations of the macromolecular species. It is an absolute and precise method for characterization of solution molecular weight as there are no interactions with matrices or unknown change s in the solution concentration. Furthermore, extensive description of macromolecular solution behaviour can be obtained by the use of a wide range of sample concentration, pH, temperature and co -solutes (Schuck, 2000 ). An analytical ultracentrifuge uses very high rotor speeds (up to 60,000 rpm) to fractionate and analyse the sample based on mass, shape and density. If a macromolecule has a density less than that of the solvent it will float. After a period of time under the influence of a centrifugal field a sample solution in the sector shaped cell starts moving towards the bottom of the cell and a concentration distribution is formed across the cell. Any changes observed during this movement of solution are registered by the optical system - either UV/visible 52 absorption (proteins and other macromolecules with an absorbing chromophore) or Raleigh Interference optics (for any macromolecule - including polysaccharide). Hence a conce ntration profile along the radial axis is obtained which can be recorded as a function of time. During this course of action different component within solutions can separate and then be detected by the optic system. During sedimentation velocity, the hyd rated molecules start depleting at the meniscus and accumulate at the cell bottom (Figure 2.4) while in equilibrium sedimentation, the centrifugal force is balanced by diffusion or back flow of molecules (Figure 2.6). Figure 2.4: Schematic presentation of the formation of concentration gradient and movement of sedimentation boundary towards the cell base (Schilling, 2009 ) 53 2.2.1. Instrumentation Following are the major components of an AUC system (Figure 2.5) The ultracentrifuge Rotor Measuring cells Detectors For sedimentation velocity a small amount of sample (maximum 400 \u00b5l) is loaded on one side of the sector shaped cell and the same amount of buffer or dialysate is loaded in the other half. These cells are loaded into a four or eight hole s rotor. In both cases one hole contains a counter balance to facilitate the measurements. The rotors are then loaded in th e Optima XLA/XLI Analytical Ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter Instruments , Beckman, Palo Alto, CA ). The ultracentrifuge is controlled by a computer program (Proteome lab, Beckman, Palo Alto, CA) . This facilitates to set the required parameters (temperature, rotor speed and experimental time etc). The software helps to acquire data and generates \"ip\" or data files for the attached computer for each scan during the run time. These files can easily be uploaded into the appropriate program for analysis to get th e desired parameters, depending on the type of experiment (sedimentation velocity or sedimentation equilibrium) being undertaken. 54 Figure 2.5: The components & basic set up of the AUC (XLI) using an interference optics detector. The insert shows the p rinciple of a Rayleigh interferometer with the interference fringes behind the double slit. Taken from (Ralston, 1993 ). 55 2.2.2. Sedimentation velocity For the calculation of a sedimentation coefficient, sedimentation velocity (SV) experiments were carried out using the analytical ultracentrifuge . SV analy sis is also used to estimate molecular weight and to get an idea of the conformation of the polysaccharide , particularly when used in conjunction with other methods. For this purpose, sample solutions are spun at very high speeds using AUC , usually from 40,000 - 60,000 rpm (the corresponding angular velocities measured in radian per seconds) in a sector shaped cell (Figure 2.6). Figure 2.6 : A sector shaped cell containing the macromolecule solution during sedimentation velocity experiment. The macromolecule is experiencing centrifugal force (F c), force by buoyancy (F b) and frictional force (F f). Solution boundaries radial position at meniscus is (r m) and at base is (r b) (Van Holde, 1985 ) At the same time these biopolymers displace some solution and are pushed in the opposite direction thus giving rise to a buoyancy effect. Frictional force will also 56 come into play. Frictional force and buoyancy will be acting as a counter centrifugal force leading to the redistribution of the molecules. At this point the molecules will start moving with a certain velocity and a region near the meniscus becomes entirely cleared of the solute. This whole region is called the 'moving boundary'. The velocity rate, at which this boundary tra vels towards the bottom of the cell radially, is referred to as the velocity of sedimentation of the biopolymer present in the solution (Van Holde et al., 2006 ; Cole et al., 2008a ) Summarising the theory from those references, the force (F a) on a particle due to the gravitational field is Fa= m2r (2.17) where, m = the mass of the particle, = the rotor speed in radians per second (= 2rpm/60), and r = the distance from the centre of the rotor. The constant velocity \"v\" attained by the particles will be resisted by the frictional force (F b) Fb=m 02r-fv (2.18) where, 57 m0 =the mass of the displaced solution (grams) f= frictional coefficient that is 6r But displaced mass is equal to the product of the mass times its partial specific volume times density m0 = m (2.19) = partial specific volume (ml/g) and = solution density (g/ml) At this point the molecules will start moving with a certain velocity and the total force acting upon it will be zero where the net force is zero is calculated as follows Substituting (2.1 8) in (2.1 9), 2rm (1 -) - fv = 0 (2.20) Rearranging the equation (2.3.4 we get the sedimentation coefficient, (1-)/N v/2r = since m =Molecular weight (M) / Avogadro's number (N A) The unit of sedimentation coefficient is the second, s, of the Svedberg, S, where 1S unit = 1x 10-13 sec. Equation (2.20) explains that the sedimentation velocity is essentially the particle velocity per unit gravitational field. It also shows that sedimentation velocity is directly proportional to t he mass of the particle times its buoyancy and inversely 58 proportional to the frictional coefficient. Thus if the density of the solute particle is more than the buoyancy of this particle will also be high and the particle will sediment. On the other hand, if the density is less than the buoyancy will also be less and particle wi ll float instead of sedimenting (Van Holde et al., 2006 ; Lebowitz, 2002 ; Serdyuk et al., 2007 ; Ralston, 1993 ; Harding et al., 1990a ; Morgan et al., 1990 ). The rate of movement of the solute particles in the given sample solution can be calculated by estimating the rate of movement of the midpoint of the moving boundary \"r b\". Rearranging the equation 2. 21 with respect to the r b, apparent sedimentation can be calculated as follows v=r h2s* = (dr b)/dt (2.22) Integrating on both sides, ln (r b(t)/ rb(t o)) = 2s (t-to) (2.23) Therefore, a plot of ln (r b (t )/ rb (t0)) vs 2t, is expected to give a straight line. The slope of this plot will give the sedimentation coefficient (s) (Rowe et al., 1992 , Van Holde, 1985 ). The \"s\" value thus obtained will be the apparent value which means it is not corrected for diffusion or non ideality (Morris et al., 2001 ). This can be achieved by using sedimentation time derivative method g*(s). T his algorithm monitors the variations in concentration profiles with respect to radial 59 position and time interval. These variations are then used to produce an apparent distribution of sedimentation coefficients in the form of g*(s) versus s T,b. From this , standardi zation to s 20,w values (i.e. taking an ac count of the standard condition for density and viscosity of water at 20oC) can be achieved, according to the following equation. s20,w=sT,b[(1)T,b (120,w)][20,w T,b] (2.24 ) To avoid the effect of non ideality in calculation of sedimentation coefficient (s), a series of concentration (c) can be used to obtain various s values. The extrapolated value to zero concentration of a plot between sedimentation coefficient vs concentration can give so20,w. The so20,w means sedimentation coefficient at zero concentration at 200C under the environmental condition similar to water as a buffer (Ralston, 1993 ; Harding and Johnson, 1985 ). s20,w = s20,w0 (1-ksc) (2.25 ) The Gralen parameter s) can be calculated from the known sedimentation coefficient values. The Gralen parameter is the sedimentation concentration dependent regression coefficient. 'k s' can be obtained by dividing the slope with intercept from the plot between concentration and sedimentation coefficient. Furthermore, if the intrinsic viscosity of the macromolecule is known this informat ion can be used to find out the Wales -van Holde ratio, which is the ratio between Gralen parameter to the intrinsic viscosity (k s/[]). This parameter can be helpful to 60 predict the shape of the macromolecule can be easily predicted. k s/[] ratio for rods ~ 0.2 -0.4 and for random coils and spheres ~1.6 (Harding and Tombs, 1998 ). The translational diffusion coefficient (D) can be calculated by measurement of the rate of the spreading of the boundary for a monodisperse system using AUC. The diffusion coefficient in turn depends upon the size of the particle, according to the Stokes -Einstein relationship (equation 2.2 6) (Van Holde et al., 2006 ) D= RT/ N Af (2.26) However, for the polysaccharide protein complexes and poly saccharides themselves ; systems which can be very polydisperse , it can be difficult to estimate the diffusion coeffic ient with the analytical ultracentrifuge (Harding, 2005a ) Therefore, th e much better suited technique of dynamic light scattering (DLS) was used to calculate diffusion coefficients. Although high angles are permitted for nearly spherical scatters such as oil bodies, this is not the case for the macromolecular components, part icularly the polysaccharides where rotational diffusion can contribute to the DLS autocorrelation calculations - at low angles these effects are small. The sedimentation velocity method can also be employed to estimate molecular weight of the sedimenting species if the diffusion coefficient of the molecule is known using the following relationship, known as the Svedberg equation (Svedberg and Pedersen, 1940 ). s/D = M (1 -) /N Af x N Af/RT (2.27) 61 Rearranging the equation (2.27) gives: s/D = M (1 -)/RT (2.28) where, R = gas constant and T = absolute temperature (in Kelvin, K). The sedimentation coefficient is the function of size, shape and hydration of a biopolymer. For any molecule under investigation, if information about its sedimentation coefficient and molecular weight is available it is possible to estimate its gross shape using another parameter which is \"frictional ratio\" (f/f o ) (Harding, 1995 ). It is the ratio of the frictional coefficient f for a macro molecule to that for a spherical molecule of the same mass and sphere with no hydration f/fo= 1. Any variation in this value means increase in asymmetry and hydration of the molecule (Tanford, 1961 ). The SEDFIT program was employed to analyse the data using least square boundary modelling (ls -g*s) and c(s) (Dam and Schuck, 2004 ). SEDFIT uses all of the sedimenting scans attained during a velocity run to obtain a high -resolution sedimentation coefficient distribution, and is therefore considered to be more suitable for a sample with unknown hydrodynamic parameters . 62 Both algorithms are based on the Lamm equation (equation 2.30 ), which is (2.30) Equation 2. 30 is the partial differential equation that includes the formation of the concentration distribution of macromolecular species (dc/dt) as a function of time (t) and radial position (r) under the influence of sedimentation ( s) and diffusion (D) in the sector -shaped ultracentrifugal sample cell in the presence of centrifugal force (Lebowitz, 2002 ; Schuck, 2000 ). Direct least square boundary modelling (ls -g*s) works by superimposing the sedimentation profile of the sedimenting particle, obtained over a period of time. This method is ideal for large, heterogeneous, low diffusing particles like polysaccharides. The a lgorithm describes the weight fraction of that particular species sedimenting over the period of time (Harding, 2005a ; Schuck and Rossmanith, 2000 ). The c(s) modelling is also based on least squares modelling of the sedimentation boundaries but it takes into account of diffusion and weight average shape factor (f/f0) of sedimenting species (Schuck, 2000 ). 2.2.3 . Sedimentation The sedimentation equilibrium (SE) method using the analytical ultracentrifuge can be employed to determine average molecular weights (principally the weight 63 average) of a sample in solution and an idea about the molecular weigh t distribution and possible interaction parameters The SE method has an advantage over other analytical methods for molecular weight determination (for example, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, size exclusion chromatography) because of its relative simplicity, accuracy and absoluteness. For a distribution, partial fractionation according to molar mass takes place within the AUC cell. It does not require calibration standards or columns that can affect the final calculations of the results and could be a possible source of contamination of the results with the previously used samples being stuck to the columns (Machtle and Borger, 2006 ; Schuck et al., 2014 ). Compared with sedimentation ve locity, generally a smaller amount of sample and lower rotor speed is required to run an equilibrium experiment. Sedimentation equilibrium can be easily established by running the centrifuge until the concentration distribution appears to be invariant wit h time (Lebowitz, 2002 ). That is, at lower rotor speed the centrifugal force produces a gradient of macromolecular concentration acro ss the cell. In the beginning, there are more molecules near the bottom of the cell. Gradually diffusion c ome into play in the opposite direction. Hence, sedimentation is balanced by diffusion , buoyancy and equilibrium is attained when the net movement is zero throughout the solution (Figure 2.7). 64 Figure 2.7: Schematic presentation of sedimentation equilibrium. At equilibrium, the resulting concentration distribution is exponential with the square of the radial position (Ralston, 1993 ). At equilibrium, the concentration distribution of the macromolecular solution present between meniscus and cell base, is exponential with the square of the radial position. The gravitational or centrifugal field is pointed along the radial axis. At any point on this axis the gravitational field is equal to 2r (Laue and Sta fford 1999). For monodisperse ideal solutes at equilibrium, when net movement of the molecules in a solution is zero molecular weight can be calculated by the following equation M = 2RT/ (1 - v ) 2 d(lnc)/dr2 (2.31 ) molecular weight volume , = solvent density , = rotor angular velocity, R= gas constant and T = absolute temperature 65 The apparent molecular weight Mw,app can be obtained by from the slope of natural logarithm of concentration versus the square of the radial position. For a polydisperse system instead of straight line a curve is obtained. For such a system, apparent weight average molecular weight Mw,app can be obtained from the average slope of this plot: this can be difficult if there is strong curvature and the cell base is not well defined . If the curve is going upward (positive) it means system is highly polydisperse with self -association while a downward curve indicates non -ideality. To obtain accurate measurement M w,app for a polydisperse system the MSTAR algorithm based on the M* function of Creeth and Harding can be used (Creeth and Harding, 1982 ). This has now been incorporated into the SEDFIT suite of algorithms as SEDFIT -MSTAR (Schuck et al., ). MSTAR is a helpful algorithm in estimati ng point average molecular weight as a function of radial position M w,app (r) and molecular weight of the whole distribution M w,app (Creeth and Harding, 1982 ). Point average molecular weight for a single, ideal non -associating macromolecule, can be obtained by considering the equilibrium distribution an exponential function of the buoyant mass of the macromolecule, ) 1(v M , at a single radial position (equation 2.3 2) , =1 ln( ()0) 2 (2.32) where, c(r) = the concentration signal at radial position r, 66 co = the concentration signal at a reference radial position ro k= RTv 2) 1(2 (2.33 ) R and T are the gas constant and absolute temperature, respectively (Cole et al., 2008b ). For a polydisperse and heterogeneous system like that of the polysaccharide usually a strong curvature is obtained and sample concentration the cell base and meniscus is therefore missed. Therefore, Molecular weight thus calculated will not truly represent the overall sample concentration and could be overestimated. To avoid such problems the M* function (equation 2.33) of (Creeth and Harding, 1982 ) can be used. M* is based on operational point average molecular weight (that is M* take into account of the point average molecular weight of the entire distribution). The M* function can be defined as M(r)= c(r) cm rm2)+2k where, r= radial position M*(r)= molecular weight at the specific radial position , c(r) = concentration of solute at radial position r , cm= concentration of the solute at meniscus 67 2.2.4. Polydispersity index The molecular weight (molar mass) of a polysaccharide is measured as an average molecular weight. This is because of natural variation in chain length of polysaccharides because of the nature of enzyme synthesis (& unlike proteins, without an RNA template). While calculating t he molecular weight of such heteropolymer s, an account of structural variation should be considered. Hence, the system of calculating average molecular weight of the species has been developed . Thus, there are number (M n), weight (M w) and z (Mz) average molecular weight s. The polydispersity index can be calculated to find out a measure of spread in a molecular weight distribution by using the ratios either of Mz/Mw or M w/Mn. Number average molecular weight (M n) is representative of colligative properties (like vapor pressure lowering, freezing point depression, osmotic pressure etc) of the molecule and depend s on the number of molecules and not on their size. Mn = N iMi/ N i (2.35) where, N i represents the molar concentration (mol/ml). The weight average molecular weight depends on size (mass/volume) as well as number of molecules. Mw = c iMi /c i = N iMi2/N iMi (2.36) where, c i = the weight concentration (g/ml) = N iMi The z -average molecular weight is defined by 68 Mz= N iMi3/ N iMi2 (2.37 ) There are number of factors that can influence the equilibrium experiment and the time required to attain equilibrium. Conf ormation, shape and ma ss of the particle, buffer viscosity and choice of the column height can influence the outcome of an experiment. The experimental time is directly proportional to the square of the column height. To correct for optical artefacts. The difference between the initial scans (before any sedimentation redistribution has taken place ) is subtracted from the final equilibrium scan (Harding and Tombs, 1998 ; Machtle and Borger, 2006 ). 69 2.3. Dynamic Light scattering (DLS) Dynamic light scattering (DLS) also termed as quasi elastic light scattering (QLS) or photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) is a non -invasive method to measure size of the particles in a solution. This method allows to measure particles in the range from 1 nanometr e to 1 micrometre , approximately . Dynamic light scattering measures the time dependent intensity fluctuations of the scattered light. This fluctuation is then used to calculate the size of the suspended particles using the Stokes Einstein equati on (Serdyuk et al., 2007 , = viscosity of the solvent (Poise) Particles in solution are in Brownian motion. When laser light strikes these moving particles, the light is scattered with certain intensity (Van Holde et al., 2006 ). This intensity will fluctuate (rapidly) with time due to the motions of the particles. Thus, if it has intensity I(t) at one point, then at time (t+) the intensity will be I(t+). Thus, g (2)()=<().(+)> <>2 (2.39) 70 where, g 2)() is called as \"auto correlation function\" which effectively compares or correlates the intensity scattered at different (very small) time intervals For larger time interval all correlation will have been lost and the value g (2) () will reach unity or g(2)() will decay with . The diffusion coefficient can be calculated from the slope of a plot of between correlation function and delay time using the following relation (Van H olde et al., 2006 ; Tuinier, 1998 ; Harding 1990b ). ln[g (2)()1]= ln c 2h2D (2.40) where, = 2), = scattering angle, n = refractive index, c= concentration (g/ml) 2.3.1. Instrumentation Dynamic Light Scattering allows measurement of the particle down to a few nm in diameter. It can be helpful in sizing the particles of various types of solution which include emulsions, micelles, polymers, proteins, nanoparticles or colloids. A typical DLS system compr ises of the following main components. See for example (Alexander and Dalgleish, 2006 ). (Figure 2.8) 1. Laser: A source of photon beam of light 2. Cell 71 3. Detector: To detect the intensity of the scattered light, detectors are placed at certain angle. For this study we used detection at 173.0o (\"back scatter\") and A schematic set -up of DLS operation. Adapted from (Alexander and Dalgleish, 2006 ) During this study the DLS method was used to identify the diffusion coefficient, particle size distribution and zeta potential of the polysaccharide and oil bodies from the cucurbit family. 72 2.3.2. Diffusion coefficient correction To monitor for non -ideality effects (which can obscure the results) the diffusion coefficient was measured for a series of concentration s and was extrapolated to zero concentration to obtain D 20,w. ck D DDo w 1,20 (2.41) where, D020,w is the translation diffusion coefficient at zero concentration, D 20,w is the value at concentration, c (g mL-1) and k D (mL g-1) is the concentration dependency (Harding and Johnson, 1985 ). All measure ments were carried out at two angle s, being 1730 which takes into account of rotational and translational diffusion whilst at 12.80 contributions from rotational diffusion and anisotropic effects are minimum (Buchard , 1992 ). Diffusion coefficient was calculated for a range of concentration for each sample of polysaccharide in 0.1M PBS, pH 7.0. All samples were filtered using 0.45\u00b5m filter. 2.3.3. Zeta potential The zeta ( potential is the measurement of the strength of the electrochemical equilibrium on boundaries of the particles suspended in a solution, and depends on the charge on a particle as well as other factors. It provides deep understanding of mechanism of dispersion and stability of colloidal system (Salgn et al., 2012 ). 73 Knowledge of potential can be useful to optimize the formulation of suspensions and emulsions. On an industrial scale this information could be useful to predict the long term stability of the product and reduce the time of trial formulations. Each particle in a solut ion is surrounded by a solvent layer. Charge present on the particle surface dictates the nature of surrounding counter ions. The liquid layer surrounding the particle has two parts: 1. The inner Stern layer 2. The diffused layer . The inner Stern layer is the one where the ions are strongly bound while in diffused layer there is a theoretical boundary where the ions and particles make a stable entity (Figure 2.9). When the particle moves the charge with in this boundary moves with it. Charge present outside this boundary does not get affected by the particle movement. potential is therefore, the measurement of the charge present on the surface of this surrounding liquid boundary (Shaw and Costello, 1993 ). 74 Figure 2.9: Illustration for the division of the outer surface of the particle suspended in the liquid under the influence of the electric field to measure zeta potential on the outer surface (Malvern, 2009 ) The nature of the solute and solvent both contribute towards the measurement of potential. Suspended molecules are always in Brownian motion. The stability of any suspension depends upon the attractive and repulsive forces among these particles. It is helpful to determine interaction energy among the particles which can affect the f low behaviour of the particles. A higher potential means higher electrostatic repulsion which in turns means less aggregation or creaming and highly stable colloidal system (Hunter, 1981 ). The potential is measured by calculating the electrophoretic mobility and then applying the Henry equation : UE= 2f(ka)/3 (2.42) 75 UE = electrophoretic = viscosity , f(ka)= Henry's function The potential helps to measure the stability of the colloids at the given ionic strength. The pH plays very important role in stability of colloids and hence in the control of potential. At acidic pH potential is usually positive and vice versa for basic pH. It is recommended that for colloidal system to be stable should have > +30mV or > -30 mV. Very low or high ZP avoids flocculation (Kirby and Hasselbrink Jr, 2004 ; Labib and Williams, 1984 ). The functional groups present on the surface of the molecule can dissociate or can get adso rbed to the ions present in the surrounding solution. The potential is influenced by the biochemical nature of the surrounding aqueous solution. This involves the concentration, type of salt and fundamentally by the pH (Salgn et al., 2006 ; Malhotra and Coupland, 2004 ). Increasing salt concentration is inversely proportional to potential. At very high salt concentration the electrostatic potential decays exponentially and the double layer around the particle collapses and charge repulsion is overcome by van der - Waals forces. This leads to an unstable colloidal suspension (Everett, 1988 ). 2.3.4. DLS and solution clarity DLS is a n easy, simple, relatively fast, inexpensive and non -invasive method f or the characterization of solution properties of biopolymers. However, with turbid or 76 concentrated samples its usefulness is limited and there is a need of dilute and clear solution. This avoids multiple scattering of photons before they reach detector an d helps in accurate measurement. Risk of dust contamination can be avoided with the use of autoclaved dust free cuvets and filtered suspension of sample to reduce the chances of error during experiment (Harding et al., 1990b ) 2.4. Densi tometry Calculation of hydrodynamic parameters, Molecular weight and Diffusion coefficient, using analytical ultracentrifuge is based on Svedberg equation (equation 2.2.7). In order to get the correct calculations for other variable s in the equation, it is essential to precisely determine the buoyancy factor (1- v) which in fact is based on precise determination of partial specific volume ( v ). The experimental values of sedimentation coefficient and molecular weight need to be corrected for the standard conditions and v is required for that correction. Partial specific volume is the increase in the volume of a solution when 1 gram of solute is added to that solution. The partial specific volume is based on the density of the solution and solvent (Van Holde et al., 2006 ) and can be measured using the following equation v = 1 o(1o c) =1d dc o (2.43) 77 where, o = density of the solvent (g/ml) , o = density of the solution (g/ml) . 78 ultracentrifugation The density gradient centrifugation involves separation or fractionation of the substances in a mixture based on their density. The separation is based on the chemical structure expressed in a different solute. The fractionation is based on sample density sedimentation properties and osmotic pressure of the suspending medium (Brakke, 1951 ). The density gradient is created by using a high density salt mixture such as cesium chloride or an organic substance for example sucrose solution. Under the influence of the centrifugal force the s alt molecules will start sedimenting according to their density. With the course of time the molecules will redistribute themselves based on their density and throughout the centrifuge tubes the gradient of salt particles will form. If a heterogeneous solution mixture is placed in this density gradient, the particles within the sample solution will separate according to their unique density. Thus at the end of the experiment, separate bands or zones of sample solution suspended in the density gradient medium are obtaine d. These fractions can be collected by graded slicing of the tube or by using hypodermic needles The range of density that can be covered by this method is 0.8 -2.0 g/ml (Machtle and Borger, 2006 ; Van Holde, 1985 ). 79 Chapter 3: Isolation, extraction and characterization of polysaccharides from Cucurbita moschata (Butternut Squash) 3.1 Introduction The C. moschata grows in a warm and tropical climate . Its fruit, young shoots and flowers are consumed as food. It is used as a vege table in food preparation as well as an ingredient in culinary preparations. (Noelia et al., 2011 ; Doymaz, 2007 ). The fruit is highly polymorphic in terms of size, shape (for example; round, oblong), skin (rough, smooth), and colour (dark to light green). Seeds of this fruit also have a variety of shapes (oblate -elliptic) and colour (yellow to white) (Jacobo -Valenzuela et al., 2011a ). The squash of C. moschata is considered as a plant with multiple health benefits . Hypogly caemia and hypolipidemia inducing effect are the most studied medicinal effects that have been reported in literature (Noelia et al., 2011 ). This study includes extraction and characterization of protein bound polysaccharides (PBPS) and isolation of purified polysaccharides from cucurbits. Protein -bound polysaccharides (PBPS) are composed of a central protein core surrounded by polysaccharide chains (Silva et al., 2011 ). 80 3.2 Methodology 3.2.1 Extraction of polysaccharide -protein complex For the extraction of protein bound polysaccharide the methodology of (Li et al., 2005 ) was followed. Cucurbits ( Butternut squash, Pumpkin and Zucchini) from the local market w ere washed, peeled and deseeded. The fruit pulp was chopped into 10cm3 pieces approximately and dried at 600C for 4 days using a Corsair drier (Nottingham, UK). The powder was made from dried fruit pieces using a Kenwood Blender (Model BL 650). The powdered butternut squash pulp was dispersed in deionized water (1g / 20 ml), centrifuged at 4800rpm for 25 min at 200C using using a Beckman centrifuge Model J2 -21M. The supernatant was collected and was concentrated in a water bath at 450C until the volume reduced to one fift h of the original volume. The concent rate was filtered using Whatman filter paper. The filtrate was washed twice with chilled 95% and absolute ethanol respectively (Swennen et al., 2005 ). Each washing was followed by centrifugation at 4800 rpm at 40C for 25 min. The pellet was collected and freeze dried. The freeze dried pellet was dispersed in distilled water (1mg/ 20ml) and dialyzed against deionized water using dialysis membrane (BioDesignDialysis tubing D106, Fisher Scientific, UL ) with for Cesium chloride (CsCl) density gradient ultracentrifugation An assay for detection of protein polysaccharide complex was performed using CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation (Cortadas et al., 1977 , Carlstedt et al., 1983 ). A CsCl density gradient was formed by dissolving 37 gram CsCl in stock (280mg/ml in water) until the density reached 1.4 g/L. Centrifugation was performed using Beckman preparative ultracentrifuge with rotor 70Ti at a speed of 48000 rpm for 65 hours at (10.0\u00b10.1) 0C. At the end of the centrifugation, 1 ml aliquots were fraction ated from the centrifug al tubes. 3.2.1.2 Isolation of polysaccharide from proteins Sevage reagent was used to remove proteins from the polysaccharides (Li, 2012 ). Sevage reagent was prepared by mixing butanol with chlorofor m in the ratio 5:1. The dialysate was mixed and washed three times with Sevage reagent. The washed sample was later mixed with absolute ethanol followed by centrifugation at 4800 rpm at 4oC for 25 min. The pellet was collected and freeze dried for 48 hours . 3.2.1.3 Dubois Assay (Phenol sulphuric acid test for total sugar) The Dubois assay is a calorimetric assay for determination of sugars using phenol sulphuric acid (DuBois et al., 1956 ; Neilsen, 2003 ). A concentration series of standard solutions of glucose was prepared with each solution of ( 200, 400, 600, 82 800) \u00b5g/ml by dissolving glucose in water. 4.0 mg/ml of polysaccharide solution was prepared from each cucurbit (Butternut squash, Pumpkin and Zucchini) in 0.1 M PBS pH 7.0. Concentrated sulphuric acid (2.5 ml) and 2.5% phenol (1.5 ml) were added to standard glucose and polysaccharide samples. 0.2 ml of standard and sample was added onto the wells of the microplate. Samples were read at a wavelength of 415nm using a BIORAD plate reader which employed Micro plate Manager Software. A standard cu rve was prepared for glucose following the procedure of Neislen (Neilsen, 2003 ). 3.2.1.4 Total sugar test and Uronic acid detection A stock solution of 3% boric acid (w/v) and 2% sodium chloride (w/v) was prepared in water. 100 ml of standard stock solution was prepared by mixing 2% sodium chloride (w/v) and 3% boric acid (w/v) in water. A concentration series for standard solution was prepared using water as a diluent to achieve 0, 25, 50, 75, 100 and 125 \u00b5g/ml of stock solution. 70% (v/v) concentrated sulphuric acid was added to these dilutions. Samples were prepared by mixing a standard solution with polysaccharide solution (1mg/ml) in the ratio 1:1 (v/v). 70% (v/v) of sulphuric acid was added to these samples. Polysaccharide sample solution and standard solutions were incubated in a water bath at 70.00C for 40 minutes. 0.1 ml of dimethyl phenol was added to all of tubes (standard and samples). This was followed by analysis by spectrophotometry (Neilsen, 2003 ). 83 3.2.1.5 Biuret test and Spectrophotometry A Biuret test was performed by measuring the absorbance of dilutions of biur et reagent in distilled water (Janairo et al., 2011 ; Neilsen, 2003 ). Pre -sevage freeze dried sample s (PP) w ere dissolved in water and PBS , respectively. The sample was prepared by mixing 2ml biuret reagent with 1ml pre -sevage samples dissolved in 0.1M PBS, pH 7.0 and water. Serial dilution s were performed with a starting concentration of 5mg/ml until the concentration reached 0.6 mg/ml for the last dilution. The absorbance was recorded between wavelengths of 200nm to 800nm using a Beckman DU 640 spectrophotometer. The Biuret reagent absorbs visib le light at 540 nm , therefore , this wavelength was chosen for the analysis. 3.2.2 Gel Chromatography Sephacryl 400 column ( 2.1 x 50cm) was prepared using 0.1M sodium acetate, 0.02M EDTA pH 6.5. buffer. Flow rate was adjusted to 0.7ml/min. (The pre -packed column (Sephacryl 400 ) was also used before but it did not allow the polysaccharide solutionto pass through and the column was blocked ). The choice of the column was made based on the available literature (Seymour and Harding, 1987 ) 50mg/ml of each polysaccharide was loaded onto the column and 2,5 ml of fractions were collected Eluent was tested for the presence of polysaccharide using the phenol sulphuric acid assay. Fractions rich in polysaccharide were selected for further analysis. 84 3.2.2.1 The P henol Sulphuric Acid Test: To 50 \u00b5l of each fraction, 50 \u00b5l of phenol and 50 \u00b5l of sulphuric acid were added. 20 \u00b5l of this mix was added to the titration plate. Absorbance for each fraction was determined using Bio -Rad iMark TM micro plate reader at 525nm. The same procedure was repeated using Dextran as a standard (Dextran71.4 and 40kDa was used) for this purpose. 3.2.2.2 Dialysis Dialysis tubes (Spectra, MWCO: 3500) were washed with tap water followed by boiling in 0.5M NaOH solution. This allows destruction of cellulose present in the dialysis tubes. Existence of cellulose may interfere in getting the accurate results. Dialysis w as performed on all fractions of polysaccharides for 18 hrs using deionized in 3 liters of distilled water. The water was changed after every 6 hrs. 3.2.2.3 Freeze Drying All polysaccharide fractions were concentrated using rotary evapor ator (IKARV10 Basi rotavapor) at 40 0C and 195 rpm followed by freezing of the sample in a methanol bed. The flask was constantly rotated during this process. Freeze drying was performed using Christ ALPHA 14 freeze drier for 18 hours. 85 3.2.2.4 Starch Test Each fraction was tested for the presence of starch by adding 1 drop iodine to 1 mg of polysaccharide. Any solution containing starch should turn blue. All samples were found as being starch free. 3.2.3 Densi tometry Solution densities were measured using an Anton Parr DMA 5000 density meter. 1ml of each sample was injecte d to evaluate the density at 20 0C after calibration with deionised distilled water (Kratky et Sedimentation velocity A Beckman Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge was used to perform sedimentation velocity experiments. The stock solution was prepared by dissolving 100mg of freeze dried powder in 6 ml of water and PBS followed by dialysis. Sample concentration was measured using a ref ractometer , ATAGO DD5 (ATAGO, UK) and performed in serial dilutions. Matching amounts of buffer was added in the buffer chamber. The loading amount of sample and buffer solutions was 400\u00b5l. Solutions were centrifuged at 40,000rpm at a temperature of 20.0\u00b1 0.1 0C for 12 hrs. Data was analyzed using the g(s) and c(s) methods in SEDFIT software (Dam and Schuck, 2004 ). The PBPS complex and polysacchari de were analysed using water and phosphate buffer saline (PBS), 0.1M ionic strength and pH 7.0 as solvent and buffer, respectively. Fractionated purified polysaccharide was analysed in buffer alone. 86 Beckman Optima XL -I an alytical ultracentrifuge was used to perform sedimentation equilibrium experiments. Samples were prepared in the same way as mentioned in the sedimentation velocity section above in 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.0. The loading amount of sample and buffer solutions was 80\u00b5l. Solutions were centrifuged at 10,000rpm at a temperature of 20.0 \u00b10.1 0C for 72 hrs. Data acquired from the experiment was analysed using the SEDFIT - MSTAR program (Schuck et al., 2014 ) 3.2.6 Intrinsic Viscosity Viscosity of all samples in solution was measured using an Ostwald viscometer. All sample solutions were prepared in 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.0. A concentration range of 0.2-2.0mg/m l was used. The flow times were recorded at 20.0\u00b10.01\u00b0C. From the solution/solvent flow-time ratio the kinematic relative viscosity was obtained. Because of the low sample concentrations a correction for density to dynamic relative viscosities was deemed unnecessary (see Harding, 1997). The intrinsic viscosity was found by extrapolatio n to infinite dilution of the reduced viscosities using the Huggins equation (Harding, 1997 ). 3.2.7 Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) Freeze dried polysaccharide sample s were dissolved 0.1 M PBS. Starting from 8 mg/ml, further dilutions were made in the respective buffers until the concentration reached 0.25 mg/ml. Samples were analysed for size distribution analysis using a 87 Malvern Instruments Zetasizer NanoZS (Malvern Instruments, UK) with Zetasizer Software v6.0 . A low scattering angle of 13o was chosen to minimize complications due to rotational diffusion effects (Buchard, 1992 ). To calculate the translational diffusion coefficient, the radius obtained from peak values is substituted in the Stokes -Einstein equation (equation 2. 37). A detailed description of the DLS method is given in Chapter 2, section 2.3. 88 3.3 Results and Discussion For C. moschata, the protein polysaccharide complex was the first macromolecule obtained after extraction wh ich was further purified to remove protein and fractionated into three separate fractions (NJBTF1, 2 and 3) in order to characterize and gain structural insight to the polysaccharide. 3.3.1 Conformation assays for the assay for the presence of protein polysaccharide complex Three prominent bands were obtained as a result of cesium chloride density equilibrium separation of the unfractionated complex. Absorbance at 280 nm was used to monitor the protein component in the separated fractions . Figure 3.1 depicts a centrifuge tube with 3 different components with respective density bands . 89 Figure 3.1: A schematic presentation of the centrifuge tube with different density bands obtained after cesium chloride density gradient experiment. Based on the density calculated for each band, the top band is for proteins, middle one is for the protein polysaccharide complex and the bottom one is for the polysaccharide. For proteins the isopycnic density should be ~ 1.3 g/ml, for polysaccharides it should be between 1.6 -2.0 g/ml and any glycoprotein complex in between the two of them (Beeley, 1985 ). Therefore, the top band (up to fraction 9) is for proteins, middle one s for the glycoprotein complex (fraction number 10 -16) and lower one for the 90 polysaccharides (fraction 17 onwards) (Figure 3. 2). 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 240.00.20.40.60.81.01.21.41.61.8 Density (g/ ml)Absorbance (280nm) 3. 2: Absorbance (280nm) (in black) and density (in red) plot against fraction number obtained through Cesium chloride density gradient. Intriguingly, significant absorption levels were seen not only for the fractions at a density of 1.3 g/ml, but for the higher density fractions (from fraction 9 -15) of density 1.5-1.6 mg/ml: this might be possibly due to pigmentation of the polysaccharide rather than the presence of significant amounts of bound proteins which would lower the density. 91 3.3.1.2 Total sugar test and uronic acid detection After extraction the freeze dried powder was tested for the presence of polysaccharide and specifically uronic acid. A standard curve was plotted for concentration of sample/ standard agai nst absorbance. Figure 3. 3 indicates the positive result for the presence of polysaccharides and uronic acid in all three cucurbit samples. 200 400 600 800 10000.000.050.100.150.200.25 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 1400.000.250.500.751.00Total sugar test Glucose standard Butternut squash Absorbance at 490 nm Concentration g/mlA B standard Difference of Absorbance 450-400 nm Concentration g/ml Figure 3. 3: (A) Standard curve to confirm presence of polysaccharide in the freeze dried material obtained at the end of extraction from C.moschata (Butternut squash), (B) Standard curve to confirm the presence of Uronic acid in the extracted polysaccharide samples fro m C.moschata (Butternut squash) . of After extractions, all polysaccharides were fractionated through gel chromatography (details in Section 3.2.2). The eluted fractions were tested for the presence of polysaccharide using the phenol sulphuric acid test (see Section 3.2.2.1). The elution prof ile presented 3 distinguishing peaks. Based on this profile the cut off point for each fraction was decided as given in Figure 3. 4 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 240 260 280012345 Fraction3 Fraction 2 Fraction 1Absorbance (525nm) Volume (ml) Figure 3. 4: Elution profile of C. moschata from Gel chromatography column. Absorbance was measured at 525nm. 93 3.3.2 Analytical Ultracentrifugation Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) was performed to determine the sedimentation coefficient distributions and molecular weight for the biopolymer of interest. In addition to these two parameters, information from the AUC can provide an insight into the structural (conformational) changes taking place in the macromolecule. This method is robust and useful because AUC provides an absolute measurement of the parameters with no prior requirement of standard or calibration. 3.3.2.1 Sedimentation velocity: Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed on protein polysaccharide complex, purified polysaccharides and further fractionated polysaccharides from C. moscahta . The aim was to get information about the homogeneity/heterogeneity and sedimentation coefficient distributions. 3.3.2.1.1 Protein bound polysaccharides (PBPS) - unfractionated material During extraction of polysaccharide from butternut squash, protein bound polysaccharide complex was the first molecule during the extraction procedure. To observe the behaviour of the extracted macromolecule in an environment more close to the natural physiological envi ronment analysis was carried out using deionized water as a buffer and PBS 0.1M at pH 7.0 . Sedimentation velocity profile s for protein bound polysaccharides thus obtained , are shown in Figure 3. 5. 94 0 2 4 6 8 100.00.10.20.30.40.50.60.7 0 2 4 6 8 100.00.51.01.52.02.5 The coefficient ls -g*(s) for glycoprotein complex in deionized water, pH= 7.0 (above) and in 0.1M PBS (pH7.0) at different loading concentrations (below) The sedimentation coefficient distribution obtained through ls -g*(s) analysis for the PBPS complex indicated that the sample is heterogeneous and highly polydisperse. The broad peaks with a shoulder on one side of the distribution indicated the presence of more than one species in the sample preparations. The presence of discrete sedime ntation boundaries helped to identify different species present in the 95 sample. In water, however there was no significant shift of the sedimentation boundary with changing concentration in contrast to PBS. The results for ls -g*s are in agreement with the analyses performed using the alternative c(s) algorithm which attempts to reduce the effects of diffusive broadening of the peaks leading to better resolution (Dam and Schuck, 2004 ). The c(s) profiles show multiple species were sedimenting at the same point where g(s) distribution gave one broad distribution peak (Figure 3. 6). This shows the greater resolving power of the c(s) method. Heterogeneity and polydispersity are the consistent characteristics of polysaccharides where presence of more than one species and asymmetrical peaks is a norm (Harding, 2005c ). Values of the weight average S 20,w were also obtained for ea ch peak from the SEDFIT software (Dam and Schuck, 2004 ). 96 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 80.00.20.40.60.81.01.2g(s)/ c(s) ls-g*s c(s) of polysaccharide protein complex to show sample heterogeneity that can be seen with multiple peaks in c(s) profile (in red) superimposed by broad ls -g*s distribution (in black). From plotting the weight average sedimentation coefficient S 20,w of the peaks, against concentration, an so20,w can be obtained.

Unresolved peaks lead to the calculation for the unfractionated PBPS complex, s020, w in wate r to be (2.3 \u00b10.1) x 10-13 sec. In contrast to water, it was possible to get defined peaks using PBS and to identify presence of 3 prominent species in the sample. 98 The s020, w values thus obtained are given in (Table 3. 1). This is probably due to the shielding effect of salts present in PBS that would have covered any exposed charged ion present on the surface of the PBPS complex. Table 3. 1: Calculation of sedimentation coefficient ( s20,w) and weight percentage of respective species detected in C. moschata complex in 0.1 M PBS, pH7.0 using interference optics For the complex, the apparent s value decreased from 2.03 to 1.60S over the concentration range 0.1 to 12 mg/ml which is a typical characteristic of non - associating molecules (Machtle and Borger, 2006 ).

It can be observed that interference and abso rption peaks lie almost at the same position on the scale except that the absorbance optics peaks are shorter as compare to the interference optics peaks. This could be due to the fact the proteins and polysaccharide were present as a compact structure and sedimented together hence the similar sedimentation behaviour . 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 5.5 6.00.00.51.01.52.02.5c(s) sedimentation coefficient (S) Interefence optics Absorbance optics Figure 3. 8: c(s) profiles recorded using interference optics (black trace) and uv - absorption optic at 280nm (red trace) for the protein polysaccharide complex .

After Sevage treatment (Li, 2012 ) purified polysaccharides were further analysed by sedimentation velocity. Deionized water and 0.1M PBS, pH 7.0 were used as solvents. Figure 3. 10 presents sedimentation distribution profile of butternut squash polysaccharide in the respective solvent.

The 2nd species showed upward trend in the s vs c data in plot B. This may be due to noise in the dat a or a possible self -association. It is evident from Figure 3.10A and B that there are 3 prominent species present in the sample. These species were constantly present at all concentrations and at the same weight percentage. In water, the sedimentation co efficient decreased with and increasing concentration however, the situation was slightly different with one of the species (Specie s 2) using PBS as a buffer. Here, sedimentation increased with an increasing concentration indicating possible association am ong polysaccharide. 104 Table 3. 3: Calculation of sedimentation coefficient ( s20,w) and weight percentage of respective species detected in C. moschata purified polysaccharide in 0.1 M PBS, pH7.0 Although there was not too much difference in the weight average sedimentation coefficients for the polysaccharide dissolved in water and PBS, 0.1 M PBS was considered as the choice of solvent for further experimentation because of charge shielding and buf fering provided. This will allow us to have more clear data. To further investigate the solution properties of these species, the three fractions of C. moschata were then considered. 3.3.2.1.3 Fractionated polysaccharides To further investigate the stru cture the from C. moschata was further fractionated. Fractions of polysaccharide were obtained using gel chromatography as mentioned in section 3.2.2 .

Overall polydispersity and heterogeneity was still observed in all three samples. However, when compared to the unfractionated molecule a reduction was ob served in the broadening of the peaks obtained from the fractionated polysaccharides which mean a significant reduction in the polydispersity. Nevertheless, two species were more prominent in all samples. It was also observed that there was unsurprisingly a general decrease in sedimentation coefficient with decrease in molecular weight of the polysaccharide (Figure 3.1 2) 106 0 1 2 3 4 50.00.20.40.60.81.0 0 1 2 3 4 50.00.20.40.60.81.0 0 1 2 3 4 50.00.20.40.60.81.00 1 2 3 normalized ls-g*s and c(s) sedimentation profile obtained at 2mg/ml (a) un purified (B) NJBTF1, (C) NJBTF 2, (D) NJBTF3. 107 NJBTF1 In a sedimentation velocity experiment for NJBTF1, the ls -g*(s) profile indicates a broader distribution at higher concentration indicating the high polydispersity in the sample. The non -ideality reduced as concentrations was lowered. Furthermore, the presence of a small shoulder indicated the presence of more than one species in the sample. To confirm these f indings, a closer observation was made using the better resolving c(s) analysis. Two species sedimenting at 1.2 S with weight percentage of 81% and 3 S with weight percentage 19% were detected by c(s). The second species became undetectable at very low loa ding concentration (Figure 3.13). 108 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.00123456 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.005101520 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.50246810 c(s) Sedimentation 0.5mg/ml Figure 3.1 3 Concentration dependence of the c(s) profiles for fractionated polysaccharide where (A) is fraction 1 (NJBTF1), (B) is fraction 2(NJBTF2) and (C) is fraction 3 (NJBTF3). 109 Table 3. 4: Calculation of sedimentation coefficient ( s20,w) and weight percentage of respective species detected in C. moschata fractionated polysaccharides of C. moschata Sample Peak 1 Peak 2 Peak 3 s20,w(S) Weight % of total material s20,w(S) Weight % of total material s20,w(S) Weight % of total material NJBTF1 1.29 \u00b1 0.03 81 3.58 \u00b1 Species 1 (81%) (19%)1/s (g/ml)NJBTF1 specie (5%) species (2%) C (g/ml) s (S) Species 1 (83%) Species 2 (17%)s (S) C (g/ml)NJBTF3 1/s (S-1) Species 1 (83%) Species 2 (17%) C (g/ml)NJBTF3 Figure 3.1 4: Concentration dependence of the sedimentation and reciprocal sedimentation coefficient for C. moschata polysaccharides fractions in 0.1M PBS, pH 7.0. The plots are illustrating the presence of 2 -3 species in each fraction along with weight% of each species within that fraction . 111 NJBTF2 The NJBTF2 was the second fraction of the butternut squash polysacchar ide. The sedimentation profile for ls -g*s and c(s) analysis was similar to the previous fraction (NJBTF1) containing a broad peak with a shoulder on the right side indicating heterogeneity of the sample. The peak size reduced gradually with reduction in concentration (figure 3.12). However, there was a slight shift in the sedimentation coefficient indicating a structural difference between the last (Fraction 1) and the present fraction (Fraction 2). The presence of the second prominent species was detected in NJBTF2 using the c(s) procedure. The weight percentage of the 1st and 2nd specie was 93% and 5% respectively (Figure 3.13). NJBTF3 Analysis using ls -g*(s) prominently indicated a reduction in heterogeneity in the last polysaccharide fraction. It was also conformed from the c(s) analysis that the most dominating species had a weight percentage of 83%. However, second species traces were also detectable and this was estimated as 17% weight of the total content (Figure 3.1 4). A general decrease in sedi mentation coefficient was observed upon purification and fractionation. It was observed that the polydispersity also decreased upon fractionation of the polysaccharide. This was probably due to the removal of impurities and other species in the sample. The s value obtained upon every stage of extraction and purification can be considered as a representative s value of the major species present at that particular concentration stage. 112 3.3.2.1.4 Analysis of Cucurbita moschata extracted polysac charide using uv -visible absorbance optics. The data obtained from C.moschata during all stages of extraction and fractionation was also analysed using absorbance optics (at a wavelength of 280nm) to find out the presence of protein in the sample. Figure 3.15 includes superimposed graphs for the interference and absorbance optics for the protein polysaccharide complex, unfractionated polysaccharide and fractionated polysaccharides. The complex showed good absorbance due to the presence of protein. Furthe r purification and fractionation resulted in elimination of proteins from the extracted polysaccharide resulting in reduction in absorbance optics signals. However, other than the PBPS complex no proteins peaks were detected in C. moschata polysaccharides (fractionated and unfractionated) using c(s) absorbance absorbance was observed in unfractionated and fractionated material. The possible reason could be the presence of natural pigments in the polysaccharide sample that would have allowed presence of protein in complex is evident from the c(s) absorbance profiles . 113 0 1 2 3 4 5 60.00.51.01.52.02.5 0 1 2 3 4 5 60.00.51.01.52.0 0 1 2 3 4 5 60.00.51.01.52.0 0 1 2 3 4 50123 0 2 4 6 8 100.00.51.01.52.0c(s) sedimentation optics sedimentation coefficient (S) Interference optics Absorbance optics Figure 3.1 5: Superimposed sedimentation profile for interference optics and absorbance optics (at a wavelength of 280nm) obtained at 2mg/ml where (a) complex, (b) un -fractionated purified polysaccharide, (c) 3.3.2.2 Sedimentation Equ ilibrium and Molecular weight determination Molecular weight was determined using the sedimentation equilibrium in the AUC for unfractionated material and NJBTF1, 2 and 3. A series of concentrations was prepared. The SEDFIT -M* algorithm (Schuck et al., 2014 ) was used to calculate the apparent molecular weight for each concentration. MSTAR (M*) function provides radial extrapolation to the cell base to evaluate weight average molecular weight (M w, app). The weight average molecular weights (Mw) were obtained from the intercept of the plot (M w, app vs concentration) at zero concentration to remove the effect of non - ideality. For unfractionated (purified) polysaccharide, the sample hetero geneity made it very difficult to calculate weight average molecular weight (M w) at high concentrations. As non -ideality reduces with reduction of concentration therefore, a very low concentration of sample was selected for apparent molecular weight M w,app estimations and the approximations, and the approximations M w~ M w,app made In this way a value of 82.4kDa was obtained (Figure 3.1 6). . 50.0 50.5 d cMw,app (c) (kDa) Concentration (signal ln (c) r2 (cm2) Figure 3.1 6: SEDFIT -M* data for analysis on unfractionated C. moschata polysaccharide with molecular weight 82400 Da.

The plot represents a linear regression to highlight deviations from linearity arising from polydispersity/ non ideality. The red lin e is the fit As expected, weight average molecular weight of unfractionated polysaccharide lay within the range of the fractionated materials (Table. 3.5). 116 Besides this SEDFIT -M* also provides Information from c(M) approach which is based on the direct modelling of the experimental distribution by least square method and gives low resolution molecular weight (Schuck et al., 2014 ). Table 3.5: Weight average molecular weights obtained for un -fractionated and fractionated C. moschata polysaccharide Figure 3.1 7: Apparent molecular weight (M w app) vs concentration to obtain the non - ideality corrected weight average molecular weight M w from extrapolation (not shown) to c=0. A linear scale; B log scale. As reported in the literature for other polysaccharide see for example (Hokputsa et al., 2003 ; Oldberg et al., 1979 ; Morris et al., 2000 ) the highest molecular weight 118 (NJBTF1) presented a positive slope however; the other two fractions (NJBTF2 & NJBTF3) presented a negative slope (Figure 3.16). This behaviour could be a contribution from the self -association experienced by low molecular weight species in the sample. The only reason that these species did not appear in NJBTF1 could be the presence of higher molecular weight component that dominated these smaller species. To investigate further the possible self - association in the polysaccharide fractions, the algorithm M_INVEQ ( Rowe , unpublished run under pro FitTM, Quansoft, Zurich) was used: to estimate molar association/dissociation constant (K a/ Kd) using the following relationships (equation & , = molar concentration of reacting species , [AB] = molar concentration of product. For a self - association, A and B are the same. The degree of self -association among the lower molecular weight fractions (NJBT F2 & 3) was expressed in terms of the dissociation constant (K d) (Table 3.6). Any value 119 higher than 50\u00b5M (0.05mM) is considered as weak interaction for polysaccharides (Harding, 2005b ) - so the association i s only weak. Table 3.6: Dissociation constant estimates for low molecular weight fractions of C. moschata from M -INVEQ Sample Kd (mM) NJBTF2 0.31 NJBTF3 2.62 No association was seen for fraction NJBTF1 but there seems evidence for weak association in the other fractions. Self-association of biopolymers is an important physiological phenomenon observed during various cellular processes . For example, cell -cell adhesion/ de - adhesion and activation of immune complexes (Patel et al., 2007 ; Yu et al., 2002 ; Song et al., 1998 ; Rudd et al., 2001 ; Hakomori, 2004 ). Self - association is a well - known phenomenon in proteins (Pandit and Rao, 1974 ; Balbo and Schuck, 2005 ). Such type of weak association has also been reported in conjugates for example glycoproteins (Silkows ki et al., 1997 ; van der Merwe et al., 1993 ; Davis et al., 2003 ) and glycolipids (Harris and Siu, 2002 ). 120 3.3.3 Intrinsic Viscosity Intrinsic viscosity of any macromolecule is a function of its hydrodynamic volume and size.

Based on the information obtained through GCMS (Chapter 5), the respective polysaccharide is rich in galactouronic acid and rhamnose is therefore considered as pectin like-sugars. Intrinsic viscosity of pectin reported in literature lies in the 122 range of 80 -1600 ml/g (Morris et al., 2014 ). These values are very close to the one obtained for unfractionated polysaccharide in this study (Table 3. 7). Table 3. 7: Intrinsic viscosity of unfractionated and 34.0 23.0 \u00b1 0.7 As expected the intrinsic viscosity drops with fraction number, since the weight average molecular weights are correspondingly lower, although surprisingly unfractionated materials shows a high molecular weight. These results are in agreement for the pectin obtained from butternut squash in a separate study where the viscosity change was proportional to the variation in molecular weight. These changes were attributed to the difference in extraction method for pectin from the pumpkin (Shkodina et al., 1998 ). 123 3.3.4 Dynamic Light scattering ( for the presence of large particles) Dynamic light scattering was used to calculate the diffusion coefficient and size distribution of the extracted biomaterial (protein polysaccharide complex, unfractionated and fractionated polysaccharides) from C. moschata as described in (Section 2.3.2) . Measurements were performed at both lower (1 30) - to minimize complications of rotational diffusion (see Burchard, 1992) and, for comparison purposes only higher angle (1730) and samples were filtered using 0.45\u00b5m filter. Figures 3.19 and 3.20 include plots of concentration vs diffusion coefficient for each sample calculated at both angle. The D020,w was calculated from the intercept of these plots in order to eliminate the effects of non -ideality in the polysaccharide sample solution. Two prominent species were detected in the protein -polysaccharide complex. The second specie s was did not appear in any other sample at both angles except that large size particles were detected in fraction 2 and 3 at higher angle. Appearance of these two species in the last 2 fractions could be just the misrepresentation of the particles. Variations in the diffusion coefficient from the two angles are due to the anisotropy in the polysaccharide structure. At higher angle there is a contribution from rotational and translational diffusion whilst the lower angle only takes account of translational diffusion. Large particles were found to be particularly difficult to remove - even with filtration and a consequence they dominated the DLS behaviour. These particles would not 124 have been detected in the analytic al ultracentrifuge (any particulates not in solution would have sedimented away rapidly) nor in intrinsic viscosity measurement (unaffected by non -dissolved particles). Nonetheless the DLS gives us complementary information about the large particulates und etected by the other techniques (Table 3. 8). These large particles could possibly have a role in the bioactivity of the sample (Chapter 6). 125 0.00 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.052.0x10-94.0x10-96.0x10-98.0x10-91.0x10-81.2x10-8 0.00 Diffusion coefficient calculated using larger angle (1730) from polysaccharide extracted C. moschata .

First polymer obtained during this process was protein polysaccharide complex (PBPS) , second one was polysaccharide followed by three fractions collected through fractionation of this polysaccharide using Gel chromatography. In order to understand the structural changes occurred during extraction and purification, measurement of hydrodynamic parameters (sedimentation coefficient, molecular weight viscosity and diffusion coefficient) was carried out at each stage of extraction and purification. These structural changes could possibly influence the bioactivity of this polysaccharid e. Presence of protein (in PBPS) and multiple species were detected during sedimentation analysis of complex . This could be due to the fact that the all polysaccharides are hi ghly polydisperse polymers and naturally polysaccharide s can be present as a complex bound with other plant material . In an attempt to isolate polysaccharide, washing with sevage reagent and fractionation using gel chromatography was performed. Although there was a clear reduction in number of observed species after removal of proteins but polydispersity 130 index (PDI) remained high. Possible conformational changes due to protein removal could be the reason of this constant behaviour of PDI . For molecular weight calculation it was important to maintain the lower speed (for example in the range of 6 to 10k rpm) using AUC for a long period of time. For rapidly deteriorating sample like PBPS it was not possible to calculate weight average molecular weight using AUC (experimental time 72 \u00b1 24 hrs) . Same challenge was presented by higher concentrations of highly polydisperse polysaccharide. However, weight average molecular weight was calculated for lowest concentration of isolated polysaccharide and respective fra ctions (fractions obtained through ge l chromatography) from C. moschata . Moreover, t here was an increase in the molecular weight of 1st fraction after fractionation which could possibly be due to the conformational changes occurred due to the removal of the impurities from the sample. The Gralen parameter ( ks) could be used to calculate conformation of the molecule based on the sedimentation velocity results but presence of smaller specie s along with the larger specie slows down the sedimentation process and hence induces non-ideality. This results in very high ks values. Molecular weight obtained during this study for polysaccharide and the 1st two fractions is much higher as reported in literature ( Du et al., 2011; Song et al., 2012) . However, the last fraction molecular weight comes in the range o f the molecular weight calculated by the two studies for C. moschata . The reason behind this could be that in this study gel chromatography is only used for fractionation and structural analysis is purely based on hydrodynamic characterisatio n. Nevertheless, AUC is 131 an absolute method of characterisation where there are no chances of sample dilution on column or interaction with column material whilst the other two studies had characterised the molecules on the column and due to the limitation of the two methods (gel chromatography and High performance liquid chromatography) , could have missed the higher molecular weight components completely. Sedimentation velocity and equilibrium methods collectively helped to predict self -association in the fractionated polysaccharide. It was challenging to identify self -association in the complex and purified polysacc haride due to the presence of a number of species in the sample. Self-association phenomenon is observed by a number of polysaccharides and has been reported in literature (see section (3.3.2.2) but for C. moschata this sort of association is unique . Although only weak self -association was observed , this fraction of polysaccharide can be studied further to exploit its potential in biological applications. Viscosity of protein polysaccharide complex could not be measured because sample was highly uns table and it was not possible to obtain constant viscosity upon repetition of experiment. However, the data obtained after purification and fractionation was constant upon repetition. Also, viscosity and molecular weight of the polysaccharides were directly proportional . Additionally, it was observed that both quantities gradually decrease d starting from isolated polysaccharide to last fraction of polysaccharide which indicates the validity of purification procedures. Calculation of diffusion coefficient was one of the supporting parameters for characterization of the polysaccharide at different stages of purification. Besides being swift and speedy method, the inability of method to de al with highly 132 polydisperse sample limits its usefulness. However, during this work it was possible to detect the large sized particles that were not picked before using sedimentation velocity experiment. Nonetheless, the p resence of multiple species and the requirement of measurement of viscosity for individual species hindered prediction of conformation. Besides all efforts taken to purify the sample it was physically impossible to narrow down to the extraction of one single species. Although polysaccharides from C. moschata has been extracted before as reported in literature but (at the time of writing ) there is no study that has reported to carry out similar analysis. This study includes the establishment of isolation and purification procedures for C. moschata polysaccharide. Furthermore, an analysis of solution structure provides information about the 4 different hydrodynamic parameters of this polysaccharide. Structural variations adapted by this polysaccharide at each s tage of purification and fractionation also predict functional differences. Thus, each fraction represents its own potential to be used as a whole or as a part of any drug if required in future. For future work , use of an alternative technique like SECMALS can help to narrow down viscosity and molecular weight calculation to single species. SECMALS will possibly be helpful in predicting other conformational paramete rs of individual species. Also HYDFIT can be used to obtain i nformation about shape and conformation by combining hydrodynamic data obtained through the current work along with the information obtained through SECMALS. 133 For industrial uses more specifically in biomedical and pharmaceutical application, it is important for a natural extract to be pure homogeneous and to maintain consistency in chemical structure and composition. Polysaccharide can be modified to bring specific behaviour in response to the env ironmental stimuli in which the design, chemistry structure and function are correlated. However, before any modifications the complete understanding of the natural structure is required. The method of extraction determines the degree of preservation of or iginal structure. This is because some changes in the natural structure are unavoidable in order to remove impurities from the complex structures. Conclusively, the results obtained are beneficial in predicting the solution structure of the polysaccharide in various stages of purification and fractionation. This in turn will be helpful in designing and predicting the behaviour of the molecule when implied for therapeutic work using var ious environmental conditions. 134 Chapter 4: Hydrodynamic analysis of polysaccharides from Zucchini (Cucurbita pepo. L ) 4.1 Introduction Cucurbita pepo L. var. cylindrical has a dark green skin and elongated fleshy stem. This creeping plant has yellow flowers and five lobed leaves (Ferriol et al., 2003). The zucchini is considered as a hybrid of cucumber (Tanaka et al., 2013). The information about C . pepo. L var cylindrical (zucchini) in the literature is either related to its phylogenetic origin or otherwise about the nutrient present in the seed oil, but no information has been found about hydrodynamic properties in relation to the solution behaviour of zucchini polysaccharides. This study involves characterization of polysaccharide from zucchini to identify the sedimentation coefficient, viscosity, diffusion coefficient and molecular weight. Information about these hydrodynamic parameters could be beneficial for industrial application(s) of this polysaccharide. This is particularly relevant to the pharmaceutical industry where there is always a need for the development of drug formula tions using novel natural ingredients. 135 4.2 Methodology Details of extraction of the polysaccharide from C. pepo and the hydrodynamic analysis used are essentially similar to the previously mentioned polysaccharide in Chapter 3. Briefly, the polysacchari de was extracted from the pulp of zucchini using an ethanol extraction method (Section 3.2.1). Further purification was performed by fractionation using gel chromatography (Section 3.2.2). Two fractions of zucchini polysaccharide were collected. The first batch of eluent was named as NJZIF1 and the second one was NJZIF2. Hydrodynamic analysis involved use of the analytical ultracentrifuge to determine the sedimentation coefficient, sedimentation coefficient distribution and the molecular weight (molar mass ). A viscometer was also used to determine intrinsic viscosity and dynamic light scattering was used to estimate size distribution and the translational diffusion coefficient of the polysaccharides. Sample preparation for hydrodynamic analysis was carried out in the PBS buffer, pH 7.0, ionic strength =0.1M. 136 4.3 Results and Discussion 4.3.1.1 Total sugar test and Uronic acid detection After extraction the freeze dried powder was tested for the presence of polysaccharide and specifically uronic acid. A sta ndard curve was plotted for concentration of sample/ standard against absorbance. Figure 4.1 and 4.2 indicates the positive result for the presence of polysaccharides and uronic acid in extracted zucchini polysaccharide. 200 400 600 800 10000.000.050.100.150.200.25 Glucose standard ZucchiniAbsorbance at 490 nm Concentration ( g/ml) Total sugar test Figure 4.1: Standard curve to confirm presence of polysaccharide in the extracted samples 137 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 1600.00.30.60.9Difference of Absorbance 450-400 Concentration g/ml Glucouronic acid standard Zucchini Figure 4.2: Standard curve to confirm presence of uronic acid in the extracted polysaccharide samples 4.3.1.2 Phenol sulphuric acid test and fractionation of After extractions, all polysaccharides were fractionated through gel chromatography (details in Section 3.2.2). The eluted fractions were tested for the presence of polysaccharide using the phenol sulphuric acid test (s ee Section 3.2.2.1). The elution profile depicted two distinguishable sets of polysaccharide. Cut off point for fraction 1 and 2 was decided on the basis of the elution profile shown in Figure 4.3. 138 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180012345 Fraction 2Absorbance (525nm) Volume (ml)Fraction 1 Figure pepo from Gel chromatography 400, Column length 2.1 x 50cm) . Absorbance of the eluate was measured at 525nm. Respective fractions were then freeze dried to obtain a powder for further analysis. 4.3.2 Sedimentation velocity Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed using the analytical ultracentrifuge to determine the sedimentation coefficient and sedimentation coefficient distribution of the zucchini polysaccharide and the fractions of this polysaccharide obtained a fter purification. A series of concentrations of the sample polysaccharide was performed to reduce the effect of non -ideality from the sample. 139 4.3.2.1 Unfractionated polysaccharide As observed from the distribution obtained from the ls -g*(s) vs s plots t he polysaccharide sample was highly polydisperse and heterogeneous. The distributions showed wide, broad, discrete boundaries with a shoulder on one side of the distribution as observed in C. moschata polysaccharide. However, with increasing concentration of sample there was no significant change observed in the position of the peaks (Figure 4.4 A) 140 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 120.00.51.01.52.0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 120.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.0ls-g*s Sedimentation coefficient C. pepo polysaccharide in 0.1M PBS, pH 7.0 using (A) ls -g*(s) and (B) c(s) The c(s) vs s plot method - with greater resolving power - was used for further analysis. Four prominent species were detected using c(s) vs s analysis (Figure 4.4 B) and the sedimentation coefficient of each species was increasing slightly with increasing concentration. The possible reason for this change not being picked up during the analysis using ls -g*s was the obscurity of the ls -g*s through diffusion effects which could lead to the appearance of the broad peaks in sedimentation coefficient profile wh ereas; the diffusion correction in c(s) provided the information 141 about the presence of distinct species in the sample polysaccharide. Values of the weight average s 20,w were also obtained for each peak from SEDFIT software (Dam and Schuck, 2004 ). From plotting the weight average sedimentation coefficient s020,w of the peaks against concentration, an s020,w can be obtained. Figure 4.5 shows the sedimentation coefficient plotted against concentration. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 81.31.41.51.61.71.81.92.0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 81.82.02.22.42.62.83.0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 83.03.54.04.55.05.56.06.5 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 70123456789101112 ASedimentation 4.5: Concentration dependence of the sedimentation coefficient for (A) 1st species, (B) 2nd species, (C) 3rd and (D) 4th species from unfractionated C. pepo polysaccharides in PBS (pH 7.0, I= 0.1M) . 142 As expected for a polysaccharide, 3 of the 4 species had a downward slope in the s vs c plot, which means the sedimentation coefficient is decreasing with increasing concentration because of the effects of non -ideality (effects which vanish to zero in the limit c=0 ) . On the other hand, the fourth species had the opposite behaviour. This could be due to the self -association among the sedimenting species or it was just the contamination in the sample. Nevertheless , during further purification this 4th species was lost. The s020,w values (s 20,w values - or the reciprocal thereof - extrapolated to c=0 ) thus obtained for each species and their weight percentages are listed in Table 4.1.

Analysis was made using both ls -g*(s) vs s and c(s) vs s analyses. ls -g*s vs s yielded broad distributions for both fractions and it was not possible to evaluate any clear difference in sedimentation properties between them (Figure 4.6) . 144 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 120.000.250.500.751.001.251.501.75 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 ls -g*(s) vs s, for the two fractions of C. pepo polysaccharide in PBS (pH7.0, I=0.1M) When c(s) vs s analysis was performed, it was observed for fraction 1 (NJZIF1) or \"F1\" that there were 3 prominent species in the sample solution. For fraction 2 (NJZIF2) or \"F2\" two prominent species were detected (Figure 4.7). 145 Thus the number of major species of polysaccharide present decreased gradually upon increased fractionation.

Although multiple species were detected in higher concentrations of unfractionated material, there was a lack of consistency in the appearance of these species in further dilutions. Interestingly in fraction1, three prominent species were detected in most of the dilution s of the sample. However, in fraction 2, the number of detected species was reduced to one.

A series of concentrations was prepared using 0.1M PBS at pH 7.0. The SEDFIT -M* algorithm of Schuck, Harding and co -workers (Schuck et al., 2014 ) was used to calculate the apparent mo lecular weight for each concentration. The weight average molecular weight (M w0 app) was obtained from the intercept of the plot (M w,app vs concentration) at zero concentration to remove the effects of non ideality. The software also calculates molecular weight at the \"Hinge point\". The hinge point is the radial position where the local concentration is equal to the initial loading concentration. Therefore, ideally the weight average molecular weight from the M* extra polation to the cell base should be equal to the molecular weight calculated at the hinge point (Schuck et al., 2014 ; Gillis et al., 2013 ). It gives an internal check for consistency of the analysis. Besides hinge point the SEDFIT -M* also provides an estimate for the molecular weight distribution, c(M) vs M approach, which is based on the direct modelling of the experimental distribution by least square method and gives low resolution molecular weight (Schuck et al., 2014 ). Figure 4.14, 4.15 and 4.16 include the example of the data obtained for C. pepo polysaccharides (unfractionated 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5505560657075808590951006.99 7.02 pepo polysaccharide at 1mg/ml with molecular weight 77000 Da.

A ) Unfractionated C. pepo polysaccharide; B) C) NJZIF2 159 The molecular weight of impure polysaccharide was less than the rest of the fractions. The reason behind this could be that in an unfractionated sample the very high molecular weight species sedimented before it could reach equilibrium as this happened wit h the C. moschata polysaccharide (section 3.2.2.2). Hence the molecular weight thus obtained for the impure polysaccharide did not truly represent all species present in the sample. That is why the molecular weight analysis was carried out further for eac h purified fraction. Table 4.4 includes information for Molecular weight (the weight average molecular weight and hinge point molecular weight) and PDI (M z/Mw -obtained through SEDFIT_M *). The molecular weight for 1st purified polysaccharide fraction was h igher than the impure fraction as well as the subsequent fraction. A curvature in the ln(c) vs r2 plot points out the high polydispersity in the system under observation (Figure 4.11). Furthermore, the results obtained from polydispersity index (M z/Mw) als o confirmed the same prospective (Table 4.4) in the subsequent fraction (NJZIF2) reduction in the molecular weight as well as polydispersity was observed.

Therefore, the weight average molecular weight was represent ative of the whole group of species present in the sample . 161 4.3.4 Viscosity Intrinsic viscosity [] depends upon the hydrodynamic volume of a molecule and is therefore a reflection of its size (conformation and molecular weight). The Viscosity of the polysaccharide from Zucchini was measured in 0.1M phosphate buffer saline at pH 7.0. Figure 4.18 includes a plot for the calculation of intrinsic viscosity. To eliminate the effect of non -ideality a series of concentration s were used to calc ulate viscosity and extrapolated to zero. To obtain more confidence in data Solomon Ciuta, Huggins and Kraemer approaches were used to evaluate viscosity. All plots should intersect at zero concentration. It was observed that intrinsic viscosity changed ra pidly upon fractionation. Furthermore, there was also a noteworthy difference in 1st and 2nd fraction. Probably NJZIF1 had more expanded conformation and had the capacity to absorb more solvent . However, our limited knowledge about the conformation restri cts our conclusion about the nature of the (ml/g) Figure 4.18: Viscosity plots for polysaccharide extracted from Zucchini in phosphate buffer saline (pH 7.0, I=0.1 M) where (A) is unfractionated and (B) and (C) are fractionated and purified polysaccharide (NJZIF1 and NJZIF2) from Zucchini . A comparison of intrinsic viscosity and molecular weight (the latter as calculated through sedimentation equilibrium) provides us some clue about the conformational changes. It was observed where there was an increase in viscosity there was an 163 increase in molecular weight which pointed out conformational changes in the sample. The values thus calculated are mentioned in Table 4.5 Table 4.5: intrinsic viscosity and molec ular fractionated pepo Unfractionated Fraction 1 Fraction [] 73.9 \u00b1 0.5 38.6\u00b1 78 2 95\u00b1 intrinsic viscosity of C. pepo unfractionated polysaccharide was lower and fractionated material was higher as compared to the C. moschata and C. maxima . This probably reflects the different molecular weights. 164 4.3.5 Diffusion coefficient Dynamic light scattering is a useful tool to estimate the size distribution and diffusion coefficient of biopolymers . Measurements were carried out at series of concentrations using the lowest scattering angle on the Malvern DLS photometer (12. 80). D020,w was calculated from the intercept of the plot between concentration and diffusion coefficient. for (A) unfractionated polysaccharide species 1, (B) unfractionated polysaccharide species 2, A and B are clearly particulates not macromolecules (C) Fraction 1 species 1& 2, (D) Fraction 2 species 1& 2. Where 2nd species seems to be agglomerate d. Two species were detected in unfractionated and fractionated material (figure 4.19). Although the basic relationship of size and diffusion coefficient was maintained but again like molecular weight and viscosity fraction 1 had highest r H values as compar ed to the other two (table 4.6) 166 Table 4.6: Diffusion coefficient hydrodynamic radius for C. pepo polysaccharides, where D020,w is the diffusion coefficient and radius. polysaccharide Species 2 (8.20\u00b1 0.3) X 10-9 259 NJZI fraction 1 Species 1 (1.95 \u00b1 0.2) X 10-8 185 NJZI fraction 1 Species 2 (2.94 \u00b1 0.9) X 10-7 17 NJZI fraction 2 Species 1 (1.70 \u00b1 0.2) X 10-8 125 NJZI fraction 2 Species 2 (1.49 \u00b1 0.3) X 10-7 14 The size of the 2nd species reduced from unfractionated material to fraction 2 and after fractionation the second species size was massively reduced and hence there was an increase in diffusion coefficient of t his species. It can be concluded that most of the species seen are agglomerates, with only Species 2 of the fractions appearing in the macromolecular range. 167 Conclusion It is evident from the number of species observed during sedimentation velocity exper iment that the polysaccharides extracted from C. pepo were highly polydisperse and heterogeneous. It was expected that the polydispersity and heterogeneity in the sample will be reduced after fractionation. The number of species was gradually reduced after fractionation as observed through SV interference op tics but polydispersity remained high (PDI). Interestingly sedimentation velocity absorbance optics revealed presence of colour absorbing chromatophores and proteins attached to the polysaccharide. Plant materials are rich in these substances and in case o f C. pepo they could not be removed during extraction as well as fractionation. Furthermore, fraction 1 gave higher molecular weight and higher viscosity as compare to the unfractionated polysaccharide as well as the preceding fraction. The major species i n the same fraction also found to have higher r H values as compare to the other two polysaccharide material under investigation. Besides, the PDI also appeared to be high for fraction 1. Table 4.7 includes a summary of all the work performed on C. pepo polysaccharide during this study. 168 Table 4.7: Data summary for all hydrodynamics parameters measured % s20,w(S3) 19 \u00b1 0.1 45 6.1 \u00b1 0.2 22 5.8 \u00b1 0.4 14 83 \u00b1 2 24.7 \u00b1 1.2 (1.3 \u00b1 0.1) X 10-8 (8.2\u00b1 0.3) X 10-9 165 260 F1 1.9 \u00b1 0.1 74 5.6 \u00b1 0.3 14 9.1 \u00b1 0.8 12 NA 142\u00b1 1 73.9\u00b10. 5 (2.0 \u00b1 0.2) X 10-8 (1.4 \u00b1 0.9) X 10-7 185 15 F2 3.6 \u00b1 0.2 76 6.2 \u00b1 0.4 24 NA NA 89 \u00b1 1 38.6\u00b1 0.3 (1.7\u00b1 0.2) X10-8 (2.0 \u00b1 0.3) X 10-7 125 10 169 It is possible that fractionation led to some conformational change and the presence of the non -polysaccharide substances could have contributed to the higher values for all hydrodynamic parameters. It would be interesting to carry out conformational studies on this polysaccharide materi al. However, time limitations and unavailability of data obtained under multiple similar conditions conformational studies could not be carried out. The Wales-van Holde parameter (k s/[]) could be one possible option to predict the conformation but the he terogeneity in sample and presence of multiple species meant calculation of viscosity for individual species which was not possible using Ostwald viscometer. Besides all these limitations, the conducted study could provide preliminary information on the hydrodynamics information for C. pepo polysaccharides. These results could form the basis for future investigation of this specific macromolecule to be used in pharmaceutical industry as an alternative source of polysaccharide as part of a new drug development . . For future work, it will be interesting to eliminate chromatophores before measurements of hydrodynamic parameters. Use of Magnesium ion containing alkaline solution can be used for this purpose (Meuser an d Bauer, 2012 ). Use of parallel methods like NMR and SAXS will be beneficial to compare the results obtained during current study and to identify unknown details of conformation of C. pepo polysaccharide. 170 Chapter 5: Hydrodynamic analysis of polysaccharides from Cucurbita maxima (Pumpkin) 5.1 Introduction C. maxima Duchesne (Pumpkin) , is reported that the trend of cultivation of this fruit began in South America (Argentina and Uruguay) (Bisognin, 2002 ) and was introduced to Western Europe in 16th Century. Later on, it was cultivated in India, Bangladesh and Myanmar via Spain and is now one of the most cultivated crops in these areas (Ferriol et al., 2004 ). It is a creeping plant with oblate or oblong fruit s weighing a pprox imately 8-20 kg having a variety of skin colour shades (orange, yellow or green) (Dubey, 2012 ). This chapter includes detailed hydrodynamic characterisation of the C. maxima polysaccharide extracted from the pulp of the fruit. Extraction was followed by fractionation of polysaccharide. This allowed the evaluation of structural differences among different molecular weight components and their behaviour in solution. 171 5.2 Methodology Polysaccharide from pumpkin fruit pulp was extr acted in a similar method mentioned in Section 3.2.1. The extracted polysaccharide was subjected to fractionation using gel chromatography (refer to section 3.2.2 for details). Two fractions were collected: the first batch of eluent was named as NJPNF1 and the second as NJPNF2. Hydrodynamic analysis was performed on respective polysaccharides using Beckman sedimentation coefficient, sedimentation coefficien t distribution and the molecular weight (molar mass) followed by the use of capillary viscometry, to determine intrinsic viscosity, and dynamic light scattering to evaluate the size distribution and translational diffusion coefficients of the polysacchari des. All polysaccharide samples were prepared in 0.1M PBS buffer at pH 7.0. 172 5.3 Results and Discussion 5.3.1Total sugar test and Uronic acid detection Followed by extraction, the extracted powder of polysaccharide was tested for the presence of polysacc haride and uronic acid. For this purpose the total sugar test and uronic acid detection was carried out (See section 3.2.1.4 for details). A standard curve was plotted for concentration of sample/standard against absorbance . Both tests yielded positive res ults. Figure 5.1A and B includes plots for both test results. 0 200 400 600 800 10000.000.020.040.060.080.100.120.140.160.18 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 1400.00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.9 Glucose standard Pumpkin polysaccharideAbsorbance at 490 nm Concentration nm Concentration g/mlBA Figure 5.1: (A) Standard curve to confirm presence of polysaccharide in the freeze dried material obtained at the end of extraction from C. maxima (Pumpkin), (B) Standard curve to confirm the presence of Uronic acid in the extracted polysaccharide samples from C. maxima . 173 5.3.2 Phenol -sulphuric acid test and fractionation of polysaccharide As mentioned previously (Section 3.2.2) the polysaccharides were subjected to gel chromatography after extraction. The phenol -sulphuric acid test (see Section 3.2.2.1) was used to detect the polysaccharides portion in the eluted fractions. Two discrete pea ks were observed in the elution profile. Hence the fractions were divided in two sets; the first set of eluted polysaccharide termed as NJPNF1 and the second set labelled as NJPNF2 (Figure 5.2). 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 2400.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.5Absorbance (525nm) Volume (ml) Fraction 1 Fraction 2 Figure 5.2: Elution profile of C. maxima from Gel chromatography ( Sephacryl 400, column length 2.1 x 50cm) . the eluate was measured at 5.3.3 Sedimentation Velocity for C. maxima polysaccharide Sedimentation velocity was performed on the C. maxima polysaccharide (fractionated and unfractionated) material using Analytical Ultracentrifugation (AUC) as mentioned in Section 3.2.3. All experiments were performed only in 0.1M PBS, pH 7.0. 5.3.3.1 Unfractionated polysaccharide A display of broad peaks wi th a shoulder on right hand side was observed for unfractionated polysaccharide material using ls -g*(s). As expected for polysaccharides (all molecules that have non -ideality), there was an increase in sedimentation coefficient with a decrease in sample co ncentration. Such change in sedimentation boundary profile is attributed by non -ideality (Figure 5.3A). However, the difference in sedimentation coefficient was insignificant at low concentrations (Figure 5.3B). 175 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 100246810 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 100.00.20.40.60.81.01.21.41.6ls-g*(s) Sedimentation coefficient (S) 7.0 mg/ml profiles, (A) ls -g*(s) at higher concentrations and (B) at lower concentration for unfractionated pumpkin polysaccharide in 0.1M PBS, pH 7.0 at different concentration The high resolving power of c(s) was used to further investigate the sedimentation properties for C. maxima polysaccharide. Multiple peaks were observed under each broad distribution for each concentration. Figure 5.4 includes the sedimentation distribution plot from ls -g*(s) and c(s) where ls -g*(s) did not show any pe ak 176 movement and c(s) revealed multiple peaks for the same concentration of the sample.

However, the broader distribution indicated the presence of multiple species and a single S value thus obtained did not represent the correct estimation of the sedimentati on coefficient of all species present in the system. The c(s) vs s plot was used to estimate the s020,w value for each species present in the sample (Figure (S-1) Concentration (g/ml)B A Figure 5.5: Concentration dependence of the reciprocal sediment ation coefficient for purified pumpkin polysaccharides in 0.1M PBS, pH 7.0 (A) using ls -g*(s) (B) using c(s). 178 The respective sedimentation coefficient values of each species from c.maxima polysaccharide (fractionated and unfractionated) are 5.1: Sedimentation coefficient ( s020,w) & weight percentage of the sedimenting species in the sample consisting of unfractionated polysaccharide from C. maxima in 0.1M PBS, pH 7.0. 5.3.3.2 Fractionated polysaccharide To probe further into the system, the fractionation of polysaccharide was carried out using gel Chromatography ( section 3.2.2 .). Two fractions, NJPN1 and 2 were obtained based on their initial to fina l elution from a gel chromatography column. It was observed that the number of species was increased upon fractionation. Both fractions had three prominent species present in them instead of two as was the case in the unfractionated polysaccharide.

Absorbance optics produces data by detecting the presence of protein or chromatophores present in the polysaccharide sample.

The absorbance in unfractionated polysaccharide could be only due to colour (Light golden) present in the sample which was removed during fractionation. The polysaccharide fractions had light yellow brown (Buff) colour. 187 5.3.4 Sedimentation equilibrium Sedimentation equilibrium was performed using analytical ultracentrifugation for all polysaccharide (fractionated and unfractionated) from C. maxima . Molecular weight calculations were made as for the other two cucurbit polysaccharides (Section 3.3.2.2 and 4.3.3). Apparent molecular weight was determined using SEDFIT -M* algorithm of Schuck, Harding and Co -workers (Schuck et al., 2014 ) for each concentration of sample in 0.1 MPBS (pH7.0). Information for the baseline and concentration at the meniscus was generated by the c(M) algorithm with in SEDFIT calculate apparent molecular weight for each concentration. To explain the outcome of SEDFIT -MSTAR for C. maxima polysaccharides, one concentration from each polysaccharide (fractionated and unfractionated material) is presented in figures belo w (Figure 5.11, 12 and 13). The M* extrapolation to the base of the cell (Figure 5.11c) ignoring the sharp turn up near the cell base gives an estimate of 75kDa for M w,app. Ln(c) vs r2 plot (Figure 5.11b) and the M w,app (r) vs C (r) plot (Figure 5.11d), both also displayed upward (positive) slopes near the cell base which indicates considerable polydispersity in the system. The polydispersity index (z/w) of the system was calculated as 1.9 (Table 5.4). Figure 5.11: SEDFIT -M* data for analysis on unfractionated C. maxima polysaccharide at 1mg/ml with molecular weight 92,000 Da.

The red line repre sents the fit from c(M). the green line represents linear regression. For fractionated polysaccharide (Figure 5.12 and 5.13), distribution for molecular weight provided by c(M) algorithm indicated the weight average molecular weight to be 16.5 and 51.3kDa respectively (Figure 5.12a & 5.13a). The M* extrapolation to the base of the cell, estimated by c(M) (Figure 5.12c & 5.13c) also agreed to this estimation and shows similar weight average molecular weight values, therefore, 189 there was no need to make any linear regression because of the appropriate extrapolation by the software. 0 100000 7.00 7.02 7.04 r^2 (cm Figure 5.12: Sedfit M* data for analysis on 1st fraction of C. maxima polysaccharide at 1.0 mg/ml with molecular weight 16,500 Da.

Reciprocal of molecular weight at each concentration was obtained using Sedfit M*. Extrapolation of molecular weight obtained at multiple concentrations was used to evaluate the molecular weight of unfractionated and fractionated pol ysaccharide from C. maxima 192 It appeared that the molecular weight of fraction 1 was higher than the unfractionated polysaccharide and the preceding fraction. It is the same behaviour which was observed in C. pepo polysaccharide (Section 4.3.3). Polydispersity remained high for all polysaccharide especially in lower concentrations in C. maxima (>1.2) (Figure 5.11 -5.13) however, a drop in PDI after fractionation was observed. Fraction 1 had the lowest PDI value (Table 5.4). Table 5.4: Molecular wei ght for C. maxima polysaccharides calculated through SEDFIT_MSTAR.

The value for viscosity thus obtained was very close to the other two unfractionated cucurbit polysaccharides (chapter 3 and 4) . However, there was significant reduction in viscosity after fractionation of the C. maxima polysaccharides. This decr ease in viscosity did not correspond to the molecular weights obtained for the respective fractions. This could possibly be due to 194 deterioration of the sample or certain conformational changes. The possible reason for deterioration could be activation of c ertain polysaccharide degrading enzyme that would be co -extract ed and required some time for activation . It is possible that the storage conditions for freeze dried fractionated polysaccharide were not approp riate for C. maxima polysaccharide . However, the other two cucurbit polysaccharides remained unaffected (chapter 3 and 4) . Therefore, the data for viscosity for C. maxima polysaccharide after fractionation was excluded. 195 5.3.6 Dynamic Light Scattering Experiments with dynamic light scattering were performed to identify the diffusion coefficient and radius of hydration of the polysaccharide from C. maxima . A series of concentration was used to calculate the D 20,w. The D020,w was calculated from the inte rcept of the plot of D 20,w versus concentration (Figure 5.16). 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.05.0x10-91.0x10-81.5x10-82.0x10-82.5x10-8 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.56.0x10-98.0x10-91.0x10-81.2x10-81.4x10-81.6x10-81.8x10-8 0.0 0.4 0.8 1.2 1.6 2.0 2.4 2.8 3.2 3.62.50x10-95.00x10-97.50x10-91.00x10-81.25x10-81.50x10-81.75x10-82.00x10-8Diffusion coefficient (cm2/sec) Concentration (mg/ml)A 5.16: Diffusion coefficient plot against concentration for (A) unfractionated (B) Fraction 1 and (C) fraction 2 196 Unlike the other two cucurbits ( C. moschata and C. pepo .) (Chapter 3 & 4) used during this study only a single species was detected using the light scattering method. Interestingly, there was an insignificant difference in diffusion coefficient and hydrodynamic radius (r H) of the polysaccharides under investigation. However, besides being trivial difference an increase in r H and decrease in diffusion coefficient was observed for fraction 1 (Table 5. 5). Table 5. 5: Diffusion coefficient hydrodynamic radius for C. maxima polysaccharides, where D020,w is the diffusion coefficient and rH refers to the hydrodynamic radius. Unfractionated Fraction 1 Fraction 2 D020,w 0.4 rH (nm) 204 193 212 It is possible that these particles were present in the form of large aggregates that dominated the smaller species in the sample. Hence it was only possible to observe a single species in the sample. 197 5.4 Conclusion This chapter describes the hydrodynamic characterization of the polysaccharide extracted from C. ma xima (Pumpkin). The polysaccharide from C. maxima was fractionated after extraction. The aim of this study was to understand the solution structure of the C. maxima polysaccharide as a whole and when it was fractionated. Major parameters evaluated during this study are summarized in Table 5. 6. Table 5. 6: Data summary for all hydrodynamics parameters 1.04 \u00b1 204 F1 \u00b1 0.01 7 269 \u00b1 107 0.4 193 F2 1.52 \u00b1 0.05 66 4.17\u00b1 0.08 25 6.25 \u00b1 0.3 9 93 \u00b1 12 1.00 \u00b1 0.4 212 The extracted polysaccharide was polydisperse in nature as it was observed through c(s) analysis. Number of species present was increased after fractionation which was a clear indication of increase in polydispersity and conformational changes. Moreover, the molecular weight of the first fraction was found to be higher 198 than the unfractionated polysaccharide. This behaviour was in agreement for what was observed for the molecular weight of other two cucurbit species where an increase in molecula r weight was observed after fractionation (See Table 3.4 and 4.5, Chapter 3 and 4 respectively). Viscosity of a macromolecule depends upon its conformation and molecular weight. The higher molecular weight fractions of the polysaccharide give extremely low viscosity which indicated deterioration in the sample. It would be helpful if viscosity could be measured through alternative methods like Viscostar in SECMAL S. The d iffusion coefficient and the hydrodynamic radius of the unfractionated and fractionated polysaccharide did not show any significant changes. The dynamic light scattering is a useful method but the method has its own limitations; it is difficult to interpret the diffusion coefficient and hydrodynamic radius when the sample is composed of large particulates hiding smaller ones. Pumpkin polysaccharide has been previously characterized and C. maxima has been studied previously because of its multiple health benefits and polysaccharide from seed cotyledon has also been character ized (Wakabayashi et al., 1990 ) but at the time of writing there is no literature available that reports biophysical characterization using the same hydrodynamic methods for this specific genus of cucurbit i.e. C. maxima . Present work could serve as a foundation for the future structural investigation and interactive study in various solution environment for polysaccharide extracted from C. maxima . 199 Chapter 6: Structural Insight and Biological activity of the Cucurbit polysaccharides 6.1 Introduction Polysacchar ides have the ability to promote biological activity directly or by the activation of complex reaction cascades (Schepetkin and Quinn, 2006 ; Tzianabos, 2000a ). Some of these biological activities are anti -inflammatory, immunostimulatory, complement activating, antithrombotic, antidiabetic and infection protecting. It also been reported that pectic -type polysaccharides, acetylated glucomannans and glucans are found to activate the complement sy stem and thus possess pharmaceutical importance (Paulsen, 2002 ). Polysaccharides are used in the pharmaceutical industry as an excipient or a binder for drug delivery. Polysaccharides from natural sources provide an alternative and environmen tal friendly option for drug delivery as they are biodegradable, biocompatible and cost effective as compared to the synthetic polymers (Garc\u00eda - Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2011 ; Huang et al., 2006 ). Polysaccharides contain structural variation depending on their source of origin, which includes both the type and part of the plant and also the extraction method. Their structural variation includes heteropolym ers with different monomers, ring sizes, anomeric configurations, glycosidic linkages, and non -carbohydrate moieties. These structural variations of 200 the extracted compounds contribute towards variation in their biological activity (Bohn and BeMiller, 1995 ; Falch et al., 2000 ; Milton et al., 2001 ; Paulsen, 1999 ; Hsieh et al., 2009 ). Thus each compound po ssesses variable significance for pharmaceutical use. Non-specific activation of an immune system using an external source for example, a naturally extracted compound can be helpful in certain ailments. However, development of any drug using natural extrac ts requires the knowledge of its mechanism of action under certain environmental conditions (Xie et al., 2008 ; Guess et al., 2003 ; Darshan and Doreswamy, 2004 ; Hsieh et al., 2009 ; Kumar et al., 2011 ; Schepetkin et al., 2008 ). The fruit of the Cucurbitaceae family is rich in phytochemicals like, carotenoids, gamma amino butyric acids, sterols, as well as proteins, polysaccharides and fixed oils (Adams et al., 2013 ). These components possess the potential for therapeutic application. Similar polysaccharides, from mushrooms & other Basidiomycetes can generate immuno -stimulating responses against multiple diseases such oesop hageal, gastric and lung cancer, herpes infection and diabetes 1998 ). Polysaccharides from Cucurbits have antidiabetic and hypolipidemic properties (Adams et al., 2011 ). This information forms a platform for further analysis of the Cucurbit polysaccharides. This study was carried out to explore the structure of the cucurbit polysaccharide and to explore the imp act of structure on biological behaviour of these polysaccharides. 201 6.1.5 Gas chromatography Gas chromatography (GC) is extensively used for the analysis of carbohydrate materials. It is useful for the separation and analysis of complex mixtures of many components that can undergo vaporization without disintegration (Canteri et al., 2012a ). Column chromatography involves the separation of molecules in the mixture (mobile phase) using a packed column (stationary phase) (which can be a liquid in case of \"gas liquid chromatography\" or a solid in case of \"gas solid chromatography\"). The degree of adsorption of a molecule to the column determines how fast it will elute out of the column (Hedhammar et al., 2006 ; McNair and M iller, 2009 ). As shown in Figure 6. 1, as an illustrative example, a sample made up of two components A and B is introduced onto the column (horizontal lines in the figure) for separation. With the passage of time the sample passes through the column. Any portion of the sample component above the horizontal line can be considered as in the mobile phase and anything below as in the stationar y phase. 202 Figure 6. 1: Schematic representation of Chromatographic process. Black horizontal lines represent stationary phase on the column whilst the arrows represent flow of the mobile phase through this column with component A and B suspended in it (McNair and Miller, 2009 ) Both components of the sample are partitioned between two phases during the course of separation. This is indicated as a distribution above (amount of sample in the mobile phase) and below the line (amount of sample in the stationary phase). The component with greater distribution (component A in the figure) in the mobile phase is carried down to the column faster compared to the component with smaller distribution in mobile phase (component B in figure). Thus, separation of the two components takes place a s they pass down through the column. The detector attached to the instrument detects individual components as they leave the column and thus a chromatogram for each separated component can be produced. 203 GC is a preferred technique because of multiple virtu es that includes rapid analysis, effectiveness in producing high resolution, sensitivity of detection even for the trace amount of substances thus GC can analyse small amount of samples. Requirement of the thermally stable and volatile sample has limited the use of this method to some extent (Dickes and Nicholas, 1976 ). Mor eover, GC requires coupling with Mass spectrometric analysis for correct identification of the peak (Masasucci and Caldwell, 2004 ). 6.1.5.1 Instrumentation There are six basic components in a chromatographic system. These are as follows 1. Carrier gas 2. Flow control 3. Sampling devices 4. Columns 5. Ovens 6. Detectors The schematic presentation of these components is given in Figure 6. 2. 204 Figure 6. 2: Schematic presentation of gas chromatography instrumentation (McNair and Miller, 2009 ) 6.1.5.2 Carrier gas The mobile phase of the system is composed of an inert gas which is referred as a carrier gas. This gas provides a suitable matrix for the detector to measure the sample components. Besides being inert, the carrier gas should also be 99.99% pure to avoid any detrimental effects on the column. Additionally, the selection of the mobile phase (carrier gas) is also detector specific that is the choice of carrier gas mostly depends upon the type of the detector. For example, for thermal conductivity detectors either helium or hydrogen is used. For flame ionization 205 detection, helium and nitrogen are the choices. For electron capture detector very dry oxygen free detector is recommended. Moreover, while choosing the gas for the system it is also important to obtain 99.99% pure gas. The presence of contaminants like oxygen or water can have detrimental effects on column (MacLeod, 1973 ; McNair and Miller, 2009 ). 6.1.5.3 Flow control It is one of the most important parameter for qualitative analysis. Flow rate helps to determine retention time. The knowledge of the retention time can be helpful in the identification of the compound present in the solute. Therefore, accuracy in the flow rate is highly desirable in qualitative analysis of a compound. For qualitative analysis it is extremely important to have reproducible retention times. The reproducibility of retention times in turn depends on the reproducible flow r ate. Additionally correct flow rate is also responsible for the strength of the column. Flow rate needs to be determined experimentally for the specific column (McNair and Miller, 2009 ). 6.1.5.4 Sample injection Sample is introduced to GC through an inlet with self -sealing septum (Figure 5.5). The septum is used to avoid any leakage. A sample injection size depends on the concentrations of the analytes (components) in the sample, the dimensions of the column and the sensitivity of the detector (Par\u00e9 and B\u00e9langer, 1997 ). The injection mode could be split/ splitless. In a split injection, the major portions of the introdu ced sample are considered as lost and only the small part of the injected 206 sample is introduced to the column. The most widely used injection method, split injection, involves introduction of the entire injected sample onto the GC capillary. The limitations to this method include thermal degradation of the analytes; injection volume is limited to be 1\u00b5l due to the expansion of the solvent volume (upto150 to1000\u00b5l) therefore, in this respect the pulsed splitless injection offers a solution by increasing the c olumn head pressure, thus increasing the flow rate for carrier gas and rapid movement of the sample vapours through the column (MacLeod, 1973 ; Otles, 2008 ). 6.1.5.5 The columns The columns are the major component of the instrument. Columns are the tubular structures that can be available as coiled, bent into U -shaped or straight. In the case of a solid stationary phase, the columns are coated with a solid surface, for example, carbonaceous material, aluminium, polystyrene or fused silica which is coated with the stationary liquid phase. The solid stationary phase helps to avoid problems like column bleed and thus provides higher selectivity at higher temperatures. To avoid peak ta iling (shoulder on one side of the peak) with compounds of low volatility use of liquid stationary phase is also recommended. Examples include silicones and polyether, glycols, (R\u00f6del, 1977 ). The cho ice of the stationary phase is made based on the retention property of the system and ability to separate compounds with different functional groups (Par\u00e9 and B\u00e9langer, 1997 ). 207 In this study, fused silica capillary columns were used. These columns are wall coated open silica column where there is no packing mater ial and a thin film of liquid phase covers the inside wall of the 0.25mm fused silica layer. These are the most inert column with very efficient separation. 6.1.5.6 Ovens or controlled temperature zones: The columns are also the zones of controlled temper ature fitted between a heated injection port and heated detector. It is possible to control the temperature of the columns between 37 to 360oC. Temperature of the heated injection port should be somewhere between vaporization point of the sample and its th ermal stability. It is recommended to have an inlet temperature 50oC higher than the boiling point of the sample. The temperature of the column should be hot enough to provide efficient separation but not too high to avoid degradation of sample. It is not necessary to have column temperature above the boiling point of the sample. For GC column, it is important to have temperature above the dew point (vapor point) and not the boiling point of the sample. The temperature of the detector depends upon the natu re of the detector used. In any case, it should be high enough to avoid condensation of the sample. Sample condensation can lead to peak broadening, loss of the base line and even the loss of the peak (McNair and Miller, 2009 ). 208 6.1.5.7 Detectors A detector is the part of the equipment that receives signals from the separating solution mixture passing through the column and gives a chromatogram for separating eluents. The detector signals correspond to the quantity of each component of the eluting sample. Out of many three most popular detectors are briefly discussed here. Flame ionization detector (FID) are simple, cheap and highly sensitive and most commonly used detectors for GC (McNair and Miller, 2009 ; Dickes and Nicholas, 1976 ). FID can detect mass as low as 0.01 to 0.1ng. The sample to be analyzed is burnt into ions to form a small current. This current of ions acts as a signal for the detector. This detector is more sensitive to organic compounds except formic acid and methane (Lundanes et al., 2014 ). For inorganic analytes a thermal conductivity cell detector (TCD) is the popular selection. This detector works by comparing thermal conductivity of pure carrier gas with carrier gas containing sample analytes in it (McNair and Miller, 2009 ). Electron capture detectors are very specific and sensitive type of detec tor for the sample that can be capture electrons. These electrons are produced when carrier gas is induced to produce electrons. The extent of absorption is proportional to the concentration of the analytes (McNair and Miller, 2009 ). 209 6.1.6 Gas with Mass spectrophotometry The mass spectrometer when coupled with Gas chromatography can work as a detector of ions. The ions are produced after ionization of the analytes present in the sample mixture. 6.1.6.1 Instrumentation The instrument consists of the following 1. an ionization source, 2. a mass to charge separation chamber (the analyzer) and 3. a detector for ions (Lundanes et al., 2014 ). As the name indicates, it is a mass sensitive instrument where detection relies upon the sample concentration and the mobile phase flow rate. 6.1.6. 1.1 The ionization source The ion source provides the energy necessary to promote ionization. To prevent analyte condensation, it is important to maintain a high temperature but not as high as to evaporate the vapors. GC -MS uses two types of ionization proces ses. These are electron ionization and chemical ionization. The distance between the capillary column and the ion source should be kept to a minimum. The reduced distance helps to get most of the analyte delivered to the ion source without any wastage. This can also prevent thermal degradation of the sample (Masasucci and Caldwell, 210 2004 ). This chamber contains a number of lenses and slits to direct the ions to pass through in a single line towards the mass analyzer (Wang and Pare', 1997 ). The analytes or the mole cules of the sample in gas phase at low pressure are ionized and positive mono isotropic molecular ions are formed. The ionization process excites the molecules and the fragmentation of these molecules occurs due to surplus energy present in the molecules after ionization. In a GC -MS system everything placed in the GC column will pass through MS, therefore, volatility of the sample is vital for the process. The non - volatile sample may deposit in the ionization chamber resulting in the damage to the instru ment. Volatilization of the sample, on the other hand, is useful as it enhances the detection limits of the MS (Masasucci and Caldwell, 20 04). 6.1.6. 1.2 The Analyzer From the ionization chamber the ions enter into the mass analyzer where each ionized ion produces a fragmentation pattern after mass analysis. This fragmentation pattern is specific for each compound. A comparison of the sample spectra with the reference spectrum library can be helpful in the correct identification of the compound. There are number of mass analyzers available and selection of anyone is determined through number of required parameters. This includes the ran ge of separated mass with accuracy, sensitivity and resolution. The upper mass limit of separation of charge for a mass analyzer coupled with GC is m/z 1000. GCMS has this distinctive ability to separate two peaks of ions with the same mass. Therefore the mass resolution (m) is the minimum difference in mass among the two peaks 211 having the same magnitude, thus the valley formed between these two pe aks is called as the fraction of the peak height. The mass resolving power can be described as the mass of the peak to the difference of mass among the two peaks (m/m) (Otles, 2008 ). 6.1.6. 1.3 The Detector Role of a detector is to sense reproducibility of ions. Mass resolved ions from the analyzer head towards the ion detector. These signals generated by the mass analyzer due to the interaction of ions are detected by the detector. The number of signals received must be proportional to the number of ions. This property is important in order to quantitate the sample. 212 6.2 Methodology 6.2.1 Extraction and Fractionation Extraction and fractionation of the cucurbit polysaccharide was performed as mentioned in the chapter 3 (Section 3.2) Figure 6. 3 include s an outline of the methodology. The three cucurbit used were Cucurbita moschata, C. pepo and C. maxima. In this section the complement fixation assay, methanolysis procedure for monosaccharide composition determination using gas chromatography and the derivatization of polysaccharide using GC -MS are described. 213 Figure 6. 3: Flow diagram to present an outline of the work carried out to determine structure and bioactivity of the cucurbit polysaccharides 6.2.2 Complement Fixation To perform complement fixation, methodology of (Michaelsen et al., 2000 ) was followed. Sheep red blood c ells (sRBCs) were isolated from normal sheep blood (with citrate as an anticoagulant). Supernatant was removed. The blood cells were washed twice with phosphate buffer saline (PBS, pH 7.0 in the ratio of 1:10) and with verenol buffer 214 saline (0.2 mM CaCl 2, 0.8 mM MgCl 2 with 2 mg/ml Bovine serum albumin) at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes at 200C. 1% suspension of SRBC was made with verenol buffer. Sensitization of SRBCs was performed using from of 1:400. SRBCs were incubated for 30 minutes in shaking incubator (Labnet international, Inc.) at 370C. Sensitized cells were washed once with PBS and twice with Verenol buffer for 5 minutes at 200C at 1000rpm. The supernatant was r emoved and cells were diluted to 1% dilution using verenol buffer. The standard titration plate was made first to identify the dilution of human serum that will give 50% lysis of the cells. Therefore, dilutions of human serum complement were made in Veren ol buffer (from 1:30 to 1:100 serum to buffer). 50 \u00b5l of each of human serum complement dilution was mixed with 50 \u00b5l of verenol buffer in micro titer plate followed by incubation at 300C for 30 minutes in a shaking incubator. 50 \u00b5l of 1% SRBCs were added to all wells followed by incubation at 300C for 30 minutes in the shaking incubator. The micro titer plate was centrifuged at 1000rpm for 3 minutes and absorbance was measured at 405 nm. Hemolytic titer of the serum was determined by selecting the dilution of the serum giving 50% lysis. Serial dilution of polysaccharide samples were made starting from 250 to 7.8\u00b5g/ml in Verenol buffer. For the complement test, 50\u00b5l of polysaccharide was mixed with 50\u00b5l of human sera complement (with 50% hemolytic titer) in the specific wells of the micro -titer plate and incubated at 300C for 30 minutes in the shaking incubator. Sensitized blood (50\u00b5l) was added to all wells and the micro -titer plate was incubated at 300C for 30 minutes in the shaking incubator. This was fol lowed by 215 centrifugation, transfer to the flat bottom plate and measurement of absorbance as mentioned above. Inhibition of the lysis induced by the polysaccharide sample was used to measure the ICH 50 (which is the concentration of the polysaccharide sampl es required to induce 50% lysis). Inhibition of lysis was calculated using the formula [(A - Atest)/A control] x100% (Gr\u00f8nhaug et al., 2010 ). A plot of inhibition of lysis (%) against the concentration (\u00b5g/ml) of sample was constructed to identify the concentration of sample able to give 50% inhibition. 216 6.2.3 Methanolysis for monosaccharide composition determination using Gas Chromatography Monosaccharide composition was determined using the method of ( Chambers and Clamp 1971) . Briefly, all samples were placed in desiccator for 48 hours to make sure they are water free. 1 mg of each sample was mixed with 100 microliter of internal standard (mannitol in water free methanol, 1mg/ml, Sigma) and 1ml of methanol/ 3M HCl (Supelco analytical) in acid washed tubes. All tubes were placed in a dry oven (Heraeus instrument function line) at 800C for 24 hours. The dried sample was mixed with 1ml of methanol/ 3M HCl (Supelco analytical) followed by Nitrogen blow out. To the dried tubes, 250\u00b5l of water free meth anol was added. This was dried using Nitrogen. This was repeated twice. Desiccator with P2O5 was used to dry the sample further for 1 hour. For TMS derivatization 100 \u00b5l of TMS reagent 2 ml hexamethyldisilazane, 5 ml pyridine) was added to each tube of sample and was left for 30 minutes followed by centrifugation (spectrafuge mini, lanet international, Inc). 1\u00b5l of each sample was loaded on the Gas chromatography instrument (Thermo scientific control, Flow value: 1.4ml/min, Flow nominal: 0.01ml/min. The instrument had flame ionization detector with H 2 and splitt/splittles Injector (Split r atio 1:10). Helium gas (flow 0.70 bar with constant pressure) was used. 217 6.2.4 Derivatization of polysaccharide for Linkage determination using GC -MS GC-MS analysis was performed by the laboratory of Prof. Berit Paulsen, University of Oslo. Derivatization of selected fractions was carried out in order to determine linkage using the following steps 6.2.4 .1 Carboxyl reduction For carboxyl reduction methodology of (Sims and Bacic, 1995 ) was followed with few modifications. 1 mg of each fraction was dissolved in 1 ml distilled water. 200\u00b5l of 0.2M -[N-Morpholino] ethane sulphonic acid of 500mg/ml of carbodiimide ( Sigma Aldrich) were added followed by vortexing and incubation at room temperature (25 - 300C) for 3 hours. 1 ml of 2M TRIZMA base (Tris [hydroxymethyl] amino methane) was added in all samples on ice. Sodium borodeuteride was prepared freshly in 0.05M NaOH (70mg/ml) and was in cubated overnight (18 hours) at 40C. After 24 hours, excessive reductants were destroyed by slowly adding 5X100 \u00b5l glacial acetic acid. Dialysis was performed using PD10 column. 6.2.3.2 Methylation analysis Methylation was carried out as described in (Ciucanu and Kerek, 1984 ).200\u00b5l of water free methanol was added to the sample followed by drying and addition of 500\u00b5l of DMSO (MERCK). Nitrogen blow out was used to pushed the oxygen out 218 (no drying). Teflon faced c aps were used to cover the tubes and tubes were shaken for 20 minutes by placing on orbital shaker. 500 \u00b5l of NaOH in DMSO (120mg/ml) was added to each sample. Nitrogen was used to push the oxygen out of the solution and samples were shaken for 30 minutes . 100 \u00b5l of methyl iodide was added twice followed by 10 minutes mixing. 200 \u00b5l of methyl iodide was added to the solution followed by 20 minutes mixing. Freshly prepared 10 ml of sodium thio sulphate (100 mg/ml in water) was added. 2 ml of Methyl chloride was also added and solution was vortexed for 40 sec. Centrifugation was performed for 3 minutes at 1000g at 200C to separate the two phases. The upper aqueous phase was removed and 5ml of deionized water was added. Lower phase was washed four times. This lower phase was dried using dry nitrogen gas and the tubes were kept in desiccators overnight. 6.2.3.3 Hydrolysis and Reduction To the methylated samples 500\u00b5l of 2.5M TFA (trifluoro acetic acid) was added and tubes were flushed with nitrogen. Samples were kept at 1000C for 2 hours for hydrolysis and then were dried using vacuum drier. Yellow smears were obtained as a result of drying. These yellowish precipitates were dissolved in 500\u00b5l of 4OH. were sonicated for 1 minute and incubate at 600C for 1 hour. Reductant was added slowly 219 and in three turns (3X50\u00b5l). This was followed by vacuum drying of the samples. The method for hydrolysis and reduction of methylated polysac charide was and Bacic, 6.2.3.5 Acetylation Acetylation was performed by adding of 1 -methylimidazole followed by 2ml of acetic anhydri de followed by 10 minutes vigorous vortexing to avoid any crystal formation. To destroy excessive acetic anhydride 10 ml of water was added (The sample became warm due to heat generated during this reaction). The sample was mixed well and was left for 10 m inutes. This was followed by addition of 1ml of dichloromethane (DCM) and centrifugation to get two separate phases. The upper phase was collected and 1ml of DCM was added, vortexed and centrifuged again to collect upper phase. This was repeated one more t ime. All extracts phases were combined and wash with 2x5 ml aliquots of water and was dried with a stream of nitrogen. The product was dissolved in the required amount of DCM (for example, 500\u00b5g sample in 1 ml DCM). Analysis was performed using 1\u00b5l of aliq (Gr\u00f8nhaug al., 2010 ). 220 6.3 Results and Discussion 6.3.1 Complement Fixation All polysaccharide fractions wer e tested for biological activity against human serum using complement fixation assay (Section 6.2.2). All fractions generated an immune response. Inhibition of the lysis induced by the polysaccharide sample was used to measure the ICH 50 (which is the conce ntration of the polysaccharide samples required to induce 50% lysis). Inhibition of lysis was calculated using the formula [(Acontrol Atest)/A control] x100%. A plot of inhibition of lysis (%) against the concentration (\u00b5g/ml) of sample was constructed t o identify the concentration of sample able to give 50% inhibition (Figure 6. 4). 0 50 100 150 200 250 300-70-60-50-40-30-20-100102030405060708090100110120Percentage inhibition of hemolysis Figure 6. 4: Dose dependent activities for the fractions in the complement assay where NJBT 1, 2 and 3= 1, 2nd and 3rd fractions of C. moschata , NJPN1 and 2= 1st and 2nd fractions of C. maxima , NJZI1 and 2= 1st and 2nd fractions of C. pepo . 221 The amount of sample required to give a 50% inhibition of lysis was calculated through the plot for all polysaccharides is given in Table 6. 1. 222 Table 6. 1: ICH 50 value, bioactivity and molecular weight as determined by sedimentation equilibrium of 73 270 469 60 140 45 112 Bioactivity High High Medium Low High Low High Low Molecular weight x103 (g/mol) 279\u00b1 30 14.00\u00b1 0.01 93 \u00b1 12 95\u00b1 4 66 \u00b1 1 223 The rule of thumb is the smaller the amount required to inhibit lysis, the more active the polysaccharide is. It was observed that the higher molecular weight fractions had higher bioactivity. Therefore, for C. moschata polysaccharide, fraction 1 with the highest molecular weight was the most active sample followed by fraction 2 and 3 less. In case of C. maxima and C. pepo , fraction 1 of polysaccharide from both cucurbits had higher activity than the preceding fraction. These results suggest that the bioac tivity of cucurbit polysaccharide is linked to their molecular weight. Furthermore, some of the fractions have a negative effect in the lower concentration ranges. This could be due to the presence of non - polysaccharide components in the samples that wer e quenching the activity. As seen from the carbohydrate determination in Table 6. 2 (Section 6.3.2) the total sugar content was not 100% for any of the polysaccharides. These results confirm the presence of non -sugar residues in the sample. However, ICH 50 value for all pumpkin fractions in the present study are lower th an the ones observed in a different cucurbit ( Cucurbita composition was determined after derivatization of monosaccharides to make them volatile. Polysaccharides become non -volatile after hydrolysis due to the presence of polar groups. Therefore, derivatization is an important step (Section 6.2.3 ). This derivatization is helpful as it provides highly stable derivatives of monosaccharide. These highly stable derivatives give, easy to identify, single peak on the chromatogram (Canteri et al., 2012a ). The monosaccharide components of each fraction are listed in Table 6.3. In all remaining fractions galactouronic acid was the major component followed by rhamnose. 225 Table 6. 2: Percentage of a SINGLE sugar related to the total amount of sugar obtained through gas chromatography It was found that the major component of the C. moschata polysaccharide is the acidic monosaccharide, the galactouronic acid. In addition the highest molecular fraction (279 kDa) from C. moschata polysaccharide (NJBT F1) mainly consisted of neutral monosa ccharides and galactose with trace amount of arabinose. Other monosachharides were not detected in 1st fraction 1 of C. moschata . NJBT F1 NJZI F2 arabinose 0.8 3.6 2.4 1.0 2.0 5.4 3.9 rhamnose 6.2 4.0 2.4 12.8 6.7 3.2 2.2 fucose - 1.0 1.1 0.4 0.84 0.4 1.6 xylose - 0.3 0.1 - - - - galactose 3.0 4.5 4.3 2.7 4.46 32.5 30.1 glucose - 7.3 11.3 - 0.03 2.4 - galacturonic acid 26.4 61.6 64.4 12.0 2.00 2.0 30.8 226 However, presence of glucose was detected in this fraction through GC -MS (Table 6.3, Section 6.3.3). For the mediu m and low molecular weight fractions from C. moschata (NJBTF2 and NJBTF3), the neutral sugars, glucose, galactose, fucose, rhamnose and arabinose were also present in large amounts in addition to the acidic galactouronic acid (Table 6. 2). The results obta ined are in agreement to similar studies performed on the unfractionated sample (Du et al., 2011b ; Yang et al., 2007a ) of the same variety of cucurbit, glucouronic acid was found as the ma jor sugar followed by glucose, galactose and arabinose respectively. However, the monosaccharide content (weight percentage) obtained through this study was not similar. The differences might have occurred due to the difference in the methods adapted for extraction and purifications. In C. maxima duschensne (Pumpkins, PN fractions), the acidic sugar galactouronic acids and the neutral sugar rhamnose were present as the major component in the high molecualr weight fraction (NJPNF1), followed by small amount of galactose and trace amounts of arabinose and fuc ose. The second fraction from C. maxima (NJPNF2), was composed mainly of neutral sugars rhamnose and galactose. Only small amounts of galactouronic acid was detected for this fraction. Polysaccharides from C. pepo Linn var. cylindrica (zucchini) conta ined the highest percentage of neutral sugar galactose which appeared to be the major component in both fractions and it was the highest amount of galactose present in all other cucurbits used during this study. However, the lower molecular weight fraction of C. pepo (NJZI 2) contained galactouronic acid in the equal amount as galactose whilst galactouronic acid amount was farily low in the first fraction. These two 227 polysaccharide fractions from C. pepo also contained highest amount of arabinose (Table 6.3). The similar composition was observed with higher different percentage of monosachcahrides in a different species of C. pepo (C. pepo L. var. Styriaca ) all monosaccharides were present in higher amounts in the air dried and ethanol dried fractions (Ko\u00e1lov\u00e1 et al., 2013b ; Ko\u00e1lov\u00e1 et al., 2013a ). The air dried and ethanol fractions in Kostalova study were comparable to the extracted pumpkin fraction in the present work. To further confirm the results obtained through GC, GC coupled with Mass spectrophotometry was performed because compounds with similar properties mostly have same retention time and thus can lead to incorrect identification. Moreover, th e background peaks can hinder the distinct recognition and quantification of minute amounts of monosaccharide in a complex system (Canteri et al., 2012a ). 6.3.3 Methylation - GCMS Linkage determination Coupling of GC with MS can provide better resolution for the complicated structural units such as the polysaccharides. In addition to the better resolution and separation can be achieved by GC while MS provides charge to mass ratio of the monosaccharide de rivatives thus provide a better identification, high selectivity, specificity, and sensitivity (Canteri et al., 2012a ). The types of linkages present in NJBT F1, NJPN F1, NJZI F1 and NJZI F2 determined by methylation and GC -MS analysis are shown in Table 6. 3. The high molecular weight fractions from three cucurbits were selected for linkage analysis except that both fractions from NJZI F2 were examined. 229 Table 6. 3: Linkages obtained from GC -MS from the cucur bit polysaccharide fractions.

These two form the basic structure of pectin -like sugars (Sriamornsak, 2003a ; Izydorczyk et al. , 2005 ; Owens et al., 1952 ). The (14) linked galactouronic acid forms the smooth region or the linear backbone of the pectin and (1 2) linked rhamnose forms hairy region of pectin (type 1 rhamnogalacturonan). The presence of 1 3, 6 linked galactose and arabinose suggests the presence of arabin ogalactan type II (AGII) side chain. These neutral sugars probably could be attached to RG - I as complex neutral side chains of arabinogalactans on position 4 of rhamnose, and may give rise to the so called hairy region. Trace amount of xylose is also pres ent which is also one of the neutral sugars found in pectins (Voragen et al., 2009 ). It appeared that both fractions from C. pepo (NJZIF1 and 2) have high amount of arabinose and galactose as compare to the other two cucurbits. Presence of (1 2), (15) arabinose in ZIF1 and (1 2), (13), (15) arabinose in ZIF2 indica tes the polysaccharide being an arabinans in nature (Paulsen and Barsett, 2005 ). As both fractions from C. pepo polysaccharide have displayed the characteristics of arabinogalactan type II. Such type of sugars are reported to contain 1 3 linked \u00df - D-galactose backbone with short side chains 1 3, 6 linked galactose (Voragen et al., 2009 ). Furthermore, presence of 1 4 galactouronic acid and 1 2 rhamnose indicates the occurrence of R GI. It is possible that these arabinogalactans are the branch points, forming the complex hairy structure on the rhamnogalacturonan type I (RGI). Arabinose attached terminally to the galactan side chains reduces the activity while arabinose side chains a ttached directly to position 3 of the 1 4 linked galactouronic acid backbone increases the activity These structural features could 231 affect the anti -complementary activity of the polysaccharides (Samuelsen et al., 1996 ) The present work on cucurbit structural analysis was purely based on qualitative analysis. All cucurbit polysaccharides that have been studied as part of this study have shown properties that are possessed by pectin like sugars. This includes presence of g alactouronic acid (Gal A), rhamnose and arabinogalactans. 232 6.4 Conclusion During this study, structural analysis and bioactivity determination of the polysaccharide fractions from cucurbit extracts ( C.moschata, C. pepo, C. maxima ) was carried out . Monosaccharide composition was determined using two complementary methods, gas Chromatography (GC) and gas Chromatography with mass spectrophotometry (GCMS ). It was possible to get reliable information about monosaccharide composition using GC alone but sensitivity of GCMS increased confidence in data and clarified ambiguities in the results . Structural analysis revealed that the samples under investigation were mostly made up of galactouronic acid and rhamnose residues. Presence of these two sugars and the associated linkages confirmed the hypothesis that the analytes are pectin -like sugars. In order to elucidate the exact nature of these polysaccharides, quantitative analysis was an absolute requirement. Unfortunately, t he task could not be carried out due to limitation of time to this study. It seems to be very important for future investigation to look into the quantitative determination of the polysaccharide linkages in order to identify the complete structure of the p olysaccharide from the three cucurbits. It appears that certain fractions (high molecular weight fractions) of polysaccharides were predominantly more active than others in generating immune response as compared to the lower molecular weight. It remained inconclusive if there are certain structural feature s or conformational changes responsible for this property in 233 addition to the molecular weight. It is possible that all active fractions had higher amount of galactouronic acid which could pos sibly have role in bioactivity of these polysaccharides. This is also stated in literature where Immunostimulating effect is linked to the galactouronic acid region of pectin (Popov and Ovodov 2013). Interestingly, polysaccharide from C. pepo appeared to have most complicated structure in contrast to the other two cuc urbit polysaccharides which could be one reason for higher biological activity from the fraction of this sugar . The complexity of monosaccharide composition increased in this order. C. moschat a < C. maxima < C. pepo . It is possible that bioactivity is also linked to certain undetected non -sugar parts of the polysaccharides. The total sugar content obtained from GC was not 100% which indicates presence of other compounds associated with polysaccharides contributing towards their immunological response. The less bioactivity of lower molecular weight component could be due to removal of these undetected biomolecules and hence the reduction in molecular weight during fractionation process. All cucurbit polysaccharide fractions provided immunodulatory action against human serum. Their response varied with the sample concentration. This means this polysaccharide has a potential effect as an immune -modulator. Inhibition of lysis, therefore, is useful and required property in some cases. For example, organ transplantation where immune system is required to be suppressed for a short time in order to allow the transplanted organ to function properly. These findings can be 234 used along with other alr eady collected data during this study to explore the biological activities and future therapeutic nature of these polysaccharides. It will be beneficial for future studies to use alternative method for example ; HPLC (High performance liquid chromatography) for structural analysis . This method unlike GC or GCMS is much simpler and does not require any modifications prior to analysis . ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) can also be used as an alternative assay to check other aspects of biological activity . Chapter -7: Extraction, isolation and characterization of pumpkin seed oil bodies 7.1 Introduction The fruit of the pumpkin plant is usually a fleshy gourd or squash having orange or yellow colour with a few excep tions of dark green, pale green. The fruits enclosed flat, symmetrical and oval seeds . The seeds serve as a reservoir to store food for upcoming dormant period. This reserve can be in form of o il, polysaccharides and proteins, where fats are considerably more effective in terms of providing energy as compare to the equal amount of weight of carbohydrate or proteins (Huang, 1992). The seeds are consumed as snack (roasted, salted, in cooking and baking) in various parts of the world (Xanthopoulou et al., 2009). The oil produced by the pumpkin seed is highly viscous and green in colour popularly used as a dressing for salad in southern Austria (Styria), Slovenia and Hungary snacks (Rezig et al., 20 12; Procida et al., 2013 ; Murkovic et al., 1996). Pumpkin seeds are used in the nutraceutical industry because they are rich in proteins, polysaccharide (Teugwa et al., 2013) para -aminobenzoic acid, fixed oils, , polyunsaturated fatty E and pro -vitamin A (zeaxanthin and lutein) and trace elements, such as zinc (Appendino et al., 1999 ; Ryan et al., 2007, Stevenson et al., 2007 ; Glew et al., 2006 ; Adams et al., 2013). 236 One kilogram of pumpkin seed can provide around 450g of oil. The oil is predominantly consist of palmitic acid (C16:0, 9.5 -14.5%), al., 1996 ; Rezig et al., 2012). Oil bodies have previously been isolated from other plant sources (Chen et al., 1998 ; Heneen et al., 2009 ; Iwanaga et al., 2008 ; Murphy and Cummins, 1989 ; Tzen et al., 1992 ; White et al., 2006 ). In this current research we have isolated and characterized pumpkin seed oil bodies (PSO) with respect to their stability as a colloid. In the present work the stability of PSOs were analysed at increasing ionic strength (0 -250mM NaCl) and temperature. The size distribution analysis and zeta potential measurements were carried out using dynamic light scattering. This work involved the extraction and isolation of PSOs using aqueous extraction method. Colloidal solutions of PSOs were characterized for their s tability under increasing temperature and change in ionic strength. 237 7.2 Materials and methods 7.2.1 Materials Dehulled pumpkin seeds, distilled and deionized water from Nano pore water system wa s used for preparation of all solutions, NaOH, Tris -HCl, MgCl 2. 7.2.2 Isolation of Pumpkin seed Oil Bodies The aqueous based flotation centrifugation method was followed with slight modifications as used by Iwanaga 2007. Briefly, homogenization of 100g of dehulled for 2 min at 7000rpm at 370C. This was followed by filtration; centrifugation and the resultant four layers were obtained. The layers were cream, upper curd, lower curd, and supernatant. The four layers were separated and diluted in four separate tubes with equal amount of 10mM Tris. The oil body suspension in 10 mM Tris was then used for further analysis. 238 Figure 7.1: Schematic presentation of th e centrifuge tube after centrifugation. The top most layer was desi gnated as cream, upper curd was the thick layer collected from the upper side wall and lower curd was the pellet settled at the bottom of the tube. Supernatant was the solution in the tube other than these layers . 7.2.3 Optical Microscopy Oil bodies were subjected to microscopic analysis directly after each extraction without making any suspension. The analysis was performed at the magnification of 10X and 40X using the Leintz microscope an d the Pixilink software. Oil bodies were then stored at 40C for further microscopic analysis and examined once per week for four weeks. 7.2.4 Particle size analysis Particle size analysis was performed by diluting the suspension of four layers of oil bodies as mentioned previously (Iwanaga 2007) . Dilution helped to avoid multiple scattering effects. The particle size distribution (PSD) was measured using 239 Beckman Coult er-Delsa Nano C Particle Analyzer. The data was captured using 1730 Back scatter ing angle detector . Dilute solutions were used to minimize non-ideality and also multiple scattering effects (MSE). MSE is induced by the reflection of the laser among the su spended particles and hence can interrupt the results with false reflections. The analysis was performed at an increasing pH (3, 7.4 and 9.0), salt (NaCl) concentration (0, 25, 250mM), and at an increasing temperature. 7.2.5 Zeta Potential analysis As stat ed above s uspensions obtained from the four layers of oil bodies were diluted to a concentration of approximately 0.05wt/% oil using a buffer solution (Iwanaga, 2007 ) in order to avoid multiple scattering effects. Diluted suspensions were injected directly into the measurement chamber of a particle electrophoresis instrument (Beckman Coulter -Delsa Nano C Particle Analyzer). The zeta potential was determined by measuring the direction and velocity of the oil body movement in an applied electrical field. The zeta - potential measurement was reported as the average and standard deviation calculated from mea surement of freshly prepared samples (n=5). Zeta potential measurements were made after the oil body suspensions were stored for 24 h at room temperature. 240 7.2.6 Creaming stability measurements For creaming stability measurements, 10grams of oil body suspe nsion was stored at room temperature in tightly capped containers for 7days. The suspensions were made for cream, upper curd , lower curd and supernatant layers extracted from the PSO. On day 7, different layers were observed. The upper most \"creamy\" laye r separated from the clear serum was observed in all four type suspensions. The l ower curd suspension was separated into three layers, the top most creamy layer, serum in the middle and the bottom layer. The total height of the oil body suspension (H T), the height of the serum layer (H SL), and the height of the cream layer (H CL) were measured. Creaming indices for serum (CI SL=100x H SL/HT) and cream (CI CL=100x H CL/HT) layers were used to calculate creaming stability (Iwanaga, 2007 ). 241 7.3 Results 7.3.1 Microscopic analysis During microscopic analysis, spherical and variable size oil bodies were observed. The oil bodies were intact and in an integrated form at the time of extraction but were found to rupture with time. Light microscopy was used as an immediate and entry level check for the appearance of oil bodies. The o il bodies were spherical for all four layers where cream had larger oil bodies then upper curd. Lower curd and supernatant had considerably smaller size with lower curd densely packed and seemed to be rich in oil bodies than any of the four layers. After 7 days, the large sized oil bodies started to disappear with o nly smaller ones remaining in the cream and upper curd. The lower curd also appeared to be less dense than was observed on day 1 of extraction (Figure 7. 2a-h). Size of smallest PSO was estimated to be less than 2\u00b5m. Oil bodies from other plant sources ha ve the size range of 0.6 -2.0\u00b5m. Based on light microscopy results, it seems that some of the oil bodies had unusually smaller size. Nevertheless, microscopic analysis was performed to see the morphological appearance of PSOs right after extraction . With Light microscopy it was not possible to differentiate among the sizes of the oil bodies where they were compactly packed with each other . Hence, differentiation of size of oil bodies among four layers was not possible. If any staining procedures would have been applied , it would be possible to find out 242 the fatty acid rich regions as mentioned elsewhere in literature (Nantiyakul et al., 2013). Also, it remained inconclusive with light microscopy it could not be detected if some of the PSOs have fused together to form aggregates or the wall between them is still remaining and they are flocculated together to form agglomerate s. Particle size distribution was used to identify the size distribution of oil bodies. 243 Cream : a- T0 at 40 X b-T4 at 40 X Upper curd: c- T0 at 40 X d-T4 at 40 X Lower curd: e- T0 at 40 X f- T4 at 40 X Supernatant: g- T0 at 40 X h-: T4 at 40 X Figure 7 .2 a-h: Microscopic images for all four layers at week 1, time point zero (T0) and week 4, time point 3 (T 3) at 40 X magnification . The scale represents 2\u00b5m 244 7.3.2 Zeta potential analysis Zeta potential measurements were performed at five different temperatures (25, 30, 34, 37 and 400C), three different pH (3, 7.4 and 9.0) and buffer solution 10mM Na2HPO 4.NaCl with the following additional amount of NaCl added (0, 10, 25, 50,100 and 250mM). 7.3.2.1 Zeta potential () measurements at increasing salt concentration and varying pH At pH 3, the zeta potential values remain positive but as the salt concentration increase this positive value gradually decreases when the diffe rent layers of the oil bodies are exposed to increasing salt concentrations. In the absence of salt, the zeta potential is approximately +30mV, but as the salt concentration increases, the potential rises at 10mM but then decreases over the salt range (F igure 1a). This trend continues for the upper curd, lower curd and the supernatant and the degree of the reduction (mV) in zeta potential is of the order cream< upper curd<lower curd<supernatant at pH 3 (Figure 5 -a, b). At pH 7.4, physiological pH, the chan ges in salt concentration from 10 -250mM reduce the zeta potential significantly (Figure 2.2) across all layers such that increased salt concentrations induce negative potentials. Increasing the salt concentrations still further, however, does not make the potential more negative. However, at pH 9 the zeta potential falls from 0mV - 245 50mV as the salt concentration increases with the largest reduction shown with 100mM salt (Figure 2.3). In all cases, the measurements were positive in the absence of NaCl t hat transformed into negative values with NaCl. These results are in accordance to the previously established behaviour of pumpkin seed oil bodies (Adams et al., 2012 ). This drop could possibly be due to the decreasing thickness of electrical double layer around the suspended particle in the sodium chloride rich buffer (Salgn et al., 2012 ). Moreover, this behaviour was observed by Salgin et al. while examining protein solution with a range of chloride salts (Salgn et al., 2012 ). There is a high possibility that the method adapted to extract oil bodies allowed intact oil body along with attached proteins that is the structure of the oil bodies are preserved (Demetriades et al., 1997 ). Thus, as the pH increases there is a general decrease in the zeta potential with the point of zero charge being around pH 3-3.5, which is lower than seen in most other plant (Chen et al., 2004 ). However, The isoelectric point (PI) of 5.4 for c ream (at 25 and 250mM NaCl), Upper curd and supernatant (at 25mM NaCl) is related to the previously extracted oil bodies from other plant sources (Chuang et al., 1996 , Tzen et al., 1993 ). This behaviour is consistent with protein -stabilized lipid droplets (Guzey and McClements, 2007 ) and suggests that the Oleosin protein coating remained around the oil bodies' post -aqueous extraction method. The lower isoelectric point of the lipid b odies in this study could be 9 due to the formation of 246 surface active lipids, which are negatively charged. If some of the proteins associated with the lipid bodies were enzymes that could degrade lipid this could potentially happen. For example, soybeans phospholipases can hydrolyze the functional groups of phospholipids (Abousalham et al., 1995 ), which could result in the conversion of phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidic acid. As a result, there is an increase in the negative charge. Moreover, soybeans contain lipases that could hydrolyze lipids producing free fatty ac ids, which could migrate to the interface of the oil bodies altering the isoelectric point. Nevertheless, further work is required to establish the potential role of enzyme activity on the surface charge properties of oil bodies extracted from pumpkins. 7.3.2.2 Zeta potential () measurements at increasing temperature If oil bodies are to be used in physiological therapies/treatments, it is essential that we examine the influence of temperature ranges on the stability of the oil body suspensions. At pH 3, the effect of increasing the temperature with regards to the cream, showed a positive zeta potential which gradually decreased with highly positive -potential for cream to almost zero -potential for supernatant ( Figure 7. 3a to 7.3d). 247 However, at pH 7.4 and pH 9 and with increasing temperature the zeta potential reduced such that, across all four layers, cream, upper and lower curds and the supernatant, a negative zeta potential was obtained. 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 4220253035404550 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42-80-60-40-20020406080 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42-80-60-40-20020Cream zeta potential at pH 3.0 (mV) Temperature (0C) Cream zeta potential at pH 7.4 (mV) Temperature (0C) 0 mM NaCl 10 mm NaCl 25 mM NaCl 50 mM NaCl 100 mM NaCl 250 mM NaClCream Zeta potential at pH 9.0 (mV) Temperature (0C) Figure 7. 3a: Zeta potential measurement for cream at an increasing pH, temperature and salt concentration 248 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42-1001020304050 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42-80-60-40-200204060 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42-60-40-20020Upper curd zeta potential at pH 3.0 (mV) Temperature (0C) Upper curd zeta potential at pH 7.4 (mV) Temperature (0C) 0 mM NaCl 10 mM NaCl 25 mM NaCl 50 mM NaCl 100 mM NaCl 250 mM NaClUpper curd zeta potential at pH 9.0 (mV) Temperature (0C) Figure 7. 3b: Zeta potential measurement for upper curd at an increasing pH, temperature and salt concentration 249 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42-14-7071421 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42-70-60-50-40-30-20-10010203040506070 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42-60-50-40-30-20-1001020 0 mM NaCl 10 mM NaCl 25 mM NaCl 50 mM NaCl 100 mM NaCl 250 mM NaClLower curd zeta potential at pH 3.0 (mV) Temperature (0C) Lower curd zeta potential at pH 7.4 (mV) Temperature (0C) Lower curd zeta potential at pH 9.0 (mV) Temperature (0C) Figure 7.3c: Zeta potential measurement for lower curd at an increasing pH, temperature and salt concentration 250 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42-20-1001020 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42-45-30-15015304560 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42-75-60-45-30-15015Supernatant Zeta potential at pH 3.0 (mV) Temperature (0C) Supernatant Zeta potential at pH 7.4 (mV) Temperature (0C) 0 mM NaCl 10 mM NaCl 25 mM NaCl 50 mM NaCl 100 mM NaCl 250 mM NaClSupernatant Zeta potential at pH 9.0 (mV) Temperature (0C) Figure7. 3d: Zeta potential measurement for supernatant at an increasing pH, temperature and salt concentration Oil body suspensions were held at temperatures ranging from 25 to 40\u00b0C for 30 minutes prior to analysis of zeta potential, mean particle diameter, and creaming stability. The thermal stability of oil bodies has previously been demonstrated for 251 both natural and artificial oil bodies from various plant sources (Chiang et al., 2005b ) but not for pumpkin. This thermal stability suggests that heating does not cause a significant increase in the surface hydrophobicity (water repelling property) of the oil bodies at lower temperatures, as occurs in globular protein -stabilized lipid droplets (Kim et al., 2005 ). Oleosin proteins are purported to have a \"T\" -structure, with a hydrophilic head (the horizontal top part of the T) and a hydrophobic tail (the vertical part of the T). The hydrophilic head is exposed to water and believed to lie flat against the phospholipid -water interface that surrounds the oil bodies; the hydrop hobic tail penetrates through the phospholipid layer and into the triacylglycerol core of the oil bodies (Chen and Ono, 2010 ). On exposure to certain temperatures, this hydroph obic tail remains in its highly non - polar environment and is not exposed to water. However, at 37\u00b0C in the cream and the lower curd layers significance is seen ( Figure 7.5a &c) and it may be due to the exposure of the tail to local water environment. 252 7.3.3 Particle size distribution Measurement of particle size distribution can be helpful in identification of any structural changes in the particles that occur due to environmental changes (environment refers to the solution or suspension in which the molecule s are suspended. According to the Stokes Einstein equation the size (radius) of the particle is affected by other parameters such as diffusion and visc osity. Hence, the measurement of size distribution in the various suspensions is a useful way of detecting any variations. OBs size distribution was measured by making an emulsion of varying pH (3.0, 7.4, and 9.0), temperature (25, 30, 34, 37, 400C) and salt concentration (0, 10, 25, 50, 100 and 250 mM) of buffer with extracted oil bodies across the fou r layers. These conditions affect the aggregation properties of the particles and hence the size. Under the given environmental circumstances the changes thus observed in aggregation properties were recorded as the structural changes adapted by OBs. Aggre gation properties in fact reflect the stability of an emulsion . In general, creaming occurs due to the separation of dispersed phase from an emulsion. During this process, for example in water in oil emulsion, floating of oil droplets (lower density lipoprotein) on the surface of emulsion occurs resulting in the formation of a thick layer on the surface. Slight creaming is unavoidable , even in stable emulsio n. However , it is a reversible process . Aggre gation occurs when droplets clustered together to form large flocs but the surface boundary of the droplets remains intact. 253 This process can't be reversed by agitation. If the boundary is ruptured then the resulted cluster is termed as a coalescence The size difference betwe en droplet size of a cream and larger aggregates is variable and depends upon the physicochemical composition of the droplets and the surrounding solution (Iyons and Carter, 1997; Jean tet et al., 2016) . Changes in PSD of PSO due to aggregation in the presence/ absence of salt, change in pH and temperature are discussed in the following s ection s (section 7.3.3.1 and 7.3.3.2) . 7.3.3.1 Particle size distribution at increasing pH salt concentration As can be seen by Figure 7. 4, the lowest average size distributions are seen at pH 7.4 across all four layers especially within the cream and upper curd layers. At pH 3 and 9, the highest average size distributions are seen in the lower curd and cream layers. At pH 7.4, the oil bodies show little variation in the particle size with ranges from ~200 -400nm. Relative insensitivity of the zeta potential of oil bodies to the addition of salt may be due to the presence of some endogenous salt in the system or charge regulation effects. The addition of monovalent cations (Na+) may, for example, partially displace any divalent cations (Mg2+ or Ca2+) associated with the anionic oil body surface at neutral pH. This would counterbalance the expected decrease in negative charge. 254 At pH 3 and 9, however, there are 3 -4 fold increases in the size for pH 3 and 9, respectively. Table 7.1 indicates the size d istribution of oil bodies at an increasing pH with temperature and salt concentration Table 7.1 : Average particle size with increasing pH, temperature and salt concentration z-average diameter (nm) pH Cream Upper curd Lower curd Supernatant 3 1200 500 840 530 7.4 370 290 660 290 9 930 450 1140 770 These results indicate that at pH 3 and pH 9, the average particle size distribution increases across all layers with increasing salt concentration (0 -250mM). Although these results suggest that the oil bodies have relatively poor resistance to aggregation in the presence of salt and the explanation for this phenomenon could be the ability of salt to screen the electrostatic repulsion between the oil bodies (Iwanaga, 2008 ), the fact that we can pattern the size of the oil bodies is more important in terms of physiological therapeutics. 255 .

The trend indicates that, as temperature i ncrease the average size distribution increases up to 37\u00b0C with the greatest significant increase seen in the lower curd and at 30\u00b0C. At 25\u00b0C, the size (nm) order was Lower curd> Cream> supernatant> upper curd. A similar trend was seen in the average siz e distribution with increasing temperature up to 37\u00b0C (Figure 7.5). An increase in temperature to 40\u00b0C causes a reduction in size as seen in table 7.2. 257 Table 7.2: Average size distribution with increasing temperature across four layers Average particle size (z-average) with increasing temperature Temperature (0C) cream (nm) Upper curd (nm) Lower curd (nm) Supernatant (nm) 25 640 340 712 488 30 880 390 834 515 34 740 407 56 542 37 1080 452 1356 543 40 814 480 748 563 258 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 4201500300045006000 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 420100200300400500600700800 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 0mMNaCl 10mMNaCl 25mMNaCl Cream size distribution (nm), pH7.4 Temperature (0C) Cream size distribution (nm), pH 9.0 Temperature (0C) Figure 7. 6a: Size distribution measurement for cream at an increasing pH, temperature and salt concentration 259 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 4205001000150020002500 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 420100200300400500600700800 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 420600120018002400Upper curd size distribution (nm), pH 9.0 Temperature (0C) Figure 7. 6b: Size distribution measurement for upper curd at an increasing pH, temperature and salt concentration 260 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 4202000400060008000100001200014000 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42050010001500200025003000 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42050001000015000200002500030000Lowercurd size distribution (nm), pH 3.0 Temperature (0C) Figure 7. 6c: Size distribution measurement for lower curd at an increasing pH, temperature and salt concentration 261 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42200400600800100012001400160018002000 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 420250500750 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 420500100015002000250030003500Supernatant size distribution (nm), pH 3.0 Temperature Figure 7. 6d: Size distribution for supernatant at increasing temperature, pH and salt concentration 262 7.3.4: Comparison of PSD and optical microscopy For optical microscopy of cream oil bodies at T0, a mixture of compactly packed aggregates and droplets was observed. The size for largest aggregate was more than 2 \u00b5m and the most of the oil bodies appeared to be smaller than 2 \u00b5m. After 4 weeks (T4) , the smaller droplets disappeared. Upper curd and lower curd also had the same size range for aggregates and droplets at T0 except they were less compact compared to the oil bodies from cream. However, at T4 only clumps could be seen which indicates clear reduction in the stability. Particle size distribution analysis predict a size range between <0.5 \u00b5m to > 2 \u00b5m. PSO at pH 7.0 had the lowest size distribution range < 1.0 \u00b5m. However, variation in pH (pH 3.0 and 9.0) resulted in an increase in overall size distribution indicating formation of aggregates . The size obtained for PSOs are in the same range for oil bodies from other species that is rape seed, mustard, cotton, flax maize, sesame (Tzen et al., 1993; Nantiyakul et al., 2013) Optical microscopy and PSD are two alternative approaches to look at the size distribution . Nevertheless , during this study optical microscopy was used to get an initial idea of morphological appearance of PSO after extraction until week 4 without any further washing and t he colloidal solution s of PSOs were not subjected to variation in pH, salt or temperature and was stored at 40C. Nonetheless , it will be useful for further studies to compare two methods in similar conditions. 263 7.3.5 Stability measurements Structural integrity and stability of oil body in a particular system or environment is an important and desirable quality. For example, role of oil body as an emulsifying agent is an anticipated virtue in industries for a wide variety of products ranging from vaccines, food cosmetics, and personal care products (Bhatla, 2010 ; Vanrooijen, 1995 ). Stability measurements allowed an understanding of the extent of particle aggregation in different salt (NaCl) concentration. Creaming is a normal process in which aggregation of particles takes place and t hey rise or sediment at the surface or bottom of the suspension based on their density. In creaming the particles still possess their protective coating or the membrane and do not collapse as seen in coalescence. The aggregation can be induce or reduce dep ending on the environment (for example, presence of electrolytes). Creaming index represents the percentage of separation of oil layer (creaming) from the from oil body suspensions. The higher creaming index indicates higher particle aggregation (Iwanaga, 2007 ), which in turns means lower stability of the suspension. The supernatant did not show any sign of creaming at all possible due to they were more stable to the provided conditions. Lower curd had the minimum stability with the lowest salt concentration. Additionally, upper curd showed lowest stability at 100mM salt concentration. If an account of error bars is also ta ken then statistically, there was no significant difference with respect to changing salt 264 concentration in the stability of oil bodies from cream, upper curd and lower curd (Figure 7. 7). 01234567891011121314 10 25 50 100 250Creaming index % Buffer Concentration (mM) Cream Upper curd Lower curd Supernatant Figure 7. 7: The creaming stability of the four layers with increasing NaCl concentration in the suspending buffer. This insensitivity could possibly be due to their stability and resistance to aggregation in the given salt concentrations at room temperature . These results are in contrast to the PSD where an increase in temperature, salt and pH resulted in an increase in size distribution of oil bodies which is a clear indication of aggregation. Thus creaming and aggregation properties are very sensitive to change in environmental conditions. 265 For future work it will be useful to observe creaming indexes at a range of temperature to understand effect of temperature change on oil bodies aggregation properties in depth. 266 7.4 Conclusion In the current chapter extraction, isolation and characterisation of oil bodies from pumpkin seeds has been carried out. Oil bodies from other plants seeds have been extracted earlier but po tential of pumpkin seed oil bodies has still not been explored. This study incl uded isolation of oil bodies from 4 different positions (cream, upper curd, lower curd and supernatant) in centrifuge tube during extraction . This means these oil bodies had different densities despite the fact they are all extracted from the same seeds. Difference in densities could be related to variation in their composition, most probably composition of the attached proteins or lipid s. Nevertheless , further structural analysis is required in order to draw conclusion about the composition of PSOs from the four layers. In this work, the structural behaviour of pumpkin seed oil bodies with respect to the variation in the nature of the suspension has been established. The colloidal solution of oil bodies (oil bodies in the specific buffer with variable sal t concentration) itself present a naturally stabilized molecule. Characterisation of this colloid by changing pH and temperature provides us an array of environmental conditions to test structural stability of PSO . During this study, environmental friendly approach that i s aqueous extraction was adapted to extract pumpkin seed oil bodies. Furthermore, after isolation these oil bodies form physically and chemically stable emulsion. 267 Microscopic analysis revealed that freshly extracted oil bodies ( at time point zero ) were spherical and present as compactly packed but as an intact unit for all four layers except that supernatant did not have too many oil bodies. At week 4, most of the PSOs had form clumps which shows reduction in stability after a limited period of time. Although microscopy was only used to have an initial check for appearance of oil bodies after isolation and PSD was used to measure the size dis tribution of PSOs. Both methods were in close agreement in predicting the size of PSOs. The average size of PSOs was between 0.5 to 2.0\u00b5m, which lies in the average size range of oil bodies from other plant seeds (Tzen et al., 1993). Knowledge of zeta potential is also the key point for characterisation of electrochemical surface properties. Alteration in any of these parameters of the solvent altogether changes the behaviour of PSO. During this study, isoelectric point (PI) for most of the PSOs was bet ween 3 -3.5. This PI is lower than a range of oil bodies mentioned previously (PI= 5.7 -6.6) ( Tzen et al., 1993). However, this PI was closed to the Ozyra oil bodies PI=4 (Nantiyakul et al., 2013). PSOs from cream (at 25 and 250mM NaCl) and supernatant at 25 mM Na Cl, had PI= 5.4 which indicates presence of oleosin proteins even after extraction (Payne et al., 2014) and also explain the reason of less aggregation and smaller PSD for PSOs from cream. Size distribution analysis and microscopy give an idea about s ize and aggregation properties of oil bodies. Aggregation behaviour is subjected to pH, salt concentration 268 and temperature of the buffer. Therefore, during this study a variation in size distribution was observed when subjected to changing conditions The purpose behind extracting oil bod ies from pumpkin seed is to provide an alternative source for lipid droplet that could be used in its natural form (protected by its proteins and phospholipid layer) for multiple industrial application. This could involve their role as a natural emulsifier for formulations, cosmetics products and hydrophobic drugs, adjuvants for vaccines, encapsulation for prebiotics, and purification for recombinant proteins (Bhatla et al., 2010 ; Laibach et al., 2014 ; Roberts et al., 2008 ; Van Rooijen and Motoney, 1995 ; Deckers et al., 2004 ). These results could be helpful to recognize the structure and behaviour of oil bodies from pumpkin seeds in conditions closely related to natural physiological environment in order to explore the potential of these substances (protein and oils) as colloids in biopharmaceutical industry. For commercial purposes, enhancement of oil -body stability tends to reduce processing cost by attenuating the degradation of oil bodies and may also promote the development of novel applications. However, before any further application of these oil bodies it is crucial to identify their behaviour further in an alternative system and to find out the lipid and protein composition of PSOs. For future studies, measurement of isoelectric point using streaming potential and turbidity test will allow to compare current data with an alternative method. Furthermore, it will be beneficial to understand the behaviour of 269 role of PSOs by using an in vitro digest ive model in order to understand its physiological behaviour in humans. 270 Chapter 8: Conclusion and prospective work This thesis comprises of the study on isolation and structural characterisation of polysaccharides from three cucurbits ( C. maxima, C. moschata and C. pepo ) and pumpkin seed oil bodies. These plants were selected based on their pharmacological importance in relation to diabetes. The c omponents from cucurbits (polysaccharides, proteins and other phytochemicals) possess a wide spectrum for biological application s. The hydrodynamical characterisation and structural parameters meas ured in this study for the above mentioned bio -materials have never b een reported in literature before . 8.1 Extraction, hydrodynamic and structural characterisation of Cucurbit polysaccharides Establishment of identical isolation and fractionation conditions was the first challenge for this study. All polysaccharides were extracted using aqueous extraction method from the pulp of each squash. These polysaccharides were extracted from plant material in the form of a complex where some non- polysaccharide material was also detected in addition to polysaccharides. In plant cell wall , the polysaccharides are not presen t in an isolated form instead they exist 271 as a complex structure where they are associated with other polysaccharides (for example, pectin is associated with cellulose in plant cell wall) and proteins. Therefore, it is possible that these complex structures were also extracted along with the desired polysaccharide as a conjugate. Hence, p urification step was necessary in order to isolate the polysaccharides. The s evage reagent which is chloroform -butanol mix was used for this purpose in an amount considered safe for human consumption. In an attempt to reduce the amount of impurities and unwanted non -polysaccharide substances attached to the sample of interest, gel chromatography was used to fractionate the isolated polysaccharides from three cucurbits . A number of fractions were collected at the end of chromatography for polysaccharides from each cucurbit. Identical environmental conditions were applied to analyse all cucurbit polysaccharides before and after fractionation. During this stud y 0.1M Phosphate buffer saline at pH 7.0 , was used for hydrodynamical analysis because its composition is closed to the physiological environment. At the time of writing, none of the polysaccharides used in this study have been hydrodynamically characteri sed before . Hydrodynamic characterisation included measurement of weight average sedimentation coefficient, weight average molecular weight, intrinsic viscosity and diffusion coefficient. 272 A comparison of the se three polysaccharides revealed that they shar e few similar characteristics and some differences as well in their hydrodynamic properties. For an analysis of sedimentation properties using analytical ultracentrifuge, in addition to interference optics, absorbance optics and wave length scans were use d to analyse the presence of proteins and chromophores before and after purification and fractionation. All polysaccharides samples were highly polydispersed and a number of species were detected in all of them during sedimentation distribution analysis. Presence of protein was detected before purification with sevage reagent in the samples under investigation from the three cucurbits. Polysaccharide from C. moschata had no absorbance after purification and hence had protein or chromophores successfully removed. C. maxima and C. pepo extracted samples were golden brown in colour where C. pepo fractions were the darkest. In case of C. maxima, insignificant absorbance w as observed after purification using absorbance optics. This could be presence of the coloured compounds. C. pepo had very high absorbance over the range of wavelength. Therefore, based on the wave length scans it was concluded that there were some chromop hores and tightly bound proteins present associated with C. pepo polysaccharides even after purification . In unfractionated polysaccharide s, the weight average sedimentation coefficient for the major species (species with the highest weight percentage) in creased in the following order C. moschata < C. maxima < C. pepo . This change in weight average 273 sedimentation coefficient reflected the differences in their structural properties and their behaviour. However, these values were not significantly different from each other. The weight average sedimentation coefficient values obtained in this study for unfractionated polysaccharides are in the range of the values mentioned in literature for polysaccharide with similar monosaccharide composition (galactouronic acid rich - pectin like polysaccharides ) but different origin (Morris et al., 2008 ; Morris et al., 2000; Morris et al., 2014). Sedimentation properties along with viscosity and molecular weight for unfractionated polysaccharides from the three species wer e close to each other except that the molecular weight of C. maxima was significantly higher than the other two unfractionated cucurbit polysaccharides . This simila rity in data could be due to some structural or conformational resemblance in the three unfractionated polysaccharides. After fractionation , in all three polysaccharides there was a general decrease in sedimentation coefficient values and hence the polydispersity. However, for C. pepo polydispers ity remained high des pite fractionation. This shows the variation in C. pepo structure from the other two polysaccharide. The number of prominent and stable species detected in all fractions was variable (2 to 3) in all fractions of the three polysaccharides. Over all, there w as a shift in sedimentation coefficient values towards right upon fractionation that is sedimentation coefficient increased upon fractionation. 274 All fractions of the three polysaccharides followed the same trend for viscosity and molecular weight measurements. It was observed that both quantities were directly proportional to each other . Furthermore, 1st fraction for all polysaccharides had the highest values for molecular weight compared to the other fractions and unfractionated polysaccharide. This indicates an increase in polydispersity due to conformational changes which decreased gradually in later fractions . Also, there was a big drop in the valu es of intrinsic viscosity after fractio nation for all polysaccharides . Intrinsic viscosity depends upon the molecular weight and conformation of a polymer . Thus , if molecular weight and viscosity of a polysaccharide have changed there is a clear indication of conformational changes post fractionation. There was an exception to this case where viscosity of C. pepo fractions could not be calculated due to the high rate of deterio ration of the sample. Additionally, in C. moschata some self -association in fractionated polysaccharide was also detected. However, the strength of self -association was weak as compared to the one reported in lite rature for other self -associating polysac charides . It is possible that due to fractionation, certain conformational changes induced this week association in C. moschata polysaccharide which was not detected or did not take place in the other two polysaccharides after fractionation. Contrary to the results from AUC and viscosity, large particles or aggregates were detected using dynamic light scattering for three polysaccharides (unfractionated and fractionated) . The only reason behind this could be, due to high speed in AUC 275 during sedimentation velocity these large aggregates sediment quickly and these undissolved particles do not impose any impact on viscosity. In order to understand the structural variations of these polysaccharides that belong to the same family but different species, monosac charide composition was also determined. The quantitative evaluation suggests that these polysaccharides were rich in galactouronic acid with higher amount of galactose, arabinose and xylose and the compositions reflects them to be hetero -galactouronans an d galacto - arabinans which is the characteristic of pectin like sugars. However, due to lack of information about the molar percentage of linkages among the monosaccharide units, it was not possible to predict exact nature of these pectin like complex sugar s. Moreover, these polysaccharides were also tested for their Immunostimulating properties. Bioactivity of cucurbit polysaccharides ha s never been investigated before (at the time of writing). All extracted polysaccharides were found to be biologically a ctive with variable bioactivity. However, the ICH 50 values (the concentration required to induce 50% cell lysis) for the high molecular weight compounds came out to be low. This means the higher molecular weight compounds were more bioactive as compared to the lower molecular weight compounds. Additionally, the higher molecular weight fractions in all cucurbit s had the highest amount of galactouronic acid. Moreover, C. pepo fractions were the most active followed by C. maxima and C. moschata. The reason behind the association of bioactivity with molecular weight is not clearly known but it could be galactouronic acid in these high molecular weight compounds that played the role in their 276 bioactivity. Literature has reported association of immuno -stimu lating properties with galactouronic acid rich region of polysaccharides . Also, both fractions of C. pepo contained arabinose in large quantity and that could be linked to its highest bioactivity amongst all polysaccharide fractions. Furthermore, this study does not include information about the linkages of the fractionated polysaccharide which could have provide d more evidence about the relationship of bioactivity to the conformation and structure of the polysaccharide s. 8.1.1 Future work suggestions for Cucurbit polysaccharides Hydrodynamic properties have high significance in order to predict solution structure and interaction of any isolated biomolecule or complex. During this study, identification of sedimentation properties, molecular behaviour and viscosity of the complex polysaccharides from three species of Cucurbitaceae family provides initial information but this information collectively can be helpful to predict the behaviour of these biomolecule in future. For example, s elf-assoc iation may have application in drug delivery especially in the form of nano -gels and micelles. Indeed, the phenomenon of self -association has been used to create nano -gels to create nano - carriers using modified pullulan to develop intranasal vaccines again st cancer . Therefore self -association in C. moschata polysaccharide could be an interesting new area for future investigation. 277 Polysaccharides conformation and interactions are influenced by environmental conditions. In solution, any change in temperature, pH or salt concentration and choice of salt used in buffer can alter their properties completely. For example, gelling properties of pectin depend upon degree of methylation, conformation, degree of esterification and presence of calcium ions in the solut ion and pectin can form gel or stay in solution form depending on the combination of conditions used to prepare the solvation buffer. During this study, only one set of conditions (0.M PBS, pH 7.0, 200C) was used to analyse cucurbit polysaccharides behaviour. Considering the pectin like nature of the extracted polysaccharide, it will be beneficial to analyse these polysaccharides at a range of pH, temperature and molar concentration s. It will also be significant to consider completely different buffe r for instance TRIS. Change of buffer will possibly help to understand the hydrodynamic behaviour deeply. It is expected to reveal other unknown details of these three cucurbit polysaccharides. Additionally, interactive studies would also be useful where the cucurbit polysaccharides' interaction with other compounds can be evaluated in order to identify their potential in drug delivery. This study does not cover the conformational aspect of these polysaccharides. Nevertheless, for future studies it will be significant to analyse conformational parameters using HYDFIT or COVOL and apply other methods like circular dichroism (CD), small angle X -ray scattering (SAXS), nuclear magnetic resonance 278 NMR and size exclusion chromatography - multi angle light spectroph otometry (SEC -MALS) to analyse the structure along with conformation. For further investigations , pharmaceutical potential for cucurbit polysacchari des can be explored. Identification of cucurbit polysaccharide s as an immun omodulator could be one step for ward to evaluate their medicinal properties. For instance, bioactive polysaccharides can facilitate mucoadhesion, enhanced targeting of specific tissues and reduction in inflammatory response . Use of Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay to identify the induct ion of cytokine secretion to further conform their stimulatory properties to activate leukocytes. Previous studies have tested hypoglycaemic potential of the whole cucurbit powder or otherwise for the intact polysaccharides. It will be significant to test the effect of fractionated polysaccharides in vivo using animal model or in vitro using cell culturing methods. This will allow to identify the active component responsible to induce not only hypoglycaemic effect but other health inducing properties that i ncludes, hypocholesterolaemia and anti -cancerous effect. Lastly, human feeding trial studies to find out the medicinal effect in human bodies will be beneficial. The hypoglycaemic activity of extracted cucurbit biomaterials has been investigated previously in rats . Consumption of a well characterised extracted moiety as compare d to the whole fruit will provide more specific information about the function of these biomaterials . These may be important future further steps building on this current study to understand the relationship between the structure and function of these important materials. Although , identification of toxicity and 279 determination of right amount of required dose is also a crucial step before any extract is allowed to be used for human feeding trials. 8.2 Pumpkin seed oil bodies (PSO) This study also includes extraction, isolation and characterisation of pumpkin seed oil bodies (PSOs). Extraction was performed in an environmental friendly way and no hazardou s chemicals were used during extraction. Furthermore, PSOs were isolated from different layers formed in centrifuge tube. This indicates that all these oil bodies had different densities which indicates variation in structural composition. Thus the PSOs ex perimentation included 4 types of oil body suspensions. These suspensions were subjected to various environmental conditions or stress . This include change in pH, temperature and salt concen tration. Microscopic analysis, particle size distribution (PSD) an d zeta potential () analysis were performed in order to elucidate the stability and aggregation properties of PSOs in the given set of conditions. Average size of PSOs was in the range of 0.5 to 2.0\u00b5m as ca lculated through PSD which lies in the average size range of oil bodies from other plant seeds . Effect of changes in temperature and pH at various salt concentrations showed variation s in isoelectric point. Isoelectric point of most of the PSOs (in acidic and basic environment) was lower than the one r eported in literature ( For example, soy (Iwanaga et al., 2007), Maize germ and sun flower seed (Nikiforidisa et al., 2013), 280 Oryza sativa (Nantiyakul et al., 2013), Echium plantagineum (Payne et 2014), sun flower ( Makkhun et al., 2015) almonds and wall nuts (Ga llier and Singh, 2012; Gallier et al., 2013) . For most of the conditions it was in the range of 3 to 3.5 and raised up to 5.4 for cream oil bodies at 25 and 250mM NaCl. Such isoelectric point is associated with protein bound oil droplets. Furthermo re, any variation in this behaviour could be due to the isolation of associated enzymes that could degrade surface active lipids and bring change in the isoelectric potential. PSOs from cream had the smallest size distribution in all conditions which show s that these oil bodies were more stable and had more resistant to aggregation in the conditions provided as compared to the PSOs from all other layers . However, at 370C temperatures, cream and lower curd oil bodies appeared to form large aggregates which could again be due to the sensitivity of attached proteins to this temperature. Overall these PSOs from all layers showed gradual increase in size distribution (PSD) with an increase in pH and salt concentration. With respect to changes in temperature all oil bodies showed insignificant variation except that at 370C. This shows t hat oil bodies from pumpkins have better r esistant to aggregation with respect to change in temperature. This study not only provides information about the suitable extraction co nditions and appearance for an alternative lipid droplet but also provides valuable information about the stability of colloidal solutions of PSO under a system subjected to 281 variations. The preliminary structural information about the PSO s obtained during this investigation can pave way for these oil bodies to serve as an alternative sou rce for lipid droplet that can be used on its own that is in its natural form (protected by its proteins and phospholipid layer) for multiple industrial applications. From commercial prospective establishment of these conditions to understand the stability of oil -body can reduce processing cost. This can also help to identify and eliminate the conditions responsible for degradation of oil bodies and may also promote the deve lopment of novel applications. 8.2.1 Future work suggestions for Pumpkin seed oil bodies Extraction and characterisation of oil bodies from pumpkin seeds provides initial information about these oil droplets under specific system only. It is possible that changing the system could affect the behaviour of PSOs. PSOs can be extracted using other buffers to provide a completely different system of extraction such as use of sucrose -KCl-MgCl 2 buffer as used for extraction of oil bodies from maize (Tzen et al., 1992) Identification of Composition of lipid and the fatty acid content could have helped more to understand PSOs in depth. Furthermore, associated proteins could possibly have role in the structural integrity and have an influence on size distribution and zeta potential of PSOs. It will be beneficial to analyse the nature of associated proteins with PSO in order to exploit the structure for further application s. 282 Similar conditions can be considered for microscopic and PSD analysis to reflect true changes in size distribution. Use of confocal microscopy in addition to the light microscopy will provide more insight about morphology of PSOs. Further studies can also include structural modification and association of PSOs with other polymers. If PSOs to be u sed in drug delivery it will be beneficial to use an in vitro model for human digestive system to mimic the physiological conditions. This will provide more insight about potential role of PSOs in the respective field. Nevertheless, for future studies furt her investigation related to the stability of pumpkin seed oil bodies will be required. The stability of oil bodies is an essential factor for their use in health care and pharmaceutical industries. It will be significant to consider coating of pumpkin oil bodies with polysaccharides to provide stability. Previous studies have shown that the pectin polysaccharides are reported to provide stability to the protein coated lipid. Considering the pectin like nature of the cucurbit polysaccharide extracted during this study, it will be promising and an advantage to prepare a formulation of PSO stabilised by coating of these polysaccharides. Furthermore, i nvestigation of oil bodies from seeds of other species could identify interspecies structural differences and could provide an alternative source of oil droplets . Besides, oil bodies and polysaccharides, cucurbits also contain other compounds such as Trigonelline and nicotinic acid. These phytochemical have also been 283 reported to have role in medicinal properties o f cucurbits. Role of these compounds should also be explored in order to completely understand the health inducing effect of these members of cucurbit family. It will also be interesting to identify the composition of the associated proteins and chromophor es in future. 8.3 Concluding remarks The selected family and the species in particular were chosen based on their history of an tidiabetic potential. Diabetes M ellitus is a worldwide growing health problem. Despite of a number of treatments available, the problem still persists and the number of people with diabetes is increasing every year. Naturally extracte d compounds has application in nutraceutical, medicin al and food industry. The results presented in this study could act as a stepping stone or a pilot work that could reduce the cost of characterization for any novel application in future which will not be limited to diabetes treatment. Detailed knowledge of the chemical nature, aggregation, interaction and structural variation in a particul ar environment of a biomaterial can be helpful in describing their potential behaviour and use in therapeutics for drug development or otherwise their use as a nutraceut ical compound. For processing of any polymer into a desired formu lation, to get the desired shape , to be used as an adjuvant or carries, understanding of its building block and peculiar structure is vital. Furthermore, information about solution 284 propertie s provides the basis for d erivative chemistry, structure -chemistry relationships and the potential for regioselective modifications. The extracted biomaterials (polysaccharides and oil bodies) can serve as an alternative and natural source for industrial u se for example in drug delivery or as an excipient for the development of an alternative treatment of diabetes . 285 References ABOUSALHAM, A.
