Its cause is unknown and symptoms tend to wax and wane over time. Psoriasis falls under the [Skin, Hair, & Nails](/categories/skin-hair-nails/)and [Autoimmune Disease](/categories/autoimmune-disease/)categories. Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease where skin cells regenerate too quickly and form thick, red patches of skin with white or silver scales. [[1]](/conditions/psoriasis/#ref-1) A 2017 study found that up to 11% of adults and 1.4% of children worldwide have psoriasis. [[2]](/conditions/psoriasis/#ref-2) Psoriasis typically looks like elevated lesions that are red, dry, and have silvery scales. They can appear anywhere on the body, such as: [[1]](/conditions/psoriasis/#ref-1) - Elbows - Knees - Scalp - Face - Palms - Feet The diagnosis is largely clinical, based on the appearance of the rash and associated symptoms. A healthcare professional must first rule out other diseases that may cause similar symptoms. During a visit with a healthcare professional, a clinical history is acquired and a comprehensive skin evaluation is done. [[3]](/conditions/psoriasis/#ref-3) Treatment is determined by the extent and severity of symptoms. Medical treatments include: - Topical creams (e.g. steroids and moisturizers) - Oral or injected medications (e.g. immunosuppressants) - Phototherapy (exposing skin to different wavelengths of light) Topical treatments are used for milder cases. If there is no response to topical treatments or for more severe cases, immunosuppressants and/or phototherapy (a treatment that uses ultraviolet light) may be used. [[3]](/conditions/psoriasis/#ref-3) Dietary supplements are often sought out to relieve symptoms of psoriasis. Supplements with the most evidence include: Some studies show that the above supplements are either beneficial or ineffective. More rigorous research is needed before recommendations can be made. [[4]](/conditions/psoriasis/#ref-4) Observational studies have demonstrated that people with psoriasis consume a lower amount of foods typically found in a [Mediterranean diet](/diets/mediterranean-diet/) (e.g., [olive oil](/foods/olive-oil/), fruits, [fish](/foods/fish/), [nuts](/foods/nuts/), and whole grains). [[5]](/conditions/psoriasis/#ref-5) [[6]](/conditions/psoriasis/#ref-6) Research using dietary interventions found that a hypocaloric diet in [overweight](/conditions/overweight/) or obese people with psoriasis or a [gluten-free diet](/foods/gluten-free-diet/) in people with a gluten sensitivity shows the most promise for helping reduce symptoms of psoriasis. [[7]](/conditions/psoriasis/#ref-7) It is recommended that changes in diet should be used alongside standard medical treatments. [[7]](/conditions/psoriasis/#ref-7) There is some weak evidence that saltwater baths combined with phototherapy is effective. However, these findings are inconclusive and further research is required. [[8]](/conditions/psoriasis/#ref-8) There are also some small studies suggesting that [meditation](/other/meditation/) can help alleviate some symptoms. [[9]](/conditions/psoriasis/#ref-9) Psoriasis is thought to be caused by an excessive immune response, which results in an overabundance of skin cells regenerating. The development of psoriasis includes a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological components.
