We know that we should eat fresh, whole foods and preferably organic and chemical free. Naturopathic Nutrition takes a holistic view of health and considers that food is itself medicine and that wellness begins with what we put into our bodies. Naturopathic Nutrition is an evidence based approach to health which treats the body as a whole, while takings into account our unique biological make up and lifestyles factors. It seeks to get to the core of health issues rather than following the common approach in conventional medicine of only treating the symptoms. Naturopathic Nutrition promotes the therapeutic effect of foods for specific health conditions and the benefit of good, wholesome foods and clean water to optimise general wellbeing. As a qualified Naturopathic Nutrition practitioner, April Danann believes that natural foods are always the first line of treatment for everyone, whatever stage of life. As part of a Medical Intuitive consultation process, April will want to understand your medical history and current health status, whether you are wishing to alleviate a specific symptom or improve your overall health. Your personal health, symptoms and goals will be discussed and a personalised nutrition plan will be devised on this basis. Nutritional therapy helps you to identify the unprocessed whole foods that make you look and feel your best. Explaining Intermittent Fasting & Fasting Cardio April herself practices and is an advocate for intermittent fasting, which is about eating patterns rather than dieting. Intermittent fasting is predicated on when you eat rather than what you eat and that there's a benefit to health in the periods of time between meals as much as the meals themselves. Humans have actually been fasting throughout evolution, back to the days when our ancestors survived by hunting and gathering when food was available and having to fast when it wasn't. It is only in recent times that (in the developed world, at least) food has become constantly available, so having three meals a day is perhaps less natural than having an eating pattern that includes intermittent fasting. When intermittent fasting is combined with exercise it is known as Fasted Cardio. Simply put, studies have shown that exercising in a fasted state can burn fat more efficiently compared with exercising after a meal. If appropriate, April can create a wellness plan for you that combines Naturopathic Nutrition with Intermittent Fasting or Fasting Cardio. Naturopathic Nutrition is not intended to replace conventional medicines but to complement them, and, where necessary, dietary changes can be made under the supervision of a Medical Doctor. "}
