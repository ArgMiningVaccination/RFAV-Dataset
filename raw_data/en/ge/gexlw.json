All Kirschstein-NRSA trainees must meet specific citizenship requirements - for details, see Item 8. Non-NRSA Research Training. Awards that provide predoctoral and postdoctoral research training support through non-NRSA funding authorities. These training programs generally do not have the same provisions and requirements as Kirschstein-NRSA awards (e.g., specific citizenship requirements). Career Development. Awards that provide doctoral-level investigators an opportunity to enhance their research careers. Individuals appointed to institutional career development awards must meet specific citizenship requirements\u2014for details, see Item 8. Research Education. Awards that provide support for programs intended to attract investigators to a specific field of study. Individuals appointed to research education award Information and Instructions for Completing Statement of Appointment (Form PHS 2271) PHS 2271 (Rev. 08/12) \u2014 Instructionsprograms may or may not be subject to specific citizenship requirements\u2014for details, see Item 8. Types of Appointments Trainee. A person appointed to and supported by an institutional Kirschstein-NRSA or non- NRSA research training award. Scholar. A person appointed to and supported by an institutional career development award. Participant. A person appointed to and supported by a research education award. B.

Check the box corresponding to the trainee's, scholar's, or participant's citizenship and visa status. If not a U.S. citizen, list the country of citizenship. A noncitizen national is an individual who, although not a citizen of the United States, owes permanent allegiance to the United States. Individuals in this category are generally born in lands which are not States, but which are under U.S. sovereignty, jurisdiction, or administration (e.g., American Samoa). Kirschstein-NRSA trainees and institutional career development scholars must be U.S. citizens, non- citizen nationals, or permanent residents of the United States. Individuals on temporary or student visas are not eligible. Trainees or scholars in these programs who are permanent residents of the U.S. must submit a notary's signed statement with this appointment form certifying that they have (1) a Permanent Resident Card (USCIS Form I-551), or (2) other legal verification of such status. Trainees in non-NRSA research training programs and participants in research education award programs should consult the applicable Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) for citizenship requirements. Item 9. Permanent Mailing Address. Give an address where the appointed individual can be reached by mail after completion of the program. (Do not give present address unless it is considered permanent as defined above.) Items 10-13. Race/Ethnicity/Disability/Disadvantaged Background. Responses to these items will help provide statistical information on the participation of individuals from diverse groups in Public Health Service (PHS) programs and identify inequities in terms of recruitment and retention based on race, ethnicity, disability and/or disadvantaged background. Trainees, scholars, and participants are strongly encouraged to provide this information, however declining to do so will in no way affect their appointments. This information will be retained by the PHS in accordance with and protected by the Privacy Act of 1974. Racial/ethnic/disability/background data are confidential and all analyses utilizing the data will report aggregate statistical findings only and will not identify individuals. (See the Privacy Act Statement at the end of these instructions for more information.) 10. Are you Hispanic (or Latino)? Hispanic or Latino: A person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race. The term, \"Spanish origin,\" can be used in addition to \"Hispanic or Latino\". PHS 2271 (Rev. 08/12) \u2014 Instructions11. What is your racial background? Check one or more. American Indian or Alaska Native. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North, Central, or South America and maintains tribal affiliation or community. Asian. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent including, for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam. Black or African American. A person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa. Terms such as \"Haitian\" or \"Negro\" can be used in addition to \"Black or African American.\" Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands. White. A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa. 12. Do you have a disability? Disability: A physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. 13. Are you from a disadvantaged background? Disadvantaged Background: An individual is considered to be from a disadvantaged background if he or she: 1. Comes from a family with an annual income below established low-income thresholds, published by the U.S. Bureau of the Census ; adjusted annually for changes in the Consumer PriceIndex; and adjusted by the Secretary for use in all health professions programs. The Secretary periodically publishes these income levels at http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/index.shtml Individuals falling in this category must have qualified for Federal disadvantaged assistance or have received Health Professional Student Loans (HPSL), Loans for Disadvantaged Student Program, or scholarships from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under the Scholarship for Individuals with Exceptional Financial Need. . 2. Comes from a social, cultural, or educational environment, such as that found in certain rural or inner-city environments, that has demonstrably and recently directly inhibited the acquisition of the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to develop and participate in a research career. This category is most applicable to high school and perhaps undergraduate students, but more difficult to justify for individuals beyond that level of achievement. Item 14. Field of Training (FOT). Provide a single numeric FOT code from the list below that best fits the research training that will be provided during the appointment. Use the subcode (nonbold lowercase) unless the broader category (bold uppercase) fits best. PHS 2271 (Rev. 08/12) \u2014 Instructions1000 I.

Indicate the total amount the appointee expects to receive from the grant during the appointment period. For trainees, provide stipend amount, tuition/fees, and travel. For career development scholars and research education award participants, report only the salary or subsistence allowance to be received from the grant, on the line for stipend/salary/other compensation. Item 21. Statement of Nondelinquency on U.S. Federal Debt. A \"Statement of Nondelinquency on Federal Debt\" is required for each particular appointment period and is to be completed by each individual (trainee) appointed to receive financial support under a PHS institutional training grant. If the prospective trainee is delinquent on Federal debt, the PHS must review the explanation required to be provided on, or attached to, the form. In such case the PHS shall (a) take such information into account when determining whether the prospective trainee is responsible with respect to that appointment, and (b) consider not approving the appointment until payment is made or satisfactory arrangements are made with the agency to whom the debt is owed. Therefore, it may be necessary for the PHS to contact the prospective trainee before the appointment can be approved to confirm the status of the debt and ascertain the payment arrangements for its liquidation. Individuals failing to liquidate indebtedness to the Federal Government in a businesslike manner place themselves at risk of not receiving PHS financial assistance. PHS 2271 (Rev. 08/12) \u2014 InstructionsThe PHS awarding component shall notify the sponsoring institution in writing of its decision regarding the approval of a prospective appointee where this form discloses delinquency on Federal debt. The trainee must check the appropriate box. If the \"Yes\" box is checked, please provide an explanation in the space provided. The question applies only to the person requesting financial assistance, and does not apply to the person who signs the form as the Program Director. Examples of Federal Debt include delinquent taxes, audit disallowances, guaranteed or direct student loans, FHA loans, business loans, and other miscellaneous administrative debts. For purposes of this certification, the following definitions of \"delinquency\" apply: For direct loans and fellowships (whether awarded directly to the applicant by the Federal Government or by an institution using Federal funds), a debt more than 31 days past due on a scheduled financial payment. (This definition excludes service payback under a National Research Service Award.) For guaranteed and insured loans, recipients of a loan guaranteed by the Federal Government that the Federal Government has repurchased from a lender because the borrower breached the loan agreement and is in default.
