Limitations: Cosmetic dentistry for cosmetic purposes only is prohibited. Services: Services will include routine dental examinations, prophylaxes, radiographs, restorative therapies, basic oral surgery (e.g., extractions and biopsy), endodontics, and prosthodontics. Referral for specialized care should be completed if clinically indicated. Emergency procedures will be treated on a walk-in basis as availability and funding allow. Funded OH providers are permitted to provide necessary emergency care regardless of a client's annual benefit balance. Oral health services are an allowable core service with an expenditure cap of $3,000 per client per calendar year. Local service regions may set additional limitations on the type or number of procedures covered and/or may set a lower expenditure cap, so long as such criteria are applied equitably across the region and the limitations do not restrict eligible individuals from receiving needed oral health services outlined in their individualized dental treatment plan. In the cases of emergency need and/or where extensive care is needed, the maximum amount may exceed the above cap. Dental providers are required to document the reason for exceeding the yearly maximum amount and must have documented approval from the local Administrative Agency (AA) for the purposes of funds only, but not the appropriateness of the clinical procedure. Universal Standards: Service providers for Oral Health Services must follow [HRSA/DSHS Universal Standards](/hivstd/taxonomy/universal.shtm) 1-46 and 65-67. Service Standards and Measures: The following standards and measures are guides to improving health outcomes for people living with HIV throughout the State of Texas within the Ryan White Part B and State Services Program. |Standard||Measure| | | Dental and Medical History: To develop an appropriate treatment plan, the oral health care provider should obtain information about the patient's health and medication status. At a minimum, medical history and limited physical evaluation should be obtained and reviewed at the initial appointment and updated annually. This information may include but not be limited to, the following: | | | | Limited Physical Examination: The oral health provider is responsible for completing an initial limited physical examination in accordance with the Dental practitioners must also record blood pressure and pulse heart rate for invasive procedures involving sedation and anesthesia. If the dental practitioner is unable to obtain a client's vital signs, they must document in the client's chart the reason the attempt was unsuccessful. | | | | Oral Examination: Clients must have an initial comprehensive oral exam, a periodic recall oral evaluation, or a problem-focused oral exam once per year. This should consist of one of the following: | | |Periodontal Screening or Examination: All clients should receive a periodontal screen or exam at least annually unless the client was only seen for evaluation or treatment of a dental emergency. This may consist of either a comprehensive initial screen or an annual re-evaluation. | The initial periodontal screen should include the assessment of medical and dental histories, the quantity and quality of attached gingiva, bleeding, tooth mobility, and a radiological review of the status of the periodontium and dental implants. The comprehensive periodontal examination should include: Annual re-evaluation should include follow-up on previously identified issues and evaluation for any new or emerging periodontal concerns. Some forms of periodontal disease may be more severe in individuals affected with immune system disorders. Patients with HIV may have especially severe forms of periodontal disease, and the incidence of necrotizing periodontal diseases may increase with clients with AIDS. | | | | Dental Treatment Plan: A dental treatment plan that includes preventive care, maintenance, and elimination of oral pathology should be developed and discussed with the client. Treatment options should be selected in collaboration with the client. | | | | Initial Treatment Plan: New clients should receive a treatment plan that includes prevention, maintenance, and/or elimination of oral pathology that results from dental caries or periodontal disease. This plan should be completed within the first year of services and should include: The initial treatment plan, if the care was completed on schedule, should be completed within 12 months of initiating treatment. | | | | Oral Health Education: Oral health education must be provided and can be documented by either a licensed dentist, dental hygienist, dental assistant, or dental case manager. Education should address the following topics: Additional areas for instruction may include nutrition. For pediatric clients, oral health education should be provided to parents and caregivers and must be age appropriate. | | | | Referrals: Referrals for other services should be made when specialized care is indicated, or other medical issues are identified during dental care. Referrals must be documented in the client's oral health care chart and should have follow-up documentation, including the outcomes of the referral. | | | | Expenditure Documentation: In the cases of emergency need and/or where extensive care is needed, the maximum cost may exceed the $3000 per client per calendar year expenditure cap. Dental providers are required to document the reason for exceeding the yearly maximum amount and must have documented approval from the local Administrative Agency (AA) for the purposes of funds only, but not the appropriateness of the clinical procedure. | | References Committee on Dental Standards of Care.
