The control of some childhood diseases has proved to be dicult even in countries that maintain high vaccination coverage. This may be due to the use of imperfect vaccines, and therehas been much discussion on the dierent modes by which vaccines might fail. To understand the epidemiological implications of some of these dierent modes, we performed a systematic analysis of a model based on the standard susceptible-infectious-recovered equations with a vaccinated compo-nent that permits vaccine failure in degree (\"leakiness\"), take (\"all-or-nothingness\"), and duration(waning of vaccine-derived immunity). The model was rst considered as a system of ordinary dif-ferential equations and then extended to a system of partial dierential equations to accommodateage structure. We derived analytic expressions for the steady states of the system and the nal agedistributions inthe case of homogenous contact rates. The stability of these equilibriaare determined by a threshold parameter R p, a function of the vaccine failure parameters and the coverage p.T h e value of pfor which Rp= 1 yields the critical vaccination ratio, a measure of herd immunity. Using this concept, we can compare vaccines that confer the same level of herd immunity to the populationbut may fail at the individual level in dierent ways. For any xed R p>1, the leaky model results in the highest prevalence of infection, while the all-or-nothing and waning models have the samesteady state prevalence. The actual composition of a vaccine cannot be determined on the basis ofsteady state levels alone, but the distinctions can be made by looking at transient dynamics (suchas after the onset of vaccination), the mean age of infection, the age distributions at steady state of the infected class, and the eect of age-specic contact rates.

EPIDEMIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF IMPERFECT VACCINES 1811 2. Vaccine 2. Provides no protection to a fraction of the vaccinees and perfect lifetime immunity to the remainder. 3. Vaccine 3. Provides perfect protectio n to each vaccinee for an exponentially distributed \"waning time,\" after whic h the vaccinee becomes as susceptible as unvaccinated individuals. The probability of immunity waning within a vaccinated host's lifetime is given by . These examples illustrate the three dierent avenues of vaccine failure that are commonly considered in the literature. McLean and Blower [14] introduced the fol- lowing terminology: when a vaccine only reduces the probability of infection uponexposure but does not eliminate it as in the case of vaccine 1, this is called failure indegree. When a vaccine has no eect on some individuals but confers complete protection in others as in the case of vaccine 2, this is called failure in take.W h e n the protection conferred wanes over time as with vaccine 3, this is termed failure in duration. Halloran, Haber, and Longini [6] used the term leakyvaccine (inspired by the literature on malaria) to describe a vaccine that only exhibits failure in degree, and all-or-nothing vaccine for one that demonstrates failure in take. A vaccine that only displays failure in duration is called a waningvaccine. Farrington [4] lists the vaccine for pertussis as a possibly leaky vaccine, those for measles and rubella as all-or-nothing vaccines, and that for cholera as a waning vaccine. Vaccines 1, 2, and 3 are examples of leaky, all-or-nothing, and waning vaccines, respectively. The direct eects of these vaccines at the individual level are given in their descriptions, but the indirect protection that they confer as a result of reduc- tion in disease transmission (herd immunity) is not so easily surmised from individual eects. It is important to examine this as it may have signicant implications in the control of the disease at the population level. Conversely, it might also be possibleto deduce information on the individual-level eects from population data on disease incidence. Using a susceptible-infectio us-recovered (SIR) model with a vaccine com- ponent, we can compare the dynamics of vaccines 1-3. Under the same assumptionson the disease, it can be shown that the critical proportion of the model population that needs to be vaccinated in order to drive the disease to extinction is the same for all three. Furthermore, if the coverage is maintained below the critical ratio, then the disease remains endemic in the model population at a higher level for vaccine 1, while the levels for vaccines 2 and 3 are equal. These results follow from our investi-gation of the model in sections 2-4. Dierent transient dynamics and contrasting age distributions of the infected class are also di scussed in these sections. Numerical sim- ulations indicate that vaccines 1 and 3 may display a signicant \"honeymoon period,\"a temporary period of very low disease inci dence after the initiation of vaccination programs. On the other hand, vaccine 2 appears to display a more stable transition from prevaccine to vaccine-era steady states. In this paper we present a systematic analysis of a general model of an imperfect vaccine. We begin by consider ing an unstructured population described by a system of ordinary dierential equations (ODEs) similar to that presented by McLean and Blower [14]. It is assumed that the disease follows standard SIR dynamics. A vac- cinated class is added with connections that represent the three avenues of vaccinefailure. We also extend this into an age-structured model using the McKendrick-Von F\u00a8orster formalism[13, 19]. The age-structuredequations consist of a system of partial dierential equations (PDEs) which allows for age-specic transmission. We establish the well-posedness of this system, nd expressions for the disease-free and endemic steady states, and derive a threshold parameter R p(the basic reproduction number incorporating the eects of vaccination) that determines the stability of these equi- Downloaded 12/12/14 to 71.205.60.120.

We also provide conditions for which dierent types of vaccines have the same steady state values and prove that a purely leaky model results in the highest level of endemic infection among all models wit h the same ecacy. Finally, we also show that the three special cases (leaky, all-or-nothing, and waning) have distinct transientdynamics followingthe inception ofmassvaccination, and distinct agedistributions at steady state of the infected class (even in the case of homogenous transmission) which may adjust in contrasting ways to changes in vaccination coverage. To illustrate our results, we present gures that compare th e steady state infection level, mean age of infection, and age distributions for vaccines 1-3. Models of vaccines exhibiting failures in degree, take, and duration have been studied before in the literature [1, 4, 5, 14]. These models have typically consisted of systems of ODEs or integral equations. Arino, Connell McCluskey, and van denDriessche [1] analyzed a general ODE model si milar to that presented here, but their model also accounts for the waning of disease-induced immunity as well as the vac- cination of susceptibles (not only as newborns). They applied a result by Li and Muldowney [11] to prove global results under certain conditions. Depending on the norm used in the proof, global stability can be conrmed in dierent subsets of theparameter space. However, in all of these subsets the mean duration of the infec- tious period is required to be longer than the other time scales in the model such as the expected lifetime. Arino, Connell McCluskey, and van den Driessche [1] alsoshowed that backward bifurcations can occur when vaccine-induced immunity lasts longer than disease-induced immunity. With childhood diseases we generally expect the infectious periodto be muchshorterthanourothertime scalesandexpect disease- induced immunity to last longer than vacci ne-derived protection. In our model we keep the focus on vaccination programs for newborns only and make the simplify-ing assumption that disease-induced immunity is permanent. This leads to a less complicated model which still incorporates the dierent facets of vaccine failure and allows for a more complete characterization of their eects on population-level dy-namics. The distinction between the modes of vaccine failure is also relevant in unambigu- ously measuring vaccine total eectivenes s Haber, and Longini [6] dened ecacy to be the relative change in the susceptibility of vac- cinated individuals to a specied amount of exposure to infection. In our example,vaccines 1 and 2 clearly have an ecacy of 1 . Similarly, we can dene the ecacy of vaccine 3 to also be 1 since the chance of getting infected within a lifetime is reduced by this amount. Realizing that all three candidates have the same ecacym a k e si te a s yt os e ew h yt h e ya l lh a v et h es a m e critical proportion of vaccination. However, since vaccine 1 leads to higher level of prevalence when coverage is not high enough for eradication, this vaccine is le ss eective than the other two. We also note that the focus of clinical trials is typically to measure the eectiveness of vaccines within a limited time period. It would be dicult to measure the ecacy of waningvaccines without extended follow-up on trial participants [20]. This paper is divided as follows: In section 2 we present a derivation of our model with generalparameters. In section3 weco theODEmodel into an age-structured model and analyze the resulting system of PDEs. Using these models we examine the dierences in the dynamics of the disease at the population level by considering both stationary states and transient behavior generated by the dierent modes of failure. For the age-structured system, we also illustrate how theage distribution of the steady state infected class, under the assumption of both Downloaded 12/12/14 to 71.205.60.120.

We summarize our results and give som e concluding remarks in section 5. 2. An ODE model of an imperfect vaccine. The model is illustrated in Figure 1. Let V(t) be the fraction of the total population that is in the vaccinated state. By this state we mean the proportion of the population that was vaccinated and enjoys some protection from the vaccine. (The vaccine did not fail in take in these individuals, and their immunity has not waned yet.) Let S(t) be the fraction that is in the susceptible class. This includes the vaccinated individuals for whom the vaccine had no eect from the beginning, as well as those whose immunity has waned by time t. The remaining compartments are I(t)a n dR(t), fractions of the total population in the infectious and recove red states, respectively. To be consistent with these denitions, we require that V(t)+S(t)+I(t)+R(t) = 1 for all t/greaterorequalslant0. Suppose that the model population has equal birth and death rates of .M o s t of the connections in Figure 1 between S,I,a n dRare from the standard Kermack- McKendrick SIR model [9, 18].

We expand upon the SIR model by adding the vaccinated class V with connections to SandI. For all t/greaterorequalslant0, a constant fraction pof the newborns are assumed to be vaccinated. Of this fraction, a proportion A[0,1) (the all-or- nothing parameter) exhibit failure in take and go directly instead to the susceptibleclass. The individuals in the vaccina ted class experience a reduction by L[0,1) (the leakiness parameter) in the probability of getting infected. Vaccine protection is also assumed to wane at a rate of =W 1W. This parametrization was chosen so that the parameter Wis the probability that the vaccine protection of individuals in theVclass wanes within a lifetime given that they do not get infected rst. (2.1) W= +=rate at which vaccine protection wanes rate at which individuals leave the Vclass ifL=0. The choice of Walso results in this parameter having the same range of W[0,1) and the same weight in determining the stability of the disease-free equilibrium as bothLandA. This will be shown later on when we dene the basic reproduction number of this system Rp. Going back to the three vaccines we considered in section 1, vaccine 1 is given by (L,A,W)=(,0,0), vaccine 2 by ( L,A,W)=( 0,,0), and vaccine 3 by (L,A,W)=( 0,0,). The waning rate of vaccine 3 is = 1, which translates to a waning rate that is exponentially distributed with mean equal to1 times the expected host lifetime.

In our example, vaccines 1-3 all have =1, consistent with the values for ecacy discussed in section 1. The parameters of the model and their defau lt values used in simulations and sample plots are summarized in Table 1. The default value of the recovery and transmission rates were chosen to have the infectious period and basic reproduction number of pertussis. The special cases of the imperfect vaccine model that we consider in oursimulations are summarized in Table 2. 3. Dynamics and properties of the ODE model. In this sectionwe examine the properties of the imperfect vaccine ODE model (Denition 2.1) with a focus onits equilibria. In Proposition 3.1, the well-posedness of the model and the invariance of solutions in the positive orthant are established. We also derive expressions for the disease-free and endemic equilibria and establish the threshold property of the basic reproduction number R pin determining the existence and stability of these steady states. The critical vaccination ratio pcis dened in Denition 3.1 to be the minimum vaccination probability required to drive the disease to extinction, if this is possible. We also state Propositions 3.2-3.3,which present results on the equality of the steady states for dierent combinations of the vaccine failure parameters ( L,A,W)a n d prove that for a xed value of , the purely leaky model provides an upper bound on the steady state level of infection. At the end of the section we show plots of the steady states of the special cases as dier ent parameters are varied (Figure 2). We also present some interesting transient d ynamics displayed by the leaky and waning vaccines models at the onset of a vaccination program (Figure 3). Proposition 3.1.

If the stronger condition R0<1holds, then the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically sta- ble, i.e., for any set of nonnegative initial conditions the solutions satisfy (V(t),S(t),I(t),R(t))(V0,S0,I0,R0)ast . 5.IfRp>1, then the disease-free equilibrium is unstable and only initializa- tions with I(0) = 0 will approach this equilibrium. In this case the endemic equilibrium (V,S,I,R)is locally asymptotically stable. Proof. The proof of item 1 is standard. The proof of items 2-3 is trivial for the L=0c a s e .F o rt h e L>0 case, we derive a quadratic equation (A.1) for Vfrom the system of equations, and the manipulations are given in the appendix. The onlyroot of the quadratic equation that can lead to ( V ,S,I,R)Dis given in (3.1). We also show that ( V,S,I,R)=/parenleftbig V0,S0,I0,R0/parenrightbig whenRp= 1. For all allowable parameter values, V>0, but the nonnegativity of all components of the endemic equilibrium only occurs when Rp/greaterorequalslant1(refer to Proposition A.3).

It is possible to show that L(1W)(R01)1/lessorequalslant0w h e nRp=1 .T h u si ti sc l e a r from (3.2) that Rp= 1 is the point at which Ichanges sign. The basic reproduction number Rpas a function of vaccination rate pof the system (2.2) was derived using the next-generation matrix method. (Refer to [18]for a discussion of this method.) This guarantees the local asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium in the case when R p<1 and instability when Rp>1. Global asymptotic stability in the case when R0<1 can be proved using a Lyapunov function L(I(t)) =I(t): d dtL(I(t)) = [(S+LV)(+)]I=(+)(R0(S+LV)1)I. SinceS+LV/lessorequalslantS+V/lessorequalslant1, the derivative is negative-denite in the case when R0<1. For the proof of local asymptotic stability of the endemic equilibrium for Rp>1, we prove that the dominant eigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix evaluated at this steady state lies on the left half of the complex plane (see Proposition A.4).

The critical vaccination proportion pcis given by pc=/parenleftbigg 11 R0/parenrightbigg1 , if this expression is less than or equal to one. By Proposition 3.1, if p>p c,t h e nRp<1 and the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable. For the same disease, the critical vaccination ratio de-pends only on and hence is the same for vaccines 1-3 in our example from section 1. In Proposition 3.2, we derive conditions on the vaccine failure parameters that lead to the same steady state values. We also prove that for a xed value of ,t h e leakymodelprovidesanupperboundontheinfectionlevelinProposition3.3. Applied to our example vaccines, these results show that the disease-free and endemic steady states of vaccines 2 and 3 are identical while vaccine 1 results in a larger infection at the endemic steady state. Proposition 3.2. Suppose that P (1)is the set of parameter values with vac- cine failure parameters (L,A,W)=((1) L,(1)A,(1)W)andP(2)is another set with (L,A,W)=((2) L,(2)A,(2)W). All other parameters are the same in P(1)andP(2). Then the following hold: 1.The component values at the disease-free equilibrium are the same for either parameter set independent of the value of (1) Land(2) the endemic equilibrium are the same for either parameter set as long as (1) L=(2) L=L, and either (i)i nt h ec a s ew h e from the expressions derived in Proposi- tion 3.1.

The last inequality is clearly true when Rp>1, and it follows that the value of the endemic steady state increases with x. Thus the maximum occurs when L=1 andA=W=0 . In the bifurcation diagrams and sample simulations that we present in this paper, we use vaccines 1, 2, and 3 as examplesfor the leaky, all-or-nothing(denoted by AON) and waning models, respectively. When is not being varied, we set =0.2( r e f e rt o Table2). InFigures2(a)-(c)weplottheinfectedclasssteadystate Iagainstdierent model parameters. When any parameter is xed and its value is not indicated in thegure, it is set to the default value in Table 1. In Figure 2(d) we plot the imaginary part of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix against the parameter and show that the value is slightly smaller for the leaky model. This indicates that the leaky modelhas a slightly longer period for small oscillations, at least for the parameter ranges that we have chosen. Although not shown, this statement is supported by simulations of stochastic versions of the models and deriving the dominant frequencies. It is clear from Proposition 3.2 and Figure 2 that we cannot uniquely identify the parameters of vaccine failure using steady state data alone. In particular, wecannot distinguish between the all-or-nothing and waning model by just looking at the equilibrium values of the components. Furthermore, in practice we may only have data available on I orR, and it would be dicult to determine how the remaining population splits up between S(which includes vaccinated individuals whose immunity has waned) and V. Since the vaccine failure parameters may be indeterminable from steady state data, we turn our attention to transient dynamics. In Figure 3 numerical simulations were used to compare the behavior of solutions after the start of vaccination pro- grams employing the three special cases o f vaccines. Here we nally observe a clear distinction between the dynamics of an all-or-nothing model and a waning model with the same value of . Simulations such as the one shown indicate that the lat- ter displays an initial drop to low disease prevalence after the start of vaccination and then recovers to have the same steady state value as the all-or-nothing model. This temporary period of low disease prevalence is called the honeymoon period. Forthe set of parameter values that we chose, the all-or-nothing model does not appear to display a signicant honeymoon period while the leaky model does. These are important considerations for vaccination programs. Furthermore, these observations present an alternative explan ation for the observed \"resurgence\" of some diseases like pertussis in highly vaccinated regions.

One canalso check that a simulation with ( L,A,W)=( 12 1,12 1,0) shows intermediate behavior between the leaky and all-or-nothing models. 4. An age-structured PDE model of an imperfect vaccine. In this section we introduce age structure to the model using an extension of the McKendrick-von F\u00a8orster population model [13, 19]. This extension is standard and is also used by Inaba [8] and Thieme [17]. A formal deni tion of the imperfect vaccine PDE model is given in Denition 4.1. The equations have been set up so that adding up the compo- nents yields the basic McKendrick-von F\u00a8 orster population model. This is consistent Downloaded 12/12/14 to 71.205.60.120.

To keep the focus on the dierent modes of vaccine failure we also assume that the total population is already at its equilibrium age distribution.

We assume that the total population is already in equilibrium at t=0 so the initial conditions are required to satisfy v(a)+s(a)+i(a)+r(a)=ea, as well as, v(0) =(1A)p, s(0) =(1(1A)p),i(0) = 0,r(0) = 0. The function b(t,a,x) incorporates the contact and transmission rate between individuals of ages aandxat time t. The initial age distribution given in (4.4) guarantees that the total population is already at a steady state age distribution but each component is not necessarily at equilibrium. This is discussed further in Proposition 4.1. Proposition 4.1. There exists a unique classical solution to the system (4.1) w h i c hi sd e n e df o r t/greaterorequalslant0.F u r t h e r m o r e ,f o r t/greaterorequalslant0, v(t,a)+s(t,a)+i(t,a)+r(t,a)=ea, /integraldisplay 0[v(t,a)+s(t,a)+i(t,a)+r(t,a)]da=1. Proof. Local existence and uniqueness follows from setting up the PDE problem (4.1) as an abstract semilinear Cauchy problem in the Banach space L1([0,),R4 +) as in [8]. The nonnegativity of the solution follows from applying the formula forintegration along characteristics for vands, and then writing the equation for ias an abstract Cauchy problem (see [8]). Letn(t,a)=v(t,a)+s(t,a)+i(t,a)+r(t,a) and consider the system n(t,a) t+n(t,a) a=n(t,a),n(t,0) =, n(0,a)=ea, which is derived from (4.1)-(4.3).

The global existence and uniqueness of the solution follow from the positivity and boundedness of the solutions for all t/greaterorequalslant0. It is clear that for a constant contact rate b(t,a,x)=, integrating the PDE system (4.1) over all ages yields the original ODE system (2.2).

EPIDEMIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF IMPERFECT VACCINES 1823 The existence and stability of the disease-free and endemic equilibria of the system (4.1) is determined by Rpas in Proposition 3.1. Proof. The steady states are found by setting all derivatives with respect to time in (4.1) equal to zero. To nd the disease-free equilibrium we set i(t,a)=0 . T h i s leads to an ODE system that has solutions given by (4.6), and this exists for all allowable parameter values. In the homogenous case, the steady state expression for i(t,a) is independent of tanda. To solve for the endemic equilibrium, the expressions (4.7) and (4.8) can be derived by performing the integration with a xed i(t,a)=. With the endemic steady state expression i(a)k n o w n ,i ti sp o s s i b l et os o l v e for. The expression for for the all-or-nothing case is easy to derive. When Landare not both zero, simplifying =/integraltext 0i(x)dxleads to (4.9). Solving for a nonzero and substituting =zyields the solution z=Ias in (3.2) in Proposition 3.1. From this earlier result, the existence, uniqueness, and positivity of the endemic equilibrium is guaranteed when Rp>1. The proof of local stability is straightforward. If Rp<1, Proposition 3.1 states that if the initial conditions are close enough to the disease-free equilibrium, I(t)=/integraltext 0i(t,a)da0a n di(t,a,x)=I(t)0a st.T h u s , a s t, (4.1) approach a linear system that can be solved by integration along the character- istics starting from a= 0. From this derive that ( v(t,a),s(t,a),i(t,a),r(t,a)) (v0(a),s0(a),i0(a),r0(a)) ast. Similarly, if Rp>1 and we start close to the en- demic mean age of infection in the case when b(t,a,x)=, we divide the (3.2). For xed =1, the leaky and all-or-nothing models have the same mean age of infection at = 0 (corresponding to Rp=1 ) ,a n dt h e gap between that and the mean age of the waning model is given byp (+)((1p)+). In Figure 4 we plot and the mean age of infection as a function of when the transmission rate is xed at b(t,a,x)=. These are shown for the standard three special cases as well as for a combined model where ( L,A,W)=( 13 0.8,1 3 0.8,13 0.8). The values could be analytically calculated using the steady state expressions in Proposition 4.2. The mean age of infection at steady state plots showthat the lowest mean age of infection occurs in vaccine 2, the all-or- hing example. This is followed by vaccine 1, the leaky example, and then the combined model. Unsurprisingly, vaccine 3, the purely waning model, has the highest mean age ofinfection. This plot shows another observ able distinction between vaccines 2 and 3 which could not be dierentiated using the steady state data without age structure. In Figure 5 we plot the age distribution of the infected class (divided into school age classes) for the three special cases as a function of the infant vaccination proba- bilityp.

We normalized the contact matrix so that it has a mean value that is the same as . In the case with homogenous contact rates the distributions can be analytically calculated from the expressions in Proposition 4.2.In the case with age-specic contacts the steady states were numerically evaluated. It is clear from Proposition 4.2 that dierent vaccine failure parameters will lead to dierent distributions even with the same . Interestingly, the distributions of the age classes respond in dierent manners as pis increased. In particular we note that in the case with age-structured contacts, as pis increased the proportion of the infected class aged 1-7 appear to grow for the leaky case, remain roughly the same for the all-or-nothing case, and decrease for the waning case. 5. Summary and conclusions. Clinical trials focus on the benets that vac- cines provide at the individual level. In these controlled experiments the eects on herd immunity cannot be measured directly. Using models, we can extrapolate fromindividual to population-level eects and determine the epidemiological ramications of using dierent types of imperfect vacci nes. We considered a mathematical model of an imperfect vaccine that may exhibit failures in degree (leakiness), take (all-or-nothingness) and duration (waning of vaccine-derived immunity). Vaccines 1, 2, and 3, described in section 1, are special cases corresponding to the leaky, all-or-nothing, and waning models, respectively. The ODE equations, given in Denition 2.1, were derived in section 2 with the underlying assumption that the disease without vaccina- tion follows SIR dynamics. In the same section we dened a vaccine impact parameterconsistent with other denitions of vacci ne eectiveness in [4] and [14]. Based on this, we showed how vaccines 1-3 are comparable to each other in terms of vaccine individual-level ecacy. In section 3 we examined the dynamics of the ODE model. In Proposition 3.1 the disease-free and endemic steady states of the model were derived. The stability of these steady states depend on the value of the basic reproduction number R p,w h i c h depends on .

The all-or-nothing model and the waning model exhibit the same steady state values for the same value of . For a xed value of , we showed in Proposition 3.3 that the highest level of infection is obtained if all of the vaccine failure stems from leakiness. There have been other studies that point toward this result. White et al. [20] and Smith, Rodrigues, and Fine [16] comparedthe ecacy ofleakyand all-or-nothingvaccines andconcluded that a leaky vaccine performs worse than a n all-or-nothing vaccine. However, in these papers the comparisons were done assuming a constant force of infection. In Proposition3.3wecomparedthe vaccinemodels inthe casewhen theforceofinfectionactually depends on the choice of vaccine. Atthe endofsection3wepresentedgraphsofthesteadystatesofthe specialcases of the vaccines from section 1. The all-or-nothing and waning models were shown tohave the same steady states (consistent with Proposition 3.2), while the leaky model had a higher level of infection at endemic state (consistent with Proposition 3.3). The leaky model was also observed to have a longer period for small oscillations compared to the other two. Sample simulations of the onset of a vaccination program were also included to show how transient dynamics can highlig ht the dierence between the models even when Leakyand waningmodels appearto both exhibit a \"honeymoon period\" after the onset of vaccination which the all-or-nothingmodel does not display. Although these are transient dynamics, they can have impor- tant implications for vaccination programs. Moreover, these provide an alternative explanation for the observe d \"resurgence\" of some diseas es like pertussis in regions that havemaintained high vaccinationcoverage. The risein incidence mayjust be due to the end of the honeymoon period, and the occurrence of large disease outbreaksmay be transient oscillations during a slow transition to a vaccine-era steady state. In section 4 we extended the ODE model into an age-structuredPDE model given inDenition4.1. Thewell-posednessoftheequationsandtheconsistencyofthemodelassumptions were established in Proposition 4.1. When the transmission rate is as- sumed to be constant, integrating the PDE system with respect to age leads back to the original ODE model (Remark 4.1). In this case, the disease-free and endemic steady states can be analytically derived and the stability of this equilibrium is also determined by R p. This is presented in Proposition 4.2, where the steady state age distributions ofthe model arealsogiven. The formulashowsthat the distributions are distinctfordierentsetsofvaluesoftheva ccinefailureparameters. Othersteadystate measures can also be derived from these equations that provide useful informationabout the dynamics and allow us to disting uish forthe wan- ing model, is followed by the leaky model, and is lowest for the all-or-nothing model. The age distributions of the infected class under the assumption of age-specic transmission were also examined numerically. Figure 5 shows how the proportion ofthe dierent age groups for the dierent vaccines may respond dierently to changes in vaccine coverage. For our choice of paramet er values, the contrast was particularly pronounced for the group between the ages of 1-7. Our results suggest that there is enough dierence in the epidemiological sig- natures of imperfect vaccines to determi ne the parameters of the vaccine used in a region where the disease is endemic despite signicant vaccination coverage. It would be interesting to use the available incidence time series data on a disease like pertussis to see if an imperfect vaccine model can adequately explain the honeymoon periodand resurgence of the disease, without imposing any change in the underlying disease Downloaded 12/12/14 to 71.205.60.120.

EPIDEMIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF IMPERFECT VACCINES 1827 and vaccine dynamics. One way that we plan to test this hypothesis is to t the parameters of a stochastic imperfect vacci ne model to pertussis data using maximum likelihood estimation as in the studies by Blackwood et al. [3] and Lavine et al. [10]. To our knowledge the age-structured PDE system given in Denition 4.1 has not been analyzed before. A paper by Arino et al . [2] considers an integro-dierential equation model of the dierent types of vaccine failure (with a general waning func- tion) derived from an age-structured system. In that paper the authors focused on the system without age-structure and did not explore the eects of the vaccine failure parameters on the age distributions of the infected class. In this study we did not examine the role of seasonality in transmission rates. We alsousedexponentiallydistributedwaitingt imes(transfertimesbetweencomponents) for simplicity. This can be improved by dividing each relevant model component intomultiple compartments. For example, the Iclass could be split up into a sequence of {I i}n i=1compartments, and this would result in a gamma-distributed infective period with shape parameter of n[12]. This will be more important later on when we start tting our model to data. The infective per iod is generally expected to have less dis- persionthandescribedbyanexponentialdistribution. Ontheotherhand, estimatesofthe waning time of vaccine-derived immunity appear have more variation than the infective periodsoanexponentialdistribution mayalreadybe afairapproximationfor this. There are studies that have introduced a continuity of vaccine states to allow formoregeneraldistributionofthewaningperiodaswellasacontinuumofvaccinefailure parameters[2,4]. Transientdynamicssuchasthehoneymoonperiodandoutbreaksaf- ter the start of vaccination (illustrated in Figure 3) can be aected by the distribution of the waning period. Heernan and Keeling [7] demonstrated that an susceptible- exposed-infected-recovered model with waning, boosting of immunity, and multiplediseasecompartmentsmaygeneratesustainedcyclesofdiseaseoutbreaks. They noted that these cycles are not maintained when assuming exponential waning time. We observe this as well in the decaying magnitude of the outbreaks in Figure 3(a). Models of imperfect infection-derived immunity, like those of imperfect vaccines, are often formulated as waning immunity models. In this paper we focused on the population-level eects of a continuous range of vaccine types. A more general disease model would be one that allows for failure in degree, take, and duration in both infection and vaccine-derived immunity. We also did not consider the possibilitythat when vaccinated individuals get infected, they are less infective than they would have been without vaccination. This has b een considered in the literature dealing with vaccine ecacy on infectiousness [4]. These extensions of the model and their complex eects are topics for future work. Appendix A. Proofs.

The discriminant can be rewritten as (1 line is always nonnegative due to the range of allowable parameter values. Proposition A.2.

The results on IandRfollows if we prove that R0(1(1L)V)1/greaterorequalslant0 occurs when Rp/lessorequalslant0 with the equality only occurring at Rp= 1. This proof is simple and is omitted.

EPIDEMIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF IMPERFECT VACCINES 1829 Proof. The proof of this proposition is similar to the proof of local stability in Arino et al. [1]. Consider the system (2.2) in terms of three independent variables (V,S,I). The Jacobian Jand its second additive component J[2]( d e n e di n[ 1 1 ] ) evaluated at the endemic steady is J= of Jordered such that /Rfractur(1)/lessorequalslant/Rfractur(2)/lessorequalslant/Rfractur(3). It is trivial to show that Tr( J)<0a n dD e t ( J)<0. This allows for Det( J[2])=(1+2)(1+ 3)(2+3). It is also possible to show that if Rp>1, then Det( J[2])<0( p r o o f omitted). Since this inequality cannot hold in cases 2 and 4, only cases 1 and 3 areallowed. Thus /Rfractur( i)<0f o ri=1,2,3. This proves that the endemic equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable.
