However, it is important to realize how cleaning up one's diet can only do so much when you are absorbing an abundance of toxins and endocrine disruptors through your largest organ system, your skin. We define a toxin as anything our bodies cannot use to heal or make energy. In addition, the [National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/) defines [endocrine disrupters](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/endocrine/) as: ...chemicals that may interfere with the body's endocrine system and produce adverse developmental, reproductive, neurological, and immune effects in both humans and wildlife... Endocrine disruptors may be found in many everyday products- including plastic bottles, metal food cans, detergents, flame retardants, food, toys, cosmetics, and pesticides. The [Environmental Working Group (EWG)](https://www.ewg.org/), who creates the [Clean Fifteen and Dirty Dozen](https://www.ewg.org/foodnews/) for foods, also works to help consumers understand the toxic and [endocrine disrupting](https://www.ewg.org/consumer-guides/ewgs-guide-endocrine-disruptors) burden their [cleaning](https://www.ewg.org/guides/cleaners/) and [beauty](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/) products have on them. You can visit their site and search the products you use on a day-to-day basis to learn about your exposure levels to harmful chemicals.
