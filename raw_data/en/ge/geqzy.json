'To me,as a journalist, being a foreign correspondent isthe pinnacle. You get entr\u00e9e to extraordinarypeople and places and to intense experiences.It's special. You are doing something that peoplein other parts of the industry are not. It's very rare tomeet a reporter from another Australian network.' His assignments have included reporting the wars in Chechnya, Afghanistan and the Balkans, trackingpolar bears in the Arctic, filming at secret militarybases in central Russia and travelling by sledwith nomadic reindeer herders in Siberia. Eric joined the ABC in 1986 and worked with The Investigators and Quantum as well as news and current affairs. He applied for several overseaspositions, 'I spent a year learning Japanese thinkingI'd probably go there'. Finally in 1996 he was giventhe Moscow posting for three years. He found it very interesting although, 'when I was there itwas still fairly grim\u2014they were trying to come to terms with the new order.' In marked contrast to correspondents from overseas networks ABC reporters operate as a compact unit\u2014usually just the reporter and a cameraman. 'ABC foreign correspondents areon duty 24/7. Most days are 12 to 14 hours, but if travelling, an 18-hour day is not unusual.' Eric is writing a book about the last seven years, there are so many stories and memoriesand friendships. 'You are working in intense situations, seeing people at their most desperate. You can formsome great friendships. It is a great joy to goback and visit.'every one's accurateimpartialnews and analysisindependentsection 1 Annual Report 2003-04Contents Letter of Transmittal 1 Corporate Report ABC Vision, Mission Statement and Values 2Significant Events in the Past Year 2ABC Programs and Services 5Board of Directors 10Statement by ABC Board of Directors 12ABC Advisory Council 14The Year Ahead 15 Overview ABC Audiences 18Corporate Governance 32Financial Summary 37Corporate Plan Summary 40ABC Organisational Chart 41 ABC Divisions Radio 44Television 49New Media and Digital Services 55News and Current 62Production Services 77Human Resources 81Corporate Affairs 84Technology and Distribution 88 Summary Reports Corporate Plan Performance Summary 96Outcomes and Outputs 104ABC Subsidiaries 113 Independent Audit Report 116 Financial Statements 117 Appendices 153 ABC Charter 202 5 October 2004 The Hon.

'I went from living off thecut-and-thrust of current affairs radio to beingable to see what radio really meant to people andfinding a new and different satisfaction in being there to make sure their stories were heard.' Kate works out of Katherine in the Northern Territory and, like her rural colleagues elsewhere,often drives hundreds of kilometres across isolated areas and difficult terrain to covera story. 'A rural reporter,' she explains, 'can be seen at the saleyards covering the cattle prices, outon a header checking the crops or riding giantbulldozers at a mine. They do interviews oneverything from salinity to feral camel control.They cover agripolitics and issues of land management as well as personal stories.They put rural Australia on radio and online.' It's a long way from home for the English Honours graduate from Canberra. Kate started with ABC Radio in Perth in 1999. In 2000 she accepted a position in Karrathain the Pilbara.

Every week,the ABC directly touches the lives of aroundthree-quarters of the Australian population. The fourth ABC Appreciation Survey conducted independently by Newspoll confirms that nineout of 10 Australians believe the ABC performsa valuable job for the community. The ABC has a particular statutory mandate as a public broadcaster. While obliged to offerprograms of wide appeal, it must also presentprograms for more limited, specialised audiences. It is a mandate well exercised. The Corporation offers a breadth of quality programming that hasno rival in the Australian electronic media. TheABC's provision of programs that properly informpublic life distinguishes the public broadcaster'scontribution within the Australian media. Discussion and debate about policies and decisions that shape our lives will not alwaysmake for popular programs. This is particularlytrue of television since many people regard itprimarily as an entertainment medium. Independent and trusted News and Current Affairs programs give time and place to questioning, debate and discussion, addingdepth to the Australian democratic process. In 2003-04, ABC News and Current Affairsprograms enjoyed a greater audience sharethan ever before. The ABC continues to give prominence to a broad range of subjects and ideas that wouldotherwise be neglected because they were not the most popular. Talents are allowed to develop, rather than expected to be immediately successful.While Australian television and radio became increasingly imitative during the past year, theABC grew more imaginative and inventive. Itoffered more choice at a time when the marketwas inclined to offer less\u2014an enduring reasonfor the ABC's existence, and its continuingpoint of difference. We see that difference in the creative talents who appear on Strictly Dancing ; through new ideas brought to light by The New Inventors ; and through Television's wide range of spirited,innovative programming. Each ABC Radio network continued to reach out and respond to the interests of itsspecialised audiences. Many young Australianmusical talents were heard first on triple j , which continued to both discover and promotegenuinely original, unmistakably present-dayAustralian music. Innovative and imaginative work by New Media and Digital Services kept the Corporation at thefront line of broadcast developments. It met agrowing demand for media to be available in new and different forms with a myriad ofengaging and award-winning experiences. These contributions add up to an extraordinary range of reference points to the ABC in everydayAustralian life. Continuous Reform, Future Strategy From the mailroom to the Board Room, the Corporation's program of continuous reformhas ensured that the ABC is better governed,more efficiently managed and is delivering thebest possible dividend to the public on itsinvestment in the ABC. The Board particularly commends the managerial reforms initiated and led by Managing Director,Russell Balding. Through a steady, systematic,12 Annual Report 2003-04 board Directors Statement 'and well-ordered program of reform, the value derived from public funding has been gradually extended. The fiscal strategy applied across the Corporation following the 2003-06 triennial funding agreementwith Government has succeeded in balancingactivities to a sustainable level. The Board, too, has examined its own governance procedures and practices inaccordance with a considerable body of bestpractice guidelines, including those set out bythe Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) inits discussion paper Corporate Governance in Commonwealth Authorities and Companies . This paper provides a checklist for directors to assess the strengths and weaknesses of theirorganisation's governance framework. ABC BoardDirectors first completed the ANAO checklist in October 2001 and most recently in June 2004. A comparison of the results shows improvement across nearly every measure. The 2004 resultsconfirm that Board members believe effectivegovernance processes are in place at the ABC. The ANAO follow-up review on Corporate Governance in the ABC commended the ABC'sprogress with recommendations of the original2001 r eview\u2014more than 75% of which have been fully i mplemented or are on track, with the remainder partially implemented. The ABC Code of Practice summarises the major principles that guide ABC programs. Duringthe past year, the Editorial Policies Committeeof the ABC Board supervised revision of theCode. This revised ABC Code of Practice will become effective from 1 July 2004. The ABC Advisory Council provided the Board's Advisory Council Committee withissues-based discussion papers and advice on ABC programming derived from the widerange of community links maintained by Council members. During the Board strategy development day, consideration was given to major infrastructureand resource allocations. The Board's FinanceCommittee approved the development of aten-year capital plan for the Corporation. The Board also placed strategic priority on maximising future opportunities and possibilitiesfor the ABC, examining the Corporation'scapacity to develop quality content for all current and new media platforms. Maurice Newman AC resigned from the Board with effect from 30 June. The Boardwould like to record its appreciation for the significant contribution made to theCorporation by Mr Newman during his term.Through his Chairmanship of the Board'sFinance Committee and his work in establishingthe Directors Handbook and Code of Conducthe has created a valuable legacy. Conclusion Through persistent effort, a progressive and distinctive ABC has this year captured the Australian imagination in more ways than ever before. The Board is pleased to see that today's ABC is an enduring affirmation of public broadcasting's power to stimulate, challenge,inform and entertain and in doing so, to fullyreflect the complexity of contemporaryAustralia and its people. In 2003-04, the Board ensured that the Corporation operated within the limits ofavailable resources and is satisfied that it hasfulfilled its duties as laid out in Section 8 of theAustralian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 . The Board commends this report to the Parliament and the people of Australia.section 1 13 Annual Report 2003-04 Donald McDonald AO Chairman, Judith Sloan Deputy Chair, Russell Balding Managing Director, Leith Boully Director, Ron Brunton Director, John Gallagher QC Director, Ramona Koval Staff Elected Director, Ross McLean Director, Maurice Newman AC DirectorThe ABC Advisory Council is established under the provisions of the ABC Act to provide adviceto the Board on matters relating to broadcastingand television programs of the Corporation.

Front row seated from left : Ms Beverly Smallwood, Mr Glyn Parry, Dr Paul Collier, Ms Deborah Klika (Convenor) and Professor Michael Burgess.In last year's Annual Report, the ABC foreshadowed a period of consolidation as it commenced a new funding triennium in2003-04. The Corporation needed to take the action to operate at a sustainable level of funded activities. In May 2004, the Government announced it would extend funding of the ABC's NationalInterest Initiatives (NII) to June 2008, providinga total of $54.4 million over three years. NIIfunding enabled the Corporation to significantlyexpand its services to audiences in regionalAustralia and to generate other programming inareas such as business and finance, children'sand education. The Government also undertookto provide $17.4 million over four years inrecognition of the increasing costs of purchasingtelevision programs in Australia and internationally. This Budget outcome provided a secure financial base for the current funding triennium (whichends in June 2006) and the basis for a newthree-year Corporate Plan. The ABC will continue to position itself for the inevitable transformation of Australia's mediaenvironment, as audiences respond to a growingchoice of established and emerging digitalservices. It is essential that the ABC apply a'whole-of-audience' focus to its radio, televisionand new media services, if it is to remain relevantand valued in that changing environment. Planning priorities derive explicitly from the ABC's legislative Charter to inform, educateand entertain. The 2004-07 Corporate Planwill have four overall Objectives, which reflectthe core values of national public broadcasting: contribute to a sense of national identity engage audiences with relevant and innovative programs and services ensure the ABC's independence, integrity and high standards provide maximum benefit to the people of Australia. An important priority from 2004-05 is to create more opportunities for audiences to connectwith the diversity of their communities throughan ABC that is distinctively Australian in itsprogramming and services. Innovation in digital broadcasting is another key priority. The ABC will establish a second(digital) television channel that uses new mediaproduction and presentation methodologies todeliver operational flexibility and efficiency. Italso intends to further explore the potential of Digital Radio Broadcasting. In competing for the attention of audiences, the ABC will do so on its own terms as a non-commercial public broadcaster that offersprogramming of broad appeal and more specialised interest. The Board and management also propose to continue striving to achieve best practicestandards of corporate governance and highvalue for money to the Australian community.section 1 15 Annual Report 2003-04 The Year Ahead 0520through australian eyes Paul di Benedetto CinematographerIn 2004 Paul di Benedetto won a coveted Australian Cinematographers Society GoldenTripod for a Big Country Revisited episode. For Paul, already a multi award-winner, thiswas particularly special as he had 'revisited' a story shot 25 years previously by hismentor at the ABC, Peter Donnelly.

Responses to Research ABC Radio During 2003-04, extensive audience researchwas undertaken on behalf of ABC Local Radio.In July and August 2003, qualitative research wasundertaken in Brisbane, Gold Coast/Tweedand Melbourne to evaluate and assess theimpact of changes to program presenters and program content. Additionally, feedbackand insights from this research contributed to a better understanding of the specific information needs of the audience for each of these Local Radio stations. During August and September 2003, qualitative research was undertaken among regular andoccasional Local Radio listeners in Adelaide andSydney. This research guided specific elements of program content and to assist in further refinement of key sessions. Audience Research conducted a workshop with Perth Local Radio listeners in November 2003to assess preferred musical styles and songs.Feedback was also sought on the amount andstyle of music that listeners prefer at differenttimes of day. The research findings were used toinform the development of playlists and to buildon similar music research conducted in 2002 in Brisbane and Melbourne. It is anticipatedthat more music research workshops will beconducted with listeners in 2004. Qualitative research was undertaken in Sydney in November 2003 to assist thedevelopment of program content for Northern Grandstand which is broadcast on weekends on ABC Local Radio during the winter months.20 Annual Report 2003-04section 2 21 Annual Report 2003-04ABC Online's Monthly accesses 1999-2004 (June) 010203040506070 May Jul Sep MarJan-00MarJan-99Monthly accesses - Millions Nov May Jul Sep Nov Jan-01 May Jul Sep Jan-02Mar Nov May Jul Sep Jan-03Mar Nov MayMar 0 200 000 400 000 600 000 800 0001 000 0001 200 July 2003-June 2004 0 200 000 400 000 600 000 800 0001 000 0001 200 0001 400 0001 SeptemberOctoberNovember April May JuneMarch January 2004Unique Audience Unique Reach %ABC Online Unique Audience and Audience Reach by month July 2003 to June 2004Note: In January 2004, the recording of the ABC's online statistics changed. The ABC has implemented updated web measurement standards as recommended by the Australian Audit Bureau of Circulations.The changes include the removal of page accesses generated by search engines, spiders and botsas well as the removal of accesses generated by automated refreshes which occur during online forums.These improvements mean that direct comparison of accesses with previous years is not applicable. Source: ABC Server Statistics Source: Nielsen//NetRatings Source: Nielsen//NetRatings, Parent, Home and Work dataABC Audiences (continued) The research was undertaken among regular Northern Grandstand listeners to evaluate program content options that could bebroadcast before and after football coverage.The results of this research helped shapethe program content of Northern Grandstand in 2004. In February 2004, on behalf of ABC Local Radio, Audience Research commissionedan extensive study of the mood and frame ofmind of the Local Radio listener. This studywill continue until August 2004 and will provideinsights into how listeners feel about the worldaround them and the place of the media\u2014specifically radio and Local Radio\u2014in providingprogramming and tone which best reflects theirneeds and aspirations. The findings from thestudy will provide a framework for the strategicdirection of ABC Local Radio. The research is utilising in-depth group discussions in Brisbane,Sydney, Melbourne and Albury-Wodonga andinteractive research discussions conducted viathe Internet among a sample of Local Radiolisteners from around the country. Since 1998, triple j has seen a steady decline in the network's share of its core target audienceof 18-24 year olds. Qualitative research conducted in 2002 indicated that key factors in the decline were the entry of new competitorsto the market and the changing pattern of radiouse within the core triple j demographic, particularly in relation to other technologies. In 2004, triple j reinvigorated its program schedule to recapture its lost share of youngerlisteners. New weekday programs were introduced: the music-focussed Mel in the Mornings ; satirical afternoon talk program Today Today , presented by two members of the CNNNN team; half-hour youth affairs talk program, Hack ; and a number of new specialist music programs reflecting changing tastes in music genres. In addition, triple j has strengthened its interaction with audiencesthrough multi-platform technology.Audience feedback on these changes hasbeen very positive. The network continues to place special focus on its core 18-24 yearold demographic. ABC Classic FM refreshed its 2004 schedule to increase listeners' access to programs andconcerts and to enable better promotion of thenetwork's core activity of classical music. Thestation adopted a different approach to newmusic, discontinuing The Listening Room and New Music Australia in favour of a greater spread of original music-based works throughoutthe schedule. A new late-evening programshowcases electronic, improvised and othernew music in which Australian artists have astrong profile, and a regular daily timeslot was introduced for first-run concerts. The audience response to the changes has been positive with an average audience of 26 000 in survey 4 of 2004, compared with 10 000 in the same survey last year. In addition,the level of new music content across thenetwork has increased in 2004. ABC Television The Corporation undertook a range ofquantitative and qualitative research on behalfof ABC Television throughout 2003-04. InSeptember 2003, a quantitative survey wasundertaken among the residents of Broken Hillto determine community preference for receivingABC Television from the Sydney signal or fromAdelaide. Traditionally Broken Hill had receivedthe signal from Adelaide. For a six-month trialperiod commencing at the time of the NewSouth Wales state election the signal switchedto Sydney. Based on the research thedecision was made to continue with the signal from Sydney.22 Annual Report 2003-04ABC Television continued to utilise qualitative tracking of viewer attitudes to television programsto inform scheduling and promotional activityand to identify trends in viewer preferences for programs and genres. Further researchwas undertaken to explore viewer attitudes toAustralian-made programming, with specificemphasis on perceived improvements ordeterioration over time. This study largely confirmed attitudinal tracking research andbehavioural research measured by programratings. The outcomes helped to shape theoverall understanding of viewer attitudes and preferences. Qualitative research continued to inform ABC Television program content and schedulingdecisions. Focus groups were commissionedfor a variety of new locally-made programs.Drawing on feedback and insights from viewersand potential viewers, ABC Television enhancedprogram structures, formats and styles to bettermeet viewer expectations. ABC Online To better understand how audiences use ABC Online, extensive usability testing wasundertaken on a number of sites, includingBroadband, Rural Online and The Playground . Audience feedback on these sites was appliedto improve the ease of use, flow of contentand structure of the sites. The online environment provides an opportunity to conduct audience surveys among peoplevisiting various ABC Online sites. Surveys conducted online included: a survey amongBroadband News users seeking insights into their news and information needs; audienceexpectations and preferences for the onlineComedy site; and an extensive survey of ABC TV Online users which provided insights into how and why visitors use the site and anunderstanding of user expectations.In June 2004, qualitative and quantitative research was commissioned to inform furtherenhancements to ABC News Online . The research was conducted among users andnon-users of the service and feedback andinsights were sought on their media and newsconsumption habits, their frequency of usageand the reasons for particular spikes in usage.The research also provided insights into thedepth and breadth of content expected byaudiences visiting online news sites. Theseinsights assisted ABC News Online to enhance the content and look-and-feel of the site tobetter meet audience needs and expectations. Planning and research into future digital interactive services continued. A three-yearpartnership established in 2002-03 with theInteractive Television Research Institute atMurdoch University in Western Australia continues to focus on interactive children'stelevision. The ABC Television program Play School is being used as a test bed to develop interactive enhancements designed to stimulatechildren's interest, motivation and learning. Inthe past year, prototypes were developed andthe first round of focus groups and user-testingwith children was completed. The next stageof research includes further use of a mobilelaboratory to visit schools and kindergartens tofurther test and refine the interactive elementsof the program. During 2003-04, a digital radio trial headed by Broadcast Australia commenced in Melbourne.The ABC is a member of the consortium ofcontent providers, along with SBS, World Audio,Sport 927 and the community broadcasters.ABC Classic FM, ABC NewsRadio and dig are being broadcast on the digital spectrumthroughout the trial. From June 2004, panelswere established representing listeners andpotential listeners to the content provided by all consortium participants. It is expected thesection 2 23 Annual Report 2003-04ABC Audiences research will continue for several months and will be conducted qualitatively and quantitatively.Insights into listener reactions to and uses ofdigital radio will provide key strategic data forthe continuing development of rich and diversecontent for this new media platform. ABC Appreciation Survey 2004 In 2004, the ABC commissioned Newspoll to conduct the fifth ABC Appreciation Survey.These surveys provide an overview of communityattitudes about the ABC, and allow theCorporation to assess the value placed on itsservices by the Australian public and thedelivery of its Charter obligations. Newspollconducted similar surveys in 1998, 1999, 2002and 2003. The 2004 research was conductedby telephone between 31 May and 10 June 2004and was based on a national sample of 1 900 people aged 14 years and over. Overall Value of the ABC Across the community at large, the 2004 results show beliefs and opinions about the ABC arenot greatly different from those found in the2003 survey. Nine in ten (89%) Australianscontinue to believe the ABC provides a valuableservice to the community, and half (48%) believeit provides a 'very valuable' service. Compared with 2003, there has been a decrease in the number of 35-to-49 year oldsdescribing the ABC as 'very 58% to 51%). Looking over the past twoyears, (based on a comparatively small sample)there has also been a decline in the number of18-to-24 year olds describing the ABC in thisway (down from 45% to 31%). Notwithstanding these decreases, the proportion of people within these segments who believethe ABC and its services are valuable is stillvery high (around 90%).24 Annual Report 2003-04 88 8691 89 89 444149 50 48 020406080100 1998 1999 2002 2003 2004 Total valuable Very Valuable Statistically significant change % %Poor Good Very Good Very Poor Quite Good Quite Poor2003 2002 1999 1998 2003 2004 2004 2002 1999 199875 10080604020020406080100 2075 1878 2079 2341 440 543 541 123 112 92 8 19 5324 5418 5018 51 ABC Commerci al TV Statistically signific ant ch ange77 1 940 6 21 5320Overall Value the 13 12 29 ABC Commerci al Radio Very Good Very Poor Quite Good Quite PoorStatistically signific ant ch ange2003 2002 1999 1998 2003 2004 2004 2002 1999 1998Radio\u2014Quality of Programming(continued)All of the graphs below are based on a total sample aged 14 years and over. 'Don't Know' responses are not displayed Source: Newspoll 2004 ABC Appreciation SurveyTelevision Almost eight in ten (77%) Australians continue to believe the quality of programming on ABCTelevision is very or quite good. Consistent withprevious tranches of the survey, perceptionsabout the quality of programming on ABCTelevision are reasonably consistent acrossall demographic groups. Seven in ten (69%) Australians believe that ABC Television does a 'good job' in terms of thenumber of shows it provides they personallylike to watch. This perception has remainedconsistent across all age groups. Radio A total of 61% believe the ABC provides goodquality radio programming (6% feel it is poor).Similarly, six in ten (59%) Australians believeABC Radio does a 'good job' in terms of theamount of programming it provides to whichthey personally like to listen (only 9% feel ABC is doing a poor job). There is a greater similarity in beliefs about ABC Radio and commercial radiothan between ABC Television and commercialtelevision. Nonetheless, commercial radio tendsto attract a higher level of criticism thanABC radio. Over the past two years there has been a small but statistically significant increase in the numberof people who say ABC Radio is doing a 'verygood' job providing content they personally like(up from 19% to 23%). This appears to havebeen driven primarily by people aged 25-to-34and 50 years and over. At the same time, either in terms of perceived quality or the appeal of programming, resultsover the past two years point to a decline inperceptions about ABC Radio among thoseaged under 25 (while attitudes to commercialradio among this age group have improved).section 2 25 Annual Report 2003-04 Online The proportion of Australians who claim to use ABC Online has gradually increased from 18%to 22% over the past two years. The growthwithin this period appears to be primarily drivenby heavier users of ABC Television and/or Radio. A statistically significant increase in the proportion of users among people aged 25-to-49 hasoccurred over the past 12 months. About nine in ten (87%) of the site's users continue to rate the quality of information provided as either 'very good' or 'quite good',although the proportion ranking it as 'verygood' has fallen in 2004 from 38% to 29%, offsetting the increase in 2003. Coverage of Country News and Information Community perceptions about coverage of country news and information continue to be far more favourable for the ABC than for commercial media. This remains apparentboth among people in capital cities and peoplein country/regional areas. Three-quarters(76%) of Australians believe the ABC does a good job covering country/regional issues,compared with 43% for commercial media.Very Good Total Good020406080100 2003 2004 2002 1999 199834 34323892 8390 89 Statistically significant change2987%ABC Website\u2014Quality of InformationBased on those aged 14 years and over who ever visit the ABC website Source: Newspoll 2004 ABC Appreciation SurveyABC Audiences (continued) Other Specific Charter Obligations As found in previous years, the majority of Australians also believe the ABC is doing'a good job' in meeting various other Charterobligations covered by the research. In the two areas, 'being balanced and even handed' and 'being distinctively Australian', the gains achieved in the 2003 survey havebeen maintained. Indeed, compared with the1998 baseline reading, there has undeniablybeen a positive trend on each of these twodimensions (concerning the number who saythe ABC does a 'very good' job). Perceptions that the ABC is 'efficient and well managed', which increased significantly in 2003, have returned to levels seen in the late 1990s.The proportion of people who believe that the ABC is doing a 'very good' job of 'broadcastingprograms of an educational nature' has declinedyear-on-year. Overall, however, the proportionbelieving the ABC does a 'good' job in thisregard has remained steady across the survey series. In 2004, the number who believe the ABC is doing a good job at being 'innovative' (72%), is also higher than the 68% recorded in thebaseline survey six years ago. The proportion of people who believe the ABC is doing a good job encouraging and promotingAustralian performing arts was 77% in 2004,down 6 percentage points since 1998, anunfavourable trend in perception that theABC will endeavour to address.26 Annual Report 2003-04 Very Good Job Total Good Job% 020406080100 20032002200320022003200220032002 The 50 Statistically significant changeABC Program Does a Good Job of Being Balanced and Even-Handed Based on those aged 14 years and over who ever watch/listen to the respective program.

News and Current Affairs Content Consistent with previous tranches of the survey, eight in ten (80%) Australians believethe ABC does a good job of being balancedand even-handed when reporting news andcurrent affairs. This issue was also exploredmore specifically in relation to the ABC's flagship News and Current Affairs programs(the 7pm News, The 7.30 Report, The World Today , and AMand PM). Among viewers and listeners, the vast majority (ranging from 89%to 94%) continue to believe these programsare doing a good job of being balanced andeven-handed. The survey explored community perceptions about the amount of coverage given by the ABC to specific news and current affairsissues. Consistent with the previous two surveys, on nearly all issues a majority feel the amount of coverage is 'about right'.Audience Contacts Another important avenue for assessing theABC's performance with its core constituencyis through audience feedback, including complaints. In August 2002, the ABC enhanced its complaint handling procedures. All seriouscomplaints received by the ABC, such as concerns about factual inaccuracy, lack of balance, bias or inappropriate content, arereferred to Audience and Consumer Affairs for investigation and response. Audience andConsumer Affairs is independent of ABCprogram areas and investigates all writtencomplaints referring to possible breaches ofthe ABC's Editorial Policies , Code of Practice or Charter. The unit also coordinates responsesto a range of programming and policy enquiries. In 2003-04, the ABC received more than 160 000 audience contacts\u2014a 13% decreasecompared to the previous year. This totalincluded 51 533 letters and emails (a 10%ABC Audiences (continued) increase on the previous year) and 110 175 calls to switchboards in State and Territorycapitals and particular ABC programs and services (a 21% decrease). * Key concerns reflected in the audience contacts this year were the introduction of a 'NationalSports Wrap' on the 7.00 Television Newswhich generated 3 624 written and telephonecomplaints; the ending of the program Take the High Road which generated 3 473 complaints; and an episode of Play School that featured a segment in which a girl went to the amusementpark with her two mums. This episode wasthe subject of media attention which generated678 complaints and 1 131 supportive comments. Of the 47 132 complaints received, 2 290 were claims of party political or other bias, 553 allegedlack of balance and 1 448 were claims of factualinaccuracy. Over 600 of the complaints aboutfactual inaccuracy were the result of a campaignby honestreporting.com, a US group establishedto scrutinise the media for anti-Israeli bias, thatencouraged its subscribers to complain aboutan ABC News Online item reporting the deathof Palestinians in Nablus. The complaint wasnot upheld. Upheld complaints During 2003-04, 15 376 written complaintswere finalised, of which 376 (2.4%) wereupheld. All upheld complaints are brought to the attention of the senior editorial staffresponsible and corrective action is takenwhen appropriate. In 2003-04, actions takenin response to upheld complaints includedwritten apologies to on-air corrections and apologies; counselling or reprimanding of staff; adding consumer advice warnings to future broadcasts; removal of inappropriate content or correctionof material on ABC Online; and reviews of and improvements to procedures. All upheldcomplaints are reported in detail to the ABC Board. In January 2003, the ABC began publication of a quarterly Public Report on Audience Comments and Complaints , in order to increase transparency and accountability of the ABC complaints process. The reportprovides summaries of audience contacts andupheld program complaints finalised by ABCAudience and Consumer Affairs and the ABC's Complaints Review Executive.It is published on the ABC website. Timeliness As outlined in the ABC Editorial Policies , the ABC endeavours to respond to all audiencecontacts within 28 days. Between 1 July 2003and 30 June 2004, ABC Audience andConsumer Affairs responded directly to 22 294audience contacts. Of these, 16 673 (75%)received responses within 28 days. Complaints Review Executive In 2002, the ABC established the role ofComplaints Review Executive (CRE) to providean additional level of independent internalreview for complainants who express dissatisfaction with ABC Audience andConsumer Affairs' response to their complaint.The CRE has broad scope to review thebroadcast or publication in question and the manner with which the complainant was originally dealt, and determine whether theABC acted appropriately. The CRE is independent of both ABC Audience andConsumer Affairs and all program makers.Murray Green, who is also State Director ofVictoria, is the current CRE.28 Annual Report 2003-04 *Combined audience contacts received by Audience and Consumer Affairs, News and Current Affairs and the Reception Advice Line (p hone, letter and email).The additional tier of internal review does not preclude complainants from seeking externalreview through the Australian BroadcastingAuthority, or the Independent Complaints ReviewPanel, depending on the nature of the complaint. In the year to 30 June 2004 the CRE investigated 54 matters and adjudicated in one other matter.In eight cases the complaint was upheld eitherin part or in full. A summary of these determinations is reported quarterly on the ABC website. Independent Complaints Review Panel The Independent Complaints Review Panel (ICRP) is an independent body that reviewscomplaints about ABC broadcasts involvingserious bias, lack of balance or unfair treatment.Once a complaint has been considered underthe ABC's internal review system, complainantsmay write to the ICRP if they are dissatisfiedwith the ABC's response, or if the ABC has not responded to the complaint within sixweeks of the complaint being made. Members of the Panel are appointed by the ABC Board and have been selected for theirknowledge of, or experience in, journalisticethics and practice, media operations and program production, complaints handling and other review processes. The currentICRP Panellists are Ted Thomas (Convenor),Margaret Jones (Deputy Stepan Kerkyasharianand Bob Johnson. Reports of ICRP reviews are made public. The Managing Director carefully considersICRP findings and recommendations, andwhen required, takes appropriate action inresponse to the Panel's report.In the period 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004 the ICRP received 28 requests to reviewcomplaints, five of which were accepted forreview. The twenty-three remaining requestsinvolved matters outside the ICRP's area ofresponsibility. The ICRP upheld two of thecomplaints reviewed. Appendix 18 (page 172) provides details of matters reviewed by the ICRP and the decisions of the Panel. Australian Broadcasting Authority Members of the public who complain to the ABCabout matters covered by the Corporation'sCode of Practice and who are dissatisfied with the ABC's response or the handling of theircomplaint may seek review from the AustralianBroadcasting Authority (ABA). During 2003-04, the ABA finalised its investigations into 19 such matters (10 in2002-03). In 18 of these cases, the ABA'sinvestigation concluded that there had been no breach of the ABC's Code of Practice . The ABA concluded that the ABC had breachedits Code of Practice on one occasion, in relation to the content of a news update broadcastduring children's viewing time.section 2 29 Annual Report 2003-04every one's 30 Annual Report 2003-04 performancereviewspromoting the arts ideasthrough australian eyes Jaya Balendra TV Arts Producer Jaya Balendra is Series Producer on ABC Television's Critical Mass, a weekly program which complements the diverse range of artsand entertainment content across ABC Radio,Online, Enterprises and Television. 'Critical Mass is a program about ideas,' says Jaya, 'and should stimulate conversation and the ideaof picking up a book or going to an exhibition.' Each week host Jonathan Biggins and a guest panel review and analyse new performancework, books, films and exhibitions. Jaya has been working on ABC arts programming since 1997. The former newspaper and TV journalist explains, 'I've had a long-standing interest in the arts andI'm always interested in good storytelling so I'vebeen able to combine the two.

'It's like a Rubik's cube' she says.section 2 31 Annual Report 2003-04Corporate Governance Corporate governance processes in the ABC underwent further refinement during the year.Since 1999, the Board and management haveintroduced a number of significant reforms andimprovements to all areas of governance: strategysetting, policy management, performance andcompliance measurement, and external reporting and accountability processes. ABC Board The ABC Board held ten meetings during2003-04. Details of the six Board Committeesand Board Members' attendances at meetingsare provided in Appendix 4 (page 158). The Board continued to make active use of the committee system through regular processesof the Audit and Risk Committee, FinanceCommittee and ABC Advisory Council BoardCommittee. The Editorial Policies Committeeprovided oversight to a further review of theeffectiveness of ABC Editorial Policies . Having approved a major revision of Editorial Policies in 2002-03, the Board wished to ensure theiroperational relevance and effectiveness. Aspart of the recent review, the Editorial PoliciesCommittee considered proposed amendmentsto the ABC Code of Practice , a document required by legislation to be lodged with the Australian Broadcasting Authority. In accordance with better practice standards of governance, the Board developed an ABCDirectors' Handbook, including a Code of Ethics,which brought together and improved thestatements of principles and guidelines foreffective performance. The code is publishedon the Corporation's Internet site. Directorscompleted a questionnaire to assess thestrengths and weaknesses of the ABC's governance framework. When compared with a previous questionnaire, the resultsshowed perceived improvement across nearly every measure.Respected Board member, Mr Maurice Newman, AC, resigned at the end of June. In doing so, he expressed his concern about the circumstances surrounding an allegedbreach of Board confidentiality. Corporate Planning A new ABC Corporate Plan for the 2004-07period is scheduled to take effect from1 July 2004. In developing corporate strategy, the Managing Director convened four meetings ofkey executives to consider major opportunitiesand challenges, facilitated by an external consultant. The results of audience researchand internal strategic analysis helped to informthese meetings. ABC Board Director, Mrs LeithBoully, attended one of the executive meetingsand liaised with management during the corporate planning process. On 27 May, the Board held a facilitated planning day, which included presentations from twointernational media specialists: Mr David Lewis,Assistant Secretary-General of the EuropeanBroadcasting Union, and Mr John Paul, aUS-based consultant who had also worked in Australia. The Board considered the challenges associated with sustaining high levels of performance fromthe ABC's established television, radio and newmedia services, while also continuing to positionthe Corporation for the future. It acknowledgedthe importance of delivering quality programmingand content in ways appropriate to the changingrequirements of Australian audiences. It alsore-affirmed the importance of localism\u2014especially in relation to non-metropolitan communities\u2014as a point of differentiation for the national broadcaster.32 Annual Report 2003-04Finalisation of the 2004-07 Corporate Plan depended on the outcome of Governmentconsideration of the 2004-05 CommonwealthBudget, which included an ABC fundingrequest. The ABC Chairman wrote to theMinister advising that, although the newCorporate Plan would become effective on 1 July, it would not be completed for presentation to the Minister by that date. Annual Report Awards The ABC's Corporate Plan and its Annual Report constitute the two principal governance documents through which the Board acquitsits statutory obligations. The 2002-03 Annual Report received a Gold Award in the 2004 Australasian ReportingAwards in recognition of achieving the 'highestlevel of Excellence in Reporting'. The awardcitation said the ABC Annual Report focussed on goals that were clearly articulated and communicated. It provided comprehensiveinformation in a 'reader friendly and concisemanner throughout the report and isnoticeably well linked to the Corporate Plan'. Follow-up ANAO Review of Corporate Governance On 31 March, the Auditor-General tabled in Parliament a follow-up audit of Corporate Governance in the Australian BroadcastingCorporation (Australian National Audit Office Report No. 38, 2003-04). The ANAO examinedthe ABC's progress in implementing 14 recommendations made in the initial performanceaudit of governance in 2002 (Audit Report No. 40, 2001-02). It also examined the implementation progress of three related recommendations from the Parliament's Joint Committee on Public Accounts andAudit (JCPAA). The ANAO reported that the ABC had made 'considerable progress to address allrecommendations of the 2002 audit and theJCPAA report'. It found that nine of the 14 recommendations had been fully implementedor were on track for timely implementation,parts of the five remaining recommendationshad been fully implemented and the other part recommendations had been partiallyimplemented. In response to the findings, the ABC noted that the 14 recommendations consisted of 25 parts. According to the ANAO's assessment,the Corporation had fully implemented or wason track to implement 19 of these parts (76 per cent) and had partially implemented the remaining six. Other External Reviews In addition to the ANAO follow-up review of ABC corporate governance, the ANAOcommenced a review of the financial aspectsof the Corporation's conversion to digitalbroadcasting. This review was an extension of early ANAO reviews of the digital project.The report has not yet been completed. The Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (DCITA) undertook aperformance review of the ABC's NationalInterest Initiatives (NII) program. The ABC didnot receive a report on the outcome of thereview. However, the Government announced in the 2004-05 Federal Budget that it wouldextend NII funding until 2007-08. Details of these reviews are in Appendix 10 (page 162). ABC Editorial Policies and Code of Practice ABC Editorial Policies and the Code of Practice (see Appendix 20, page 173) include comprehensive information and advice for staffregarding standards required for the productionand presentation of all programming and content.This includes particular reference to those program standards embodied in legislation,section 2 33 Annual Report 2003-04Corporate Governance (continued) especially the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 . The Board receives twice-yearly reports on the operation of ABC Editorial Policies to monitor their effectiveness and identify matters that may require updatingor revision. Complaints Management The ANAO follow-up audit of ABC corporategovernance found that changes to the complaints management process in 2002'have significantly enhanced the managementof complaints at the ABC'. The audit reportcommented: 'Available comparative information suggests that the ABC complaints handling processis at least equal to processes of other majorpublic broadcasters around the world ... As is appropriate for a publicly fundedbroadcaster, the ABC is significantly moretransparent and comprehensive in complaintshandling and reporting than its commercialcounterparts.' All serious complaints received by the ABC are referred to the Audience and ConsumerAffairs unit of ABC Corporate Affairs. Theseinclude matters related to factual inaccuracy,lack of balance, bias or inappropriate content.Audience and Consumer Affairs is independentof ABC program departments and investigatesall written complaints relating to alleged breaches of ABC Editorial Policies , Code of Practice or the legislative Charter. A part-time Complaints Review Executive (CRE) is available to provide an additional levelof internal review for complainants. The CREhas broad scope to examine the broadcast inquestion, the manner in which the complaintwas originally dealt with by Audience andConsumer Affairs, and to determine whetherthe ABC acted properly. The CRE operatesindependently of both the Audience and Consumer Affairs unit and program makers;and all CRE findings are reported to the Board.Complainants may also seek external reviewvia the ABC's Independent Complaints ReviewPanel (ICRP) or the Australian BroadcastingAuthority (ABA). A summary of complaints dealt with by the ABC in 2003-04 appears in AudienceContacts (page 27). Governance Reporting Monthly Governance Reports to the Boardfrom individual Executive Directors affirm thatDivisions have adhered to all governancerequirements (including legislative obligations)and/or identify breaches and issues of concern.Executive Directors in charge of media outputor program Divisions are required specifically to address adherence to Editorial Policies , including matters of independence, accuracyand impartiality. International Benchmarking The ABC continues to perform efficiently compared with the average performance of the International Benchmarking Group of eight national public broadcasters. Current members of the group are the ABC, Radio New Zealand, the BBC (UK), CBC(Canada), DR (Denmark), NRK (Norway), RTE(Ireland) and ORF (Austria). Each broadcastercompiles performance information using common criteria. The ABC hosts the data onbehalf of the group. The latest results, basedon 2002-03 data, show that in general theABC is, and has remained, comparatively efficient relative to the average performanceof the benchmarking group. The next stage of the process is to analyse the data, taking intoaccount the different operational environmentsin which the group members operate.34 Annual Report 2003-04section 2 35 Annual Report 2003-04 Fraud Control Plan The Corporation updated its Fraud Control Plan to ensure it continued to meet the requirementsof the Commonwealth Fraud Control Guidelines.An external firm assessed ABC fraud controlstrategies against recognised better practice,finding the strategy to be 'highly effective' andexisting fraud control efforts to be 'excellent'. Internal Performance and Compliance Reviews The Board Audit and Risk Committee approved a new three-year Audit Plan for 2004-07,developed in a process of consultation withmore than 100 staff across the Corporation. During 2003-04, ABC Group Audit commissioned or undertook six InformationTechnology audits, commenced 24 complianceaudits (of which 15 were completed by 30 June2004) and 21 comprehensive, operational andconsulting reviews (of which 14 were completedby 30 June). These latter reviews examinedinternal controls and compliance with ABCpolicies and procedures, efficiency, effectivenessand the value for money provided through the activities concerned. Further details are in Appendix 5 (page 159). Occupational Health and Safety The ABC is working cooperatively with Comcare in reviewing systems of Occupational Health andSafety management. Recent Comcare auditsof plant and equipment management systemsin all states (excluding the Northern Territoryand the ACT) indicated a generally good levelof compliance across these areas of activity.Comcare recommended that the ABC introducea plant and equipment policy and proceduresdocument, and a plant compliance review andreporting process. The ABC is taking steps to implement these recommendations. Further details are in Appendix 12 (page 163).$33 993 HourThe Corporation's annual workers compensation premium increased by 63% to $1.98 million in2003-04, reflecting both general rises in thecost of claims across Commonwealth agenciesand the increased incidence of claims, especiallyrelating to psychological injuries. However,Comcare provided the ABC with a rebate of$204 000 in recognition of the Corporation'seffective case management that reduced the expected costs of claims. Management Structure The Managing Director continued to examineDivisional arrangements to ensure that functionalstructures were appropriate to the ABC'sevolving needs. On 1 July 2003, ABC Enterprises commenced operating in an expanded Divisional form,becoming responsible for all revenue-generatingactivities that were previously located in different areas. Following a review process and staff consultation, the Corporation re-aligned a number of functionsfrom the Technology and Distribution Divisionto several other Divisions, especially ProductionResources. The broad aims of this proposedre-alignment were to: improve functionalaccountability, improve the ABC's on-air performance, re-focus the Corporation's technology strategy function, and deliver efficiency benefits. The Managing Director chairs fortnightly meetings of the Executive, reverting to this frequencyafter a period in which it met on a monthlybasis. In addition, relevant sub-groups ofExecutive Directors attend fortnightly meetingsof the Content Group and Operations Group. Other senior management committees that provide inter-Divisional coordination include: International Broadcasting Board of Management\u2014chaired by the ManagingDirector, providing oversight to the operationsof Radio Australia and ABC Asia Pacific; Enterprises Board of Management\u2014chaired by the Director of Enterprises; Capital Planning Committee\u2014chaired by the Director of Business Services. Strategic Support A number of specialist units exist to supportthe Board and Executive Management in corporate positioning and governance. The Corporate Planning and Governance unit, situated in the Corporate Affairs Division,coordinates corporate and divisional planningprocesses, corporate performance reporting,industry analysis and corporate policy. TheCorporate Marketing unit is responsible for the development and coordination of theABC's overall brand management. Within the Business Services Division, the Business Performance Measurement unit collates and analyses information for use in a wide range of key performance indicators at corporate and divisional level; and theBusiness Review and Development unit providesfeasibility assessment of opportunities, projectplanning and implementation and businessreview of existing activities. Reporting on Ecologically Sustainable Development The Corporation is in the process of ensuring full compliance with the requirements of section516A of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (refer Appendix 16, page 167).36 Annual Report 2003-04 Corporate Governance (continued)section 2 37 Annual Report 2003-04 Financial Outcome 2003-04 Consistent with previous years, the ABC operated within its total sources of funds and Government appropriations for the 2003-04 financial year. Sources of Funds 2003-04 The ABC was appropriated $742.6m in the May2003 Federal Budget. In the CommonwealthBudget Additional Estimates process inFebruary 2004, the ABC was provided additionalspecific-purpose funding, bringing the totalappropriation for 2003-04 to $746.9m. Apartfrom for the ABC's core activities,Government Appropriation for 2003-04 includedfunding for digital and analog transmission, andborrowings to fund major capital expenditureson retirement of maturing debt. The ABC alsoreceived some $153.7m from other sources,including ABC Enterprises. The Chart 'ABC Source of Funds' depicts ABC's budgeted funds for the various categoriesagainst actual sources for 2003-04 and itsbudgeted sources for 2004-05. Application of Funds After the ABC failed to secure additional funding from the Federal Budget in May 2003,the approved 2003-04 Budget Strategyencompassed cuts to program and non-program functions to bridge a recurrent funding gap of some $26m. The chart 'Split Actual Expenditure 2003-04' broadly represents the ABC's application of fundsby function for the 2003-04 financial year. The Year Ahead Appropriation The 2004-05 Federal Budget provided for base funding to be increased with an additionof $4.2m for acquisitions, and confirmed the continuation of National Interest Initiatives fundinguntil the end of 2007-08. The ABC's comparativefunding for the 2004-05 Financial Year is: $m Total Appropriation perOutcomes 1, 2 and 3 756.1Less Analogue Transmission Funding -78.6Less Digital Transmission Funding -63.4Less Capital Use Charge Tied Funding 0.0Less Loan Funds 0.0Total Comparative Appropriation Funds 614.1 The chart 'Appropriation by Output 2004-05' depicts the Corporation's split of its 2004-05appropriation by outputs. This split incorporatesa notional attribution of corporate and support areas. Budget Strategy The Corporation will continue to work towardthe formulation of a ten-year capital fundingstrategy to address increasing pressure on theCorporation's capital budgets. With this aim in mind, in August 2003 the Board's FinanceCommittee endorsed an approach to developthree strategies encompassing informationtechnology (IT), technology and property. TheABC's IT Strategy was completed and approvedby the Board in March 2004 and the completionof the technology and property strategies areexpected during the 2004-05 year. Comparative Appropriation The 2004-05 operational funds of $614.1m represents a decrease in real funding of$254.02m or 29.3% since 1985-86 asdepicted in the chart 'ABC OperationalAppropriation'.Financial Summary38 Annual Report 2003-04 ABC Source of Funds 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 General Appropriation IndependentAnalog Transmissions Digital Transmissions Digital Capital Asia Pacific Grant Enterprises Revenue Other Revenue$ millions Government Funding 2003-04 Budget 2003-04 Actual 2004-05 Budget Split Actual Expenditure 8%Analog 10%New 2% Television Other 17% Support Services 8% Transmission 21% Television Programs Produced (including News, Current Affairs and Captioning) 28%Acquisi tions 5%Radio Broadcast (including News and Current Affairs) 19% New Media 2%Financial Summary (continued)section 2 39 2004 2003 2002 2001 Recast 2000 ABC Operating $'000 $'000 $'000 147 720 938 673 447 Operating Revenue 153 712 146 299 148 334 113 573 108 986 Net Cost of Services (a) 705 016 676 557 632 813 607 365 564 461 Revenue from Government 726 895 733 469 710 565 622 921 599 158 2004 2003 2002 2001 Recast 2000 Financial Position $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 $'000 Current Assets 197 602 214 501 184 949 161 763 166 072 Non-Current Assets 824 884 744 564 694 941 653 796 646 705 Total Assets 1 022 486 959 065 879 890 815 559 812 777 Current Liabilities 125 672 209 282 178 751 126 334 180 467 Non-Current Liabilities 208 599 218 673 208 607 229 604 134 892 Total Liabilities 334 271 427 955 387 358 355 938 315 359 Total Equity 688 215 531 110 492 532 459 621 497 418 Ratios Current Ratio (b) 1.57 1.02 0.92 Equity (c) 67% 55% 56% 56% 61% (a) Net cost of services is cost of services less operating revenue.

Corporate Objectives acknowledge the balance of effort between competition for audiences\u2014the relevance and appeal of ABC services\u2014and the distinctiveness of programming andcontent required by the Charter. In this, the last year of this Corporate Plan, the ABC achieved 80% of its performance targets.It fully achieved 72 of the 90 targets and partiallyachieved a further 10. The Corporation failedto meet only eight of the 90 targets. A more detailed summary of the ABC's Corporate Plan performance is provided inPerformance Against ABC Corporate Plan 2001-04 (page 96). Objective 1 Relevance and Appeal Build and retain audience share and reach through multi-platform programming and content that is appreciated by a broad range of communities of interest and need. As reported elsewhere in this report, community support for the ABC remains very high\u201489%of Newspoll respondents believe the nationalbroadcaster provides a valuable service to thecommunity, and half (48%) believe it provides a 'very valuable' service. This support flowedthrough to record and near-record audiencesfor ABC services across television, radio andnew media outputs. Overall audience shareremained strong with both television and radiorecording increases against results of the previous year. The overall weekly audiencereach of ABC Radio increased while ABC Television remained steady, as it has done forthe past two years. However, the reach of ABCTelevision again declined slightly in percentileterms in a slowly contracting free-to-air market.ABC Online continued its year-on-year growthin reach and numbers of users. Objective 2 Distinctiveness Enable audiences to be informed, educated andengaged with the challenges of contemporarylife and with one another, through distinctiveinformation, cultural and children's programmingand content. The distinctiveness of ABC programs and services is demonstrated through qualitiessuch as its genre mix, spread of servicesthroughout Australia and internationally, leveland mix of Australian content, and recognitionthrough awards and peer review. Eighty-threeper cent of Newspoll respondents believe theABC does a good job in being distinctivelyAustralian and contributing to national identity. The Corporation extended further its regionalradio services with the opening of its 60th localradio station in Erina, New South Wales.Collocated with the Central Coast's ABC Shop,the station provides an additional 780 hours oflocal programming per year. Internationally theCorporation continued to extend its presenceand profile in the region. Radio Australiaincreased its shortwave transmissions by 15% to 200 hours per day and ABC AsiaPacific is now received in 32 countries acrossthe Asia Pacific region. At home, ABCTelevision reported a decline of 4% to 48% in the level of Australian content broadcastbetween 6am and midnight. Availableresources were concentrated on themaintenance of Australian content in eveningprime time between 6pm and midnight. section 2 41 Annual Report 2003-04 Objective 3 Organisational Capability Ensure effective alignment of the Charter, strategic aims and activities of the Corporationas an independent national broadcaster throughits governance, management and commitmentto a skilled and flexible workforce. The ABC's commitment to the ongoing improvement of its corporate governance systems and processes continued through the final year of the Corporate Plan 2001-04 . In October 2003, the ABC published its firstPublic Report on Audience Comments and Complaints. Made available quarterly, the Reportprovides a summary of the composition ofaudience contacts, the timeliness of the ABC'sresponses, the subject matter of complaintsand the number that were upheld. Eighty percent of Newspoll respondents believed the ABCwas balanced and even handed, a slight fall of1% on the previous year's result.Objective 4 Value for Money Achieve access to adequate funding, supportedby continued improvement in the measurableefficiency and effectiveness of resource utilisation. In 2003-04 the Federal Government provided a further $4.2 million per annum to the ABC'sbase funding, for program purchases, inacknowledgement of the rising cost of acquisitions internationally and in Australia.Annual Appropriation provided under theNational Interest Initiatives funding was alsoconfirmed through until the end of 2007-08,benefiting program output across the Corporationand in particular, services to regional and ruralaudiences. The ABC continued to host an information repository on behalf of the eight-member International BenchmarkingGroup of public broadcasters.

Workshops included leadership, theeffectiveness of bi-media newsrooms aroundthe country and the potential of such to achievegreater efficiencies. Twelve Executive Producersand other senior staff are taking part in a management development program; twomembers of the Division's executive and twoState Editors participated in a pilot seniorexecutive development program run by theAustralian Graduate School of Management;and Production Managers attended a two-daytraining workshop in Adelaide in October.These development programs followed a successful three-day forum for women who have the potential to move into leadership roles. To ensure greater accountability, the Division has entered into Service Level Agreements or Arrangements with all output areas.These agreements set out the programmingrequirements of the networks and the agreedprocesses in News and Current Affairs tomeet these requirements, as well as a range of mutual obligations. The agreements areexpected to be reviewed annually. News and Current Affairs has a range of mechanisms to ensure programs are meetingexpectations of integrity and quality. All programsare subjected to regular formal reviews whichconsider story choice, talent, production, presentation, writing and adherence to program briefs, ABC Editorial Policies and the Style Guide . The reviews generally involvesenior management, executive producers and representatives from the network on which theprogram is broadcast. In addition to formalreviews, output is monitored on a daily basisand there are occasional reviews of coverageacross programs of particular topics, such as sport or business. All program-making staff in News and Current Affairs have copies of the revised News andCurrent Affairs Style Guide . This advises on language, presentation and production. Resources and Efficiencies To meet budget targets the Division made certain adjustments to programs and otherareas of activity. The resources of Business Breakfast andWorld at Noon were combined to create a new program, Midday News and Business . Some state-based weekend afternoon and evening radio news bulletins,produced in capital cities around the country,were replaced with national bulletins producedfrom the newsrooms in Adelaide and Perth. The annual journalism cadetship intake was suspended and a two-year program of attritionand expense cuts was imposed across allareas of local, national and international coverage and management. In international operations, the Brussels bureau was closed, with some of the savingsfrom this closure used to augment Europe coverage from the London bureau. A correspondent's position in China was alsoabolished. Despite the reductions, the ABCremains the best-represented Australian media organisation overseas. Field video store-and-forward technology has been further developed and expanded. This60 Annual Report 2003-04system employs a satellite phone connection to a laptop, allowing crews in the field to fileedited television packages at significantly lower cost and with greater convenience thantraditional satellite feeds. First used by ABCreporters to file footage during the Iraq war, it is now used widely overseas on a variety of assignments and has also been useddomestically. The Division is trialling an Internet system which allows free calls between London and Sydneyover a broadband link. This is likely to beextended to the other overseas bureaux.

This makes theservice unique amongst the internationalbroadcasting community. This programmingstrategy has played an important role in therapid take-up of the service. During the past year, ABC Asia Pacific substantially redesigned and upgraded its program schedule to better meet audience and pay operator expectations and demands.All programs shown are high quality, up-to-dateand recently produced. The news, currentaffairs and information programs aim to becredible and independent. The channel is committed to showcasing the best ofAustralian television by broadcasting a minimum 60% Australian content. During 2003-04, 75% of the schedule was Australian content. The nightly prime time programming line-up is built on four main strands: ABC news and current affairs produced for the Asia Pacific region; a quality Australian or international drama series; a world class documentary; and an informative and entertaining feature or lifestyle program. Another significant programming strategy includes transmitting education programs ofreal benefit to audiences across the region.Feedback through the ABC Asia Pacific website suggests that such programming, in particular English learning content, is extremely popular.Australian sports coverage was extensive, with seven games of AFL or NRL broadcast everyweek of the football season, as well as coverageof the Victorian Spring racing carnival, with theMelbourne Cup as the highlight. Some of the programs that proved most successful were: 36 ABC Asia Pacific half-hour news programs each week; Australian dramas such as The Shark Net, Blue Healers and MDA ; International dramas such as Forsyth Saga ,State of Play and Frost; Documentaries on a wide range of issues and from differing perspectives; and Australian information programs such as RPA, Getaway, Catalyst, The New Inventorsand Enough Rope with Andrew Denton.

The previousfacility consisted of six ageing buildings unsuitableto meet the Corporation's current and futureoperational requirements. The scatteredarrangement of the buildings made it difficult to achieve effective working relationshipsbetween operational units, and electrical andmechanical services were generally dilapidatedand in need of replacement. The new premises have been designed to meet the current and future accommodation,program and technical support needs of thebranch. To improve work practices, workareas have been collocated where appropriateand staff located in closer proximity to eachother and the studio facilities that they use.The project also focused on the upgrade of technical infrastructure, in particular the digitisation of television news equipment andthe digitisation and collocation of radio andtelevision central equipment rooms. Construction for the refurbishment of the Canberra premises commenced on 1 May 2002and was completed on 28 November 2003.

During 2003-04, the Division continued to install digital production equipment and extend theABC's digital television transmission services,as well as completing technical fit-outs for a number of significant ABC propertydevelopments. New radio and television studio facilities were completed in Canberra, including an upgradedtelevision control room to allow the reintroductionof local Television News bulletins. This projectrequired the creation of temporary radio studiosand the use of an outside broadcast (OB) vanto produce the News while the existing workareas were refurbished. A key outcome of theredevelopment was the relocation of technicalmaintenance and transmission activities tolocations combining radio and television functions. Canberra is the first site to have a single Content Distribution Centre thatincorporates Radio and Television MasterControl Room functions and TelevisionPresentation in a single work space. These redesigned areas are aimed at improving working relationships with the introduction of newtechnology, as well as addressing complianceissues of fire safety, security and disabled access. The technical fit-out of three new regional studios was completed during the year. The 97.3 ABCIllawarra facility at Nowra was relocated to moresuitable premises within the town and the mainstudios for the ABC Mid North Coast servicewere moved from Kempsey to the growingregional centre of Port Macquarie. The newPort Macquarie studio features state-of-the-arttechnology, including digital on-air broadcastconsoles. In January 2004, the new studios for92.5 ABC Central Coast opened at Erina inGosford, New South Wales. These innovativestudios are incorporated into the main regionalshopping centre and are highly visible to the public. In accordance with legislative requirements, the ABC commenced broadcasts of High DefinitionTelevision (HDTV) on 29 August 2003.

The digital conversion of the ABC's production and transmission facilities continued throughoutthe year. All capital cities now have widescreencapable OB vehicles, with the deployment ofthe remaining digital television OB vans forSydney, Melbourne and Canberra and deliveryof a refurbished van to Darwin. During 2003-04, the ABC's satellite-based television interchange system, which providesthe national distribution of television programmaterial between all states, was upgraded tomeet the demands of a multi-channel digitaltelevision environment. The new systembegan operations on 26 November 2003 andprovides higher-quality vision and audio circuitsand greater operational flexibility. In addition, it has enabled 12 regional centres to uplinkand transfer video content to the televisioninterchange network, resulting in savings fromreduced itinerant satellite transponder hire. The ABC is progressively rolling out a new radio switching system to replace the existingageing hardware, for which spare parts arenow unobtainable. The introduction of thissystem is a major step towards the digitisationof the radio production process, integrating on-air studios and signal routing in one cohesivedigital platform. The new radio switchers allowthe automated incorporation of audio contentfrom a variety of sources, including newssegments and outside broadcast feeds, into a single program stream, and are capable of exceeding current program switchingrequirements by 25% or more. The systemhas already been deployed in Canberra andwas commissioned in June 2004 for thenational radio network hub in Ultimo.In April 2004, the ABC began trial transmissions of an interactive electronic program guide (EPG)on ABC digital channel 22 in Sydney. The EPGwas developed by the Technology Researchand Development group and provides viewerswith regularly updated program details up to a week ahead. In addition, the ABC has participated with other broadcasters in thedevelopment of the specification and standardsnecessary for a common EPG that carries all of the networks' program details. The serviceon ABC channel 22 currently carries informationfrom two other broadcasters, but it is anticipatedother broadcasters will participate in future. The ABC has been an active participant in two digital radio broadcasting trials on VHF Band IIIChannel 9A which commenced during theyear, providing the digInternet radio service and ABC Classic FM for both trials. In Sydney,the DR2000 L-Band trial incorporating the ABCClassic FM service is continuing, providing participants with the opportunity to test anddirectly compare the capabilities of the L-Bandand Band III services. In Melbourne, the ABC is also trialling the use of data exchange technologies including the transmission of dig website information (such as current song titleand artist) for display on digital radio receivers. Interior of one of the ABC's new digital outside broadcast vans.Archives Project Preservation of the ABC's unique audio and video media archive is a key component of the Corporation's digitisation strategy. In July2003, a contract was awarded to implement a digital archive solution for the ABC to store,manage and preserve content and to convertover 60 000 hours of analog archive contentinto digital form over a three-year period. The system has been installed at the Ultimosite and is being tested prior to commissioning.Once fully implemented, this will ensure a sustainable, robust system for the futurepreservation and online access of ABCaudio and video archives. Broadband A year-long project to upgrade the BrisbaneNew Media and Digital Services broadbandfacilities was completed in March 2004. Theupgrade has enabled the ABC to explore arange of emerging distribution opportunities,and the production and delivery of morebroadband program content and services via the Internet. It has also enabled the introduction of redundant equipment tominimise the impact of primary equipment failure on broadband audiences. IT Infrastructure and Applications During the year, the Information Technology (IT) group completed an upgrade of the networklinks between capital city sites (as well asNewcastle and Launceston) to a modern ATM(Asynchronous Transfer Mode) system. Thenew system allows for much faster informationsharing between sites, as well as sharingaudio, voice and, potentially, video over thesame capacity. It also provides for more flexiblenetwork management and provides a solidfoundation for future network growth without the constant replacement of expensiveinfrastructure components. A standardised and centralised disc storage infrastructure has also been implemented acrossall capital cities, allowing for cost-effective storage management. The infrastructure hasbeen designed to accommodate storagerequirement growth over the next five years,minimising storage expenditure over that period. Technical Project Management During 2003-04, the Technology Project Office continued to oversee and assist in theimplementation of capital projects, co-ordinateproject status reporting and promoteDivision-wide pr oject management disciplines. More than one hundred Divisional staff havereceived training in the new project managementmethodology and tools and are applying thesein daily work. Work is underway to extend project management training to ABC internalcustomers to ensure a common approachacross the Corporation. Technology and Distribution Realignment Following the conclusion of the conversion of the ABC's core broadcasting facilities to digital,and the transfer of television production fromGore Hill to Ultimo in Sydney, the Division commenced a realignment process. Staffinvolved in operational roles in transmissionwere transferred to Production Resources,while the internal Divisional realignment gaveenhanced focus to: service and support forABC technologies; management of new ABCtechnology projects; management of contractswith external technology and communicationsservices providers; and developing agreedtechnology strategies for the ABC.Technology and Distribution90 Annual Report 2003-04 (continued)section 3 91 Annual Report 2003-04 Technical Training Over 11 000 hours of technical training were delivered to Divisional staff during the year,comprising more than 4 000 hours of technicaltraining, 3 000 hours of IT software and systemstraining, and nearly 2 000 hours each of ProjectManagement and Occupational Health andSafety (OH&S) training. As well as the on-goingtraining of staff in new technology, there were asignificant number of re-certification programsfor technical staff who maintain a wide range of digital television, radio and transmissionequipment. The strong focus on OH&S trainingthis year included attendance at coursesrelating to the Radiofrequency Safety project,which is ensuring compliance with newAustralian Communication Authority (ACA) regulations and the Australian RadiationProtection and Nuclear Safety Agency(ARPANSA) standard. Government and Regulatory Issues The ABC's technical interests were represented at national bodies such as theInternational Radio Advisory Committee (IRAC)and international bodies including the Asia-PacificBroadcasting Union (ABU) and the InternationalTelecommunications Union (ITU). During the year, the Corporation worked with the other free-to-air broadcasters on a range of common technical issues, and has beenactively involved in industry consultations with Commercial Television Australia (CTVA),Commercial Radio Australia (CRA) and thecommunity broadcasting sector. Other consultations on a range of technicalissues have involved the ACA (AustralianCommunications Authority), ABA (AustralianBroadcasting Authority), Department ofCommunications, Information Technology and the Arts (DCITA), ACIF (AustralianCommunications Industry Forum), and WTF (Wireless Technology Forum).Transmission The ABC manages analog and digital transmission contracts in excess of $108 million per annum with transmission service providers Broadcast Australia. Transmission Fault Restoration During 2003-04, the average time for restoration of service after a transmission fault was 15.89minutes (15.17 minutes in 2002-03) for A-Classtransmitters (state capital works) and 42.01minutes (39.14 minutes in 2002-03) for B-Classtransmitters (major regional centres). Thedecrease in performance reflects the impact ofthe continued roll-out of new digital televisionservices to major regional centres and theassociated installation of improved monitoringequipment at transmission sites throughout the year. New Analog Services The ABC's minor extension program establishedthe following new services in 2003-04: LocalRadio in Port Stephens, New South Wales;Radio National in Port Stephens, New SouthWales and Horsham, Victoria; and analog television at Northam, Western Australia. In June 2004, the ABC reconfigured the Northern Territory Remote Area BroadcastService (RABS) to provide two distinct regionalradio services: a southern service with a centralAustralian flavour from Alice Springs feedingABC transmitters south of Newcastle Waters,and a northern signal from Darwin feedingtransmitters in the north and providing residentsin that part of the Territory with a more relevantLocal Radio service. The new service waslaunched with outside broadcasts from AliceSprings and Nhulunbuy on 25 June. Also in June 2004, the ABC Board committed to continuing the High Frequency domesticshower services providing Local Radio to remoteareas in the Northern Territory until at least 2009.This commitment will ensure that Broadcast Australia upgrades the facility to improve transmission performance levels and provide a more reliable service to audiences. New Digital Television Services In 2003-04, the ABC commenced digital television in 48 locations, continuing to providethe largest terrestrial coverage of all Australianbroadcasters. New services were established at: New South Wales: Armidale, Bay, Adelaide Foothills, Renmark/Loxton, South East, Spencer Gulf North and Victor Harbor. Tasmania: Hobart NE Suburbs, Launceston and Central Agricultural, Geraldton, Kalgoorlie, Manjimupand Southern Agricultural. To accommodate the introduction of digital television, the ABC's analog television services inCooktown, Miriam Vale, Mossman, Ravenshoeand Tully Queensland; and Taroona in Tasmania were requiredto change channel.92 Annual Report 2003-04 Technology and Distribution (continued) In 2003-04, the ABC commenced digital television broadcasts in 48 new locations.section 3 93 Annual Report 2003-04 ABC Distribution and Transmission Network Aggregated 2003-04 Performance as Reported by Broadcast Australia ABC Service No. of ABC Distribution Broadcast Australia Total 'On-Air' Transmitters Network Transmission Network Availability (See Note 1) (See Note 2) (See Note 3) 2003-04 2002-03 Target 2003-04 2002-03 2003-04 99.87 99.15 99.78 State (Analog 99.91 99.73 99.80 99.82 99.82 99.79 Notes: 1. ABC Distribution Network (included contracted service providers): The ABC distribution network ensures that programs are delivered from the studio to local transmitters throughout the Australia. The network includes outsourced satellite and te rrestrial broadcast distribution services from telecommunications carriers such as Optus and Telstra. This measure has been designed to be consistent with the contracted transmission targets and represents the aggregated performance of the more than 60 agreements the ABC has in place to distribute programs. The ABC's performance in this area improved over the previous year. Note: Local Radio, serving remote and regional Australia, is reliant on non-redundant Telstra broadcast lines. These performed as expected in 2003-04. 2. Broadcast Australia Transmission Network (ABC Transmission Contractor): The reported transmission network performance, provided by Broadcast Australia, was above the contracted performance targets but continued to reflect declining performance re lative to corresponding periods in the previous two years. The performance was affected by the continued roll-out of new digital tele vision services and the associated installation of improved monitoring equipment at transmission sites throughout the year. The new digital television services are performing above the agreed performance targets. 3. Total \"On-Air\" Availability: The total 'On-Air' availability shows the availability of a radio or television service, regardless of quality or coverage where some level of service continued to be provided throughout periods of on-air faults and diminished power levels d ue to maintenance. It is the time where there was no total loss or denial of service to the majority of the audience. This measure shows that Broadcast Australia reported an overall increase in the total period when services were 'off', in comparison to the previous ye ar. Digital television performance was significantly lower for this financial year. through australian eyes Alan Marks Special Events Unit Co-ordinatorSince Alan Marks joined the ABC in 1963 he has co-ordinated coverage of eight OlympicGames as well as a number of Commonwealthand Asian Games. 'My job,' he says, 'is to make the job of broadcasters at Games as easy as possible. We spend many years planning so that everythingdovetails\u2014accreditation, accommodation,rostering, technology\u2014all worked out beforehandso that basically the team gets off the plane,goes to the village, then does the job.' The ABC's three-person Special Events Unit evolved from the Olympic operations Unitwhich was set up for the Sydney Olympics. Itwas clear that there was an on-going need forthe accumulated experience of this group. Heading the unit at sporting events has its pros and cons for Alan. 'Because of the natureof the work you don't get much opportunity toactually enjoy the fun. When I was doing morebroadcast than production I could go out at the end of the day with my mates and teammembers. Now it's full on preparing for the next day. However, the most gratifying part of the whole lot is taking something from conceptual stage through to execution.' Alan has seen a lot of changes over the years but 'changing technology has obviously beenthe biggest. Our equipment is now so muchmore compact.' The International Olympic Committee recognised Alan Marks' contribution over the years when itselected him to be a torchbearer in the Sydneyleg of the Athens Olympic Torch Relay.94 Annual Report 2003-04every one's bringing australians together wide appealsection 4 95 Annual Report 2003-04 entertainmentcompetitionPerformance Against ABCCorporate Plan 2001-04 The ABC Corporate Plan 2001-04 sets out 90 individual targets. These targets are a combination of actions to be achieved byspecific dates, as well as year-on-year aims. In this, the last year of the Plan, a full reportagainst all targets has been provided,including those that were achieved in the early years of the Plan. At 30 June 2004, the Corporation had fully achieved 72 (80%) of the targets. Of theremaining 18 targets, 10 were partiallyachieved and eight had not been achieved.

Ongoing improvement in the coordination of ABC telephone contact points across Australia.Partially Achieved. Enhancements were made to the complaints handling process in August2002. All serious complaints received by theABC are referred to Audience and ConsumerAffairs for investigation and response. This unitis independent of program areas. Plans for theestablishment of a national call centre to providea single point of contact for audiences havenot proceeded due to a lack of funding. Progressive implementation of a national database to log details of audience contact,including letters, e-mails and telephone callsfor completion by July 2002.Achieved. Resource constraints resulted in this work being delayed until 2003-04.A Request for Proposal was released in March2003 and the new system was implementedon 1 July 2004. By July 2002 develop and bring online an Internet site to fully address audience inquiries,including frequently asked questions.Achieved. Maintain and aspire to year-on-year improvement in television audience reach and share.Partially Achieved. The ABC's share of free-to-air television audiences in 2003-04increased in both metropolitan (up 1.2% to17.3%) and regional Australia (up 0.7% to18.3%) compared to 2002-03. Weekly reach in metropolitan Australia remained steady at8.9 million viewers. When expressed as a 96 Annual Report 2003-04percentage of population reach was 65.7%, a slight decrease of 0.8% on the previous year.In regional Australia, the network achievedweekly reach of 4.0 million or 65.1% of thepopulation. This represented a slight declinefrom 4.1 million or 68% in the previous year. Establish and maintain attitudinal-based benchmarks for ongoing comparative assessment.Achieved. ABC Kids and Fly on-air by November 2001, such channels to be available on all platforms.Achieved (Services terminated as of 30 June 2003). Evaluate longer-term opportunities for digital multi-channels.Achieved. Maintain at 2000-01 levels and aspire to improve radio audience share and reach per station, per metropolitan market andtotal for all domestic networks.Achieved. By January 2003 radio audience reach and share benchmarks will be established in eachof the radio markets surveyed and for whichnew audience research data is available.Not Achieved. The infrequency of regional surveys and the fluctuating nature of the markets,including transmission issues, make bench-marking of these markets inappropriate.Research is unable to be translated from one survey period to the next. ABC Radio remains committed to maintaining and building regional audiences by developingan understanding of community interests andneeds through ongoing local participation,research and feedback, includingcommissioning focus group research. In late 2003, the ABC participated in surveys jointly with commercial radio stations on theGold Coast and in Wollongong. Early in 2004,the ABC formulated a regional radio survey schedule. Nielsen Media Research was thencommissioned to conduct diary surveys in anumber of regional areas. In the first half of2004 surveys were conducted in Albany, MtGambier and Orange. In the second half of the year surveys have been commissioned forKatherine, Bunbury, Wagin and Launceston.The ABC will also be participating in surveyscommissioned jointly with commercial stationsin Wollongong and Toowoomba. To supplement the quantitative data derived from these surveys ABC Local Radio alsoundertook qualitative research in 2003-04 in the Gold Coast/Tweed region. Thisresearch involved in-depth discussiongroups and face-to-face interviews. In March 2004, ABC Local Radio commenced a longitudinal research project exploring howlisteners feel about the world around them andthe place of the media, specifically radio andLocal Radio, in providing programming contentand tone which best reflects their needs andaspirations. The findings from the study, duefor completion in August 2004, will provide aframework for the strategic direction of ABCLocal Radio. This research was conducted in metropolitan and regional areas. In-depth discussion groupswere conducted in three metropolitan marketsand in Albury-Wodonga. Interactive researchdiscussions were conducted via the Internetamong a sample of Local Radio listeners acrossregional and metropolitan Australia. The regionalsample included Local Radio listeners fromNew South Wales (the Riverina and Broken Hill);Victoria (Goulburn-Murray and Central Victoria);Queensland (Southern Queensland and TropicalNorth); South Australia (Eyre Peninsula andWest Coast; South East and the Riverland); and Western Australia (South West andGoldfields/Esperance).section 4 97 Annual Report 2003-04For the remaining year of the plan, radio audience reach and share levels achieved inregional markets in 2003, will, at a minimum,be maintained.Not Achieved See above.

Performance indicators Quality 1. Australian content on RadioABC Radio's content, across its five domesticservices, is primarily Australian with the exceptionof ABC NewsRadio, which broadcasts 45% ofoverseas content including BBC World Service,Deutsche Welle, Radio Netherlands and All Things Considered from National Public Radio in the USA. Through the Regional Production Fund, approximately 233 hours of A ustralian content from external producers in regional Australiawas broadcast across ABC Radio networksand on ABC Online. This is compared to 135 hours in 2002-03. Radio National's weekly Australian drama program Airplay reached its target of 75% original (non-repeat) Australian content inDecember 2002, compared to 50% originalcontent at the commencement of the 2002program year. This target was maintained during 2003-04. All radio networks that broadcast music have a strong commitment to Australian musicand have set targets which are consistentlymet or exceeded. Australian Music Target Achievement 2003-04 2002 In 2003-04, ABC Classic FM achieved 11% Australian composition, compared to 12%achieved in 2002-03.

Genre Diversity See Appendix 2 (page 156). 3. Community and Peer Recognition See the summary of the 2004 Newspoll ABC Audience Appreciation Survey (page 24) and Appendix 22 (page 177). 4. Number of artists first broadcast The difficulty of maintaining records acrossmultiple outlets throughout Australia has madethis an impractical indicator to measure forABC Radio. However, commitment to newartists remains very strong as reflected in thesection 4 105 Annual Report 2003-04following initiatives undertaken in 2003-04: triple j 'sunearthed initiative in the Northern Territory, New South Wales and Queensland, in which winners supported high profile local bands in concerts in each capital city.Performances from the winning bands werealso broadcast live on triple j 's Australian music program Home & Hosed. In its second year, Fresh Air (a Regional Production Fund project) invited unsigned,unpublished artists to submit their music. Over 650 entries were received, many ofwhich were played on the artists' local ABCstation and 12 tracks selected for rotation onABC Local Radio's playlist. A series of liveFresh Air concerts featuring the successful artists is planned across regional Australia. The first two concerts were held at PortMacquarie and Bundaberg this year. Another Regional Production Fund project, Short Stories 2004, called for regionally-based writers to submit unpublished works with winning stories produced and broadcast onABC Radio. An online site was also developedfor the winning stories and features bothtranscripts and readings of the stories availableas audio-on-demand. In its third year, Short Stories 2004 attracted in excess of 2 000 entries. Quantity 5. Number of broadcast hours Each domestic radio network broadcasts for 24 hours each day for 365 days of theyear\u20148 784 hours in 2003-04 (including 29 February 2004). 6. Number of Radio stations The ABC has four national networks; ninemetropolitan Local Radio stations; 51 regionalstudios, including a new studio in Erina, NewSouth Wales that commenced transmission in November 2003, and one digital radiostation transmitted via the Internet anddigital television. 7. Level of radio content available through the Internet ABC NewsRadio, triple j , Radio National and Local Radio's 91.7 ABC Coast FM are streamed 24 hours each day. Plans to stream metropolitan Local Radio stations have been delayed by the need todevelop technical solutions to minimise theABC's exposure to legal risks associated with transmitting Local Radio services on theInternet. Live audio streams of these stationsmay need to be interrupted at times for legalreasons and where online rights preventmaterial such as cricket and Olympics Gamescoverage from being broadcast online. Rights issues impede the ability of ABC Classic FM to stream 24 hours. 8. Level of radio content available through audio-on-demand on the Internet. At June 2004: 91.8% of Radio National original programming, a decrease of 2.6% compared to June 2003. 42.25 hours of ABC Classic FM programming available per week, an increase of 1.25hours compared to June 2003. 27.5 hours of new triple j content is posted on the web each week compared to 6-10 hoursper quarter in 2002-03.

'I want to increase not just theuser numbers but the quality and fun that the kids get from chats and activities.' Joey Egger is responsible for ongoing production and maintenance of Australia's two largest children's online gateways\u2014 The Playground , designed for little kids, and Rollercoaster (for big kids up to 14 years). Joey admits to 'falling into' the new media job which combines creative and technicalskills. It was not an obvious step from her university studies of film theory, Japanese and Celtic studies. 'As well as offering fun and enjoyment there are learning angles.' For example, Rollercoaster works with ABC Science on some projects.'It's the kind of science that I would have likedas a kid,' says Joey, 'and that would havemade me understand some concepts of science that bored me at school.' Sites for popular teenage TV dramas such as Saddle Club can be a learning as well as an entertaining experience. For Silver Sun , 'instead of having all the action on the siteI've actually focused on the characters andissues that concern them.' Joey enjoys the challenges of the job.

The members of the Board are responsible for the preparation and true and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the Finance Minister's Orders. This includes responsibility for the maintenance of adequate accounting records and internal controls that are designed to prevent and detect fraud and error,and for the accounting policies and accounting estimates inherent in the financial statements. Audit approach I have conducted an independent audit of the financial statements in order to express an opinion on them toyou. My audit has been conducted in accordance with the Australian National Audit Office Auditing Standards,which incorporate Australian Auditing and Assurance Standards, in order to provide reasonable assurance asto whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The nature of an audit is influenced byfactors such as the use of professional judgement, selective testing, the inherent limitations of internal control,and the availability of persuasive, rather than conclusive, evidence. Therefore, an audit cannot guarantee that all material misstatements have been detected. While the effectiveness of management's internal controls over financial reporting was considered when determining the nature and extent of audit procedures, the audit was not designed to provide assurance on internal controls. The audit did not involve an analysis of the prudence of business decisions made by members of the Board or management. Procedures were performed to assess whether in all material respects the financial statements present fairly, in accordance with the Finance Minister's Orders made under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 , Accounting Standards and other mandatory financial reporting requirements in Australia, a view which is consistent with my understanding of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's and the consolidatedentity's performance as represented by the statements of financial performance, financial position and cash flows. The audit opinion is formed on the basis of these procedures, which included: examining, on a test basis, information to provide evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial report; and assessing the appropriateness of the accounting policies and disclosures used, and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Board. Independence In conducting the audit, I have followed the independence requirements of the ANAO, which incorporateAustralian professional ethical pronouncements. Audit Opinion In my opinion, the financial statements:(i) have been prepared in accordance with the Finance Minister's Orders made under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 and applicable Accounting Standards; and (ii) give a true and fair view, of the matters required by applicable Accounting Standards and other mandatory professional reporting requirements in Australia, and the Finance Minister's Orders, of the financial position of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the consolidated entity as at 30 June 2004, and their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The principal accounting policies adopted in preparing the financial statements of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (the 'Corporation' or 'ABC') and the consolidated financial statements of the Corporation, its controlled entities and the entities it controlled from time to time during the period, are stated to assist in a general understanding of these financial statements. These policies have been applied consistently by all entities in the economic entity. 1.1 Basis of Accounting The financial statements are required by clause 1(b) of Schedule 1 to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 and are a general purpose financial report. The statements have been prepared in accordance with: Finance Minister's Orders (being the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Orders (Financial Statements for reporting periods ending on or after 30 June 2004) ); Australian Accounting Standards and Accounting Interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board; and Consensus Views of the Urgent Issues Group. The Corporation and Consolidated Statements of Financial Performance and Financial Position have been prepared on an accrual basis and are in accordance with historical cost convention, except for certain assets,which, as noted, are at valuation. Except where stated, no allowance is made for the effect of changing priceson the results or the financial position. Assets and liabilities are recognised in the Corporation and Consolidated Statements of Financial Position when and only when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow and the amounts of the assets or liabilitiescan be reliably measured. Assets and liabilities arising under agreements equally proportionately unperformedare however not recognised unless required by an accounting standard. Liabilities and assets that areunrecognised are reported in the Schedule of Commitments and the Schedule of Contingencies (other thanunquantifiable or remote contingencies, which are reported at note 18). Revenues and expenses are recognised in the Corporation and Consolidated Statements of Financial Performance when and only when the flow or consumption or loss of economic benefits has occurred and can be reliably measured. 1.2 Rounding Amounts are rounded to the nearest $1 000 except in relation to: director remuneration officer remuneration auditor remuneration assets held in trust. 1.3 Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements are those of the economic entity, comprising the financial statements ofthe Australian Broadcasting Corporation and its controlled entities from the date control commences until thedate control ceases. Investment in controlled entities are carried in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's financial statements at the lower of cost or recoverable amount. Controlled entities have annual reporting periods ending 31 December. Accounts of the controlled entities are prepared for the period 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004 for consolidation using accounting policies which areconsistent with those of the Corporation. Control exists where the Australian Broadcasting Corporation has the capacity to dominate the decision making in relation to the financial and operating policies of another entity so the controlled entity operates to achievethe objectives of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The controlled entities of the Corporation include seven independent orchestral companies as detailed in note 24. The companies have been incorporated under the Corporations Act 2001 and are each governed by an independent Board of Directors. Each company is audited annually by the Auditor-General. The effects of all transactions and balances between the entities are eliminated in full. Details of controlled entities are contained in note 24.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2004125 ABC Annual Report Financial Statements 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 1.4 Taxation The Australian Broadcasting Corporation and its primary controlled entities are not subject to income tax pursuant to Section 71 of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983. Music Choice Australia Pty Ltd and The News Channel Pty Limited, whilst subject to income tax, have been inactive for the years ended 30 June 2000, 30 June 2001, 30 June 2002, 30 June 2003 and 30 June 2004. The Corporation and controlled entities are subject to fringe benefits tax and goods and services tax. Controlled entities are subject to payroll tax. Goods and Services Tax Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of goods and services tax (GST) exceptwhere the amount of GST incurred is not recoverable from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). In these circumstances, the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense. Receivables and payables are stated with the amount of GST included.The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the ATO, is included as a current asset in the Statement of Financial Position. Cashflows are included in the Statement of Cash Flows on a gross basis. The GST components arising from investing and financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to the ATO are classified as operatingcashflows. 1.5 Foreign Currency Transactions Revenues and expenditures denominated in foreign currencies are converted to Australian currency at theexchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction, or at the hedged rate. Exchange gains and losses and hedging costs arising on contracts entered into as hedges of specific revenue or expense transactions are deferred until the date of such transactions at which time they are included in thedetermination of such revenues or expenses. Open hedge contracts relating to all other revenue and expenditure transactions are converted at the applicable exchange rate at balance date with exchange gains or losses being included in the Statement of FinancialPerformance. All foreign currency balances are converted to Australian currency at the exchange rate prevailing at balance date, except for liabilities brought to account at contract rates, which are subject to currency swap contractsfor which an Australian Dollar currency repayment schedule has been adopted. Monetary assets and liabilitiesof overseas branches and amounts payable to or by the Corporation in foreign currencies are translated intoAustralian currency at the applicable exchange rate at balance date. 1.6 Derivatives Derivative financial instruments are used by the Corporation to manage financial risks and are not entered intofor trading purposes. The classes of derivative financial contracts used are interest rate swaps, forward foreignexchange contracts and foreign exchange. Derivative financial instruments designated as hedges are accounted for on the same basis as the underlying exposure. A. Interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements Interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements are entered into for the purpose of managing theCorporation's interest rate position. Gains or losses on interest rate swaps are included in the measurement of interest payments on the transactions to which they relate. Premiums or discounts are amortised throughthe Statement of Financial Performance each year over the life of the swap. B. Forward exchange contracts Forward exchange contracts are used to hedge specific and regular foreign exchange payments. Contractsare revalued at year end and the gain or loss is included in the Statement of Financial Performance. C. Foreign exchange options Foreign exchange options are used to hedge specific foreign currency payments. Premiums paid on foreignexchange options are amortised to the Statement of Financial Performance over the life of the contract.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 20041. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 1.7 Borrowings Borrowings are recorded at the amount of the net proceeds received until the liabilities are fully settled. Interest on the instruments is recognised as an expense on an effective yield basis. Borrowings are CommonwealthGovernment guaranteed. All borrowing costs are expensed as incurred except to the extent that they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised. The amount capitalised in a reporting period does not exceed thecosts incurred in that period. 1.8 Cash Cash means notes and coins held, and any deposits held at call with a bank or financial institution. 1.9 Receivables Receivables are carried at nominal amounts due less provision for doubtful debts. Trade debtors are normally settled within 30 days unless otherwise agreed and are carried at amounts due.The Corporation makes a specific provision for doubtful debts by conducting a detailed review of material debtors, making an assessment of the probability of recovery of those debts and taking into account past bad debts experience. 1.10 Bills of Exchange and Promissory Notes Premiums or discounts are amortised through the Statement of Financial Performance each year from the date of purchase so that investments attain their redemption value by maturity date and income is recognisedon an effective yield basis. Any profits or losses arising from the disposal prior to maturity are taken to the Statement of Financial Performance in the period in which they are realised. These assets are intended to be held to maturity and are carried at cost or cost adjusted for discounts and premiums. 1.11 Trade Creditors Creditors are recognised at their nominal amounts, being the amounts at which the liabilities will be settled.Liabilities are recognised to the extent that the goods and services have been received. Settlement is on normal commercial terms. 1.12 Reporting by Outcomes and Segments A comparison by outcomes specified in the Appropriation Acts relevant to the Corporation is presented in note 25. Any intra-government costs included in the figure 'net cost to Budget outcomes' are eliminated in calculatingthe actual budget outcome for the Government overall. The Corporation principally provides a national television and radio service within the broadcasting industry. It is therefore considered for segmental reporting to operate predominantly in one industry and in one geographicalarea, Australia. 1.13 Revenue Recognition The revenues described in this note are revenues relating to the core operating activities of the Corporation. Revenue from the sale of goods and services is recognised at fair value of the consideration received net of the amount of the goods and services tax upon the delivery of goods and services to customers. Interest revenue is recognised on a proportional basis taking into account the interest rates applicable to the financial assets. Credit sales are on normal commercial terms.Revenue from disposal of non-current assets is recognised when control of the asset has passed to the buyer.External contributions earned in respect of the production of television programs are reflected in the Statement of Financial Performance once the program has been broadcast (refer note 1.20). Subsidies, grants, sponsorships and donations are recognised on receipt unless paid to the Corporation for specific purpose where recognition of revenue will be recognised in accordance with the agreement. Recognition of appropriations from the Government is discussed in note 1.21. Core Operations All material revenues described in this note are revenues relating to the core operating activities of theCorporation and controlled entities. Details of revenue amounts are given in notes 5 and 6.126 ABC Annual Report Financial StatementsNotes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 20041. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 1.14 Employee Benefits Benefits Liabilities for services rendered by employees are recognised at the reporting date to the extent that they havenot been settled. Liabilities for wages and salaries (including non-monetary benefits) and annual leave, are measured at their nominal amounts. Other employee benefits expected to be settled within 12 months of their reporting date are measured at their nominal amounts. The nominal amount is calculated with regard to the rates expected to be paid on settlement of the liability. All other employee benefit liabilities are measured as the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date. Leave The liability for employee benefits includes provision for annual leave and long service leave. No provision hasbeen made for sick leave as all sick leave is non-vesting and the average sick leave taken in future years byemployees of the Corporation is estimated to be less than the annual entitlement for sick leave. The leave liabilities are calculated on the basis of employees' remuneration, including the Corporation's employer superannuation contribution rates to the extent that the leave is likely to be taken during servicerather than paid out on termination. The liability for long service leave has been determined by reference to the work of an actuary, Professional Financial Consulting Pty Ltd as at 30 June 2004 (Mercer Human Resource Consulting Pty Ltd as at 30 June2003). The estimate of the present value of the liability takes into account attrition rates and pay increasesthrough promotion and inflation. Separation and Redundancy A provision is recognised where there is a legal, equitable or constructive obligation as a result of a past eventand it is probable that a future sacrifice of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, the timingor amount of which is uncertain. Superannuation Employees of the Corporation are members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and the PublicSector Superannuation Scheme. The liability for their superannuation benefits is recognised in the financialstatements of the Commonwealth and is settled by the Commonwealth in due course. The Corporation makes employer contributions to the Commonwealth at rates determined by the actuary to be sufficient to meet the cost to the Commonwealth of the superannuation entitlements of the Corporation'semployees. The liability for superannuation recognised as at 30 June 2004 represents outstanding contributions for the final fortnight of the year. 1.15 Repairs and Maintenance Maintenance, repair expenses and minor renewals which do not constitute an upgrading or enhancement of equipment are expensed as incurred. 1.16 Acquisition of Assets Assets are recorded at cost on acquisition except as stated below. The cost of acquisition includes the fairvalue of assets transferred in exchange and liabilities undertaken. Assets acquired at no cost, or for nominal consideration, are initially recognised as assets and revenues at their fair value at the date of acquisition. 1.17 Property (Land and Buildings), Infrastructure, Plant and Equipment Asset Recognition ThresholdPurchases of property, infrastructure, plant and equipment are recognised initially at cost in the Statement ofFinancial Position. Purchases costing less than $2 000 are expensed in the year of acquisition except wherethey form part of a project or group of similar items which are significant in total. Revaluations BasisLand, buildings, infrastructure, plant and equipment are carried at valuation. Revaluations undertaken up to 30 June 2002 were done on a deprival basis; revaluations since that date are at fair value. This change inaccounting policy is required by Australian Accounting Standard AASB 1041 Revaluation of Non-Current Assets.127 ABC Annual Report Financial StatementsNotes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 20041. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 1.17 Property (Land and Buildings), Infrastructure, Plant and Equipment (continued) Fair and deprival values for each class of asset are determined as shown below. Asset Class Fair Value Measured at: Deprival Value Measured at: Land Market selling price Market selling priceBuilding Market selling price Market selling priceLeasehold improvements Depreciated replacement cost Depreciated replacement costInfrastructure, plant and equipment Depreciated replacement cost Depreciated replacement cost Under both deprival and fair value, assets that are surplus to requirement are measured at their net realisable value. In respect of the ABC's Gore Hill site an independent valuation continues to be adopted. Frequency Land, buildings, infrastructure, plant and equipment are revalued progressively in successive three-year cycles.All current cycles commenced on 1 July 2003. Freehold land, buildings on freehold land, leasehold land and buildings on leasehold land were all revalued in 2003-04. The majority of leasehold improvements were revalued in 2003-04. The balance (ABC shops and overseas bureaux) were revalued in 2002-03. The majority of infrastructure, plant and equipment assets were revalued in 2003-04. The balance (motor vehicles) were revalued in 2002-03. The Finance Minister's Orders require that all property, infrastructure, plant and equipment assets be measured at up-to-date fair values from 30 June 2005 onwards. The current year is therefore the last year in which theCorporation will undertake progressive revaluations. Conduct All valuations are conducted by an independent qualified valuer. Depreciation Depreciable property, infrastructure, plant and equipment assets are written-off to their estimated residual valuesover their estimated useful lives to the Corporation using, in all cases, the straight-line method of depreciation.Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the estimated useful life ofthe improvements or the unexpired period of the lease. Depreciation rates (useful lives) and methods are reviewed at each reporting date and necessary adjustments are recognised in the current, or current and future reporting periods, as appropriate. Depreciation rates applying to each class of depreciable asset are based on the following useful lives: 2004 2003 Buildings on freehold land 50 years 50 years Leasehold improvements Lease term Lease term Infrastructure, plant and equipment 5 to 15 years 5 to 15 years The aggregate amount of depreciation allocated for each class of asset during the reporting period is disclosed in note 7C. 1.18 Impairment of Non-Current Assets Non-current assets carried at up-to-date fair value at the reporting date are not subject to impairment testing. The non-current assets carried at cost or deprival value, which are not held to generate net cash inflows, have been assessed for indications of impairment. Where indications of impairment exist, the carrying amount of theasset is compared to its net selling price and depreciated replacement cost and is written down to its higher ofthe two amounts, if necessary. No write-down was required (2003 nil).128 ABC Annual Report Financial StatementsNotes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 20041. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 1.19 Intangibles The Corporation's intangibles comprise software for internal use. The assets are carried at cost. However, Schedule 1 now requires such assets, if carried on the cost basis, to be assessed for indications of impairment. The carrying amount of impaired assets must be written down to the higher of its net marketselling price or depreciated replacement cost. All software assets were assessed for impairment as at 30 June 2003 and 30 June 2004. None were found to be impaired. Software is amortised on a straight-line basis over its anticipated useful life.Useful lives: 2004 2003 Software 3-5 years 3-5 years 1.20 Inventories Inventories held for resale are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Inventories not held for resale are valued at cost, unless they are no longer required, in which case they are valued at net realisable value.Television programs are produced for domestic transmission and include direct salaries and expenses. Fixedproduction overheads are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Produced Programs The cost of produced television program inventory is amortised as follows: News, Current Affairs and Live Programs\u2014100% on first screening; Childrens, Education and Movies\u2014Straight-line over three years from completion; All other programs not covered above\u201490% first screening and 10% second screening or in third year; Programs not shown within three years of completion or purchase to be amortised 100% in year three. The costs of programs produced for News, Current Affairs and Radio are expensed as incurred. Such programs are normally broadcast soon after production, stock on hand at any time being minimal. Purchased Programs Purchased program inventory is amortised in accordance with the policy noted above or over the rights periodof the contract (whichever is lesser). Subsequent sales of residual rights are recognised in the period in which they occur.Merchandise Inventory The provision for obsolete retail stock is based on stock on hand over twelve months old and which mayrequire discounting or disposal. Items in engineering and general stores which have not been issued for threeyears are provided for as obsolete. 1.21 Transactions by the Commonwealth as Owner Appropriations From 1 July 1999, the Commonwealth Budget has been prepared under an accruals framework. Under this framework, Parliament appropriates monies to the Corporation as revenue appropriations, as loan appropriations, as equity injections and as Capital Use Charge. Revenue Appropriations Revenue from Government is revenue of the core operating activities of the Corporation. The full amount of appropriations for departmental outputs for the year is recognised as revenue.Equity Injections Amounts appropriated by the Parliament as equity injections are recognised as 'contributed equity' in accordance with the Finance Minister's Orders. Capital Use Charge A Capital Use Charge was imposed by the Government on the net assets of the Corporation. The Charge was accounted for as a dividend to Government. In accordance with the recommendations of a review of Budget Estimates and Framework, the Government decided that the Charge will not operate after 30 June 2003. Therefore, the amount of the Charge payable in respect of 2003 is the amount appropriated.129 ABC Annual Report Financial StatementsNotes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 20041. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 1.22 Leases A distinction is made between finance leases which effectively transfer from the lessor to the lessee substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of leased non-current assets and operating leases underwhich the lessor effectively retains substantially all such risks and benefits. Operating lease payments are expensed on a basis which is representative of the pattern of benefits derived from the leased assets. The net present value of future net outlays in respect of surplus space under non-cancellable lease agreements is expensed in the period in which the space becomes surplus. Lease incentives taking the form of 'free' leasehold improvements and rent holidays are recognised as liabilities. These liabilities are reduced by allocating lease payments between rental expense and reduction of the liability. 1.23 Grants The Corporation receives grant monies from time to time. Most grant agreements require the Corporation to perform services or provide facilities, or to meet eligibility criteria. A liability in respect of unearned revenues is recognised to the extent the services or facilities have notbeen provided or eligibility criteria have not been met. 1.24 Insurance The Corporation has insured for risk through the Government's insurable risk managed fund called 'Comcover'.Workers compensation is insured through Comcare Australia. 1.25 Loans Loans from government and bank loans are recognised at their principal amounts. Interest is expensed as itaccrues. Non-bank loans are carried at the balance not yet repaid. Interest is expensed as it accrues. 1.26 Changes in Accounting Policy The accounting policies used in the preparation of these financial statements are consistent with those used in 2002-03, except where stated. 1.27 Comparative Figures Where applicable, prior year comparative figures have been restated to reflect the current year's presentation in the financial statements. 130 ABC Annual Report Financial StatementsNotes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 20042. Adoption of Australian Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards from 2005-06 The Australian Accounting Standards Board has issued replacement Australian Accounting Standards to apply from 2005-06. The new standards are the Australian Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards(IFRSs), which are issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ('Australian Equivalents'). The newstandards cannot be adopted early. The standards being replaced are to be withdrawn with effect from 2005-06, but continue to apply for the 2003-04 financial year. It is expected that the Finance Minister will continue to require compliance with the Accounting Standards issued by the AASB, including the Australian Equivalents to IFRSs, in his Orders for the Preparation of theABC's financial statements for 2005-06 and beyond. The Australian Equivalents contain certain additional provisions which will apply to not-for-profit entities, including the ABC. Existing AASB standards that have no IFRS equivalent will continue to apply. Accounting Standard AASB 1047 Disclosing the Impact of Adopting Australian Equivalents to IFRSs requires that the financial statements for 2003-04 disclose: An explanation of how the transition to the Australian Equivalents is being managed; and A narrative explanation of the key differences in accounting policies arising from the transition. The purpose of this note is to make these disclosures. 2.1 Management of the transition to AASB Equivalents to IFRSs ABC management continue to assess the significance of these changes and is preparing for their implementation. An IFRS steering committee has been established to oversee and manage the transition to IFRS and to provideregular feedback to the ABC's Board on progress. A project plan is in place with the following key milestones: Identification of all major accounting policy differences between current AASB standards and the Australian Equivalents to IFRSs for disclosure in the 2003-04 Financial Statements; Identification of systems and process changes necessary to be able to report under the Australian Equivalents, including those necessary to enable capture of data under both sets of rules for 2004-05, and the testing and implementation of those changes; Preparation of a transitional Balance Sheet as at 1 July 2004, under Australian Equivalents; and Preparation of an Australian Equivalent Balance Sheet at the same time as the 30 June 2005 statements are prepared. To date, the major accounting and disclosure differences have been identified. The effect of these to the ABC is disclosed in section 2.2. 2.2 Major changes in accounting policy Changes to major accounting policies are discussed in the following paragraphs. Property, infrastructure, plant and equipment The current Finance Minister's Orders requires assets to be measured at up-to-date fair values as at 30 June2005 and allows entities to utilise the transitional arrangements where some classes of assets will remain atdeprival until that class is progressively revalued. In line with IFRS, it is expected that the Finance Minister's Orders will require property, infrastructure, plant and equipment assets carried at valuation in 2003-04 to be measured at up-to-date fair value from 2005-06. The Corporation has revalued property, infrastructure, plant and equipment at fair value effective 1 July 2003 as outlined in note 1.17. Borrowing costs related to qualifying assets are capitalized as outlined in note 1.7. It is expected that the Finance Minister's Orders (FMOs) for 2005-06 will elect to expense all borrowing costs in line with IFRS.Borrowing costs previously capitalised as at 1 July 2004 will be written-off to accumulated results. Under the current Accounting Standards non-current assets held for sale do not require separate disclosure. IFRS requires separate disclosure on the face of the Balance Sheet, previously named Statement of FinancialPosition. The Corporation will adopt this disclosure change. Current Accounting Standards require separate disclosure of the gross amount of disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset disposed on the faceplate of the Statement of Financial Performance. The Statement of Financial Performance is to renamed Income Statement. AASB 116 - Property, Plant & Equipment requires the net gain/loss of disposal to be shown on the Income Statement faceplate and will be adopted.131 ABC Annual Report Financial StatementsNotes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 20042. Adoption of Australian Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards from 2005-06 (continued) 2.2 Major changes in accounting policy (continued) Intangible Assets The Corporation currently recognises software assets on the cost basis as outlined in note 1.19. This treatmentwill continue under IFRS. The Corporation does not hold any other intangible assets and therefore will not be impacted by the change to IFRS in this regard. Impairment of Assets The Corporation's policy on impairment of assets is stated at note 1.18. The most significant change as a result of IFRS to the ABC is the requirement to assess at each balance date if there is any indication that an non-current asset may be impaired. If there is an indication of impairment,measurement of recoverable amount must be conducted. Impairment losses are accounted for as expensesfor assets measured at cost or revaluation decrements for assets measured at fair value. Inventory The Corporation's policy on inventory is stated at note 1.20. IFRS requires inventory held for distribution for no consideration or at a nominal amount to be carried at the lower of cost or current replacement cost. This is consistent with the Corporation's policy. Employee Benefits The Corporation's policy on employee benefits is outlined in note 1.14. The provision for long service leave is measured at the present value of estimated future cash outflows using market yields as at the reporting date on national government bonds. Under IFRS, the same discount rate will be used unless there is a deep market in high quality corporate bonds, in which case the market yield on such bonds will be used. The Finance Minister's Orders, by reference to Finance Briefs, do not allow for a present value calculation of estimated future cash outflows of annual leave expected to be taken beyond twelve months. AASB 119Employee Benefits requires annual leave to be a measurement of the present value of estimated future cash outflows where leave is expected to be taken beyond one year. Unless the Finance Minister's Orders specifically preclude this measurement, the Corporation will be required to apply this measurement treatment. Financial Instruments Financial assets and liabilities are likely to be accounted for as 'held at fair value through profit and loss' oravailable-for-sale where the fair value can be reliably measured (in which case, changes in value are initiallytaken to equity). Fair values will be published prices where an active market exists or by appraisal. Cash and receivables are expected to continue to be measured at cost.Financial assets, except those classified as 'held at fair value through profit and loss', will be subject to impairment testing. Cash Flow Statements The Corporation's policy on cash is outlined at note 1.8. Under AASB 107 Cash Flow Statements the definition of cash equivalent is broader and will include short-term money market investments that are convertible to cash. The Corporation may be required to reclassify some investments currently disclosed under receivables as cash.132 ABC Annual Report Financial StatementsNotes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 20043.

Economic Dependency The ABC was established in 1932 as the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Since 1983 it has operated under the provisions of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983. The Corporation and its controlled entities are dependent upon direct and indirect appropriations of monies by Parliament. In excess of 80% of normal activities are funded in this manner, and without these appropriationsthe Corporation and its controlled entities would be unable to meet their obligations.

Financial Instruments (continued) B. Net Fair Values of Financial Assets and Liabilities The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the net fair values: Cash, receivables, payables and short term borrowings The carrying amount approximates the net fair value because of the short term maturity. Investments The carrying amount for non traded investments has been assessed by the directors based on the underlyingnet assets, expected cash flows and any particular special circumstances of the investee as approximating net fair values. Long term borrowings The net fair values of long term borrowings are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis, based on current interest rates for liabilities with similar risk profiles. Interest rate swaps and cross currency swap agreements The net fair values of unrecognised financial instruments reflect the estimated amounts the economic entityexpects to pay or receive to terminate the contracts (net of transaction costs) or to replace the contracts attheir current market rates as at reporting date. This is based on independent market quotations and usingstandard valuation techniques. Forward exchange contracts The net fair values of forward exchange contracts is taken to be the unrealised gain or loss at balance date calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.

Credit Risk Exposures Credit risk represents the loss that would be recognised if counterparties to financial instruments fail to performas contracted. The economic entity has no significant exposures to any concentrations of credit risk.Financial Assets The economic entity's maximum exposure to credit risk at reporting date in relation to each class of recognisedfinancial assets is the carrying amount, net of provision for doubtful debts, of those assets as indicated in theStatement of Financial Position. Items not recognised in the Statement of Financial Position The credit risk arising from dealings in financial instruments is controlled by a strict policy of credit approvals,limits and monitoring procedures. The economic entity has no material concentration of credit risk with any single counterparty and, as a matter of policy, only transacts with financial institutions that have a high creditrating. Credit exposure of foreign currency and interest rate derivatives is represented by the net fair value ofthe contracts, as disclosed. D. Hedging Instruments Specific HedgesThe net unrecognised gain of $105 384 (2003 unrecognised loss $94 555) on specific hedges of anticipated foreign currency purchases will be recognised at the date of the underlying transactions. General Hedges At balance date, the Corporation held forward exchange contracts to buy United States Dollars (USD), Pounds Sterling (GBP) and the Euro (EUR). Gains/losses arising from general hedges outstanding at year end have been recognised in the Statement of Financial Performance.146 ABC Annual Report Financial StatementsNotes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 200417.

Indemnities and Insurance Premiums for Officers The ABC acquired professional indemnity insurance and other appropriate insurances under Comcoverincluding a Director's and Officer's Liability on termsand conditions which are consistent with provisions of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 . Judicial Decisions and Reviews by Outside Bodies The Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) conducted two reviews involving the ABC. The ANAO Corporate Governance in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Follow-Up Audit (Audit Report No. 38, 2003-04, tabled 31 March 2004)reviewed aspects of the ANAO's 2002 review ofCorporate Governance in the ABC. The reportacknowledged that the ABC had madeconsiderable progress toward full implementation of the original ANAO recommendations. A furtherrecommendation to enhance the operation ofprogram quality reviews was made and agreedby the ABC. A review of the financial aspects of the ABC's conversion to digital broadcasting was commencedand has yet to be tabled. This review is an extensionof earlier ANAO reviews of the ABC's digitalconversion process. The Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (DCITA) undertook aperformance review of the ABC's National InterestInitiatives (NII) program. The outcome of the reviewwas not made available to the Corporation. However,funding for the NII was extended until 2007-08 in the 2004-05 Federal Budget. Matters referred to the Australian Broadcasting Authority for review are noted in the ABC Audiencessection (page 29).Appendix 10 - Other Required ReportsExpenditure on market research and advertising for the year was $4 941 869, a decrease of $3 923 405on the previous year. The Corporation utilises advertising agencies and market research organisations predominately topromote ABC Enterprises and Televisionprogramming, including ABC Asia Pacific broadcasting. 2003-04 2002-03 $$ Advertising 1 660 683 5 296 680Market Research 3 281 186 3 568 594Total 4 941 869 8 865 274Appendix 11 - Advertising and Market Research Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S) is the legaland moral responsibility of all; from the Board andExecutive Directors through to every ABC employee,as well as contractors and visitors to ABC sites andactivities wherever these may be located. It requiresthe ABC to manage its workplace risks in asystematic way. To operate effectively, OH&S requires accurate data and information to guide choices in establishing safesites and systems of work to manage risks. It alsorequires supervision and adequate training. It is driven by pro-active management activity, ongoingaccountability and the voluntary work of Health andSafety Representatives (HSRs), as well as state-based OH&S Committees. HSRs and OH&SCommittees have statutory roles under theOccupational Health and Safety (CommonwealthEmployment) Act 1991 ('the Act'). Additionally, it is recognised that OH&S performance has an impact on the overall success of the ABC,including operational funds available for programmaking. The annual workers' compensation premiumpayable by the ABC to the Commonwealth's insurer,Comcare, rose from $1 215 175 for 2002-03 to $1 980 000 for 2003-04, an increase of 63% over theperiod; it is expected to increase a further 34% for2004-05. These increases reflect both general rises inthe cost of claims across Commonwealth agenciesand the increased incidence of claims, particularlypsychological injuries. The ABC mitigated the 2003-04 premium increase through a $204 000 rebate reflecting effective casemanagement, including supervisor and staffparticipation in return-to-work programs, that reducedthe expected costs of claims. Human Resources isworking with other ABC Divisions to establish a moresystematic approach to safety within the ABC that willlessen injuries and to stabilise, if not reduce, premiums. In early 2004, the Managing Director met the CEO of Comcare to discuss the ABC's commitment tonational OH&S targets for the reduction of incidentsand injuries and of time off work, and the eliminationof workplace deaths. The ABC is working towardsmaking a formal commitment to these targets. Comcare Investigations and Audit The ABC is working cooperatively with Comcare inreviewing systems of OH&S management. Recentaudits of plant and equipment management system inall states (except the Northern Territory and the ACT)have indicated a generally good level of complianceacross these areas of ABC activity. As a result of theaudits, Comcare made two recommendations to improve the ABC's overall compliance with plantregulations and to strengthen its plant managementsystem: that the ABC introduce both a plant andequipment policy and procedures document, and aplant compliance review and reporting process. TheABC is taking steps to implement theserecommendations. Developments Human Resources has continued to raise the profileof OH&S in the ABC through communication andtraining and has been successful in securing activecommitments from Divisions\u2014notably ProductionResources, Technology and Distribution and BusinessServices\u2014to address high-risk areas. Development of effective strategies to reduce Occupational Overuse Syndrome (OOS) have resultedin a 43.5% reduction in news claims, from 23 claimsin the previous year to 13 claims in 2003-04. A new OH&S Intranet Site launched to better inform staff and assist the divisions meet their duty of care. The ABC purchased an Incident Central Reporting System, which is expected to be operational by theend of August 2004. This database and managementsystem will assist in (i) better identifying and managingrisks, meeting targets and addressing high-risk areasof activity, and (ii) scheduling and monitoringresponses to ABC-wide safety activities. An ABC electrical safety program commenced with relevant Divisions required to 'test and tag' all plug-inelectrical equipment deemed to be at risk under therelevant Australian standards. An ABC-wide 'SafetyInspection, Testing and Tagging of Electrical EquipmentPolicy and Procedures' was also developed. Human Resources continues to work with ABC Procurement and other Divisions to identify andeliminate or minimise hazards at the pre-procurementstage. Assessable OH&S accountabilities are being added to the job plans of all supervisors, managers andother ABC staff. Three new training courses were developed and piloted for national implementation: OH&SAwareness, OH&S Risk Management and an onlineManual Handling course. Courses in Office Safety,with links to preventing OOS, and PreventingPsychological Injury are being piloted as a priority.Appendix 12 - Occupational Health and Safety163 ABC Annual Report AppendicesAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2004The threat of terrorism at the Athens Olympics in August 2004 has required a comprehensive riskmanagement approach to the deployment andoperations of ABC employees and talent overseas. A 'hostile environment' training course used for the ABC's overseas correspondents and crews hasbeen modified and all ABC staff travelling to Athenswill be trained. Trained Health and Safety Representatives are now present for all ABC sites, and each state has anactive health and safety committee. New policies and guidelines that support OH&S were launched, including a Guide for Employees About Work/Life Balance , an Anti-Bullying Policy, a Drug and Alcohol Policy with guidelines for managers, A RadioFrequency Radiation (RF) Safety Policy and a RoofAccess Policy. Policies and guides presently beingreviewed that support OH&S include the ABC Codeof Conduct and the ABC Rehabilitation Policy. The ABC, in conjunction with film and television industry participants, developed an OH&Scompetency matrix for various high-risk film andtelevision production roles. Together with industryrepresentatives, the ABC continued to developimproved and practical safety guidelines for the filmand television industry. Human Resources is monitoring the incidence and costs of psychological injury and identifying ways ofminimising such injury within existing ABC systems. Increasingly there are operational links between security and safety in the ABC, especially in regionalcentres where staff may be particularly vulnerable. Human Resources is also investigating: noise, headset use and hearing conservation to minimisehearing loss in Radio and Television; staff ageing and its possible impact on OH&S outcomes; andminimising manual handling issues and injuriesamong field operations staff. Statistics 2003-04 During the year, 143 OH&S-related incidents werereported internally. Twenty dangerous occurrencesand 11 serious personal injuries were notified toComcare under Section 68 of the Act, including anumber of electric shocks. In 2003-04, 102 claims for workers' compensation were accepted. The total costs-to-date of all compensable injuries occurringthis year is approximately $405 000, with a totalestimated cost of $1 600 000. Approximately 151 individual ergonomic workstation assessments were conducted nationally as an OOSprevention measure. Accidents, Dangerous Occurrencesand Investigations In February 2004 Comcare investigated the new scenic workshop at Lancely Place, issuing twoProhibition and three Improvement Notices under theAct in relation to the scenic workshop's plant, equipmentand operations. The ABC addressed these issuesand Comcare lifted one of the plant-relatedProhibition Notices on 30 March 2004. However,Comcare requires clear evidence of a change in arange of operational behaviour before lifting theremaining notice. The Improvement Notices requiredthe ABC to carry out risk assessments andimplement a number of controls in the workshop.These matters were addressed and all three of thesenotices were lifted on 30 March 2004. Rehabilitation Compensation and Rehabilitation Managementcontinues to: expedite access of employees tonecessary services and support; promote appropriatemanagement of claims; promote early and durablereturn-to-work outcomes through the implementationof rehabilitation programs; collect and analyseincident data to identify trends within the workplace;and control claim costs through the implementation of return-to-work programs to reduce 'lost time'. Human Resources appointed an additional case manager for workers' compensation claims and was able to improve return-to-work rates and earn a $392 000 rebate on workers' compensationpremiums. Employee Assistance Program The Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is acounselling and advice service for ABC employeesand their families. In 2003-04, the EAP continued to provide wide support to ABC staff and families,attracting 313 new clients. The services is used by6.1% of employees.164 ABC Annual Report AppendicesAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2004 Appendix 12 - Occupational Health and Safety (continued) Compliance with PerformanceReporting Framework The ABC is required to report on its performance in meeting the Commonwealth Disability Strategy underthe designated core government roles of Employerand Provider. Employer Employment policies, procedures and practicescomply with the requirements of the DisabilityDiscrimination Act 1992.The ABC Disability Action Plan includes strategies forrecruitment, selection, training, development andsupport. It forms part of the Equity and Diversity Management Plan (EDMP) covering the period 2003-06. Strategies included in the EDMP are linked to theCorporation's Divisional plans and retain the target of5% representation of staff with disabilities of the totalworkforce. During the year, the Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) data collection form was updated to include abroad definition of disability and the provision ofnational disability data. All non-casual staff were senta letter from the Director of Human Resourcesoutlining the background to the request for data. Appendix 13 - Commonwealth Disability StrategyThis initiative resulted in a substantial increase in the number of staff providing EEO data to 10.8 per cent,or double the Corporation's target, at 30 June 2004. The ABC's Equity and Diversity Policy includes references to people with disabilities and the ABC hasa general policy for access and equity for people withdisabilities. Recruitment and selection guidelinesadvise on selection processes, merit selection, andavoidance of stereotyping, assumptions anddiscrimination. The ABC's draft revision of its Code of Conduct embraces the principle of 'respecting each other', in relation to disability discrimination. Relevant plans, policies and guidelines are available to staff on the ABC's Intranet site. The ABC continued to improve access for both employees and visitors with disabilities. This has beenachieved by improvements in the redevelopment ofthe Canberra premises as well as the new PortMacquarie building, both of which now have facilitiesfor employees and visitors with disabilities includingcar parking, general access and toilets. During the year the ABC participated in discussions with the Disability Studies and Research Institute toconsider a new research project aimed at developingand implementing strategies to improve the inclusionof people with disabilities in Australian media practice,including as audience, producers, participants andsubjects. The ABC is a member organisation of Employers Making A Difference, the Australian employers'network for increasing disability employmentopportunities and awareness. Recruitment information for potential job applicants is available in accessible formats on request. Accessible formats are available for potential job applicants and have been provided on request during the year by mail, fax, email and online. The turnaround for responding to accessible format requests is usually the same as for otherrequests. Advertisements have also been included on the Internet. The ABC's central recruitment group has not received any requests for alternate formats for applicants withdisabilities other than the range of formats available. Agency recruiters and managers apply the principle of 'reasonable adjustment'. Information on the principles of reasonable adjustment has been provided to managers andthose responsible for recruitment. Both training andinformation have been provided to ABC State HumanResources Managers and health and safetyrepresentatives regarding reasonable adjustment. The revised EEO data collection form now includes aquestion about individual staff needs and adjustmentsin the workplace for staff with disabilities. Those who requested assistance in the August 2003 survey were assisted individually with their needs. A number of staff were accommodated with equipment, special leave and flexible workarrangements during the year. Training and development programs consider the needs of staff with disabilities. The ABC's Disability Action Plan includes strategies on training, development and support. Through itsperformance management system, the ABC ensuresthat all staff, including people with disabilities, havetheir training needs identified and addressed. TheABC is a Registered Training Organisation and meetsstandards of training and accommodation that areinclusive of people with disabilities. Building Serviceshas been consulted about the need for accessibletraining rooms and facilities. Training and development programs include information on disability issues as they relate to the content of the program. In May 2004, the ABC introduced training courses on discrimination, harassment and bullying, includingreferences to disability issues. Initial training hasoccurred in Melbourne, Hobart, Canberra, Brisbaneand regional New South Wales. This training iscompulsory for all relevant staff. Staff induction information includes the ABC's diversity, discrimination, harassment and bullyingpolicies.

In August 2003, the ABC returned its annual National Environment Protection Measures (NEPM)Questionnaire to the Environmental Protection andHeritage Council, retaining its low risk agency status. The ABC provided its Annual Energy Consumption values to the Department of Industry, Tourism andResources online Energy Data Gathering andReporting (EDGAR) database in October 2003. Whilethe Corporation's building occupancy temporarilyincreased by 12% its energy consumption decreased by almost 7%. However, the ABC reported an overallincrease in energy consumption of 6% due to theinclusion of aviation fuel, which had not beenpreviously reported. On 11 February 2004, the ABC advised the Department of the Environment and Heritage (DEH) of the status of the Corporation's EnvironmentalManagement System (EMS). The advice confirmedthat ABC had adapted the DEH Model EMS for theUltimo Centre and intended to introduce the EMS to two other sites by the end of 2004.Appendices for the year ended 30 June 2004 In 2003-04, the ABC Advisory Council met threetimes. It made 36 recommendations and 46commendations. Members Deborah Klika (Convenor)Jeff Heath (until 31 December 2003)Carole Miller OAM (until 31 December 2003)Anita Turner (until 31 December 2003)Sir John Yocklunn (until 31 December 2003)Simon Andrews Professor Michael Burgess Glyn Parry Beverly Smallwood Keith Smith Sascha Walkley Phil Wood Dr Pamela Chick (from 1 January 2004)Dr Paul Collier (from 1 January 2004)Robyn Lambley (from 1 January 2004)Alan Wu (from 1 January 2004) Summary of Recommendations, Responses and Commendations 2003-04 R1/2/03 Message Stick Move to a prime time program slot to better reach its target audience and allow wider exposure. Director of Television: No response provided. R2/2/03 Landline Should be more prominently positioned in theschedule, or else be repeated at a better time for its target audience and to attract a wider audience. Director of Television: No response provided. R3/2/03 Curriculum Studies A broader range of programs relating to the HighSchool curriculum would be desirable. The ABCshould provide general coverage of the authors orsubjects of curriculum texts, in the vein of recentprograms on Dickens, Jane Austen and Mark Twain. Director of Radio: Radio National often takes this approach. These issues are also discussed on an adhoc basis on Local Radio and are generally coveredwhen topical, normally at the start of a school year. Radio is possibly not the best medium for coveringcurriculum texts, as the target audience tends tofavour visual or interactive media, such as televisionand online. Director of Television: No response provided. Director of Development: The programs on Dickens, Jane Austen and Mark Twain depended on expensivedramatic re-enactment. Programs with a lowproduction budget that relate to the High Schoolcurriculum are most likely to be suitable for daytimebroadcast, which is not currently a priority. R4/2/03 Great Roads of Australia The ABC should develop a series of programs on thegreat roads of Australia\u2014e.g. the Great Ocean Roadand the Birdsville Track\u2014of relevance to people whotravel in Australia. Director of Radio: ABC Radio's Regional Production Fund (RPF) has commissioned a series of 36 eight-minute programs called Highway One , which are being aired on Local Radio and are also available onABC Online. The RPF has also commissioned a 12-part series on roadhouses along the Track in theNorthern Territory. Director of Television: No response provided. Director of Development: During the past two years, ABC Development has received one proposal, whichwas not supported. Concept explored on ABC Radiovia a number of programs, including The Idlers , currently funded by ABC Development. The likely cost of travel and field work would probably be anobstacle to in-house development and production of a television program. R5/2/03 Built Environment Recommends a program on architecture, whichreflects the built environment in the context ofeveryday life and work. Director of Radio: Radio National's The Comfort Zone is the examination of the built environment,Appendix 17 - ABC Advisory CouncilAppendix 16 - Ecologically Sustainable Development and Environmental Performance168 ABC Annual Report AppendicesAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2004 Appendix 17 - ABC Advisory Council (continued) particularly in Australia. Local Radio in Canberra carries an architecture segment. ABC Radio hascommissioned a major series with an online componenton the development of Australian architecture calledShed, Shack and Shingle , for Radio National's Big Ideas program. Director of Television: No response provided. Director of Development: Two programs currently in development. Shed, Shack and Shingle is a series on Australian architecture for ABC Radio to becompleted in December 2003. Shelter from the Storm is a proposed television series on the history of human shelter; ABC Television will determine whetherit proceeds once the development work is complete. R6/2/03 Day in the Life of... Suggests a program reflecting jobs and careers ofeveryday people\u2014expanding on what Andrew Dentondoes in Enough Rope . Director of Development: Similar concepts have been explored in the past, such as the West Australian andTasmanian versions of Snapshot . Profiling jobs and careers is not a current priority for ABC Television. Director of Television: No response provided. Director of Radio: ABC Radio draws Council's attention to the wide range of broadcasts by LocalRadio stations which follow this theme. R7/2/03 Rage Saturday morning Rage is indistinguishable from a commercial channel; it promotes video clips suggestingyoung women need to look glamorous in bikinis to bemusicians.

Director of Television: No response provided. R13/2/03 Length of Feedback and Media Watch Feedback too short and could cover a greater range of issues; often treats genuine concerns in a flippantmanner. Council interested in receiving the results of ABC Television's monitoring of the program.Both Media Watch and Feedback should be of sufficient length to cover their topics. Director of Television: No response provided.169 ABC Annual Report AppendicesAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2004 Appendix 17 - ABC Advisory Council (continued) R14/2/03 Corporate Watch Requests follow-up on previous suggestion of a 'corporate watch' program along the lines of Media Watch . Director of Television: No response provided. Director of Development: Business Breakfast (to be combined with World at Noon ) would be the appropriate vehicle for this subject matter. No indication of a strong interest in more business-related programming. Not a development priority for ABC Television. R1/3/03 A Big Country Revisited Commends A Big Country Revisited \u2014a superb program building on what the ABC does best. A further series would be most welcome. Director of Television: Noted. ABC Television will consider the option of a further series. R2/3/03 Trauma\u2014Life and Death in the ER Welcomes the screening of this program in an earliertimeslot. Budget permitting, an Australian version ofsuch a program would be desirable. Director of Development: Children's Ward , a series set in Western Australia's Princess Margaret Hospital forChildren, is scheduled in 2004 in the Reality Bites slot. The recent ABC series A Case for the Coroner , while not exploring the emergency room, offered a behind-the-scenes look at the investigations of the NSWState Coroner.

Director of Television: Noted. It has not been possible to include a repeat of the National Press Club in the current evening schedule. However, ABC Televisionwill consider the relevance of the program for anevening audience. It does not select the guests orproduce the broadcast, so cannot address programpublicity. R4/3/03 Online News Archive Requests further attention be given to providing a link to the news features archive both on the front pageand news page. Director of New Media and Digital Services: For both technical and legal reasons, ABC News Onlineprovides archives for only a limited number ofsections. No general News archive is available to thepublic. If ABC Online provides a comprehensivearchive in the future, the most appropriate means of linking to it will be investigated. R5/3/03 Landline Weather Forecast Request for a seven-day weather forecast in Landline .Director of News and Current Affairs : Landline is recorded on Friday afternoons for broadcast onSundays. A seven-day weather forecast would thusrequire reliable forecast data nine days ahead. The Weather Company, which assists the ABC inpreparing its television weather forecasts, is notconfident of reliably projecting nine days ahead. The Weather Company has been asked to keep this proposal in mind for the future. R6/3/03 Wine and Food Program Reiterates previous recommendation that the ABCdevelop a wine and food program examining theregions of Australia. Director of Television: Noted. Surfing The Menu is a combined food and travel series that covers anumber of Australian regions. ABC Television willcontinue to seek broadcast opportunities that presentfood and cooking in an interesting, informative andentertaining manner. Director of Development: The development of a new Australian cooking series is not a current priority for2004. However, the ABC is currently broadcastingSurfing the Menu , which reflects Council's recommendation. ABC Local Radio features regional chefs with regular cooking segments andaccompanying websites with information available in delicious magazine. R7/3/03 Australian Writers The ABC should look to developing a television seriesfocussing on Australian writers. Director of Development: In 2004, the main television initiative showcasing literature is The Big Read , which focuses on popularising books and creating a publicengagement with reading. Australian writers willfeature prominently in the process. Director of Television: Noted. ABC Television draws the Council's attention to Critical Mass and Words with James Griffin . Over recent months, the Critical Mass program has included debate and discussion on various aspects of Australian writing and allowedAustralian poets and writers to contribute to publicdebate. R8/3/03 Program on Environmental Sustainability The ABC should investigate a series on environmentalsustainability, including issues such as watermanagement, weather and building laws. Theprogram could link into other ABC productions, e.g. Landline , Gardening Australia and Earthbeat . Director of Development: See description of The Water Dreamers in response to recommendation R9/2/03. No other sustainability-related projectscurrently on the development slate. A number of regular ABC programs cover the issue ofenvironmental sustainability and ABC Online alsoprovides information on the environment. Director of Television: Noted. ABC Television will consider opportunities for such a series. The Divisiondraws the Council's attention to the return of ongoingseries such as Landline and Gardening Australia , 170 ABC Annual Report AppendicesAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2004 Appendix 17 - ABC Advisory Council (continued) and the ABC natural history co-production, Wild Australasia , which will be broadcast on ABC Television in 2004. R9/3/03 Great Institutions Recommends that the ABC look to producing aprogram on significant institutions, such as museums,galleries and libraries. Director of Development: No series on great institutions is in development. However, a program is in development that examines the history andimportance of the National Gallery of Victoria. ABC Development has also done preliminary work on a number of similar projects. Director of Television: Noted. ABC Television notes that considerable work has been undertaken inseeking to produce various programs involving some of Australia's key institutions. The Division will continue to investigate program opportunities of this kind. R10/3/03 Contemporary Music Program Recommends that the ABC develop a family-orientated contemporary music program appealing to a broad range of audiences in the groundbreakingtradition of 6 O'Clock Rock and Countdown . Director of Development: The market for programs of this style has changed dramatically due to theemergence of new media forms. Music andaccompanying material are available from a range of sources, including the ABC's Internet radio stationdigand other online music sites. Director of Television: Noted. ABC Television will consider opportunities for such a series. R11/3/03 Programs on Adolescence Recommends a program on young people andadolescence which builds on segments in George Negus Tonight and Local Radio. Director of Development: No series on this topic are currently in development. However, the ABC does present programming relating to it through shortseries. Plumpton High Babies explored the issue of teenage pregnancy. In 2004, Our Boys will follow the lives of students and teachers from Canterbury BoysHigh in Sydney's inner west. Director of Television: Noted. ABC Television will consider opportunities for such a series. R12/3/03 Forgotten Heroes Given the emphasis on winning and success,recommends a program on 'forgotten heroes'. Director of Development: ABC Development's preferred approach to this subject area is thematic.During 2003, the ABC broadcast Love Letters From A War , which gave a very personal insight into the impact of separation during World War II. A secondproject is in development. Projects in developmentinclude the proposed documentary series Next Big Things , which would focus on people on the cusp of greatness across the arts, academia and sport,and a documentary about the Aboriginal tracker who assisted in the Peter Falconio case in theNorthern Territory. Director of Television: Noted. ABC Television will consider opportunities for such a series. R13/3/03 Contemporary Composers Television The Sunday arts program should contain segmentson Australian Contemporary Composers. Director of Television: Noted. ABC Television will consider opportunities for such a series. Director of Development: As this is an existing commissioned strand, this is a matter for ABCTelevision. R14/3/03 Different Places Suggests development of a series looking atAustralian families living in different circumstances and places. Director of Development: ABC Development is currently supporting a documentary initiative basedaround the theme of 'family'. This includes the 30-minute programs Taylor Made , About Ally , The Longest Season and Outskirts . This initiative follows on from Family Foibles . ABC Development is also supporting work on a third series of Dynasties . Director of Television: Noted. ABC Television will consider opportunities for such a series. R1/1/04 Australian Writers Notes response to recommendation R7/3/03. Thereis still an opportunity to present the 'word as writtenfrom the page'. Recommends that ABC Enterprisesdevelop a DVD consisting of five-minute readingsfrom Australian novels and poems with complementarymusic/imagery. Director of Development: See response to recommendation R7/3/03. Director of Enterprises: Such a DVD would have difficulty satisfying the criteria for release as an ABCEnterprises product under the Divisional ProductCharter. It is likely to prove to be both uneconomicalto the ABC and prohibitively costly to the consumer.ABC Audio has acquired the audio rights to majorliterary works, including Tim Winton's Cloudstreet and Peter Carey's My Life as a Fake , and has released these works on audio cassette and CD. ABC Audio has recently begun releasing audio product in MP3format and will continue to explore opportunities tocombine images with sound, as recommended. Director of New Media and Digital Services: Nothing further to add to response from ABC Enterprises. R2/1/04 ABC Information 'Window' Suggests that New Media and Digital Services shouldexplore the provision of regularly-updated informationabout the ABC for users connected to the Internetthrough a small 'window'.171 ABC Annual Report AppendicesAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2004 Appendix 17 - ABC Advisory Council (continued) Director of New Media and Digital Services: A downloadable application of this kind has beenexplored. Technical and workflow issues haveprevented implementation. It may be pursued in the future. R3/1/04 (Revised) Promotions Repetition Promotions repetitive, particularly during televisionprime time. The percentage policy for self- and cross-promotion on ABC Radio and Television should relateto the time frames used to promote general programand product information. Director of Radio: ABC Radio uses promotions to provide station identification, preview individualinterviews or forthcoming programs and cross-promote other ABC activities, programs and services.As required in the current Corporate Plan , ABC Radio provides 20% of its on-air promotional time to thecross-promotion of other ABC services. It seeks toproduce and place promotions in a style consistentwith the nature of surrounding programming. Director of Television: ABC Television complies with the 20% cross-promotion requirement in the currentABC Corporate Plan . The recommendation could be considered for the next Corporate Plan , currently in preparation. R4/1/04 Beyond the Bitumen Local Radio should take up the Beyond the Bitumen program (a regular segment on the 720 ABC PerthBreakfast show) to provide a window on people outside metropolitan areas. Director of Radio: Networked Local Radio broadcasts a similar feature each weekday morning during Early Mornings on both regional and metropolitan stations. It includes segments from the best of The Rural Report and stories from Radio National's Bush Telegraph . R5/1/04 Lateline Lateline seems to move around the late-eveningschedule. Director of Television: Noted. ABC Television endeavours to meet the advertised time of 10.30pmon Monday through Thursday evenings.R6/1/04 The Comfort Zone Recommends a television program along the lines of The Comfort Zone . Director of Television: Noted. ABC Television congratulates ABC Radio on the production of The Comfort Zone , which addresses the cultural significance of architecture, design, landscape,gardens and food. ABC Television has a number ofprograms covering similar subject matter. The Divisionbelieves that this is the correct approach for ABCTelevision. Further, budgetary restrictions do not allowfor new television programs that duplicate subjectmatter covered in existing programs. In relation toarchitecture, Sunday Afternoon will feature a five- week season on architecture in 2004 and a specialprogram on Indigenous architecture and designduring NAIDOC Week in July. ABC Television is alsodeveloping Northcott Narratives , a documentary featuring residents of a Sydney public housing tower block working on a play about their lives and their building. R7/1/04 Your Favourite Place Recommends ABC Radio examine the possibility ofproducing 30 second sound bites of people speakingfrom their favourite place. Director of Radio: ABC Local Radio currently broadcasts segments similar to this, including theQueensland Local Radio segment You Wouldn't Live Anywhere Else . The weekly networked Local Radio program Australia All Over with Ian McNamara carries a Why I Live Where I Live feature and Australia All Over has introduced a new segment reflecting the increasingly mobile nature of Australia's population. R8/1/04 Country Hour\u2014Local Radio Country Hour should be broadcast on local stations such as ABC Central Coast and on metropolitan radio. Director of Radio: The content of The Country Hour is specifically crafted to be relevant to a regionalaudience. It is generally not suitable for a station suchas ABC Central Coast where the 'window' for localprogramming is very limited. Some smaller metropolitanLocal Radio stations\u2014specifically Darwin and Hobart\u2014take The Country Hour . However, the program is not particularly relevant to larger metropolitan markets. Commendations The ABC Advisory Council commended the following ABC Radio and Television programs, and ABC Onlinecontent: the new series of Australian Story ; A Wedding in Ramallah ; After the Fires ; Background B riefing ; Beyond the Bitumen ; Coodabeen Champions ;The Comfort Zone ; The Deep End ; Drive with Julia Lester (ABC Classic FM); Enough Rope ; The Glass House ; Grandstand ; Grassroots ; Hackers ; Jazztrack with Jim McLeod; Life Matters ; Love Letters from a War ; Marking Time ; New Dimensions ; Opera Outback ; Platypus: World's Strangest Animal ; Rural Legends ; Shipwreck Detectives ; Stateline WA ; Sunday Morning with Julie Copeland; Surfing the Menu ; the repeat of Taim Bilong Masta ; Trauma and Wildness .

Mr Don Benjamin of New South Wales complained that Health Matters (ABC Health Online), Health Minutes (ABC Radio) and The Health Report (Radio National) all advanced the orthodox view onmammography. During discussion of the efficacy ofscreening for breast cancer, none referred to a studyby the Danish Nordic Cochrane Group questioningthe efficacy of mammograms. The ICRP found this to be an extremely difficult issue to adjudicate. The Panel concluded that theCancer Information and Support Society, of which Mr Benjamin is the Convenor, and the Danish findingshad not been represented in the debate. However, it also noted that Professor Alan Coates, ChiefExecutive of the Cancer Council of Australia, hadclaimed that the Danish study was flawed and madea plea for it to be ignored, lest it undermine Australia's$50 million screening program. The ICRP concluded that a debate where each side to the issue had its argument comprehensivelypresented would redress any bias perceived so far inABC coverage. The Panel ruled that there was bias in the presentation of this issue, mitigated to someextent by the concern of the ABC that repudiation oforthodox treatment might lead to serious outcomes. In his capacity as Editor-in-Chief, Managing Director Russell Balding, wrote to the complainant to informhim that he had requested the ABC's Director ofRadio ensure due consideration be given to includingkey stakeholders in any future coverage of the issue. Senator the Hon. Richard Alston, the then Minister for Communications, Information Technology and theArts, complained about 68 instances of alleged biasand anti-American coverage by the ABC's radio newsand current affairs program AM. The complaints were originally reviewed by the ABC Complaints Review Executive (CRE), who upheld two of them. When the Minister expressed publicdissatisfaction with the outcome, Managing Director,Russell Balding, requested the ICRP further reviewthe complaint, as provided for in section 12.6.3 of the ABC Editorial Policies . Having considered the original 68 complaints, the ABC's determination, and the Minister's rebuttal of theABC's defence, the ICRP upheld 17 complaints in all.However, the Panel found no evidence, overall, ofbiased and anti-Coalition coverage as alleged by theMinister, nor did it uphold his view that the programwas characterised by one-sided and tendentiouscommentary by program presenters and reporters. In relation to 12 of the complaints, the Panel found that, within an individual broadcast, one or morestatements by a presenter or a reporter displayedserious bias. In relation to a further four complaints, the Panel identified breaches of an ABC Editorial directiverequiring presenters or reporters to refrain from'emotional language or editorialisation' in reporting on the war. In relation to a further complaint the Panel found that sources were not been identifiedadequately. However, in none of these five instancesdid the Panel consider that the individual broadcast,taken as a whole, displayed bias against the USA or the Coalition. These instances aside, the Panel believed that the AMcoverage of the war was competent and balanced. It concluded that 'the analysis andinterpretive reporting, the program's raison d'etre,added up to a professional painting of word pictures,often by eye witnesses, which allowed the listener tograsp what was happening on the battlefields and inthe war rooms of a controversial conflict'. Managing Director, Russell Balding, accepted the ICRP's findings and noted that they had found no evidence overall of biased and anti-Americancoverage. He instructed senior News and CurrentAffairs management to take note of the ICRP review,particularly in relation to the upheld complaints. Mr Ivan Somers of New South Wales complained that the program The National Interest broadcast on 20 April 2003 was in breach of paragraph 2.4 of the ABC Code of Practice , which deals with discrimination. Mr Somers alleged that the Code had been breached as a result of statements on thesubject of religion and war made by the AnglicanBishop to the Defence Forces, Bishop Tom Frame in conversation with ABC presenter Terry Lane. The ICRP's remit does not permit it to make determinations in relation to the ABC's Code of Practice . However, as this was also a complaint of serious bias, the Panel accepted it for review. The ICRP concluded that Bishop Frame's statement displayed serious bias, but was the view of theBishop himself and not of the ABC; the discussionwith Terry Lane was wide-ranging and the Bishopoffered other contentious opinions. The Panel did not uphold the complaint. Mr Russell Miller of Western Australia complained of 'unprofessional and possibly misleading conductby ABC Radio' in the 10pm news bulletin broadcaston 27 January 2003. In the bulletin, a Radio 720broadcaster reported that 'in news just in police sayone person is missing after a rock-fall in a mine atLeinster'. As Mr Miller had a son working underground at the Leinster mine, he rang to check on the young man'ssafety only to find no rock-fall had occurred. It lateremerged the accident happened at the Lawler mineapproximately 30 kilometres away. Mr Miller said theABC had 'jumped the gun' and rushed the item to air before checking the facts. The information for the news story was supplied by the Police Communications Duty Inspector at PerthCentral and was corrected after further calls to thePolice that night. The ICRP noted that 'in a written response to theAppendix 18 - Independent Complaints Review Panelcomplainant six weeks later, the ABC agreed there had been an inaccuracy in the 2200 news bulletin,expressed its regret and pointed out that correct and updated information on the rock-fall had beenbroadcast in news bulletins 50 minutes later andafterwards during the evening.' As the Panel found that the Perth newsroom had followed this updating procedure in accordance with the ABC Editorial Policies , the complaint was not upheld. Mr Eugene Herbert of New South Wales complained that ABC Media Watch presenter David Marr had been biased when making comment onone of the 68 complaints made about AMby the then Minister for Communications, Information Technologyand the Arts, Senator the Hon. Richard Alston. One specific complaint referred to the statement by AMthat 'the Bush Administration concedes' that the voice in a tape released in Baghdad soon after thestart of the war was that of Saddam Hussein. Senator Alston claimed that AMshould have used the word 'says' or 'believes' instead of 'concedes'. On Media Watch , Mr Marr, having outlined these matters, said: 'I'm not joking. Nor, sadly, is he[Senator Alston].' Mr Herbert alleged that Mr Marr was both biased and contemptuous of tone. He argued that since theBush Administration had never denied that the voicemight be that of Saddam Hussein there was noconcession in saying that it was; and further that it was 'highly inappropriate' of Media Watch to comment at all on the AMbroadcast as Senator Alston's complaints had been referred forinvestigation. The Panel dismissed Mr Herbert's complaint. It held the word 'concedes' to be 'appropriate in thecontext of' the AMbroadcast and did not consider it inappropriate for Media Watch to have commented on the matters raised by the Senator's complaints.Appendix 18 - Independent Complaints Review Panel (continued)173 ABC Annual Report AppendicesAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2004 The Freedom of Information Act 1982 ('FOI Act') gives the public the right to access documents heldby the ABC. Part II of Schedule 2 of the Act gives theABC an exemption in relation to material that isprogram related. During the past year the ABC dealt with twenty-fiverequests for access to documents under the FOI Act. Two requests were granted in full, eleven in part, and eleven were refused. One remained outstanding.Four requests proceeded to an internal review inwhich the exemptions claimed were upheld, exceptfor one document that was released.Appendix 19 - Freedom of Information Important note: this edition of the ABC Code of Practice applied throughout the 2003-04 reporting period. It was replaced on 1 July 2004 by a revisededition. The new Code of Practice is available online at <http://abc.net.au/corp/codeprac04.htm>. 1. Preamble The ABC's place in the broadcasting system is distinctive because of its Charter, which gives theCorporation unique responsibilities, and because ofother provisions under the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 ('ABC Act'), which give the Corporation particular responsibilities, for example,the provision of an independent news service. The ABC Act guarantees the editorial independence of the Corporation's program services. The ABC holdsits power to make programming decisions on behalfof the people of Australia. By law and convention neither the Government nor Parliament seeks to intervene in those decisions. 2.

However, the use of language and images for no other purpose but to offend is not acceptable. The code is not intended to ban certain types of language or images from bona fide dramatic or literarytreatments, nor is it intended to exclude such referencesfrom legitimate reportage, debate or documentaries.Where appropriate, audiences will be given advancenotice of the content of the program. 2.1 Violence Particular care must be taken in the presentation or portrayal of violence. The presentation or portrayal ofviolence must be justifi able, or el se the material should not be presented. In news and current affairs programs, violent events should never be sensationalised or presented fortheir own sake. In drama programs, the aim is not to see how much violence will be tolerated, but how little is necessary toachieve honest ends without undue dramatic compromise. 2.2 Language Variations of language favoured by different groups ofAustralians are valid and have their place in programs.Appendix 20 - ABC Code of Practice for Broadcast Programs (as at 30 June 2004)174 ABC Annual Report AppendicesAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2004 On occasions, the language of one group may be distasteful to another. Use of such language is permitted provided it is not used gratuitously andprovided the language can be justified in the contextof, for example, news and current affairs reporting,fiction, documentary, dramatisation, comedy andsong lyrics. 2.3 Sex and Sexuality Provided it is handled with integrity, any of the followingtreatments of sex and sexuality may be appropriateand necessary to a program: it can be discussed and reported in the context of news, information or documentary programs; it can be referred to in drama, comedy, lyrics or fictional programs; and it can be depicted, implicitly or explicitly. 2.4 Discrimination To avoid discrimination programs should not uselanguage or images in a way which is likely to disparage or discriminate against any person orsection of the community on account of race, ethnicity,nationality, sex, marital or parental status, age, disabilityor illness, social or occupational status, sexual preference or any religious, cultural or political beliefor activity. The requirement is not intended to preventthe broadcast of material which is factual, or theexpression of genuinely-held opinion in a news orcurrent affairs program, or in the legitimate context of a humorous, satirical or dramatic work. 2.5 Privacy The rights of individuals to privacy should be respectedin all ABC programs. However, in order to provideinformation which relates to a person's performance of public duties or about other matters of public interest,intrusions upon privacy may, in some cir cumstances, be justified. 3. Specific Program Codes 3.1 Children's Programs While the real world should not be concealed fromchildren, special care will be taken to ensure programschildren are likely to watch unsupervised will notcause alarm or distress. 3.2 Religious Programs Religious programs include coverage, explanation,analysis, debate and reports about major religious traditions, indigenous religi ons, new and innovative spiritual movements as well as secular perspectives on religious issues. It does not promote any particularbelief system or form of religious expression. 3.3 Indigenous Programs Program makers and journalists should respectAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures.Particular care should be exercised in the coverageof traditional cultural practices such as thenaming or depicting of the deceased. 3.5 Closed Captioning for People who are Hearing Impaired or Deaf Closed caption programs will be clearly marked when program information is provided to the press or when captioned programs are promoted. Where possible,open captioned advice will be provided if technical problems prevent scheduled closed captioning. Television programs broadcast in prime time (6pm-10.30pm) and news and current affairsprograms br oadcast at any time are captioned in accordance with the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (as amended). Addr esses to the nation and events of national significance will be transmitted with closedcaptioning. The ABC will endeavour to increasethe amount of closed-captioning programming, as resources permit. 3.6 Accessible Television for People who are Blind or Have a Visual Impairment or Limited Reading Comprehension Where material appears in text format on the screen, the ABC will endeavour to provide it in audio as well,subject to availability of resources and considerationsof creativity, editorial integrity and immediacy. 4. News and Current Affairs Programs This section applies to all programs produced bythe News and Current Affairs Division of the ABC andother information programs that comprise both newsand information relating to current events. ABC programs with significant factual content which donot comprise both news and information relating tocurrent events are dealt with in section 5 below. 4.1Every reasonable effort must be made to ensure that the factual content of news and current affairsprograms is accurate. Demonstrable errors will becorrected in a timely manner and in a form most suited to the circumstances. 4.2Every reasonable effort must be made to ensure that programs are balanced and impartial. The commitment to balance and impartiality requires that editorial staff present a wide range of perspectivesand not unduly favour one over the others. But itdoes not require them to be unquestioning, nor togive all sides of an issue the same amount of time. 4.3Balance will be sought through the presentation, as far as possible, of principal relevant viewpoints on matters of importance. This requirement may notalways be reached within a single program or newsbulletin but will be achieved as soon as possible. 4.4Editorial staff will not be obliged to disclose confidential sources which they are entitled to protect at all times. 4.5Re-enactments of events will be clearly identified as such and presented in a way which will not mislead audiences. 4.6If reported at all, suicides will be reported in moderate terms and will usually avoid details of method. 4.7Sensitivity will be exercised in broadcasting images of or interviews with bereaved relatives andsurvivors or witnesses of traumatic incidents.

Inorder to provide such a range of views the ABC maybroadcast programs which explore, or are presentedfrom, particular points of view. 5.2Every effort must be made to ensure that the factual content of such programs is accurate and incontext and does not misrepresent viewpoints. 5.3Demonstrable errors of fact will be corrected in a timely manner and in a form most suited to the circumstances. 5.4Editorial staff will not be obliged to disclose confidential sources which they are entitled to protect at all times. 6. Promotions for Programs Program promotions will be scheduled so as to beconsistent with the nature of surrounding programs. 7. Warnings Where appropriate, the audience will be given advancenotice of programs or program segments which someviewers or listeners could find distressing or disturbing. 8. Television Program Classifications This system of television program classificationapplies the Guidelines for the Classification of Filmsand Videotapes issued by the Office of Film andLiterature Classification and current at the time ofpublication of this Code of Practice . Programs having a particular classification under the Office of Film and Literature Classification Guidelinesmay be modified so that they are suitable for broadcastor suitable for broadcast at particular times. 8.1 Classification G\u2014General (suitable for all ages) Gprograms, which include programs designed for pre-school and school age children:- are suitable for children to watch on their own;- may be shown at any time.PG\u2014Parental Guidance (parental guidance recommended for persons under 15 years) PG programs:- may contain adult themes and concepts which, when viewed by those under 15 years, may require the guidance of an adult; - may be shown between 8.30am and 4.00pm on weekdays 7.30pm and 6.00am on any day of the week. M\u2014Mature Audience programs and MA\u2014Mature Adult Audience programs - are programs which, because of the matter they contain or because of the way it is treated, are recommended for viewing only by persons aged 15 years or over. M programs may be shown between: noon and 3.00pm on weekdays that are school days 8.30pm and 5.00am on any day of the week. MAprograms may be shown between: 9.30pm and 5.00am on any day of the week.

There must be sound reasons for any departure from the time zone for a program classification. Programs which are serious presentations of moral, social or cultural issues, may appear outside theirnormal classification period provided that a clearindication of the nature and content of the program is given at its commencement. 8.3 Television Classification Symbols The classification symbol of the PG, M or MA program(except news, current affairs, sporting and generalinformation programs other than documentaries)being shown will be displayed at the commencement of the program.Appendix 20 - ABC Code of Practice for Broadcast Programs (cont.)175 ABC Annual Report AppendicesAppendices for the year ended 30 June 2004The classification symbol of the PG, M or MA program (except news, current affairs, sporting and generalinformation programs other than documentaries) beingpromoted will be displayed during the promotion. 8.4 Consumer Advice Audio and visual consumer ad vice on the reasons for an M or MA classification will be given prior to the commencement of an M or MA program. 9.
