Within this tissue is a network o f lobes , which are made up of small, tube-like structures called lobules that contain milk glands. Tiny du cts connect the glands, lobules, and lobes, carrying the milk from the lobes to the nipple, located in the midd le of t he areola (d arker area that surroun ds the nipple). Blood and lymph vessels also run throughout the breast. Blo od nourish es the cells, and the lymphatic system drains bodily waste products. The lymph vessels conn ect to lymph n odes, wh ich are tiny, bean-shaped organs that help fight infection. Breast Cancer Development In the Unite d States, breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women (exclud ing skin cancer). Men may also develop breast cance r, but less than 1% of all people with breast cancer are men. Breast cancer begins when healthy cells in the breast change and grow uncontrollabl y, forming a mass called a tumo r. A tumor can be benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous). A benig n tumor does not spread to other parts of the body and is rarely life-threatening. A malignant tumo r, on the other hand, can spread beyond where it began to other parts of the bod y. Most breast cancers start in the ducts, but some begin in the lobules. Almo st 75% of all breast cancers begin in the cells lining the milk ducts and are called ductal carcinomas. Cancer that b egins in the lo bules is called lobular carcinoma. The difference between ductal and lobular cancer is determined by the pathologist (a doctor who specializes in interpreting laboratory tests and evaluating cells, tissues, and organs to diagnose disease) after examining a piece of the tumor removed during a biops y. If the disease has spread outside the duct or lobule and into the surrounding tissue, it is called invasive or infiltratin g ductal or lobular carcinoma. Cancer that is located only in the duct or lobule is called in situ, meaning \"in place.\" Most in situ breast cancers are ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Currently, oncologists recommend surgery to remove DCIS to help prevent the cancer from becoming an invasive breast cancer and spreading to other parts of the breast or the body. Radiation therapy and hormonal therapy may also be recommended for DCIS. < BACK TO CONTENTSLobu lar carcinoma is situ (LCIS) is not considered canc er and is usually monitored by the doctor. LCIS in one breast is a risk factor for developing invasive breast cancer in either breast. Other less common types of breast cancer include medullary, mucinous, tubular, metaplastic, and papillary breast cancer, as well as other even rarer types. Inflammatory breast cancer is a faster growing type of cancer that accounts for about 1% to 5% of all breast cancers. It may be misdiagnosed as a breast infection because there is often swelling of the breast and redness of the breast skin that starts suddenly. Paget's disease is a type of cancer that begins in the ducts of the nipple. The skin often appears scaly and may be itchy. Although it is usually in situ, it can also be invasive cancer. These rarer types of breast cancer are not covered in this guide, but information about them can be found at www.cancer.net/cancer-types.Breast Cancer Spread As a cancerous breast tumor grows, cancer cells may break away and be carried to other parts of the body by the bloodstream or lymphatic system. During this process, known as metastasis, the cancer cells grow and develop into new tumors. One of the first places breast cancer usually spreads is to the regional lymph nodes under the arm. Breast cancer can also spread farther away from the breast to other parts of the bod y, such as t he bones, lungs, and liver. Less commo nly, breast cancer may spread to the brain. Howeve r, eve n if the cancer spreads, it is still named for the area where it began. For example, if breast cancer spreads to the lungs, it is called metastatic breast cance r, not lung cance r. No matter the size, location, whether the cancer has spread, or how far it has spread, breast cancer can be treated and /or managed. 02.02BREAST CANCER BASICS Medical illustrations for many types of cancer are available at www.cancer.gov. < BACK TO CONTENTS Neag Comprehensive Ca ncer Center Breast Nurse Nav igator Program.

Descriptions of possible tests follow. Some tests, such as a mammogram or ultrasound, look at your breast tissue from outside of your body. Other tests, such as biopsies, take a small sample of your breast tissue or fluid to look at your cells under a microscope. Accurate diagnosis is critical to effective treatment. Your health care team will take great care to diagnose exactly the type of breast cancer you have. That's because the choice of treatment depends on the characteristics of the tumor, how far it has progressed (\"stage\") and more. After your diagnostic tests have been performed, you will probably see a surgeon. Be sure to bring to your appointment the results of all of the diagnostic tests you have had, including films and written reports.Test Descriptions Mammogram: A mammogram is a low-dose digital 2D radiogr aph (X -ray) of the breast with computer assisted det ection (CAD). Some studies have shown CAD to have the potential to increase the sensitivity of screening mammogr aphy . With CAD, a computer marks areas of interest on the mammogram in order to call them to the attention of the radiologist who is reading the image. Tomosynthesis: Also currently available is 3D mam- mography in conjunction with 2D mammography/CAD: this is called tomosynthesis. Health care providers should strongly consider recommending tomosynthesis for women with heterogeneously and extremely dense breasts. Tomosynthesis has a lower \"call back\" rate and has a higher specificity for breast cancer when compared with 2D mammography. Ultrasound: A test in which sound waves are used to create a picture of the inside of your breast. A technician moves a handheld device over the outside of the breast. The device transmits information about the contents of a lump and whether these contents are solid or liquid. The test is painless and is usually very quick. This is typically used when the patient is younger than 30 or when a mammogram has been inconclusive. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): This scan is highly sensitive and may over-detect changes in breast tissue. It does, however, provide useful information when it is used along with other tests, such as mammogram and ultrasound, especially when those tests have been inconclusive. Among those for whom this test may be useful are women who have dense breasts or those who have an increased risk of breast cancer because of family or personal history. If your situation requires you to have an MRI, be sure to have it at a facility that can also perform MRI-guided biopsies (see biopsy descriptions next). That way, you can have a suspicious area biopsied at the same time you have the MRI. 03.03UNDERSTANDING YOUR DIAGNOSIS < BACK TO CONTENTSBiopsy: This is a procedure that removes cells from the body so they can be examined and analyzed by a pathologist. There are several types of biopsies. Which one(s) you have will depend on your specific condition. Core needle biopsy: This test is typically used when lumps appear on ultrasound, mammo- gram or MRI results, but are too small to feel by hand. This is usually done with local anesthesia. Once t he breast is numbed, the doctor uses either imaging technology to guide a needle to the abnormal area and take tissue samples. This needle acts like the puncher that's used to pierce ears. Several passes are usually done to make sure that e nough tissue is collected for pathology testing. Needle localized excisional biopsy: This test is also used when lumps appear on ultrasound or mammogram results, but are too small to feel by hand. In the X-ray department, your breast will be cleaned and numbed with a local anesthetic. The radiologist will use imaging to guide a wire to the lump. Once the wire is in place, you will go to the operatin g room where a surgeon will use the wire as a guide to surgically remove the abnormal tissue. Each test evaluates the tissue obtain ed fo r something different. Feel free to ask your doctor or nurse why a particular test is being conducted on you. 03.04UNDERSTANDING YOUR DIAGNOSIS < BACK TO CONTENTSUnderstanding Your Pathology Report After examination, testing and, in some cases, surgical removal of the tumor, your health care team will know a great deal more about your cancer. This information will appear on your pathology report. The findings that appear on the pathology report will help you and your health care team decide on the best course of treatment. The next few paragraphs will help you better understand the information you will see on the pathology report. Where It Is Breast tumors may begin in the cells of either the \"lobules,\" the structures that produce milk, or the \"ducts,\" the structures that carry milk from the lobules to the nipple. Noninvasive or Invasive Breast cancer is first identified as either noninvasive or invasive. Noninvasive (in situ) cancer is one that doesn't seem to be growing into surrounding tissue. About one in seven breast cancers is noninvasive. Noninvasive Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) - This type of cancer is in the breast ducts. It may becomeinvasive if not treated. For more information on DCIS seehttp:/ /imaginis.com/breasthealth/dcis.asphttp:/ /breastcancer.about.com/cs/dcis 03.05UNDERSTANDING YOUR DIAGNOSIS Ductal (DCIS) Normal breast with noninvasiv e ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in an enlarged cros s-section of the duct.

Basement membrane D. Lumen (center of duct) < BACK TO CONTENTSInvasive Invasive cancers are those that grow out of the ducts or lobules where they begin. Invasive cancers a re sometimes call \"infiltrating\" cancers. There are two main types of invasive breast cancers: *Invasive ductal carcinoma - This type begins in the ducts, but grows into the surrounding normal tissue inside the breast. It is the most commonform of invasive cancer, representing about 70percent of all cases. Depending on how the cellsof this cancer appear under the microscope, yourreport may describe them in different ways. Forexample: - Tubular cancer cells look like tubes -Medullary cancer looks like brain tissue -Mucinous cancer produces mucous -Papillary cancer has cells that form finger-like projections Invasive lobular carcinoma - This starts inside the lobules, but grows into the surrounding normal tissue in the breast. It is the second most common type, representing about 10 percent of breast cancer cases.

Ductal cancer cells breakingUncommon Forms of Breast Cancer In addition to the types of cancer mentioned before, there are some rare forms of breast cancer. These include inflammatory breast cancer (IBC), cystosarcoma phyllodes, Paget's disease and angiosarcoma. Inflammatory Breast Cancer (IBC) Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a somewhat rare form, accounting for 1 percent to 4 percent of all breast cancers. IBC is an advanced and aggressive breast cancer that travels through the lymphovascular system, causing blockage of the lymph vessels in the skin over the breast. This results in the breast having a red and swollen appearance. The skin may develop a thick, pitted appearance that resembles an orange peel and is referred to as \"peau d'orange.\" While IBC can occur at any age, the average age of those diagnosed is under the age of 45. It is impor- tant to note that not all breast cancer presents itself in the form of a lump. Symp toms of IBC include: Redness of the skin, such as a \"rash\" or sunburned appearance Nipple flattening or retraction Thickening or hardening of the skin Dimpling or pitted appearance Skin feels warm Increase in breast size, swelling Possible tenderness in the breast If you notice these symptoms, report them to a doctor immediately. Inflammatory breast cancer is considered the most aggressive form of breast cancer, and immediate treatment is needed after diagnosis. IBC is difficult to detect on a mammogram because the cancer does not typically form a lump that is easily seen with the standard technology available. Diagnosis will likely result from a biopsy. Current treatment usually involves initial chemo- therapy to stop the cancer from spreading and to reduce the mass. Additional treatments depend on the extent of the cancer and its response to initial chemotherapy, but these treatments usually involve surgery, radiation, and perhaps additional chemotherapy. IBC information provided by Susan Asci The \"Grade\" of the Cancer Experts use the term \"grade\" to describe how different the cancer cells are from normal cells. Your report may say the cancer is: Grade 1 - Cells ar e well-differentiated. That is, they look a lot like normal cells. These are usually slow-growing. Grade 2 - Cells ar e moderately differentiated. They do not look like normal cells. They growfaster than normal cells. Grade 3 - Cells ar e poorly differentiated. That is, they do not look at all like normal cells. They areusually fast-growing. 03.07UNDERSTANDING YOUR DIAGNOSIS < BACK TO CONTENTSThe Size of the Cancer The medical community measures cancers in centimeters (cm). A centimeter is roughly one-third of an inch. The size helps your health care team determine the \"stage\" of the cancer (see below). Margin When the breast cancer is surgically removed, the surgeon's goal is to remove the entire tumor and leave no cancer cells behind. So he/she removes an extra \"margin\" of normal tissue along with the cancer. The pathologist examines this margin carefully to determine if it is free of cancer cells. On your pathology report, the margin may be described in one of several ways: Negativ e or clean - No cancer cells are seen at the edge of the tissue. This usually means no additional surgery is needed. Positiv e - Cancer cells are seen right at the edge of the tissue. Additional surgery may be needed. Close - Canc er cells are close to the edge of the tissue. Additional surgery may be needed. Lymphatic or Vascular Invasion A network of blood vessels (vascular structures) and lymph channels carry fluids to and from breast tissue and other parts of the body. If cancer cells are found in these fluid channels, there is an increased risk that the cancer may return. Your pathology report will indicate whether lymphatic or vascular invasion is: Present - Cancer cells have been found; or Absent - Canc er cells have not been found.Estrogen Receptor (ER) and Progesterone Receptor (PR) These tests reflect whether a cancer responds to a woman's hormones. They give your health care team information about the likelihood that the cancer will respond to a form of treatment called hormonal manipulation. You may see one of these terms on your report: ER-positive - The cells have receptors for the hormone estrogen. ER-negativ e - The cells do not have receptors for estrogen. PR-positive - The cells have receptors for the hormone progesterone. PR-negativ e - The cells do not have receptors for the hormone progesterone. The report will also tell you the number of cells that have receptors. This may be expressed in one of two ways: As a perc entage - You will see a number between 0 percent (none has receptors) and 100 percent (all have receptors); or As a number between 0 and 3 - \"0\" indicates no receptors; \"1+\" indicates a small indicates a large number DIAGNOSIS < BACK TO CONTENTSHER-2/NEU HER-2/NEU (CerbB-2) is a receptor on the surface of cells. It regulates cell growth. Cancers with too many HE R-2 receptors tend to grow quickly and not respond well to hormone therap y. However, newer treatments that specifically target HER-2 are p roving very effect ive. Your pathology report will indicate your HER-2 status. It may be: Positive; Negative; or Borderline - Additional testing may be needed to clarify. Lymph Node Involvement Lymph nodes are located under your arm. They are filters along the lymph channels that carry lymph fluid from the breast back to the bloodstream. The pathologist will examine the lymph nodes removed along with the breast tissue to see if cancer cells are present in them. Your report may indicate that lymph nodes are: Negative - No cancer cells are seen in the lymphnodes; or Positive - Cancer cells are seen in the lymphnodes.Staging After the tests are done and the lab reports have determined what kind of breast cancer you have, your doctor will \"stage\" the tumor. The purpose of staging the tumor is to help determine your prospects for recovery and the best treatments for the stage of your disease. The stage tells how large your tumor is and how far the cancer has spread. Three letters are used in the staging of breast cancer: \"T\" - Stands for tumor characteristics, including tumor size and any involv ement of skin or the chest wall behind the breast. \"N\" - Stands for lymph nodes. It indicates how far the cancer has trav eled through the lymph nodes that drain the breast region. Lymph nodes are found under your arm and at other sites. \"M\" - Stands for metastasis, that is, whether cancer cells have traveled (metastasized) beyondyour breast and lymph node regions. Staging is complicated and should be discussed with your oncologist.

If there are other people with breast cancer in your family, you may wonder if your cancer is hereditary and whether your children or other relatives may also be at heightened risk. This section of the guide contains information that will help you better understand what is known so far about the connection between genes and breast cancer. It will also explain the role a genetic counselor may play in your evaluation and management plan. The Role of Genes Every cell in our bodies contains genes, tiny units of information that are passed along to us by our parents. Each of us inherits two copies of each gene. Each cell in our body has 20,000 to 40,000 genes. Genes direct the growth and development of our cells, and therefore of our bodies as a whole. In addition, most of our physical characteristics, such as the color of our eyes and skin, how tall we are and our blood type, are influenced by genes to some extent. An alteration or \"mutation\" in a gene is like a typographical error. When this genetic alteration is in a gene that controls cell growth, the \"error\" may enable cells to grow out of control. All cancers involve genetic alterations in a cell. The genetic alteration causes the cell to transform into a cancer cell that can eventually multiply and become a tumor. Genetic alterations that lead to cancer may develop in isolated cells during an individual's lifetime. These are called \"acquired\" or \"sporadic\" alterations. They are not passed on to future generations. Other genetic alterations are hereditary. That is, the alteration is already present in all of our cells when we are born and can be inherited by our children when the alteration is passed on in the sperm or egg. Hereditary Cancer Certain families have multiple members affected with cancer because of a specific inherited gene mutation. Individuals in these families may have a significantly increased risk of developing cancer. Only a small percentage (5 to 10 percent) of breast cancers can be traced to hereditary mutations. When cancer occurs in one or more close relatives, we may begin to suspect that it is not by chance. So 04.01GENETICS < BACK TO CONTENTSit is prudent to look into whether these occurrences might be hereditary. We will be more likely to suspect it is hereditary if the cancers are the same type (breast cancer, for example) or a particular combination of cancers (such as breast and ovarian cancers). Gene Mutations That Cause Hereditary Breast Cancer While only a small percentage of breast cancers are hereditary, the majority of them are due to hereditary mutations in two particular genes: BRCA1 and BRCA2. The abbreviations stand for breast cance r gene 1 and breast cancer gene 2. An even smalle r percentage are due to other hereditary gene mutations. For example, gene mutations in PTEN are associated with Cowden's syndrome, and gene mutations in TP53 are associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. The BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are ex amples of tumor suppressor genes. The role of tumor suppressor genes is to slow down cell division, repair DNA mistakes, and tell cells when to die naturally. We all possess these genes, having inherited one copy of each from each of our parents. Those of us who inherit an altered form of one of these genes are at higher risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer. The mutations in these genes may interfere with a cell's ability to put the brakes on its growth. Without the brakes, cells may grow out of control and begin the process of developing a tumor. For more information about the role of cells and genes, visit www.cancer.org and enter the search term, \"tumor suppressor genes.\" Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes increase the risk of developing both b reast cance r and ovarian c ancer. The medical community has identified risk factors that tend to indicate the presence of a BRCA mutation in a family. Signs of hereditary breast-ovarian cancer syndrome in a family include, but are not limited to: Breast cancer at age 50 or younger. Breast cancer in both breasts in a woman, when the first cancer occurred under 50. At least one family member with breast cancer under age 50 and one with ovarian cancer on thesame side of the family, or breast and ovariancancer in the same individual. Breast cancer in men. Ashkenazi Jewish heritage. Three or more close r elatives on the same side of the family with breast or ovarian cancers and one of these cancers: prostate cancer, pancreaticcancer or melanoma. Source: www.facingourrisk.org, the website of FORCE (Facing Our Risk of Cancer Empowered) It is important to know your family's health history, because it may help you and your health care team determine whether you have a hereditary risk for breast cancer. Discovering Your Family's Health History Families differ in how much information they know about the health of their relatives. Information about your closest relatives (parents, children, brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles, and grandparents) has the most impact on your cancer risk. If you don't know whether your relatives had cancer, you can speak with your health care provider to determine the specific information that might be the most use- 04.02GENETICS < BACK TO CONTENTSful. They can guide you to obtaining this information from numerous sources, including death certificates or the medical records from the hospitals where relatives were treated. Death certificates are public records and, while not perfect, usually list the cause of death. To get information about obtaining a copy of a death certificate, contact the city or town clerk in the community where your relative died or the Connecticut Department of Public Health's State Office of Vital Records (www.ct.gov/dph or 860-509-7700). Medical records are kept for varying lengths of time by different health care facilities. If you know the name of the hospital where your ancestor was treated, call the facility and ask how to obtain records. Make sure to get the name of the contact person you spoke with. Then write to the hospital's medical records department to request a copy of your relative's medical record and explain how you are related to that person. The executor of a relative's estate is often a good resource for requesting records. Be mindful that the records department may ask for a death certificate that documents the fact that the relative is deceased. This may seem like a lot of red tape, but the procedures are designed to protect the privacy of an individual's medical record. Under revised privacy rules put in place by the federal government in April 2003, you can still access protected health information for treatment purposes. Known as \"continuity of care,\" this rule allows a health care provider to disclose a decedent's health information, without authorization, to the health care provider treating the surviving relative. The executor of an estate may also obtain the information or authorize its disclosure. You can get information on how to access deceased relatives' health records at www.hhs.gov/ocr/hipaa/, the website of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' HIPAA program. At this site, click on \"Answers to Your Frequently Asked Questions.\" When the search engine appears, type in \"obtain medical records deceased.\" The first answer reviews how to access these records. A cancer-genetic counselor (described below) can also advise you on methods for discovering your family health history. Genetic Counseling If you are concerned about whether you have an inherited form of cancer, you may want to seek help from a genetic counselor. Genetic counselors are health professionals with advanced degrees and experience in medical genetics and counseling. When seeking to understand the genetics of breast cancer, you will want to select a genetic counselor with special expertise in cancer genetics. This professional can help you assess your risk of cancer 04.03GENETICS Adopted? If you're adopted, you can petition the court to release your birth record, or you can contact the Connecticut Adoption Registry (through the Connecticut Department of Children and Families) to see if your birth parent has registered to release information. < BACK TO CONTENTSand the likelihood that the cancers in your family are inherited. In addition, you will receive a personalized explanation of the benefits and limits of any available genetic testing. For assistance in finding a cancer genetic counselor in your area, ask your doctor or nurse or visit www.nsgc.org, the website of the National Society of Genetic Counselors. What Genetic Counseling Involves Genetic counseling begins with a discussion of your concerns and involves a detailed look at your family history. The genetic counselor asks questions about your relatives to obtain information about their current ages, their ages at death and whether they had cancer. It is important to record the type and location of cancer they had and at what age they developed cancer. You may be asked to bring in medical records and pathology reports for people in your family who had or have cancer, because these records often provide more detailed information. In the course of a genetic counseling visit, the coun- selor will provide more information about genetics and inherited cancer. You will also discuss cancer screening recommendations for the type of cancer you may be at risk of developing, based on your family histo ry. In families with inherited susceptibility to cancer, can cer screening is often started at an earlie r age and done more frequently than usual. You might feel overwhelmed by the volume and the details . Ask questions, take notes, and ask your counselor how you can find answers to questions that you think of after you leave. Take time to review any printed material or reports the counselor gives you. For additional information, visit the websites listed at the end of this chapter or consult your local librarian. Gene tic Testing If it appears that your family may have an inherited cancer susceptibilit y, your counselor will discuss with you the pros and cons of genetic testing. Genetic tests for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer are performed on blood in order to find genetic disorders. Because inherited cancer susceptibility accounts for abo ut 5 to 10 percent of breast cancers, genetic testing is usually offered to individuals who have a reasonable chance of having an altered cancer susceptibility gene. Genetic tests are available for some breast cancer susceptibility genes, including BRCA1, BRCA2, PTEN and TP53. Your genetic counselor will determine which test is most appropriate for your specific situation. Here are some questions to ask: Which specific mutations or genes will be analyzed? What are the potential risks, benefits and limitations of testing? How will my privac y be protected? Does insurance co ver the test? How much of my blood will be taken ? What will happen to the blood sample aft er testing is done? How can I obtain more information about my hereditary breast cancer risk? Who can I call for more information? 04.04GENETICS < BACK TO CONTENTSImplications of a Positive Test - If testing reveals that you have an altered cancer susceptibility gene, that means you have an increased chance (or risk) of developing cance r. Ris k is sometime s a difficult concept to grasp. Ask your cancer genet ic counselor as many q uestions as necessary to understand this idea. And remember that a genetic test result helps determine only some aspects of development of cancer in the future. Risks ap ply to groups of people, and statistics can't predict what will happen to one person. A higher risk does mean that something is more likely to happen, but it doesn't mean that it will happen. For example: the BRCA1 gene, if altered, causes a predisposition to breast and ovarian cance r. The likelihood that a woman with an altered BRCA1 gene will d evelop breast cancer is from 50 percent to 85 percent in her lifetime. While this is higher than the 11 percent risk faced by the average woman in the U.S., these numbers mean that some women with altered BRCA1 genes will not get breast cancer even though they carry a mutation. Another important fact to understand is that altered cancer susceptibility genes cause an increased risk of specific cancers \u2014 not all cancers. While women who have BRCA1 alterations have increased risks of breast and ovarian cancer, they do not, according to today's research, have a significantly greater risk of developing other cancers, such as leukemia, lymphoma or cervical cancer, than someone who does not have a BRCA1 alteration. What to Do if You Test Positive - If testing shows that you have an altered cancer susceptibility gene, talk with your genetic counselor and other health care providers about what it means. Next \u2014 and most importantly \u2014 make sure you know the options available to you for management as well as the recommended screening for cancer. You will most likely receive a written report about these recommendations from the genetic counselor. Most cancer susceptibility genes predispose individuals to specific types of cancers in specific organs of the body. Cancer monitoring should focus on those organs because, while cancer might not be preventable, treatment is most effective when it is caught early. 04.05GENETICS Informed Consent If you decide to have genetic testing, you'll be asked to sign a consent form that gives your permission to have your blood drawn and analyzed. The form may include many of the following points: < BACK TO CONTENTSReducing Your Risks - Some individuals with inherited predispositions to cancer who want to reduce their risk might choose to undergo prophylactic or risk-reducing surgery. (See Chapters seven and eight for more information about risk-reducing strategies.) Prophylactic surgery is the removal of healthy (non-cancerous) tissue before cancer develops. Prophylactic surgery, however, doesn't guarantee that cancer won't develop. For example, a woman who has an altered BRCA gene (and a high chance of getting breast cancer) may consider having her breasts removed (mastectomy) before a cancer develops. Prophylactic mastectomy, however, doesn't completely eliminate the possibility of developing breast cancer, because it is impossible to remove every single breast cell from a person's chest. These are issues to discuss with your health care providers, because a remaining risk for cancer may depend on a number of factors that are unique to you. Prophylactic surgery affects a person's body, mind and feelings. If you are considering this option, work with health care providers, family, and friends who can understand these different areas. Professionals who can help include your surgeon, plastic surgeon, oncologist, genetic counselor, nurse, mental health counselor and spiritual advisor. Health Insurance Considerations - Many people are concerned about experiencing genetic discrimination if they test positive for cancer susceptibility. Genetic discrimination is the use of genetic testing results by insurers or employers in an adverse way. However, on May 21, 2008, President Bush signed the Federal Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, or GINA. This legislation prohibits employers and health insurers from penalizing people without a cancer diagnosis for disease. Risks Revealed by Genetic Testing - It is important to note that life insurance and disability insurance companies may consider genetic information when making decisions regarding coverage. In addition, the Affordable Care Act prohibits insurance discrimination due to a preexisting condition. Genetic Testing: The Choice is Yours - Talk with your genetic counselor and team of health care providers about whether you want to find out if you have an altered cancer susceptibility gene. If you seem to be at risk of hereditary cancer, you should be closely monitored by medical professionals and screened frequently for cancer, even if you don't choose to have genetic testing. Your health care providers can give you specific screening recommendations based on your personal and family history. Most people who choose to be tested deal quite well with this new knowledge if they have gone through an appropriate process of evaluation and preparation for testing. 04.06GENETICS < BACK TO CONTENTSPanel Testing - Advances in genetic testing now allow t esting for many of the inherited breast cancer susceptibility genes a t one time. It is important to ask questions about the type of genetic testing you will undergo, how long it will take to get results, and how many genes are being analyzed. The most common genes in a breast cancer panel test include ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CDH1, CHEK2, PALB2, PTEN, TP53 and STK11. Sharing Information - Most people share their results with their families, because it helps family members better manage their own risks. If you have an altered cancer susceptibility gene, consider how you want to share this information with your famil y. Ask your genetics or mental health counselor f or advice on how to share such inf ormation. Most studies have shown that women share their genetic test results with their family members. W hat to Do if You Test Negative - You may test negative for a known hereditary mutation even though your family may seem to have many people with cance r. Remember that not all cancer is inherited. Y ou may want to keep in contact with the genetic counselor on a regular basis. Future research in the area of genetics may uncover other hereditary muta tions for which you'd want to be tested. The program may also have research opportunities: you might want to ask if they suit y our particular situation. As newer technologies emer ge, additional knowledge has pointed to other moderate-risk genes that increase breast cancer predisposition. Ask about whether additional testing may have a role for you or your famil y. What to Do if Your Test Shows a Variant of Uncertain Significanc e - Occasionally a DNA test will identify a genetic change that is not well defined. It may take months, or years, for the variant to be r eclassified as a harmless DNA change, or as a positive result with associated cancer risks. If your results show a variant of uncertain significance, it is important to keep in contact with your genetic counselor on a yearly basis.Additional Resources FORC E www.facingourrisk.org FORCE (Facing Our Risk of Cancer Empowered) provides information and initiatives to improve the lives of individuals and families affected by hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.

Connecticut Department of Public Health: http://www.ct.gov/dph/site/default.asp National Society of BACK TO CONTENTSLumpectomy A lumpectomy is the removal of the tumor with a rim of surrounding normal tissue. This tissue is examined by a pathologist, using a microscope, to see the extent of the cancer cells. If the cancer cells involve the edge of the tissue removed, a follow-up surgical procedure may be required to achieve a \"clean margin.\" A partial or segmental mastectomy or quadrantectomy is a lumpectomy in which a m argin of surrounding breast tissue is removed. Lumpectomy is generally followed by radiation therapy (five days a week for four to six weeks in most women) to decrease the chance of the cancer reappearing in the breast. Lumpectomy is not an option for all women with breast cancer. Factors that generally prohibit lumpectomy include: 1.The breast is small and the tumor is very large. Or the tumor extends so far within the breast thata clean, or clear margin cannot be achieved. 2.There is more than one tumor in the breast. 3. Other medical conditions, including pregnancy, prevent the woman from having radiation therapy. 05a.01PERSONALIZED TREATMENT: SURGERY Local Surgical Treatment < BACK TO CONTENTS The goal of lumpectomy is to preserve the appearance of the breast. Oncoplastic technicques can often be used to help with this. Some women may have the option to try to shrink the tumor with chemotherapy prior to surgery so they are able to have a lumpectom y. In addition, some women may opt for mastectom y, with or witho ut reconstruction, for personal reasons. Surg ery for the Axil lary Lymph Node The lymp h nodes under the arm nearest the breast are known as the axillary lymph node s. It is extremely importan t to know if cancer cells have left the breast and spread to those nodes. That is why the standard treatment since the 1980s has been the axillary lymp h node dissection, and more recentl y, a sentine l node biopsy.Sentinel Node Biopsy Of particular interest to doctors is the sentinel node. It is thought that cancer cells may invade it first as lymph flows from the breast through it to the other lymph nodes. Sentinel node biopsy is the preferred method of evaluation of lymph node spread that may not be obvious through a clinical exam. For invasive cancer, or some, non-invasive cancers, sentinel node biopsy is recommended so that the lymph nodes can be evaluated. This minor surgery is usually performed on an outpatient basis using general anesthesia. The procedure begins with the injection of a radiotracer material and/or blue dye into the area around the breast tumor. The first one to three lymph nodes to receive the dye are removed and tested by a pathologist to determine whether cancer cells are spreading from the tumor or lymph system. This procedure should be performed only by a specially trained and experienced surgeon. Women having a lumpectomy and radiation therapy who have a smaller tumor and no more than two sentinel lymph nodes with cancer may avoid a full axillary lymph node dissection, which helps reduce the risk of side effects and does not decrease survival. With a full lymph node dissection, 10 to 30 of the approximately 40 lymph nodes under the arm are removed. Those nodes are studied under a microscope to determine if breast cancer cells are present. After the nodes are removed, the patient usually leaves the hospital with a drain in place for a few days and has minimal discomfort. Side Effects of Lymph Node Removal After the lymph nodes are removed, you may experience numbness of the armpit and upper inner arm skin. Another, less common side effect is lymphedema (swelling of the arm). There are ways to help prevent or reduce the effects of lymphedema. If you are experiencing swelling, tightness or pain in your arm, you should tell your doctor or nurse immediately. This can happen immediately after removal of underarm lymph nodes or years later. Mastectomy A mastectomy is removal of the entire breast and, possibly, adjacent tissue. Patients undergoing mastectomy are anesthetized during the procedure. They may go home soon after the operation or they may remain in the hospital for a few days. However, if they opt to have breast reconstruction done at the same time as the mastectomy that may extend their hospital stay. If you have a mastectomy you may feel pain that usually improves in a few weeks. The pain can be treated with medication. Drains are usually placed that will remain for a few weeks. You may experience some stiffness in the area of the surgery. It is also possible that fluid will build up in the area, increasing the possibility of infection. 05a.02PERSONALIZED TREATMENT: SURGERY < BACK TO CONTENTSWomen who undergo mastectomy can also experience some long-term side effects: loss of feeling or sensation is common. Tenderness usually gets better in a few weeks. Loss of feeling, on the other hand, can last for an extended period. No one undergoing mastectomy should expect an immediate recovery. The process of getting back to \"normal\" can take weeks or even months. 05a.03PERSONALIZED TREATMENT: SURGERY < BACK TO CONTENTS Breast Reconstruction After Mastectomy Breast reconstruction is an important part of the overall care plan for women affected by breast cancer. It is normal for you to feel stressed, anxious, and even mournful over the loss of your breast. Many people are fearful about the effect of mastectomy on their body image, sexuality, appearance in clothes, and self-confidence. Breast reconstruction after mastectomy or lumpectomy provides women with the opportunity to restore their aesthetic appearance and improve their quality of life while simultaneously proceeding with ongoing cancer treatment such as radiation, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy. Breast reconstruction after mastectomy can either take place at the same time as mastectomy (immediate) or after you have healed from your mastectomy (delayed). In most situations, patients are able to undergo reconstructive surgery immediately following their mastectomy. This requires coordination with your breast surgeon as well as your plastic and reconstructive surgeon who will tailor your surgeries specifically to your needs and wishes. Generally speaking, breast reconstruction after mastectomy falls into two categories: reconstruction with breast implants, or reconstruction using the patient's own tissue. Implant-Based Breast Reconstruction In reconstruction using breast implants, patients who have had their skin and nipple removed during the mastectomy require a temporary implant, called a tissue expander, placed underneath the pectoralis muscle. In order to provide additional support and coverage of the tissue expander, a biologic material made from protein from human skin is used to form an internal sling to secure the lower part of the tissue expander. This requires a 1-2 night hospital stay after surgery. After a suitable recovery period, you will return to the office on a regular basis to have additional saline injected into the tissue expander. This process slowly stretches and expands the remaining breast skin over time. Once the skin has been expanded to the patient's desired size, an operation is required to remove the tissue expander and place a permanent breast implant. This is typically a day surgery under general anesthesia, which does not require an overnight hospital stay. For patients who are having nipple-sparing mastectomies, during which the nipples and breast skin is not removed, it may be possible to have immediate reconstruction with breast implants instead of using tissue expanders. 05a.04PERSONALIZED TREATMENT: SURGERY < BACK TO CONTENTS Flap Breast Reconstruction The other reconstructive option following mastectomy is replacement of the breast tissue with a \"flap\" of muscle, fat and skin from another location on the patient's body. There are many different \"donor sites\" for flap reconstruction, but most commonly the abdominal muscles or the latissimus muscle from the back are used to form a reconstructed breast. While these operations have the advantage of not always requiring breast implants, they do require additional scars and at times reduced strength in the donor site where the muscle was taken from. These operations can also be done immediately after mastectomy, however the surgery is longer in duration and typically requires a longer hospital stay. At the time of consultation, your plastic surgeon will discuss the many options regarding implant-based and flap reconstruction and help you to determine the best option for you. Regardless of whether you choose implant- based or flap reconstruction, it often takes several surgeries to reconstruct the breasts with an appealing aesthetic result. These operations are spread out over time and in coordination with your need for radiation or chemotherapy. Prostheses In the event that you are unable or decide not to undergo breast reconstruction, you may want to consider using an external breast prosthesis. This is an artificial breast form that you can attach to your body or place in your bra, lingerie or swimwear. Breast prostheses come in a variety of shapes and weights, which are designed to accommodate the needs and shapes of the women who wear them. A professional prosthesis fitter will help you choose the correct shape in order to distribute the weight of the prosthesis evenly against your body for anatomical fit and ideal contour. The silicone breast forms are available in multiple skin tones. You can choose to purchase surgical support bras to hold the prosthesis or have a traditional bra or swimsuit customized to accommodate your prosthesis. Breast prostheses require a prescription and are typically covered by insurance. Breast Reconstruction After Lumpectomy In patients who opt to undergo breast- conserving therapy with lumpectomy and radiation, it is possible to have surgery to help restore symmetry and to improve the appearance of the reconstructed breast. Radiation therapy causes the affected breast skin to tighten and often sit higher on the chest compared to the unaffected breast. A mastopexy, or breast lift, or even a small breast reduction can be done to the opposite side in order to make the breasts as symmetrical as possible. It is also possible to perform fat grafting, which is injection of fat that has been removed from another part of your body by liposuction, into areas where there is dimpling of the breast from scar tissue and radiation effects on the breast where the cancer was removed. In women with large breasts who require lumpectomy, this can be completed as part of a breast reduction procedure in a collaborative effort with your breast surgeon and your plastic surgeon.Rehabilitation Following surgery for breast cancer, you will likely experience some pain or discomfort in the breast area, possibly accompanied by numbness or tingling in the arm. You may also have discomfort under your arm where the lymph nodes were removed. This discomfort can take several forms. You may experience pain that radiates down the arm, or you may feel as though \"pins and needles\" are sticking you. Additionall y, your arm may feel numb. Pain from the incision usually takes about a week to ten days to subside, and the sensations will improve as your arm mobility is restored. There are exercises that you can do to relieve your discomfort and restore your range of arm move- ment. Ask your doctor about recommended thera- pies and when you can begin exercises. You should not lift anything heavy or begin any exercises until your doctor has given you the permission to do so. You will meet with a physical therapist who special-izes in lymphedema. The therapist will review the exercises and let you know what symptoms to look for. 05a.05PERSONALIZED TREATMENT: SURGERY Questions to Ask the Doctor about Surgery Am I a candidate for a lumpectom y? Why or why not? If I have a lumpectomy , will my breast differ in size and shape compared to my other breast? If I have a lumpectomy , will I be able to breastfeed if I have a child in the future? Do I need to have a mast ectomy? If so, would you recommend immediate breast reconstruction (plastic surgery)? What arethe advantages and disadvantages? Do the lymph nodes under my arm need tobe remov ed? Do you recommend a sentinel lymph node biopsy? If not, do you recom-mend an axillary lymph node dissectioninstead? Will I need to be admitted to a hospital f or this operation? If so, how long will I need tostay in the hospital? Am I at risk for developing lymphedema ? If so, how can we reduce this risk? Where will the scar be, and what will itlook lik e? What kind of pain will I be in after surgery ? What can be done to manage this pain? Will my arm be affected b y surgery? If so, for how long? Will I need physical therapy? < BACK TO CONTENTSRadiation Treatment Radiation therapy uses precisely directed and calibrated x-rays in an attempt to eliminate cancer cells that may remain after surgical removal of a breast tumor. Radiation is most commonly used after limited breast surg ery (lumpectomy). In selected cases it may be recommended to treat the chest wall after total removal of the breast (mastectomy). T here may be indications in certain patients to co nsider treatment of the lymph nodes under the arm (axilla), chest bo ne (internal mammary), and the collarbon e (supraclavicular area). Whole breast radiation has been the standard technique used after lumpectomy for over 30 years and it has a proven long-term track record for efficacy and safety. It involves daily treatment, M onday-Friday, generally for a total of three to s ix weeks. This treatment course often includes a lumpectomy boost treatment which is given daily over the last one or two weeks of the treatment c ourse. The radiation boost is directed only to the l umpectomy area and spares the other areas of the breast at that point. Robust data indicates that a shorter overall radiation course of 3 to 4.5 weeks (hypofractionation) is a r easonable alternative to the traditional 6-week t reatment program for many patients. Some patients may benefit from being treated in a prone position (lying on stomach) as opposed to the more standard supine position (lying on back). Patients receiving left sided treatment may also benefit from a Deep Inspiration Breath Hold (DIBH) technique where the patient is treated while hold a deep breath. In many instances these techniques may allow lower chest wall, lu ng and heart radiation exposure.Common side effects of treatment observed during the radiation course include fatigue, skin and nipple redness and breast irritation. Before the initiation of t reatment planning, your radiation oncologist will h ave a thorough discussion with you concerning t he possible acute effects of the radiation as well as p otential long-term permanent issues. Partial breast irradiation (PBI) is an alternative technique that involves the use of a radioactive source placed in the lumpectomy cavity as an alternative to whole breast radiation. A plastic catheter may be placed in the lumpectomy cavity by your surgeon at the time of the breast tumor removal. 05b.01PERSONALIZED TREATMENT: RADIATION < BACK TO CONTENTS05b.02PERSONALIZED TREATMENT: RADIATION < BACK TO CONTENTS PBI involves twice a day treatment over about a week. The catheter exits the skin and must remain in place during the entire treatment course. The technique does spare some of the breast tissue from exposure to radiation, but is only indicated in some patients, with the decision largely based on tumor characteristics and patient age. Preparing for Radiation Treatment In order to fully inform you of the benefits and side effects of radiotherapy, you will have a consultation with a radiation oncologist who will be in charge of your care if you choose to proceed with radiation treatments. A treatment planning session, called a simulation, will be scheduled as the next step. This simulation process involves positioning your body on the treatment table to assure optimal geometry for treatment as well as reproducibility of your body position for the subsequent treatments. Three small permanent marks (tattoos) will be placed on your skin as a guide for accurate dellivery of the radiation during your daily treatments. A CT scan will be done of the breast area during the simulation, to provide an accurate three- dimensional representation of your breast anatomy, as well as the heart and lung tissue. The radiation plan will be formulated to minimize treatment of your normal tissues. This advanced technology allows your physician to work with the physics staff to produce a radiation plan that limits side effects. When you initiate treatment your physician and the nursing staff will advise you on proper skin care.Systemic Therapy Surgery and radiation treat the cancer found in the breast and local lymph nodes. Unfortunately, the cancer can spread beyond the local area. This spread is often minute and cannot be seen by any studies or found in a blood test. In order to eliminate these small deposits, systemic therapies are utilized. This is called adjuvant therap y. Sometime s your treating physicians may choose to initiate this therapy even before surger y. This is called neoadjuvant therapy. Adjuvant systemic therapies can include chemotherapy, anti-estrogen therapy, and/or biologic therapy. The choice of one or more of these depends on the characteristics of each person's own breast cancer. The tailoring of treatment to individual patients is a goal for all providers. Clearly, \"one treatment does not fit all,\" but deciding who needs which systemic treatments can be complicated. Your physician and care team will consider issues such as the size of your tumor, the presence of positive lymph nodes, the tumor grade and receptor status as well as more personalized characteristics of your cancer, the e xpress ion of certain genes that may drive its growth and spread. The Oncotype DX is a test created for women with estrogen-positive breast cancer that looks at a gene pattern in a patient's own breast cancer. A score is generated from which therapy with anti-estrogens, chemotherapy or both can then be recommended. This test has reduced the use of chemotherapy on women who would not benefit from it. This is not a test for all women with breast cancer, but your doctor may mention it or you may want to ask more about it. Because these drugs may hurt normal cells, you may experience some side effects. Some side effects include loss of energy and fatigue, hair loss, nausea and vomiting, infection and bleeding. Many of these are either prevented or well-managed with supportive treatments. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy for breast cancer is one or more drug(s) given through an intravenous line or taken by mouth in pill form. Patients receiving chemo-therapy for breast cancer most often do so as an outpatient, either in the outpatient department of a hospital or at a doctor's private office. Chemotherapy attacks cells, especially those that reproduce rapidly, such as cancer cells. As a treatment that is dispersed to the whole body, the chemotherapy drugs can't be selective about which cells are attacked. Normal cells, particularly those growing quickly like the mother cells of our blood cells and those found in our mouth and digestive tract, can also be affected by these drugs. Blood Counts Your doctor will monitor your blood cells during chemotherapy through a laboratory test called a complete blood count (CBC). The test checks the levels of your red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. It helps the doctor gauge how much chemo you can tolerate at that particular time. Red blood cells carry oxygen throughout your body. A reduction of those cells can cause fatigue. When your red cell count is too low, you may also have difficulty breathing or feel dizzy when you stand up quickly. Red blood cells live from three to four months in your body, so the effects of chemotherapy are likely to be minimal on this part of your blood. 05c.01PERSONALIZED TREATMENT: SYSTEMIC THERAPY < BACK TO CONTENTSStill, if you have symptoms, tell your oncology nurse. White blood cells are responsible for fighting infections. After you receive chemotherapy, the number of white cells in your blood may be low, making you susceptible to infections. When that happens, it's important for you to: Stay away fr om people who have colds, flu, or other infections. Keep your skin warm, dry, and clean, and take car e of cuts or breaks in your skin by washing them thoroughly. Tell your nurse or doctor if you cat ch a cold or other infection. Check with your doctor about eating fresh fruitswith rinds, such as melons or cantaloupe. Platelets are blood components responsible for blood clotting. If your platelet count falls with chemotherapy, you may bruise or bleed more easily. Let your health care provider know if this is occurring. Timetables for chemotherapy treatment are guidelines. Individual schedules will vary, depending on how each person's body tolerates the treatments. The durations of chemotherapy or radiation may be prolonged for some women or not for others. Understanding that this might occur, and allowing for flexibility in scheduling if it occurs, will make the process easier.Hormonal (Anti-Estrogen) Therapy Breast cancers are tested for whether they have r eceptors for the hormones estrogen and progesterone. If the cancer does have that receptor (results noted on the pathology report), a woman will have a r ecommendation to take some form of anti-estrogen treatment - either alone or in addition to chemotherap y . Tamoxifen was the first anti-estrogen drug used in this setting and is still the main drug used for anti-estrogen treatment in premenopausal women. Aromatase inhibitors are now most often used in place of or sequentially with T amoxifen in post- meno pausal patients. Most of these drugs are given orally and are tolerated with few major side effects. The duration of therapy is generally between 5 and 10 years and is determined by the patient and her physician. Occasionall y, younge r, premenopausal women receive a recommendation to take a monthly injection of something called an LHRH agonis t, which makes them postmenopausal and may be more effective than an anti-estrogen alone in preventing their cancer from recurring. Biologic Therapy Agents are used to attack specific targets critical to cancer growth and spread. Two agents cu rrently used in the adjuvant setting are drugs c alled trastuzumab or Herceptin\u00ae and pertuzumab or Perjeta\u00ae. If your tumor cells a re HER2-positive (results noted on the pathology report), these drugs will be important to c onsider. These are intravenous drugs, generally given w ith chemotherapy, then continued alone for a year. T he development of new therapies is another indication of the progress being made in treating breast cancer early to prevent recurrence. 05c.02PERSONALIZED TREATMENT: SYSTEMIC THERAPY < BACK TO CONTENTSComplementary and Integrative Medicine Information adapted from: http:/ /www.breastcancer.org/treatment/comp_med Complementary medicine aims to bring the whole person into harmony - physically, mentally, and emotionally - while conventional medicine does its work. For many people diagnosed with breast cancer, complementary medicine helps to relieve symptoms, ease treatment side effects, and improve quality of life. Complementary therapies are added to or used to \"complement\" conventional medicine. Complementary medicine can be combined or integrated with conventional medical treatment, and is thus also called \"integrative medicine.\" Comple-mentary medicine includes a variety of therapeutic techniques that are not part of conventional or regular medicine. What Is Complementary Medicine? Complementary medicine is not alternative medicine. Complementary medicine is used with conventional medicine. Alternative medicine is used instead of conventional medicine. Adding yoga, tai chi, or massage to your regular treatment plan may help you. But you should never replace any part of your regular treatment (surger y, che motherap y, radiation, hormonal treatment) with something else. Therefore, Breastcance r.org does not recommend alternative medicine. Conventional medicine has been proven to be safe and effective by numerous scientific studies. Complementary medicine includes techniques such as acupuncture, herbal medicine, massage, support groups, and yoga. Sometimes called holistic medicine, complementary medicine typically addresses how disease affects the whole person: physicall y, emotion ally, spiritually, and 05d.01PERSONALIZED TREATMENT: COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE < BACK TO CONTENTSsocially. Cancer patients and su rvivors often use complementary medicine. For examp le, studies have found that up to 80% of breast cancer survivors have u sed at least on e complementary technique. To he lp doctors an d patients unde rstand which complementary therapies are safe and effective for people diagnose d with breast can cer, the Society for Integrative Oncology released guidelines that make recommend ations about more than 80 complementary therapies. Meditation, yoga, and relaxation with imagery are recommended for routine use fo r common conditions, including anxiety and moo d disorders (Grade A). Stress management, yog a, massage, music therapy, energy conservation, and meditat ion are recommended for stress reductio n, anxiety, depression, fatigue, and quality o f life (Grade B) .Types of Complementary Techn iques Explo re a wide range of complementary therapy techniques \u2014 from acupuncture and yoga to praye r, music therapy, and massage at this site: http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/ comp_med/types Once you decide that you're read y to try a complementary th erapy, the ne xt step is to cho ose your practitioner with care. Some, such as acupuncturists or massage therapists, may n eed to be lice nsed to practice. T his means that the p ractitioner follows approved treatment standard s and has pass ed a test on the therapy. Others \u2014 tai chi, meditation, and hypnosis instructors \u2014 are not licensed. It's important to interview a practitioner and make sure you're comfortable wit h his or her t raining, experience, and approach to the therapy before yo u begin treatment. It's also important to find a pract itioner with experience working with p eople affected by breast cancer. Your doctor may be your best so urce for finding a reputable practit ioner. 05d.02PERSONALIZED TREATMENT: COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE < BACK TO CONTENTSTalking to Your Doctor About Complementary Medicine About two-thirds of all people who use complementary medicine have not talked about these treatments with their cancer doctors. This could be for a number of reasons. Because medical schools didn't offer classes on complementary therapies until relatively recently, you may think that your doctor doesn't know anything about complementary medicine. Or maybe because some complementary therapies seem more spiritual than medicinal, you may think your doctor doesn't need to know about them. If you would like to try complementary therapies, it's important to talk to your primary doctor about it. Your doctor wants to make sure you get the quality care you deserve. Coordination between all the doctors and practitioners you see helps to make sure you get the best care possible.How to Talk to Your Doctor Researchers say (and a Breastcancer.org survey confirmed) that many people don't want to tell their cancer doctors that they are using complementary therapies. Here are some reasons many people say they can't discuss their use of complementary medicine: There' s not enough time during the doctor's visit. The doctor might not tak e them seriously. The doctor might disappr ove. The doctor doesn't ask about these tr eatments, so why should they volunteer any information? Their doctor did not s tudy this type of medicine in school. They f eel they don't know enough to have an in-depth discussion about the therapies. If you feel that these concerns could keep you from discussing complementary medicine with your doctor, there are things you can do: Ask for more time. You can alert the nurse or doctor in advance that you'll need a little more time in the ap pointment to talk ab out these issue s. Be specific. Th e more specific you can be abou t the kind of comp lementary therapy you're interested in, the easier it will be for your do ctor to offer help. For e xample, if you 're interested in acupuncture, make a list of the symptoms you think it will h elp. Your doct or will be bette r able to help you figure out if acupunct ure would be safe for you and how it can be inte grated into your conventional the rapies. If your doctor is not familiar with complementary medi cine, direct him or her to books, websites, or research on the techniques you want to try. If patients are interested in a treatment, most doctors want to learn about it so they can provide help and advice. If you can direct your doctor to informatio n sources he or she respects, you'll most likely have a productive discussion about compleme ntary therapies. How much your docto r knows about comple mentary medicine may depend on where he or she practices medicine. If you're being treated at an 05d.03PERSONALIZED TREATMENT: COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE < BACK TO CONTENTSacademic medical center, the cancer doctors there probably have worked with a number of specialists. There may even be a complementary therapy center within the hospital. Your doctor might have colleagues in psychology who offer meditation or colleagues who are pain specialists and do acupuncture. If your doct or practices at a small hospital that's not connected to a medical school, he or she may not have had the chance to interact with comple-mentary therapy practitioners. But that doesn't mean that he or she doesn't know anything about complementary therapies. Learn about the t echnique you want to try so you can start the conversation. The Resource Guidein this section will give you the background thatyou need to bring up the subject with your doctor. Preparing for Your Discussion Once you've made the decision to talk to your doctor about complementary medicine, you can use the talking guide below. This list can help you prepare for the discussion and make an outline of topics to bring up. 1. Do a little home work. Download information on the therapies that interest you from reputable websites, such as Breastcancer.org, the NationalCenter for Complementary and AlternativeMedicine (NCCAM), and cancer center sites, suchas those listed in our Finding a ComplementaryMedicine Practitioner section. Write down yourquestions. Bring the information and questions withyou to your appointment. When your doctor asksif you have any questions, choose the top 3 thingsyou want to discuss in your appointment \u2014and make complementary medicine one of those3 things. 2. Expres s your point of view. Tell your doctor that you have started to read about complementarytherapies or you want to try them. Make it clearthat you feel complementary medicine is animportant way to help your physical and emotionalsymptoms, as well as your quality of life. Makestatements with \"I\" in them, such as \"I have reada lot about acupuncture and breast cancer, and Ifeel it may be helpful in my treatment.\"3. List en to your doctor's response. Give your doctor enough time to respond to your statements. Aftershe or he has spoken, make sure you understandthe doctor's point of view. 4. Talk t o the nurse about complementary therapies. Nurses may have had more training incomplementary medicine. The nurse also can goover the points you have already brought up withthe doctor. 5. Ask your doct or if your complementary medicine practitioner can call to discuss your combinedcare. Your doctor may be concerned that yourcomplementary medicine practitioner has notworked with people who have been diagnosedwith breast cancer. Or your doctor may have aquestion about the practitioner's credentials.A conversation between the two can help ensureyou get the quality care you deserve. 6. Res tate your commitment to conventional cancer treatment. It's important for your doctor toknow that you are committed to continuing yourchemotherapy, radiation treatments, or hormonaltherapy. Complementary BACK TO CONTENTSInfertility and Breast Cancer While breast cancer itself does not appear to affect fertility in women, cancer treatments pose a variety of reproductive risks, including infertility and premature menopause. Menopause after chemotherapy can be temporary, lasting weeks to many months, or can be permanent. Factors determining which if either occur include the type of drugs used and their dosage, the patient's age and pre-treatment fertility (which is often unknown). If menopause occurs, that means that a woman is no longer able to get pregnant. It also means that body changes will begin to occur in the absence of estrogen produced in the ovaries. These changes may include hot flashes, mood swings, weight gain, hair thinning, muscle and bone discomfort as well as bone loss. These menopausal changes will be discussed in another section. In this section we will focus on ways to reduce infertility and promote successful pregnancies.Reproductive Options Most importantly, as best we can tell, pregnancy after cancer does not cause the cancer to recur. Around 70 percent of breast cancers are estrogen receptor positive, and may grow in response to the hormone estrogen. Part of therapy for these cancers is anti-estrogen treatment, which is generally given for 5-10 years. In order to adequately treat patients, there may be a recommendation to delay pregnancy. What are the options to preserve fertility or allow for successful pregnancy? Recent studies utilizing a medication called an LHRH agonist during chemotherapy, a monthly injection, may help preserve ovarian function and fertility. While on this medicine the body is fooled that it is in menopause and ovulation does not occur. This protects some of the eggs in the ovaries and has been shown to be effective in preserving fertility in some women. You may feel like you are in menopause while on these medicines, with mood swings and hot flashes. In addition, some measures known as in vitro fertilization can be utilized to maintain the highest chance of fertility. To fully understand your choices we recommend two things: 1. Explore the websit e http:/ /www.myoncofertility.org - look under \"Patients\" and learn about fertility concerns and options. This is a complete resource in Spanish as well as English. 2. Ask your breas t care provider (nurse navigator, oncologist, or surgeon) for a referral to a repro-ductive endocrinologist (fertility expert). Theseappointments can be expedited and can occurwithin 24-48 hours. 05e.01PERSONALIZED TREATMENT: FERTILITY < BACK TO CONTENTSAfter you have b een diagnosed with breast cancer, your health care t eam will reco mmend the course of treatment that is best for yo u. Treatment can involve surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therap y, oral medicatio n or a combination thereof. These life-saving tre atments can als o produce unple asant side effects such as nausea, vomiting, constipatio n, diarrhea, taste alterations, and mouth sores. In this section, we sugge st ways to take good care of yourself on this journey, including advice on he althy eating and ways t o address side e ffects, so that you can feel your b est before, during and after treatment. Eating Well Making healthy food choices is one of the best things you can do to take care of yourself at this time. Even though many cancer treatments may reduce your appetite, calories and nutrients are essential to keeping up your strength and helping your body re cover from cancer. And making appropriate food choices can actually alleviate some of the side effects of treatment. So, while you may n ot feel hungr y, you still need to eat. Think of food the way you think of medicine - as something you take b ecause it makes you bette r. Balancing Calories Weight gain is commonly seen when being treated for breast can cer as a result of hormonal therap ies or early menopause . However, some of the side effects of chemo therapies can also cause loss of appetite and co nsequently weig ht. It is important to balance the type of calories you consume and choose from healthy sources. Carbohydrate- containing foods such as fruit s, vegetables, and whole grains are good sources of fiber, and pro vide us with energy. Proteins, such as meat, fish, poultry, nuts, n ut butters, and legumes are the building blocks of our bodies and help us heal. Healthy fats, su ch as those from vegetable sou rces like oils and n ut butters help u s to absorb certain vitamins and aid in keep our bo dies in good working order. 06.01NUTRITION Feeling Your Best < BACK TO CONTENTSHere are some suggestions for getting enough to eat, even when your appetite is reduced because of treatment: Eat five t o six small meals throughout the day, roughly every two to four hours, even if you don't feel particularly hungry. Bring healthy snacks where ver you go. Nuts, dried fruits, crackers with peanut butter or cheese, agranola bar, yogurt, hard-boiled eggs, or a bananawith peanut butter are good portable snacks.Supplements such as Ensure\u00ae Complete or Boost\u00aePlus are healthy meal replacements when thethought of eating or preparing a meal is notfeasible. If trying to maintain or gain weight, a void filling, low-calorie foods such as popcorn, lettuce andbroth. Choose nutrient-rich bever ages such as milk, Boost\u00ae Plus, Ensure\u00ae Complete, or 100 percentfruit juice instead of sodas. Sip non-caffeinat ed fluids throughout the day. A general goal would be approximately two litersper day or about 8 cups unless you have been toldby your doctor to restrict fluids. This is particularlyimportant if it is a chemo day or if you areexperiencing vomiting or diarrhea. - Pay attention to portion sizes if you are watching your weight. Check food labels andpackage serving sizes. The Importance of Protein When the body is stressed by bot h cancer and cancer treatmen ts, it requires more protein t han usual to rebuild . On average, t ry to take in 70 to 90 grams of protein every day. Three ounces of me at, poultry or fish provide appro ximately 21 grams of protein. If you don't feel like preparing a meal, having high pro tein \"grab and go\" items on hand will help you to reach this goal. These could include hard-boiled eggs, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, cheese sticks, and lean cold cut s such as sliced turkey.Healthy Carbohydrates Eating enough fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help you keep up your energy - most of our vitamins and minerals are found in this group. They also promote healthy bowel habits. This is especially important during chemotherapy, which can cause either diarrhea or constipation, depending on the drug. On average, a person should consume 25-35 grams of fiber per day. Another bonus is that fiber can help us feel fuller longer if weight maintenance or loss is desired. Fats There are two kinds of fat - saturated and unsaturated. Saturated fats come from animals (butter, cheese) and are known to increase risk of heart disease and high cholesterol. Unsaturated fats come from vegetables (olive and other vegetable oils, avocados, nuts) and have been shown to protect your heart and cholesterol. They have equal calories per tablespoon, so if trying to gain weight, focus on the unsaturated fats. If trying to lose weight, eliminating excessive fat from any source is a good thing. 06.02NUTRITION < BACK TO CONTENTS06.03NUTRITION primary fuel for every cell in our body. The brain uses glucose almost exclusively for energy. So eliminating fruits, vegetables, and whole grains would not be practical if we want to maintain a healthy diet. However, avoiding foods with simple sugars such as sweets, candy, cakes, etc., is a healthy choice for all of us. As with any choice, you may feel more comfortable avoiding soy and flaxseed during treatment. If you would like more information, please speak with your registered dietitian or oncologist. A Word about Water Everyone needs sufficient water to stay healthy, but for people being treated for cancer, drinking enough water is especially important. The vomiting or diarrhea that may occur as a side effect of treatment can rob the body of fluid and cause dehydration. Take care to replace these fluids by drinking adequate amounts of fluids like water or other clear liquids. Avoid tea, coffee, colas and other beverages containing caffeine, since these draw fluid out of the body. The American Cancer Society recommends drinking eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day.Foods in Question Soy products such as tofu and edamame have been shown to be safe to consume even in people with ER-positive breast cancers. However, soy protein isolates, a concentrated form of soy, that have been concentrated into supplements should be avoided. While a serving of tofu or edamame is acceptable, you should not consume soy protein in this highly concentrated form. http:/ /www.cancer.org/cancer/news/expertvoices/ post/2012/08/02/the-bottom-line-on-soy-and-breast-cancer-risk.aspx Ground flaxseed has properties similar to soy. Current research is showing that two to three tablespoons of ground flax is an acceptable addition to a healthy diet, even in women with ER-positive breast cancers. https:/ /www.oncologynutrition.org/erfc/hot-topics/ flaxseeds-and-breast-cancer/ Many people are concerned about sugar causing cancer. All carbohydrate-containing foods break down to sugar (or glucose). Glucose is the < BACK TO CONTENTSWeight Control During treatment for breast cancer is not a good time to try to lose weight. As mentioned before, you do need sufficient calories during this time. However, once your treatment is finished, getting to a healthy weight as soon as possible is very important. Excess weight has been associated with heightened hormone levels, which may play a role in tumor development in some people. Plus, you'll feel better physically and emotionally when you achieve a weight that's right for you. Take care to avoid fast food, \"junk\" food, sweets and other high-calorie, low-nutrient foods. Watch your portion size, and, with your doctor's approval, increase your level of physical activity. Treatment Side Effects The side effects associated with chemotherapy, radiation, and even surgery can be difficult to manage. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, mouth sores, etc., all can prevent you from eating and obtaining enough energy to help you heal and, ultimately, feel better. It is important to ask to speak with the registered dietitian who can give you helpful tips to lessen these potential side effects.As you go through your breast cancer journe y, the nutritio n recommendations may change. Ultimately the goal is to keep you h ealth y, minimize side effects, and send you on your survivorship journey with the tools to maintain a healthy weight and lifestyle. More Nutrition Information Our registered die titian can give yo u more information about nutrition during and after treatment for breast cance r. You can also find useful information about nutrition and managing side effects on th e website of UConn Health's Carole and Ray www.aicr.org (American Institute for Cancer Research) www.oncologynutrition.org (Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics' Oncology Practice Group) www.cancer.org (American Cancer Society) Benefits of Exerci se Research increasingly suggests that exercise is of great benefit to people during and after cancer treatment. No, you don't have to train for the Olympics! Whatever exercise you can comfortably do - with your doctor's advice, of course - is believed to be beneficial. The American Cancer Society now holds that exercise is not only safe and possible during cancer treatment, but can improve both physical funct ioning and quality of life.

Clinical trials are research studies in which real people participate as volunteers. Clinical research studies (also known as clinical trials) are designed to evaluate health risks and to test new approaches to the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of specific diseases or disorders. These studies play a significant role in the development of new treatments and medications for diseases and conditions. The goal of research is to find better ways to treat or identify cancer and help cancer patients. Clinical trials test many types of treatment, such as new drugs, new approaches to surgery or radiation therapy, new combinations of treatments, or new methods such as gene therapy. Some clinical trials study the effects of our standard treatments on patient quality of life during and after completion of the treatment. The knowledge that may be gained from this type of work can be of great value to our society. To ensure the safety of volunteers who enroll in clinical studies, each project must be approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) before it can begin. During the review process, the IRB evaluates the potential risks and benefits associated with the study and decides whether or not to approve it. Should I Participate in a Clinical Trial? This is a question only you, those close to you, and your healthcare providers can answer together. Learning you have breast cancer, and deciding what to do about it, is often overwhelming. Clinical trials are the safest and most effective way to study cancer prevention, improve breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, and address the needs of breast cancer survivors. Each trial has a specific set of criteria that determines who is eligible to participate. Individuals who choose to participate in clinical research studies may do so in hopes of improving their own health or advancing scientific knowledge about the cause, treatment and prevention of disease. The health of millions has been improved because of advances in science and technology, and the willingness of thousands of individuals like you to take part in clinical research. 07.01CLINICAL TRIALS < BACK TO CONTENTSAm I Eligible for a Clinical Trial? Your eligibility may be determined by various factors, depending on the nature of the study. If you meet the screening conditions, you will be given an \"Informed Consent Form\" containing a detailed written description of the project, any risks involved, and your rights as a participant. If the screening process involves any type of intervention, such as obtaining a blood sample or documenting personal health information, the consent process will be conducted prior to the screening to ensure that you are informed of what will be required of you and of any potential risks to your well-being. By signing and returning the consent form you agree to participate. If you should have second thoughts about participating, or become uncomfortable during the study, you have the right to withdraw at any time without any penalty whatsoever. Benefits of Participating in a Clinical Trial Participating in clinical research may have a significant impact on your life. Some people may benefit directly from participating in a study, for example, if a drug being used in the study proves to be effective. Some people may not benefit directly, but their participation may help to advance knowledge that could benefit others in the future. It is important that you are well-informed and feel confident about your decision. If you have breast cancer, we encourage you to join a clinical trial. Clinical trials offer the chance to try new treatments and possibly benefit from them. Learning a new therapy is better than the standard treatments can open doors to other drugs and procedures that may be even more effective. Some people worry they will get a placebo instead of an effective treatment in a clinical trial. Your health care provider or the clinical research staff can tell you if there is a placebo in the study. Most 07.02CLINICAL TRIALS < BACK TO CONTENTSoften in a breast cancer treatment clinical trial, you will get either the new treatment or the standard treatment. So, even if you do not get the new drug (or other new therapy), your breast cancer will be treated just as it would if you were not in the trial. You may want to consult with your doctor, family members and the research staff of the project to discuss any concerns you may have. Is it Safe to Participate in a Clinical Trial? Clinical research studies conducted at UConn Health are approved according to federal, state and UConn Health guidelines. In fact, no study can even begin before it has been approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB), which carefully considers the potential risks and benefits of the study before authorizing it. The safety and protection of research subjects participating in these studies are of paramount concern. If you are interested in participating in a clinical trial, you will be given an informed consent form that spells out the nature of the study and any risks that are involved and clarifies your rights as a participant. If any kind of intervention is involved in the trial, such as obtaining blood samples or documenting the participant's health history, a careful consent process is conducted before the person actually becomes involved in the study. This ensures that the research participant knows what is expected and any potential risks. Completing and returning the consent form means the person agrees to volunteer. But if the volunteer then has second thoughts, she/he can simply withdraw from the study anytime. Additionally, UConn Health has a research subject advocate (RSA), whose job is to represent the interests of the volunteers who participate in our studies. The RSA has a number of responsibilities. She/he must provide information to patients and volunteers who are participating in any clinical trial and research where there is a greater than minimal risk. Other responsibilities of the RSA include: Assis ting investigators to develop data and safety monitoring plans, and helping research advisory committees review those plans; Assuring tha t the Health Center's studies adhere to the IRB-approved protocol and monitoringprocedures; Ensuring the reporting of an y significant problems or conflicts of interest to appropriatelocal committees and federal agencies; and Assuring tha t UConn Health investigators are appropriately trained and remain current on theirregulatory and patient safety responsibilities. Who Conducts a Clinical Trial? Each study conducted at UConn Health has a principal investigator (PI) who is the person in charge of the research study. The PI may be one of a number of different kinds of healthcare professionals. He or she will assemble a team of research professionals who will also be involved in managing the study. The majority of the breast oncology research studies are conducted through the Clinical Trials Office (CTO), well-qualified research professionals who successfully help conduct clinical trials at UConn Health. 07.03CLINICAL TRIALS < BACK TO CONTENTSSome Important Questions to Ask About Clinical Trials If you are considering participating in a clinical trial, you probably have a lot of questions. Even if you are eligible to participate in a study, you should give it careful thought before deciding to become a participant. While you may benefit in a host of ways from participation, you should also be aware that par-ticipating could impact your life in many ways, as well. It is important for you to make an informed decision. So, you will probably want to consult with your personal physician and members of your family before making a commitment. If you have any concerns about the project, you should also discuss them with the research team working on the research study. Here are some questions you'll want to obtain answers to before making a decision: Wha t is the purpose of the study? How man y people will take part in the study?Wha t kinds of tests will be required as part of the study and how often will the tests be done? Are ther e any risks? How likely are they to occur and what will be done to reduce the likelihood of their occurring? Am I likely t o benefit directly from participating in the study? Wha t are the study's potential benefits to other people and to society as a whole? Wha t potential advantages does the experimental treatment offer over the current standard of care? How long will m y participation in the study be required? Wha t discomforts, inconveniences or costs will I experience as a participant? If I choose not to tak e part in the study, what other options do I have at this time for treatment? Can I withdra w from the study if I experience negative side effects? Will this tr eatment be covered by insurance? If my insurance does not pay for the treatment, who isresponsible for the costs? Will an y of the treatments be free? Is there an y follow-up care after I leave the study? If so, for how long? What are your Rights as a Participant? Signing a consent form and joining a study does not obligate you to remain in a study. In fact, you can leave at any time if you decide, for any reason, that the study is not right for you. One of your key rights is the right to informed consent. This means that you must be given all the facts about the study before you decide whether to take part.All volunteers who participate in studies at UConn Health are guaranteed rights that ensure they are treated professionally and respectfully. When you take part in one of our studies you have the right to: Be trea ted with respect. Know the risks of participa tion in the study. Know wha t alternatives are available. Withdr aw from the study without penalty. 07.04CLINICAL TRIALS < BACK TO CONTENTSMake your decision without feeling any pressure fr om the research staff. Know the name , credentials and contact information of the study's principal investigator. Know the purpose of the s tudy. Know who will ha ve access to your information. Know wha t procedures may be performed and what drugs or medicines may be used. Seek additional help or clarification during theinf ormed consent process and at any time during the study. What are your Responsibilities as a Participant? All volunteers who participate in studies at UConn Health are expected to comply with the specific requirements of the study. In addition, study participants are expected to adhere to a general set of requirements that apply to all participants. They include: Arriving for all scheduled appointments or calling ahead if y ou are unable to keep an appointment. Arranging y our own transportation to and from the study site(s). Follo wing the directions of the researchers. Making sure y our contact information is up to date. Pro viding - to the best of your ability - accurate information about your medical history if it isrelevant to the study. Seeking healthcare f or any medical conditions unrelated to the study. Asking the resear chers to completely answer any questions you may have at any time during the study. Informing the r esearch staff of any negative expe- riences you have while participating in the study. Informing the r esearch subject advocate and, if necessary, the Institutional Review Board if you feelyour rights as a study subject have been violated.Types of Clinical Trials There are four kinds of clinical trials: In trea tment trials a new treatment (such as a new cancer drug or a new approach to surgery or radiation therapy) is studied. In pre vention trials the study tests new approaches (such as medicines, vitamins or some other formof dietary supplements) that may lower individuals'risk of cancer. Prevention trials may target peoplewho have never had cancer or focus on preventinga recurrence in people who have had cancer. Screening trials f ocus on ways to detect cancer, especially in the early stages, when it is mosttreatable. And quality of life trials s tudy how best to improve the care and comfort of cancer patients. 07.05CLINICAL TRIALS < BACK TO CONTENTSIf a clinical trial is testing a new drug, it will almost certainly progress along a series of phases: In Phase I trials, researchers evalua te how new drugs should be administered, how often they should be administered, and what dosage is safe. Phase II trials extend the research c onducted in Phase I and begin to study how well the new drug actually works. Usually, the focus in Phase II is on aspecific type of cancer. Phase III trials test a new drug or a combina tion of drugs or, sometimes, a new surgical procedureby comparing those new therapies to currentstandards. Phase III trials almost always involvelarge numbers of participants and many differenthealthcare facilities. Phase IV trials are used to further evalua te the long-term safety and effectiveness of a treatment.These refining trials may take place after a newtreatment has been approved for standard care. What do Clinical Trials Mean for Breast Cancer Patients and Survivors? For breast cancer patients, participating in a clinical trial could mean studying or comparing many different things, including new drugs; current drugs; new surgical methods; the use of new equipment or devices; better ways to manage side effects; support groups; complementary therapies; and innovative approaches to reducing the likelihood of contracting cancer or experiencing a recurrence. Clinical trials offer breast cancer patients and survi- vors a number of opportunities, including: Benefiting from new treatments not y et available to patients in general, Contributing to an understanding of what w orks for people who have breast cancer and what may help others with breast cancer in the future, and The possibility that a treatment may help one feelbetter while living with breast cancer.Can you Learn the Results of a Study? Many study participants wish to review the results of studies in which they have participated. Once a study is complete, participants are informed of their results and given advice concerning their future medical care. You should be aware that this may not occu r for some time after a study is complete, while all research data are being analyzed. Where can I find Additional Information on Clinical Trials? You can find additional information by visiting the UConn Health clinical trials resource website available at https://health.uconn.edu/research.

You've traveled a long road since hearing the words, \"it's breast cancer.\" You are now entering into a new aspect of breast cancer care called Survivorship. You may feel strong, proud, relieved, and grateful, like a new person, and that it's time to celebrate - or you may feel anxious about treatment ending, fearful of the unknown, alone, or traumatized without the safety net of your frequent visits to your oncology team. For the majority of you, the side effects from treatment may be minimal if any at all; you will return to your everyday routine and continue with a good quality of life. Some of you will still be experiencing the effects of treatment physically (with fatigue, neuropathy, chemo brain, hot flashes); emotionally (with anxiety, depression, worry, and questions about sexuality and appearance); spiritually (finally asking, why me, what did I do wrong?); and financially (who's going to pay all the medical bills?). Remember this: you matter to us. 08.01SURVIVORSHIP PLANNING Living Beyond a Breast Diagnosis and Treatment into Survivorship < BACK TO CONTENTSNow that your active treatment has ended, your quality of life and long-term survivorship are just as important as t he day you were told of your diagnosis. We took you under our wings then: we will not abandon you now. Our goal is to move you beyond curative treatment to what you consider a good quality of life, a new normal. You may wonder and worry about how and when you will be followed by your breast cancer te am for your history of breast cancer. You may ask yourself, are the appointments random? Will th ey remember me if I am not there as often? Who do I call if I have a question, or beg in to panic because I have a headache and cough? The Breast Team follows best practice guidelines that specifically outline the timeline for follo w-up care visits and active surveillance. These guidelines are individualized to specifically meet your breast cancer diagnosis and treatment . These visits include a review of your history, physical exam and mammogram or MRI if you still h ave breast tissue after your original breast cancer surgery. You will be asked about how you are fe eling and of any concerns you may have since your last visit to yo ur team. You will have an opportunity to follow u p with a visit to a genetic counse lor, social worker, physical therap ist, dietician, chaplin, or to discuss an issue with the breast nurse n avigator. It is still very important that you continue with regular GYN exams, especially if you are taking Tamoxifen. In addition, your bone health will be a central part of your surveillance if your treatment can have an impact on it. As part of our commitment to in dividualized breast cancer care, we have st arted a Survivorship Program. About 3-6 months after your surgery, chemotherapy or radiation treatme nt has been completed (but wh ile you may still be on anti-estrogen the rapy), you will h ave a Survivorship Visit with an AP RN or RN. They will review in detail your b reast cancer histo ry and treatmen t as well as you r team of health care providers . They will review with you any distress ing or botherso me symptoms that yo u are continuing to experience; when to call yo ur breast team or primary care provider; possible long-term side effects you may experience; and assist you in acce ssing rehabilitation se rvices you may need to help youfeel your best. Breast cancer survivors who ha ve attended survivorship visits have told us the information on their diagnosis, treatment and follow-up plan was invaluable to them and their families. You will be provided with a written survivorship treatment summary for your own personal records. A copy will be placed in your cancer center medical record, and provided to your primary care provider or any other healthcare provider you identify to receive a copy. Our goal is to prevent gaps in communication and improve coordination of your care between members of your care team.

Up to 2/3 of all breast cancer survivors will report some type of sexual dysfunction, ranging from painful intercourse to a lack of interest or desire. Unfortunately, surveys have shown that very few women will feel comfortable talking to their provider about these issues because they may feel embarrassed or they worry their provider does not think it is a priority. Your sexual health may be a very important part of your life: if you are having issues, they may impact your relationships at home and overall sense of well-being. The first step is to know that these issues are important and your doctors do want to listen and help. There are many resources available to you, and your breast cancer team should include a gynecologist, with whom you schedule an annual visit and pelvic exam. Many breast cancer treatments impact hormone levels through chemotherapy, surgical removal of the ovaries, or medications like Lupron that shut down the ovaries. Also, some of the medications you take following treatment for 5 or 10 years (aromatase inhibitors, Tamoxifen) can also impact the vagina and uterus. A lack of estrogen can lead to hot flashes, night sweats, decreased sexual drive and thinning and drying of vaginal tissue. Most women with breast cancer are not able to be on estrogen replacement therapy to treat these symptoms: it is important to discuss your options with your breast team. 09a.01STAYING HEALTHY & LIVING LONGER: SEXUALITY Your sexual health is important! < BACK TO CONTENTSVaginal Dryness (Atrophy) and Pain with Intercourse The first step is to have a pelvic exam and assess- ment. Atrophy is a very common cause of painful intercourse: depending on how severe the dryness is, there are a range of options. (See attached sheet on vaginal dryness.) Start with lubricants and daily moisturizers; in some cases a vaginal estrogen pill or cream can be used for a short time to rebuild the tissue. Sometimes the vagina can begin to stick together from dryness and using vaginal dilators can help stretch the tissue out over time. Sometimes after breast surgery and radiation women can have chronic breast pain. This can impact their sexual health and even lead to pain with intercourse as well. There are specialists in physical therapy who can help you learn techniques and exercises that may help. Women who have experienced pain with intercourse following breast cancer treatment may be more apprehensive and fearful about future attempts. Sexual health counselors are a great resource to talk with about these fears and give you strategies on how to overcome them. Decreased Interest and Desire Your libido will be impacted by a lack of estrogen and some medications. Many antidepressants can also decrease your sex drive. There are currently no approved medications for women that are comparable to 'Viagra' for men, but there are several options being studied currently. It is important to talk to a sexual health counselor and your provider. Depression and anxiety are very common for anyone dealing with cancer and can also impact your overall mood and ability to find pleasure.

Therapies to treat breast cancer may have significant impact on bone health, with potential for bone loss and fractures. Therefore, it is important for all women undergoing cancer therapies to understand the implications of their treatment. Chemotherapy may have a direct negative impact on bone metabolism leading to lowering of bone mass in women receiving this treatment. Moreover, in younger premenopausal women, chemotherapy may lead to loss of regular menstrual periods, a major risk factor for bone loss that occurs early in the course of therapy. Therefore, it is critical that women in this category receive adequate counseling about prevention strategies, and consider treatment with medications to slow down or inhibit this bone loss in order to maintain good bone health and prevent future fractures. Aromatase inhibitors are medications used in the treatment of postmenopausal hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. The major effect of these agents is to lower estrogen levels to almost undetectable values. In doing so, they may compromise bone health in women who are already potentially at higher risk of bone loss due to the menopausal state. A number of large studies in trials in the medical literature demonstrate this finding very clearly. Therefore, it is extremely important that women are educated in prevention as well as treatment options to avoid bone loss which can ultimately lead to fractures that can have a major impact on quality of life. All women undergoing aromatase inhibitor therapy should have a Bone Mineral Density exam done by DXA technology prior to or upon starting this therapy to assess their risk for fracture. This should be done in a radiology unit that does these examinations routinely, and also has measures in place to assure the high quality of each examination. Prevention strategies include knowledge of adequate amounts of calcium from food sources as well as supplements, adequate intake of vitamin D, and an understanding of weight-bearing as well as resistance-training activities and exercise. All of these are important for the foundation of any bone health program. Furthermore, medications that can inhibit or slow down the bone breakdown that can occur due to chemotherapy or aromatase inhibitor treatment in women already menopausal, are important to consider. To fully understand prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in general: 1. Explore the w ebsite; http:/ /www.nof.org and look under \"patient information\" to learn more about nutrition, exercise and treatment. It is a completeresource guide. 2. Ask your br east care provider (nurse navigator, oncologist, or surgeon) for a referral to a boneendocrinologist who is experienced in the careand follow-up of breast cancer patients. 09b.01STAYING HEALTHY & LIVING LONGER: BONE HEALTH < BACK TO CONTENTSDealing with Fatigue Fatigue is one of the most common side effects of cancer treatment. In fact, experts say that nearly 90 percent of people receiving chemotherapy and radiation experience fatigue. It can be a serious problem. Debilitating fatigue can cause people to quit their jobs, withdraw from social activities and experience a diminished quality of life. Fatigue among people in treatment for cancer is so common and troublesome that the Neag Comprehensive Cancer Center at UConn Health has established a cancer fatigue clinic to provide treatment and support to patients with cancer-related fatigue and to conduct research on the subject. Tell Your Doctor: Help Is Available About half of people with cancer-related fatigue also have significant anxiety and depression. The most important thing for patients to do is to tell their oncologists about these problems. Some people have underlying medical problems that contribute to fatigue. These may include thyroid problems or electrolyte imbalances. Your doctor can evaluate you for these and other underlying problems and correct them with medication. Depression, anxiety, pain and insomnia all contribute to fatigue. Your doctor can also prescribe medication and/or counseling to help alleviate these symptoms. Many people are helped significantly by a therapeutic technique called cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Your doctor or nurse can help you find a therapist skilled in CBT. The cancer fatigue clinic at UConn Health's Neag Comprehensive Cancer Center is an excellent resource you and your doctor can turn to for help with fatigue, depression, anxiety and insomnia.Practice Good Habits Practicing good \"sleep hygiene\" may also help. Go to bed at the same time each evening, and get up at the same time each day. Avoid alcohol, caffeine or other substances that might disturb your sleep. Make sure your bedroom is dark and that the temperature is comfortable. Reduce Your Stress When you're in treatment, it simply may not be possible to maintain the pace of life you had before diagnosis. It's often difficult for women who've always been active and who may be juggling work and family demands to accept the fact that they may have to do a little less for a while. But trying to \"do it all\" while in treatment is likely to increase the stress you feel, and stress only adds to fatigue. So take some time to set priorities and to let some things go. Don't be afraid to ask others to do a little more. Accept offers of help from family and friends. You'll feel less burdened, and they'll feel good about having a tangible way to show that they care about you. 09c.01STAYING HEALTHY & LIVING LONGER: STRESS MANAGEMENT < BACK TO CONTENTS09d.01STAYING HEALTHY & LIVING LONGER: LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION Staying Active and Healthy Eating Women living with a prior breast cancer diagnosis number in the millions. The proportion of women who succumb to their cancer is decreasing with early detection and better treatments. Death from cardiovascular disease is now the number one killer. In part due to diagnosis and treatment, it is not uncommon for women to develop other medical issues called comorbidities. These include weight gain, insulin resistance, diabetes, elevated cholesterol and reduced activity. These in turn act to not only increase the incidence of death due to heart and other vascular diseases, but perhaps to increase mortality from the breast cancer as well. One thing that we can control is our ability to exercise and eat well. Below are some recommendations for regular exercise and eating healthier. Staying Active As recommended by the American Cancer Society: http:/ /www.cancer.org/healthy/eathealthygetactive Be Physically Active Adults: Get at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity activity each week (or a combination of these), preferably spread throughout the week. Limit sedentary behavior such as sitting, lying down, watching TV, and other forms of screen-based entertainment. Doing some physical activity above usual activities, no matter what one's level of activity, can have many health benefits. < BACK TO CONTENTS09d.02STAYING HEALTHY & LIVING LONGER: LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION Moderate intensity Vigorous intensity Exercise and leisure Walking, dancing, leisurely bicycling, ice and roller skating, horseback riding, canoeing, yoga Jogging or running, fast bicycling, circuit weight training, aerobic dance, martial arts, jumping rope, swimming Sports Volleyball, golfing, softball, baseball, badminton, doubles tennis, downhill skiingSoccer, field or ice hockey, lacrosse, singles tennis, racquetball, basketball, cross-country skiing Home activities Mowing the lawn, general yard and garden maintenance Digging, carrying and hauling, masonry, carpentry Workplace activity Walking and lifting as part of the job (custodial work, farming, auto or machine repair)Heavy manual labor (forestry, construction, fire fighting)Usual and intentional activities can also be grouped by intensity: Light intensity activities include activities such as house work, shopping, or gardening. Moderat e intensity activities are those that require effort equal to a brisk walk. Vigorous intensity activities generally use large muscle groups and result in a faster heart rate, deeper and faster breathing, and sweating. Examples of moderate and vigorous intensity physical activities: Tips to reduce sitting time: Limit time spent watching TV and using other forms of screen-based entertainment. Use a stationary bicycle or treadmill when you do watch TV. Use stairs rather than an elevator. If you can, walk or bike to your destination. Exercis e at lunch with your coworkers, family, or friends. Take an exercise break at work to stretch or take a quick walk. Walk to visit coworkers instead of phoning or sending an email. Go dancing with your spouse or friends. Plan active vacations rather than only driving trips. We ar a pedometer every day and increase your number of daily steps. < BACK TO CONTENTSNutrition If you are overweight or have poor eating habits, your risk of developing breast cancer is increased. Here are some simple tips to help get you on the path to a healthier life and reduce your risk. 1.Weight Loss - Being overweight or obese (Body Mass Index of 25.0 or greater), is a primary risk factor for breast cancer, particularly if you are post menopause. While following a diet high in fruits, vegetables and whole grains is not shown to directly prevent breast cancer, it can help you lose the weight and provide your body with the nutrition it needs to fight other types of cancer, diabetes and heart disease.i 2. Building a Healthy Meal Plan ii a.Fruits and Vegetables - Half of your plate should be covered with fruits and vegetables. And, the more variety and color, the greater thenutrition. A general rule of thumb for women is 1 \u00bd - 2 cups of fruit per day, which can include fresh, frozen, dried or canned fruit. If you drink juice, limit it to 4 ounces per day. Vegetable choices can include green leafy vegetables, legumes such as beans and lentils, yellow and orange squashes, starchy vegetables such as corn and potatoes, and options like cucumbers and avocados. Two to 2 \u00bd cups of cooked vegetables is a good target. One and a half cups of raw salad is considered equal to \u00bd cup of cooked vegetables. b. Grains - These help with weight loss because they contain fiber which keeps you fuller longer.Fiber also has the added benefit of improvingconstipation. One quarter of your plate shouldcontain grains such as oats, wheat, barley,rice, and corn and products made from these.Choose \"whole grains\" (check the label on 09d.03STAYING HEALTHY & LIVING LONGER: LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION Healthy Eating < BACK TO CONTENTScereals, breads, pastas, rice and cornmeal products) for at least half of your choices. These contain the most nutrients because they are made with the whole grain. \"Refined\" products do not contain whole grains and therefore are not as nutritious. New \"old\" grains such as farro and quinoa can bring added interest, texture and flavors to your meals. The recommended amount for women is 5-6 ounces per day. c.Lean Protein - This food group provides the building blocks for your body including healthy muscles. Choose mostly from fish, chicken, tofu, beans, peas, nuts, and seeds. Other sources of protein include dairy products like cottage cheese and yogurt, and meat and pork. Choose low-fat dairy and limit beef and pork consu mption due to higher saturated fat content. Recommended servings per day for wome n are 5-5.5 ounces. d.Dairy - These products are rich in calcium to help build strong bones and teeth, in addition to helping your body operate. Low-fat and no-fat milk, cheese, yogurt, and soy dairy products are good choices. If you have lactose intolerance, there are many lactose-free products to choose from - this helps you get your calcium and other benefits from dairy without intestinal discomfort. e.Fat - This is an important group that helps us absorb certain vitamins and provides us with some essential nutrients. However, we don't need a lot and should choose fat sources from vegetable oils, nuts, and nut butters for heart-healthy benefits. Fat that is solid at room temperature (saturated fat), such as butter, margarine, lard, bacon fat, etc., is bad for the heart and should be limited. Generally, three to six teasp oons a day will provide essential nutrients. Err on the lower side for weight loss. f.Water - Keeping up with your water or non-caffeinated fluid intake is as important to your body as the food you eat. If your urine is pale yellow to clear in color, you are drinking enough. Try to drink 48-60 ounces of non-caffeinated fluid per day and focus on most of that being water, if possible.3. Alcoholic Be verages - Alcohol consumption is a high risk factor for breast cancer occurrence or recurrence. It also has a lot of empty calories thatcan prevent weight loss. Alcohol should belimited. If you choose to drink, the maximum isone drink per day for women and two drinks perday for men. This means 1 ounce of hard liquor,four ounces of wine, or 12 ounces of beer. iii Please ask to see our regist ered dietitian to develop a meal plan that is tailored to yourspecific needs.
