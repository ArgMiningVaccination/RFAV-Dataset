In the absence of deterring the Covid-19 scourge therapeutically, it has been acclaimed globally that strengthening the immune system will work wonders in combating the pandemic - an all-time well tested mantra to stay safe and healthy, the Economic Times in an article noted. Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier in the month said that acceptance and popularity of Ayurveda have risen significantly in the last few months amid the coronavirus pandemic. This has also opened up opportunities for India to develop Ayurveda and integrate it with evidence-based medical science. PM Modi stressed that Ayurveda is part of a holistic Indian cultural package. \"Ayurveda is closely linked to the respect Indian culture gives to nature and the environment. It could rightly be described as a holistic human science, from the plants to your plates,\" the Prime Minister said. Ayurveda as a form of medicine towards holistic physical wellbeing is beginning to gain steady momentum. \"This is especially true in German-speaking areas of Europe, where alternative medicine is relatively popular. Here, Ayurveda is now much sought after,\" says the website of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). According to the John Hopkins Medicine portal, the concepts of universal interconnectedness, the body's constitution (prakriti), and life forces (doshas) are the primary basis of ayurvedic medicine. \"Goals of treatment aid the person by eliminating impurities, reducing symptoms, increasing resistance to disease, reducing worry, and increasing harmony in life. Herbs and other plants, including oils and common spices, are used extensively in Ayurvedic treatment,\" it said, adding that In India, Ayurveda is considered a form of medical care, equal to conventional Western medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, naturopathic medicine, and homeopathic medicine. Unsurprisingly, the Modi administration is committed to making India, the world leader in integrative medicine, drawing the country's the rich medical heritage, says V Muraleedharan, Minister of State for External Affairs & Parliamentary Affairs. Addressing the virtual valedictory session of '4th Global Ayurveda Festival Conference & Expo', organized by industry body FICCI, Muraleedharan said, \"We need to be focused in making Ayurveda play a major role in nation building also contributing to meet the developmental goals of the global community. He added that the world is gradually becoming more receptive towards Ayurveda as a medical science. \"We need to be aware of the role Ayurveda could play in meeting health care needs of the global community and we will create a roadmap to popularize Ayurveda globally by promoting Wellness Tourism as an Indian specialty,\" the minister said.
