It's a form of alternative medicine that is said to have been developed around 100 BC in China. Acupuncture aims to stimulate different points along the body to help alleviate pain as well as treat a wide range of conditions. Bio-resonance Therapy Bioresonance Therapy is a method of testing the electromagnetic waves emitted by cells. Using this process, we can better understand what the body is lacking and which supplements might best support the restoration of harmony in the body. Diagnostic Testing Often times part of your treatment will be to have some variation of testing completed. This is typically done outside of our office. Fertility Enrichment Naturopathic treatment of female infertility is focused on balancing nutritional deficiencies, correcting hormonal imbalances and improving overall reproductive health. Nutritional Counseling One of the most important aspects of good health is a balanced diet. By assessing your current diet and food patterns we can create a Nutritional Program that is easy to follow while at the same time educating you to help meet normal and therapeutic needs. Preventative Medicine Consists of taking appropriate measures to help prevent disease. Discussing what it means to be healthy and living a balanced lifestyle, both mentally and physically can help set the groundwork for living a long-lasting more fulfilled life. In addition to educating yourself, regular check-ups and testing can help keep you and your health on track. Pre and Post Natal Care Understanding the body's cycles and preparing your body for conception can improve the chances of becoming pregnant and having a healthy pregnancy. During your pregnancy, it will be important to support you and your baby with certain additional vitamins and minerals. After giving birth, Naturopathic Medicine can help support you with your energy levels, breastfeeding and overall strength. Therapeutic Body Work There are various types of bodywork, but all aim to improve posture, alleviate pain and cultivate awareness of body-mind connection. Weight Loss Programs Naturopathic Medicine approaches weight-loss from a holistic perspective. Treating the entire person, by understanding how weight is lost and not simply counting calories will help create a lifestyle change that is sustainable. We take into consideration factors such as stress, hormone balance, quality of sleep and diet history. Hydrotherapy Hydrotherapy is the use of alternating hot and cold water combined with mild electro-stimulation to exert healing effects on the body. Our clinic offers constitutional hydrotherapy in which the technician applies hot/cold towels and a gentle physiologic current to the upper body of the patient. Benefits include detoxification, immune support, digestive enhancement, increases in blood/lymph circulation, boosting blood cell count and optimizing tissue oxygenation. Hydrotherapy treats acute and chronic conditions including respiratory and digestive disorders, inflammation, frequent illness or infection, fatigue and much more. Infrared Sauna The infrared sauna is a 30 minute session that has many health benefits. Infrared is part of the sun's invisible spectrum of light that has the ability to penetrate human tissue. Infrared heat therapy uses this characteristic to directly heat the body rather than just the air surrounding it. The infrared heat penetrates the skin giving it a natural warmth. Unlike sunbathing, infrared therapy is completely healthy and safe. You can relax in the sauna knowing that it will never cause your skin to burn. The sauna will also increase the body's core temperature thus resulting in a much deeper, more detoxifying sweat from the cellular level of the skin where many toxins are stored. The sauna itself is well-ventilated and extremely comfortable. It is a special and calming atmosphere in which to relax and take care of your body. Some of the benefits of infrared therapy are detoxification, pain relief, weight loss, lower blood pressure, improvement of circulation and skin purification. \"Dr. Frigerio is unlike any doctor I have ever been to.
