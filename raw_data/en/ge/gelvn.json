Frequently Asked Questions Shampoo bars vs. liquid shampoo: What is better? The efficacy of any shampoo depends on its ingredients. Besides, your hair type also determines what kind of shampoo is better for you. However, shampoo bars are travel-friendly as well as a sustainable alternative to liquid shampoo. Are shampoo bars healthier? Shampoo bars are eco-friendly and are made from natural and organic ingredients. A hydrating shampoo bar is devoid of harmful chemicals that can be found in liquid shampoo. Are shampoo bars good for thinning hair? A crucial feature of shampoo bars is that they don't strip your hair. Most bars are formulated with essential and plant-based oils like jojoba oil and sunflower seed oil that deeply nourish both your hair and scalp, boosting its health and promoting hair growth. While shampoo bars can work well for thinning hair, don't forget to check out the ingredients before making a purchase. Which shampoo bar is best for dandruff? There are several shampoo bars that are crafted to fight dandruff. Take a look at the list above to find your right match. Why should you switch to shampoo bars? As mentioned earlier, they are more sustainable than liquid shampoo. They don't come in plastic bottles reducing plastic waste and they also act as a conditioner. They are made from natural ingredients and do not contain harmful preservatives, making for a healthier option for your damaged hair and scalp. Besides, they do not take up a lot of space in your suitcase, if you're traveling. They are also more long-lasting than liquid shampoo. Why does my hair feel greasy after using a shampoo bar? Some hair wash bars can leave your hair waxy because they are soap bars. Many shampoo bars are made by mixing various oils with some kind of alkali. If your scalp is already oily, you must opt for a shampoo bar that's specially curated to treat oily scalp. How long does it take hair to adjust to a shampoo bar? The transition period depends on the quality of your hair and scalp. It can vary from person to person. The usual period can range from a few days to a few weeks and at times, even a month. How often should I wash my hair with a shampoo bar? Ideally, the frequency of washing your hair with a shampoo bar is the same as with liquid shampoo. Don't wash your hair more than 3-4 times a week. Do you need to condition after using a shampoo bar? Shampoo bars are usually made from conditioning oils. So, they act both as a cleansing bar and a conditioner. That's one great advantage of using shampoo bars and not artificial beauty products.
