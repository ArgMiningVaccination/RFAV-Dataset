Inthisenvironment, industry mustbewilling technical provide anenvironment thatencourages private innovation. Speakers mentioned low interest rates, taxincentives forR&D, liberalized export controls, andimproved conditions fortrade.

Public investment maximize thesocial thehigh technical risksandthelongtimeframes involved.

In fact,they don't really getinvolved inanything much beyond what's necessary tostay in business. There aredifferent types ofsmall businesses. Themost familiar type isthespinoff from a large corporation, where some very bright technical people decided theycould build abetter ashtray But that's probably anaberration rather thanthenorm forsmall businesses. Small firms aremostly oblivious togovernment technology development. Small businesses alsoarevery independent; companies are\"status quo\" users oftechnology. They take little initiative, mainly because can't afford it.Their resources arescarce andtheyhave cashflow payroll andpaying thebills, they don'thave the credit reputation, staying power, orinfluence of,say,GE.Most small businesses, therefore, look strictly athowtheycancreate profits intheshort giving littlethought tolong-term capabilities orneeds. They arenottapped totheir business andthey see itasameans ofcreating wealth intheshort term. While aresome time tothink about thenuances intheircompany. American philosophy ofpragmatism. Small business can't afford topioneer technologies, unless that istheir They with tried-and-true technology.

Small andalotof good ideasmaynever gel. Howdowegetsmall involving government, academia, andbig businesses concerning where ourtechnology thrusts should be. thecapabilities companies. Wehave to improve their planning, implementation skills, andidentification-of-opportunity skills. Someone said earlier that,perhaps, inthenext century, ifthat's technical oftheagricultural need tobeable todothese things without great consternation, andwithout losing money while andagood standard ofliving~andthattheyhave to participate inthispartnership. 151 Interagency Perspective Joseph Bordogna Assistant Director forEngineering National Science Foundation Theprogram saysweshould \"findways ofimproving how industry thatahigh-level entity inthegovernment should coordinate agency activities andoversee anational interagency effort, with industry an intimate member oftheteam. Well, there issuchanentity. Actually, therehavebeentwo Federal groups. TheoldonewastheFederal onScience, (FCCSET), acting asacatalyst forinvestment ofpublic funds inhigh-risk partnerships. Others have explained funds go. Sogovernment should dofour things: respond toindustry sureindustry is involved upfrontwith pursue projects inkeeping with (we can'tdoitadhocbecause interests), issueofgetting isaFederal thatsays industry can'tbe involved upfront. Iwasasked tochair theFCCSET Advanced Manufacturing Working Group when Ifirstcame totheNational Science Foundation (NSF) acouple of years ago, firstcouple ofmeetings with20great people aresmart, wellversed inwhat's going on,andknow alotabout mymind that Iwasafraid toask.Onewas,how many experiment committee ofVehicles isan Reinvestment (TRP) plustheEnvironmental is amuch broader concept. Thecarwillbesafer, better, cleaner, andmore energy efficient ~all those things. There isalsoanNSTC electronics initiative. Now, there aren't three major companies in electronics asthere areintheautomobile industry. Thus,weseethateach sector needs adifferent inandoutofthemeetings. how togetthatup-front input. Another theme running through allthese meetings, more sothanwithFCCSET, is simultaneous movement toward creating wealth while protecting theenvironment. The environmental technologies committee wealth byintegrating them intotheindustrial enterprise. The government perhaps canactinsynergy with theenvironmental technologies industry andhelp foster wealth creation, ofpeople~bigcompanies, small companies, technology experts, academics, andenvironmentalists ~tospend several days talking toeach other. This isanother wayofgetting industrial practitioners involved in conceptualizing government programs. Finally, wehave themanufacturing infrastructure committee, active infiveareas manufacturing processes andequipment, astheydevelop toestablish technology opportunities andlinkthem with industrial need. Tosummarize, thegovernment mixes with industry indifferent There isnooneway to dothis.Theselection oftheapproach isdriven partly theCongress mandated some action inthis area.There were nine different mandated programs, which eventually were folded into three: manufacturing technology development, deployment, and manufacturing engineering education. Theindividuals developing theTRP gottogether at leastone fulldayaweek, sometimes two, wasthateachagency should ThePresident wanted thisproject launched; this Administration work~notthepromise ofapiece ofthe$500 both theFederal Government andwith industry, universities, andresearch institutions outside thegovernment.

Secondly, thepoint hasbeenmade about setting program priorities, which iswhere industry collaboration comes in.Myconcern relates everyone. Another generic area isprocess equipment. Weheard thatthefoodandtextile industries use foreign process equipment. there areeight ethnic groups different languages; thelargest group forthe notonly can'tusetechnology achieve through lean production principles. But applied leanproduction principles, thentechnology will probably canhelp inthis area,because there arecost- freeways toimplement statistical process control, mistake proofing, andother things theMIT team writes about. Small companies canlearn these things fairly easily; noinvestment is required andtheresults areevident quickly. This leads tomyfifthpoint building aninfrastructure forindustrial assistance and deployment. This can'tbeapassing fad.Oncewestartbuilding industrial assistance centers, ormanufacturing technology Technology Centers (MTCs). medium-sized research isgoing on. My lastpoint echoes earlier comments about small companies. There isageneral euphoria about thegovernment getting involved Their interaction withgovernment intheformoftaxes, What needs tobedone companies intotheprocess? Idon't have theanswer. 163 1 i Panel Discussion Cynthia Arnold-McKenna: anduniversities jointly identify specific technologies thatshould receive future emphasis.

I'dlikeustothink about identifying cross-industry needs, deciding which technologies to focus on,establishing national priorities, andmatching government programs aneffort tomatch Gillman: muchmore emphasis onthat.There aresome really creative projects, some involving teaching graduate students computer modeling andsimulation.

The Intelligent Manufacturing Systems project isanexample ofaJapanese initiative addressing technological development onaglobal perspective.

These include physics, chemistry, engineering, mathematics, andcomputer sciences. Papers cover a broad range ofsubjects, withmajor emphasis onmeasurement methodology andthebasic technology underlying standardization. Also included from time totime aresurvey articles ontopics closely related to theInstitute's ayear. andindustrial practice (including safety codes) devel- oped incooperation with interested industries, professional organizations, andregulatory bodies. Special Publications \u2014Include proceedings ofconferences sponsored byNIST, NIST annual reports, and other special publications appropriate tothisgrouping such aswall charts, pocket cards, andbibliographies. National Standard Reference Data Series\u2014Provides quantitative dataonthephysical andchemical properties ofmaterials, compiled from theworld's literature and critically evaluated. Developed under a worldwide program coordinated byNIST information developed attheInstitute onbuilding materials, components, systems, andwhole structures. The series presents research results, testmethods, and performance criteria related tothestructural andenvironmental ofwork performed atNIST under thesponsorship of other government agencies.
