However, the benefits that come with such a decision are limitless, and this process is a vital one in forging a new life free from crystal meth. What is crystal meth detox? A crystal meth detox refers to a process where your body is cleared of all traces of the drug, cleansing your system of any harmful or toxic chemicals as you start on your recovery journey. This can be done naturally by abstaining from the drug, or through a medical detox, where you are weaned off the crystal meth gradually to reduce the intensity of withdrawal symptoms. What happens during a crystal meth detox? The first thing that must be done when coming off crystal meth is detoxing from the substance and putting healthy nutrients back into your body with a healthy diet.

This means that, after the drug wears off, they will likely undergo a 'crash period', feeling exhausted and drained of energy. Following this, users will start to undergo symptoms of acute withdrawal as their body jump-starts the [detox process](https://www.sanctuarylodge.com/detox/).
