This day aims at marking the importance of homeopathy and its contributions to traditional medicine. This day also honors the memory of Dr. Christian Friedrich Samuel Hahnemann \u2014 the founder of homeopathy. Samuel Hahnemann was born in 1755 and grew up in Meissen in Germany. He received his medical degree in Erlangen in 1779. Homeopathy comes from 'homeo' and 'pathos,' Greek words. Homeo means similar and pathos means suffering or disease. One of the most striking features of homeopathy is that it was described as quackery, irregular, fringe, or complementary and alternative medicine (CAM.) History of World Homeopathy Day The founder of homeopathy was Samuel Hahnemann, a French physician, scientist, and great scholar. During his first 15 years as a physician \u2014 while struggling desperately to make a living \u2014 he made a discovery. He believed that if patients had an illness, they had to be given the ingredients that induce symptoms of the said illness to cure the disease. Thus, if a patient was suffering from severe fever, he was given a medicine that in a healthy person would provoke a high fever. Hahnemann claimed to be able to compile a selection of appropriate remedies, by a process he called 'proving'. This gave rise to a famous aphorism \"like cures like.\" Homeopathy remedies are made with natural ingredients since they come from plants, minerals, or animals. Examples of these ingredients are red onions, arnica (a mountain herb), poison ivy, stinging nettle, white arsenic, and crushed whole bees. To determine a treatment for a person not only will a homeopath consider detailed pathology but also all of the person's symptoms including physical, mental, or emotional. This is one of the things that make a difference between traditional medicine and homeopathy \u2014 as homeopaths hold long consultations lasting at least an hour with their patients. Homeopathy is used to treat a variety of diseases, for example, allergies, migraines, depression, chronic fatigue syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, irritable bowel syndrome, and premenstrual syndrome. According to the \"National Institute of Health,\" more than six million people use homeopathy to treat specific health conditions in the U.S., and over 200 million people use homeopathy on regular basis worldwide. World Homeopathy Day timeline Christian Friedrich Samuel Hahnemann, also known as Samuel Hahnemann, is born in Paris. He receives his medical degree in Erlangen.
