Andrew Blake2, Faunce1, T. Kim D. Janda2and Matthew L. Banks1 The current opioid crisis remains a signi cant public health issue and there is a critical need for biomedical research to develop effective and easily deployable candidate treatments. One emerging treatment strategy for opioid use disorder includesimmunopharmacotherapies or opioid-targeted vaccines. The present study determined the effectiveness of a fentanyl-tetanustoxoid conjugate vaccine to alter fentanyl self-administration using a fentanyl-vs.-food choice procedure in male and female rats under three experimental conditions. For comparison, continuous 7-day naltrexone (0.01 -0.1 mg/kg/h) and 7-day clonidine (3.2-10g/kg/h) treatment effects were also determined on fentanyl-vs.-food choice. Male and female rats responded for concurrently available 18% diluted Ensure \u00ae(liquid food) and fentanyl (0 -10g/kg/infusion) infusions during daily sessions. Under baseline and saline treatment conditions, fentanyl maintained a dose-dependent increase in fentanyl-vs.-food choice. First, fentanyl vaccine administration signi cantly blunted fentanyl reinforcement and increased food reinforcement for 15 weeks in non-opioid dependent rats. Second, surmountability experiments by increasing the unit fentanyl dose available during the self-administration session 10-fold empirically determined that the fentanyl vaccine produced an approximate 22-fold potency shift in fentanyl-vs.- food choice that was as effective as the clinically approved treatment naltrexone. Clonidine treatment signi cantly increased fentanyl-vs.-food choice. Lastly, fentanyl vaccine administration prevented the expression of withdrawal-associated increases infentanyl-vs.-food choice following introduction of extended 12 h fentanyl access sessions. Overall, these results support the potential and further consideration of immunopharmacotherapies as candidate treatments to address the current opioid crisis. Neuropsychopharmacology (2019) 44:1681 -1689; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41386-019-0385-9 INTRODUCTION The United States opioid crisis has resulted in a 493% increase in the diagnosis of opioid use disorder (OUD) from 2010 to 2016 [ 1]. Unfortunately, those who misuse illicit opioids are increasingly likely to consume, either knowingly or unknowingly, potent synthetic opioids such as fentanyl. For example, reported fataloverdoses from fentanyl and other synthetic opioids totaled19,413 in 2016, an increase of 646% compared to 2010 [ 2]. Limitations in both effectiveness and deployment with current Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved pharmacothera-pies such as the partial MOR agonist buprenorphine and theopioid antagonist naltrexone [ 3,4] highlight the need for both preclinical and clinical research to develop more effective and readily available OUD treatments to address the opioid crisis. Recently, the National Institutes of Health described several scienti c areas to focus efforts toward the development of novel OUD treatment strategies [ 5]. One strategy includes using opioid- targeted vaccines to elicit antibody production by the host 's immune system that recognize and selectively block the passage of a speci c opioid into the brain and peripheral organs/tissue (i.e.,immunopharmacotherapies: [ 6-8]). Immunopharmacotherapies may offer several advantages over current FDA-approved OUD treatments [ 6]. First, anti-opioid antibodies have so far not been shown to interact with any known receptors or proteins, suggesting that undesirable effects should be minimal [ 9-11]. Second, because the anti-opioid antibodies do not enter the brain,this treatment strategy should not affect endogenous brain opioidsignaling, unlike current FDA-approved treatments (e.g., naltrex- one, buprenorphine, methadone). Third, anti-fentanyl antibodies may have long half-lives, which would be hypothesized toextended inter-treatment intervals and increase compliance.Finally, because the antibodies have a high degree of speci city for the target opioid, a vaccinated subject could be treated with other structurally dissimilar opioids for pain management (e.g.,oxycodone) or combined with current FDA-approved OUD treat- ments (e.g., buprenorphine or naltrexone). The aim of the present study was to determine the effectiveness and time course of a conjugate fentanyl-TT vaccine on intravenous(IV) fentanyl self-administration using a fentanyl-vs.-food choice procedure in male and female rats. Although preclinical studies Received: 3 January 2019 Revised: 19 February 2019 Accepted: 1 April 2019 Published online: 2 May 20191Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine, Richmond, VA 23298, USA;2Departments of Chemistry and Immunology and Microbial Science, Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology, Worm Institute for Research and Medicine, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, C A 92037, USA;3Department of Chemistry, Southern Connecticut State University, 501 Crescent St, New Haven, CT 06515, USA and4Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, \u00a9American College of Neuropsychopharmacology 2019have previously shown opioid-targeted vaccines to reduce rates of opioid self-administration [ 12-15], there are no published studies examining whether opioid-targeted vaccines would not only decrease opioid-taking behaviors, but also increase behaviordirected towards more adaptive nondrug reinforcers, consistentwith OUD treatment goals [ 16,17]. Thus, a fentanyl-vs.-food choice procedure was used because preclinical choice procedures have increasingly shown translational concordance to both humanlaboratory studies and double-blind placebo-controlled clinicaltrials in the evaluation of candidate medications for substance use disorders [ 18-20]. Two experimental conditions were examined. First, vaccine effectiveness to attenuate fentanyl-vs.-food choicewas examined under daily 2-h fentanyl access conditions.Continuous 7-day naltrexone treatment was utilized as a positive control because naltrexone is FDA approved for OUD in non- dependent individuals [ 21,22]. Continuous 7-day treatment with the 2adrenergic agonist clonidine was selected as an active negative control. Clonidine will relieve some somatic opioid withdrawal signs in opioid-dependent OUD patients and has beenshown to decrease stress-induced reinstatement in rats as well asreduce the risk of relapse when used as an adjunct to buprenorphine in humans [ 23-25]. However, clonidine does not prevent relapse when used as a monotherapy [ 26]. In a second series of experiments, the vaccine was evaluated for its ability toprevent withdrawal-associated increases in fentanyl-vs.-food choice following extended (12 h/day) fentanyl access. A previous study showed that 12 h extended fentanyl access produced opioiddependence as demonstrated by naloxone-precipitated somatic withdrawal signs [ 27]. Furthermore, opioid withdrawal will also increase opioid vs. non-opioid choice in both monkeys and rats[28,29]. In addition, these withdrawal-associated increases in opioid choice have been implicated as one critical driver of opioid abuse and hypothesized to be an important target for OUD treatment development [ 30-32]. MATERIALS AND METHODS SubjectsA total of 19 Sprague-Dawley rats (9 male, 10 female) wereacquired at 10 weeks of age (Envigo Laboratories, Frederick, MD, USA) and surgically implanted with vascular access ports (Instech, Plymouth Meeting, PA) and custom-made jugular catheters asdescribed previously [ 33]. Rats were singly housed in a temperature and humidity-controlled vivarium that was main- tained on a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights off at 1800 hours). Waterand food (Teklad Rat Diet, Envigo) were provided ad-libitum in thehome cage. Behavioral testing was conducted ve days per week from approximately 1400 -1600 hours unless otherwise noted. Rat maintenance and research were conducted in accordance withthe 2011 guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals andprotocols were approved by the Virginia Commonwealth Uni- versity Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Self-administration apparatus and catheter maintenance Twelve modular operant chambers located in sound-attenuating cubicles (Med Associates, St. Albans, VT) were equipped with tworetractable levers, a set of three LED lights (red, yellow, green)mounted above each lever, and a retractable cup (0.1 ml) located between the levers for delivering diluted liquid food (18% v/v vanilla flavor Ensure \u00aein tap water; Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL). Intravenous (IV) fentanyl was delivered by a syringe pump(PHM-100, Med Associates) located inside the sound-attenuating cubicle as described previously [ 34]. After each behavioral session, catheters were flushed with gentamicin (0.4 mg) followed by 0.1 ml of heparinized saline (30 U/ml). Catheter patency was veri ed periodically and at study end by instantaneous muscle tone loss following IV methohexital (0.5 mg) administration.Fentanyl vs. food choice After stable responding for IV fentanyl (3.2 \u00b5g/kg/infusion) and liquid food (18% diluted Ensure \u00ae) alone, rats were trained to respond under a fentanyl-vs.-food choice procedure modi ed from drug-vs.-food choice procedures in rats [ 35] and monkeys [31,36,37]. The behavioral session consisted of ve 20-min response components each preceded by a 4-min \"sample \" component. Each sample component started with a non-contingent infusion of the unit fentanyl dose available duringthe subsequent response component followed by a 2-min time out. Next, a 5-s presentation of liquid food was programmed followed by a 2-min time out. Following this second time out, theresponse component would begin. During each responsecomponent, both levers were extended, a red stimulus light above the left lever was illuminated to signal liquid food availability and a green stimulus light above the right lever wasilluminated to signal IV fentanyl availability. Response requirement (xed-ratio; FR5) completion on the left lever resulted in a 5-s presentation of liquid food whereas response requirement (FR5)completion on the right lever resulted in the delivery of the IVfentanyl dose available for that component. Responding on one lever reset the ratio requirement for the other lever. The liquid food concentration was constant throughout the session. Adifferent fentanyl dose was available during each of the ve successive response components (0, 0.32, 1.0, 3.2, and 10 \u00b5g/kg/inf during components 1 -5, respectively). Fentanyl dose was varied by changing the infusion duration (e.g. 300 g rat: 0, 0.5, 1.56, 5,and 15.6 s during components 1 -5, respectively) and the green light above the fentanyl-lever flashed on and off in 3 s cycles (i.e. longer flashes associated with larger fentanyl doses). During each response component, rats could complete up to 10 total ratio requirements between the food- and fentanyl- associated levers. Each ratio requirement completion initiated a 20-s time out, the retraction of both levers, and extinction of thered and green stimulus lights. If all 10 ratio requirements werecompleted before 20 min had elapsed, then both levers retracted, and stimulus lights were extinguished for the remainder of that component. Choice was considered stable when the smallest unitfentanyl dose that maintained at least 80% of completed ratiorequirements on the fentanyl-associated lever was within a 0.5 log unit of the running mean for three consecutive days with no trends. Once these criteria were met, choice testing occurredMonday through Thursday each week unless otherwise speci ed. Warm water tail withdrawal A water bath (Precision, 280 Series Water Bath, Winchester, VA) wasmaintained at 50 \u00b0C (\u00b11 \u00b0C). Each session began by gently wrapping the rat with a towel, leaving the tail exposed. The distal ve cm of the tail was immersed in heated water (50 \u00b0C) and the latency tofully remove the tail was recorded with a digital chronograph with a0.01 s resolution (Sports Timer, Fisher Brand, Hampton, NH). If the rat did not remove its tail by 20 s, the experimenter removed the tail and a latency of 20 s was assigned. Following baseline latencydetermination, IV saline or fentanyl was administered followed by a 0.1 ml saline flush and tail-withdrawal latency was redetermined 60 s later. The pretreatment time was based on published IV fentanyltime-course data [ 38]. Saline was always injected rst, followed by cumulative fentanyl doses (1 -1000 \u00b5g/kg) administered in 0.5 log dose increments. Testing continued until a maximum latency of 20 s was observed. Tail-withdrawal test sessions occurred each Fridayunless otherwise speci ed. Fentanyl vaccine experiments Following baseline data collection (i.e., M-Th, choice testing; F, tailwithdrawal; Week 0), six rats (three males, three females) were vaccinated on Monday at weeks 1 and 3 (Timeline: Fig. 2a). Fentanyl hapten was conjugated to TT as described [ 39]Conjugate vaccine produces long-lasting attenuation of saline. Fentanyl hapten copies were approximately 23 per protein based on a bovine serum albumin (BSA) surrogate [ 9,39]. On a per rat basis, 250 g conjugate fentanyl-TT hapten was mixed with 50 g phosphorothioate-modi ed CpG ODN 1826 (Euro ns Genomics, Louisville, KY) and 0.75 mg alhydrogel adjuvant 2% (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA) for 30 min and then refrigerated 24 h prior to IP administration. Every two weeks after the initial vaccination, tailvein blood was collected under iso flurane anesthesia into lithium heparin tubes (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Tubes were immediately centrifuged at 3300 RPM for 15 min (Ample Scienti c, Model E33- 1, Norcross, GA) and serum was pipetted into microcentrifugetubes and stored at 80 \u00b0C until analyzed. Anti-fentanyl titer and afnity measurements were performed as previously described [39]. Rats did not participate in behavioral tests on days when either fentanyl vaccine administration or blood collectionoccurred, resulting in an abbreviated testing week (i.e., T-Th, choice testing; F, tail withdrawal). To determine the robustness of fentanyl vaccine effectiveness, two additional experiments were conducted. First, the four ratsthat maintained catheter patency at week 17 were vaccinated (375 of hours after a Friday fentanyl tail-withdrawal test. Two days later, the four vaccinated rats (two male,two female) and six nonvaccinated rats (three male, three female; not used elsewhere) were allowed to self-administer fentanyl (3.2 \u00b5g/kg/infusion) under an FR5, 10 s time out schedule ofreinforcement during daily 12-h sessions from 1800 to 0600hours 5 days per week for 14 days in addition to the daily 2-h fentanyl- vs.-food choice sessions from 1400 to 1600 hours (i.e., precedingM-F choice sessions). The six nonvaccinated rats had an average(SEM) of 10.8 (1.2) weeks of fentanyl self-administration history under the choice procedure before this experiment. During these extended access sessions, fentanyl availability was signaled by theextension of the left lever and green stimulus light illuminationabove the left lever. During the time-out period, the stimulus light was extinguished, and the left lever was retracted. Second, these four vaccinated rats (two male, two female) were tested in a single fentanyl-vs.-food choice session whereinthe available unit fentanyl doses were increased 10-fold (i.e., 3.2 -100 \u00b5g/kg/infusion) relative to the original dose range (i.e., 0.32 -10 \u00b5g/kg/infusion). All other aspects of the choice procedure were identical. This test session occurred on Tuesday of week 21 and a tail-withdrawal test occurred on Friday. Chronic naltrexone and clonidine treatment experiments Following baseline fentanyl-vs-food choice and fentanyl antinoci- ception determination, seven non-vaccinated rats (3 male, 4 female) were aseptically implanted with osmotic pumps (Alzet,Model 2001, Cupertino, CA) in the mid-scapular subcutaneousregion under iso flurane anesthesia after a tail-withdrawal test. Following pump implantation, fentanyl-vs.-food choice and tail- withdrawal testing resumed on M-Th and F, respectively. Afterthe tail-withdrawal test, rats were again anesthetized with isoflurane, and the pump was removed. Once fentanyl-vs.-food choice and fentanyl tail-withdrawal latencies returned to baselinelevels, were saline, (0.01, 0.032, (3.2, 10 \u00b5g/kg/h). The maximum naltrexone dose (0.1 mg/kg/h) was based its saline solubility(i.e., approximately 40 mg/ml) and the maximum clonidine dose(10 \u00b5g/kg/h) was based on sustained lethargy in some rats. Saline and naltrexone were incorporated into a counterbalanced dosing order before the counterbalanced clonidine dose order. Data analysis For fentanyl-vs.-food choice studies, the primary dependentmeasures were percent fentanyl choice, de ned as (number ofratio requirements, or 'choices ', completed on the fentanyl- associated lever/total number of choices completed on both levers) \u00d7100 and number of choices per component. Data were rst averaged within a rat across M-Th (or T-Th, if blood collection or vaccine administration occurred) and then averaged betweenrats to yield group mean data. Results were then plotted as a function of the fentanyl dose and analyzed using a mixed-model analysis (JMP Pro 12) with either vaccination week or treatmentdrug dose and fentanyl dose as the xed main effects. A Dunnett ' s test was performed to compare treatment effects within a fentanyl dose. In addition, log ED 50values (\u00b195% condence limits) of percent fentanyl choice and choices per component were calculated using linear regression when at leastthree points were above and below the 50% effect level or interpolation when only two data points were available. Furthermore, if percent fentanyl choice did not surpass 50% orif a 50% reduction in choices per component was not observed, a value of 100% or 0% was assigned to the next highest 0.5 log dose for percent fentanyl choice or choices per component,respectively. This contingency was used to facilitate theconservative estimation of surmountability of the vaccine 's effects on choice-related measures (i.e., Fig. 4), as the choice function of a single female rat was unaffected by the presentationof a 10-fold higher fentanyl unit dose range, exclusively choosingten food presentations in all components. Tail-withdrawal latencies were expressed as percent max- imum administration, and saline latency the %MPE ED 50values (\u00b195% con dence limits) were calculated as described above. A treatment was considered to be signi cantly different if 95% con dence limits did not overlap. For the extended fentanyl access studies, the number of fentanyl infusions earned during the 12-h sessions were compared between vaccinated and non-vaccinated rats using a two-way ANOVA, with time as the within-subjects factor and vaccinationstatus as the between-subjects factor. A signi cant interaction was followed by a Sidak post-hoc test to compare fentanyl infusions at each day between groups. Fentanyl choice data (i.e., percent fentanyl choice and choices per component) were categorized bytheir proximity to the extended access sessions (i.e., Day 1, Days 2-6, Days 9 -13) and analyzed separately for vaccinated and non- vaccinated rats using a mixed-model analysis (JMP Pro 12) withextended access category and fentanyl dose as the xed main effects. Following a signi cant interaction, a Dunnett 's test was performed to compare treatment effects within a fentanyl dose to data collected during Day 1. The criterion for signi cance was set a priori at the 95% con dence level ( p< 0.05). For the fentanyl choice surmountability experiment in the four rats (two males, two females) that maintained catheter patency, pre-vaccination log ED 50values (\u00b195% con dence limits) were compared to those obtained during vaccination week 21 on (1) percent fentanyl choice, (2) choices per component, and (3) % MPE. Values were considered to be different if 95% con dence limits did not overlap. Drugs Fentanyl HCl and ( )-naltrexone HCl were provided by the National Institute on Drug Abuse Drug Supply Program (Bethesda,MD) and dissolved in sterile saline. Clonidine HCl (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was purchased from commercial suppliers. Fentanyl, naltrexone, and clonidine solutions were passed through a 0.22-micron sterile lter (Millex GV, Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA) before administration. All drug doses were expressed as the salt forms listed above and delivered based on weights collectedweekly.Conjugate vaccine produces long-lasting attenuation of fentanyl-vs.-food choice and fentanyl antinociception Under baseline conditions, liquid food was chosen over no or small (0.32 and 1 \u00b5g/kg/infusion) fentanyl doses (dashed lines;Fig. 1a-c). As the fentanyl dose increased, behavior was reallocated to the fentanyl lever and the largest fentanyl dose (10 \u00b5g/kg/infusion) maintained near exclusive fentanyl choice. Additionally, choices per component decreased as a function ofincreasing fentanyl doses (dashed lines; Fig. 1d-f). The bottom lines; Fig. 1g-i) show baseline fentanyl antinoci- ception and a cumulative dose of 32 \u00b5g/kg produced 100%MPE in all rats. Raw tail-withdrawal latencies (\u00b1SEM) IV saline were10.2 s (\u00b10.4) s (\u00b11.0) for the vaccine and naltrexone/ clonidine treatment groups, respectively. No baseline group differences were detected for any endpoint.Vaccine effects on fentanyl choice and thermal antinociception Vaccine administration produced a signi cant and sustained decrease in fentanyl choice and reciprocal increase in food choice from weeks 5 to 15 (Fig. 1a: fentanyl dose: 0.001). In addition, com- pleted during the last two components signi cantly increased , with rats choosing liquid food over fentanyl to a greater extent compared to baseline (Fig. 1d: fentanyl dose: 99=28,p< 0.001). Results separated by sex are shown in Supplementary Fig. 2. Vaccine administration also signi cantly decreased fentanyl antinociceptive potency up (Fig. 1g).

Relative to pre-vaccination data, a 21.8-foldpotency shift in fentanyl choice was observed (4A: baseline ED 50 (95% CL): g/kg/inf (18.1 -127.4)). Similarly, a 15.8-fold shift in the rate-decreasing effects of fentanyl was observed (4B: baseline was observed (Fig. 4c: baseline ED 50: 127.2 g/kg (74.3 -217.7)). DISCUSSION The present study determined effectiveness of a fentanyl-TT conjugate vaccine on fentanyl self-administration in male and female rats over the course of 21 consecutive weeks. There werethree main ndings. First, vaccine administration essentially eliminated fentanyl choice and reciprocally increased food choice by week 4 of the vaccine schedule in all rats. Furthermore, vaccine effectiveness was as effective as 7-day treatment with the currentFDA-approved OUD pharmacotherapy naltrexone. Moreover, asustained reduction in fentanyl vs. food choice was demonstrated for 15 weeks in response to only two vaccinations. Second, vaccine administration blunted fentanyl self-administration during12-h extended fentanyl self-administration sessions and pre- vented the expression of opioid withdrawal-induced increases in fentanyl-vs.-food choice. Lastly, vaccine effectiveness to decreasefentanyl-vs.-food choice was only surmounted by increasing theunit fentanyl dose 10-fold, revealing an approximately 22-fold shift in fentanyl potency. Overall, these preclinical results support the further consideration of this conjugate fentanyl-TT vaccine toaddress the current opioid crisis. The present results using a within-session IV opioid-vs.-food choice procedure are consistent with previous heroin-vs.-food and remifentanil-vs.-food choi c es t u d i e si nn o n h u m a np r i m a t e s [31,32,40] and extend these previous ndings to the MOR agonist fentanyl and to rats. C ontinuous 7-day naltrexone treatment produced dose-dependent decreases in fentanyl vs. food choice and dose-dependent r ightward shifts in the fentanyl antinociception dose-effect fu nction. The present naltrexone results are consistent with and extend previous ndings with acute naltrexone [ 40] and continuous naloxone treatment [ 31] on opioid-vs.-food choice in rhes us monkeys. More importantly, these results are consistent with depot naltrexone treatment effects on heroin-vs.-money choice in humans [ 21]a n dc l i n i c a l trial effectiveness [ 41]. In contrast to naltrexone, continuous 7- day clonidine treatment increas ed fentanyl-vs. -food choice and failed to alter fentanyl antinociception. The present clonidine results are consistent with clon idine as a monotherapy failing to decrease opioid use in a clinical trial [ 26]. In summary, the present naltrexone and clonidin e results provide an appropriate empirical framework with both positive (naltrexone) and negative (clonidine) controls to critically evaluate candidatepharmacotherapies for OUD [ 42], such as a conjugate fentanyl vaccine. Two vaccine doses were suf cient to produce a robust decrease in fentanyl-vs.-food choice that was similar in magnitude tonaltrexone and sustained for 15 weeks. The present results areconsistent with previous studies examining the effectiveness of immunopharmacotherapies to attenuate opioid reinforcement [12-15,43,44]. However, these results also extend upon these previous ndings in three translationally important ways. First, these results demonstrate that an immunopharmacotherapy can result in increased choice of a non-drug reinforcer (i.e., liquid food)over the target opioid (i.e., fentanyl). This may be of particular Fig. 4 Surmountability of vaccine effects on fentanyl-vs.-food choice when the unit fentanyl dose was increased 10-fold. fentanyl dose a,b: unit dose; c: cumulative dose). aordinate: Percentage of completed ratio requirements on the fentanyl-associated lever.

Accordingly, treatment goals for OUD include not only decreasing behavior maintained by opioids but also increasing behavior maintained by non-drug reinforcers [6,16]. Second, the present study is the rst to utilize experimental parameters suf cient to detect a parallel rightward shift in an opioid reinforcement dose -response function following immu- nopharmacotherapy administration. A vaccine effect that wasonly detected after the unit IV fentanyl dose range wasincreased ten-fold. This demonstr ation of 22-fold shift) supports the inter pretation that anti-fentanyl antibodies provided a degree of fentanyl blockade suf cient to blunt fentanyl reinforcement until the anti-fentanyl anti- bodies became saturated, after which fentanyl was able to activate brain reinforcement circuitry. When considered along-side the positive correlation de monstrated between midpoint titer levels and the fentanyl ant inociceptive potency shifts throughout the experimental period, it appears that the maintenance of suf ciently high levels of antibodies will be a critical determinant of translationally relevant reductions infentanyl reinforcement. By demonstrating that a vaccine booster given over three months after t he second priming infusion recapitulated the peak antibody response, these results suggestthat vaccine ef cacy could be well maintai ned with a clinically- feasible, quarterly dosing regimen. Lastly, vaccine administration decreased rates of fentanyl self- administration during 12-h extended fentanyl access sessions andblocked the expression of opioid withdrawal-induced increases in fentanyl-vs.-food choice. The expression of opioid withdrawal- induced increases in fentanyl-vs.-food choice in nonvaccinatedrats following an abstinence period, including responding on theopioid-associated lever even when no opioid was available, was consistent with previous studies examining opioid-vs.-food choice in monkeys [ 28,31,32,46] and rats [ 29]. Opioid dependence and subsequent withdrawal-induced increases in opioid reinforcementhas been proposed as one critical component in the development and expression of OUD [ 30]. The present results demonstrate that immunopharmacotherapy administration may have the potentialto prevent the development and expression of opioid depen- dence and subsequent withdrawal-induced increases in opioid reinforcement. Although the present resul ts provide compelling and encouraging evidence for the the rapeutic potential of opioid- targeted vaccines, the unique c hallenges posed by immuno- pharmacotherapies in the treatment of OUD should also beconsidered. Three will be mentio ned. First, the effectiveness of an immunopharmacotherapy is dependent upon two factors (1) the production of suf ciently high levels of viable titers by the immunized subject 's immune system and (2) the antibody afnity for the drug. This latter factor is critical because fentanyl 'sa fnity for the MOR is in the low nanomolar range. This suggests that, unlike current FDA-approved OUD treat-ments that directly target opioid receptors, responsiveness toopioid-targeted vaccine admini stration will be dependent on the individual 's ability to generate a suf cient immune response to the drug and an immunocompromised individual may not be a suitable patient for drug-targeted immunopharmacotherapy.Second, the onset of peak vaccine effectiveness from the rst vaccine administration was on the order of weeks. This lag time could leave subjects vulnerable to the effects of the targetedopioid during this vaccine induction period. One strategy for mitigating this vulnerability could be to combine a vaccine with depot naltrexone, buprenorph ine, and/or an anti-drug mono- clonal antibody during the vaccine induction period. Finally,because antibodies elicited by o pioid-targeted vaccines have a high degree of speci city, an individual could circumvent vaccine effects by misusing a structurally dissimilar opioid. For example, the fentanyl vaccine ut ilized in the present studies has been shown to exhibit \"pan-speci city\"towards a variety of fentanyl analog ues, including -methylfentanyl, fentanyl, and carfentanil [ 9,39]. Yet, this same fentanyl vaccine elicited antibodies displaying very weak af nity towards structurally dissimilar opioids such as methadone and oxyco-done [ 9,39]. Accordingly, recent preclinical research has explored the development of combination immunopharma- cotherapy approaches directed at multiple, structurally dissim-ilar abused opioids (e.g., fentanyl and heroin) [ 47]. Furthermore, antibody speci city elicited by a combination opioid-targeted vaccine would also maintain the flexibility of a patient being treated with a structurally dissimi lar opioid (e.g. oxycodone) for pain management. In conclusion, opioid-targeted vaccines may provide for a unique clinically effective option for OUD treatment and the present preclinical evidence supports theircontinued development and eval uation in human laboratory drug-vs.-money choice stud ies and clinical trials.
