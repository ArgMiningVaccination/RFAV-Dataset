Also known as flower essences, these are highly diluted extracts from the flowers of wild plants. There are many types of flower remedies from around the world. The most well known in Australia are the Original Bach Flower Remedies, developed in the 1930s in England, and Australian Bush Flower Essences, developed in Australia in the 1980s. Why use them Some people believe that flower remedies balance the mind, body and spirit, and help you cope with emotional problems, which can sometimes contribute to poor health. What to expect Much like a counselling session, the therapist will ask questions and listen to you talk about yourself, the problems you are experiencing and how you feel about or approach certain situations. This enables the therapist to prepare a remedy - usually a blend of essences - tailored specifically for you, which is taken in water several times a day. Always confirm the actual ingredients in the suggested remedy and discuss with your cancer care team before taking them. Some herbs may interact with some cancer treatments and medicines, and cause side effects. See [these tips on using herbs safely](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/cancer-information/living-well/complementary-therapies/safety-concerns/safety-of-herbs/). What is the evidence? Scientific evidence does not support the use of flower remedies for treating diseases. However, anecdotal evidence suggests they may be helpful for reducing fear, anxiety or depression. After surgery, my naturopath gave me Bach Flower Remedies for fear, shock and exhaustion. These helped me relax.Louise (bowel cancer) Meditation and Relaxation Podcast [Listen to more of our meditation and relaxation podcast for people affected by cancer](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/cancer-information/living-well/complementary-therapies/podcast-meditation-and-relaxation/) Key resource Download a PDF booklet on this topic.
