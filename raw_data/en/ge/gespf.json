Every person's journey is unique and each is here for a higher purpose. Therefore, I accompany you in healing techniques that identify and integrate your false-selves into wholeness, leading to authenticity, empowerment, and excellence. Healing leads to a restoration of wholeness and greater awareness of your Inner Light. Tapping into this light unwinds the Field that surrounds you and each of us, leading to a greater sense of love and belonging in the world and cosmos. Clients often report feeling gently held, profoundly understood, and guided in ways that arise from a powerfully honed and well-developed intuition. My practices are based on the knowledge that comes from years of intensive study and - more importantly - the deep wisdom that comes from my own spiritual practices and experience. I have clientele all over the world. I provide my services long-distance telephonically or via Zoom. Most clients choose to do one modality or the other, although you can choose to do both, depending on your individual journey. All clients benefit from whichever modality they choose. "}
