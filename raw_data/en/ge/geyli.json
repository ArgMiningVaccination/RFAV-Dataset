The 2022 AIHM Conference was held in-person, with attendees gathering in San Diego, California for live and virtual events. SCU has been working with AIHM since its inception in 2015, and has been a decades long standing sponsor of predecessor organizations, the [Academic Collaborative for Integrative Health](https://www.aihm.org/acih/) (ACIH), which merged with AIHM in 2021; and the [Academic Consortium for Complementary and Alternative Health Care](https://integrativehealth.org/) (ACCAHC). The annual AIHM Conference is an annual tradition bringing together global leaders to talk about the latest in evidence-based integrative health and medicine. The conference began over 44 years ago at the [American Holistic Medical Association](https://www.faim.org/american-holistic-medical-association-ahma) (AHMA) inaugural meeting in 1978 to learn and discuss tools to leverage practice. The 2022 AIHM Conference was the first in-person conference after spending two years meeting virtually during the COVID-19 response. The conference furthers the vision for transforming healthcare, from integrative women's health to cardiology updates, to the future of whole health, stress management and mental health, planetary health and connecting with the sacred and community. Panel discussions brought together some of the visionaries and leaders in integrative health to discuss equity and inclusion in integrative education, global disruption, and the future of medicine. \"We are at a unique point in the shared story of humanity,\" said [Tabatha Parker, ND](https://www.aihm.org/about-us/), AIHM Executive Director. \"We are gathering together to remind each other of how to blend science and the art of medicine, grace and heart, data and research, with a resounding strength and voice that is our global integrative community. We gather side-by-side with so many integrative leaders from acupuncture, anthroposophy, ayurvedic, chiropractic, dental, massage, medicine, midwifery, naturopathic, nursing, osteopathic, public health, research, somatic movement, yoga therapy....the list goes on and on.\" The AIHM DEI Panel goals are to equip learners with knowledge, skills, behaviors, and attitudes that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion to improve both clinical learning and patient outcomes. \"I am grateful for the opportunity to dialogue about the benefits of diversity, equity and inclusion in health education at the 2022 AIHM Conference,\" said PA Williams. \"And I am delighted to highlight the commitment of SCU to DEI. Currently there are significantly fewer medical practitioners of diverse backgrounds in the United States. The U.S. Census indicates a dramatic shift in the demographics of the U.S. population by 2045. Studies demonstrate improved patient experience ratings and health outcomes with increased diversity. An intentional approach to increasing DEI is warranted for the overall well-being of society as a whole.\" Presentation description: The Power of Neuroplasticity: How to use the results of a functional EEG to create treatment protocols for better brain health.

Explain brain health research as it relates to nutrition and dietary supplementation. Create movements and activities based on specific functional EEG results for better brain function. Presentation description: There is a growing body of research suggesting that yoga is beneficial for a variety of health outcomes. This has led many healthcare professionals to start recommending yoga to patients and clients. But not all yoga is created equal and not all yoga is appropriate for clinical populations. In this presentation, you will learn the differences between the professions of yoga teaching and yoga therapy, as well as how to make wise referrals for the safety and benefit of those who might benefit most, but who are also at greatest risk. Presentation description: The session discusses the opportunities for including integrative health practices (IHPs) in health promotion policies. Currently, there is hardly any explicit mention of IHPs in any health promotion and disease prevention policies. The presentation will specifically discuss about the evidence for selected practices that demonstrate a role in primary disease prevention. See full details in the [AIHM "}
