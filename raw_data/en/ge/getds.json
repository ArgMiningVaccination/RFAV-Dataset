Ayurveda began in ancient India more than 3,000 years ago. At the heart of this medical system is the belief that disease is caused by an imbalance in a person's environment, spirit, body, and mind. Lifestyle changes and natural remedies help restore this balance. Based on Ayurveda beliefs, every person has five elements (water, air, fire, space, and earth) in them. The elements create three doshas, or life forces, called pitta, vata, and kapha, which affect the chances of a person becoming sick. In Ayurveda, RA is referred to as amavata, a joint disease created by an imbalance of vata. Ayurvedic remedies work to restore the balance among body, spirit, and mind. There are different types of remedies and lifestyle changes that you can make.
