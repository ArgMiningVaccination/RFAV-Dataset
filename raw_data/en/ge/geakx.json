Outdoor areas Between the beautiful gardens, lakes, and parks, the Omaha area is in no shortage of outdoor areas. It is important for seniors to get outdoors to keep their vitamin D levels high and to prevent feelings of isolation. So, having access to a multitude of outdoor areas is a great benefit for local seniors. Omaha is home to over 250 parks and over 120 miles of [paved walking trails](https://parks.cityofomaha.org/parks/trails). Some of these trails are located in surrounding areas, like Council Bluffs. Along these paved trails, seniors and their families can take a break at camping sites, fishing areas, lakes, or picnic tables. These areas should not be explored alone by seniors with dementia, since confusion may occur and cause them to get lost. We recommend walking through these areas with your loved one or finding a caregiver to help them explore the area. The [RiverFront](https://theriverfrontomaha.com/) is spread across 72 acres and encompasses three parks between Old Market and downtown Omaha. With beautiful lakeside views and green grass areas, the RiverFront is easily accessible for wheelchairs or mobility assistance devices.

If a performance is not made to be sensory-friendly, O-pa offers sensory kits to help guests feel more relaxed.
