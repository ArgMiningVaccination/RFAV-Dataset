What is it? Cannabis is a plant that contains many types of chemicals called cannabinoids. These chemicals act on certain receptors found on cells in our body. Cannabinoids can also be made in a laboratory. Medicinal cannabis contains standard measures of cannabinoids. Two cannabinoids commonly used in medicinal cannabis are delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). What is the evidence? There is no evidence that medicinal cannabis can treat or cure cancer itself. Research studies have looked at the potential benefits of using medicinal cannabis to relieve cancer symptoms and treatment side effects. There is some evidence that cannabinoids can help people who have found conventional treatment unsuccessful for some symptoms and side effects (e.g. chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting). To date, published studies have shown medicinal cannabis to have little effect on appetite, weight, pain or sleep problems. Research is continuing in this area. Accessing medicinal cannabis It is illegal to grow, possess or use cannabis in Australia. However, the Australian Government allows seriously ill people to access medicinal cannabis for medical reasons through registered medical practitioners. Most medicinal cannabis products in Australia are unapproved products. This means that before prescribing medicinal cannabis, your doctor needs to get approval from the government. The laws about access to medicinal cannabis vary in each state and territory. These laws may affect whether it can be prescribed for you. The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) now allows low dose cannabis products containing up to 150 mg of CBD to be included on the [Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG)](http://tga.gov.au/resources/artg) and sold over the counter by pharmacists. As at January 2023, no product has been approved by the TGA. Medicinal cannabis may interact with some other drugs and also affect your driving ability. Talk with your doctor about any precautions you should take. For more information, visit the [Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA)](https://www.tga.gov.au/) and search for \"medicinal cannabis\".
