This outfit seemed to me to be so dangerous that a word of warning is in the public interest. Their own description says \"YES TO LIFE is a new charitable initiative to open up a positive future for people with cancer in the UK by supporting an integrative* approach to cancer care\". That sounds sort of cuddly but lets look below the surface. As so often, the funding seems to have been raised as the result of the death of an unfortunate 23 year old woman. Instead of putting the money into real research, yet another small charity was formed. My correspondent pointed out that \"I came across them at St Pancras Station on Friday afternoon \u2014 they had a live DJ to draw in the crowd and were raising funds through bucket collections\". No doubt many people just see the word 'cancer' and put money in the bucket, without realising that their money will be spent on promoting nonsensical and ineffective treatments. The supporters list. The [list of supporters](http://www.yestolife.org.uk/y2l/oursupporters.html) tells you all you need to know, if you are familiar with the magic medicine business, though it might look quite convincing if you don't know about the people. Sadly the list starts with some celebrities (I didn't know before that Maureen Lipman was an enthusiast foir quackery -how very sad). But never mind the air-head celebrities. The more interesting supporters come later. [Dr Rosy Daniel](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2881)of Health Creation is an old friend. After I complained about her promotion of some herbal concoction called Carctol to \"heal cancer\", she was reprimanded by Trading Standards for breaching the Cancer Act 1939, and forced to change the claims (in my view she should have neen prosecuted but, luckily of her, Trading Standards people are notoriously ineffective). There is, of course not the slightest reason to to think that Carctol works (download [Carctol: Profits before Patients?](http://dcscience.net/ernst-carctrol-2009.pdf)). Read also what Cancer Research UK [say about carctol](http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/about-cancer/treatment/complementary-alternative/therapies/carctol?script=true). Dr Daniel is also well known because ran a course that was, for one year, accredited by the University of Buckingham. But once the university became aware of the nonsense that was being taught on the course, they first removed her as the course director, and then [removed accreditation from the course](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2881)altogether. She then tried to run the course under the aegis of the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health, but even they turned her down. Now it is running as a private venture, and is being advertised by YesToLife. - Boo Armstrong, \"Chief Executive of The Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health and Founder and Executive Director GetWellUK\". The web site is out of date since the Prince's Foundation [shut its doors](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3023)a year ago. She runs a private company, GetWellUK, that was responsible for a very poor study of alternative medicine in Northern Ireland. So she has a vested interest in promoting it. See [Peter Hain and GetwellUK: pseudoscience and privatisation in Northern Ireland](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=33) - Professor George Lewith. This is beginning to look like the usual list of suspects. I've had cause to write twice about the curious activities of Dr Lewith. See [Lewith's private clinic has curious standards](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=131), in 2006, and this year [George Lewith's private practice. Another case study](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3956). The make up your own mind about whether you'd trust him. - Dr Michael Dixon OBE, Chairman NHS Alliance and Medical Director The Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health. Again the job description is a year out of date. You can read about Dr Dixon at [Prince of Wales Foundation for magic medicine: spin on the meaning of 'integrated'](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1466). He seems to be a well meaning man for whom no new-age idea is too barmy. In fact both Dixon and Lewith have moved to a reincarnation of the Prince's Foundation known as the \"College of Medicine\" (actually it's a couple of offices in Buckingham Street). See [Don't be deceived. The new \"College of Medicine\" is a fraud and delusion](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3632). It seems to me incomprehensible that people such as Sir Graeme Catto, Sir Cyril Chantler and Sir Muir Grey are willing to be associated with people who behave like this. - Charlotte Grobien, Managing Director, [Give it Away](http://www.give-it-away.co.uk/). This seems to be a fund-raising organisation that has supported YesToLife. The lesson seems to be, never give money to fundraisers unless you know exactly where your money is going. The Help Centre YesToLife has a [help centre](http://www.yestolife.org.uk/y2l/helpcentre.html). But beware, There is no medical person there. Just Traditional Chinese medicine ( [rather dangerous](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2923)), acupuncture, osteopath and naturopathy (which means, roughly, do nothing and hope for the best). Patrick Holford, There can be no better indication of the standard of advice to be expected from YesToLife than the fact they are advertising a lecture by Holford, with the enticing title \" [Say no to cancer](http://www.yestolife.org.uk/eents/seminars.html)\".\"Through learning about the effects of diet and nutrition, people with cancer or at risk of developing cancer can be empowered to say Yes to Life and No to Cancer\". Would that it were so easy. It will cost you \u00a315.00. Just in case there is still nobody who has heard of Holford, he is the media nutritionist who has an entire chapter devoted to him in Ben Goldacre's Bad Science book, He has a whole website that has exposed his dubious advice, the excellent [HolfordWatch](http://holfordwatch.info/). And you can find quite a lot about him [on this blog](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=Patrick+Holford). Try, for example, [Patrick Holford's CV: the strange case of Dr John Marks](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=44), and [Response to a threatening letter from Mr Holford](#), or [Holford's untruthful and unsubstantiated advertisement](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=163) The treatments directory Now we get to the truly scary bit of YesToLife, their [treatment directory](http://www.yestolife.org.uk/newresourcestart.php). Try searching for 'cancer type' and then \"breast (metastatic)\".. We find no mention of the advances in understanding of the genetics of breast cancer, nor ot real therapies like tamoxifen. What we find are four \"alternative treatments\". [Neuroimmunomodulation Therapy](javascript:mynewwindow(35))It sounds impressive until you learn that its only proponent is a an 82 year old Venezuelan doctor with a clinic in Caracas. Even YesToLife doesn't pretend that there is any evidence that it works [Vitamin C Therapy](javascript:mynewwindow(36))The old chestnut cure-all Vitamin C Again even YesToLife don't pretend there is any good evidence but it is still offered; treatment cost \u00a33140.00 (what? Vitamin C is very cheap indeed) [Dendritic Cell Therapy](javascript:mynewwindow(30))Said by YesToLife to be \"well-researched\", though that isn't so for breast cancer (metastatic). Although possibly not as barmy as the other things that are recommended, it is nevertheless not shown to be effective for any sort of cancer, [Gerson Therapy](javascript:mynewwindow(14))It is a sign of the extreme unreliability of advice given by YesToLife that they should still recommend anything as totally discredited as Gerson Therapy.Although YesToLife describes it as \"well-researched\" that is simply not true: there are no proper clinical trials. [Cancer Research UK say](http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/about-cancer/treatment/complementary-alternative/therapies/gerson-therapy?script=true) \"Overall, there is no evidence to show that Gerson therapy works as a cure for cancer. \" \"Available scientific evidence does not support claims that Gerson therapy can treat cancer. It is not approved for use in the United States. Gerson therapy can be very harmful to your health. Coffee enemas have been linked to serious infections, dehydration, constipation, colitis (inflammation of the colon), and electrolyte imbalances. In some people, particular aspects of the diet such as coffee enemas have been thought to be responsible for their death.\" Recommended reading: [The (Not-So-)Beautiful (Un)Truth about the Gerson protocol and cancer quackery](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=291), by David Gorski (breast cancer surgeon, writing in [Science-based Medicine](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?page_id=791). Conclusion The information supplied by YesToLife is more likely to kill you than to cure you. The next time you see somebody collecting for a \"cancer charity\" be very careful before you give them money. Follow-up November 2012. It gets worse. I had an email from someone who was distressed because a friend was trying to raise \u00a315,000 to cover the cost of treatments recommended by YesToLife. The treatment is high-dose intravenous Vitamin C infusion. This is pure quackery. There isn't the slightest reason to think it will affect the course of cancer, or the wellbeing of the patient. It is exploitation of the desperate. My heart sinks at the thought that a \"charity\" can be quite so wicked. The Prince of Wales' Foundation for Integrated Health [shut down amidst scandal](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3023) in April 2010. In July, we heard that a new \"College of Medicine\" was to arise from its ashes. It seemed clear [from the people involved](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263) that the name \"College of Medicine\" would be deceptive. Now the College of Medicine has materialised, and it is clear that one's worst fears were well justified. At first sight, it looks entirely plausible and well-meaning. Below the logo [one reads](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/about-college-medicine) \"There is a new force in medicine. A force that brings patients, doctors, nurses and other health professionals together, instead of separating them into tribes.\" \"That force is the new College of Medicine. Uniquely, it brings doctors and other health professionals together with patients and scientists.\" It is apparent from the outset that the well-meaning words fall into the trap described so clearly by James May (see [What 'holistic' really means](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3095)). It fails to distinguish between curing and caring. As always, the clue lies not in the words, but in the people who are running it. Who is involved? After a bit of digging on the web site, you find the names of the people on the [Science Council of the \"College of Medicine\"](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/science-council), The preamble says \"Good medicine must be grounded in good science as well as compassion. The College's Science Council brings a depth of knowledge from many senior figures.\" But then come the names. With the odd exception the \"science council\" is like a roll-call of quacks, the dregs left over from the Prince's Foundation. The link (attached to each name) gives the College's bio, My links tell a rather different story. - [Professor George Lewith](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/professor-george-lewith)You'll find plenty about [George Lewith on this blog.](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22George+Lewith%22) - [Professor Mustafa Djamgoz](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/professor-mustafa-djamgoz)Superficially respectable but seduced by 'ancient wisdom' He once wrote to me \"There are many 'eastern' remedies (such as acupuncture that we witnessed dismissed 25 year ago) that work. \".

There are a few gaps in this table, to be filled in soon. One can guarantee that a great deal more will appear about the College on the web, very soon. The [Governing Council of the College](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/governing-council) is equally replete with quacks (plus a few surprising names). It has on it, for example, a spiritual healer (Angie-Buxton King), a homeopath (Christine Glover), a herbalist (Michael McIntyre). Westminster University's king of woo (David Peters), not to mention the infamous [Karol Sikora](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22Karol+Sikora%22). Buxton-King [offers a remarkable service](#abk1) to heal people or animals at a distance. Meanwhile, it seemed worthwhile to provide a warning that the title of the College is very deceptive. It hides an agenda that could do much harm. It is, quite simply, the Prince of Wales by stealth. Follow-up 28 October 2010 Professor Sir Graeme Catto, who has, disgracefully, allowed his name to be used as president of this \"College\" has said to me \"There are real problems in knowing how to care for folk with chronic conditions and the extent of the evidence base for medicine is pretty limited\". Yes of course that is quite true. There are many conditions for which medicine can still do little. There is a fascinating discussion to be had about how best to care for them. The answer to that is NOT to bring in spiritual healers and peddlers of sugar pills to deceive patients with their fairy stories. The \"College of Medicine\" will delay and pervert the sort of discussion that Catto says, rightly, is needed. 29 October 2010 I need a press card. I see that the BMJ also had a piece about the \"College of Medicine\" yesterday: [Prince's foundation metamorphoses into new College of Medicine](http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c6126.full), by Nigel Hawkes. He got the main point right there in the title. As was [clear since July](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263), the driving force was Michael Dixon, Devon GP and ex medical director of the Prince's Foundation. Hawkes goes easy on the homeopaths and spiritual healers, but did spot something that I can't find on their web site. The \"Faculties\" will include \"in 2011, neuromusculoskeletal care. Two of the six strong faculty members for this specialty are from the British Chiropractic Association, which sued the author Simon Singh for libel for his disobliging remarks about the evidence base for their interventions.\" The College certainly picks its moment to endorse chiropractic, a subject that is in chaos and disgrace after they lost the Singh affair. One bit of good news emerges from Hawkes' piece, There is at least one high profile doubter in the medical establishment, Lord (John) Walton (his 2000 report on CAM was less than blunt, and has been widely misquoted by quacks) is reported as saying, at the opening ceremony \"I'm here as a sceptic, and I've just told my former houseman that,\" he said. The target of the remark was Donald Irvine, another former GMC president and a member of the new college's advisory council.\" 31 October 2010. I got an email that pointed out a remarkable service offered by a member of College's [Governing Council](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/governing-council). Angie Buxton-King, a \"spiritual healer\" employed by UCLH seems to have another web site, [The Beacon of Healing Light](http://www.angiebuxton-king.com/) that is not mentioned in [her biography](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/angie-buxton-king) on the College's site. Perhaps it should have been because it makes some remarkable claims. The [page about distant healing](http://www.angiebuxton-king.com/Distant_Healing.php) is the most bizarre. Absent Healing/Distant Healing \"Absent healing is available when it is not possible to visit the patient or it is not possible for the patient to be brought to our healing room. This form of healing has proved to be very successful for humans and animals alike.\" \"We keep a healing book within our healing room and every night spend time sending healing to all those who have asked for it. We have found that if a picture of the patient is sent to us the healing is more beneficial, we also require a weekly update to monitor any progress or change in the patients situation. Donations are welcome for this service.\" I wonder what the Advertising Standards people make of the claim that it is \"very successful\"? I wonder what the president of the College makes of it? I've asked him. Other blogs about the \"College of Medicine\" 30 October 2010. Margaret McCartney is always worth reading. As a GP she is at the forefront of medicine. She's written about the College in [The Crisis in Caring and dangerous inference](http://www.margaretmccartney.com/blog/?p=801). She's also provided some information about a \"professional member\" of the [College of Medicine](http://www.collegeofmedicine.eu/dr-sam-everington), in [..and on Dr Sam Everington, at the Bromley by Bow Centre....](http://www.margaretmccartney.com/blog/?p=803) It is one of the more insulting things about alternative medicine addicts that they claim to be the guardians of caring (as opposed to curing), They are not, and people like McCartney and Michael Baum are excellent examples. Prince of Wales to become honorary president of the \"College of Medicine?\" Last night I heard a rumour that the Prince of Wales is, despite all the earlier denials, to become Honorary President of the \"College\". If this is true, it completes the wholesale transformation of the late, unlamented, Prince's Foundation for Integrated Medicine into this new \"College\". Can anybody take it seriously now? Text messages to Graeme Catto and Michael Dixon, inviting them to deny the rumour, have met with silence. Herbal nonsense at the College 29 July 2011. I got an email from the College if Medicine [ [download it](http://www.dcscience.net/COM-Self-care.pdf)]. It contains a lot of fantasy about herbal medicines, sponsered by a company that manufactures them. It is dangeroous and corrupt. Suggested twitter tag: #buckgate | | Number 19 Buckingham Street, London WC2N 6EF.is to be the home of the proposed \"College of Medicine\" that has arisen from the ashes of the Naturally one must ask if the \"College of Medicine\" will propagate the same sort of barmy ideas as the Prince's Foundation used to do, A visit to Companies House shows the auguries are not good | | 19 Buckingham Street For one thing, the name College of Medicine has existed only since May 2010. The company was registered originally 19th November 2009 as The College of Integrated Health, but after a teleconference on 5th May 2010 it [changed its name](/col-med-name-change.pdf), presumably to make itself sound more like real medicine. This happened immediately after the [ closure of the Prince's Foundation](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3023) on April 30th. There is no doubt that the \"College of Medicine\" is the direct descendent of the Prince of Wales' Foundation. In a powerpoint show dated 9th November 2009 (before the name change) this slide is to be found. The author of the slide show is specified as \"Linda\". That, it is a fair bet, must be Linda Leung, who was Operations Director of the Prince's Foundation until it closed, and is now Company Secretary for the \"College of Medicine\". The final form of the \"College\" is still being argued about, but guess who will open it? When ask about how Charles' relationship with the College, The Office of TRH The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall declined to make any comment, but simply referred me to Michael Dixon, who, in turn referred me to Pat Goodall. Recently a statement from Clarence House to the Guardian said that \"the Prince of Wales was aware of the college, but \"has not been involved with setting-up the college, is not launching it and has no official role with it\". That's the official line anyway. It is, of course, almost impossible to find out exactly what the relationship is between Prince Charles himself and the new \"College\". He operates largely out of sight, and the Freedom of Information Act, disgracefully, excludes his interference in the democratic process from public scrutiny. Who is paying? Flat 5 at 19 Buckingham Street was recently valued at half a million pounds. There is some serious money behind this venture. The rumour is that it's from a 'private donor'. Small prize for anyone who finds out who it is. Aims of the College The stated object of the College is \"to advance health for the public benefit\". Sounds good, but what does it mean? It doesn't take long to find out. It is laid out in the [document from Companies House.](/blREX+0L0198-7358_6-05180774.pdf) To further its objects the Charity may: 7.1 engage with and develop communities of health professionals, health care providers and patients; 7.2 set standards and promote excellence in the fields of health and care; 7.3 lead, represent, train and support stakeholders so that they are better equipped to serve the public in improving the health ofthe public; 7.4 establish an evidence base for integrated health and for individual complementary modalities; 7.5 promote, foster and advance an integrated approach to health and care; 7.6 raise public, professional and political awareness and cultivate a sentiment in favour of an integrated approach to health and care by publishing and distributing books, pamphlets, reports, leaflets, journals, films, tapes and instructional matter on any media; and so on, for 36 paragraphs. Already in paragraph 4 to 6 we see their interest is to promote \"integrated health\" and \"complementary modalities. These of course are just what most of the rest of the world calls quackery. The objects don't differ greatly from the Prince's Foundation from which this outfit sprang. What will be taught at the College? Some information about the preliminary plans can be gleaned from a letter that describes the new College ( [download the letter](http://www.dcscience.net/College_of_Medicine.pdf)). The letter says \"The College is developing two groups of courses. The first is aimed at registered professionals such as doctors, nurses and physiotherapists. It will familiarise them with different aspects of CAM and develop skills they can use in their day to day practice - not least techniques they can pass on to patients to help them manage their own conditions.\" In other words, the only course for doctors will be to teach them about quackery. Final judgement on that must await information about who will teach it. \"The second group of courses is aimed at non-registered practitioners and will focus on developing their understanding of conventional medicine, including 'red flag' symptoms, familiarisation with conventional therapeutics and increased awareness of critical appraisal.\" The other course, it seems, will be for quacks, to try to teach them enough real medicine to prevent them from killing too many people. The bit about teaching them about \"critical appraisal\" is hard to believe. If that were really done the clients would mostly be out of business. If you were in any doubt at all about the aims of the College, it is necessary only to look at the four directors of the Company Directors of the College of Medicine. - Dr Michael Dixon, general practitioner. Michael Dixon was Medical Director of the Prince's Foundation until it closed down. - Professor George Lewith, is Professor of Health Research in the Complementary Medicine Research Unit, University of Southampton. He was a Foundation Fellow of the Prince's Foundation until it closed down. - Professor David Peters. is Professor of Integrated Healthcare and Clinical Director at the University of Westminster's School of Integrated Health. He was a Foundation Fellow of the Prince's Foundation until it closed down. - Mrs Christine Glover is a pharmacist who [sells homeopathic pills](http://www.glovers-health.co.uk/range.html). She was a Foundation Fellow of the Prince's Foundation until it closed down. The company secretary is named as Linda Leung, who was Operations Director of the Prince's Foundation until it closed. A request to Michael Dixon for information was deflected to Mrs Pat Goodall She is yet another connection with PFIH. Mrs Goodall acted as a spokesperson for the Prince's Foundation until it closed down. Now she is scheduled to become Director of Policy and Communications for the \"College of Medicine\". Mrs Goodall declined to say where the money came from. But she did say that the College was not the \"equivalent of a further education college,. . . or higher education college\", That being the case, it seems very odd to use the name \"College of Medicine\". It is a downright misleading name. These people are all well know advocates of alternative medicine, It is very obvious that the \"College of Medicine\", despite its misleadingly innocuous name, is simply a reincarnation of the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health. The term \"integrated\" is, of course, simply [a euphemism for alternative medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1466). That means those forms of medicine for which there is little or no evidence that they work. When evidence that something works is found, it is called simply medicine. It may be useful to give a bit more information about the Directors. Dr Michael Dixon OBE Michael Dixon is devoted to just about every form of alternative medicine. As well as being medical director of the Prince's Foundation he also runs the NHS Alliance. Despite its name, the NHS Alliance is nothing to do with the NHS and acts, among other things, as an advocate of alternative medicine on the NHS, about which it [has published a lot](http://www.nhsalliance.org/documents.asp?display=docs&themeid=8). Dr Dixon is also a GP at [College Surgery](http://www.collegesurgery.org.uk/index.asp), Cullompton, Devon, where his \"integrated practice\" includes [dozens of alternative practitioners](http://www.collegesurgery.org.uk/ComplementaryTherapy_Practitioners.asp). They include not only disproven things like homeopathy and [acupuncture](http://dcscience.net/?p=945), but also even more bizarre practitioners in ' [Thought Field Therapy](http://www.csicop.org/si/2000-07/thought-field-therapy.html)' and ' [Frequencies of Brilliance](http://www.frequenciesofbrilliance.us/index.html)'. To take only one of these, 'Frequencies of Brilliance' is bizarre beyond belief. One need only quote its founder and chief salesperson. \"Frequencies of Brilliance is a unique energy healing technique that involves the activation of energetic doorways on both the front and back of the body.\" \"These doorways are opened through a series of light touches. This activation introduces high-level Frequencies into the emotional and physical bodies. It works within all the cells and with the entire nervous system which activates new areas of the brain.\" \"Frequencies of Brilliance is a 4th /5th dimensional work. The process is that of activating doorways by lightly touching the body or working just above the body.\" \"Each doorway holds the highest aspect of the human being and is complete in itself. This means that there is a perfect potential to be accessed and activated throughout the doorways in the body.\" Best of all, it can all be [done at a distance ](http://www.frequenciesofbrilliance.us/longdistancework.html)(that must help sales a lot). One is reminded of the Skills for Health \"competence\" in distant healing (inserted on a government web site at the behest (you guessed it) of the Prince's Foundation, [as related here](http://dcscience.net/?p=215#sfh)) \"The intent of a long distance Frequencies of Brilliance (FOB) session is to enable a practitioner to facilitate a session in one geographical location while the client is in another. A practitioner of FOB that has successfully completed a Stage 5 Frequency workshop has the ability to create and hold a stable energetic space in order to work with a person that is not physically present in the same room. The space that is consciously created in the Frequencies of Brilliance work is known as the \"Gap\". It is a space of nonlinear time. It contains \"no time and no space\" or respectively \"all time and all space\". Within this \"Gap\" a clear transfer of the energies takes place and is transmitted to an individual at a time and location consciously intended. Since this dimensional space is in non-linear time the work can be performed and sent backward or forward in time as well as to any location. The Frequencies of Brilliance work cuts through the limitations of our physical existence and allows us to experience ourselves in other dimensional spaces. Therefore people living in other geographic locations than a practitioner have an opportunity to receive and experience the work. The awareness of this dimensional space is spoken about in many indigenous traditions, meditation practices, and in the world of quantum physics. It is referred to by other names such as the void, or vacuum space, etc.\" This is, of course, preposterous gobbledygook. It, and other things in Dr Dixon's [treatment guide](http://www.collegesurgery.org.uk/ComplementaryTherapy_Treatment.asp), seem to be very curious things to impose on patients in the 21st century. You can read more about Michael Dixon at Dr Aust's blog ( [Dr Michael Dixon is annoyed](http://draust.wordpress.com/2010/03/10/dr-michael-dixon-is-annoyed/)), and, from the USA, Steven Novella's analysis in [Dr. Michael Dixon - \"A Pyromaniac In a Field of (Integrative) Straw Men\"](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=450) Professor George Lewith, George Lewith [has appeared quite often](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22George+Lewith%22) in this blog. He first came to my attention when I [discovered in 2006](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=131) that his private clinic was offering a well-known form of fraudulent allergy diagnosis, the Vega test, despite the fact that Lewith himself had written a paper that said it didn't work. Lewith is particularly keen on acupuncture and that most discredited form of quackery, homeopathy. [On More 4 News](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1542#lewith), he actually claimed that there was no good sham form of acupuncture. That is simply not true: great ingenuity has gone into devising controls for acupuncture trials and 'real' acupuncture always comes out the same as sham. Professor David Peters David Peters comes from the University of Westminster, which is famous for offering more degrees than any other in [anti-scientific nonsense](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=19). Westminster is home of the quite remarkable teaching that \" [Amethysts emit high Yin energy](#)\". dowsing, aura photography and other such fairground frauds. Westminster offers also a \"BSc degree\" in that quite remarkable branch of make-believe known as naturopathy, This [teaches students](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1812) about a totally insane form of psycho-babble called [Emo-trance](http://emotrance.com/) and they are taught (no. seriously) about diagnosis with dowsing and pendulums Westminster also teaches [about kinesiology](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1812). Sounds sort of sciencey, but [Applied Kinesiology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_kinesiology) is actually a fraudulent and totally ineffective diagnostic method invented by (you guessed) a chiropractor. It has been widely used by alternative medicine to misdiagnose food allergies. It does not work (Garrow, 1988: [download reprint](http://www.dcscience.net/garrow-kinesiology-bmj-1988.pdf)). Westminster offers [\"BSc degrees\" in Chinese Medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2043) that are a menace to public health. Their unfortunate students are told \"Legally, you cannot claim to cure cancer. This is not a problem because we treat people not diseases\". It is hard to imagine anything more irresponsible, David Peters, as Clinical Director at Westminster must bear responsibility for this load of irresponsible make-believe, I have no doubt that he is well-intentioned but some of the stuff on these courses is a serious danger to public health. Mrs Christine Glover Mrs Glover is an [Edinburgh pharmacist](http://www.glovers-health.co.uk/). She claims She believes symptoms rarely occur in isolation but are usually linked to a persons circumstancs [sic]. Illness occurs when there are imbalances in any of the physical, emotional and spiritual aspects of their life. Well, yes and no, Would you really go to her if you had cancer, or tuberculosis, or even atrial flutter? Judging by her website, what you'd get is a bottle of her Liquid Iron & Vitamin Formula (for \u00a316.25 !). Or any one of a [range of homeopathic pills](http://www.glovers-health.co.uk/range.html). There is no branch of alternative medicine that is more totally discredited than homeopathy. Yet now it i being proposed to form a College of Medicine with four directors who are all part of the dwindling band that insists you can do magic with pills that contain no medicine. Who else supports the College? There are some pretty surprising people who are listed in [the letter](http://www.dcscience.net/College_of_Medicine.pdf) as supporting the College of Medicine, though it remains to be seen how many are left once the true nature of the College is known. Some of the supporters were already Foundation Fellows of the Prince's Foundation, despite having no obvious sympathy with quackery. These include Professor Sir Cyril Chantler, Professor Adrian Eddleston and Professor Simon Gibbons. They also include [the notorious Karol Sikora](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=Karol+Sikora), and the geochemist Professor Jane Plant. Professor Jane Plant is, apparently, a distinguished geochemist, but she developed an obsession with dairy-free diets, after her own experiences with breast cancer. She has written a lot of books and, no doubt, made a lot of money from the desperate. An [extracr from one of her books](http://members.multimania.co.uk/AllThingsChildren/MilkCancer.htm) is titled \"Why I believe that giving up milk is the key to beating breast cancer\". If you want to see the 'evidence' for some of her wild claims, [her web site](http://www.cancersupportinternational.com/janeplant.com/index.asp) invites to join -at a cost of \u00a330. To get a bit closer to the truth it is only necessary to quote the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) Report on diet and cancer, ' [Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity, and the Prevention of Cancer: a Global Perspective](http://www.dcscience.net/WCRF-Marmot-Report.pdf)'. The WCRF is inclined, in my view, to exaggerate the strength of the evidence for a causal link between diet and cancer (see [Diet and health. What can you believe: or does bacon kill you?](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1435)) but nevertheless their assessment of dairy products is very different from Plant's. \"The strongest evidence, corresponding to judgements of 'convincing' and 'probable', shows that milk probably protects against colorectal cancer, and that diets high in calcium are a probable cause of prostate cancer.\" It seems that Jane Plant's claims are thoroughly irresponsible. I'm told that two people who were also Foundation Fellows, and who were originally listed as supporters of the College seem to have already jumped ship, namely Professor Stephen Holgate and Baroness Finlay. Professor Sir Graeme Catto is to be president, and I'm told, Professor Sir Ian Kennedy has agreed to be vice president. It is incomprehensible to me why people like this should be willing to lend their names to the Prince's Foundation in the first place, or to its replacement now.. Other people listed as supporters include Sir Donald Irvine, Professor John Cox, and, on the \"scientific advisory committee, Professor Mustafa Djamgoz and Professor Ajit Lalvani. None of these people has an obvious belief in quackery. sp what are they doing mixed up with a venture like this? Graeme Catto tells me he \"knows very little about CAM\", and Cyril Chantler says the College should deal with evidence-based integrated medicine \"but not alternative medicine or homeopathy\". Since, during his time as a Foundation Fellow of the Prince's Foundation, Cyril Chantler failed totally to shake the advocacy of homeopathy by them, it seems unlikely yhat he'll be any more successful with the College. The only member of the \"scientific advisory committee\" who has answered by invitation to comment on a draft of this post is Professor Mustafa Djamgoz. It seems that he is more gullible that meets the eye He said, for example, \"There are many 'eastern' remedies (such as acupuncture that we witnessed dismissed 25 year ago) that work.\" \"We ourselves have already shown that natural substances like omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, reseveratrol [sic] etc can produce anti-cancer effects by blocking ion channels.\" Clearly Professor Djamgoz has not been keeping up with research in these areas. Has he never read Barker Bausell's book on acupuncture, [Snake Oil Science](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=239#bausell).? Apparently not. And there is, of course, not the slightest reason to think that omega-3 or resveratrol help cancer in humans. It is often said that the reason that eminent people support quackery is that they live in hopes of a peerage. That is, perhaps, a bit uncharitable. I think it more likely that they don't bother to investigate closely what it is they are signing up to, and that they are fooled by the [weasel words of \"integrated medicine\"](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1466). People like Catto and Chantler seem to think they are supporting caring, human centred, medicine. I fear they have been fooled, They are supporting sheer quackery. Patient centred medicine One of the most infuriating characteristics of quacks is their attempt to hi-jack the 'human side of medicine'. I suppose they have little else to offer, so it's understandable. But there is nothing human about deceiving desperate patients and the human side of medicine is something that is emphasised in the education of every real doctor. If you want to know more about it, there is no better exposition than [Michael Baum's Samuel Gee lecture](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3095#baum). Baum has been at the forefront of thinking about supportive or spiritual care of cancer patients. His 2009 Samuel Gee lecture is available in video, [Concepts of Holism in Orthodox and Alternative Medicine](https://admin.emea.acrobat.com/_a45839050/p69282078/). It is a masterpiece. He ends the lecture thus. \"Alternative versions of \"holistic medicine\" that offer claims of miracle cures for cancer by impossible dietary regimens, homeopathy or metaphysical manipulation of non-existent energy fields, are cruel and fraudulent acts that deserve to be criminalized.\" A similar distinction has been made with beautiful clarity by [Dr James May](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3095) \"The use of the term 'integrative medicine' in your editorial seems to confuse more than clarify the problem of 'holism' in medicine. Complementary therapists for example often use the term 'holistic' to blur the boundaries between the therapies used and the practitioner's interpersonal skills. It would be better, however, to keep these distinctions clear. Caring is different from curing.\" \"'Holism' is not a multifaceted approach to curing, it is a multifaceted approach to caring\" \"Effective medicine is best measured with RCTs. Caring is not. 'Integrative medicine' therefore risks both damaging how we measure effective medicines (RCTs), as well as reducing caring to measurables. A better term for this might be 'disintegrative medicine'.Effective medicine is best measured with RCTs. Caring is not. 'Integrative medicine' therefore risks both damaging how we measure effective medicines (RCTs), as well as reducing caring to measurables. A better term for this might be 'disintegrative medicine'.\" I hope that the various eminent people who have lent their name to this mis-named 'College of Medicine' will look very carefully at what it actually does. And that will probably mean withdrawing their support. Follow-up The Guardian, 2nd August 2010, carried this story, written by their science correspondent, Ian Sample: [College of Medicine born from ashes of Prince Charles's holistic health charity](http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/aug/02/prince-charles-college-medicine-holistic-complementary). He quotes Tracey Brown of the Sense about Science charity as saying that the college's emphasis on merging conventional medicine with unproven complementary therapies \"would take society back a century\". \"Despite its mission to promote the integration of alternatives to medicine, this new body has chosen to call itself very grandly the College of Medicine. Perhaps someone thinks this will sound good with Royal in front of it? This wouldn't be a surprise given the institution's origins in the Prince of Wales's efforts to integrate his favoured traditional remedies into medicine.\" Quotation from DC The King's Fund recently published [Assessing complementary practice Building consensus on appropriate research methods](http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/document.rm?id=8425) [or [download pdf](/assessing_complementary_practice.pdf)]. It is described as being the \"Report of an independent advisory group\". I guess everyone knows by now that an \"expert report\" can be produced to back any view whatsoever simply by choosing the right \"experts\", so the first things one does is to see who wrote it. Here they are. - Chair: Professor Dame Carol Black - Harry Cayton, Chief Executive, Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence - Professor Adrian Eddleston, then Vice-Chairman, The King's Fund - Professor George Lewith, Professor of Health Research, Complementary and Integrated Medicine Research Unit, University of Southampton - Professor Stephen Holgate, MRC Clinical Professor of Immunopharmacology, University of Southampton - Professor Richard Lilford, Head of School of Health and Population Sciences, University of Birmingham We see at once two of the best known apologists for alternative medicine, George Lewith (who has [appeared here](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=lewith) more than once) and Stephen Holgate. Harry Cayton is CEO of Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence (CHRE) which must be one of the most useless box-ticking quangos in existence. It was the CHRE that praised the General Chiropractic Council (GCC) for the quality of its work. That is the same GCC that is at present trying to cope with 600 or so complaints about the people it is supposed to regulate (not to mention a vast number of complaints to Trading Standards Offices). The GCC must be the prime example of the folly of giving government endorsement to things that don't work. But the CHRE were not smart enough to spot that little problem. No doubt Mr Cayton did good work for the Alzheimer's Society. His advocacy of patient's choice may have helped me personally. But it isn't obvious to me that he is the least qualified to express an opinion on research methods in anything whatsoever. According to [the Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2003/dec/10/guardiansocietysupplement.politics) he is \"BA in English and linguistics from the University of Ulster; diploma in anthropology from the University of Durham; B Phil in philosophy of education from the University of Newcastle.\" Adrian Eddlestone is a [retired Professor of Medicine](http://www.zoominfo.com/people/Eddleston_Adrian_408544754.aspx). He has been in academic administration since 1983. His sympathy for alternative medicine is demonstrated by the fact that he is also Chair of the General Osteopathic Council, yet another \"regulator\" that has done nothing to protect the public from false health claims (and which may, soon, find itself in the same sort of trouble as the GCC). Richard Lilford is the only member of the group who has no bias towards alternative medicine and also the only member with expertise in clinical research methods His [credentials](http://www.hddt.bham.ac.uk/lilford.htm) look impressive, and his publications show how he is the ideal person for this job. I rather liked also his article [Stop meddling and let us get on](http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2002/jan/27/NHS.health1).. He [has written](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Lilford+RJ+postmodern&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&client=firefox-a) about the harm done by postmodernism and relativism, the [fellow-travellers of alternative medicine](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=36). Most damning of all, Lewith, Eddlestone and Holgate (along with Cyril Chantler, chair of the King's Fund, and homeopaths, spiritual healers and Karol Sikora) are [Foundation Fellows of the Prince of Wales Foundation for Magic Medicine](http://www.fih.org.uk/about_us/foundation_fellows.html), an organisation that is at the forefront of [spreading medical misinformation](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=FIH). I shall refer here to 'alternative medicine' rather than 'complementary medicine' which is used in the report. It is not right to refer to a treatment as 'complementary' until such time as it has been shown to work. The term 'complementary' is a euphemism that, like [ 'integrative'](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1466), is standard among alternative medicine advocates whose greatest wish is to gain respectability. The Report The recommendations On page 10 we find a summary of the conclusions. The report identifies five areas of consensus, which together set a framework for moving forward. These are: - the primary importance of controlled trials to assess clinical and cost effectiveness. - the importance of understanding how an intervention works - the value of placebo or non-specific effects - the need for investment and collaboration in creating a sound evidence base - the potential for whole-system evaluation to guide decision-making and subsequent research. The first recommendation is just great. The rest sound to me like the usual excuses for incorporating ineffective treatments into medical practice. Notice the implicit assumption in the fourth point that spending money on research will establish \"a sound evidence base\". There is a precedent, but it is ignored. A huge omission from the report is that it fails to mention anywhere that a lot of research has already been done. Much research has already been done (and failed) The report fails to mention at all the single most important fact in this area. The US National Institutes of Health has spent over a billion dollars on research on alternative medicines, over a period of more than 10 years. It has failed to come up with any effective treatments whatsoever. See, for example [Why the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) Should Be Defunded](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/nccam.html); [Should there be more alternative research?](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=202); [Integrative baloney @ Yale](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=231), and most recently, [$2.5B Spent, No Alternative Med Cures found. ](http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=7804031). Why did the committee think this irrelevant? I can't imagine. You guess. The report says \"This report outlines areas of potential consensus to guide research funders, researchers, commissioners and complementary practitioners in developing and applying a robust evidence base for complementary practice.\" As happens so often, there is implicit in this sentence the assumption that if you spend enough money evidence will emerge. That is precisely contrary to the experence in the USA where spending a billion dollars produced nothing beyond showing that a lot of things we already thought didn't work were indeed ineffective. And inevitably, and tragically, [ NICE's biggest mistake](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1593) is invoked. \"It is noteworthy that the evidence is now sufficiently robust for NICE to include acupuncture as a treatment for low back pain.\" [p ] Did the advisory group not read the evidence used (and misinterpeted) by NICE? It seems not. Did the advisory group not read the outcome of NIH-funded studies on acupuncture as summarised by Barker Bausell in his book, [Snake Oil Science?](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=239#bausell) Apparently not. It's hard to know because the report has no references. George Lewith is quoted [p. 15] as saying \"to starve the system of more knowledge means we will continue to make bad decisions\". No doubt he'd like more money for research, but if a billion dollars in the USA gets no useful result, is Lewith really likely to do better? The usual weasel words of the alternative medicine industry are there in abundance \"First, complementary practice often encompasses an intervention (physical treatment or manipulation) as well as the context for that intervention. Context in this setting means both the physical setting for the delivery of care and the therapeutic relationship between practitioner and patient.\" [p. 12] Yes, but ALL medicine involves the context of the treatment. This is no different whether the medicine is alternative or real. The context (or placebo) effect comes as an extra bonus with any sort of treatment. \"We need to acknowledge that much of complementary practice seeks to integrate the positive aspects of placebo and that it needs to be viewed as an integral part of the treatment rather than an aspect that should be isolated and discounted.\" [p. 13] This is interesting. It comes very close (here and elsewhere) to admitting that all you get is a placebo effect, and that this doesn't matter. This contradicts directly the first [ recommendation of the House of Lords report (2000)](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=199).. Both the [House of Lords report](http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199900/ldselect/ldsctech/123/12301.htm) on Complementary and Alternative Medicine, and the [Government's response](http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm51/5124/5124.pdf) to it, state clearly \". . . we recommend that three important questions should be addressed in the following order\". (1) does the treatment offer therapeutic benefits greater than placebo? (2) is the treatment safe? (3) how does it compare, in medical outcome and cost-effectiveness, with other forms of treatment?. The crunch comes when the report gets to what we should pay for. \"Should we be prepared to pay for the so-called placebo effect? The view of the advisory group is that it is appropriate to pay for true placebo (rather than regression to the mean or temporal effects).\" [p 24] Perhaps so, but there is very little discussion of the emormous ethical questions:that this opinion raises: - How much is one allowed to lie to patients in order to elicit a placebo effect? - Is is OK if the practitioner believes it is a placebo but gives it anyway? - Is it OK if the pratitioner believes that it is not a placebo when actually it is? - Is it OK for practitioners to go degrees taught by people who believe that it is not a placebo when actually it is? The report fails to face frankly these dilemmas. The present rather absurd position in which it is considered unethical for a medical practitioner to give a patient a bottle of pink water, but perfectly acceptable to refer them to a homeopath. There is no sign either of taking into account the cultural poison that is spread by telling people about yin, yang and meridians and such like preposterous made-up mumbo jumbo. That is part of the cost of endorsing placebos. And just when one thought that believing things because you wished they were true was going out of fashion Once again we hear a lot about the alleged difficulties posed by research on alternative medicine. These alleged difficulties are, in my view, mostly no more than excuses. There isn't the slightest difficulty in testing things like herbal medicine or homeopathy, in a way that preserves all the 'context' and the ways of working of homeopaths and herbalists. Anyone who reads [the Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2007/nov/16/sciencenews.g2) knows how to do that. In the [case of acupuncture](#), great ingenuity has gone into divising controls. The sham and the 'real' acupuncture always come out the same. In a non-blind comparison between acupuncture and no acupuncture the latter usually does a bit worse, but the effects are small and transient and entirely compatible with the view that it is a theatrical placebo. Despite these shortcomings, some of the conclusions [p. 22] are reasonable. \"The public needs more robust evidence to make informed decisions about the use of complementary practice. Commissioners of public health care need more robust evidence on which to base decisions about expenditure of public money on complementary practice.\" What the report fails to do is to follow this with the obvious conclusion that such evidence is largely missing and that until such time as it is forthcoming there should be no question of the NHS paying for alternative treatments. Neither should there be any question of giving them [official government recognition](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2007) in the form of 'statutory regulation'. The folly of doing that is illustrated graphically by [the case of chiropractic](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1775) which is now in deep crisis after inspection of its claims in the wake of the Simon Singh defamation case. Osteopathy will, I expect, suffer the same fate soon. In the summary on p.12 we see a classical case of the tension Controlled trials of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness are of primary importance We recognise that it is the assessment of effectiveness that is of primary importance in reaching a judgement of different practices. Producing robust evidence that something works in practice - that it is effective - should not be held up by the inevitably partial findings and challenged interpretations arising from inquiries into how the intervention works. The headline sounds impeccable, but directly below it we see a clear statement that we should use treatments before we know whether they work. \"Effectiveness\", in the jargon of the alternative medicine business, simply means that uncontrolled trials are good enough. The bit about \"how it works\" is another very common red herring raised by alternative medicine people. Anyone who knows anything about pharmacology that knowledge about how any drug works is incomplete and often turns out to be wrong. That doesn't matter a damn if it performs well in good double-blind randomised controlled trials. One gets the impression that the whole thing would have been a lot worse without the dose of reality injected by Richard Lilford. He is quoted as a saying \"All the problems that you find in complementary medicine you will encounter in some other kind of treatment ... when we stop and think about it... how different is it to any branch of health care - the answer to emerge from our debates is that it may only be a matter of degree.\" [p. 17] I take that to mean that alternative medicine poses problems that are no different from other sorts of treatment. They should be subjected to exactly the same criteria. If they fail (as is usually the case) they should be rejected. That is exactly right. The report was intended to produce consensus, but throughout the report, there is a scarcely hidden tension between believers on one side, and Richard Lilford's impeccable logic on the other. Who are the King's Fund? The [King's Fund](http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/) is an organisation that [states its aims](http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/document.rm?id=7710) thus. \"The King's Fund creates and develops ideas that help shape policy, transform services and bring about behaviour change which improve health care.\" It bills this report on its home page as \"New research methods needed to build evidence for the effectiveness of popular complementary therapies\". But in fact the report doesn't really recommend 'new research methods' at all, just that the treatments pass the same tests as any other treatment. And note the term 'build evidence'. It carries the suggestion that the evidence will be positive. Experience in the USA (and to a smaller extent in the UK) suggests that every time some good research is done, the effect is not to 'build evidence' but for the evidence to crumble further If the advice is followed, and the results are largely negative, as has already happened in the USA, the Department of Health would look pretty silly if it had insisted on degrees and on statutory regulation. The King's Fund chairman is Sir Cyril Chantler and its Chief Executive is Niall Dickson. It produces reports, some of which are better than this one. I know it's hard to take seriously an organisation that wants to \"share its vision\" withyou, but they are trying. \"The King's Fund was formed in 1897 as an initiative of the then Prince of Wales to allow for the collection and distribution of funds in support of the hospitals of London. Its initial purpose was to raise money for London's voluntary hospitals,\" It seems to me that the King's Fund is far too much too influenced by the present Prince of Wales. He is, no doubt, well-meaning but he has become a major source of medical misinformation and his influence in the Department of Health is deeply unconstitutional. I was really surprised to see thet Cyril Chantler spoke at the [2009 conference of the Prince of Wales Foundation](http://www.fih.org.uk/information_library/conference_material_2009/) for Integrated Health, despite having a preview of the sort of make-believe being propagated by other speakers. [His talk there](http://www.fih.org.uk/information_library/conference_material_2009/conference_blogs/chronic_stress_is_a.html) struck me as evading all the essential points. Warm, woolly but in the end, a danger to patients. Not only did he uncritically fall for the spin on the word \"integrated\", but he also fell for the idea that \"statutory regulation\" will safeguard patients. Revelation of [what is actually taught](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2043) on degrees in these subjects shows very clearly that they endanger the public. But the official mind doesn't seem ever to look that far. It is happy ticking boxes and writing vacuous managerialese. It lacks curiosity. Follow-up The British Medical Journal published today [an editorial](http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/339/sep01_2/b3335) which also recommends rebranding of 'pragmatic' trials. No surprise there, because the editorial is written by Hugh MacPherson, senior research fellow, David Peters, professor of integrated healthcare and Catherine Zollman, general practitioner. I find it a liitle odd that the BMJ says \"Competing Interests: none. David Peters interest is obvious from his job description. It is less obvious that [Hugh MacPherson](https://hsciweb.york.ac.uk/research/public/Staff.aspx?ID=926) is an acupuncture enthusiast who publishes mostly in alternative medicine journals. He has written a book with the extraordinary title \"Acupuncture Research, Strategies for Establishing an Evidence Base\". The title seems to assume that the evidence base will materialise eventually despite a great deal of work that suggests it won't. Catherine Zollman is a GP who is into homeopathy as well as acupuncture. All three authors were speakers at the Prince of Wales conference, described at [Prince of Wales Foundation for magic medicine: spin on the meaning of 'integrated'](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1466#zoll). The comments that follow the editorial start with an excellent contribution from [James Matthew May](http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/339/sep01_2/b3335#219657). His distinction between 'caring' and 'curing' clarifies beautifully the muddled thinking of the editorial. Then a comment from DC, [If your treatments can't pass the test, the test must be wrong](http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/339/sep01_2/b3335#219673). It concludes \"At some point a stop has to be put to this continual special pleading. The financial crisis (caused by a quite different group of people who were equally prone to wishful thinking) seems quite a good time to start.\" |The Prince of Wales' Foundation for Integrated Health ( | His attempts are often successful, but they are regarded by many people as being clearly unconstitutional. The FiH's [2009 AnnualConferen ce ](http://www.fih2009.co.uk/) conference was held at The King's Fund, London 13 - 14 May 2009. It was, as always, an almost totally one-sided affair devoted to misrepresentation of evidence and the promotion of magic medicine. But according to the FiH, at least, it was [a great success](http://www.fih.org.uk/what_we_do/integrated_health_awards/integrated_health_awards_2008/success_of_our_2009.html). The opening speech by the Quacktitioner Royal [can be read here](http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/speechesandarticles/a_speech_by_hrh_the_prince_of_wales_for_the_prince_s_foundat_1928839521.html). It has already been [analysed by somebody who knows rather more about medicine than HRH](http://northerndoctor.com/2009/05/13/a-royal-fisking-prince-charles-on-integrated-health/). He concludes \"It is a shocking perversion of the real issues driven by one man; unelected, unqualified and utterly misguided\". We are promised some movie clips of the meeting. They might even make a nice UK equivalent of \" [Integrative baloney @ Yale](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2WF8ovmyfg)\". This post is intended to provide some background information about the speakers at the symposium. But let's start with what seems to me to be the real problem. The duplicitous use of the word \"integrated\" to mean two quite different things. The problem of euphemisms: spin and obfuscation One of the problems of meetings like this is the harm done by use of euphemisms. After looking at the programme, it becomes obvious that there is a rather ingenious bit of PR trickery going on. It confuses (purposely?) the many different definitions of the word \"integrative\" [. One definition of \"Integrative medicine](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/139304.php)\" is this (my emphasis). \" . . . orienting the health care process to engage patients and caregivers in the full range of physical, psychological, social, preventive, and therapeutic factors known to be effective and necessary for the achievement of optimal health.\" That is a thoroughly admirable aim. And that, I imagine, is the sense in which several of the speakers (Marmot, Chantler etc) used the term. Of course the definition is rather too vague to be very helpful in practice, but nobody would dream of objecting to it. But another definition of the same term 'integrative medicine' is as a PR-friendly synonym for 'alternative medicine', and that is clearly the sense in which it is used by the Prince of Wales' Foundation for Integrated Health (FIH), as is immediately obvious from [ their web site](http://www.fih.org.uk/). The [guide to the main therapies ](http://www.fih.org.uk/information_library/complementary_healthcare_a_guide/guide_to_the_main.html)supports everything from homeopathy to chiropractic to naturopathy, in a totally uncritical way. Integrated service refers explicitly to integration of 'complementary' medicine, and that itself is largely a euphemism for alternative medicine. For example, the [FIH's guide to homeopathy](http://www.fih.org.uk/information_library/complementary_healthcare_a_guide/overview_of_the_main_complementary_therapies/homeopathy.html) says \"What is homeopathy commonly used for? Homeopathy is most often used to treat chronic conditions such as asthma; eczema; arthritis; fatigue disorders like ME; headache and menopausal problems; irritable bowel syndrome; Crohn's disease; allergies; repeated ear, nose, throat and chest infections or urine infections; depression and anxiety.\" But there is not a word about the evidence, and perhaps that isn't surprising because the evidence that it works in any of these conditions is essentially zero. The FIH document Complementary Health Care: A Guide for Patients appears to have vanished from the web after its inaccuracy received a very bad press, e.g. in [the Times](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/alternative_medicine/article3760857.ece), and also [here](http://dcscience.net/?p=228). It is also interesting that the equally widely criticised Smallwood report (also sponsored by the Prince of Wales) seems to have vanished too). The programme for the meeting can be seen here, for [Day 1](http://www.fih2009.co.uk/programme.htm), and [Day 2 ](http://www.fih2009.co.uk/day2.htm) Conference chair Dr Phil Hammond, GP, comedian and health service writer. Hammond asked the FIH if I could speak at the meeting to provide a bit of balance. Guess what? They didn't want balance. 09:30 Opening session Dr Michael Dixon OBE 09:30 Introduction: a new direction for The Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health and new opportunities in integrated health and care. Dr Michael Dixon, Medical Director, FIH Michael Dixon is devoted to just about every form of alternative medicine. As well as being medical director of the Prince's Foundation he also runs the NHS Alliance. Despite its name, the NHS Alliance is nothing to do with the NHS and acts, among other things, as an advocate of alternative medicine on the NHS, about which it [has published a lot](http://www.nhsalliance.org/documents.asp?display=docs&themeid=8). Dr Dixon is also a GP at [College Surgery](http://www.collegesurgery.org.uk/index.asp), Cullompton, Devon, where his \"integrated practice\" includes [dozens of alternative practitioners](http://www.collegesurgery.org.uk/ComplementaryTherapy_Practitioners.asp). They include not only disproven things like homeopathy and [acupuncture](http://dcscience.net/?p=945), but also even more bizarre practitioners in ' [Thought Field Therapy](http://www.csicop.org/si/2000-07/thought-field-therapy.html)' and ' [Frequencies of Brilliance](http://www.frequenciesofbrilliance.us/index.html)'. To take only one of these, 'Frequencies of Brilliance' is bizarre beyond belief. One need only quote its founder and chief salesperson. \"Frequencies of Brilliance is a unique energy healing technique that involves the activation of energetic doorways on both the front and back of the body.\" \"These doorways are opened through a series of light touches. This activation introduces high-level Frequencies into the emotional and physical bodies. It works within all the cells and with the entire nervous system which activates new areas of the brain.\" \"Frequencies of Brilliance is a 4th /5th dimensional work. The process is that of activating doorways by lightly touching the body or working just above the body.\" \"Each doorway holds the highest aspect of the human being and is complete in itself. This means that there is a perfect potential to be accessed and activated throughout the doorways in the body.\" Best of all, it can all be [done at a distance ](http://www.frequenciesofbrilliance.us/longdistancework.html)(that must help sales a lot). One is reminded of the Skills for Health \"competence\" in distant healing (inserted on a government web site at the behest (you guessed it) of the Prince's Foundation, [as related here](http://dcscience.net/?p=215#sfh)) \"The intent of a long distance Frequencies of Brilliance (FOB) session is to enable a practitioner to facilitate a session in one geographical location while the client is in another. A practitioner of FOB that has successfully completed a Stage 5 Frequency workshop has the ability to create and hold a stable energetic space in order to work with a person that is not physically present in the same room. The space that is consciously created in the Frequencies of Brilliance work is known as the \"Gap\". It is a space of nonlinear time. It contains \"no time and no space\" or respectively \"all time and all space\". Within this \"Gap\" a clear transfer of the energies takes place and is transmitted to an individual at a time and location consciously intended. Since this dimensional space is in non-linear time the work can be performed and sent backward or forward in time as well as to any location. The Frequencies of Brilliance work cuts through the limitations of our physical existence and allows us to experience ourselves in other dimensional spaces. Therefore people living in other geographic locations than a practitioner have an opportunity to receive and experience the work. The awareness of this dimensional space is spoken about in many indigenous traditions, meditation practices, and in the world of quantum physics. It is referred to by other names such as the void, or vacuum space, etc.\" This is, of course, preposterous gobbledygook. It, and other things in Dr Dixon's [treatment guide](http://www.collegesurgery.org.uk/ComplementaryTherapy_Treatment.asp), seem to be very curious things to impose on patients in the 21st century. Latest news. The [Mid-Devon Star announces](http://www.middevonstar.co.uk/news/4198135.Homeopathy_comes_to_Cullompton/) yet more homeopathy in Dr Dixon's Cullompton practice. This time it comes in the form of a clinic run from the Bristol Homeopathic Hospital. I guess they must be suffering from reduced commissioning like all the other homeopathic hospitals, but Dr Dixon seems to have come to their rescue. The connection seems to be with Bristol's homeopathic consultant, Dr Elizabeth A Thompson. On 11 December 2007 I wrote to Dr Thompson, thus | | In March 2006, a press release This was reported also on the BBC I'd be very grateful if you could let me know when results from this trial will become available. Yours sincerely David Colquhoun The reply, dated 11 December 2007, was unsympathetic | | I have just submitted the funders report today and we have set ourselves the deadline to publish two inter-related papers by March 1st 2007. Can I ask why you are asking and what authority you have to gain this information. I shall expect a reply to my questions, I answered this question politely on the same day but nevertheless my innocent enquiry drew forth a rather vitriolic complaint from Dr Thompson to the Provost of UCL (dated 14 December 2007). In this case, the Provost came up trumps. On 14 January 2008 he replied to Thompson: \"I have looked at the email that you copied to me, and I must say that it seems an entirely proper and reasonable request. It is not clear to me why Professor Colquhoun should require some special authority to make such direct enquiries\". Dr Thompson seems to be very sensitive. We have yet to see the results of her trial in which I'm still interested. Not surprisingly, Dr Dixon has had some severe criticism for his views, not least from the UK's foremost expert on the evidence for efficacy, Prof Edzard Ernst. Accounts of this can be found in [Pulse](http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=35&storycode=4121964&c=2), and on [Andrew Lewis's blog](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/02/graceless-dr-michael-dixon-obe.html). Dixon is now (in)famous in the USA too. The excellent Yale neurologist, Steven Novella, has written an analysis of his views on Science Based Medicine. He describes Dr. Michael Dixon as \" [A Pyromaniac In a Field of (Integrative) Straw Men](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=450)\" Peter Hain 09:40 Politics and people: can integrated health and care take centre stage in 2009/2010? Rt Hon Peter Hain MP It seems that Peter Hain was converted to alternative medicine when his first baby, Sam, was born with eczema. After (though possibly not because of) homeopathic treatment and a change in diet, the eczema got better. This caused Hain, while Northern Ireland Secretary to spend \u00a3200,000 of taxpayers' money to set up a totally uninformative customer satisfaction survey, which is being touted elsewhere in this meeting as though it were evidence (see below). I have written about this episode before: see [Peter Hain and Get Well UK: pseudoscience and privatisation in Northern Ireland](http://dcscience.net/?p=33). I find it very sad that a hero of my youth (for his work in the anti-apartheid movement) should have sunk to promoting junk science, and even sadder that he does so at my expense. There has been a report on Hain's contribution in [Wales Online](http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2009/05/15/make-complementary-medicine-free-on-the-nhs-says-hain-91466-23628473/). 09:55 Why does the Health Service need a new perspective on health and healing? Sir Cyril Chantler, Chair, King's Fund, previous Dean, Guy's Hospital and Great Ormond Street Cyril Chantler is a distinguished medical administrator. He also likes to talk and we have discussed the quackery problem several times. He kindly sent me the slides that he used. Slide 18 says that in order to do some good we \"need to demonstrate that the treatment is clinically effective and cost effective for NHS use\". That's impeccable, but throughout the rest of the slides he talks of integrating with complementary\" therapies, the effectiveness of which is either already disproved or simply not known. I remain utterly baffled by the reluctance of some quite sensible people to grasp the nettle of deciding what works. Chantler fails to grasp the nettle, as does the Department of Health. Until they do so, I don't see how they can be taken seriously. 10.05 Panel discussion The Awards 10:20 Integrated Health Awards 2009 Introduction: a review of the short-listed applications 10:45 Presentations to the Award winners by the special guest speaker 11:00 Keynote address by special guest speaker Getting integrated Dr David Peters 12:00 Integration, long term disease and creating a sustainable NHS. Professor David Peters, Clinical Director and Professor of Integrated Healthcare, University of Westminster I first met David Peters after Nature ran my article, [Science Degrees without the Science. ](http://dcscience.net/?p=19).One of the many media follow-ups of that article was on Material World (BBC Radio 4). This [excellent science programme](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/science/thematerialworld.shtml), presented by Quentin Cooper, had a discussion between me and David Peters ( [listen to the mp3 file).](http://dcscience.net/material-world-part2-220307.mp3) There was helpful intervention from Michael Marmot who had talked, in the first half of the programme, about his longitudinal population studies. Marmot stressed the need for proper testing. In the case of homeopathy and [acupuncture](http://dcscience.net/?p=945), that proper testing has largely been done. The tests were failed. The University of Westminster has, of course, gained [considerable notoriety](http://dcscience.net/?s=Westminster+university) as the university that runs more degree programmes in anti-scientific forms of medicine than any other. Their lecture on [vibrational medicine](http://dcscience.net/?p=227) teaches students that [amethysts \"emit high Yin energy so transmuting lower energies and clearing and aligning energy disturbances at all levels of being\"](http://dcscience.net/?p=227#slides). So far their vice-chancellor, Professor Geoffrey Petts, has declined to answer enquiries about whether he thinks such gobbledygook is appropriate for a BSc degree. But he did set up an internal enquiry into the future of their alternative activities. Sadly that enquiry seems to have come to the nonsensical conclusion that the problem can be solved by injection of good science into the courses, as [reported here](http://dcscience.net/?p=1191) and in [the Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2009/feb/24/homeopathy-science). It seems obvious that if you inject good science into their BSc in homeopathy the subject will simply vanish in a puff of smoke. In 2007, the University of Westminster did respond to earlier criticism in [Times Higher Education](http://dcscience.net/thes-060407.pdf), but [their response](http://dcscience.net/?p=83) seemed to me to serve only to dig themselves deeper into a hole. Nevertheless, Westminster has now closed down its homeopathy degree (the last in the country to go) and there is intense internal discussion going on there. I have the impression that Dr Peters' job is in danger. The [revelation of more slides](http://dcscience.net/?p=1329) from their courses on homeopathy, naturopathy and Chinese herbal medicine shows that these courses are not only barmy, but also sometimes dangerous. Professor Chris Fowler 12:10 Educating tomorrow's integrated doctors. Professor Chris Fowler, Dean for Education, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry I first came across Dr Fowler when I noticed him being praised for his teaching of alternative medicine to students at Barts and the London Medical School on the web site of the Prince's Foundation. I wrote him a polite letter to ask if he really thought that the Prince of Wales was the right person to consult about the education of medical students. The response I got was, ahem, unsympathetic. But a little while later I noticed that two different Barts students had set up public blogs that criticised strongly the nonsense that was being inflicted on them. At that point, I felt it was necessary to support the students who, it seemed to me, knew more about medical education than Professor Fowler. It didn't take long to uncover the nonsense that was being inflicted on the students: [read about it here](http://dcscience.net/?p=555). There is a [follow-up to this story here](http://dcscience.net/?p=1143). Fortunately, Barts' Director of Research, and, I'm told, the Warden of Barts, appear to agree with my view of the harm that this sort of thing can do to the reputation of Barts, so things may change soon, Dame Donna Kinnair 12:30 Educating tomorrow's integrated nurses. Dame Donna Kinnair, Director of Nursing, Southwark PCT As far as I can see, Donna Kinnair has no interest in alternative medicine. She is director of nursing at Southwark primary care trust and was an adviser to Lord Laming throughout his inquiry into the death of Victoria Climbi\u00e9. I suspect that her interest is in integrating child care services (they need it, judging by the recent death of 'Baby P'). Perhaps her presence shows the danger of using euphemisms like 'integrated medicine' when what you really mean is the introduction of unproven or disproved forms of medicine. Michael Dooley 12:40 Integrating the care of women: an example of the new paradigm. Michael Dooley, Consultant Obstetrician and Gynecologist DC's rule 2. Never trust anyone who uses the word 'paradigm'. It is a sure-fire sign of pseudoscience. In this case, the 'new paradigm' seems to be the introduction of disproven treatment. Dooley is a gynaecologist and Medical Director of the [ Poundbury Clinic](http://www.thepoundburyclinic.com/). His clinic offers a [whole range of unproven](http://www.thepoundburyclinic.com/treatments.htm) and disproved treatments. These include acupuncture as an aid to conception in IVF. This is not recommended by the [ Cochrane review](http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab006920.html), and one report suggests that it [hinders conception rather than helps](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2007/oct/17/medicalresearch). 12.40 Discussion 13.00 - 14.00 Lunch and Exhibition 15.30 Tea Boo Armstrong and Get Well UK 16.00 Integrated services in action: The Northern Ireland experience: what has it shown us and what are its implications? Boo Armstrong of Get Well UK with a team from the NI study I expect that much will be made of this \"study\", which, of course, tells you absolutely nothing whatsoever about the effectiveness of the alternative treatments that were used in it. This does not appear to be the view of Boo Armstrong, On the basis of the \"study\", her [company's web site](http://www.getwelluk.com/) proclaims boldly \"Complementary Medicine Works Get Well UK ran the first government-backed complementary therapy project in the UK, from February 2007 to February 2008 This claim appears, prima facie, to breach the [Unfair Trading Regulations](http://dcscience.net/?p=790) of May 2008. The legality of the claim is, at the moment, being judged by a Trading Standards Officer. In any case, the \"study\" was not backed by the government as a whole, but just by Peter Hain's office. It is not even clear that it had ethical approval. The study consisted merely of asking people who had seen an alternative medicine practitioner whether they felt better or worse. There was no control group; no sort of comparison was made. It is surely obvious to the most naive person that a study like this cannot even tell you if the treatment has a placebo effect, never mind that it has any genuine effects of its own. To claim that it does so seems to be simply dishonest. There is no reason at all to think that the patients would not have got better anyway. It is not only Get Well UK who misrepresent the evidence. The [Prince's Foundation itself ](http://www.fih.org.uk/media_centre/sense_at_last.html)says \"Now a new, year long trial supported by the Northern Ireland health service has . . . demonstrated that integrating complementary and conventional medicine brings measurable benefits to patients' health.\" That is simply not true. It is either dishonest or stupid. Don't ask me which, I have no idea. This study is no more informative than the [infamous Spence (2005) 'study'](http://dcscience.net/?p=198) of the same type, which seems to be the only thing that homeopaths can produce to support their case. There is an excellent analysis of the Northern Ireland 'study' by Andy Lewis, [The Northern Ireland NHS Alternative Medicine 'Trial'](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/02/northern-ireland-nhs-alternative.html). He explains patiently, yet again, what constitutes evidence and why studies like this are useless. His analogy starts \" . . . the Apple Marketing Board approach the NHS and ask for \u00a3200,000 to do a study to show the truth behind the statement 'An apple a day keeps the doctor away'. The Minister, being particularly fond of apples, agrees and the study begins.\" 16.30 Social enterprise and whole systems integrated care. Dee Kyne, Sandwell PCT and a GP.

Peter Mackereth, Clinical Lead, Supportive Services, Christie Hospital NHS Foundation Trust I had some correspondence with Mackereth when the Times (7 Feb 2007) published a picture of the Prince of Wales inspecting an \"anti-MRSA aromatherapy inhaler\" in his department at the Christie. It turned out that the trial they were doing was not blind No result has been announced anyway, and on enquiry, I find that the trial has not even started yet. Surprising, then to find that the FIH is running the [First Clinical Aromatherapy Conference at the Christie Hospital](http://www.fih.org.uk/events/events_from_other_organisations/1st_clinical.html), What will there be to talk about? Much of what they do at the Christie is straightforward massage, but [they also promote](http://www.christie.nhs.uk/press/2007/070207.aspx) the nonsensical principles of \"reflexology\" and acupuncture. The former is untested. The latter [is disproven](http://dcscience.net/?p=945). Parallel Sessions Developing a PCT funded musculoskeletal service Dr Roy Welford, Glastonbury Health Centre [Roy Welford is a Fellow](http://www.glastonburyhealthcentre.co.uk/comptherapy.html) of the Faculty of Homeopathy, and so promotes disproven therapies. The [Glastonbury practice](http://www.glastonburyhealthcentre.co.uk/comptherapy.html) also advertises acupuncture ( [disproven](http://dcscience.net/?p=945)), osteopathy and herbal medicine (largely untested so most of it consists of giving patients an unknown dose of an ill-defined drug, of unknown effectiveness and unknown safety). Making the best of herbal self-prescription in integrated practice: key remedies and principles. Simon Mills, Project Lead: Integrated Self Care in Family Practice, Culm Valley Integrated Centre for Health, Devon Simon Mills is a herbalist who now [describes himself as a \"phytotherapist\"](http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=6720250368336924437) (it sounds posher, but the evidence, or lack of it, is not changed by the fancy name). Mills likes to say things like \"there are herbs for heating and drying\", \"hot and cold\" remedies, and to use meaningless terms like [\"blood cleanser\"](http://dcscience.net/?p=16), but he appears to be immune to the need for good evidence that herbs work before you give them to sick people. [He says, at the end of a talk, ](http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=6720250368336924437) \"The hot and the cold remain the trade secret of traditional medicine\". And this is the 21st Century. Practical ways in which complementary approaches can improve the treatment of cancer. Professor Jane Plant, Author of \"Your life in your hands\" and Chief Scientist, British Geological Society and Professor Karol Sikora, Medical Director, Cancer Partners UK Jane Plant is a geologist who, through her own unfortunate encounter with breast cancer, became obsessed with the idea that a dairy-free diet cured her. Sadly there is no good evidence for that idea, according to the [World Cancer Research Fund Report](http://dcscience.net/Marmot-Report.pdf), led by Professor Sir Michael Marmot. No doubt her book on the subject sells well, but it could be held that it is irresponsible to hold out false hopes to desperate people. She is a supporter of the very dubious [CancerActive](http://dcscience.net/?p=119) organisation (also supported by Michael Dixon OBE - [see above](#dixon)) as well as the notorious pill salesman, [Patrick Holford](http://holfordwatch.info/) (see also [here](#)). Karol Sikora, formerly an oncologist at the Hammersmith Hospital, is now [Dean of Medicine](http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/medicine/) at the [University of Buckingham](http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/) (the UK's only private university). He is also medical director at [CancerPartners UK](http://www.cancerpartnersuk.org/), a private cancer company. He recently shot to fame when he [appeared in a commercial](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/may/13/advertising-campaign-nhs-us-healthcare-reforms) in the USA sponsored by \"Conservatives for Patients' Rights\", to pour scorn on the NHS, and to act as an advocate for the USA's present health system. A very curious performance. Very curious indeed. His attitude to quackery is a mystery wrapped in an enigma. One was somewhat alarmed to see him sponsoring a course at what was, at first, called the British College of Integrated Medicine, and has now been renamed the [Faculty of Integrated Medicine](http://www.integratedmedicine.org.uk/) That grand title makes it sound like part of a university. It isn't. The alarm was as result of the alliance with Dr Rosy Daniel (who promotes an [untested herbal conconction, Carctol](http://www.healthcreation.co.uk/node/20), for 'healing' cancer) and Dr Mark who has also [promoted the Qlink pendant](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-398105/Good-vibrations.html). The Qlink pendant is a simple [and obvious fraud](http://www.badscience.net/2007/05/the-amazing-qlink-science-pedant/) designed to exploit paranoia about WiFi killing you. The first list of speakers on the proposed diploma in Integrated Medicine was an unholy alliance of outright quacks and commercial interests. It turned out that, although Karol Sikora is sponsoring the course, he knew nothing about the speakers. I did and when I pointed this out to Terence Kealey, vice-chancellor of Buckingham, he immediately removed Rosy Daniel from directing the Diploma. At the moment the course is being revamped entirely by Andrew Miles. There is hope that he'll do a better job. It has not yet been validated by the University of Buckingham. Watch this space for developments. Stop press It is [reported in the Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/may/22/karol-sikora-honorary-professor-imperial-college) that Professor Sikora has been describing his previous job at Imperial College with less than perfect accuracy.

Four pitchers lay out their stall for the commissioning dragons And at this stage there is no prize for guessing that all four are devoted to trying to get funds for discredited treatments - An acupuncture service for long-term pain. Mike Cummings Chair, Medical Acupuncture Association - Manipulation for the treatment of back pain Simon Fielding, Founder Chairman of the General Osteopathic Council - Nigel Clarke, Senior Partner, Learned Lion Partners Homeopathy for long term conditions - Peter Fisher, Director, Royal Homeopathic Hospital Sadly it is not stated who the dragons are. One hopes they will be more interested in evidence than the supplicants. Mike Cummings at least doesn't believe the nonsense about meridians and Qi. It's a pity he doesn't look at the real evidence though. You can read something about him and his journal at [BMJ Group promotes acupuncture: pure greed](http://dcscience.net/?p=351). Osteopathy sounds a bit more respectable than the others, but in fact it has never shaken off its [cult-like origins.](http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/QA/osteo.html) Still many osteopaths make absurd claims to cure all sorts of diseases. Offshoots of osteopathy like 'cranial osteopathy' are obvious nonsense. There is no reason to think that osteopathy is any better than any other manipulative therapy and it is clear that all manipulative therapies should be grouped into one. Osteopathy and chiropractic provide the best ever examples of the folly of giving official government recognition to a branch of alternative medicine before the evidence is in. Learned Lion Partners is a new one on me. It seems it is part of [Madsen Gornall Ashe Chambers ('MGA Chambers')](http://www.mgagroup.co.uk/AMWL/LL_fset.htm) \"a grouping of top level, independent specialists who provide a broad range of management consultancy advice to the marketing community\". It's a management consultant and marketing outfit. So don't expect too much when it comes to truth and evidence. The company web site says nothing about alternative medicine, but only that [Nigel Clarke](http://www.mgagroup.co.uk/fsetpeople.htm) \". . . has very wide experience of public affairs issues and campaigns, having worked with clients in many sectors in Europe, North America and the Far East. He has particular expertise in financial, competition and healthcare issues. \" However, all is revealed when we see that he is a [Trustee of the Prince's Foundation](http://www.fih.org.uk/about_us/our_trustees.html) where his entry says \"Nigel Clarke is senior partner of Learned Lion Partners. He is a director of Vidapulse Ltd, Really Easy Ltd, Newscounter Ltd and Advanced Transport Systems Ltd. He has worked on the interfaces of public policy for 25 years. He has been chair of the General Osteopathic Council since May 2001, having been a lay member since it was formed. He is now a member of the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence\" The [Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence](http://www.chre.org.uk/) is yet another quango that ticks boxes and fails absolutely to grasp the one important point, does it work?. I came across them [at the Westminster Forum](http://dcscience.net/?p=15#chre), and they seemed a pretty pathetic way to spend \u00a32m per year. Peter Fisher is the last supplicant to the Dragons. He is clinical director of the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital (RLHH), and Queen's homeopathic physician, It was through him that I got an active interest in quackery. The TV programme QED asked me to check the statistics in a paper of his that claimed that [homeopathy was good for fibrositis](http://dcscience.net/?p=201) (there was an elementary mistake and no evidence for an effect). Peter Fisher is also remarkable because he agreed with me that BSc degrees in homeopathy were not justified (on TV - [see the movie](http://dcscience.net/?p=19)). And [he condemned homeopaths](http://dcscience.net/?p=207) who were caught out recommending their sugar pills for malaria. To that extent Fisher represents the saner end of the homeopathic spectrum. Nevertheless he still maintains that sugar pills work and have effects of their own, and tries to [justify the 'memory of water'](http://dcscience.net/?p=282#hom) by making analogies with a memory stick or CD. This is so obviously silly that no more comment is needed. Given Fisher's sensible condemnation of the malaria fiasco, I was rather surprised to see that he appeared on the [programme of a conference](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/CAM/docs/CAMSTRAND%20programme%20Apr%2009%20final.pdf) at the University of Middlesex, talking about \"A Strategy To Research The Potential Of Homeopathy In Pandemic Flu\". The title of the conference was Developing Research Strategies in CAM. A colleague, after seeing the programme, thought it was more like \"a right tossers' ball\". Much of the homeopathy has now vanished from the RLHH as a result of greatly reduced commissioning by PCTs ( [read about it](http://www.zeusinfoservice.com/Health/Hospitalneedsyoursupport.html) in Fisher's own words). And the [last homeopathy degree in the UK has closed down](http://dcscience.net/?p=1329). It seems an odd moment for the FIH to be pushing it so hard. Follow-up Stop press It is [reported in the Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/may/22/karol-sikora-honorary-professor-imperial-college) (22 May 2009) that [Professor Sikora](#sikora) has been describing his previous job at Imperial College with less than perfect accuracy. Oh dear, oh dear. This fascinating fact seems to have been unearthed first by the admirable NHS Blog Doctor, in his post ' [Imperial College confirm that Karol Sikora does not work for them and does not "}
