What is holistic health? Holistic medicine takes all aspects of a person's health when treating someone including physical, mental, and emotional factors. Since healing isn't limited to just the physical aspects, holistic medicine brings in various forms of health care to treat a patient from conventional treatments and medicine to alternative wellness therapies. One major way that holistic medicine differs from other forms of medicine - specifically conventional medicine - is that it's goal is to find and treat the root cause behind a person's health problems in order to alleviate symptoms rather than utilizing medication or surgery as the main way to treat symptoms. What are holistic health benefits? Since holistic medicine doesn't limit itself to a single approach, there is a wider range of treatment options given to a patient including holistic medicine therapies and conventional medicine. This in of itself gives patients a variety of benefits unique to this model of healthcare. - Safe: treatments often have little to no side effects - Preventative: focuses on diet and lifestyle to prevent further health problems - Patient-centered: treatments are unique to each person depending on their physical, mental, and emotionally needs - Integrative: utilizes the best of modern medicine with tried and true natural therapies How can women benefit from holistic health? Unfortunately, women are not always taken seriously by their conventional doctors leaving them feeling unheard and left without viable treatment options. It has been all too easy to dismiss symptoms that are ultimately part of a larger, underlying problem. Women have their own special set of healthcare needs unique to men. Not to say that men can't and don't deal with some of the same issues, but when it comes to female reproductive health, that's where we often see the disconnect in conventional medicine. Holistic women's health combines all of these benefits in order to address the most common hormonal problems specific to women such as: - Low libido - Endometriosis - Fatigue - Infertility - Hot flashes - Hormone imbalances - Irregular periods - Mood swings - PCOS - Thyroid problems - Weight loss resistance Holistic women's health puts the power back into the patients hands. Because holistic medicine is patient-centered, by giving women a voice to share their physical symptoms as well as what they are going through mentally and emotionally, we are able to tap into the benefits of holistic health and find a solution for long-term sustainable healing. Also because holistic medicine is preventative, safe, and integrative, we are able to provide real, scientific-backed answers to why women are feeling the way that they feel, give them non-invasive treatment options with little side effects, and empower them with the ability to choose the best treatment option for them and their specific life. How can Dr. Will Cole help with holistic women's health? A lot of this has to do with the training of conventional medicine doctors. Most of them have learned to pair symptoms with a matching medication and call it a day after running lab work that just doesn't cut it. Conventional medicine utilizes lab work that calculates the average from the results of every person who runs a lab. However, that doesn't really work when it is only sick people who run labs. Therefore, what is considered \"healthy\" is not always going to be accurate. That's why, for many women they are told their hormones are within the \"normal\" range when they are anything but normal. Functional medicine offers a different solution by looking at a narrower reference range in order to get to the root cause behind women's health problems. When it comes to holistic women's health, it is my job to make sure each patient is truly heard and health problems are addressed in a way that facilitates healing in all areas of wellbeing including mental, emotional, and physical.
