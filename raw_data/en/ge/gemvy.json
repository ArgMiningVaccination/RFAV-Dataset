Furthermore, no party to a treaty or inter- national agreement subject to registration which has not been registered may invoke that treaty or agree- ment before any organ of the United Nations. The General Assembly by resolution 97 (I) established regulations to give effect to Article 102 of the Charter (see text of the regulations, vol. 76, p. XVIII). The terms \"treaty\" and \"international agreement\" have not been defined either in the Charter or in the regulations, and the Secretariat follows the principle that it acts in accordance with the position of the Member State submitting an instrument for registration that so far as that party is concerned the instru- ment is a treaty or an international agreement within the meaning of Article 102. Registration of an instrument submitted by a Member State, therefore, does not imply ajudgement by the Secretariat on the nature of the instrument, the status of a party or any similar question. It is the understanding of the Secretariat that its action does not confer on the instrument the status of a treaty or an international agree- ment if it does not already have that status and does not confer on a party a status which it would not other- wise have. Unless otherwise indicated, the translations of the original texts of treaties, etc., published in this Series have been made by the Secretariat of the United Nations.

Article IV The limitations provided for in article III shall not apply to ABM systems or their components used for development or testing, and located within current or additionally agreed test ranges. Each Party may have no more than a total of fifteen ABM launchers at test ranges. Article V 1. Each Party undertakes not to develop, test, or deploy ABM systems or components which are sea-based, air-based, space-based, or mobile land- based. 2. Each Party undertakes not to develop, test, or deploy ABM launchers for laun- ching more than one ABM interceptor missile at a time from each launcher, nor to modify deployed launchers to provide them with such a capability, nor to develop, test, or deploy automatic or semi-automatic or other similar systems for rapid reload of ABM launchers.

ETATS-UNIS D'AMERIQUE et UNION DES REPUBLIQUES SOCIALISTES limitations en 1974. Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Trait~s BASIC PRINCIPLES' OF NEGOTIATIONS ON THE FURTHER LIMI- TATION OF STRATEGIC OFFENSIVE ARMS The President of the United States of America, Richard Nixon, and the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU, L. I. Brezhnev, Having thoroughly considered the question of the further limitation of strategic arms, and the progress already achieved in the current negotiations, Reaffirming their conviction that the earliest adoption of further limitations of strategic arms would be a major contribution in reducing the danger of an outbreak of nuclear war and in strengthening international peace and security, Have agreed as follows: First. The two Sides will continue active negotiations in order to work out a permanent agreement on more complete measures on the limitation of strategic offensive arms, as well as their subsequent reduction, proceeding from the Basic Prin- ciples of Relations between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics signed in Moscow on May 29, 1972, and from the Interim Agree- ment between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Repub- lics on May 26, 1972,2 on certain measures with respect to the limitation of strategic offensive arms. Over the course of the next year the two Sides will make serious efforts to work out the provisions of the permanent agreement on more complete measures on the limitation of strategic offensive arms with the objective of signing it in 1974. Second. New agreements on the limitation of strategic offensive armaments will be based on the principles of the American-Soviet documents adopted in Moscow in May 1972 and the agreements reached in Washington in June 1973; and in particular, both Sides will be guided by the recognition of each other's equal security interests and by the recognition that efforts to obtain unilateral advantage, directly or indi- rectly, would be inconsistent with the strengthening of peaceful relations between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Third. The limitations placed on strategic offensive weapons can apply both to their quantitative aspects as well as to their qualitative improvement. Fourth. Limitations on strategic offensive arms must be subject to adequate verification by national technical means. Fifth. The modernization and replacement of strategic offensive arms would be permitted under conditions which will be formulated in the agreements to be concluded. Sixth. Pending the completion of a permanent agreement on more complete measures of strategic offensive arms limitation, both Sides are prepared to reach agreements on separate measures to supplement the existing Interim Agreement of May 26, 1972. Seventh. Each Side will continue to take necessary organizational and technical measures for preventing accidental or unauthorized use of nuclear weapons under its Came into force on 21 June 1973 by signature. 2 See p. 3 of this volume.1974 1974 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Trait6s 43 control in accordance with the Agreement of September 30,1971,' between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

C. Permissible exports Period during which Commodity Quantity exports are permitted Sesam e seed ............................................. 725 M T FY 1973 Item V Self Help Measures A. Recognizing the critical importance of agriculture to Afghanistan's national economy, the Royal Government of Afghanistan continues to give highest priority to agricultural development during the Fourth Five Year Plan. Included within this high priority will be adaptive research and extension services for the wider use of fertilizer and improved seed for wheat and other crops under programs mutually agreed upon between the Royal Government of Afghanistan and the Government of the United States of America. B. The Royal Government of Afghanistan recognizes that continued agricultural development will result in Afghanistan's achievement of wheat sufficiency or surplus conditions in the next few years. Changing supply and demand conditions will make careful management of national wheat resources and of other commodities increas- ingly essential. The Royal Government of Afghanistan will begin the analysis of present and future conditions and the planning necessary to create a national wheat management program. This program will include establishment of a national wheat reserve and a price stabilization system. The specific steps the Royal Government of Afghanistan desires to take are as follows: 1. Reform, improve and utilize the personnel and facilities of the Food Procure- ment Department to achieve as soon as possible the following goals: (a) Timely and accurate routine reporting procedures for wheat acquisitions, move- ments to provincial storage and distribution centers, dispersals and stock posi- tions. 13450 76 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitts 1974 (b) Improve and utilize nationwide communications and coordinate with other infor- mation-gathering organizations in order to monitor grain prices and availabilities for the purpose of anticipating local or national shortages or surpluses. 2. Establish effective financial reporting procedures of receipts and expenditures by the Food Procurement Department to the Ministry of Finance. 3. The Royal Government of Afghanistan has stated its intention to initiate and complete as soon as possible a formal broad study to determine the management, personnel, financial and physical resources, and the planning required to establish a national wheat storage, procurement, and distribution system. Furthermore, the Royal Government of Afghanistan desires to take advantage of technical and other assistance potentially available from international organizations and countries to cooperate in carrying out the study and formulating and implementing recommenda- tions to create the system. 4. In agreement with the principle that the Royal Government of Afghanistan must participate and intervene in the national wheat market in order to build stocks for its own use and to support reasonable prices to wheat farmers, the Government is carrying out and plans to complete a purchase program designed to procure domes- tically as much as 35,000 metric tons of wheat during Afghan fiscal year 1351. C. The Royal Government of Afghanistan is strengthening the provincial devel- opment (including Food-For-Work) program to take full advantage of the potential of this national project to accelerate rural progress and improve economic conditions of people throughout the country. Item V. Economic Development Purposes for Which Proceeds Accruing to Impor- ting Country Are to Be Used The proceeds accruing to the importing country from the sale of com- modities financed under this Agreement will be used for financing the self-help measures set forth in item V and the development budget of the Royal Government of Afghanistan. Item VII. Ocean Freight (Differential) The Government of the exporting country shall bear the cost of ocean freight differential for commodities it requires to be carried in United States flag vessels but, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of the Convertible Local Currency Credit Annex, it shall not finance the balance of the cost of ocean transportation of such commodities. Item VIII. Other Provisions A. The Government of the exporting country elects, pursuant to paragraph 6 of the Convertible Currency Credit Annex, that all payments under item II, 2, of this part II be made in Afghanis, which shall be used by the Government of the exporting country for payment of its obligations in the importing country. 13450 1974 United Nations -Treaty Series 9 Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitts 77 B. The currency use payment under item II, 2, of this part II shall be credited against (a) the amount of each year's interest payment due during the period prior to the due date of the first installment payment, starting with the first year, plus (b) the combined payments of principal and interest starting with the first installment payment, until value of the currency use payment has been offset. C. Substitute the following for paragraph 4 of the Convertible Local Currency Annex: The total amount of funds to be applied to the economic development uses set forth in part II of this Agreement shall be not less than the local currency equivalent of the dollar disbursement by the Government of the exporting country in connection with the financing of the commodities (other than the ocean freight differential), provided, however, that the total amount so applied shall be reduced by the payment, if any, made by the Government of the importing country pursuant to the provision in Section 103(b) of the Act (such payment is herein called \"the currency use payment\"). The exchange rate to be used in calculating this local currency equivalent shall be the rate at which the central monetary authority of the importing country, or its authorized agent, sells foreign exchange for local currency in connection with the commercial import of the same commodities. Any accrued proceeds that are loaned by the Govern- ment of the importing country to private or non-governmental organizations shall be loaned at rates of interest approximately equivalent to those charged for comparable loans in the importing country. The Government of the importing country shall furnish, in accordance with its fiscal year budget reporting proce- dures, at such times as may be requested by the Government of the exporting country but not less than annually, a report of the allocation of the equivalent funds committed to the economic development uses set forth in part II of this Agreement, certified by the appropriate audit authority of the Government of the importing country, and in the case of expenditures the budget sector in which they were used. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the respective representatives, duly authorized for the purpose, have signed the present Agreement. DONE at Kabul, in duplicate, this 21st, day of February, 1973. For the Government For the Royal Government of the United States of America: of Afghanistan: [Signed] [Signed] ROBERT G. NEUMANN MOHAMMAD KHAN JALALLAR Ambassador Minister of Finance 13450 78 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitts 1974 MINUTE OF UNDERSTANDING SUPPLEMENT TO THE 1973 PL 480 TITLE I AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND THE ROYAL GOVERNMENT OF AFGHANISTAN 1. It is noted that the United States Government (USG) is hopeful that all of the wheat programmed can be shipped before June 30,1973, but because of the tight wheat situation in the United States and the limitations placed on PL 480 expenditures, it may be necessary to ship some commodities shortly thereafter. It also is noted that at the time the program was developed it was expected that 50,000 metric tons of wheat could be procured within the Maximum Export Market Value originally specified. However, because of recent price increases the amount of financing which is provided in the 1973 Agreement will not be sufficient to purchase the original quantity. To the extent that the finances of the USG will permit, the USG desires to increase the Maximum Export Market Value of the 1973 Agreement to enable the RGA to approach its desired quantity. Even so, the RGA understands that the USG will not be able to finance the full amount of 50,000 MT of wheat. If it does become possible to provide additional financing during the USG Fiscal Year 1973, an amendment to the 1973 Agreement can accomplish the purpose. 2. The Currency Use Payment to be made by the Royal Government of Afghanistan (RGA) in accordance with part II, item II, 2, of the 1973 Agreement will be made in Afghanis upon demand by the USG. 3. The RGA agrees that in the event it should make commercial purchases of wheat and/or wheat flour, the U.S. will be given an opportunity to participate. The provisions of the U.S. Commodity Credit Corporation credits have been made available to the RGA. 4. The RGA agrees that it will continue to import at least 6,800 MT of edible vegetable and marine oil. Of this total amount, not less than 4,600 MT will be edible vegetable oil as stated in the 1973 Agreement under the Usual Marketing Requirement. 5. Since the self-help measures included in the March 27, 1971 Agreement' are of a long- term nature and complementary to the self-help measures of the 1973 Agreement, the RGA is continuing them. The self-help Minute of Understanding and termination clause of the July 19, 1967, Agreement also apply to the 1973 Agreement. The RGA also notes its responsibility for preparing an annual report on the self-help measures and agrees to submit it each year as appro- priate on or before December 1 of each year. 6. The USG and the RGA agree to the arrangements for identification and publicity as in previous agreements. 7. a) The RGA recognizes that reporting is an essential part of its programming responsi- bilities and understands the necessity for submitting reports as required under the Agreement, part I, article III, D. The reports are due to the U.S. Embassy by the fifteenth of January, April, July, and October covering information referred to in subparagraphs 2, 3 and 4 of paragraph D. In particular, the RGA will include the quantity of sesame seed exported during the export limi- tation period of this Agreement. b) The RGA further agrees to return the completed \"arrival and shipping\" information (ADP sheets) with appropriate notations certifying receipt of all commodities as soon as possible, but not later than 30 days from the date of unloading in the importing country or 30 days from receipt of the ADP sheets, whichever is later. 8. The exchange rate to be used by the RGA to fulfill the requirement of part II, item VIII, C, will be that of the day upon which the commodities of the 1973 Agreement are received in Afghanistan.

CLAYTON YEUTTER POR RAFAEL MARIlJO Department of Agriculture Ministry of Agriculture of the United States of the Republic of Colombia DANIEL SZABO RAFAEL MARIFO Department of State Colombian Agricultural Institute August 18, 1973 ANNEX I [See insert in a pocket at the end of this volume.] ANNEX II REPORT OF THE COLOMBIAN -U.S. JOINT TECHNICAL TEAM ON FMD PREVENTION AND CONTROL IN THE AREAS ADJACENT TO THE COLOMBO-PANAMANIAN BORDER The Colombian -U.S. Joint Technical Commission after having visited the Colombian border areas adjacent to the Colombo-Panamanian border and studied the FMD program proposed for these areas recommends that the following actions are necessary to form the basis for an effective Aftosa prevention and control program. I. ESTABLISHMENT OF \"Los KATIOS\" NATIONAL PARK A. ParkBoundaries. Beginning at the highest point of Alto Lim6n (point #1) the boundary follows a straight line SE to point #2 located on the west side of the SautatA-Morro de Censi6n road; then following a straight line SW to point #2A located 2 kilometers west of the main house of the Hacienda SautatA; from this point following a straight line to point #3 on the west (left) bank of the Atrato River where the Sautati-Morro de Censi6n road meets the river; along the west (left) bank of the Atrato River to point #4 where the Atrato and Perancho Rivers meet; along the north (left) bank of the Perancho River to the mouth of the Cacarica River (point #5); up the Cacarica River to the Colombo-Panamanian border (point #6); north east along the border to point #7 where the border cuts the 600 meter elevation line; from this point on a straight line south to point #1. B. Activity Permitted. 1) Only activities associated with the Darien Gap Highway and normal park activities will be permitted within the boundaries of the National Park. Except for the Darien Gap Highway no other connecting road construction will be permitted. 13452 United Nations -Treaty Series 9 Nations Unies -Recueii des Trait~s 2) All people and animals now living within the park area, with the exception of Indians, will have to be relocated outside of the boundaries of the park. 3) Indians living in the park will be permitted to maintain yarded swine. However, with respect to this swine the following provisions will apply: a) Swine will be subject to continuous observation and inspection. b) All swine movement within the park will be controlled and supervised. c) Swine will be utilized for local consumption by Indians in the area only. 4) Vigilance and control measures to prevent illegal movement of animals and animal products into or through the Park will be established. In addition special measures will be concentrated in the Alto Lim6n where the river valley has historically provided an access route for movement into Panama, and other areas which may be designated at a later date. II. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PROTECTED FOREST ZONE A. Boundaries of the Zone. The zone will be constituted by the Colombo-Panamanian border on the west and on the east by a line which begins at point #1 in Alto Lim6n and follows the 300 meter elevation line in a northward direction across the Capitan River Valley where the boundary becomes the 200 meter line from this point to the Atlantic Coast. In the river valleys a limit will be drawn at the last farm upstream existing on June 9, 1973, where this is below the relevant elevation line. Establishment of new farms above this limit will not be permitted. B. Activity Permitted. 1) This zone will be maintained for study of flora and fauna. No economic activity will be permitted in the zone and no livestock other than yarded swine main- tained by Indians will be allowed. Swine will be under the same inspection and control condi- tions stipulated in Point I, B (3), above. Regarding people and livestock now living within this zone each case will be studied on an individual basis with the objective of relocating them if they constitute a danger. 2) Special vigilance and control measures to prevent establishment of new farms and illegal movement of animals and animal products into and through the zone will be implemented. III. FOREST RESERVE ZONE A. Boundaries of the Zone. A forest reserve zone will be constituted south of the \"Los Katios\" park to the Pacific Coast bounded on the west by the Colombo-Panamanian border, and on the east by the following line: along the Atrato River from the outlet of the Cacarica River to the mouth of the Truando River, along the Truando River to its source at the Serrania de los Saltos and from this point on a straight line to Guarin on the Bay of Humbolt. B. ActivityPermitted. Lumbering activity will be permitted in the forest reserve zone under strict regulations and control to prevent any new livestock activities. Existing towns in the zone will be permitted to continue with essential farming activities. 1) The movement of food particularly livestock products into the area will be closely super- vised and controlled. 2) Any meat or livestock products introduced into the area must come from points in FMD free areas or Area 1 designated by the Animal Health Service. 3) Special vigilance and control measures to prevent establishment of farms and illegal movement of animals and animal products into and through the zone will be established. 4) The cattle existing in the Jurad6 area, which is free of FMD, will be maintained at the present level and under the supervision of the Animal Health Service. IV. INTENSIFICATION FO THE AFTOSA CONTROL PROGRAM A. Area 1 will be designated as a FMD erradication area with the.objective of freeing the area of FMD as soon as possible and maintaining the area free of FMD. To achieve this the present program will be intensified and implemented as follows: 13452 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recuell des Traitts (1) Preventive actions (a) Livestock will be subject to continuous inspection and indentified with a special brand to facilitate identification and control. A census of the livestock population will also be taken and maintained. Probang and VIA testing will be used as appropriate. (b) Movement of the livestock and by-products into and out of area 1 and within the area will be strictly controlled. Introduction of livestock and by products from FMD infected areas will be prohibited. (c) As soon as feasible studies of the susceptible wildlife population in the area will be carried out. (d) The Anti-Aftosa education and publicity campaign will also be intensified and imple- mented. (2) Requirements to declare Area I free of FMD (a) Fulfillment of the preventive action program. (b) Suspension of cattle vaccination. (c) Establishment of an indemnity fund. In this connection it will be necessary to have a controlled livestock development program in the area on the basis of the present cattle popula- tion in Area 1 until erradication of FMD is completed in area 2. Imports of breeding stock will be permitted from FMD free areas solely for improving the quality of the existing cattle population during this period. If the importation of breeding stock from FMD free areas is not possible, special quarantine measures will be required to introduce animals from other areas.

The USG shall bear only the cost of the ocean freight differential for the commodities it requires to be carried in U.S. flag vessels. 7. Both entities understand that the new Title I procedures not longer requires PL 480 sales proceeds to be deposited in a special account.

For this purpose, President Nixon has designated Mr. James R. Green as his special emissary. \"It has been clearly established by the Government of Peru that the IPC case will not for any reason be a subject of said conversations inasmuch as this is a matter which has been definitively resolved. The Government of the United States recognizes that this is the position of the Revolutionary Government. \"The conversations will observe the most complete respect for the autono- mous and sovereign decisions of both Governments as well as for the profound transformations being carried out by the Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces of Peru. \"The two Governments agree that the conversations will contribute to the improvement of their relations, making them more cordial and constructive.\" As a result of those conversations, the Government of the United States and the Government of Peru, desirous of arriving at a solution of pending problems, and with the objective of definitively concluding them and avoiding the presentation of future claims on these matters, have decided to conclude the following Agreement: Article L A. The pending problems to which this Agreement refers are the claims of United States nationals arising prior to the date of this Agreement as a result of expropriation or other forms of permanent taking by the Revolutionary Govern- ment of the Armed Forces of Peru of property and interests in property, direct or indirect, and the claims of the Government of Peru against such United States nationals, as well as the claims of United States nationals and the Government of Peru over certain road construction contracts arising prior to the date of this Agreement.

Washington, D.C., March 7, 1974 Sir, I refer to the discussions which have recently taken place between representa- tives of the Government of Finland and the Government of the United States of America regarding reaching an understanding concerning the reciprocal acceptance of certificates of airworthiness for imported civil glider aircraft and civil aircraft appliances. It is my understanding that the Agreement shall be as follows: 1. (a) The present Agreement applies to civil glider aircraft and civil aircraft appliances (hereinafter referred to as \"products\") constructed in the United States, its territories and possessions and exported to Finland; and to similar products constructed in Finland and exported to the United States, its territories and possessions. (b) As used herein: (i) The term civil glider aircraft shall include spare parts for civil glider aircraft which have been exported in accordance with this Agreement; (ii) The term aircraft appliance means any equipment or aircraft part installed in, intended to be installed in, or attached to an aircraft, including replacement or modification parts therefor, but which is not a part of an aircraft engine or propeller and which is separately deter- mined to be included in this Agreement by mutual consent of the competent authorities of the United States and Finland. 2. The same validity shall be conferred by the competent authorities of Finland on certifi- cates of airworthiness for export issued by the competent authorities of the United States for products exported to Finland as if they had been issued under the regulations in force on the subject in Finland, provided, that such products have been constructed in the United States, its territories or possessions, and the competent authority of the United States has certified that the type design of the product complies with the airworthiness requirements of the United States together with any special conditions prescribed in accordance with paragraph 6, and has certi- fied that the particular product conforms to such type design. 3. The same validity shall be conferred by the competent authorities of the United States on certificates of airworthiness for export issued by the competent authorities of Finland for products exported to the United States as if they had been issued under the regulations in force on the subject in the United States, provided that such products have been constructed in ' Came into force on 7 March 1974, the date of the note in reply, in accordance with the provisions of the said notes. 13457 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Trait6s Finland and the competent authority of Finland has certified that the type design of the product complies with the airworthiness requirements of Finland together with any special conditions prescribed in accordance with paragraph 6, and has certified that the particular product conforms to such type design. 4. (a) The competent authorities of Finland shall arrange for the effective communication to the competent authorities of the United States of particulars of compulsory modifications prescribed in Finland for the purpose of enabling the authorities of the United States to require these modifications to be made to products of the types affected, whose certificates have been validated by them. (b) In the case of products for which Finland has issued certificates of airworthiness, subse- quently validated by the United States, the competent authorities of Finland shall, when requested, afford the competent authorities of the United States assistance in determining that major design changes or major repairs made to such products comply with the applicable airworthiness requirements of Finland. 5. (a) The competent authorities of the United States shall arrange for the effective commu- nication to the competent authorities of Finland of particulars of compulsory modifications prescribed in the United States, for the purpose of enabling the authorities of Finland to require these modifications to be made to products of the types affected, whose certificates have been validated by them. (b) In the case of products for which the United States has issued certificates of airworthi- ness for export, subsequently validated by Finland, the competent authorities of the United States shall, when requested, afford the competent authorities of Finland assistance in determi- ning that major design changes or major repairs made to such products comply with the appli- cable airworthiness requirements of the United States. 6. (a) The competent authorities of each country shall have the right to make the validation of certificates of airworthiness for export dependent upon the fulfillment of any special condi- tions which are for the time being required by them for the issuance of certificates of airworthi- ness in their own country. Information with regard to these special conditions in respect to either country will from time to time be communicated to the competent authorities of the other country. (b) The competent authorities of each country shall keep the competent authorities of the other country fully and currently informed of all regulations in force in regard to the airworthi- ness of products and any changes therein that may from time to time be affected. 7. The question of procedure to be followed in the application of the provisions of the present Agreement shall be subject of direct correspondence, whenever necessary, between the competent authorities of the United States and Finland. 8. The present Agreement shall be subject to termination by either Government upon six (6) months notice given in writing to the other Government. 9.

I also have the honour to refer to a meeting in Ottawa on September 4, 1973, during which United States officials were informed of Canadian policy decisions relating to the financing of Canada's defence programme and of several consequent adjustments in the programme. One of the adjustments involves the closing of certain radar stations of the extension of the continental radar defence system known as the Pinetree Line. On behalf of my Government and in accordance with paragraph two of the Cana- dian note of August 1,1951, 1 have the honour to request that your Government concur in the stations located at Armstrong, Foymount and Ramore, all in Ontario, being closed down operationally in April 1974 and taken out of service completely in October 1974. Detailed arrangements concerning the implementation of the deactiva- tion programme would be worked out between the appropriate authorities of our two Governments and the disposition of excess United States property at the sites would be in accordance with the exchange of notes of our two Governments of August 28, 1961, and September 1, 1961,4 concerning the disposal of United States excess property in Canada. The removal and relocation of any radar or other equipment or portions thereof from these three stations to other Pinetree stations in Canada, as well as the installa- tion of such radar or other equipment or portions thereof at other Pinetree stations in Canada, will be accomplished by the Government of Canada at its expense. The Government of Canada will reimburse the Government of the United States for any costs the latter may incur as a result of terminating any contract, or portion thereof, for the modification of radar or other equipment at any of the three stations being closed. Came into force on 22 March 1974 by the exchange of the said notes. 2 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 233, p. 109. 3 Ibid., vol. 807, p. 19.

Article 3. (1) Each Contracting Party shall have the right to designate in writing to the other Contracting Party one airline for the purpose of operating the agreed services on the specified routes. (2) On receipt of such designation, the other Contracting Party shall, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (3) and (4) of this article, without delay grant to the designated airline the appropriate operating authorization. (3) The Aeronautical Authorities of one Contracting Party may require the airline designated by the other Contracting Party to satisfy them that it is qualified to fulfil the conditions prescribed under the laws and regulations normally and reaso- nably applied to the operation of international air services by such authorities in conformity with the provisions of the Convention. (4) Each Contracting Party shall have the right to refuse to grant the operating authorization referred to in paragraph (2) of this article, or to impose such conditions as it may deem necessary on the exercise by a designated airline of the rights specified in article 2, in any case where the said Contracting Party is not satisfied that substantial ownership and effective control of that airline are vested in the Contracting Party designating the airline or in its nationals. (5) When an airline has been so designated and authorized it may begin at any time to operate the agreed services, provided that a tariff established in accordance with the provisions of article 10 of the present Agreement is in force in respect of that service. Article4. (1) There shall be fair and equal opportunity for the designated airline of each Contracting Party to operate on any route specified in accordance with article 2, of the present Agreement. (2) In the operation of international air services on the routes specified in accor- dance with article 2 of the present Agreement the designated airline of one Contract- ing Party shall take account of the interests of the designated airline of the other Contracting Party so as not to affect unduly the air services which the latter airline provides on the same routes or parts of them. (3) The international air services on the routes specified in accordance with article 2 of the present Agreement shall have as their primary objective the provision of capacity adequate to the foreseeable traffic demands to and from the territory of the Contracting Party designating the airline. The right of either designated airline to carry traffic between points in the territory of the other Contracting Party and points on the territory of third countries on the specified routes in accordance with article 2 of the present Agreement, shall be exercised in the interests of an orderly development of international air transport in such a way that capacity is related to: (a) The traffic demand to and from the territory of the Contracting Party designating the airline. 13460 184 United Nations -Treaty Series e Nations Unies -Recueil des Trait~s 1974 (b) The traffic demand existing in the areas through which the air services pass, taking account of local and regional services. (c) The requirements of an economical operation of through services. Article 5.

Passengers in transit across the territory of either Contracting Party shall be subject to no more than a very simplified control. Baggage and cargo in direct transit shall be exempt from customs duties and other similar taxes. Article 10.

(3) The tariffs so agreed shall be submitted for approval to the Aeronautical Authorities of the Contracting Parties at least thirty (30) days before the proposed date of their introduction; in special cases, this time limit may be reduced, subject to the agreement of the said authorities. (4) If the designated airlines cannot agree on any of these tariffs, or if for some other reason a tariff cannot be fixed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (2) of this article, or if during the first 15 days of the 30 days' period referred to in para- graph (3) of this article one Contracting Party gives the other Contracting Party notice of its dissatisfaction with any tariff agreed in accordance with the provisions of para- graph (2) of this article, the Aeronautical Authorities of the Contracting Parties shall try to determine the tariff by agreement between themselves.

Any modifications so agreed shall come into force when they have been confirmed by an exchange of diplo- matic notes. (2) Modifications to the annex of this Agreement may be agreed between the Aeronautical Authorities of the Contracting Parties. Article 14. The present Agreement and the annex to this Agreement will be amended so as to conform with any multilateral convention which may become binding on both Contracting Parties. Article 15.

Ibid., vol. 473, p. 362. 6 Ibid., vol. 646, p. 388. United Nations -Treaty Series e Nations Unies -Recueil des Traits In the event of a devaluation or appreciation of any of the Scandinavian curren- cies, the Governments shall negotiate regarding such adjustment of the guaranteed amounts as is required to re-establish in principle the present comparative values of the guaranteed amounts and which may otherwise be considered motivated with due regard to the circumstances on which this Agreement is based. Article 2. Should a deficit arise from the operations of one of the companies during any of the fiscal years stated in article 1, the said company shall be able to receive compensation for the deficit out of funds made available by the respective State, up to a maximum amount corresponding to the guarantee stated for the year in question. The payment of guarantee amounts by Denmark and Norway to DDL and DNL, respectively, may be required only to the extent the deficit causes the capital of DDL and DNL in the Consortium SAS to fall below 65 million Danish Crowns and 62 million Norwegian Crowns, respectively, or brings about a default by SAS in the performance of the covenants regarding equity and working capital, agreed upon in connection with the American loans of the Consortium. The amounts thus made available shall, in the first place, be used to cover deficits in the operations conducted by the Consortium. In the event that the company's deficit is greater than the amount of the guarantee, the company shall be able to receive compensation for the difference during the following years of the period of guarantee from the amounts guaranteed in respect of these years, providing this is feasible. On application to the Government in question, the company may receive advances on the amounts stated in the first paragraph. The company shall pay a guarantee fee of 1 per cent per annum to the Govern- ment in question on all guaranteed amounts called up any time and not yet repaid. Article 3. It is the duty of the company in question to repay guaranteed amounts called up out of surpluses or other funds which the Consortium has made available for this purpose. As long as guaranteed amounts called up have not been repaid in toto the company may not declare a dividend without the consent of the competent Govern- ment authority, nor shall the dividend exceed 5 per cent of the share capital. More precise rules regarding repayment shall be established by agreement between the respective State and the company. Article 4. Amounts not repaid by 1 October 1985 may be remitted providing the financial position of the Consortium and the national company warrant such a step. Article 5. This Agreement shall come into force on 1 October 1970. IN CONFIRMATION WHEREOF the undersigned representatives plenipotentiary have signed this Agreement.

Each Contracting Party shall have the right to designate, by diplo- matic note, an airline to operate the agreed service on any route specified in the schedule of routes for such a Contracting Party and to substitute another airline for that previously designated. Article IV. 1. The Aeronautical Authorities of one Contracting Party, upon receipt of a notice of designation by the other Contracting Party, shall with a minimum of delay consistent with its laws and regulations grant to the airline so designated the appropriate authorization to operate the agreed services for which that airline has been designated. Came into force on 10 February 1971 by signature, in accordance with article Xxi. 2 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 15, p. 295. For the texts of the Protocols amending this Convention, see vol. 320, pp. 209 and 217; vol. 418, p. 161; vol. 514, p. 209; and vol. 740, p. 21. 13462 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traites 2. Upon receipt of such authorization the airline may begin at any time to operate the agreed services, provided that a tariff established in accordance with the provisions of article XII of this Agreement is in force in respect of that service. Article V. 1. Each Contracting Party reserves the right to withhold, revoke or impose conditions on the authorization granted to the airline designated by the other Contracting Party in accordance with article III of this Agreement: (a) in the event of failure by such airline to qualify before the Aeronautical Authorities of that Contracting Party under the laws and regulations applied by these author- ities in conformity with the Convention; (b) in the event of failure by such airline to comply with the laws and regulations of that Contracting Party; and (c) in the event that it is not satisfied that substantial ownership and effective control of the airline are vested in the Contracting Party designating the airline or its nationals. 2. Unless immediate action to revoke the authorization granted to the airline designated by the other Contracting Party is essential to prevent further infringement of such laws and regulations, the right to revoke such authorization shall be exercised only after consultation with the other Contracting Party. Article VI. 1. The laws, regulations and procedures of one Contracting Party relating to the admission to or departure from its territory of aircraft engaged in international air navigation or to the operation and navigation of such aircraft shall be complied with by the airline designated by the other Contracting Party upon entrance into, departure from and while within the said territory. 2.

Failure to reach a satisfactory agreement in matters regarding flight safety will constitute grounds for the application of article V. 1 (a); in other cases article XVII applies. 13462 United Nations -Treaty Series e Nations Unies -Recueil des Traites Article VIII. 1. Each Contracting Party may impose or permit to be imposed just and reasonable charges for the use of public airports and other facilities under its control, provided that such charges shall not be higher than the charges imposed upon all other aircraft engaged in similar international services. 2.

If the Aeronautical Authorities cannot agree upon such tariffs the dispute shall be settled in accordance with the provisions of article XVII of this Agreement. 6. No tariff shall come into force, unless it has been approved or accepted by the Aeronautical Authorities of both Contracting Parties. 7. The tariffs established in accordance with the provisions of this article shall remain in force until new tariffs have been established in accordance with the provi- sions of this article.

United -Treaty Series e Nations Unies -Recueil des Trait6s AGREEMENT' BETWEEN THE SWISS CONFEDERATION AND TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO RELATING TO AIR SERVICES The Swiss Federal Council and the Government of Trinidad and Tobago con- sidering that Switzerland and Trinidad and Tobago are Parties to the Convention on International Civil Aviation opened for signature at Chicago on the seventh day of December, 1944.2 Desiring to develop international co-operation in the field of air transport, and Desiring to conclude an agreement for the purpose of establishing regular air services between and beyond their respective territories, Have appointed plenipotentiaries who, duly authorised to that effect, have agreed as follows: Article 1. For the purpose of the present Agreement and its annex: a. The term \"the Convention\" means the Convention on International Civil Aviation opened for signature at Chicago on the seventh day of December, 1944; b. The term \"aeronautical authorities\" means, in the case of Switzerland, the Federal Air Office and, in the case of Trinidad and Tobago, the Minister responsible for the subject of Civil Aviation or in both cases any person or body authorised to perform the functions assigned to the said authorities. c. The term \"designated airline\" means an airline which one Contracting Party has designated, in accordance with article 3 of the present Agreement, for the operation of the agreed air services. d. The term \"tariff' shall be deemed to include all rates tolls, fares and charges for transportation, and the conditions of carriage, classifications, rules, regulations, prac- tices and services related thereto. Article 2. 1. Each Contracting Party grants to the other Contractilng Party the rights specified in the present Agreement, for the purpose of establishing air services on the routes specified in the schedules of the annex to the present Agreement. Such services and routes are hereafter called \"the agreed services\" and \"the specified routes\", respectively. 2. Subject to the provisions of the present Agreement the airline designated by each Contracting Party shall enjoy, while operating international services: a. the right to fly without landing across the territory of the other Contracting Party; b. the right to make stops in the said territory for non-traffic purposes; c. the right to take up and set down in the said territory at the points specified in the annex international traffic in passengers, cargo and mail. I Applied provisionally from 15 December 1971, the date of signature, and came into force definitively on 14 January 1974, the date on which the Contracting Parties notified each other of the fulfilment of their constitutional formalities, in accordance with article 19. 2 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 15, p. 295. For the texts of the Protocols amending this Convention, see vol. 320, pp. 209 and 217; vol. 418, p. 161; vol. 514, p. 209; and vol. 740, p. 21. 13463 1974 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitis 239 3. Nothing in this article shall be deemed to confer on the airline of one Con- tracting Party the privileges of taking up in the territory of the other Contracting Party, passengers, cargo and mail destined for another point in the territory of that other Contracting Party. Article 3. 1. Each Contracting Party shall have the right to designate one airline for the purpose of operating the agreed services. Such designation shall be effected by virtue of a written notification between aeronautical authorities of both Contracting Parties. 2. The Contracting Party which has received the notification of designation shall, subject to the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 of this article, grant without delay to the designated airline of the other Contracting Party the necessary operating authorisa- tion. 3. The aeronautical authorities of one Contracting Party may require the airline designated by the other Contracting Party to prove that it is qualified to fulfil the conditions prescribed under the laws and regulations normally applied to the operation of international air services by the said authorities in conformity with the provisions of the Convention. 4. Each Contracting Party shall have the right to refuse to grant the operating authorisation referred to in paragraph 2 of this article, or to impose such conditions as it may deem necessary for the exercise by the designated airline of the rights specified in article 2 of the present Agreement, whenever the said Contracting Party is not satisfied that substantial ownership and effective control of that airline are vested in the Con- tracting Party designating the airline or in its nationals. 5. Having received the operating authorisation, provided for under paragraph 2 of the present article, the designated airline may begin at any time to operate the agreed services, provided that tariffs established in accordance with the provisions of article 10 of the present Agreement are in force with respect to such services. Article 4. 1. Each Contracting Party shall have the right to revoke an operating authorisation or to suspend the exercise of the rights specified in article 2 of the present Agreement by the designated airline of the other Contracting Party or to impose such conditions as it may deem necessary on the exercise of such rights, if: a. it is not satisfied that substantial ownership and effective control of the said airline are vested in the Contracting Party designating the airline or in its nationals, or b. the said airline has failed to comply with the laws or regulations of the Contracting Party granting these rights, or c. the said airline fails to operate the agreed services in accordance with the conditions prescribed under the present Agreement and its annex. 2. Unless revocation, suspension or imposition of the conditions provided for under paragraph 1 of this article shall be essential to prevent further infringements of laws and regulations, such right shall be exercised only after consultation with the other Contracting Party. Article 5. 1. The designated airlines shall enjoy fair and equal opportunities to operate the agreed services between the territories of the Contracting Parties. 2. The designated airline of Each Contracting Party shall take into consideration the interests of the designated airline of the other Contracting Party so as not to affect unduly the agreed services of the latter airline. 240 United Nations -Treaty Series e Nations Unies -Recueil des Traites 1974 3. The capacity of transport offered by the designated airlines shall be adapted to traffic demands. 4. The main objective of the agreed services shall be to provide capacity corre- sponding to traffic demands between the territory of the Contracting Party which has designated the airline and the points served on the specified routes. 5. The right of each of the designated airlines to carry international traffic between the territory of the other Contracting Party and the territories of third countries shall be exercised in conformity with the general principles of normal development to which both Contracting Parties subscribe and subject to the condition that the capacity shall be adapted: a. to traffic demands from and to the territory of the Contracting Party which has designated the airline; b. to traffic demands of the areas through which the service passes, local and regional services being taken into account; c. to the requirements of an economical operation of the agreed services. 6. In the event the designated airlines of the Contracting Parties enter into a pooling arrangement in accordance with chapter XVI of the Convention, either Con- tracting Party may permit the other Contracting Party to exercise on the specified routes or any part thereof any of the rights exercised by its own designated airline. 7. The schedules of the services shall be submitted for approval to the aero- nautical authorities at least thirty (30) days before the date of their entry into force. Article 6. 1. Aircraft operated on international services by the designated airline of one Contracting Party, as well as their normal equipment, supplies of fuel and lubricants and aircraft stores, including food, beverages and tobacco, carried on board such aircraft shall, on entering into the territory of the other Contracting Party, be exempt from all customs duties, inspection fees and other duties or taxes, provided such equipment, supplies and stores remain on board the aircraft until they are re- exported. 2. There shall also be exempt from the same duties, fees and taxes, with the exception of charges corresponding to the services rendered: a. aircraft stores taken on board in the territory of one Contracting Party, within the limits fixed by the Authorities of the said Contracting Party, and intended for use on board aircraft operated on an international service by the designated airline of the other Contracting Party; b. spare parts and normal on board equipment imported into the territory of one of the Contracting Parties for the maintenance or repair of aircraft operated on interna- tional services; c. fuel and lubricants destined for the designated airline of the other Contracting Party to supply aircraft operated on international services, even when these supplies are to be used on the part of the journey performed over the territory of the Contracting Party in which they have been taken on board. 3. Materials referred to in sub-paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) above may be required to be kept under customs supervision or control. 4. The normal on board equipment, as well as the materials and supplies retained on board the aircraft operated by the designated airline of one Contracting Party may be unloaded in the territory of the other Contracting Party only with the approval of the 13463 1974 United Nations -Treaty Series e Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitis 241 customs authorities of such a territory. In such a case, they may be placed under the supervision of the said authorities until they are re-exported or otherwise disposed of in accordance with customs regulations. Article 7. Passengers, baggage and cargo in transit across the territory of one Contracting Party and not leaving the area of the airport reserved for such purpose shall only be subject to a very simplified control. Baggage and cargo in direct transit shall be exempt from customs duties and other similar taxes. Article 8. 1. The laws, regulations and procedures of one Contracting Party governing entry into and departure from its territory ofaircraft engaged in international air navigation or flights of such aircraft over that territory shall apply to the designated airline of the other Contracing Party. 2. The laws and regulations of one Contracting Party governing entry into, sojourn in, and departure from its territory of passengers, crew, cargo or mail, such as formal- ities regarding entry, exit, emigration and immigration, as well as customs and sanitary measures shall apply to passengers, crew, cargo or mail carried by the aircraft of the designated airline of the other Contracting Party while they are within the said terri- tory. 3. Each Contracting Party undertakes not to grant any preferences to its own airlines with regard to the designated airline of the other Contracting Party in the application of the laws and regulations provided for by the present article. 4. When utilizing the airports and other facilities offered by one Contracting Party, the designated airline of the other Contracting Party shall not have to pay fees higher than those which have to be paid by national aircraft operating on scheduled international services. 5. The designated airline of one Contracting Party shall have the right to maintain representations in the territory of the other Contracting Party. These representations may include commercial, operational and technical staff. Article 9. 1. Certificates of airworthiness, certificates of competency and licences issued or rendered valid by one of the Contracting Parties shall, during the period of their validity, be recognised as valid by the other Contracting Party. 2. Each Contracting Party reserves its rights, however, to refuse to recognise as valid, for the purpose of flights over its own territory, certificates of competency and licences granted to its own nationals or rendered valid for them by the other Contract- ing Party or by any other State. Article 10. 1. The tariffs on any agreed service shall be established at reasonable levels, due regard being paid to all relevant factors including cost of operation, rea- sonable profit, the characteristics of each service and the tariffs charged by other airlines. 2. The tariffs referred to in paragraph 1 of the present article shall, if possible, be established by mutual agreement by the designated airlines of both Contracting Parties and after consultation with the other airlines operating over the whole or part of the same route. The designated airlines shall, wherever possible, reach such an agreement through the rate-fixing procedure established by the international body which formu- lates proposals in this matter. 3. The tariffs so agreed shall be submitted for approval to the aeronautical auth- orities of the Contracting Parties at least thirty (30) days before the proposed date of 13463 242 United Nations -Treaty Series e Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitis 1974 their introduction. In special cases, this time limit may be reduced, subject to the agreement of the said authorities. 4. If the designated airlines cannot agree, or if the tariffs are not approved by the aeronautical authorities of one Contracting Party, the aeronautical authorities of both Contracting Parties shall endeavour to determine the tariffs by mutual agreement. 5. In default of agreement the dispute shall be submitted to arbitration as pro- vided for in article 15 hereafter. 6. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3 of this article no tariff shall come into force if the aeronautical authorities of either Contracting Party have not approved it. 7. The tariffs already established shall remain in force until new tariffs have been fixed in accordance with the provisions of this article or article 15 of the present Agreement but not longer than twelve (12) months from the day of disapproval by the aeronautical authorities of one of the Contracting Parties. Article 11. Each Contracting Party undertakes to guarantee to the designated airline of the other Contracting Party free transfer, at the official rate of exchange, of the excess of receipts over expenditure realised in its territory in due proportion to the carriage of passengers, baggage, cargo and mail by the said designated airline. If pay- ments between the Contracting Parties are regulated by a special agreement, this special agreement shall apply. Article 12. The aeronautical authorities of the Contracting Parties shall supply each other, on request, with periodic statistics or other similar information relating to the amount of traffic carried on the agreed services. Article 13. 1. Each Contracting Party or its aeronautical authorities may consult with the other Contracting Party or with its aeronautical authorities with a view of ensuring the implementation of, and satisfactory compliance with, the provisions of the present Agreement and the annex thereto. 2. A consultation requested by one of the Contracting Parties or their aeronautical authorities shall begin within a period of sixty (60) days of the date of receipt of the request. Article 14. 1. Any modification of the present Agreement shall enter into force when the two Contracting Parties will have notified to each other the fulfilment of their constitutional procedures relating to the conclusion and the entering into force of international agreements. 2. Modifications to the annex of the present Agreement may be agreed directly between the aeronautical authorities of the Contracting Parties. They shall enter into force after having been confirmed by an exchange of diplomatic notes. Article 15. 1. Any dispute between the Contracting Parties relating to the inter- pretation or application of the present Agreement, which cannot be settled by direct negotiations or through diplomatic channels, shall, on the request of either Contracting Party, be submitted to an arbitral tribunal composed of three members. 2. In such a case, each Contracting Party shall nominate an arbitrator and the two arbitrators shall appoint a third arbitrator, national of a third State, as president. If within a period of two months from the date one of the Contracting Parties has nominated an arbitrator, the other Contracting Party has not nominated its own, or, if within the month following the nomination of the second arbitrator, the arbitrators so 13463 1974 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traites 243 nominated have not agreed on the appointment of the president, each Contracting Party may request the President of the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization to proceed with the necessary nominations. 3. The arbitral tribunal shall determine its own procedure and decide on the distribution of the cost of the procedure. 4. The Contracting Parties undertake to comply with any decision delivered in application of the present article. Article 16. The present Agreement and its possible modifications shall be regis- tered with the International Civil Aviation Organization. Article 17. The present Agreement and its annex shall be amended so as to be in accordance with any multilateral convention which may become binding on both Contracting Parties. Article 18. 1. Each Contracting Party may at any time notify to the other Con- tracting Party its decision to terminate the present Agreement; such notification shall simultaneously be communicated to the International Civil Aviation Organization. 2. The notice of termination shall become effective at the termination of the time-table period during which a period of twelve (12) months will have elapsed, unless it is withdrawn by mutual agreement before this period expires. 3. In default of acknowledgement of receipt by the other Contracting Party, the notification shall be deemed to have been received fourteen (14) days after the date on which the International Civil Aviation Organization will have received communica- tion thereof. Article 19. The present Agreement shall be applied provisionally from the date of its signature; it shall enter into force when the Contracting Parties will have reciprocally notified the fulfilment of their constitutional formalities with regard to the conclusion and the entering into force of international agreements. 13463 244 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traites Trinit6-et-Tobago, consid6rant que la Suisse et Trinit6-et-Tobago Convention rela- tive A I'aviation civile internationale, ouverte i la le d6cembre 19442, d6sireux de d6velopper la coop6ration internationale du transport a6rien, et d6sireux de conclure un accord en Article Accord et de son annexe: a.

The Contracting Parties shall grant each other the rights specified in this Agreement for the purpose of establishing air services on the routes specified in the schedules in the annex to this Agreement. Such services and routes are hereinafter called \"agreed services\" and \"specified routes\". 2. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the designated airline of each Contracting Party shall, while operating international services, enjoy: (a) the right to fly, without landing, across the territory of the other Contracting Party; (b) the right to make stops in the said territory, for non-traffic purposes; (c) the right to take on and put down in the said territory, at points specified in the annex, international traffic in passengers, cargo and mail. Article 11. 1. Each Contracting Party shall have the right to designate an airline to operate the agreed services. Such designation shall form the subject of a written notification between the aeronautical authorities of the two Contracting Parties. 2. The Contracting Party which has received the notification of designation shall, subject to the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 of this article, without delay, grant to the airline designated by the other Contracting Party the necessary authorization to operate. 3. The aeronautical authorities of one Contracting Party may require the airline designated by the other Contracting Party to furnish proof that it is able to fulfil the conditions prescribed by the laws and regulations normally applied by the said auth- orities to the operation of international air services in accordance with the provisions of the Convention. 4. Each Contracting Party shall have the right not to grant the operating auth- orization provided for in paragraph 2 of this article or to impose such conditions as it may deem necessary for the exercise, by the designated airline, of the rights specified in article 10 of this Agreement, when the said Contracting Party is not satisfied that substantial ownership and effective control of such airline is vested in the Contracting Party which has designated the airline or its nationals. 5. Upon receipt of the operating authorization provided for in paragraph 2 of this article, the designated airline may, subject to article 16, paragraph 1, of this Agreement, begin at any time to operate any agreed service, provided that a tariff established in accordance with the provisions of article 17 of this Agreement is in force in respect of such service. Article 12. 1. Each Contracting Party shall have the right to revoke the operating authorization or to suspend the exercise of the rights specified in article 10 of this Agreement by the airline designated by the other Contracting Party or to impose such conditions as it may deem necessary on the exercise of such rights if: (a) it is not satisfied that substantial ownership and effective control of the airline are vested in the Contracting Party designating the airline or in its nationals, or 13464 1974 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitis 267 (b) that airline has failed to comply with the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party which has granted those rights, or (c) that airline fails to operate the agreed services in accordance with the conditions prescribed in this Agreement and its annex. 2. Unless the revocation, suspension or imposition of conditions referred to in paragraph I of this article is immediately imperative in order to prevent further infringement of the laws and regulations, such right may be exercised only after con- sultation with the other Contracting Party. Article 13. Notwithstanding the provisions of article 11, paragraph 4, and article 12, paragraph 1 (a), of this Agreement, either Contracting Party may designate a joint airline constituted in accordance with articles 77 and 79 of the Convention, and such airline shall be accepted by the other Contracting Party. Article 14. 1. The operation of the agreed services between the territories of the two Contracting Parties constitutes a fundamental and primary right of the two coun- tries. 2. The airlines designated by the two Contracting Parties shall be assured of fair and equitable treatment in order to enjoy equal opportunity to operate the agreed services. 3. They shall take account of their mutual interests on shared routes so as not to affect unduly their respective services. Article 15. 1. On any of the specified routes, the agreed services shall have as their primary objective the provision, at a reasonable load factor, of a capacity adapted to the normal and reasonably foreseeable requirements of international air traffic to or from the territory of the Contracting Party which has designated the airline operating the said services. 2. However, the airline designated by one Contracting Party may satisfy traffic requirements between the territories of third States along the specified routes and the territory of the other Contracting Party, taking into account local and regional services. 3. In order to satisfy unforeseen or temporary traffic requirements on these same routes, the designated airlines shall consult with each other regarding appropriate measures to meet the temporary increase in traffic. The result of such consultations shall be submitted to the Aeronautical Authorities of the two Contracting Parties for their approval. 4. Should the airline designated by one of the Contracting Parties not wish to operate, on one or more of the routes, all or part of the transport capacity that it could provide under paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this article, it shall consult with the airline designated by the other Contracting Party with a view to transferring to the latter, for a definite period, all or part of the transport capacity in question. Article 16. 1. The designated airlines shall communicate to the Aeronautical Authorities of both Contracting Parties, not later than thirty (30) days prior to the inauguration of the agreed services, the type of service, the types of aircraft to be used and the anticipated flight schedules. This rule shall likewise apply to later changes. 2. The Aeronautical Authorities of the Contracting Parties shall communicate to each other, on request, periodic statistics or other similar information relating to the volume of traffic carried on the agreed services according to points of embarkation and disembarkation. 13464 268 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Trait6s 1974 Article 17. 1. The tariffs on all agreed services shall be fixed at reasonable levels, due regard being paid to all relevant factors, including cost of operation, reasonable profit, the characteristics of each service and the tariffs of other airlines. 2. The tariffs referred to in paragraph 1 ofthis article shall, if possible, be agreed by the designated airlines of both Contracting Parties, in consultation with other airlines operating over the whole or part of the route concerned. The designated airlines shall, where possible, reach such agreement through the rate-fixing machinery established by the international agency which puts forward proposals in this respect. 3. The tariffs so established shall be submitted to the Aeronautical Authorities of the Contracting Parties for approval not less than thirty (30) days before the date proposed for thier introduction. In special cases, this period may be reduced, subject to the agreement of the said Authorities. 4. If the designated airlines are unable to reach agreement or if the tariffs are not approved by the Aeronautical Authorities of one Contracting Party, the Aeronautical Authorities of both Contracting Parties shall endeavour to fix the tariff by agreement between themselves. 5. Failing agreement, the dispute shall be settled by arbitration as provided in article 9 above. 6. Tariffs already established shall remain in force until new tariffs are fixed in accordance with the provisions of this article or of article 9 of this Agreement, but no longer than twelve (12) months from the date on which the Aeronautical Authorities of one of the Contracting Parties refused approval. III. FINAL PROVISIONS Article 18. This Agreement and its annex shall be registered with the Interna- tional Civil Aviation Organization. Article 19.

In war areas or areas under military occupation or in the regions affected by such operations, the operation of the agreed services shall be subject to the approval of the competent military authorities.

Aircraft operated on international services by the designated airline of one Contracting Party, as well as supplies of fuels, lubricants, other fungible technical supplies, spare parts, regular equipment and aircraft stores remaining on the aircraft of the said airline which is authorized to operate the routes and services specified in this Agreement shall, subject to reciprocity, be exempt upon arriving in or departing from the territory of the other Contracting Party from customs duties, inspection fees and other national duties or taxes, even if such supplies are used or consumed by such aircraft in flight over the said territory. 2. Fuels, lubricants, fungible technical supplies, spare parts, regular equipment and stores imported into the territory of one Contracting Party by the other Contracting Party or its nationals and to be used exclusively by the aircraft of the said Contracting Party shall, subject to reciprocity, be exempt from customs duties, inspection fees and other national duties or taxes. 3.

AIRPORT CHARGES AND CHARGES FOR FACILITIES AND SERVICES Each Contracting Party may impose or authorize the imposition of fair and reasonable charges for the use of the airports and other facilities and services for which it is responsible. Each Contracting Party agrees, however, that such charges shall not be greater than those which would be paid, for such airports and such facilities and services, by national aircraft engaged in similar international services. Article 8. PROVISIONS CONCERNING CAPACITY AND APPROVAL OF FLIGHT SCHEDULES 1. The designated airlines of the two Contracting Parties shall receive equal and fair treatment, so that they may have equal possibilities to operate the agreed services on the specified routes. 2. In operating the agreed services, the designated airline of each Contracting Party shall take into account the interests of the airline of the other Contracting Party, so as not to affect unduly the services which the latter provides on the whole or part of the same routes. 3. The agreed services provided by the designated airlines of the Contracting Parties shall have as their primary objective the provision, at a reasonable load factor, of transport capacity suited to the current and reasonably anticipated traffic require- ments for passengers, cargo and mail between the territory of the Contracting Party designating the airline and the territory of the other Contracting Party. 4. Subject to the principles stated in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this article, the designated airline of one Contracting Party may also provide a capacity corresponding to traffic requirements between the territory of the third countries listed in the route schedule annexed to this Agreement and the territory of the other Contracting Party. 5. The capacity provided, including the frequency of the services and the type of aircraft used by the designated airlines of the Contracting Parties on the agreed services, shall be subject to the approval of the aeronautical authorities, on the recommendation of the designated airlines. The designated airlines shall make such recommendation after duly consulting each other, taking into account the principles stated in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this article. 6. In the event of disagreement between the designated airlines of the Contracting Parties, the questions mentioned in paragraph 5 above shall be settled by agreement between the aeronautical authorities of the two Contracting Parties. Until such agree- ment has been reached, the capacity offered by the designated airlines shall remain unchanged. 7. The designated airline of each Contracting Party shall submit the flight schedules for the approval of the aeronautical authorities of the other Contracting Party at least 30 days before the introduction of services on the specified routes. In the event of subsequent changes, the same procedure shall be followed. In individual cases, this period may be reduced if the said authorities so agree. Article 9. RECOGNITION OF CERTIFICATES AND LICENCES Certificates of airworthiness, certificates of competency and licences issued or validated by one Contracting Party shall be recognized as valid by the other Contract- ing Party, if they are still in force, for the operation of the routes and services specified in this Agreement, provided that the conditions in which such certificates or licences 13465 1974 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traites 299 have been issued or validated are equal to or above the minimum standards which have been or may be set in accordance with the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation, of 7 December 1944. Each Contracting Party reserves the right, however, to refuse to recognize, for the purpose of flight over its territory, certificates of competency and licences issued to or validated for its own nationals by the other Contracting Party or by any other State. Article 10. AIR TRANSPORT TARIFFS 1. The tariffs to be charged by the airlines of the Contracting Parties for the agreed services shall be established at reasonable rates, taking duly into consideration all determining factors, including cost of operation, reasonable profit, the characteristics of the services and the tariffs charged by the other airlines operating regular services over the same route or parts thereof. 2. The tariffs mentioned in paragraph 1 of this article shall be established accord- ing to the following rules: (a) When the designated airlines of the two Contracting Parties are members of an international airline association which has its own tariff-fixing procedure and when a decision on the tariffs to be charged for the agreed services already exists, the tariffs shall be established by agreement between the designated airlines of the Contracting Parties, in accordance with that decision on tariffs; (b) When no decision has been taken on the tariffs to be charged for the agreed services, or when one or both of the two designated airlines of the Contracting Parties are not members of the same association mentioned in paragraph (a) above, the designated airlines of the Contracting Parties shall themselves establish by mutual agreement the tariffs to be charged for the agreed services; (c) The tariffs so established shall be submitted for approval to the aeronautical authorities of the Contracting Parties not later than 30 days prior to the proposed date of their entry into force; this period may be reduced if the said authorities so agree; (d) If the designated airlines of the Contracting Parties fail to agree on the tariffs to be charged, or one Contracting Party has not designated its airline to operate the agreed services, or if during the first 15 days of the 30-day period mentioned in paragraph (c) of this article the aeronautical authorities of one Contracting Party express to the aeronautical authorities of the other Contracting Party their disap- proval of the tariffs established by the designated airlines of the Contracting Parties in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) ofthis article, the aeronautical authorities of the Contracting Parties shall endeavour to reach agreement on the appropriate tariffs to be charged; no tariff shall enter into force, however, if the aeronautical authorities of either Contracting Party have not approved it. 3. The tariffs established in accordance with the provisions of this article shall remain in force until new tariffs have been established in accordance with the pro- visions of this article. Article 11. PROVISION OF STATISTICS The aeronautical authorities of one of the Contracting Parties shall provide to the aeronautical authorities of the other Contracting Party at their request the information and statistics concerning the traffic carried on the agreed services by the designated airline of the former Contracting Party to and from the territory of the other Con- 13465 300 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitis 1974 tracting Party, in the manner in which such information and statistics are normally prepared and submitted by the designated airline to its national aeronautical auth- orities. Any additional statistical data concerning traffic which the aeronautical authorities of one Contracting Party may wish to obtain from the aeronautical autho- rities of the other Contracting Party shall, upon request, be the subject of discussions and mutual agreements between the two Contracting Parties. Article 12. CONSULTATIONS AND MODIFICATIONS 1. Each Contracting Party or its aeronautical authorities may at any time request a consultation with the other Contracting Party or with its aeronautical authorities. 2. A consultation requested by one of the Contracting Parties or its aeronautical authorities shall begin within sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of the request. 3. Any modification of this Agreement shall enter into force when the two Con- tracting Parties have informed each other of the completion of their constitutional formalities concerning the conclusion and entry into force of international agree- ments. 4. Modifications of the annex to this Agreement may be agreed upon directly by the aeronautical authorities of the Contracting Parties. They shall enter into force after they have been confirmed by an exchange of notes through the diplomatic channel. Article 13. SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES 1. In the event of a dispute between the Contracting Parties concerning the inter- pretation or application of this Agreement, the Contracting Parties shall in the first place endeavour to settle it by negotiation. 2. If the Contracting Parties fail to reach a settlement by negotiation, they may agree to submit the dispute to a person or body for consultation. 3. If the Contracting Parties fail to reach a settlement in accordance with para- graphs I and 2 above, the dispute shall be submitted to a tribunal of three members, one to be nominated by each Contracting Party and the third to be appointed by the two so nominated. Each Contracting Party shall nominate an arbitrator within a period of sixty days from the date of receipt by one of the Contracting Parties from the other of a notice through diplomatic channels requesting arbitration of the dispute by such a tribunal, and the third arbitrator shall be appointed within a further period of sixty days. If either of the Contracting Parties fails to nominate an arbitrator within the period specified, the other Contracting Party may request the President of the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization to appoint an arbitrator or arbitrators as the case requires; if the President of the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization is a national of one of the Contracting Parties, the first Vice-President of the Council or, if he too is a national of one of the Contracting Parties, the senior member of the Council who is not such a national shall be requested to make the necessary appointment or appointments. In any case, the third arbitrator shall be a national of a third State and shall act as president of the arbitral tribunal. 4. The arbitral tribunal shall determine its own procedure and decide on the apportionment of the expenses resulting from that procedure. 5. The Contracting Parties undertake to comply with any decision given under this article. 13465 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitis Article 14. DENUNCIATION Each Contracting Party may at any time give notice to the other Contracting Party of its intention to terminate this Agreement; such notice shall be simultaneously communicated to the International Civil Aviation Organization. In such case the Agreement shall terminate twelve months after the date of receipt of the notice by the other Contracting Party, unless the notice of denunciation is withdrawn by agreement before the expiry of this period. In the absence of acknowledgement of receipt by the other Contracting Party, notice shall be deemed to have been received fourteen days after the receipt of the notice by the International Civil Aviation Organization.

The tariffs so agreed shall be subject to the approval of the aeronautical authorities of both Contracting Parties. 13466 United Nations -Treaty Series e Nations Unies -Recueil des Traites (3) If the designated airlines cannot agree on any of these tariffs, or if for some other reason a tariff cannot be agreed upon in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (2) of this article, the aeronautical authorities of the Contracting Parties shall try to determine the tariff by agreement between themselves. (4) If the aeronautical authorities cannot agree on the approval of any tariff sub- mitted to them under paragraph (2) of this article or on the determination of any tariff under paragraph (3), the dispute shall be settled in accordance with the provisions of article 13 of the present Agreement.

(2) Subject to the provisions of the present Agreement, the airlines designated by each Contracting Party shall enjoy, while operating an agreed service on a specified route, the following privileges: (a) To fly without landing across the territory of the other Contracting Party; (b) To make stops in the said territory for non-traffic purposes; and (c) To make stops in the said territory at the points specified for that route in the schedule in the annex to the present Agreement for the purpose of setting down and taking on international traffic in passengers, cargo and mail. Article 3. (1) Each Contracting Party shall have the right to designate in writing to the other Contracting Party one or more airlines for the purpose of operating the agreed services on the specified routes. (2) On receipt of the written notification of the designation, the other Contracting Party shall, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (3) and (4) of this article, without delay grant to the designated airline or airlines the appropriate operating authoriza- tion. (3) The aeronautical authorities of one Contracting Party may require the airline designated by the other Contracting Party to satisfy them that it is qualified to fulfil the conditions prescribed under the laws and regulations of the other Contracting Party normally and reasonably applied by it to the operation of international commercial air services, in so far as those laws and regulations are not contrary to the Convention. (4) Each Contracting Party have the right to refuse to accept the designation of an airline and to withhold or revoke the grant to an airline of the privileges specified in article 2, paragraph (2), of the present Agreement or to impose such conditions as it may deem necessary on the exercise by an airline of those rights in any case where it is not satisfied that substantial ownership and effective control of that airline are vested in the Contracting Party designating the airline or in nationals of the Contracting Party designating the airline. (5) Any time after the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this article have been complied with, an airline so designated and authorized may begin to operate the agreed services, provided that a service shall not be operated unless a tariff established in accordance with the provisions of article 8 of the present Agreement is in force in respect of that service. (6) Each Contracting Party shall have the right to suspend the exercise by an airline of the privileges specified in article 2, paragraph (2), of the present Agreement or to impose such conditions as it may deem necessary on the exercise by the airline of those privileges in any case where the airline fails to comply with the laws and regu- lations of the Contracting Party granting those privileges or otherwise fails to operate in accordance with the provisions of the present Agreement provided that, unless imme- diate suspension or imposition of conditions is essential to prevent further infringe- ments of the said laws and regulations, this right shall be exercised only after consul- tation with the other Contracting Party. (7) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this article and in application of articles 77 and 79 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation 13467 1974 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traits 337 concerning the establishment by two or more States ofjoint operating organizations or international operating agencies, the Government of the Republic of Mali and the Government of the Republic of Chad acknowledge that each has the right to designate a joint airline established by each of them and other States to operate agreed services. Article 4. (1) The aircraft used by the designated airlines of either of the Con- tracting Parties and introduced into the territory of the other Contracting Party, as well as fuel, lubricating oil, spare parts, aircraft stores and general equipment exclusively for use by the said aircraft, shall be exempt from customs duties and other fees and taxes levied on goods upon entering and leaving the territory. (2) Fuel and lubricating oil taken on board the said aircraft by the designated airline in the territory of the other Contracting Party and re-exported shall remain exempt from customs duties, consumption duties and other fees and national taxes.

(3) The agreed services provided by the designated airlines of the Contracting Parties shall bear a close relationship to the requirements of the public for transpor- tation on the specified routes and shall have as their primary objective the provision, at a reasonable load factor, of capacity adequate to carry the current and reasonably anticipated requirements for the carriage of passengers, cargo and mail originating from or destined for the territory of the Contracting Party which had designated the airline. Provision for the carriage of passengers, cargo and mail both taken on and set down at points on the specified routes in the territories of States other than that designating the airline shall be made in accordance with the general principles requiring that capacity shall be related to: (a) Traffic requirements between the country of origin and the country of destina- tion; 13467 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traites (b) Traffic requirements of the region through which the airline passes, after taking account of other transport services established by airlines of the States comprising the region; and (c) The requirements of through airline operation. Article 8. (1) The tariffs on any agreed service shall be established at reasonable levels, due regard being paid to all relevant factors, including cost of operation, reasonable profit, characteristics of service (such as standards of speed and accommo- dation) and the tariffs of other airlines operating over the same specified routes.

(2) The tariffs referred toin paragraph (1) of this article, together with the rates of agency commission used in conjunction with them shall, if possible, be agreed in respect of each of the specified routes between the designated airlines concerned, in consultation with other airlines operating over the whole or part of that route, and such agreement shall, where possible, be reached through the rate-fixing machinery of the International Air Transport Association (IATA). The tariffs so agreed shall be subject to the approval of the aeronautical authorities of both Contracting Parties at least thirty (30) days before the date proposed for their entry into force. (3) If the airlines cannot agree on any of these tariffs or if for some other reason a tariff cannot be agreed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (2) of this article, the aeronautical authorities of the Contracting Parties shall try to determine the tariffs by agreement between themselves. (4) Ifthe aeronautical authorities cannot agree on the approval of any tariffs under paragraph (2) of this article, or on the determination of any tariffs under paragraph (3), the dispute shall be settled in accordance with the provisions of article 12 of the present Agreement. (5) No tariff shall come into force if the aeronautical authorities of either Con- tracting Party are dissatisfied with it, except under the provisions of article 12 of the present Agreement. (6) When tariffs have been established in accordance with the provisions of this article these tariffs shall remain in force until new tariffs have been established in accordance with the provisions of this article.

Such consultation shall begin within a period of thirty (30) days from the date of the request and shall end within sixty (60) days from the date on which it began. (2) All decisions taken in accordance with such consultations shall enter into force when they have been confirmed by an exchange of diplomatic notes. Article 13. (1) In the event that a dispute relating to the interpretation or appli- cation of the present Agreement has not been settled in accordance with the provisions of article 12, either by the aeronautical authorities or by the. Governments of the Contracting Parties, it shall be referred to an arbitral tribunal at the request of one of the Contracting Parties. (2) The tribunal shall be composed of three members. Each of the two Govern- ments shall appoint its arbitrators; these two arbitrators shall agree on the appointment of a national of a third State as President. (3) If within a period of sixty (60) days from the day on which one of the two Governments proposed the settlement of the dispute by arbitration the arbitrators have not reached agreement on the appointment of a President, each Contracting Party may request the President of the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organi- zation to make the necessary appointments. (4) The Contracting Parties undertake to comply with any interim measures decreed during the proceedings and with the arbitral decision, which shall be deemed final in all cases. (5) Each Contracting Party shall be responsible for the cost of its designated arbitrator and subsidiary staff provided, and both Contracting Parties shall share equally all such further expenses involved in the activities of the tribunal, including those of the President. (6) If and so long as either Contracting Party or the designated airline of either Contracting Party fails to comply with a decision given under this article, the other Contracting Party may limit, withhold or revoke any rights or privileges which it has granted by virtue of the present Agreement to the Contracting Party in default or to the designated airline or airlines of that Contracting Party or to the designated airline in default. Article 14. Each contracting Party may at any time notify the other Contracting Party in writing and through the diplomatic channel of its decision to terminate the present transport Agreement. Such notice shall simultaneously be transmitted to the International Civil Aviation Organization. If such notice is given, the present Agree- ment shall be terminated twelve (12) months after the date of receipt of the notice by the other contracting Party, unless the notice to terminate is withdrawn by mutual agree- ment before the expiry of this period. In the absence of acknowledgement of receipt by the other Contracting Party, the notice shall be deemed to have been received fourteen (14) days after the receipt of the notice by the International Civil Aviation Organiza- tion.

(2) The laws and regulations of a Contracting Party as to the admission to or departure from its territory of passengers, crew or cargo of aircraft, such as regulations relating to entry, clearance, immigration, passports, customs and quarantine shall be complied with by or on behalf of the passengers, crew, or cargo of the designated airlines of the other Contracting Party upon entrance into or departure from, or while within the territory of the first Contracting Party. (3) Neither of the Contracting Parties shall give a preference to its own or any other airline over the designated airline or airlines of the other Contracting Party engaged in operating an agreed service in the application of its customs, immigration, quarantine and similar regulations or in the use of airports, airways and air traffic services and associated facilities under its control. (4) The provisions of this article are without prejudice to the obligation of the airlines of one Contracting Party and of their aircraft, passengers, crew and cargo to comply with all the laws and regulations of the other Contracting Party. Article 8. AIRWORTHINESS AND PERSONNEL LICENSING (1) Certificates of airworthiness and certificates of competency and licences issued or rendered valid by one Contracting Party (and still in force) shall be recognized as valid by the other Contracting Party for the purpose of operating the agreed services, provided that the requirements under which such certificates or licences were issued or rendered valid are equal to or above the minimum standards which may be established from time to time pursuant to the Convention. Each Contracting Party reserves the 13468 1974 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitis 347 right, however, to refuse to recognize, for the purpose of flight above its own territory, certificates of competency and licences granted to any of its own nationals by the other Contracting Party. (2) If one Contracting Party has notified the International Civil Aviation Orga- nization of a difference between the requirements under which it issues such certificates or licences or renders them valid and the minimum standards that may be established under the Convention, the aeronautical authorities of the other Contracting Party may request consultations with those of the first Contracting Party with a view to satisfying themselves that the difference in question is acceptable to them. If following the consultations they are not so satisfied, they may take action against a designated airline of the first Contracting Party under article 6 of the Agreement, without prejudice to the right of the first Contracting Party to refer the dispute for settlement under article 17 of the Agreement. Article 9. AIRPORT AND OTHER CHARGES Any charges that may be imposed or permitted to be imposed by one Contracting Party for the use, by the aircraft of a designated airline of the other Contracting Party engaged in operating an agreed service, both of airports which are open to public use by its national aircraft and of other aviation facilities provided for public use shall not be higher than those that would be paid by its national aircraft engaged in similar inter- national air services. Article 10. CUSTOMS REGULATIONS (1) Aircraft operated on international air services by a designated airline of either Contracting Party, as well as the regular equipment, supplies of fuel and lubricants, consumable technical supplies, and aircraft stores (including food, liquor and tobacco) on board such aircraft, and other items intended for use solely in connection with the operation or servicing of such aircraft, shall be exempt from all customs duties, excise taxes, inspection fees, and similar duties and charges on arriving in the territory of the other Contracting Party, on the following conditions: (i) that such equipment and supplies remain on board the aircraft up to such time as they are re-exported or are used on the part of the journey performed over that territory; or (ii) that such equipment and supplies may be unloaded, subject to compliance with the customs regulations of that territory, in which case they may be placed under the control of the customs authorities up to such time as they are re-exported or otherwise disposed of in accordance with those regulations. (2) Each Contracting Party shall also exempt from the same duties, fees and charges, with the exception of charges corresponding to the service performed, the following items, whether or not they have been imported into its territory: (a) aircraft stores and other items intended for use solely in connection with the operation or servicing of aircraft, taken on board in its territory, within limits fixed by its authorities, and for use on board an aircraft of a designated airline of the other Contracting Party engaged in an international air service; (b) fuel and lubricants supplied in its territory to an aircraft of a designated airline of the other Contracting Party engaged in an international air service, even when these supplies are to be used on the part of the journey performed over the territory of the Contracting Party in which they are taken on board; 13468 348 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traitis 1974 (c) spare parts, including engines, intended for the maintenance or repair of aircraft of a designated airline of the other Contracting Party engaged in an international air service; and (d) equipment (including specialised ground equipment), intended for incorporation in or use on aircraft of a designated airline of the other Contracting Party engaged on an international air service, or for use solely in connection with the operation or servicing of such aircraft. The items referred to in this paragraph may be required to be kept under customs supervision or control. Article 11. PRINCIPLES GOVERNING OPERATION OF AGREED SERVICES (1) There shall be fair and equal opportunity for the designated airlines of both Contracting Parties to operate the agreed services on the specified routes. (2) In operating the agreed services, the designated airline or airlines of each Contracting Party shall take into account the interests of the airlines of the other Contracting Party so as not to affect unduly the services which the latter provides on the whole or part of the same routes. (3) The agreed services provided by the designated airlines of each Contracting Party shall bear reasonable relationship to the requirements of the public for trans- portation on the specified routes and shall have as their primary objective the provi- sion, at a reasonable load factor, of capacity adequate to carry the current and reason- ably anticipated requirements for the carriage of passengers, cargo and mail originating from or destined for the territory of the Contracting Party which has designated the airline. (4) Provision for the carriage of passengers, cargo and mail both taken up and discharged at points on the specified routes in the territories of States other than that designating the airline shall be made in accordance with the general principle that capacity shall be related to: (a) traffic requirements to and from the territory of the Contracting Party which has designated the airline; (b) traffic requirements of the area through which the agreed service passes after taking account of other transport services established by airlines of the States comprising the area; and (c) the requirements of through airline operation. (5) The capacity that may be provided in accordance with this article by the designated airlines of each Contracting Party on an agreed service shall be such as may from time to time be agreed between the aeronautical authorities of the Contracting Parties. Subject to paragraph (6) of this article, and unless otherwise agreed between the aeronautical authorities, in operating the agreed capacity the designated airlines will be free to use their commercial judgement with respect to frequency and type of air- craft. (6) In the event that one of the Contracting Parties believes that the operation proposed or conducted by an airline of the other Contracting Party is inconsistent with the principles set out in this article it may without prejudice to the provisions of article 17 request consultations pursuant to article 16 of the Agreement. 13468 1974 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traites 349 Article 12. CHANGE OF GAUGE In operating any agreed service on any specified route a designated airline of one Contracting Party may substitute one aircraft for another at a point in the territory of the other Contracting Party on the following conditions only: (a) that it is justified by reason of economy of operation; (b) that the aircraft used on the section of the route more distant from the terminal in the territory of the first Contracting Party is not larger in capacity than that used on the nearer section; (c) that the aircraft used on the more distant section shall operate only in connection with and as an extension of the service provided by the aircraft used on the nearer section and shall be scheduled so to do; the former shall arrive at the point of change for the purpose of carrying traffic transferred from, or to be transferred into, the aircraft used on the nearer section; and its capacity shall be determined with primary reference to this purpose; (d) that there is an adequate volume of through traffic; (e) that the airline shall not hold itself out to the public by advertisement or otherwise as providing a service which originates at a point where the change of aircraft is made; (f) that the provisions of article 11 of this Agreement shall govern all arrangements made with regard to change of aircraft; (g) that in connection with any one aircraft flight into the territory in which the change of aircraft is made, only one flight may be made out of that territory. Article 13. TARiFFs (1) Tariffs to be charged by a designated airline of one Contracting Party for carriage to or from the territory of the other Contracting Party shall be established at a reasonable level, due regard being paid to all relevant factors, including cost of oper- ations, reasonable profit, characteristics of service (such as standard of speed and accommodation), and the tariffs of other airlines. (2) At such time as the agreed services are operated by designated airlines of both Contracting Parties, the tariffs referred to in paragraph (1) of this article shall be agreed upon between the designated airlines of the Contracting Parties; such agreement shall be reached, whenever possible, through the rate-fixing procedures of the International Air Transport Association. (3) Such tariffs shall be submitted to the aeronautical authorities of the Contrac- ting Parties at least forty-five (45) days before the proposed date of their introduction; in special cases, a shorter period may be accepted by the aeronautical authorities. If within thirty (30) days from the date of submission the aeronautical authorities of one Contracting Party have not notified the aeronautical authorities of the other Contrac- ting Party that they are dissatisfied with the tariff submitted to them, such tariff shall be considered to be acceptable and shall come into effect on the expiration of the forty-five (45) days period mentioned above. In the event that a shorter period for the submission of a tariff is accepted by the aeronautical authorities, they may also agree that the period for giving notice of dissatisfaction be less than thirty (30) days. (4) If a tariff cannot be established in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (2) above, or, if during the period applicable in accordance with paragraph (3) above a 13468 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traites notice of dissatisfaction has been given, the aeronautical authorities of the Contracting Parties shall endeavour to determine the tariff by agreement between themselves. (5) If the aeronautical authorities cannot agree on any tariff submitted to them under paragraph (3) of this article or on the determination of any tariff under paragraph (4), the dispute shall be settled in accordance with the provisions of article 17 of the Agreement. (6) (a) No tariff shall come into force if the aeronautical authorities of the Contracting Parties have been unable to reach agreement on it in accordance with this article except under the provisions of paragraph (3) of article 17 of the Agreement. (b) When tariffs have been established in accordance with the provisions of this article, those tariffs shall remain in force until new tariffs have been established in accordance with the provisions of this article. The aeronautical authorities of either Contracting Party, however, may give notice of the withdrawal of approval of an existing tariff and request consultation with the aeronautical authorities of the other Contracting Party for the purpose of reaching agreement on a new tariff. Pending agreement the existing tariff shall remain in effect. If agreement cannot be reached, however, the tariff shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of article 17 of the Agreement. Article 14. PROVISION OF STATISTICS The aeronautical authorities of a Contracting Party shall supply to the aeronautical authorities of the other Contracting Party at their request such periodic or other statements of statistics as may be reasonably required for the purpose of reviewing the capacity provided on the agreed services by a designated airline of the Contracting Party referred to first in this article. Such statements shall include all information required to determine the amount of traffic carried by the airline on the agreed services and the origins and destinations of such traffic. Article 15. TRANSFER OF EARNINGS Each Contracting Party grants to the designated airlines of the other Contracting Party the right of free transfer of the excess of their receipts in its territory over their expenditure therein. Such transfers shall be made on the basis of prevailing foreign exchange market rates for current payments and shall be subject only to the respective foreign currency regulations applicable to all countries in like circumstances, for the purpose of safeguarding the external financial position and balance of payments. The transfer of funds shall not be subject to any charges except those normally collected by banks for such operations. Article 16. CONSULTATION (1) In a spirit of close co-operation, the aeronautical authorities of the Contracting Parties shall consult each other from time to time with a view to promoting satisfactory air services and to ensuring the implementation of, and satisfactory compliance with, the provisions of this Agreement and the annexed schedule and shall consult when necessary to provide for modifications thereof. (2) Either Contracting Party may request consultations, which may be either oral or in writing and shall begin within a period of sixty (60) days of the date of receipt of the request, unless both Contracting Parties agree to an extension of this period. 13468 1974 United Nations -Treaty Series * Nations Unies -Recueil des Traites 351 Article 17. SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES (1) If any dispute arises between the Contracting Parties relating to the interpre- tation or application of the Agreement, the Contracting Parties shall in the first place endeavour to settle it by negotiation. (2) If the Contracting Parties fail to reach a settlement by negotiation, they may agree to refer the dispute for decision to some person or body; if they do not so agree, the dispute shall at the request of either Contracting Party be submitted for decision to a tribunal of three arbitrators, one to be nominated by each Contracting Party and the third to be appointed by the two so nominated. Each of the Contracting Parties shall nominate an arbitrator within a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt by either Contracting Party from the other of a notice through diplomatic channels requesting arbitration of the dispute by such a tribunal, and the third arbitrator shall be appointed within a further period of sixty (60) days. If either of the Contracting Parties fails to nominate an arbitrator within the period specified, or if the third arbitrator is not appointed within the period specified, the President of the Council of the Inter- national Civil Aviation Organization may at the request of either Contracting Party appoint an arbitrator or arbitrators as the case requires. In such case, the third arbi- trator shall be a national of a third State and shall act as president of the arbitral tribunal. (3) The Contracting Parties shall comply with any decision given under paragraph (2) of this article. (4) The expenses of the national arbitrators shall be borne by the respective Contracting Parties. All other expenses of the arbitral tribunal, including the fees and expenses of the third arbitrator, shall be shared equally by the Contracting Parties. Article 18. AMENDMENT If either of the Contracting Parties considers it desirable to modify any provision of this Agreement including the annexed schedule, such modification, if agreed be- tween the Contracting Parties and if necessary after consultation in accordance with article 16 of this Agreement, shall come into effect when confirmed by an exchange of notes, through the diplomatic channel. Article 19. TERMINATION Either Contracting Party may at any time give notice in writing through diplomatic channels to the other Contracting Party of its decision to terminate this Agreement; such notice shall be communicated simultaneously to the International Civil Aviation Organization. The Agreement shall terminate one (1) year after the date of receipt of the notice by the other Contracting Party, unless the notice to terminate is withdrawn by agreement before the expiry of this period. In the absence of acknowledgement of receipt by the other Contracting Party, the notice shall be deemed to have been received fourteen (14) days after the receipt of the notice by the International Civil Aviation Organization. Article 20. ENTRY INTO FORCE The Agreement shall enter into force on the date of the signature. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned, being duly authorised thereto by their res- pective Governments have signed the Agreement.

On the part of the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany I wish to confirm that, in accordance with those discussions, the Memorandum of Understanding of April 13, 1973, shall be amended as follows: (a) By the deletion from the first paragraph of the date March 31, 1974, and the substitution therefor of the date December 31, 1975, as well as the addition of the following new final sentence: \"If it is deemed necessary by one of the Parties, in the light of further experience, that Party may request a review of certain elements of the Memorandum of Understanding.\" (b) By the addition of two new subparagraphs to section I.D. as follows: \"4. accept as charterworthy 'advance charter' traffic organized and flown pursuant to a previously agreed rule which has been modified, temporarily or otherwise, to provide for an initial filing of passenger lists at least sixty days (rather than at least ninety days) in advance of flight departure. \"5. accept as charterworthy short-term 'advance charter' traffic organized and flown pursuant to a previously agreed rule to which exceptions have been made to provide for a maximum travel duration shorter than the minimum required, but subject to additional limitations.\" I United Nations, Treaty Series. vol. 916, p. 113. 1 Came into force on 12 March 1974, the date of the note in reply, in accordance with the provisions of the said notes. 3 The Federal Minister of Transport. 1974 United Nations -Treaty Series e Nations Unies -Recueil des Trait6s 387 (c) By the addition of a new section IV as follows: \"IV. Agreed Actions Relating to Other Types of Charters \"In addition, the regulatory authorities of each Party shall: \"A. Accept as charterworthy 'prior affinity' charter traffic organized and flown pur- suant to the extant rules of the aeronautical authorities of the other Party for so long as such rules are maintained by such Party, or for the term of this Understanding, whichever is shorter; provided, however, that the aeronautical authorities of the first Party may impose reasonable requirements to ensure bona fides, including the requirements that a list of all' persons who will or may be passengers* be supplied to them by the carrier at least 30 days in advance of each flight, subject to substitution and addition until flight departure of a rea- sonable number of other unlisted but bona fide group members under conditions to be agreed. \"B. Use their best efforts to accept as charterworthy charter flights of a 'Special Event' character organized in and flown from the territory of the other Party. \"C. Conduct any capacity surveillance of Inclusive Tour Charter flights (a type which supplements 'advance charters' or 'prior affinity' charters) which they may wish to undertake by setting a date, reasonably far in advance of each chartering season, by which time applicant carriers will normally be expected to file their Inclusive Tour Charter programs, and informing such carriers approximately one month thereafter of the acceptability of such programs. If such Party's regulatory authorities perceive a problem of program size, it will inform the other party reasonably in advance of final decision. \"D. Accept as charterworthy split charters, for traffic originating in the territory of the other Party, including split charters combining more than one charter type on the same aircraft, if such splitting is allowed under the rules of the country of origin.** \"By exception to their rules, the regulatory authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany will permit, on an ad hoc basis, the combining on the same aircraft of German- originating'civil U.S. military' charter traffic with other charter type traffic (except Inclusive Tour Charter).\" Moreover, I would like to point expressly to the statements which are contained in my letter of 13 April 1973, paras. 1-5. These principles are still valid for my Government as you know from the negotiations which took place in Bonn on 28/29 January 1974. I have the honor to propose that this letter and your letter in reply confirming that the Government of the United States of America agrees to the foregoing amendment of the Memo- randum of Understanding shall constitute an agreement between our two Governments which shall enter into force on the date of your letter of confirmation.
