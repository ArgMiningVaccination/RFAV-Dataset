Alberto d'Onofrio1and Piero Manfredi2 February 6, 2010 1Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute Via Ridol 4, Pisa, Italy. Abstract For infections for which the perceived risk of serious disease is steadily low, the perceived risk of suering some vaccine side eects might become the driving force of the vaccine demand. We investigate the dynamics of SIR infections in homogeneously mixing populations where the vaccine uptake is a decreasing function of the current (or past) incidence, or prevalence, of vaccine side eects. We dene an appropriate model where vaccine side-eects are modelled as functions of the age since vaccination.It happens that the vaccine uptake follows its own dynamics independent of epidemiological variables. We show the conditions under which the vaccine uptake lands on a globally stable equilibrium, or steadily oscillates, and the implications of such behaviour for the dynamics ofepidemiological variables. We nally report some unexpected scenarios caused by trends in vaccine side eects. Keywords: Vaccine, side eects, rational exemption to vaccination, information, delay, stability, oscillations. 1 Introduction The high degree of herd immunity allowed by sustained vaccination policies in many countries have gradually forced the perceived risk of infection from a wide spectrum of diseases to decline to negligible levels. The obvious drawback of this situation is that, despite the high degree of safety of currentvaccines, the existence of any, however small, risks of vaccine side-eects (VSE) [32], necessarily yields, given the very large numbers of vaccines administered annually, a steady flow of VSE. According tothe WHO denition VSE are a subset of the larger family of adverse events following immunisation: \"Adverse events following immunization are dened as medical incidents that take place after an im- munization, cause concern and are believed to be caused by immunization. Immunization can cause adverse events from the inherent properties of the vaccine (vaccine reaction), or some error in the im- munization process (programme error). The event may also be totally unrelated to the immunization and only have a temporal association.\" [34] For instance in the US approximately 30,000 reports ofVaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) are notied each year, with 10-15% classied as serious, i.e. causing disability, hospitalization, life-threatening illness or death [7]. In such circumstances it is natural to expect that the perceived risk of experiencing a VSE will out-weight the perceived risk from infection [3, 4, 11]. A commonly brought example is Poliomyelitis 1 Accepted manuscript ([33] and references therein). In western countries, thanks to intensive vaccination, Polio was brought under control already in the sixties and essentially eliminated, with the disappearance of wild po- lio cases, since 1995. As the probability of vaccine associated Poliomyelitis has remained essentially unchanged, mass vaccination programmes had nonetheless to face steady flows of serious VSE. For instance in Italy during 1979-1999 an average of one vaccine-induced Poliomyelitis cases per year was reported [19], three times more than natural Poliomyelitis cases observed in the same period. Thiswould unavoidably suggest to the public, which is unaware of the complex issues of disease control, a much higher perceived risk of getting \"vaccine induced Polio\" compared to wild polio. In regimes of voluntary vaccination such situations might favour forms of vaccination free riding [28],[23].Vaccination free riding results in the family's decision not to vaccinate children after a seemingly ra- tional comparison between the perceived risk of infection and the perceived risk of VSE. Vaccination free riding can take prot of the high degree of herd immunity existing in communities with high vaccine uptake [2, 3, 4, 11]. In our previous work [11, 12] we have described vaccination free-riding as \"rational exemption\", in order to distinguish it from other forms of exemption observed in the historyof vaccination, e.g. conscientious, religious, or philosophical [24]. An increasing number of papers is being devoted to the study of the implications of rational exemp- tion for the dynamics and control of vaccine preventable diseases. Some of these works model vaccine uptake using explicit economic arguments [4, 23, 21] while other use more mathematically manage- able phenomenological representations [11, 12]. As a rule all models based on homogeneous mixing, indicate that rational exemption might make eradication impossible. Exceptions to this rule seem torequire more complex contact-network structures [21]. All previous studies have focused on the case where the driving force of the vaccine demand is rep- resented by the time changes in the perceived risk of infection, measured for example through the current (or past) disease incidence. Also, in such studies the perceived risk of VSE does not play a role, or is just taken as constant ([4]).In this paper we aim to investigate the opposite situation where the driving force of the vaccine de- mand is given by the time changes in the perceived risk of suering a vaccine side eect. We feel this case is fundamentally more appropriate in the developed world than the alternative hypothesis thatdemand is driven by the disease incidence, especially for those common vaccine preventable infections which currently have very low or even zero incidence. To this aim we study the dynamics of vaccine uptake for a homogeneously mixing vaccine preventable SIR disease [6] with vital dynamics and vaccination by a perfect vaccine under the following circum- stances: a) vaccination is voluntary; b) the vaccine has a constant probability to generate severe,non-lethal, side eects; c) the perceived risk of suering serious disease following infection is steadily low, so that the vaccine demand is essentially related, through a decreasing function, to the perceived riskMof suering a vaccine associated side eect; d) the perceived risk Mis evaluated from publicly available information on current, past, or even future (through expectations) trends of side eects caused, or attributed, to the vaccine. In particular, in order to evaluate the risk of VSE, parents are assumed to use the public information on the current, or past, reported incidence of VSE, or the prevalence of those who suered side eects. For the sake of simplicity we avoid here the complexities related to VSE misreporting, and assume that the gures on VSE which are available to the publicare those predicted by the model. In order to properly incorporate the temporal association between vaccination and onset of VSE [34], we assume that the risk of occurrence of VSE is essentially related to the time elapsed since themoment of vaccination (i.e. the age since vaccination ). This allows us to represent the vaccination dynamics by, respectively, an integro-dierential equation for the prevalence of individuals who suf-fered side eects, and an integral equation for the c orresponding incidence. These equations decouple from the other dynamic variables (i.e. susceptible and infective), with the noteworthy implicationthat the dynamics of VSE become the key determinant of the disease dynamics, through the influencethat the time trajectories of the incidence, or prevalence, of VSE have on the actual vaccine uptake. Our key equations are then investigated both in general, and under specic assumption on the age risk of suering a VSE. These investigations are carried our both for the case of current informationand delayed information. 2 Accepted manuscript Our main results show that both modelling strategies lead to the existence of a unique epidemiologi- cally meaningful steady state for the prevalence of VSE, and therefore to a unique equilibrium for the vaccine uptake. This steady state is proven to be globally stable (GAS) provided that the reaction of vaccine uptake to changing perceived risks of VSE a) is not too violent, and b) VSE occur without signicant time-delays from the moment of vaccination. These general results hold for both the cases of current as well as lagged information, though i n the latter case we need the further requirement that the average information delay is not too large. If requirements a) and b) are weakened sustained oscillations might arise. This result is not necessary but it depends on the specic patterns of onset ofVSE. For example, under current information global stability always holds when the age-risk of VSEis constant, or when it is highly concentrated on the moment of vaccine administration. On the other hand, VSE arising with a xed delay can yield sustained oscillations through Hopf bifurcations of the steady state. If nally, lagged instead of current information is used, the onset of oscillations is made easier. Similar results hold when vaccine uptake is a function of the incidence of VSE, although in this case oscillations are less common than under prevalence.These dynamics of vaccine uptake act as an external forcing terms on the epidemiological variables (susceptible and infective). We supply some asymptotic results on the dynamics of epidemiological variables for the cases where the vaccine uptake is asymptotically constant, or it oscillates. Moreover in the nal section we report the following noteworthy scenarios, illustrating the dynamic richness triggered by VSE: i) introduction of a new vaccine with transient (local) elimination of the disease but eventual long-term resurgence; ii) worsening of control conditions; iii) switches between controlepochs; iv) steady (long-term) disease oscillations of the disease forced by steady oscillations in vaccine uptake. For example scenario i) occurs after the introduction of a new vaccine which allows a transient (local) elimination of the disease but can not prevent its long-term resurgence as a consequence of the susceptible build-up caused by the decline in vaccine uptake due to the gradual accumulation of VSE (which increase the perceived risk of VSE). Scenario ii) might naturally arises for diseaseswhich are dicult to eliminate, as measles, for which the vaccine scare gradually increases due to the long time scales needed for elimination, which allow VSE to cumulate. Scenarios like i) and ii) had been predicted by the medical literature [8]. On the other hand scenario iii) is an yet unobservedphenomenon which could arise when long-period VSE-driven oscillations in vaccine uptake yield to epochs characterised by sharply dierent degrees of disease control. To the best of our knowledge no one attempted to obtain such scenarios as the output of a model with VSE-driven vaccination choice.The paper is organised as follows. In section 2 we introduce the mathematical model in its full generality, and derive the key equations for the prevalence and incidence of VSE. In section 3,4 weinvestigate the cases where the perceived risk of VSE is evaluated by, respectively, the prevalence and the incidence, of VSE. In section 5 we investigate how the dynamics of VSE aect epidemiological variables. Numerical simulations are repor ted in section 6. Concluding remarks follow. 2 Modelling the impact of information on vaccine side eects on vaccine uptake Following ideas developed in d'Onofrio et al. [11, 13] we consider the following family of SIR models for a non-fatal disease in a constant homogeneously mixing population, fractions of susceptible, infective, vaccinated and recovered in- dividuals at time t,>0 represents the birth and death rate, which are assumed identical thereby ensuring the constancy of the population, >0 the rate of recovery from infection, (t)>0t h e 3 Accepted manuscript transmission rate, which is assumed to be constant or bounded and periodically varying with minimal period usually equal to one year [1], pthe coverage for vaccination at birth. The vaccine is assumed to be 100% eective and providing lifelong immunity. As motivated in the introduction, the vaccina-tion coverage p(M) is taken to be a positive decreasing function of the perceived risk Mof suering vaccine side eects: p(M)0; p /prime(M)<0 where the perceived risk Mis assumed to be measured by individuals using publicly available in- formation on either the current (or past) incidence of VSE, or the prevalence of individuals whosuered VSE. As clear from our assumptions the key dynamic variable becomes the vaccine uptake p. Therefore we will postpone further analysis of (1) to section 5, because our primary task will be thederivation of a dynamic equation for p. To this end we need appropriate dynamic equations for the incidence and prevalence of VSE. We distinguish b etween the cases of current and past information. Let us note rst that the dynamics of current prevalence C(t) of VSE (for which it holds C(t)<V tot(t)) is determined by the balance between the outflow due to natural mortality (under the assumption thathaving experienced a VSE does not aect mortality) and the inflow Hrepresented by the incidence of newly occurred VSE: C /prime(t)=H(t)C, (3) In general if parents make their vaccination choices by using the current information only, we will haveeither M=F(C),orM=F(H)w h e r e Fis a continuous increasing function, owing to the intuition that the higher the numbers of publicly reported VSE the higher the risk perceived by the public. Here we assume, for the sake of simplicity, that Fis the identity map, i.e. we take either M=C,or M=H. To complete the specication of our model we need appropriate denitions for the time prevalence C, or the incidence H, of VSE. Consistently with the previous WHO denition, we assume that the actual risk to incur a VSE is a function of the the time elapsed since vaccination. Our main modelling ingredient is therefore an appropriate modication of the age-since-vaccination density W(t, ),introduced for other purposed by [17], and giving, at any time t, the distribution of vaccinated individuals who did not yet suer VSE, according to the time elapsed since vaccination. Letting () to dene the rate of occurrence of VSE for individuals having age of vaccination ,W(t, )o b e y s the balance PDE (4) states that vaccinated individuals of any age who did not yet suer VSE, can be removed by the onset of a VSE, at the rate (),or by mortality. The boundary condition W(t,0) =p(M(t)) represents the per-capita incidence of new vaccinations per unit of time. Based on the above equation for W(t, ), the fraction of vaccinated subjects at time not suer VSE is dened as: V(t)=/integraldisplay+ 0W(t, )d. (5) incidence of VSE is given by: H(t)=/integraldisplay+ 0()W(t, )d, (6) After solving eq. (4) with standard methods (see the appendix), one has the following convolution relation for the incidence of VSE: H(t)=f(t)+/integraldisplayt 0p(M(t))()Ko()d (7) 4 Accepted manuscript By substituting into (3) we obtain the following relation for the prevalence of VSE: C/prime=C+f(t)+/integraldisplayt 0p(M(t))()K0()d (8) where the function f(t) depends on the inital age distribution of Wand, for large t, tends to zero: f(t)0; moreover K0()=e x p/parenleftbigg /integraldisplay 0(x)dx/parenrightbigg . (9) A detailed interpretation of the previous relations is posponed to next section. Note that both the equations governing the dynamics of CandHare independent of the epidemiological variables S, I, so one can rst study the dynamics of CorH, and afterwards their influence on SandI.N o t ea l s o that, both the mdoel based on the incidence and that based on the prevalence become asymptoticallyautonomous since f(t)0 +. If instead parents also use past information Mwill be given by some convolution of the VSE history with some appropriate kernels L(.), e.g. M(t)=/integraldisplayt A(u)L(tu)du, (10) where either A(t)=C(t)o rA(t)=H(t). The delaying kernel summarises how past information on VSE concur in determining the current perceived risk of suering a vaccine side eect. In this paper wewill only consider the most common delaying kernel, represented by the exponentially fading memory: L(x)=ae ax(x>0,a>0), where the decay rate ais the reciprocal of the mean information delay D:a=1/D. This kernel allows reduction of (10) to the ODE: M/prime=a(F(A(t))M) (11) 3 Dynamics of vaccine uptake when the perceived risk is eval- uated by the prevalence of individuals who suered VSE IfM=C, i.e. the perceived risk of VSE is evaluated by the current prevalence Cof those who incurred VSE, the relation (3) takes the form of the following non-autonomous integro-dierential equation: C/prime(t)=C+f(t)+/integraldisplayt 0p(C(t))()K0()d, (12) which is a delay [18] of the convolution C/prime(t)=C+f(t)+Conv (p(C(t)),KD(t)) (13) with delaying kernel KD()=()K0(). Having estyablished the law governing the dynamics of C(t) one straightforwardly obtains the dynamics of vaccine uptake as state variable: p/prime(t)=1 /prime C(p)(C(p)+f(t)+Conv (p(t),KD(t))), (14) where C(p)i st e r s eo f p(C), and /prime C(p)<0. The equation (14) has an intuitive intepretation: if the vaccine uptake pis a function of the prevalence of individuals who suered some VSE in the past, then the dynamics of pdepends uniquely on its current and past history, since past vaccina- tions are the only source of the current burden of people who experienced some VSE. A substantiveconsequence is then that under our hypotheses the burden of VSE becomes the unique determinant of vaccine uptake, and through this, the key determinant of infection dynamics. Note nally that the delaying kernel K Ddepends on both the delay of onset of VSE after vaccine administration, and 5 Accepted manuscript the delay related to the subsequent individual survival, since we assume that VSE do never cause mortality. However, although the interpretation of (14) is clear, the factor 1 //prime C(p) makes a more detailed bio- logical and biomathematical analysis less immedi ate respect to eq. (12). Therefore our mathematical analysis will focus rst on the solutions of (12); once these will be known also the dynamics of vaccine uptake will be known through the relation p=p(C). The individual mechanisms governing the onset of vaccine associated side eects and, as a consequence, the shape of the risk function () are still poorly understood. Moreover such phenomena are likely to be vaccine-specic, i.e. dierent vaccines could have dierent risk functions (). The problem is further complicated under the multi-vaccine schedules adopted in many countries. Therefore we will rst study (12) in the general case where the form of () is left unspecied, in order to nd general patterns for the endemic equilibria and their stability. Then in the next section we will consider the eects of some noteworthy forms of (). As for the mathematical analysis let us introduce the following useful quantity: B()=/integraldisplay+ 0()Ko()d=/integraldisplay+ 0exp()exp/parenleftbigg /integraldisplay 0(z)dz/parenrightbigg ()d, (15) generating function with parameter ( ) (or the Laplace Transform calculated at the real =) of the age-density density of onset of is the corresponding survival function. Note that h() is a defective density since the cumulative lifetime probability 1 ()t os u e rs o m eV S Ei si nm o s tc a s e sas m a l l number. The function B() is a positive decreasing function such that B(0) = 1. We start by observing that (12) always has a unique epidemiologically meaningful steady state, which fullls: C=B()p(C), (16) /tildewideC=p/parenleftBig /tildewideC/parenrightBig . The by linearising at Cand Laplace-transforming, which yields: +=p/prime(C)B(+), (17) The actual solutions of (17) depend on the actual form of (.) and we will deepen this issue in next section. However, the analysis of the general case yields the following simple and easily interpretable stability condition: if the absolute value of the derivative of p(C) at the equilibrium point Cis not too large then the equilibrium is locally and globally stable: Proposition 3.1 If the following constraint |p/prime(C)|B()<1 (18) holds then the equilibrium point Cis locally and globally asymptotically stable. Therefore Cis globally stable as far as the demand for vaccines p(C) is not too reactive to conditions of changing perceived risks of sue ring VSE. More precisely, as far as p(C) is not too reactive to changing perceived risks of VSE the equilibrium is stable independently of the age mechanism through which VSE arise after vaccination. This agrees with our ndings on dierent models of vaccinating behaviour [11, 12, 13]. However, as argued in previous work on prevalence-related vaccine uptake [23, 11, 13], we expect thatin realistic circumstances the index Mwill embed not only the current but also some information on the past history of VSE. This case was important because, as shown in [23, 11, 13], the inclusionof delayed information was necessary to generate oscillations in simple SIR models with prevalence-related vaccination behaviour. 6 Accepted manuscript Thus, by treating Mas a further state variable and by using (11) with A(t)=C(t), we have that under an exponentially fading memory the single integro-dierential equation (12) is replaced by the system: C/prime(t)=C+f(t)+/integraldisplayt 0p(M(t))()Ko()d (19) M/prime(t)=a(CM) (20) It is easy to check that (19)-(20) has the equilibrium point ECM=(Ce,Me)=(C,C), where C is the solution of (16). The characteristic equation becomes: /parenleftbigg 1+ a/parenrightbigg (+)=|p/prime(C)|B(+) (21) One may show (see the appendix) that also in the present case with delayed information the condition (18) guarantees the global stability of the endemic equilibrium. The same interpretation therefore holds. 4 Impact of the side-eects rate ()on vaccine uptake We now investigate how specic noteworthy forms of the risk of side eects () aect the dynamics of vaccine uptake pthrough a more detailed stability analysis of the equilibrium C.W e f o c u s o n the onset of stable oscillations, either in absence or in presence of information delay, as represented by an exponentially fading memory. Letting to denote Dirac's delta function, we shall consider the following (somewhat complementary) forms of (): ()=\u00af(): \"instantaneous\" side eects, essentially occurring at the moment of vaccination; ()=>0: the occurrence rate of VSE is independent of the age since vaccination; ()=\u00af(T): VSE occur with a xed delay T>0 after vaccination. The following analysis will enable us to identify simple but biologically meaningful circumstances where (a) oscillations never occur, i.e. the equilibrium is stable independently of the form of the VSE generating mechanism and of the presence of information delays, (b) oscillations can only be triggered by information delay, c) oscillations arise as an endogenous property of the VSE generatingmechanism, even in absence of information delays. 4.1 Instantaneous side eects In this case, if Mdepends on current prevalence, equation becomes: C/prime=C+\u00afexp/parenleftbig \u00af/parenrightbig incidence Hof VSE is proportional to the current vaccine uptake through the factor \u00afExp/parenleftbig \u00af/parenrightbig , which represents the instantaneous probability of VSE per vaccination episode. It is immediate to see that the equilibrium Cis globally attractive independently of the size of p/prime(C). If instead Mdepends on past prevalence, the system (19)-(20) (23) M/prime(t)=a(CM) (24) C,C) is, again, GAS independently of |p/prime(C)|. Therefore both for undelayed and delayed information the vaccine uptake p(t) will be characterized by the convergence to a steady state: p(C). 7 Accepted manuscript 4.2 Constant rate of appearance of side eects If() is constant and Mdepends on current prevalence, by recalling (6) and (5), we have H=V . Moreover by integrating w.r.t. eq. (4) over (0 we get the 2-dimensional ODE system: V/prime(t)=p(C)(+)V (25) C/prime(t)=VC for which B()=/(+). System (25) has a unique equilibrium point EVC=(V,C)w h e r e V=(/)Cand which is GAS independently of p/prime(C)=p/primeC(see appendix). Therefore, also in this case the vaccine uptake will approach the constant value p(C). Note that, in case of current information, the two somewhat opposite cases, i.e. instantaneous versus constant rate onset of VSE, show a similar global behaviour for the vaccine uptake. On the other hand in case of delayed information the pattern is dierent because, as we now demonstrate, oscillations, which were excluded for instantaneous VSE, can occur in the constant rate case. In this case one obtains from (19)-(20) the 3-dimensional EQVCMone easily obtains (see the if the following condition is fullled: |p/prime(C)|<(2+)2+2 ( 2+)/radicalbig (+) (27) then there is an interval ( a1,a2), with a1>0, such that if either a<a 1ora>a 2the equilibrium is locally stable, whereas if a(a1,a2), the equilibrium is unstable. Both a=a1anda=a2are Hopf bifurcations points. Moreover for a(a1,a2) the orbits are Yakubovitch oscillatory[29, 30, 31], i.e., i.e. there exists and+>such that: liminf t+C(t)= and limsup t+C(t)=+. To sum up, in the case of VSE arising at constant rate, the inclusion of the information delay canyield sustained oscillations in the vaccine uptake p(t), whereas global attrativeness of the equilibrium p was prevailing when only current information was considered. This conrms the destabilising role played by the information delay. It is interesting to note from (27) that, consistently with the ndings in [11, 12, 13], the onset of oscillations also requires, besides the above described delay pattern, a high sensitiveness of the vaccine uptake to changing perceived risk at equilibrium. If this occurs thenthere is a whole window ( D 2=1/a2,D 1=1/a1) of values of the average information delay D=1/a, yielding steady oscillations.The onset of Yabucovitch oscillations[29, theorem only gives informations on the behaviour of a system for values of the bifurcation parameter that are close to the Hopf bifurcation threshold, and of course near the equilibrium point. On the contrary, Yabucovitch oscillations are a global property. Moreover, although their mathe- matical nature is not dened (they might be periodic, quasi-periodic or also chaotic), this uncertain mathematical classication is less importan t from the epidemiological point of view. 8 Accepted manuscript 4.3 Side eects appearing with a constant delay If VSE appear with a xed delay after vaccination: ()=\u00af(T), level of the unique steady state Cis a decreasing function ofT: d dTC(T)=P(C)\u00afexp/parenleftbig T\u00af/parenrightbig 1P/prime(C)\u00afexp/parenleftbig T\u00af/parenrightbig<0 The interesting new is that oscillations are possible even in the case of current information. In particular Tis a natural candidate as a bifurcation parameter. The following result holds: Proposition 4.1 IfG(T)<1then EQ If G(T)>1, let us denote LAS for T<T 0,i ti su n s t a b l ef o r T>T 0and and at T=T0there is a Hopf bifurcation. Moreover, in the interval of instability the solutions are oscillatory in the sense of YakubovitchThe epidemiological interpretation of the above result is that if VSE arise with a xed time delay after vaccination, then the steady state C is stable for small delays, whatever be the extent of the reaction by the public, in terms of vaccine uptake, to changing perceived risks of VSE. However forhighly reactive p(C) functions C may be destabilised in presence of longer delays, yielding sustained oscillations of vaccine uptake without the need for information delays . The intuition underlying this result, compared to the previous ones, is that there is a genuinous positive delay due to the age-since-vaccination structure (and not to the information delay which is absent), conrming once more the typically destabilising role of time lags. It is also of interest to compare this case with the one of VSE arising at constant rate: when VSE arise at constant rate, and therefore with an exponential delay,oscillations can not occur. Oscillations insted occur when a xed delay is considered. As for Yakubovitch oscillations, at the best of our knowledge Yakubovitch-type theorems have only been demonstrated for ODE and DDE with constant lag. In the previous section we gave an example of application to a system endowed of a simple delay kernel allowing reduction to nite dimensional system. However, we conjecture that they might be also applied to a general model with distributeddelays with a unique equilibrium and bounded orbits, as in our general case. In case of delayed information the model bifurcation parameter, and that in absence of information delay the lag in the occurrence of side eects, T, is such that to guarantee the local stability of the equilibrium and proceeding as in section one may show that (see the appendix) that for G(T)>1: Ifa>a 1thenEQis LAS; 9 Accepted manuscript Ifa<a 1EQis unstable, and afterwards there is another series of stability switches, and at a1 there is a Hopf bifurcation; Moreover, from the boundedness of the solutions of system (31)-(32)it follows that in the insta- bility interval the system undergoes Yakubovitch oscillations. 5 Dynamics of vaccine uptake when the perceived risk is eval- uated by the incidence of VSE The case where the perceived risk of VSE is measured through the (current or past) incidence of VSEwill be studied here quite concisely, since there are many similarities with the results of the previous sections. If the current incidence is used, then we get the following nonlinear integral equation in the incidence: H(t)=f(t)+/integraldisplay t 0p(H(t))()Ko()d, (33) The interpretation of (34) is that the incidence of VSE at any time tis the sum of two components: the component due to VSE occurred in individuals vaccinated after time zero according to the schedule p, and the component f(t) due to VSE arisen in individuals who already get vaccinated at t=0 .A sw e did in the prevalence case we can derive an equivalent nonlinear integral equation for vaccine uptake taken as the state variable of the form: (p(t)) =f(t)+/integraldisplayt 0p(t)()Ko()d, (34) Again, however, the analysis of (34) seems to us less straightfoward than (33) on which we will focus in subsequent analyses. Similarly to the prevalence case it happens that there is a unique positive equilibrium H=p(H)B(;(.)) i.e. in terms of vaccine uptake: (p)=pB(;(.)) (35) and it holds that the condition: |p/prime(H)|B(;(.))<1 (36) guarantees the local and global stability of the equilibrium.When the past incidence of VSE is considered, we obtain, under the assumption of exponentially fading memory, the system H(t)=f(t)+/integraldisplay t 0p(M(t))()Ko()d (37) M/prime(t)=a(HM) (38) Again a unique equilibrium ( He,Me)=(H,H) exists. Moreover, also here condition (36) implies the global stability of the equilibrium.As it is easy to verify, the incidence H(t),both in the current information case (33) and in the delayed information case (37)-(38), globally tends to the steady state H , for both instantaneous and constant rate side eects, independently on the steepness of pat equilibrium. Therefore in all such cases the vaccine uptake globally converges to the steady state p(H). In particular, the result concerning the case of constant rate under delayed information is of interestas it remarkably diers from the corresponding case where the perceived risk is evaluated from thedelayed prevalence of side eects. In the present H-case oscillations can not arise, whereas they were possible under suciently long patterns of delay in the C-case. The explanation is that the two types of information are by no means equivalent in that in the C-case a twofold delaying mechanism is included, i.e. the information delay in the prevalence of VSE, and the past history of incidence 10 Accepted manuscript included in the denition of the prevalence of VSE. In case of VSE occurring with a xed delay (i.e. ()=\u00af(T)) and the information is undelayed then it holds H(t)=/braceleftBigg f(t), if 0<t<T ; f(t)+\u00afexp(\u00afT)p(H(tT)),ift>T;(39) The stability analysis of the unique equilibrium Hyields (see the appendix) that if a condition G(T)<1 holds then the equilibrium of (39) is GAS, while if G(T)>1 the equilibrium is unstable. For example, in case of linearly decreasing p(M)=poMit holds: G(T)=\u00afexp(\u00afT)s o that if G(0)<1 the equilibrium is GAS for all T>0; otherwise the zone of GAS is given by T>T=1 log/parenleftbig \u00afexp(\u00af)/parenrightbig In case of delayed information with mean delay D=1/athe dynamics of His governed, for t>T (40) Again, if G(T)<1 then the equilibrium is GAS. On the other hand, if G(T)>1, we have that i)for pairs ( T,a) lying below the curve 0(T,a)=0 ,w h e e 0(T,a) is dened as follows: 0(T,a)=aT/radicalbig T,a) lying above the curve 0(T,a) = 0 the equilibrium is unstable and the solutions undergo Yakubovtich oscillations. For example, if we consider a linear p(M) function, we may have two dierent scenarios: in the rst the equilibrium is GAS for all T>0, i.e. the stability region in the ( T,a) parameter space is R2 +; in the other scenario the equilibrium is always stable in the region ( T,+)\u00b7R+, while for T(0,T) at T=0a n da t T=T. Thus, in the region T(0,T)t h e information delay is a stabilising force for a system that, in absence of lag, is unstable. In gure (1) the bifurcation locus 0(T,a)=0i ss h o w nf o r =0.02years1,\u00af= 1 and = 50000. 6D y n a m i c s o f (S, I ) Here we analyse how the dynamics of the full epidem iological system (1) are aected by the behaviour of the vaccine coverage p(t). As we have seen in the previous sections, for large times either p(globally or locally) tends to an equilibrium por it undergoes Yacubovitch oscillations of, in principle, general nature.In the case where the coverage stabilyzes to p , the (1) becomes asymptotically autonomous and equivalent to a SIR model under constant vaccination at a rate p=p. Therefore if ppc=11 R0 where R0=/(+) is the basic reproduction number (BRN), and pcdenotes the critical vaccine uptake, then the disease free equilibrium DFE =( 1p,0) is GAS, otherwise it is unstable and the unique endemic state EE=(1 R0, +v/parenleftBig 1p1 R0/parenrightBig ) is GAS. In case of periodically varying contact rate the same formula holds provided that one use the average BRN: Rav 0=/angbracketleft(t)/angbracketright/(+). A scenario of special interest is when p(t) undergoes Yacubovitch oscillations, which we have shown 11 Accepted manuscript to occur under a variety of circumstances in the previous sections. As a consequence, we are dealing with a nonlinear n on-autonomous dynamical system with known small (42) where x=(S, I)Tr,e1=( 1,0)TrandQ(x, t)=((1x1)(t)x1x2,x2((t)x1(+)))Tr.I n principle, the solutions of (42) may undergo nonlinear resonances and chaos. Note that the force F(t) itself might be chaotic, so that it might also happen that x(t) could \"lter\" it. Now, considering for example the case of constant , such oscillations in vaccine uptake might for a while lie above the critical coverage pc=11/R 0(we expect this to occur when the perceived risk of vaccine associated side eects is low), but the opposite might occur during phases of vaccine scare. Thus it is important to consider the possibility of disease-free asymptotic behaviour in response to general oscillatory behaviour of the vaccine coverage p(t). We term a disease-free solution (DFS) one for which: DFS =(X 1(t),0), (43) where X 1(t) is of the following linear dierential equation: X/prime 1=(1p(t)X1). (44) Observe that from S/prime(1pMAXS), where pMAXis the maximum attained by p(t) in its in principle known oscillations, and using standard procedures one gets that if pMAX>pcthen DFS is globally stable, which is biologically trivial since this case means that the vaccine coverage is constantly over the critical value pc. Linearizing at DFS one gets i/prime=i(X(t)(+)) and considering that it must be X/prime 1>(1pminX1) implying that, for large times, X(t)>1pmin, one also gets that if pmin<pcthen DFS is unstable. Indeed this means that p(t) is constantly under the threshold pc. More in general, if p(t) is known by using appropriate averages one may nd conditions for the global stability of the DFS. The previous results suggests to what extent departures from the critical coverage might be allowed during epochs of high (oscillating) perceived risk of VSE without compromising the target of elim-ination. This sub-critical disease-free asymptotic behaviour is a phenomenon of special interest forsituations where elimination has been achieved but the vaccine scare generates oscillations in vaccina- tion coverage which will in its turn build up cohorts of less vaccinated individuals. Such oscillations could then create the conditions for epidemics of v arious sizes as a consequence of stochastic rein- troduction of the infection through e.g. immigration. The size of these stochastically reintroduced epidemics would critically depend on the patterns of oscillations in the perceived risk. 7 Simulations We report two numerical investigations dealing with two main sub-cases discussed in the paper, i.e.the case of VSE arising at constant rate, and the xed-delay case. In both examples we focus on the case where the perceived risk of VSE is measured by the (current or delayed) prevalence of individualswith VSE. In the rst simulation we present a sample of noteworthy transient and long-term scenarios showing how disease control is aected when the vaccine uptake is mainly aected by the perceived risk of VSE. As a rule we will see that the dependency of the vaccine demand on VSE weakens the conditions for control but with a rich variety of dynamic patterns. In the second simulation we give some simple insight on the mechanisms underlying the appearance of VSE-induced oscillations invaccine uptake. 12 Accepted manuscript 7.1 Simulation 1: side eects occurring at constant rate We compare system (25), which does not include the information delay, with the corresponding delayed system (26). This case oers predictions which, though perhaps inaccurate in quantitative terms, since it assumes that everyone who is vaccinated is exposed to VSE with a risk which is independent of the age since vaccination, are nonetheless very rich in qu alitative terms. Note that (26) collapses into (25) when we let the average information delay go to zero ( a). Note further that the discriminant of the linearised system of (25) is given by = (+4p/prime(C)) suggesting that solutions to (25) will be stable but oscillatory when, comparatively, the rate of onset of VSE is small, and the absolute slope p/prime(C) of the vaccination response at equilibrium is large. The corresponding pseudo- period of the linearised oscillation will be given by 4 / , and the dumping rate is proportional to (2+). The following functional form was adopted for the p(M) function: p(M)=p0+( 1 p0)\u00b7p1(M) where p1(M)=pmin+(pmaxpmin) 1+e x p( (MM)) This formulation corresponds to the epidemiologically founded idea that the population is dividedinto three groups, say groups 1,2,3, having dierent vaccination lifestyles. The rst group, havingrelative size p 0, always vaccinates independently of the perceived risk ( M) of VSE; the second one (having size ) never vaccinates independently of M; nally group 3, having relative size (1 p0), vaccinates accordingly to the perceived risk of VSE summarised by the function p1(M). The latter function is S-shaped and decreasing in M, taking the value pmaxforM= 0 and approaching pminfor largeM(here we set for simplicity pmax=1 ,pmin= 0). The inflection point Mrepresents the average \"societal tolerance\" of VSE, nearby which most change in vaccinating behaviour as a consequence of changing perceived risk of VSE, will occur. Finally can be taken as the speed of behaviour change in that increasing values of correspond to increasingly violent responses by the public to changing perceived risks of VSE. Overall, the shape of p(M) corresponds to the epidemiological intuition that as far as the perceived risk of VSE is small then p(M) is high (i.e. roughly equal to (1 )) because individuals of group 3 have no reason to change their propensity to vaccinate, while if Mbecomes large the propensity to vaccinate of group 3 will fall dramatically, even up to zero, thereby making the community vaccine uptake close to p0. We note that though Mis a bounded function, so that arbitrarily large values of Mcan not be considered, suitable choices of parameters ( , M) allow to capture all possibly relevant vaccinating behaviour discussed here. As regards the disease dynamics we consider the following benchmark parameter constellation mim-icking measles in developed countries: =( 1/L), where 5y e a r s( s o =3.6510 5days1) is the life expectancy of the population, v=1/D,w h e r e D= 7 days is the average duration of the infective period, R0= 15, implying an average daily transmission rate =2.143 days1,a n da critical coverage pcrit=11/R 0=0.93. Finally, as regards the rate of onset of VSE we preferred, for illustrative purposes, to let it to vary in order to consider dierent scenarios, rather than to stickto the few, possibly biased, estimates available in the literature. Fig. 2 shows the dependency of the equilibrium C , which is the unique solution of the equation p(C)=r(C), where r(C)=+ C, on: (a) the rate of onset of VSE, (b) the shape of the pfunc- tion, for three distinct values of :low,medium ,high(low=/10,medium =/5,high=/2). As the ratio /(+) represent the lifetime probability to suer a VSE, for example lowwould imply an (about) 9% lifetime probability of VSE. The p(C) function is drawn for p0=0.8,=0.02, M=0.145 and for two distinct values of (low=1 0,high= 100). The critical coverage pcritis also added for sake of completeness. The whole asymptotic dynamics of the system (25) and of the related epidemiological variable is there- fore easily predicted by Fig. 2. Consider for example the case = 100. Then: (a) for the \"low\" rate of onset of VSE low, the steady state Coccurs in the high-flat part of p(C) yielding a low value ofC, i.e. a low perceived risk of VSE at equilibrium, which does not cause a substantial decline in coverage; the equilibrium coverage p(C) remains in excess of the critical one, thereby allowing 13 Accepted manuscript elimination; the convergence to the equilibrium uptake is monotonic since Coccurs in the flat part ofp(C); (b) for =highthe equilibrium Coccurs in the low-flat part of p(C). This yields a high value of C, i.e. a high perceived risk of VSE at equilibrium, and a substantial decline in the equilibrium coverage, little in excess of p0,and therefore largely below the critical level. This allows the endemic persistence of the disease, with dynamics which do not dier from those of the SIR model with vaccine uptake set at the level of p0;( c ) n a l l y ,f o r =medium , the steady state Coccurs in the steep part of the p(C) curve, again yielding an equilibrium coverage p(C) below the critical level so that the long term outcome is still disease persis tence. The interesting new is that in this case the convergence to Cis oscillatory, thereby causing an oscillatory forcing to the epidemiological system. In this case ( = 100) the linear pseudo-period is too large ( = 155 years) to have epidemiological signicance, which does not prevent other parameter constellations to yield more interesting results.1 The dynamics of the vaccination variables of (25) yield however several interesting possibilities as regards the actual patterns of the epidemiological variables ( S, I). We consider rst the standard transient situation where a new vaccine is introduced at the (slightly perturbed) pre-vaccination en- demic state of the SIR in this case: V(0) = 0, C(0) = 0. After time zero VSE start to cumulate, i.e. the C(t) function monotonically increases in the rst epochs after vaccine introduction, thereby increasing the degree of vaccine scare. The actual impact of this process on the disease dynamicsdepends on the interplay of the various parameters relating to VSE and the public's response. We report a sample of various interesting transient post-vaccination scenarios. (a) Elimination and eventual disease reemergence. This scenario is illustrated in Fig. 3, where the parameters are: p 0=0.80,=0.02, =2.5,M=0.145; =10. Here model (25) converges to its steady state in a non-oscillatory way (Fig. 3, left). In particular the vaccination programmesatises p(t)>p cfor a period of time long enough to allow elimination in the short-term. This occurs because in this phase the accumulation of VSE is slow enough so that eliminationoccurs before the perceived risk of VSE (measured through C) has increased enough to signif- icantly aect vaccine uptake. However the disease eventually re-emerges. Indeed, the eective reproduction number R E(t)=R0S(t), which continued to decline for about 20 year after the initiation of the programme, re-starts to steadily increase after that date (Fig. 3, right). This is the consequence of the gradual accumulation of VSE which gradually enflate Cand therefore the perceived risk of VSE, therefore reducing vaccine uptake, which in turn yields a steady build up in the susceptible fraction. By assuming that the disease is not globally eradicated (so that the local vaccination policy is continued), a stochastic reintroduction of a single infective individual at (about) t= 55 years causes a large epidemic outbreak rst, and then the endemic re-emergence of the disease, since the vaccine uptake in the long term does not signicantly exceed 80%, i.e. largely below the critical level. Note that the disease re-emergence occurs with a gradual decrease in the inter-epidemic period, that in the long-term will land on a value which are characteristic of the classical SIR model with 80% vaccination at birth. (b) Worsening of control conditions. This scenario is illustrated in Fig. 4, where the parameters are:p0=0.80,=0.08, =2.5,M=.145,= 10).In this case Candp(C) still converge without oscillations. Since is large initial elimination can not occur. Nonetheless the disease is initially brought to high levels of control (with long inter-epidemic oscillations) because vaccineuptake is initially high because the perceived risk of VSE is initially very low, still due to the low accumulation of VSE. However in the long term the slow but continued accumulation of VSE make vaccine uptake much lower so that the disease progressively switches to a dierent dynamic pattern by restoring shorter period inter-epidemic oscillations. This situation, which 1Finally, less interesting things occur when p(C) lies always above or always below the critical uptake: in the former case the disease is always eliminated independently of the public responses to perceived risks of VSE, while in the latter the disease will always persist. 14 Accepted manuscript had been predicted in the medical literature [8], is a potential danger faced by developed countries especially in the case of diseases dicult to eliminate, and for which the perceived risk of serious disease is steadily small. (c) Switches in control epochs. This scenario is illustrated in Fig. 5, where the parameters are: p0=0.80,=0.08, =/5,M=.145,= 20000. Under this parameter constellation system (25) exhibits damped oscillations, triggered by the large value. After the initial adjustment phase during which the prevalence of VSE cumulate toward its steady-state, the vaccination variables ( V,C,p (C)) initiate to show pronounced waves (Fig. 5, left). These waves are triggered by the shape of p(M) but are a natural outcome of the vaccination system, where epochs of vaccine scare diminish vaccine uptake which subsequently reduces the prevalence of individualswith VSE, thereby stimulating an increase in vaccine uptake. These long-period waves (the pseudo-period of linear oscillations close to the equilibrium is in this case about 40 years) force the epidemiological variables to oscillate in the form of sequences of \"vaccination epochs\", nicelydepicted in Fig. 5 (right). Epochs of low vaccine uptake are characterised by comparatively shorter inter-epidemic oscillations which are however gradually replaced over time by new epochs of higher vaccine uptake with longer inter-epidemic period, and so on. The dynamics of the delayed system (26) are richer, thereby forcing richer dynamics in the epi- demiological variable. As the mathematical analysis suggests, we expect that as far as the speedof behaviour change is small then the unique equilibrium of (26) is locally (and globally) stable independently of the delay . In this case the dynamics of the delayed system remain similar to those of its non-delayed counterpart. When however, other things being equal, exceeds a critical value crit, and provided the steady state lies in the steep portion of p(C), then the presence of the information delay allows the onset of asymptotically steady oscillations through Hopf bifurcation of the steadystate. Fig. 6 shows the regions of values of the mean information delay Dyielding to local stability vs local instability computed through the Routh-Hurwitz stability condition, for two distinct values of . Note that: i) higher values of yield a wider instability region, and ii) for large values essentially any, however small, information delays are likely to yield steady oscillations. The onset of (asymptotically) stable oscillations in the vaccination system (V,C ) supplies an asymp- totically periodic forcing to the system of epidemiological variables ( S, I). In particular since a long- transient is necessary in order that the stable limit cycle of the vaccination system ( V,C) to materialise, a long and complex oscillatory transient occurs also in the ( S, I) system. To illustrate the asymptotic eect of the vaccination dynamics for the epidemiological system we therefore focus only on long-term behaviour. For example (see Fig. 7, where: p 0=0.80,=0.05, =/5,M=.145,= 45000,D = 220 days. Note that this is a parametric constellation corresponding to a unstable equilibrium) an average information delay of about 7 months yield a nice stable limit cycle in vaccine uptake, with a period of about 28 years (Fig 7 left). These oscillations trigger stable oscillations with the same period in(S, I) (Fig. 6 right). In particular the very steep shape of p(C) causes the vaccine uptake to bounch between its aordable minimum and maximum, so that the eective reproduction number shows os-cillations of considerable amplitude. Further stretching of critical parameters, such as ,a r ea b l et o increase the amplitude of oscillations in the ( V,C) variables, yielding even richer oscillation patterns in the epidemiological ones ( S, I), seemingly through period doubling and chaos (not reported here). Nonetheless it is to be pointed out that such oscillations are characterised by minima of the infective proportion during the low phases of such oscillations which become smaller and smaller, therefore questioning the validity of the deterministic framework. 7.2 Simulation 2: side eects arising with a xed delay Here we consider system (28) under the following piecewise linear vaccine uptake function: p(C)=m a x/parenleftbigg 1C C,0/parenrightbigg (45) 15 Accepted manuscript implying that the vaccine uptake is maximal when the perceived risk of VSE is zero, but it approaches zero as Capproaches a value C>0,and it remains zero thereafter. The constant Ccan be taken to represent the maximal level of VSE the community is capable to tolerate. The previous formulation is rather \"extremal\" but it has the advantage of being simple, thereby making transparent the mechanisms leading to oscillations. The equilibrium equation here takes the simple form C=\u00afexp/parenleftbig \u00af/parenrightbig exp(T)p(C) exp(T)+CC In particular the quantity which appears in the characteristic equation sharply simplies since p(C) has a constant derivative: A(T)=\u00afexp/parenleftbig \u00af/parenrightbig exp(T) C This allows to simplify for essentially all cases of practical interest the equation (29) determining the bifurcating delays. In fact the term exp( T)=e x p( T/L)( w h e r e Lis the life expectancy of the human host) is essentially equal to unit in the most important case of short-delay VSE (the case where the causal link to the vaccine can be meaningfully established), e.g. Tof the order of days or at most a few weeks ( T/Lhas the order 105104) and still gives an excellent approximation for T of the order of a few years. The latter case is not of little relevance since it potentially deals with the situation where vaccines are perceived by the public as a possible cause underlying the long-term onsetof allergic or of auto-immune diseases. Here the issue of causal imputation is of course a complex one, but nonetheless the problem can not be ignored since what really matters is the public's perception that a causal link might exist. As regards the current medical literature, there seems to be little evidence that vaccines cause allergic diseases ([5],[15],[25]), but on the other hand the possibility that vaccines might be responsible of auto-immune diseases is an accepted hypothesis ([20]). Be things as they may, the possibility that time series of incidence of auto-immune and/or allergic diseasesenter the \"information set\" on which anti-vaccinators base their decisions is a concrete one, largely documented in the ocial documents and sites of anti-vaccination groups. In all these cases we can take A(T)\u00afExp/parenleftbig \u00af/parenrightbig C=A so T=arccos/parenleftBig A/parenrightBig +2k,k=0,1,... In particular the rst switch from stability to instability, which is the most relevant for practicalpurposes, occurs for T H,1=Arccos(C/exp ()) 2/radicalBig (exp()/C)212 It is thus easy to see that for fastly occurring VSE the rst bifurcating delay TH,1(provided it is meaningful) is, as expected, an increasing function of C: indeed as Cincreases, the slope of thep(C) function decreases, thereby requiring longer average information delays to destabilise the equilibrium. A possible shape of the bifurcation locus in the ( C,T) plane is depicted in Fig. 8 (in log scale) for two distinct values of the rate of onset of VSE. The graph indicates an exponential relation between TH,1for relatively large C, and, other things being equal, that the bifurcating delay TH,1is decreasing in . Overall this indicates that for values of the delay Tof onset of VSE of the order of a few days, as are those specied in the protocols for identication of vaccination as the causal factor of VSE, the onset of \"VSE induced\" oscillations requires a combination of unlikely high rates of onset 16 Accepted manuscript of VSE, and a very low \"societal\" tolerance ( C) to VSE. For example for C=1 04, a meaningful bifurcating delay of 11 days would require values of close to 1 (implying that on average 67% of vaccinated individuals incur some VSE), whereas the more reasonable value =0.05 (implying that on average 5% of vaccinated individuals incur some VSE), already yields a bifurcating delay around 3 months. Things would be dierent if vaccines could be identied as responsible of long-term side eects, as it would be the case for the onset of allergic or auto-immune diseases long after vaccination.In this case the average delay Twould take large values, say several years, therefore allowing the onset of oscillations for less stressed values of andC . This seems to suggest that reactions by the public to VSE are more likely to induce oscillations in vaccine uptake when long delays occurbetween the moment of vaccination and the onset of the presumed VSE, as it might occur for the scare that vaccines cause allergic diseases, or when further delaying factors, as information delays (not considered here), are included. Fig. 9 reports, for the sake of completeness, the con vergence to a stable limit cycle fluctuating around C of the key variable C(other parameter values are: =0.1,C=1 04,s ot h a t TH,1= 47days) andT= 540 days, i.e. a delay of 1.5 years mimicking the scare of vaccine induced allergic, or auto- immune, diseases. The inter-epidemic is around 30 years. These oscillations cause the vaccine uptake, and therefore also the epidemiological variables, to oscillate. These oscillations can be shown to bevery small because p(C) shows small amplitude oscillations (between 0 and 0 .05), which little aect the epidemiological oscillations. This is an obvious consequence of the peculiar choice (45) of thevaccine uptake function. Finally, in the case of delayed information obeying an exponentially fading memory, our numerical calculations show that not in all cases the information delay is able to destabilize the equilibrium state. For example, let us assume, as above that =0.1a n d C =1 04, implying a Hopf bifurcation atT=4 7d a y s .I f T= 32 then there is the onset of oscillations at DH95days (where Nz>0) and the stability is lost at D1410 days (where Nz<0); for T= 40 days the Hopf bifurcation occurs atDH11days, whereas the stability is recovered at the unrealistically high value D8850days. However, if T= 30 the equilibrium remains stable. 8 Discussion The paper has investigated a variety of models for the dynamic implications of vaccination choices in contexts where vaccination is voluntary, and the perceived risk of serious disease is steadily low, so that the only endogenous determinant of vaccination choices is given by the trend in the perceived riskof experiencing some vaccine side eect. At the best of our knowledge, compared to the large number of works on prevalence driven vaccine demand, this is the rst paper focusing on VSE as the main determinant of vaccine uptake. We have considered two main cases, i.e. the cae where the perceived risk of VSE is evaluated from the publicly available information on the prevalence of individuals who suered some VSE, and the case where the perceived risk of VSE is evaluated from the incidence ofVSE. An interesting consequence of our modelling choice is that the vaccination sub-system, which de- termines the perceived risk of VSE and the vaccine uptake, decouples from the epidemiological sub-system. As regards the vaccination sub-system we have demonstrated, both in general and for selected epidemiologically relevant sub-cases, the conditions under which the dynamics of vaccine uptake landson a globally stable steady state, rather than in stable oscillations, of vaccine uptake. Unlike previous results on epidemiological models with prevalence-driven vaccination [23, 11, 13], where information lags were necessary to trigger oscillations, in the present case steady oscillations can arise also whencurrent information only is used to evaluate the p erceived risk (of VSE). The explanation is that the appropriate modelling of vaccine side eects required the introduction of an age mechanism, e.g.another type of lag, to describe the onset of VSE.The actual dynamics of VSE then act as an external forcing for the dynamics of the epidemiological sub-system. This leads to the inter esting scenarios for disease control discussed in the simulations. In particular we have also considered the case of VSE arising with long time-delays. Though in this casethe problem of the correct causal imputation of a gi ven disease condition to a vaccination occurred 17 Accepted manuscript several years prior to the disease onset is probably hopeless, we feel nonetheless this case well repre- sents the case of the scare that vaccines can cause allergic or auto-immune disease, which is a main argument by anti-vaccinators. The type of modelling adopted here, and the related predictions, seem to be of interest for all situa- tions where the (immediate or long-term) consequences of the disease are perceived as minor. Such situations do not only arise as a consequence of high degrees of control through vaccination, but alsoat sub-optimal degrees of control for diseases wh ich are perceived by the public to be of little dan- gerousness, despite circulation is still signicant. An example of such situation could be Varicella, forwhich the introduction of the vaccine is still under debate. We feel Varicella is a disease currentlyperceived as minor by parents, which are usually unaware of the protecting role of vaccination against zoster. We guess so that the introduction of a (voluntary) vaccination programme against varicella could in some cases yield largely sub-optimal coverages, so that the social alarm caused by episodes of vaccine associated side eects, from the varicella one but also from other vaccines, could become a main driving force of disease dynamics.Though there is little direct empirical evidence that trends and fluctuations in incidence of VSE ac- tually aect individuals' vaccination choices, the possibility that vaccine success in controlling disease would ultimately yield the incidence of VSE to override disease incidence was forecasted long time ago ([8]). Moreover there is a wide evidence indicating that the scare of the lack of vaccine safety is a major argument behind vaccine refusal. A good example here is represented by the persistency of the MMR- autism scare over time, which has caused a persistent decline largely below the criticaltheshold in MMR vaccine uptake in the UK ([14],[26],[27]). We feel that this should not necessarily be interpreted as an isolated rumour, but perhaps as a persistent phenomenon where families are care- fully monitoring the incidence of autism cases over time, and taking it into account in their decision function. In perspective we feel that appropriate studies of the vaccine demand should abandon the \"reduction-ist\" approach (i.e. focusing on a single disease at time) used by standard epidemiological modelling, to better investigate how patterns of VSE from some vaccines could aect vaccine uptake from other (or all) vaccines as well. Future work should improve the present model by including vaccination choicesin a behavioural, rather than phenomenological, manner (according to e.g. [4]). Stochastic extension of the model would allow better predictions for all the circumstances where the disease becomes sub- critical as a consequence of fluctuations in vaccine uptake. Spatial extensions would allow to better take into account the social alert caused by VSE at the various local scales, e.g. the possibility that mild VSE create rumours that are likely to have some importance only in the local network of contacts(e.g. the child who suered from VSE, his/her family, and neighbours), while episodes of severe VSE typically receive large amplications by media, being thereby communicated to the whole population. 9A c k n o w l e d g e m e n t s The authors warmly thank an anonymous referee and an Editor of the Journal for their very valuable indications which allowed to greatly improve this work.

As a consequence if (18) holds then |r.h.s.|<. As a consequence, due to the contradiction, (17) cannot have solution with non-negative real part, and the equilibrium is locally stable. The proof on global stability is essentially based method of contracting rectangles (in our case: in-tervals) [6, 22], and in it we shall use the function g(z)=B ()P(z). Since p(C) is decreasing, it is p(C(t))p(0) and a consequence: C/primeC+f(t)+p(0)/integraldisplayt 0()Ko()d, which implies that: lim t+C(t)g(0), i.e. the interval J0=[ 0,g(0)] is attractive. Thus, we may consider initial conditions lying in J0.F o r them it is: C/primeC+f(t)+p(g(0))/integraldisplayt 0()Ko()d, implying: lim t+C(t)g(2)(0), thus the interval J1=[g(2)(0),g(0)] is positively invariant and attractive. Proceeding in this way, afterk'steps' we obtain that the interval Jk=[g(k+1)(0),g(k)(0)] is attractive. These intervals tend to the degenerate interval [ C,C]2provided that the discrete dynamical system : yk+1=g(yk) (47) hasCinftyas globally asymptotically stable equilibrium. Now, setting y2k=ukwhere uk+1=g(2)(uk),u0=y0 19 Accepted manuscript andy2k+1=vkwhere vk+1=g(2)(vk),v0=g(y0), we have that the behaviour of (47) depends on the behaviour of the discrete dynamical system induced by the map g(2)(z). This map is monotone increasing since it is the composition of two strictly decreasing maps, thus the well known condition that its derivative at the equilibrium point is less than one:d dzg(2)(z)|z=C<1 idest (g/prime(C))2<1 guarantees the global asymptotic convergence to C. As a consequence, condition (18) implies the global asymptotic stability of the equilibrium solution of (8) In the case of delayed information, it holds that: Proposition A.1 Condition 18 guarantees the Local and Global Asymptotic Stability of the equilib- rium solution of (19)-(20). Proof Let it be a solution of (21) such that /Rfractur()0. Thus, calculating the modulus l.h.s. of (21) it yields that: |l.h.s.|=|1+ a||+|> (as it is straightforward to verify). Thus, proceeding as in proposition 3.1 we may easily demonstrate our claim. Similarly, also the proof of the global stability is an extension of the proof of proposition 3.1. Indeed, that proof was based on a sequence of contracting intervals determined by a sequence of dierentialinequalities. Also here we shall use the function: g(z)=B ()p(z). Since p(M) is decreasing, 0()Ko()d <C+p(0)/integraldisplayt 0()Ko()d, the interval J0=[ 0,g(0)] is such that positively invariant and attractive for C(t) and, thanks to the inequalities: aMM/primea(g(0)M), also for M(t). Summarizing the rectangle: A0=J0\u00d7J0 is attractive for ( M,C). Thus, we may consider initial conditions lying in A0. For them it is: C/prime>C+f(t)+p(g(0))/integraldisplayt 0()Ko()d and esily we may show that the rectangle A1=[g(2)(0),g(0)]\u00d7[g(2)(0),g(0)] is positively invariant and attractive. Proceeding in this way, after k'steps' we obtain that the rectangle Ak=[g(k+1)(0),g(k)(0)]\u00d7[g(k+1)(0),g(k)(0)] is positively attractive. Thus, proceeding as in the other proof, we may show that this sequence of rectangles tends towards the point ( C,C) (= towards a degenerate rectangle). 20 Accepted manuscript A.3 The delayed prevalence case: side eects occurring at a constant rate Concerning the oscillation result of subsection (4.2), by linearising system (26) at its equilibrium point one gets the characteristic equation: 3+( 2++a)2+(a+(+)(+a))+a(+(1 +|p/prime(C)|)) = 0 (48) Since the coecients are positive the unique requirement for local stability is the Routh-Hurwitz con- dition, leading to the condition (27). The claim on the Yakubovitch oscillatority easily follows by i) the boundedness of C(t)( r e m e m b e rt h a t C(t)<Vtot(t)<1);ii)the instability of EQ. The properties i)andii)allow applying A.4 The prevalence case: side eects occurring with a constant delay Proof of proposition 4.1. y linearising and applying the Laplace transform, we obtain the equation: +=A(T)exp( T) (49) where A(T)=|p/prime(C(T))|\u00afExp/parenleftbig \u00afT/parenrightbig . (50) It easy to show that (49 ) has, for small T< < 1 or two negative real solutions, one near A(0) and the other very large. Therefore in both cases instability can only occur through a Hopf bifurcation. Inparticular, consistently with the previous example, the case T= 0 is a stable one, and bifurcations, if any, must occur for higher delays. Let us look therefore for Hopf bifurcation points, searching purelyimaginary solutions =jof the characteristic equation, leading to the following pair of equations: cos(T)=1 G(T) sin(T)= G(T)(51) Note that GAS From (51) we immediately get: (T)=\u00b1/radicalbig G(T)21 Observe that since for T= 0 the DDE reduces to an ODE with a unique and GAS equilibrium point, for continuity this fact implies that G(T)>1 implies the existence of a threshold Twhere the inequality is not fullled and where the equilibrium point C(T) is locally stable. The bifurcation values are, then, determined by the eq. (29). The proof of the stability switch follows by the considerations exposed before the statement of this proposition, and, in particular, condition(30) is simply the non-zero speed condition: d dT|=i H(T0). Moreover, by including the information delay, we observe that a candidate Hopf point =ihas to solve: eq. (52) has no solutions, whereas if G(T)>1 there is the following solution: 2 H(a)=2a2+/radicalbig 4a22G2+(a22)2 2(53) 21 Accepted manuscript and it may be that the non-zero speed is positive, 2(+a)(G1) + (a2+2)>+/radicalbig 4a22G2+(a22)2. The instantaneous side eects In presence of vaccination choices based on current info rmation, instantaneous side eects yields the equation: H(t)=f(t)+\u00afexp/parenleftbig \u00af/parenrightbig p(H(t)), for which it is trivial to show that H(t)Hglobally. When vaccination choices are based on past informat ion according to an exponentially fading memory, one yields the simple scalar ODE: M/prime(t)=a/parenleftbig \u00afp(M)M/parenrightbig , whose unique equilibrium is GAS. A.6 The incidence case: side eects occurring at constant rate In the case ()=it holds H(t)=V. In turn, Vobeys the ODE: V/prime=p(V)(+)V, which has a unique GAS equilibrium given by: ( +)V=p(V). In case of delayed information, we get the following 2-dimensional ODE system M/prime=a(VM) V/prime=p(M)(+)V (55) whose unique equilibrium is GAS. A.7 The incidence case: side eects occurring after a constant delay When vaccination choices are based on current inform ation, the characteristic equation reads as: =1 Tln (G(T)) +i. where: G(T)=|p/prime(H)|\u00afexp(\u00afT). (56) which quickly leads to the results reported in the main text. When vaccination choices are based on past info rmation according to an exponentially fading memory the characteristic equation becomes: 1+ a=A(T)exp (T) (57) 22 Accepted manuscript where A(T)=G(T),andG(T) was dened above. If G(T)<1 then the equilibrium is GAS. On the contrary if G(T)>M a x (1,1/a) then the Hopf bifurcation points lie on the curves where k(T,a) is dened as follows k(T,a)=aT/radicalbig G2(T)1+Atn/radicalbig G2(T)1+2k (58) Therefore if the point ( T,a) lies below the curve 0(T,a) = 0 then the equilibrium is LAS, while if (T,a) lies above the curve, then the equilibrium is unstable. This is readily seen by choosing aas bifurcation parameter and calculating the nonzero speed condition R.M, 1996. Infectious diseases of humans: dynamics and control, Oxford University Press, Oxford.
