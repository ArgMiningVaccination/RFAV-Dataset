The tournament entered a three- year partnership with KU Wichita Pediatrics to serve as the event's charitable partner. The tournament has officially been renamed the Wichita Open Benefitting KU Wichita Pediatrics. \"We are thrilled to announce KU Wichita Pediatrics as the benefiting partner for the Wichita Open,\" said Korn Ferry Tour President Alex Baldwin. \"The Korn Ferry Tour has an incredible 30-year history in Wichita, and with the support of KU Wichita Pediatrics, we'll continue to help children in Kansas and make a lasting impact in the local community.\" KU Wichita Pediatrics is the region's largest group of academic pediatric specialists and supports the state's only training program for pediatricians. It provides unique clinical services, teaching, child advocacy, medical leadership, and research, all focused on helping Kansas children achieve health and wellness. \"This is a natural partnership for us because we are both focused on supporting children,\" describes Brian Pate, chair of KU Wichita Pediatrics and professor of Pediatrics at KUSM-W. \"Aligning the region's premier pediatric team and sporting event supports KU Wichita Pediatrics' mission to be \"Together for Kansas Children. Forever.\" The Wichita Open Benefitting KU Wichita Pediatrics is a 72-hole competition featuring 156 players from around the world. Debuting in 1990, the tournament is one of four original tour stops that remain on the current schedule. The event has been played at Crestview Country Club since 2000 and was named the Korn Ferry Tour's Tournament of the Year in 2019. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Korn Ferry Tour's 2020 and 2021 seasons combined as a one-time, wraparound season. Continued on page 2.CHAIR'S CORNER We couldn't do it without you! If you are wondering what I am talking about, well, I am talking about everything. Truly, the KU Wichita Pediatrics mission for children in our region is so big and important that it requires all of us working together. Our purpose statement is \"Together for Kansas Children. Forever.\" and there is a reason it begins with \"together.\" We deeply value our collaborations, are grateful for them, and we strive to be accountable and effective partners. Your engagement with us through Milestones is an example of that collaboration. We thank you for making time to learn about what we are doing, and we welcome your input and ideas.

SOLLO, GROWING IS A KEY OUTCOME Natalie Sollo, M.D., associate professor and director of the Department of Pediatrics' ambulatory division, loves the process of watching how children grow. Thanks to advancements in cystic fibrosis treatments, she says, more of her patients have an opportunity to grow up. A 1985 graduate of the Baylor College of Medicine, Dr. Sollo moved to Wichita in 1989 to join a private practice group after completing her residency at the Cincinnati Children's Medical Center. With two sons to raise with her husband, David, an anesthesiologist, Dr. Sollo eventually left her practice and did locums. It was during that time she started working with CF patients. In 2001, the then-director of the CF clinic on the St. Francis campus of Ascension Via Christi needed assistance and Dr. Sollo answered the call. Eleven years later, Dr. Sollo was named director of the clinic, one of more than 130 CF care centers accredited by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and one of only two CF clinics in Kansas. \"It's been a good place to work and it's a field that's changed so much,\" Dr. Sollo said. \"New classes of medications are helping kids live dramatically healthier lives.\" She's also found a good place to help even more children indirectly by educating future doctors studying at KU School of Medicine-Wichita. A volunteer faculty member since 1990, Dr. Sollo joined the faculty full time in 2006. Dr. Sollo also specializes in health care quality improvement, a very natural fit since QI is an active factor in delivering CF patient care. \"It's been a real privilege to work with the school. I love teaching students because of how they challenge me to learn new things and stay cutting edge. You have to because they are watching you,\" she said. Outside of watching patients and students grow, Dr. Sollo has another interest tied to growth. After indulging their longtime passion for wine by belonging to area wine clubs, she and her husband planted a vineyard in Whitewater, about 30 miles north of Wichita. Grace Hill Winery opened in 2008. In recent years, the couple's sons have taken over running the family business that produces 14 different wines. \"They handle the vineyard and I get to plant the flowers now,\" she said.The Wichita Open is a go Continued3NEW FACULTY: HEMATOLOGY ONCOLOGY ADDS THIRD FULL-TIME FACULTY MEMBER With the addition of new pediatrics faculty member Elisa Stauffer, M.D., KU School of Medicine-Wichita is growing a much-needed subspecialty in the greater Wichita area. Dr. Stauffer, who joined the Department of Pediatrics in fall 2020, specializes in pediatric hematology and oncology. Growing that division means more children in the region can receive treatment and access to ongoing patient care closer to home. After the Oklahoma native earned her medical degree and did her residency with the University of Oklahoma College of Medicine in 2007 and 2010, respectively, Dr. Stauffer completed a hematology and oncology fellowship in 2015 with the Cohen Children's Medical Center in New York City. After living for 18 months in Milan, Italy, following her fellowship while her husband finished business school, the couple returned to New York City. There, Dr. Stauffer worked as a medical writer, founded a pediatric research company specializing in clinical trials and became a part-time hospitalist with Cohen Children's Medical Center. Joining the KUSM-Wichita faculty fulfilled two of Dr. Stauffer's goals: being able to teach and raising her three children \u2014 ages 5, 3 and 1 \u2014 in the Midwest, away from the hectic pace of New York City and closer to family with space to indulge her and her husband's interest in food gardening. Her husband, Julian, is an industrial engineer and runs his business dealing with food manufacturing equipment remotely. \"My old job wasn't a teaching position and I wanted to be in a place where I could make more of a difference,\" Dr. Stauffer said. She is the third full-time faculty member to join the KUSM-Wichita pediatric hematology oncology group that was created just a few years ago. \"I like being able to be in a place where I can help build and grow something. I wanted to live someplace where I could be on a frontier.\" Dr. Stauffer has a particular interest in the diseases of childhood leukemia, sickle cell disorders and lymphoma. She also is active in research and conducting clinical trials in pediatric oncology.

This comes with challenges. Historically, PCPs did not receive adequate training in pediatric mental health and therefore many practicing PCPs lack comfort and knowledge to respond to this call to action. In addition, there is a vast shortage of pediatric mental health experts making it difficult for PCPs to access expert advice when managing youth with mental illness in their practices. For these reasons, KU Wichita Pediatrics partnered with Kansas Department of Health and Environment and the University of Kansas School of Medicine-Wichita Departments of Pediatrics and Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences to establish KSKidsMAP. KSKidsMAP is a Pediatric Mental Health Access Program that is supported by a four-year HRSA grant supported by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Established in 2019, the program supports enrolled PCPs in assessing, diagnosing and managing mental disorders in youth in their own clinical practices. Integral to KSKidsMAP is the Pediatric Mental Health Expert Team, which is comprised of two board-certified child and adolescent psychiatrists, a board-certified child and adolescent psychologist, a board-certified pediatrician with experience in adolescent medicine and mental health, and a social worker. The PMHT offers multidisciplinary expertise through the KSKidsMAP Consultation Line and KSKidsMAP TeleECHO Clinic. Since its inception, 106 PCPs have enrolled in the program serving 59 out of 105 Kansas counties (Figure 1). Through the KSKidsMAP Consultation Line, PCPs can connect with the social work care coordinator who can offer support by providing mental and behavioral health resources for their patients, community resources, toolkits, best practice information and physician wellness resources. By contacting the consultation line, PCPs can also request case consultation services with a member of the PMHT. Through the TeleECHO Clinic, KSKidsMAP aims to create an all teach/all learn environment for PCPs to learn right in their practice how to provide the best care for children and adolescents with mental and behavioral health disorders. The TeleECHO Clinic meets on the first and third Tuesday of every month during the noon hour for case-based learning discussion and didactic learning. Over 60% of enrolled PCPs have participated in the ongoing TeleECHO Clinic sessions since the launch in April 2020. PCPs who utilized the consultation line and/ or participated in the TeleECHO Clinic provided positive feedback regarding how beneficial the resources and discussion have been in increasing their ability to treat youth within their own practices. During the TeleECHO Clinic discussion one physician from a rural practice shared, \"KSKidsMAP provides the extension of care of a pediatric medical home with the psychiatric expertise to provide the best mental health care to the children under one roof.\" CMEs, continuing education and maintenance of certification credits are available through the KSKidsMAP program. To access support services made available through the KSKidsMAP Consultation Line and/or participate in the KSKidsMAP TeleECHO Clinic, physicians should enroll by calling 1-800-332-6262, emailing KSKidsMAP@kumc.edu or visiting wichita.kumc.edu/KSKidsMAP . Figure 1: 106 enrolled KSKidsMAP physicians and clinicians, 59/105 counties. 6Judy Blair and Donnita Pelser at a COMSEP meeting in St. Louis, 2016. Donnita taught a class that Judy completed. Judy Blair celebrated her 30th anniversary in 2018 with KU School of Medicine-Wichita Medical Practice Association employees Cecilia Luna, human resources director, and Aaron Ryan, executive director.JUDY BLAIR LEAVES HOME When Judy Blair moved to Wichita from Topeka in 1988, she found a home within the Department of Pediatrics with the University of Kansas School of Medicine-Wichita. After a 32-year career with KUSM-Wichita, Blair retired in December 2020, having been slowed down by the effects of Parkinson's disease. \"I'm going to miss my people the most,\" Blair said, shortly before her retirement date, which was two days before her 67th birthday. \"I really liked working with them, talking with them and finding out what they were doing.\" Blair, whose official title at retirement was professional provider liaison/assistant clerkship coordinator, explained simply that she provided support wherever needed, from scheduling patients and transcribing medical notes for her first supervisor, Sechin Chin, M.D., a pediatrics geneticist, to helping Donnita Pelser, the department's clerkship administrator. Blair and Pelser grew particularly close, having worked together in department offices for all but one year of Blair's time at KUSM-Wichita. In retirement, Blair is indulging her creative side, turning the office she worked from remotely last year during COVID-19 shutdowns into an art studio. Blair started working with ceramics at age 8 with her mother and in high school added painting to her portfolio. She's never stopped doing art since. \"I just love it.\"Medically Complex Clinic With the passing of the Social Security Act in 1935, the government made provisions to establish state and federal funds to care for crippled children. Within a few years, every state had established programs to assist children with special needs. These programs included clinics for cleft palate, orthopedics, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida and cerebral palsy. Providers such as physicians, surgeons, nurses, social workers, physical and occupational therapists, speech and hearing therapists, nutritionists, dentists, and orthodontists were working together to care for children that required these services. Today, in 2021, Kansas still has a program for children with special needs. KU Wichita Pediatrics Medically Complex Clinic has grown from the original crippled children's program to taking care of children with cerebral palsy, spina bifida, genetic disorders and other medical disorders. We still have the same specialists as the original clinics, but have also added a psychologist, orthotist/prosthetist and a family advocate to the already impressive team of providers. We also have the ability to leverage referrals to genetics, urology, cardiology, endocrinology and others. Sid Sivamurthy, M.D., attended the CP clinic, as it was formerly known, while he was in residency, and decided he wanted to be involved with the program throughout his career. When the clinic was in jeopardy of closing in 2017, he quickly presented it to the KU Wichita Pediatrics department chair, who gave him the green light to bring it into the KU Wichita Pediatrics family. Jo Ann Matthews, LBSW, started with the CP clinic in 1995. Her knowledge is invaluable when it comes to assisting families with funding equipment needs and she understands the ins and outs of Medicaid and other funding resources. Debra Birdwell, RN, BSN, joined the team in 2018 as the clinic manager. Having worked with Dr. Sivamurthy from 2011-2015, caring for several special needs children on their panel, she shares his passion for the care of medically complex children. Debra manages all the providers that attend clinic, navigating the challenges of their different schedules and ensures an overall high degree of efficiency and efficacy. The mission and vision of the clinic: We are a multidisciplinary team that endeavors to support community-based efforts in managing medically complex children. We aim to be continually engaged and intervene as the medical, physical and social needs of the child and family evolve. The guiding principle for our clinic is the patient-centered medical home, which places the primary care provider as the lead partner. It is our firm belief that the care of our patients is incomplete without adequate care coordination through effective communication and continual process improvements.7ACTS of KINDNESS Employees of the KU Wichita Pediatrics Department were asked how they maintained their resilience during COVID-19 inside and outside the workplace. Here are a few of their stories. DEBORAH ALLISTON I have a \"Little Sister\" through Youth Horizons, so I bought her a gift and connected with her over the holidays. DEBRA DIEPENBROCK Over Thanksgiving, my family and I made 10 \"Blessing Bags\" to give out to homeless individuals. (These were reusable bags containing two water bottles, some nonperishable snacks, a blanket, a couple pairs of thick socks, a pair of gloves, deodorant and a Bible.) I gave out five or six of them between then and Christmas, and my parents and sister split the rest. KERRI WEEKS I serve on the board of the Wichita Children's Home. My family adopted a youth from WCH for Christmas. ALISA BRIDGE Our family tradition has been the Marine Corps toy collection every year and the local food bank. We have let Analisa, our daughter, pick out the toys for donation and ask her to fill a grocery cart. The last several years we have utilized the Toys for Tots drop-off at Menards. We do the same for the food bank and fill a cart at Sam's or Costco to donate. In Salina, I belonged to knitting groups through the local yarn store and my church. I invited them to help me make scarves and hats for the homeless shelters in town. We set a goal of 50 items per year among us. I miss doing that, so I started doing it on my own here after Thanksgiving. So far, I have three items completed. I hope to have a dozen by next fall to donate. I would welcome anyone who would like to participate in making items to donate. MARK HARRISON I have been serving on the USD 375 Gating Committee, helping make decisions on how the school district keeps the students and staff safe. KARI HARRIS We opened a school-based health clinic in Valley Center. CHARLOTTE BUCHANNAN I gave blood donations four times during the pandemic. NISHA AGASTHYA I have donated to the Kansas Food Bank during the holidays. BOB WITTLER I have been working with the Wichita diocese Catholic School superintendent and a group of other committee members to assess and evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the schools and make recommendations regarding in-school with mitigation measures or remote learning. I also will be meeting with teachers virtually to discuss any concerns or questions about receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. Additionally, I have given multiple media presentations to local TV stations concerning questions related to the pandemic. VANESSA JONES During the pandemic I have given convalescent plasma twice. Our family provided an entire Thanksgiving meal to a family in need. I have also been making donations to the food pantry set up in the clinic where I currently work. ANDREW ORMOND Blood donation through the Red Cross, Kansas Air National Guard state COVID-19 support missions for testing and immunizations, and visits to homebound individuals. ANONYMOUS My husband and I have donated substantially to the Kansas Food Bank in Wichita, which is part of Feeding America. We are also Leadership Circle members of classical radio here in Wichita. We adopted a dog from Kansas K9 ResQ in November. We have begun the process of being approved to adopt a child from foster care. LILLIAN BLUE I crochet cradles and prayer hearts for Bridget's Cradles; the founder is in Wichita. They give these to hospitals across the nation, which then give to families when their babies are born into heaven. For Milestones online wichita.kumc. edu/pediatrics/ newsletter3243 E.
