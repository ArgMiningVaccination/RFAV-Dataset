All Rights Tourism OcialRajasthan is not just about forts and palaces but it also has, amazing food, silver jewels and more. Rajasthan is a destination that combines adventure and relaxation, and makes for an unforgettable holiday. It's not just about forts and palaces; it goes beyond that with a little something for every kind of traveller. From tree houses to adventurous escapades, you will be amazed at all the experiences Rajasthan has to oer. Department of Tourism, Government of Rajasthan Sumptuous palaces, mag- nificent fortresses, the world's oldest rock, a boiling cauldron of a desert, a thriving palace culture, a glori-ous tribal heritage, the striped apex predator of the Indian jungle, a kaleidoscope of folk heritage and a multi-layered canvas of arts and crafts. Yes, Rajasthan certainly summons up all these grand visuals. But there are so many layers left to peel away to explore and mar- vel at those fresh discoveries to understand ever more deeply what is it that has us in thrall of this land. From the carnival scenes of its multiple festivals to the ex- otic pageantry of its regal pro- cessions, from the unique culi- nary offerings of its geographic diversity to the grammar of its fabulous architecture and d\u00e9-cor, there are gleaming gems and stories which still need to be distilled. Capitalising on the scope of its history, heritage and cultur-al diversity, and richly empow-ered by the deep and energetic appeal of its 'exotic otherness' for inquisitive travellers from around the globe, Rajasthan has stepped into the new era with an edgy amalgamation of new-age pursuits and predi-lections of the past, even as it chooses to remain firmly root- ed in its core values. Mobilising the entire gamut of its resources from its histori- cal and architectural marvels to the multi-textured tapestry of its local traditions and heritage and rituals and customs, Rajasthan entices you to plunder afresh the riches of its astonishing trea-sury of cultural experiences. RAJASTHAN REIMAGINEDinTroducing rajasThan age ranee sahaneY The prestige that a UNES- CO World Heritage Site citation carries is never treated lightly by nations across the globe. Not only does this recognition underscore a site's importance in the world's his- tory and as a beacon of cultural veracity for future generations, its role of conservation and preservation also underpins its significance as a repository of historical provenance and uni-versal cultural value. A UNESCO-acclamation of this nature falls under three different categories: Natural, Cultural and Mixed and for each there are certain criteria that need to be met. Natural Heritage recognition is given for a superlative natural phenomena; the site should contain the most important and significant natural habitats for in-situ conservation of biological diversity, including those containing threatened species of outstanding universal value from the point of view of science or environmental conservation. Built heritage represents a society's most important cultural assets, for it is emblematic of the multiple historical layers of our built environment made from materials such as brick, plaster, wood, metal and stone. Built heritage can be of importance to any one community, person, group, nation or group of nations. Heritage of this nature can include monuments, temples and churches, palaces and mansions, hotels and museums, markets and stepwells, railways and bridges and even historically significant archaeological sites. Intangible heritage recogni- tion rests on the unique or at least exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition or to a civilisa- tion which is living or which has disappeared. Significantly, Rajasthan is host to sites that bear recognition of UNESCO-acclamation in all three categories. Keoladeo Ghana National Park , formerly known as the Bharatpur Bird Sanctuary, was declared a World Heritage Site in 1985. In 1981, it became one of the first wetlands in the country to be listed as a Ramsar Site and was established as a National Park in 1982, to follow a strict conservation agenda. This former duck-hunting reserve of the Maharajas is one of the major wintering areas for large numbers of aquatic birds from Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, China and Siberia. Some 375 species of birds, including the rare Siberian crane, along with a diverse array of other life forms, have been recorded in this mosaic of grasslands, woodlands, woodland swamps and wetlands of just 2,873 ha. In 2010, the Jantar Mantar in Jaipur was ranked among the seven sites in the world which have been added to UNESCO's World Heritage list. Imbued with religious significance, it was used by ancient Indian astronomers to understand the workings of celestial phenomenon such as predicting eclipses, tracking the location of the stars as the earth orbits around the sun, following the positioning of constellations and determining the celestial altitudes and ephemeris. Also, in 2010, UNESCO inscribed the Kalbelia folk songs and dances of Rajasthan on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, as they are an expression of the Kalbelia community's traditional way of life.

In 2013, the Hill Forts of Rajasthan were identified as a UNESCO-acclaimed World Heritage Site; this for Rajasthan's military architecture. Located in different cities, as a serial cultural property, this recognition was the first of its kind ever by UNESCO. As a series, the six components together form a complete and coherent group in themselves to amply demonstrate the attributes of Outstanding Universal Value. Ranking among the latest additions to the list of UNESCO-acclaimed World Heritage Sites in India, Jaipur city joined this exclusive set of built-up heritage structures on June 6, 2019. Brimming over with old-world nuances, this charming city, painted a salmon pink, offers a bewitching experience to visitors from around the globe. In a recent move, UNESCO and the state government joined hands to promote community-based responsible tourism based on the rich Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) of the state. UNESCO-acclaimed Intangible (Living) Heritage assets encompass traditions, crafts, folklore associated with a particular place, music, dance, rituals, cuisines and other symbolic cultural identities. This project, aimed at promoting the longstanding Rajasthani traditions and adding new cultural destinations is planned to run for about three-and-a-half years, and will be implemented in Jodhpur, Barmer, Jaisalmer and Bikaner. By leveraging the intangible cultural heritage offerings of the state, like the songs of Langas, Manganiyars, Mirs and Bhopas, Kalbelia and Gair dances, dhurrie making and appliqu\u00e9 work carried out in the villages, it is a win-win situation, both for the tourism sector in new product develop-ment and benefitting rural artists' communities and safeguarding the art forms that have been around for centuries. steps leading up to the regal amer FortFood Rajasthan 17 specialsspecials 18 RajasthanFood Rajasthan 19 deYvaansh Misra It is an absolute marvel to witness the sheer ingenuity and artistry of Rajasthani cuisine, an enduring testament to the skill and grim determi-nation of the people who have made their homes in this large- ly arid land. Rajasthan stands as a unique case study\u2014where many ancient Indian civilisa- tions flourished in the most resource-filled areas, these peo-ple created a powerful, com-plex, layered and regal culture among sandy dunes. The arid and often unforgiving land here made nothing easy\u2014the paucity of large swathes of fer- tile soil meant fewer vegetables, and practically no leafy greens whatsoever; a definite chal-lenge for a state that tradition- ally was, and continues to be, largely vegetarian. An important fact to note is that different communities dominated different parts of Rajasthan, and while they used the same ingredients for the large part and even had many similar preparations, their different sensibilities created multiple branches of the exact same cuisine. The primary divisions are the Rajputs, who were a fiercely proud warrior caste famed for their code of honour and fearlessness in the face of battle; the Vaishnavs, who were followers of Vishnu and strongly devout in their faith; the Bishnois, a conservative spiritualist sect found mostly in the desert areas who believe in the conservation of all life; the Marwaris, an ethno-linguistic group who hail from the Marwar region and are prolific merchants; and the Jains, a relative minority who ascribe to the ancient tenets of Jainism. Only the Rajputs used to partake in meat and even then not frequently, usually preferring to keep a vegetarian and lacto-vegetarian diet. Every other ethnic group and tribals such as Bhils, Bavris and Sansis in Rajasthan abstained from meat and partook of a rigid vegetarian diet that made use of local produce, both domestic and wild, and extensively relied on dairy products as both the base for curries and for cooking. Water is one of the most premium commodities in any desert economy, hence the use of water for cooking was considered wasteful and irresponsible. Instead, milk, yoghurt and ghee were used as a medium of cooking. In the absence of a variety in vegetables, hardy grains like millet, wheat and gram became staples, along with lentils, legumes, beans and berries. Since fuel like wood and coal was rare and expensive and often not available for days, food had to have a long shelf life and needed to be easily edible without requiring any heating or further preparation. These durable recipes were also preferred because of the necessity of travel for the menfolk, who were away from home for several days at a stretch, mostly for work or trade. THE GlORIOUS FOOD OF RAJASTHAN a rajasthani thali Photographs by shutterstockspecials 20 RajasthanFood Rajasthan 21Interestingly, Rajasthani cuisine remains one of the most untouched fares in India, which means that there is relatively little influence from foreign trade, invaders and powers. Flavours, ingredients and T echniques The Rajasthanis cultivated hardy grains like millet, maize, jowar and ragi, as they used less water and lasted much longer in storage. The growth of wheat and vegetables was restricted to the more fertile areas. They learnt to use any and all resources for consumption, which is the basis for the mouthwatering delicacy ker sangri. Ker are wild berries which have a tangy and peppery finish, while sangri are wild beans that grow abundantly in the desert. They are cooked together in water or buttermilk along with an assortment of spices and are an integral part of Marwari cuisine. Rajasthani cuisine is characterised by its extensive and impeccable use of spices, as they can be grown and cultivated easily. Condiments like tamarind, coriander, cumin, sesame, turmeric, ginger, mango powder), cinnamon, nigella seeds, aniseed, cloves, asafoetida, dried fenugreek and, most importantly, red chillies, are used to create intricate recipes that burst with flavour, elevating otherwise humble ingredients to lofty dimensions. These are generally powdered in a heavy iron mortar and pestle just before they are added to the food, so that they retain their coarse texture and natural flavour. They have mastered the art of drying condiments to preserve their flavour and longevity, and dried red chillies from Rajasthan are highly sought after across the country. Further proof of Rajasthani ingenuity when it comes to adding flavour can be found in their incredible range of chutneys, from the tomato to the tamarind. They have also perfected the art of making papad, a thin, crisp disc-shaped savoury confection made from flour that can last for months. Snacks like the ubiquitous kachori, a truly delicious fried savoury or sweet pastry stuffed with various ingredients, most famously onion and mawa, are the stars of the street food culture here. Unmissable in this repertoire is the vast range of Rajasthani desserts. Due to their prowess in the use of dairy, they have concocted scintillating sweets that utterly enchant the taste buds. These include the unique ghevar, a crunchy cake-like dish made from flour, soaked in ghee, milk and topped with sliced almonds, malpua, kheer, halwa and laddus. A technique of cooking particular to Rajasthan and inspired by the war-like nature of their expeditions is the pit cooking method, wherein the food is prepared in pits dug out in the sand. Another interesting indigenous practice is that of dungar cooking, wherein the prepared food is placed in a vessel (usually a bronze or copper pot) and a small container with a hot piece of coal is kept in the centre of the dish inside the vessel. Hot ghee is then poured onto the coal and the dish is covered for 30 minutes, giving the dish an intoxicating smoky flavour and aroma. The royal heritage of cuisine in rajasthan The royal households of Rajasthan (called rajthikanas or rajasthani food \u2014 a smorgasbord of spices, colours and textures a traditional clay stove specials 22 RajasthanFood Rajasthan 23rajgharanas) were famed for their lavish expenditure and their often ludicrously extravagant lifestyles. There was also a deep-rooted culture of competition where royal households vied with each other to see which was the most affluent and opulent. It was in the magnificent kitchens of these royal families that some of the richest and most flavourful dishes find their origins. Each royal gharana had a huge rasoda (kitchen) that usually had no economic restraints, and employed a minimum of 10 to 12 chefs, called rasoiyas. Dry fruits were considered the epitome of delicacies and each king in Rajasthan had a particular allowance of dry fruits. This system was so complex and rigid that one of the best ways to judge the might, influence and wealth of a royal family was through their dry fruit ration! Food was a show of status, and the unrelenting one- upmanship among the royal kitchens is the stuff of legends. It was during royal banquets that the true flair of the kitchen would see the limelight. The central attraction would usually be something exotic that would have been created specifically for that celebration. These were presented in elaborate vessels made from the rarest of precious materials. The regular daily fare of the royal family, while rich in va-riety and flavour, was usually vegetarian and incorporated simple local ingredients pre- pared exquisitely. Recipes were fiercely guarded by the chefs who would rather die than reveal their culinary secrets. This has led to a despairing loss of most of these incredible and unique recipes over time. Thankfully, there has been a strong resurgence of some of these forgotten recipes as the descendants of the royal families have started sharing these recipes with the proletariat. There is so much history and cultural significance involved in Rajasthani food that it boggles the mind. piles of Fes Tivals dharMendar Kanwar Some of the most vibrant and fondest memories of my growing-up years are those linked to festivals. Perhaps this is so for many Indians\u2014our childhoods are captured in moments that re- fuse to grow sepia-tinted with years, preferring instead to don the shades of pinks, blues and greens of raucous Holi, or the golden hues of the lit lamps of Diwali, flickering even in the soft focus of a memory. This is all the more so if, like me, you have grown up in Rajast- han. For, in the arid landscape of the desert, the grand festi- vals were what imbued in us a sense of colour, adding to the parched terrain a vibrant beau-ty that Mother Nature herself did not bestow. I remember that the prepara- tions for festivals, big or small, were always elaborate. The house would be decorated with intricate mandanas, or flour pat- terns on the floor; the rooms would be cleaned till they sparkled; the women would un- dertake fasts and we would all troop down to the temple to listen to a tale or sing bhajans and to marvel at the sights and sounds of the mela at the vil-lage square. Those are glorious memories, one that I am always willing to reflect on, and it is so for most Rajasthanis. Hardly a month passes by without a festival being cel-ebrated in one part of the state or the other. As in the rest of the country, the festivals have religious and mythological, seasonal or historical signifi-cance. Perhaps what's more unique to Rajasthan is the enormous number of tradition- al fairs that continue to be held today. These double as photo- opportunities for tourists to see the 'real Rajasthan', but also remain at heart an opportunity for villagers to get together, do business and relax in the com- pany of their brethren\u2014just as it was decades ago. If the fair is a religious one, then prayers and processions form an integral part of the cel-ebrations. There are also festi-vals associated with changing seasons\u2014some to welcome the monsoon or spring, to seek the blessings of the rain gods for ensuring a plentiful harvest or to thank them if the yield is indeed good. It is worth men-tioning here that the fairs are more than what they seem to be from the outside; apart from being an occasion for prayer or thanksgiving, these help in creating a sense of cohesion and solidarity among the com- munity. Be that as it may, the joyous spirit of each and ev-ery festival remains the same, as is reflected in the colourful clothes of the people, in the bustling bazaars and in the en-thusiasm with which cattle and grain are traded, or in the brisk haggling over handicrafts and clothes and household items. Here are some of the most pop- ular fairs and festivals of the royal state of Rajasthan. Makar sankranti In the first quarter of the year, Jaipur gears up to celebrate FAIRS & FESTIv AlS Holika Dahan takes place on Dhulandi Fes val of Makar Sankranti, which falls on January 14. This marks the sun's entry into the Northern Hemisphere and also signals the end of winter. On this day, the sky is dotted with thousands of colourful paper kites as families gather on rooftops playing loud mu- sic and watching kite fights. People pray for a good harvest on this day and offerings of til and khichdi are made to the Sun god. Beneshwar Fair Celebrated at the end of January or the first week of February in Dungarpur, the Beneshwar Fair sees a huge gathering of tribal communities. Beneshwar means the 'master of the delta', the local name that has been given to a shivlinga at the Mahadeo Temple in Dungarpur. Tribal communities in the neighbouring states of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh also hold Beneshwar sacred. On the occasion of the fair, thousands of devotees gather at the confluence of the Som and Mahi rivers, where the fair is held. They sing folk songs, sometimes around bonfires at night, and there are all the other ingredients of a mela on display as well: dances, acrobatics and some magic to boot. sheetla Mata Mela In a small village called Chaksu, located close to Jaipur, crowds gather in March to honour the Goddess Sheetla Mata at her shrine. Food cooked the night before is offered to pacify the goddess, who is believed to have the power to prevent dis-eases. A small cattle fair is held at this time and a market is also set up for villagers to trade in utensils and tools. The differ-ent means of transport that the devotees use to reach the mela is a sight worth seeing: buses, jeeps, tractors, camel and bull-ock carts, cycles and scooters. In the open ground around the hilltop temple to the god- dess, people keep themselves entertained by singing and lots of dancing.Bati's being prepared at Beneshwar Fair Rajasthan has several cattle and camel fairs in addition to its festivals. In some cases, cattle fairs are an integral part of the festivals themselves. We list a few of them below: pushkar Fair Every year in the Hindu month of Kartik (usually November), Pushkar comes alive with traders, tourists, photographers, musicians, artists and devotees, who come here to celebrate the week-long extravaganza. While the fair means serious business for those in the camel and cattle trade, for tourists and locals, it's an opportunity to relive their childhood nostalgia of enjoying the amusements of a desi fair. The event can be seen as a conglomeration of different fairs. There's the world-famous cattle fair, there's the religious part of it which involves taking a holy dip to wash away one's sins, and then there's the fun and frolic. From traditional folk dances, circuses, magic shows, and camelback rides to ferris wheels, lively processions, and shopping for ornate swords and Rajasthani juttis, the fair promises to be an experience that will stay with you forever. Nagaur Fair The Nagaur Fair, like the Pushkar Fair, is one of the largest animal fairs in Rajasthan. It is held January/February and is renowned for the trading of cows, bullocks, oxen, camel and horses. The animals are decorated colourfully and the owners dress up equally lavishly. One of the main attractions is a chilli bazaar\u2014Nagaur is known for its red chillies. Bikaner camel Festival The year starts on a lively note with the Camel Festival in Bikaner held in January, organised by the Tourism Department. There are parades, races and dances by camels during the festival, which is spread over two days. Folk art performances, including fire dances, are also organised during this time. By Karan Kaushik The images of Gauri and Ishar (Shiva) are carried in palanquins, with decorated camels, horses and smartly dressed attendants for company. In the final ritual, the clay or wood images of the gods are immersed in a holy tank or lake. The lake city ofUdaipur holds the most cul- turally evocative festivities of Gangaur. It is known as the Mewar Festival in Udaipur. The celebrations are led across Lake Pichola by the royal barge from the City Palace to Gangaur Ghat where the ritu-al immersion of the images of Gauri and Ishar takes place.urs Held in Ajmer, Urs falls on the first six days of Rajab (the seventh month of the Islamic calendar). Thousands of devo-tees of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti, popularly known as Gharib Nawaz, gather here and pay homage to this saint, whose mortal remains are bur-ied here. Smaller gatherings are organised in Nagaur, Tala and Galiyakot. The pilgrims make offerings called nazrana to the saint, consisting of roses, jas- mines and perfumes. Qawwali performances take place during this time and are a must-see. Kheer is distributed to devo- Fairs & Fes Tivals specials The festive and elaborate Gangaur procession Kaila devi Fair The Kaila March-April, is dedi- cated to Goddess Chamunda. This fair lasts 12 days and at-tracts devotees from all over the state. For days, the roads leading to this small temple town are jammed with bus-loads of pilgrims. Devotees cover the distance on foot or by lying prostrate and then pulling themselves ahead. The temple courtyard resounds with songs as religious pro- cessions from nearby towns come together here. There is also shopping for the visitors at the fair.Mahavirji Fair Held in honour of the 24th Jain tirthankara Mahavir in March-April, this fair is where thousands of pilgrims from West Bengal, Assam, Bihar and South India congregate to offer their salutations. The venue is the Mahavirji Shrine at Chandangaon in Karauli district. A cobbler is believed to have discovered the lord's image, now kept at the shrine, buried underground centu-ries ago. During the fair, the image is carried in a golden chariot drawn by two bull- ocks to the banks of the river Gambhiri. Pilgrims escort the chariot to the river and back, singing devotional songs. Af-ter the image is returned to the shrine, the festivity con- tinues. Shops are set up dur- ing the fair, offering goods and knick-knacks to visitors. gangaur This is a festival celebrated by women across Rajasthan in March-April, on the day after Holi, and is spread over 18 days. The name Gangaur is a combination of the names of Lord Shiva\u2014Gan being one of his names\u2014and his consort Parvati, or Gauri. Many elabo-rate rituals are performed as part of the festival. In Jaipur, the highlight of the festival is the colourful procession that is taken out from Tripo- lia Gate to Chaugan and then pilgrims at the ajmer Dargh during Ursspecials 30 RajasthanFairs & two huge cauldrons or degs. gogaji In a small village near Nohar in Hanumangarh district, a fair is held in August to honour a folk deity known as Gogaji Veer, popularly recognised as the God of Snakes. Revered by both Hindus and Muslims, the spot where Gogaji took sama-dhi is known as Goga Medi. Ev-ery year, thousands of devotees gather here to pay homage. The fair lasts for three days and at-tracts visitors from neighbour-ing states as well. There is a belief among the devotees that Gogaji can cure their diseases and many visitors come here to offer thanks when their wishes are fulfilled. T eej This is a celebration that starts in the monsoon month of Shravan, as the desert region gets ready to welcome the first drops of rain that will bring a rush of green to the land- scape. The third day, or Teej of Shravan, is celebrated in a big way in Rajasthan. The fes-tival is dedicated to the union of Parvati and Shiva. Women dress in colours of green, re-flecting the lush environs with the arrival of the rains. In rural areas, the festivities begin weeks before the main day of Teej. New clothes are purchased, traditional sweets made and feasts organised. chandrabhaga Fair Held in November in Jhalra- patan, close to Jhalawar, this annual fair takes place on the banks of the river Chandrab-haga. On the full moon night of Kartik Purnima, people con- verge here to take a dip in the river and to offer prayers at the temple known as Chandrawati. A cattle fair is also held here, with cows, camels and bulls be- ing sold, and traders from other states join in too. ramdeoji Fair A folk deity revered in Runicha, a small village near Pokhran in Bhadra, Baba Ramdeoji or Ram Shah Pir was a 15th-century saint who hailed from the Tomar Rajput clan. Believed to have been an incarnation of Lord Krishna by the Hindus, Ramdeoji is worshipped for having performed miracles to help the poor. In a fair that lasts for 10 days in August and September, lakhs of devotees gather at Ramdeora to bathe in the Ramsar Tank, believed to have been constructed by the saint himself, and pay homage at his shrine-samadhi. In this religious fair, pilgrims spend most of their time singing devotional songs. The saint is said to have loved horses and to propitiate him today, devotees buy stuffed toy horses and offer these at the temple. An attraction at the fair is the performance of terah taali by the members of the Kamad community. In this, two men relate the history of Ramdeoji to the accompaniment of the one-stringed iktara, and two women perform a dance. The performance can last through the night. Matsya Festival, alwar Matsya festival is celebrated each year on 25- 26 November to nurture the local art, culture and heritage of Alwar. Folk Devotees at a temple in runicha, near pokhran, for the ramdeora Fair swirling dancers in traditional costumes and finery on the occasion of Teejspecials 32 RajasthanFairs & Fes Tivals Rajasthan 33performances, adventure and local sports, paddle boat race, heritage walk in the old city, trekking around Bala Quila, Bhapang music are the key highlights of this festival. Kolayat The full moon in the month of Kartik (October-November) has special religious significance and dozens of small religious fairs take place in villages all over the state during this time. One such is the Kapil Muni Fair at Kolayat near Bikaner, so called after the much-revered sage Kapil Muni, who is believed to have descend- ed from Lord Brahma. He is said to have prayed at the lake here and while pilgrims visit Kolayat through the year, a dip during the full moon is considered es- pecially sacred. It is thought that one day spent in Kolayat is equivalent to 10 years spent in other sacred places. A beauti- fully located temple dedicated to Kapil Muni and 52 shaded ghats add to the sanctity of the atmo- sphere. A cattle fair is also held at this time when prizes are given for the best breeders of camels, horses and cattle. dussehra Fair, Kota Second only to Mysuru's Dussehra in grandeur, The Du- shhera Festival of Kota attracts lakhs of visitors every year. The city has been celebrating this grand fiesta for more than 125 years now, making it an inte-gral part of its cultural heritage. What makes this event special are the colossal effigies of Raa- van, his brother Kumbhakaran and his son Meghnad. Created by skilled artists, the ten-head-ed Raavan effigy is around 75 feet tall and continues to be the biggest draw of the event. jaipur literature Festival A flagship event in Jaipur's annual events calendar, the globally renowned Jaipur Literature Festival is a fabulous 'feast of ideas' held in January/February in the state capital. For five days the Diggi Palace in Jaipur glows brighter with festive hues and thrums with sounds of joy, as the literati and the glitterati converge on the Pink City from around the world. Each day starts with soothing morning ragas, followed by talks and panels on curated topics. Those into retail therapy hit the vibrant festival bazaars, an initiative to support artisans, craftsmen and young entrepreneurs. rajasthan international Folk Festival This festival in Jodhpur is a five-day roots music extrava- ganza, and offers the breath- taking backdrop of the grand Mehrangarh Fort to colourful folk traditions from across the world.

Sets featuring rare musical instruments from lesser-known European coun-tries, Africa and Latin America, and quirky fusions with cross- cultural influences are also a regularity. With Mewati folk and Armenian-Swiss jazz and reggae and Indian funk rock playing in the same festival, even those with the most off- beat musical tastes find their jam here. shekhawati Festival, nawalgarh This festival is held in February in the painted town of Nawalgarh. Visitors are taken in jeeps and on camel safaris and cultural programmes are held. They are also introduced to Shekhawati's heritage\u2014the organisers hope that this move will work both ways and encourage the owners to preserve their havelis.

Meant to showcase Rajasthan's rich cultural heri- tage, the festival features folk dances and folk music performances set against the backdrop of the gorgeous sand dunes of Sam, near Jaisalmer. Camel races are also part of the festival. The entire city is decorated to receive visitors from all over the country. The golden fort here is illumi-nated and is a sight to behold. Bundi Festival Held in the Hindu calendar month of Kartik (October-November), the Bundi Festival is a major draw for tourists, with its popular ritual procession called the Shobha Yatra, an arts and crafts fair, turban contests, traditional sports, and folk dance and music performances.

The Sambhar Salt Lake is not so much a lake as a vast depression. A body of sand, saline and isolated pockets of water that straddles three districts (Nagaur, Jaipur and Ajmer) of Rajasthan, it spreads over an area of 190 sq km. For most of the year the lake remains dry. After the monsoons, a thin film of water covers the western reservoir, attracting thousands of local migrants like the greater and lesser flamingoes, painted storks and spot- billed pelicans. Huge colonies of birds congregate in the centre of the reservoir, shimmering in the haze that plays on the waters. By October the water recedes to a few small pools (the rest has either evaporated or been diverted to the salt pans in the eastern reservoir), leaving behind treacherously wet sand that is ideal terrain for waders such as pied avocets, Kentish plovers and black-winged stilts. It's also when the flamingoes breed, building their circular, 1-foot-high nests in areas near Ratan Talao. During the day, birds can be found feeding in the salt pans and freshwater ponds near the Jhapok Dam and pools near Sambhar Town. Come November, migratory birds start flying in. November to mid- March is also the best time to come to Sambhar \u2014 the cool sunny days allow for many hours of wandering. By this time, substantial areas of the lake would have dried out, making it easier to walk or drive on its bed, and get closer to the birds. It's also less dusty, and the pockets of babul trees that emerge where the compacted mud of the lake bed gives way to looser desert sand are still green. It starts getting hot in Sambhar towards the end of March. Dust-laden winds start blowing across the desert, the lake dries up and most of the birds leave.

It's a shallow wetland with depths varying from 1.6-6.6ft. Migratory birds such as pochards, waders and flamingoes are found here in large numbers. The lake has been designated a Ramsar Site in 1990 and was also identified as one of the sites for conservation action under the Indian Wetland Conservation Programme. It is one of the two Ramsar sites in Rajasthan - the other one is the Keoladeo National Bird Sanctuary at Bharatpur. Sambhar Salt Lake is owned by the state, but a large part of it is leased to Sambhar Salts Limited. Salt manufacturing units have reportedly adversely affected the lake's ecosystem.

The lake is best visited between October and February \u2014 the time when most migratory birds can be found congregating here.

So you can to hire a jeep from Sambhar Town for a day. Birdwatching If you want to do some serious birding, you should give yourself at least three to four days when in Sambhar. Given the size of the lake, and the fact that pockets of water can be extremely localised and far apart, so a good pair of binoculars can be very helpful. Try to get a detailed map of the lake from Sambhar Salts Limited if you are going to be driving around on your own. A local driver may prove to be more familiar with the terrain so it might be worth your while to hire one from the town.

It only became a full-fledged town after Nawal Singh's two grandsons decided to make it their home at the close of the 18th century. Mandawa attracted many merchants to set up shop. Of interest here are the murals of Gulab Rai Ladia Haveli, which are quite exceptional, especially in the variety of their themes.

A rather nationalistic tug-of-war between a strongman called Prof Ramamurti and a motorcar driven by an Englishman is also portrayed in a painting.

The Bissau of Shekhawati\u2014like most small towns in the post-colonial world \u2014 seems trapped in a triple time warp. The 250-year-old Keshargarh Fort here was built in 1746 by Keshri Singh, one of the five sons of the legendary Sardul Singh, who ended three centuries of Muslim ascendancy over large parts of Shekhawati. It proclaims its medieval origins with impressive bastions; the stylised caricatures of Europeans on haveli walls betray its brush with colonialism; the bazaar, with shops selling Coke and electronic goods, advertises its chaotic leap into modernity. One can amble through the bazaar and drink in the town's distinctly provincial ambience\u2014low-key, unhurried and fatalistic. Ironically, until the latter half of the 19th century, Bissau\u2014along with the other towns of Shekhawati \u2014was a flourishing and prosperous town.

Founded in 1737 by Nawal Singh, a son of Shardul Singh, Nawalgarh was able to attract a number of rich Marwari merchants who built many richly painted havelis here. Most of these are in a state of disrepair now, the China. The Thakurs and the business community enjoyed a symbiotic relationship \u2014 the Thakurs protected the trade from brigands, in lieu of which the merchants paid a 'security fee'. Little wonder, then, that the entrepreneurs of this region (often wrongly clubbed with the Marwaris from Marwar, the erstwhile Jodhpur Estate) amassed great fortunes until the rise of the British Empire and the dominance of its imported goods destroyed this trade. Gradually, most of the merchant families\u2014the Goenkas, Poddars, Singhanias, Ruias and Birlas\u2014 migrated to the port towns of Kolkata and Mumbai, slowly establishing a stranglehold over commerce between India and Britain. The tradition in those days was that whoever made it good would come back and build four things: a haveli, a baoli, a mandir and a dharamshala. With their multiplying wealth, they went on erecting colleges, cenotaphs, grander and grander havelis and\u2014finally, when nothing else could be thought of\u2014ordered that the havelis be painted. This competitive grandeur was also a way of spoiling the families they had to leave back at home for long periods.

Although the haveli is not very old\u2014it was built around the 1920s\u2014the murals have been carefully restored to their original glory. As for the other murals, it seems the Nawalgarh artists had much greater freedom in choosing their themes. For instance, there are pirated editions of Ravi Varma's works and imaginative illustrations of a whole range of early-20th century technologies such as the air balloon, the Wright brothers' attempt at flight, motorcars, modern railways and sewing machines. But in terms of artistic brilliance, the painted ceiling of a small room in the fort called Bala Quila stands out. The room, studded profusely with mirrors, is circular, about 8ft in diameter and almost as high. The murals, lustrous and colourful, depict an artist's impression of the cities and armies of Jaipur and Nawalgarh in the 1850s. Aath Haveli is where you can see a long train with one passenger in every compartment, a woman feeding a child and at the same time doing her make-up. Morarka Haveli is right across the back street from Aath Haveli, and has one of the most elegantly and finely sketched paintings. Two prominent frames show the celebration of traditional festivals like Teej and Gangaur.

The 19th century saw an extraordinary migration of rich merchants from the neighbouring states to the Sikar, Jhunjhunu and Churu districts and they used their great wealth to create these havelis. Artists from Jaipur and Udaipur moved in to adorn the walls of the structures with exquisite details - of the world around them, and of the many moods of their favourite deities. Modelled to resemble Jaipur in terms of its city plan, Sikar was once the richest thikana or feudal state under Jaipur. An array of impressive havelis, beautifully frescoed temples, grand buildings and a massive fort dot the city, making it a sheer delight for the intrepid traveller. Sikar was ruled by the Shekhawats, who were the descendants of Tirmalji, the brother of Bhojraj, who was the great great grandfather of the illustrious Maharaja Sardul Singh. While some historians believe that Sikar was founded in 1687, most are of the opinion that it was in 1724 when Sheo Singh laid its foundation. He is credited with building the palace, the fort, and the first town walls. With the support of Sardul Singh, Sheo Singh evicted the Kaimkhani Nawab of Fatehpur and expanded the boundaries of the thikana. Later, Devi Singh added to it by building the impressive Deogarh Fort, some 8km south-east of Sikar. Devi Singh's heir Singh founded Lakshmangarh. By the early 19th century, Sikar flourished as the wealthiest baron under the Jaipur state, with the Biyanis being the main merchant family. The havelis built by them stand as a testament to the venerable past of Sikar. Archaeological evidence however suggests that Sikar is a far more ancient site. For instance, a well near the Fatehpur Gate in the district features a stele bearing the date 1278. Places like Ganeshwar and Baleshwar are believed to have been a part of the pre-Harappan period, which makes them must-visit attractions for all history and archaeology enthusiasts.

The Matsya kingdom, for instance, figures in the Mahabharata. Historians are divided on the origin of the modern name, 'Alwar'. Some say it is a corruption of Salwapur, Salwa being the name of a tribe that lived here. Others say it is a corruption of Aravalpur, Aravalis being the hill range running through the district. Still others see it as a corruption of Alpur, the name of the city founded by Maharaja Alaghraj in 1049. Legends apart, the oldest extant thing in the city today is the Bala Quila, Alwar built by the Nikumbha Rajputs in the 10th century. The fort spreads over the surrounding hills, which, along with the nearby lakes, are Alwar's most alluring assets. If you come in the rains, they are bright green; if you come in the dry season, they are ruddy and rocky. All that rock has been put to good use in and around Alwar. Forts, tombs and palaces abound. It is said that as Alwar was the youngest kingdom in Rajputana\u2014it came into existence in 1775\u2014its rulers never tired of pomp and pageantry to make their mark amid the older kingdoms. This should explain why they built 52 forts and innumerable palaces in the 175-odd years that they ruled. Modern Alwar is a repository of much of that heritage. Wandering around the town's old streets, one realises how much there is to cherish in Alwar, and how little the outside world knows about it. Things To see and do You can do all the sightseeing in Alwar in a day, but don't take this to mean that there is little of note in the town.

A short walk away from Moti Doongri, towards the railway line, stands RR College, once known as the Vinay Vilas Palace. The building is worth a look from up close, and from here, you can head to Company Bagh or Purjan Vihar as it is called. This is a beautiful garden with a large, domed summer house, called Shimla, set in a trough amidst the rich verdure. Maharaja Sheodan Singh laid out the garden in 1868, and Maharaja Mangal Singh built Shimla in 1885. Locals take great pride in Shimla, which has walkways and fountains.u Company Bagh Entry Free Timings All day Summer House timings 5am-10pm From Company Bagh, head up the Church Road, past the stone-built St Andrew's Church, which is usually locked. By evening, Church Road is a busy market, but in the morning, you can stop and admire the old havelis here. At the end of the road lies Hope Circus, a traffic island with shops on the street level and a temple above. Four streets radiate outwards from the circle. The one lane from Church Road leads to the Clock Tower and has the Kalakand Market strung along it. The fourth street from Church Road leads to the Tripolia Gateway and on to the City Palace complex. From outside, Tripolia looks like an unremarkable gateway, but small shrines have been built into its corners. On either side of the gate, while going towards City Palace, are old markets, called Sarafa Bazaar and Bajaja Bazaar. Both are famous for the gold ornaments sold at the shops. You will also find beautiful havelis along the way. city palace The City Palace complex is accessed through a gateway with projecting balconies on either side. Beyond the gate lies an open ground with Mahal chowk and Janana Mahal on the right side. The City Palace, Sagar, a tank, and Moosi Rani ki Chhatri are located just behind this part. Morning is the best time to visit City Palace as the sun shines directly on its fa\u00e7ade. The building has been completely taken over by state government offices, the Alwar Collectorate and the police superintendent's office. Still, apart from admiring the architecture and ornamentation of this late-18th-century palace built in 1793 by Raja Bakhtawar Singh, visitors can climb up to the museum at the top. It has three sections: the first hall has royal robes and clay toys, an interesting exhibit here being the bicycle belonging to Maharaja Jai Singh with three hub gears and brakes built into its pedals. The second hall is a storehouse of paintings, including large canvases of notable historical personalities. The third has a display of weapons; and placed without obvious distinction among other weapons are the swords of the Mughal emperors Akbar and Jahangir. Marvelling at the exquisite murals and fine mirrorwork on the walls and the ceilings of City Palace takes much of the visitor's time. Behind the palace lies the large tank called Sagar, which has two-tiered, domed pavilions set around it. Steps go down to the water, which was used for ritual bathing in the old days. Feeding pigeons is a tradition here. Across the water is a string of temples, and on the right, the beautiful marble and Karauli sandstone cenotaph of Raja Bakhtawar Singh. But it is named after his consort, Rani Moosi. One can also visit a small temple located at one end of the water body and maybe even spot a sambar here! u Govt.

It is a sprawling building with a beautiful Ram temple inside. The palace boasts over a hundred rooms and a lush ground in its premises. The structure cannot be seen from the front but you can get a good view from the shore of the lake behind it. The road past the lake leads to Bala Quila. Bala Quila The City Palace complex forms the eastern extremity of Alwar, and beyond it run the Aravalis, with Bala Quila standing guard atop them. The fort's walls spread out over the hills like tentacles, piercing the green cover in wild sweeps. Rising 304m above the city, the Bala Quila features 15 large and 51 small towers with their 446 outlets for musketry, which would have hailed fire and brimstone on many an enemy. The Mughal emperor Jahangir was once exiled (Salim Mahal) and his forefathers Akbar and Babur are believed to have stayed here overnight. The name Bala Quila (translating to 'Young Fort') is ironic, as it is the oldest extant structure in town, dated to 928 CE, when the Nikumbha Rajputs were in power. The 10-km drive up to the fort is rewarding in its own right. The road is good, the tree covers dense all along, and the majestic old wall, with steps built along it, surfaces periodically.

Bhangarh was constructed by Amber's Kachchwaha ruler Raja Bhagwat his son Madho Singh in 1537. Madho Singh's brother Man Singh was the fabled general of Emperor Akbar. Madho Singh, who was himself a Diwan at Akbar's court, was succeeded by his son Chhattar Singh. And with Chhattar Singh on the gaddi, Bhangarh's epic terror tale took birth.

It is said that in the last throes of his death, while being crushed by the huge boulder, the enraged Singhia roundly cursed her and the inhabitants of Bhangarh. The chhatri atop the hillside is his. A year later, there was a battle between Bhangarh and Ajabgarh, in which Ratnavati died. Soon after, the inhabitants of Bhangarh upped and left its cursed soil. Another tale linked to the ghost town is about a sage called Guru Balu Nath who used to live on the hilltop on which the fort is built. When the fort was being constructed, the sage gave the condition to the king that the fort should be built in such a way that it would not cast a shadow on his house. In the beginning, all Bhangarh's rulers respected this condition, but Raja Ajab Singh decided to add columns to the fort. As a result, the sage's residence was hidden under the shadow of the fort. The furious sage cursed the fort. Legends will live on, but historians opine that the population of Bhangarh diminished because Ajab Singh established a new fort after his father Chhattar Singh died. This was followed by a famine in 1783, which forced the rest of the villagers to leave the town. u Timings Sunrise to sunset Entry Charges: Indian `25, foreigners `300 where To sTaY & eaT For obvious reasons, you can stay and eat in Alwar.

The carvings here resemble those of the Chandelas of Khajuraho, and probably date to that time (9th-10th centuries). The Naldeshwar shrine nearby attracts pilgrims. Located just off the main way to Sariska from Alwar, Naldeshwar is an old Mahadev temple. The approach to the temple, surrounded by dense forests, can be accessed only by a 2-km long walk from the main road. Talvriksh, on the northern edge of the park, is another centre for pilgrimage in Rajasthan. It has a temple with hot and cold sources of water, and is close to the park on the Narayaniji Road. The Bhartrihari Temple, to the south of Kushalgarh in the sanctuary area, is famous all over Rajasthan for its fairs. The temple is located at the edge of the forest, though the throng of pilgrims undermine the pristine setting.

In 1958, the reserve was upgraded to a sanctuary, and later, areas contiguous to the sanctuary were also included. There are a slew of revenue villages and associated guadas or cattle camps inside its boundaries. The semi-arid Aravalli forest suffers from enormous human and livestock pressures. The huge number of pilgrims visiting the temples in Sariska has also adversely affected the forest. Things To see and do Sariska gives you a chance to see langur and nilgai and birds such as the white-breasted kingfisher. The locality also has places of historic interest. aravalli drive There are no government vehicles, so you'll need to rent a jeep (Gypsy) from a lodge or a travel agency if you don't have your own.

Just past the Tehla Road, a 15-km long track branches off to the north to Kankwari Fort. Passing through dense forest on the top of the Aravalli Ridge, this track leads to a point that gives an impressive view of Kankwari, a medieval fort standing on an isolated hill in the middle of a plateau. Kankwari has a bund with perennial water. It's believed that Aurangzeb imprisoned his brother Dara Shikoh here. Kankwari is worth a visit, with the splendid view it offers of the hilltop plateau.

Emperor Akbar annexed it to the Mughal Empire in the 16th century. It became, for the Mughals, first a centre of operations against the kingdoms of Rajasthan and Gujarat, and later, a pilgrimage site. The Mughal empresses and princesses spent time here, and invested this region with their trademark preferences. Nur Jahan, for instance, had roses cultivated for the making of her favourite attar. It was at Ajmer that the English ambassador Sir Thomas Roe presented his credentials to Emperor Jehangir. Roe was granted trading concessions that allowed the British to usurp power and establish themselves as a colony in India, and in the early-19th century, Ajmer came under the domain of the British Empire. Like the Mughals, the British used it as a centre for exercising control over the kingdoms of the region, but they also provided it with educational institutions\u2014including the Mayo College, initially set up for boys from India's princely families. It's with such glorious glimpses of its past, and with the promise of answered prayers, that Ajmer beckons us to drop by. Things To see and do Ajmer's closest association is with the Dargah Sharif of Khwaja Sahib, the final resting place of the Sufi Saint Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti, whose disciples included the Mughal emperors. The town is teeming with other interesting sights as well. Two days are adequate, and an active one day feasible for seeing all this. The centre of faith The Ajmer Dargah is a complex bewilderingly full of many structures. The entrance gates, looming 70ft over the congested bazaar, were built by the Nizam of Hyderabad in 1915. The drums kept atop the gateway were gifted by Akbar after his successful campaign in Bengal. To the right, steps lead to the red sandstone Akbari Masjid (1571).

Straight ahead lies the compound in which various buildings stand around the tomb. The first is the Sandali Masjid, built by Aurangzeb, and it's here that sandalwood for the tomb is prepared. The path to the right leads to the tomb of the Khwaja's daughter, Bibi Hafiza Jamal; also located here are the tomb of Nizam Sikka, a water-carrier who had saved Humayun's life and Jannati Darwaza made of silver, but rarely opened. Overlooking these is Emperor Shah Jahan's Jami Masjid (1638), a gracious play of white marble. On the left of Sandali Masjid is the tiny Auliya Masjid, marking the spot where the Khwaja first stayed after arriving in Ajmer. From here, a path leads to the dargah chamber. From the outside, the marble tomb is a soothing structure, with silver doors and a golden finial. The vast courtyards on both its sides are often full of qawwali gatherings. The facet on the left is called the Begumi Dalaan, built in 1643 by Shah Jahan's daughter Jahanara. Its walls were gilded in 1888 and the ceiling later etched with gold. In the chamber, the man who said \"a faqir is one who is free of all needs\" lies under a silver canopy in a world of costly velvet and silks, attar and sandal, and gold and silver zari chadars.

According to the Padma Purana, Lord Brahma was searching for a place to perform a yagna when the lotus he was holding fell from his hand and landed in the spot where Pushkar now stands. He decided to perform the yagna there and then. As his wife Savitri was unable to reach the venue for the yagna in time for the auspicious hour Lord Brahma decided to quickly marry a local lady (Gayatri) and completed the formalities. When Savitri arrived, and discovered what had happened, she was so angry with Brahma she told him that from henceforth Pushkar would be the only place where he'd be worshipped. The floating chattri in the centre of the lake, you see today, was built in the year 1791 by the Thakur of Khimsar to commemorate the spot where Brahma performed the yagna.

The present structure dates to the 14th century. The inner hall of the temple is dedicated to Brahma and his second wife, Gayatri. Constructed with pristine marble and embellished with silver coins, it features a red spire and the image of a swan (considered sacred to Lord Brahma). The inner sanctum houses a chaturmukhi (four-faced) idol of Lord Brahma. Standing guard at the temple entrance is a marble statue of Surya, the sun god. The Rangji Temple is dedicated to an avatar of Lord Vishnu. Though architecturally it's a fusion of Rajput and Mughal architecture throughout its premises, its rearing gopuram (pyramidal tower) at the entrance has been borrowed from temples in southern India. Pind daan, performed to propitiate one's ancestors, is a time-worn ritual, even when the lake dries up and becomes a mere shadow of itself during a drought. This is the power of belief which pervades the aura of devotion and divinity here.

'Bhilwara', according to this contention, is a corruption/modification of that very term. The other story which also happens to be the more accepted one in these parts is that the Bhils were the first to have settled here, and that they gave the city its name. The temple established by the tribe, a phad depicting a weddingAJMER DIVISION 126 Rajasthan Rajasthan 127BHILWARA DISTRICT the Jataun ka Mandir, still exists in the old quarter of the city. It so happens that should you be taking a walk in this part of town, known as Junawas, you may chance upon its oldest residents. Bhilwara is also home to the Ramsnehi Sampraday. The founder Guru of the Sampraday, Swami Ramcharanji Maharaj, had a great following. He later shifted his base to nearby Shahpura. Bhilwara, long famed for the manufacturing of synthetics and cotton mix fabric and synthetic yarn, has emerged as India's largest manufacturer of fabrics. Also known as the Textile City of India, this bustling industrial hub encompasses 50 % of the total polyester fabrics and suitings manufactured in India. It is in Bhilwara district's towns and colourful streets that one will also find flourishing little bastions of the folk art of phad painting. This religious, scroll-based art form which originated several centuries ago in the village Pur, moved to Shahpura in the 16th century \u2014 and moved to the modern-day Bhilwara in the 19th century. Noted examples of this art are Devnarayan Ki Phad and Pabuji Ki Phad.

Mondays and Sundays are usually busy in the normal course of events. The temple's elaborately d\u00e9corated gate is a treat to the eyes, and the darshan of the deity can be had in a small cave filled with several shivlingas. Further up on the same hill is the Chamunda Mata Mandir, renowned as much among locals for its wish-granting reputation as the views of the city it affords from up top. About 13km out of Bhilwara town is Kyara Ke Balaji, where the image of Lord Hanuman etched on a rock is believed to have appeared there by divine intervention. Scattered around this site are other smaller temples such as Patola Mahadev Temple, Beeda ke Mahadev Temple. smriti van About 5km from the city lies a huge swathe of verdure called Smriti Van, which is an important green lung for this bustling city.

The town attracts many members of the Ram Sanehi sect, as it is an important pilgrimage hub for them. Shahpura is also closely linked to the fight for India's freedom from British rule through Kesari Singh, Jorawar Singh and Pratap Singh Barahat, freedom fighters who belonged to Shahpura. To the north of the town is a vast palace complex, which is worth a dekko, and so are Pivaniya Talab, Trimurti Smarak Ki Haveli.

From the very outset, Nagaur provides an immersive experience. There are no secrets to be found hidden here, and a tour of the city reveals much about the ways and lives of its inhabitants. The mandatory vegetable stalls, a Gandhi Chowk, poster commercials and village boys with the swagger of someone who owns a place\u2014the past and the present seems to coexist in perfect harmony in the city. Besides, what Nagaur offers ranges between the hot and the incendiary. The first is its famous red chillies and the second is the story of the man who's the reason why people visit Nagaur today. Things To see and do Nagaur's Hindu and Islamic lineage has given it architectural wealth that belies its sterile main street. Even then, it can be a challenge for those who travel by a clock and an itinerary. Big-time tourism hasn't thankfully reached here yet, so though the missing touts and guides will be a relief, chances are you'll also muddy your feet as you navigate congested lanes searching for littleknown places. It's ideal if you're looking for a bit of exotica minus the frills. Time a visit during the annual Nagaur Fair in January/February. Even if you do not find bullocks a tempting buy, the famous Mirchi Bazaar is bound to add spice to your trip. Autos are certainly a convenient mode of transport in Nagaur. amar singh's cenotaph Any mention of Nagaur is incomplete of Amar Singh Rathore, a 17th-century Rajput Rathore nobleman who would later serve the Mughals. As much respected for his valour, courage and battle prowess as he was feared for his mercurial temper, Amar Singh was given the governorship of Nagaur by Shah Jahan.

Today, the fort attracts thousands of visitors. Spread over 36 acres, Ahhichatragarh Fort was handed over to the Mehrangarh Museum Trust in 1985 and has been restored to its former glory, thanks to grants from the Getty Foundation. In 2002, the fort bagged the prestigious UNESCO Asia-Pacific Heritage Award for Cultural Heritage Conservation. It also made it to the final nomination for the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2011-2013. For a restoration project that's won a United Nations award and could prove to be Nagaur's turning point, it's surprisingly difficult to obtain clear directions to Nagaur's most imposing sight. It's built on a slightly hilly elevation, and once you get there, you'll park by the entrance to Hadi Rani's Palace, and enter the section of the Zenani Deodi into what was the women's wing. It becomes immediately apparent that though the battlements might have been defensive, the late Rathore had actually planned a pleasure palace for himself. There is a great delicacy to the buildings, and it is clear that it was a sybaritic rather than strategic retreat that the Rathores and Mughals sought here. Overlooking ghostly remains of gardens, waterbodies and fountains are buildings such as the Hawa Mahal, in which remnants of wall Not only did he flatly and angrily refuse to pay a fine for an unauthorised absence, he stabbed the collector and several others in a court presided over by Shah Jahan himself, before making a daring, heroic escape. Amar Singh went on to become a Rajput folk hero, remembered as their brave prince who stood up to the Mughals. Today, a handsome yellow sandstone cenotaph honours him, with his footsteps inscribed in the centre, next to which incense sticks are lit. There is a little floral carving on the pillars and ceiling, and surrounding it are cenotaphs in pink sandstone that honour his chief wife who died before he did, three other ranis, as well as later members of his clan. All are well preserved. Close to the entrance is a small Hanuman shrine where puja is regularly performed. A caretaker looks after this ASI protected monument though you have to wait for him to turn up. uLocation Near Collectorate ahhichatragarh Fort Nagaur was a stop on medieval trade routes, and hence the Rajputs and Mughals keenly contested control over it. After Amar Singh's demise, the fort passed back to the Mughals with whom it remained for a long period. Thereafter, it came under British vassalage, even though it was recognised as part of the Marwar inheritance. After Independence, the fort went into decline as the government neither looked after it nor protected it from bouts of vandalism. Following a petition from Maharaja Gaj Singh II, the current head of the Rathore clan, it was finally restored to him Nagaur Fort Nagaur Fort is a 35-acre complex with four main palaces and over 50 smaller buildings, surrounded by two fortification walls and\u2014despite the arid climate\u2014 extensive gardens, fountains, pools, and water systems. The palaces located in the fort complex showcase period furniture, antiquities and a fantastic range of frescoes illustrating the palace interiors. Decorative details can be seen on the interior and exteriors, ceilings and floors. Considered to be of the highest quality, the subjects include both figurative and decorative elements which provide a wealth of historical information on court life, manner of dress and the use of the various palaces. The murals at Nagaur are considered to be the finest in Marwar. Even the quality of materials used is of the highest order. This includes organic colours, gold leaf and the traditional highly polished lime plaster they have been painted on.

And so the fort houses the Akbari Mahal, a Mughal guest house built surrounding a water tank with a Sheesh Mahal where faint traces of mirrors and frescoes provide a glimpse of what must have been a sumptuous palace. Among the paintings of interest here is the one with ladies amid clouds and lightning bolts. The artworks in the Sheesh Mahal are among the most important examples of the fine, elongated figural style that is characteristic of Nagaur.

Monsoon is one of the times when maximum avian activity occurs in the park, a fact that often gets lost in all the attention that winter and the accompanying migratory birds receive. During the rains, some of India's most spectacular birds deck themselves out in their finest plumage, they get together to court their mates and nest in huge colonies in the trees which line the paths of the sanctuary. July marks the beginning of this season. Location is the primary thing when birds build houses\u2014no self-respecting open-bill allows another to trespass on its prime few square feet of treetop. Once the chicks are born, they grow at a fast pace and demand food in loud voices. The colony of storks then dons a busy look, with parents flying in and out so fast that even an Air Traffic Controller would have a heart attack. The cacophony of painted storks with their yellow bills and pink and white behinds has to be heard to be believed. They are a hungry lot too. Studies estimate that the 2,000 painted storks in the colonies require about 4 to 6 tonnes of food daily and, in the 30 to 40 days they breed, they consume around 1,200 tonnes! Hopping along the road as you stroll towards the Keoladeo Temple in the centre of the park you will see some of the permanent residents, easy to dismiss as little brown jobs, or LBJs as they are called by birdwatchers. These were, in fact, the creatures responsible for Salim Ali, India's greatest ever ornithologist, first taking an interest in birds. As a child, he shot with an airgun, what he assumed was a house sparrow. Then he noticed it had a yellow throat, he was fascinated, and began to investigate what it could be. However, these creatures are no When to go The park is open all year. August to October are the peak months for breeding and October to late February for wintering migrants. However, whatever time of the year you go, there will always be interesting birds to see.

They are now chestnut-shouldered petronias. When Keoladeo Ghana was made a World Heritage Site, its guests in the cold season included the Siberian cranes, with bills and faces as red as if dipped in blood, white plumage that was simply peerless and outstretched wingtips pitch black like a dark night. Sadly, the world proved too unfriendly a place for the flock that came to Bharatpur, which were driven away by consecutive years of drought. What's comforting is that although vegetarian Siberian cranes have dwindled, there is still the chance of seeing delicate demoiselle cranes, common cranes, or our very own resident crane, the sarus. aBouT Keoladeo ghana np Keoladeo is actually a name of Lord Shiva and is the form in which he is worshipped at the small temple in the heart of the park. Ghana refers to the thick tree cover the area once had. This sanctuary is known by the name of the adjoining town of Bharatpur, which is also the name of the king who created the park in the late 19th century. He recognised the potential of this area of scrub woodland that formed a slight depression, a hollow where water could be collected to attract water birds until it dried up. By diverting water from an irrigation canal, building small dams and constructing a system of dykes and shooting butts, he succeeded in converting it into one of the richest wetland habitats in the world. He entertained all the big guns of his time, including viceroys and princes. Their bags are recorded on a sandstone inscription near the Keoladeo Temple. In 1956, the hunting preserve was declared a sanctuary. The shallow, freshwater lakes, which make up about a third of the park's 29 sq km, form just one part of this amazingly biodiverse area of the Gangetic Plain, where some 350 species of birds find refuge and some 120 species nest. Keoladeo Ghana also boasts an amazing variety of flora with 181 genera. Things To see and do Birdwatching One route is to head to Sapan Mori, and then to turn right towards the Keoladeo Temple. If you head left, then you will reach the sunning ground of pythons. The Mansarovar and Hansarovar marshes and the swamps and lakes of Bharatpur form one of the most important heronries in the world. Winter in the park is one of the best times to see the various birds of prey together and compare their size and plumage. The largest and most impressive is the imperial eagle, while the smaller marsh harrier has an entertaining habit of gliding low over assembled ducks and putting them to flight. If you're very quiet, and go with one of the trained guides, you might just be able to see the large owls before they see you. The most visible and distinct ones are the magnificent dusky horned variety. The scale of the journeys migratory birds undertake is breathtaking.

With the launch of Project Tiger in 1973, the National Park began to be protected in earnest, and as the forest returned to health, aquifers in the area began to replenish.

No tempestuous rises and tragic falls here. No famous men either. Medieval Karauli, history's side-show, was ruled by kings who believed they were descendants of Lord Krishna. Karauli's story began in the 14th century, when one Arjun Pal founded the town. It was never a glorious empire, but at one point had considerable real estate. At its peak, the state of Karauli held the present district of Karauli, as well as parts of Alwar, Bharatpur, Dholpur and Gwalior. During the reign of Akbar, it was incorporated into the Mughal Empire. Later, it was subjugated by the Marathas and, in 1817, taken under British protection. Then something interesting happened in 1838. Karauli's king, Harbaksha Pal, died without any progeny. A relative, Pratap Pal, was raised to the throne. At this juncture, the dead king's queen suddenly declared that she was pregnant and, a few days later, circulated reports that she had given birth to a prince and the legitimate heir to the throne. The British promptly appointed a commission to enquire into the legitimacy of this child. It's not clear how the Englishmen went about it, but the commission reported that the queen's rumours were absolutely false. She was so ashamed that she left Karauli and settled in Bharatpur nearby. In the annals of Karauli, such machinations were par for the course, though. If there is one thing the erstwhile princely state of Karauli might have been famous for, it is the inability of its incumbent kings to sire descendants. In the 19th century, at least seven consecutive rajas succeeded by adoption. Karauli won over the British rulers in India during the events of 1857. For the support he gave the Englishmen during the insurgency, King Madan Pal got the salute of honour for the Raja of Karauli raised from 15 to 17 guns.

But, much like many small North Indian towns, the increasing neglect of Karauli's poorer areas points to contemporary, unsavoury realities. Yet, even now, Karauli remains an unpolished gem in Rajasthan's map that a tourist will always be delighted to discover. Things To see and do Karauli's main attraction, the City Palace, is reached via a narrow, sloping road through an extremely crowded bazaar. Though parts of the palace have been ransacked by local villagers, it is still very beautiful. city palace Start off with the City Palace, which you'll enter from the Ganesh Gate. Arjun Pal built the palace, along with the town, in the 14th century. However, little or nothing of the original can now be seen. What you do see is the structure erected by Raja Gopal Singh in the 18th century. He chose to adopt the Delhi style of architecture \u2014 the abundance of red sandstone in Karauli, similar to that used in Delhi, made this rendering easy. The more embellished additions came in the 19th century. White and off-white stones have been used very becomingly, painted upon with bright blues, reds, browns and oranges. From the terrace atop the palace, you can see the town laid out by the River Bhadrawati below, and the ravines and hills beyond. The labyrinthine pathways through the palace and the many stairways, climbing up and down, should afford you a happy half-day. The Diwan-i-Aam, the hall where the king met his subjects, has exquisite floral patterns in bright colours on the walls and ceiling as well as painted wooden doors. The upper floor has jaali work on the walls, from behind which the ranis could observe the goings-on below. The coloured glass jharokhas of the Rang Mahal, with their one-way visibility, made for beautiful purdahs. The mirror theme continues from the hall to the walls and ceilings of the bedrooms. Barahdwari, the women's dance hall, is lined with moustachioed portraits of the kings of yore.

Fierce winds effortlessly and persistently bend trees. A land more hostile is difficult to imagine and yet, five centuries ago, a band of warriors rode into this desert with the hope of laying the foundations of a kingdom that would bring prosperity to the region. Most of what was built by those warriors, the Rathores, scions of the royal house of Jodhpur, still stands, a testimony as much to the quality of the construction as to the arid conditions that retard decay. They speak of the colourful legends that blend into their walls, narrating among others, the tale of a certain Rao Jodha of Jodhpur, who once reprimanded his brother and his son Bika for whispering in court, asking in jest whether the two were plotting to build their own kingdom. They took the remark to heart and set out on their own. For 30 years, Bika led a band of marauding freebooters all over Rajasthan till he finally settled down here. Sadly Bikaner has been largely ignored by the average traveller, despite its splendid havelis and palaces. It could be one of your finest finds if you like your destination less trodden. Things To see and do On the face of it, Bikaner is a town known less for its architectural splendours\u2014though these are truly marvellous\u2014than for its savouries. Bikaneri bhujia may have become an exportable commodity today; but once Bikaner's greatest export was its international diplomacy, raised to a fine art in the course of the sandgrouse shoots arranged by Maharaja Ganga Singh, remembered as the founder of modern Bikaner. From fort to fort Bikaner's history is inextricably linked with that of its ruling family and their seat of power, the Junagarh Fort. This red sandstone fort lies at the centre of Bikaner. Raja Rai Singh commenced the building of Junagarh a full century after Bikaner had been founded at Rati Ghati (now on the outskirts of the city) by Rao Bika. The original fort at Rati Ghati soon outlived its purpose, and only When to go Definitely avoid in summer. October to March is excellent Tourist offices l Tourist Reception Centre Hotel Dholamaru Civil Lines, Near Major Puran Singh Circle, 176 Rajasthan Rajasthan 177BIKANER DISTRICT fragments of its original walls survive. In 1589, Rai Singh ordered the more spacious and strategically superior fortification of Junagarh, which was completed in five years. Enter through its stone elephant-flanked gates, go past the hand-prints of queens, and you come to the impressive ceremonial courtyard, where you get the first glimpse of the architectural treasures of Junagarh. Surrounded by a moat for defence, with public and private buildings added by succeeding maharajas, the whole effect is that of a series of buildings that seemingly blend on the outside but are vastly different within. The oldest parts are constructed in yellow sandstone while the rest are mostly in the striking red sandstone. uEntry fee Indian `50, foreigner `300, Video `150 Audio guide Indian `200, foreigner `350 Timings 10am-4.30pm, open all days (fees and timings applicable for museum as well) The most opulent of the palaces within the fort is Anup Mahal, which includes the Raj Tilak Mahal (or Coronation Hall) with embossed lacquer-work of striking lavishness. Badal Mahal, painted with large blue clouds (perhaps aspirational in this desert state), gives pride of place to a large portrait of Maharaja Sardar Singh, painted by a visiting Italian artist. The courtyards house the family temple of Joramal, as well as Har Mandir, where weddings took place. The Karan Mahal courtyard leads to Dungar Niwas, with its fine inlays which will remind you of pietra dura. The Chandra Mahal is beautifully painted and was built by Gaj Singh, along with Phul Mahal, which boasts the small bed of Rao Bika. Maharaja Ganga Singh, the last of the royals to inhabit Junagarh, gifted it a pair of grand sandstone staircases as well as its stately Durbar Hall, which has a floor as well as ceiling made entirely of wood. The hall is now a museum filled with an eclectic collection of family and clan memorabilia. The entrance courtyard of the fort now also houses Prachina, a storehouse of vintage textiles and costumes, as well as a souvenir shop. uPrachina Entry fee Indian `30, foreigner `100 Timings 9am-6pm Bikaner new and old The greatest symbol of Bikaner's aspiration to be one of the world's modern kingdoms was the building of Lallgarh Palace (named after Maharaja Lall Singh, who insisted on the two lls). On the one hand, it served to advertise Ganga Singh's endeavour to make Bikaner more robust economically (to which end he developed the state railways so as to exploit local coal deposits and commissioned the Ganga Canal waterworks to overcome drought). Its architectural plan was drafted by Sir Swinton Jacob, the foremost architect of the early 20th century. A huge but compact palace, Lallgarh is built\u2014appropriately\u2014 entirely of red sandstone. Said to be the best exemplar of a Rajput palace, its fa\u00e7ade is composed of the pierced stone screens called jaalis.

For the visitor driven less by faith and more by curiosity, visits are recommended to the temples of Ratan Bihari and Rasik Shiromani, located within Ratan Bihari Park, in the heart of town. Also noteworthy is the 16th-century Bhandeshwar Jain Temple (in the old town), particularly its mirrors and gold-leafed paintings. The Laxminath Temple next door is also worth seeing and exploring.

But, nothing intrigues the discerning traveller like the little town of Hanumangarh which captures one's fancy with its archaeological surprises. Once a part of the Indus Valley Civilization, Hanumangarh holds immense historical significance and the adventurer in you will have much to ponder over.

Hanumangarh is also a haven for those on a spiritual quest. Its age-old temples are much revered by devotees not only from Rajasthan but also from its neighbouring states. The town once served as the kingdom of the Bhatti kings and was originally called Bhatner. Its namesake fort still stands proud as a reminder of Hanumangarh's glorious past. Raja Suraj Singh of Bikaner rechristened it to Hanumangarh after he conquered the city. But why Hanumangarh, one may ask? Well, history suggests that it was a Tuesday when Raja Suraj Singh captured the city and Tuesdays are dedicated to the worship of Lord Hanuman, according to Hindu mythology and belief. Thanks to its location on the highway connecting Delhi with Multan, Hanumangarh has been an important centre of trade. In its heyday, the city attracted traders from Central Asia, Sindh and Kabul who used it as a stopover on their way to Delhi and Agra. Hanumangarh is also known for being the land of one of Rajasthan's most revered folk deities, Shri Gogaji, and draws devotees in droves throughout the year. It is also an important agricultural market town. Hanumangarh is also well-known for its cotton and wool weaving. Things To see and do Bhatner Fort Any trip to Rajasthan is incomplete without visiting a fort, and Hanumangarh certainly doesn't disappoint in that respect. One of the city's top tourist attractions is the Bhatner Fort. Situated on the banks of the Ghaggar River it is ranked amongst India's oldest forts. Constructed around 1700 years ago, the fort finds mention in Mughal emperor Akbar's Ain-e-Akbari. Its construction is credited to Bhupat, the son of King Bhatti of Jaisalmer. The fort has withstood the ravages of time and survived attacks by the likes of Timur and Prithviraj Chauhan. Bikaner's Raja Surat Singh captured the fort in 1805. Also worth visiting in the fort complex are temples dedicated to Lord Shiva and Lord Hanuman among others. T emple of shri gogaji You can't make the mistake of visiting Hanumangarh and not paying obeisance at the shrine of Gogaji, located 120km from the city in Gogamedi village in Nohar tehsil. According to local folklore, Gogaji was a warrior, who is believed to have had spiritual powers. He is also called the God of Snakes; Maharaja Ganga Singh of Bikaner built a temple in his honour around 900 years ago. Standing on an elevated mount, the temple is a fine specimen of a blend of Hindu and Islamic styles of architecture. It is embellished with impressive engravings. The inner sanctum houses an attractive statue of the deity, sitting on a horseback with a snake around his neck and a lance in his hand. Gogaji is equally revered by those of the Hindu and Muslim faith. The best time to visit is in August, when a fair is held to honour the folk deity. Devotees throng the place in droves to pay homage to the saint during the three-day-long fair. It is a popular belief that Gogaji can cure diseases and fulfil the wishes of his true devotees. sir chhotu ram Memorial Museum, sangaria The Sir Chhotu Ram Memorial Museum or Gramothan School When to go October to Feb Tourist Offices l Department of Tourism Tourist Reception Centre Hotel Dholamaru Civil Lines, Near Major Puran Singh Circle BikanerTel 0151-2226701 sTD code sancturay, past Parmgeet sharma 186 Rajasthan Campus Museum in Sangaria, Hanumangarh, makes for an intriguing visit.

Things To see and do anupgarh Fort The abandoned citadel of Anupgarh, formerly Chugher, has found an interesting way to emulate the mushroom rocks of romantic desert landscapes. But even as the bricks at the bottom of its hulking exterior peel off at a rapid pace, the structure has managed to draw history and architecture aficionados from all over. Anupgarh Fort is located 120km away from the city proper, quite close to the Indo-Pak border. The fortress, built in 1689 by a Mughal governor to keep the rebellious Bhattis away, and the eponymous town where it is situated, are witness to a checkered history of military and struggles for power between regional clans and Mughal forces. laila Majnu Mazaar Hardly a twenty-minute drive away from Anupgarh is the supposed grave of the fabled star-crossed lovers Laila and Majnu, in a nondescript village called Binjaur. Legend has it that the legendary lovers who now lie buried here belonged to Sindh, and eloped to these parts having escaped the clutches of Laila's family. The mazaar is wildly popular not just among local couples but also honeymooners from Rajasthan and Punjab, who come here to pray for their desired partners. If you're visiting in June, don't miss the grand 5-day fair that takes place here, during which the residents of the village make eating and lodging arrangements for visitors. Many may contend that this memorial was built only in the memory of the venerated pair and not on the actual site of their death. However, if you drive due east for a little under an hour on the 27A Road, you could actually come upon a site that has unearthed relics, skeletal remains and structures from the Indus Valley Civilisation at a village named Bror. gurudwara Budhha johad sahib Legend has it Massa Ranghar, the chaudhary of Mandiala in Punjab, was put in charge of the Harmandir Sahib, the chief house of worship of the Sikhs.

So don't be surprised when you find yourself exulting anew in the rediscovery of Jodhpur's architecture, colours and its history on your next visit. Rao Jodha of the Kannauj family founded the house of Jodhpur in Marwar, the Land of 'Maroo' or desert, thus named because of the region's extremely hostile living conditions. Their first capital was at Mandore, an honour which went to Jodhpur after the Mehrangarh Fort was constructed towards the end of the 15th century. The fort was built with defence in mind, and the slopes and the sudden twists and turns in the structure were meant to hinder the movement of enemy elephants. There was good reason for this too\u2014the state was often at war with the neighbouring Rajputs and Mughals. Nevertheless, the Rathore clan held on to its possessions and expanded over time. It eventually rose to become one of the strongest and biggest kingdoms of Rajasthan, along with Mewar and Amber. Things To see and do Jodhpur Town can be covered in two to three days in a leisurely manner. About three days should be kept aside for all excursions (see Around Jodhpur ). While heritage properties such as Rohet and Sardar Samand Palace don't offer too much by way of sightseeing, they are excellent stay options, provided their high tariffs are not a deterrent. A day could also be devoted to a visit to Osian where you can go on a camel safari or stay at a night camp. Keep aside a day for the Bishnoi village safari. umaid Bhawan palace The palace is a magnificent structure that's representative of the Indo-Saracenic style of architecture, and is made of sandstone that has been put together without the use of mortar. Umaid Singh, the then Maharaja of Jodhpur, ordered the construction of the palace in order to give relief and work to the people affected by the famine of the late 1920s. The project took 15 years to complete and gave employment to 3,000 artisans. In 1977, following the abolition of the privy purses, the current royal Maharaja Gaj Singh converted a part of the palace into a hotel. Today, the palace is divided into three sections: the royal apartments, the hotel that is now run by the Taj Group, and a museum. The royal wing is closed to tourists. The museum has a display of royal artefacts collected over the years, such as crystals, clocks, crockery and anything else that might have caught the royal fancy. The clock collection is perhaps the most interesting of all. u Location East of the town, adjacent to the cantonment Museum Entry fee Indian `30, foreigner `100 Camera Not allowed Timings 9am-5pm Mehrangarh Fort The most imposing structure in Jodhpur is also the biggest fort in Rajasthan. Built atop a 150-m high hill in 1459 by Rao Jodha, the fort has withstood many a battle, as is evident today from the marks of cannonballs on the fort walls. The entrance ticket has to be bought at the main entrance at Jai Pol, built by Maharaja Man Singh. The view from here, of the entire city, is simply breathtaking. To the south you can see the Umaid Bhawan Palace and closer to the fort, the Old City, famously painted blue to ward off Marwar's terrible heat. There is a museum here with an exquisite collection of artefacts, including some very fascinating war booty and even more fascinating armoury (some of the deadliest looking swords one might ever get to see).

Inside, in the delicately worked sandstone apartments, there is a wonderful collection of palanquins and elephant seats (howdahs), the outstanding one being a silver howdah gifted by Shahjahan. It is decorated with a relief of lions, whose faces look peculiarly like shocked Rajput warriors. Up one level is a room full of excellent miniature paintings in the Marwar style of the 18th and the 19th centuries. After this comes a series of apartments decorated with gilded wood, Murano glassware, Chinese tiles, murals, an opulent mix-and-match from different regions and historical periods that covers every available square inch of space. The royal splendour of the first family of Marwar is evident in the spread of costumes on display. The Zenana Mahal and the Phool Mahal have frescoes and stained glass. If you want to pick up souvenirs, the museum gift shop has designer items as well as stalls run by local craftspersons. When you're done with the museum, turn left and walk 500m past the Chamunda Mata Temple to catch wonderful views of the Old City. Return to the right of the museum to exit the fort via Loha Pol, where you can see handprints of Raja Man Singh's widows, who committed sati in 1843. On your way down you'll pass Rao Jodha Ka Phalsa, where folk musicians will greet you. This used to be the last point of the old fort in the times of Rao Jodha. Walk past Fateh Pol and turn right for Jai Pol to exit the fort. To get to the Old City go straight down from Fateh Pol.

Unfortunately, World War II was on, and a German U-Boat sank the ship on its way to India. But the maharaja wasn't one to give Jaswant Thada memorials 204 Rajasthan Rajasthan DISTRICT in. He tasked the Polish artist, Stefan Norblin, who was doing the paintings for his opulent residence, with furniture duties as well. The quintessential insistence on luxury and fine craftsmanship that one associates with Rajasthan's erstwhile maharajas is unmistakable, not just in the Art Deco style and sumptuous sprawl of the Umaid Bhawan, but also in its humbler cousin, the Sardar Government Museum. The museum's assemblage of European glassware and crockery, curious iron locks (one even shaped like a scorpion), ornate brassware, clay toys, Persian-style 'ganjifa' playing cards and leather accoutrements, are a convincing showcase of the life and times of the royal family.u Timings 9:45am-5:15pm; Monday closed shopping Jodhpur's bazaars are a riot of colour and tempting handicrafts, foodie pleasures and people-watching delights. Evocative vignettes play out as local men wander past with colourful turbans and handsome moustaches trailed by their women folk a-glitter with mirror work skirts and odhnis in the old city. The mystery that surrounds the colour blue in some of the old houses in the Old Quarter is somewhat unveiled through local lore. While there's one belief that they were painted blue to deter termites others have it that it was a sign to indicate the home of a high caste Brahmin! From spices to fabrics, from local cheese to silver jewellery, from leather goods to wooden furniture and artefacts, Jodhpur's bazaars are a tantalising treasure trove to explore. From the drool-worthy snacks and savouries, biryanis and sweetmeats, to be found in its khau gullies to the exotic dishes to be sampled in hotels and restaurants, eating out will never be the same again for you. where To sTaY Jodhpur offers plenty of options for accommodation if you are looking for a luxury holiday, especially in air Jodhpur Airport is connected to Delhi, Mumbai, Jaipur and Udaipur rail Jodhpur Jn is connected to Delhi (Sarai Rohilla Station) and other major cities in the state and the country road Travellers from Delhi should turn off NH48 on to NH25 at Beawar.

Brightly painted houses, cobbled streets, men in colourful turbans proudly giving a twirl to their thick moustaches, women's mirror-embroidered skirts catching the glint of the sun, life inside the fort goes on as it has for centuries, the changes in lifestyle mostly functional. This is said to be one of the few 'living forts' in the world and was one of the five Hill Forts of Rajasthan which were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2013. It's also a world that has managed to survive for long. The fort, whose walls chronicle the deeds of its Rawals and the riches of its traders, is one of Rajasthan's most celebrated living forts. Its havelis speak of the long trains of camels that trekked across deserts to reach Sindh and Afghanistan and West Asia, carrying silver, cloth and expensive goods. Its musicians sing the songs of its daily existence, of the beauty of their desires, and this music will echo in your ears for long.

Things To see and do The muted colours of the desertscape, the radiance of the traditional lives and the artistry embedded in stone are the highlights of Jaisalmer. Three days should be sufficient to see the place. Factor in more time if you want to go on a camel safari and camp out under the desert sky (see Around Jaisalmer on page 220).jaisalmer Fort From the outside, the fort looks small and toy-like, a fragile castle built on a miniature hill. Made of yellow sandstone, it turns golden as the sunlight falls on it. You have to pass through a series of gates as you follow the flagstone road. The first gate is located at Gopa Chowk. You enter the fort from the First Fort Gate at Gopa Chowk. Yellow stone towers all around, often becoming golden, and stone-paved passages wind through a series of massive and intricately positioned gates. All of it is teeming with life and history. The fort walls are a mute chronicle of the lives of the Rawals (rulers), of the wealthy merchants who went back and forth, of the camel trains which travelled across the deserts carrying silver, cloth and other expensive goods to Sindh, Afghanistan and parts of West Asia, of attacks by armies from Jodhpur and Delhi. You will find the grand tales still narrated by the road-side folk-singers, the music echoing in your ears for long. Rawal Jaisal, a ruler belonging to the Bhatti clan of Rajputs and who gave his name to the town, is said to have started constructing the fort in 1156 CE. Later rulers added to it. Throughout the fort's history, people have been living in the fort, and this adds to the sheer extraordinariness of the place. The last gate, called the Hawa Pol, opens into the main courtyard of the fort or the Dussehra Chowk, located below the Rajmahal. From here streets with touristy shops, hotels, restaurants, temples and people's homes lead to various parts of the fort. Enlivening these winding lanes are children coming back from school, women cleaning and washing, and milkmen with metal pots on their motorcycles. You can walk up to the ramparts and the numerous bastions, and absorb the stunning views of the town outside the fort and the rocky landscape beyond.

The temples are well-maintained and were revamped in the 1970s The Parsvanath Temple, dedicated to the 22nd Tirthankara, is the largest of the lot and the most impressive. The entry is through a magnificently carved 'torana' or gateway with an image of Parsvanath at the top. Inside the mandap, the ceiling contains a sculpture of a demon-like head with five bodies. The main idol of the temple is said to have been brought here from Lodhurva, the earlier capital of the Bhatti Rajputs of Jaisalmer (also see Around Jaisalmer on page 219). Nearby is the Chandraprabhu Temple dedicated to the eighth Tirthankara. The sanctum sanctorum has four images of Chandraprabhu, and outside it, are finely sculpted statues of other tirthankaras. There is an upper gallery with marble images of Parsvanath. The Rishabhadeva Temple is known for its beautiful sculptures, especially the numerous 'apsaras' or heavenly maidens on its pillars. The Sambhavanath Temple is a dimly lit chamber, and steps from the temple lead down to a basement called Gyan Bhandar\u2014a tiny, fascinating 16th-century library housing a number of ancient manuscripts, some of them dating to the 11th century.

The tank was built in the 14th century by Rawal Gadsi Singh with the idea of collecting precious rainwater (remember this is the heart of the Indian desert). Now the Indira Gandhi Canal supplies water to the tank and it is, therefore, never dry. There are many pavilions and shrines on the tank's banks, and a domed pavilion to its centre.

These havelis were built in the 18th and the 19th centuries when trade was most lucrative, before the rise of sea trade and the Bombay (now Mumbai) harbour made land routes redundant. The havelis are made of yellow Jaisalmer sandstone and are adorned with elaborate fa\u00e7ades, including 'jaali' (latticed screens) and carved balconies. The most skilful stonework is done on the outside, reminding you that the havelis are a show of wealth more than anything else. In some of the havelis, the top portions are later additions and this is quite clearly discernible in the quality of stonework. One of the heartening developments is that many new buildings are using traditional sandstone and employing local stone carvers. The new buildings in the city don't quite match the elegance of the heritage buildings, but they bolster Jaisalmer's unique look and feel. patwon-ki-haveli The biggest and the most ornate of the havelis is the Patwon-ki-Haveli, a set of five houses adjacent to each other, built by five Jain brothers in the first half of the 19th century. The most impressive work is on the out-side, and the work is so intricate that the more time you spend studying it, the more it reveals itself to you. The multi-storeyed buildings are con-structed in the traditional style - rooms set around a central courtyard. There are remnants of exquisite paint-ings on some of the walls; many walls have lovely 'jharokhas' (projecting stone windows) opening out to the courtyard or the street below. From the terrace, there are great views of the fort.

They are found on the ground on open plains and fields. The term bustard simply means slow bird, and in reality, bustards are slow as a consequence of their heavy build. Although they are strong fliers, they usually do not leave the ground. The Great Indian Bustard, or Ardeotis nigriceps, has a long, thick pale grey neck and long, yellow legs. Males grow up to 120cm and females 92cm. The two sexes are similar in appearance, although males have a larger black crown, long hind crown feathers and a black band across the breast. Earlier, bustards were widespread and common across the Indian subcontinent, but today, this species has all but disappeared from Pakistan, and its population in India has reduced considerably. Now classified as endangered, the Great Indian Bustard has become extinct in almost 90 per cent of its former range, principally as a result of loss of habitat and poaching.

The painting is also an evocative reflection of the grand lifestyle and leisure activities of the rulers of Ghanerao, amongst them horses and riding, something that resonated rather well with its English audience. In fact, horse riding is one of the most popular holiday activities on offer at Ghanerao even today. The leader of this band of men, Raja Viram Dev, belonged to a long line of thakurs of the Mertia clan, descended from the Rathores of Marwar. At the beginning of the 16th century, Ghanerao was established as a thikana comprising 37 villages, and helped maintain the balance of power between the neighbouring kingdoms of Marwar and Mewar, owing to its unique strategic location. James Tod, speaking of Ghanerao in his Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan notes: \"Ghanerao is the chief town of Godwar, with the exception of the commercial Pali, and the garrison-post Desuri. From this important district the Rana could command four thousand Rathors holding lands on the tenure of service, of which the Ghanerao chief, then one of the sixteen nobles of Mewar, was the head.\" Ghanerao is located halfway between Jodhpur and Udaipur, 19km north of Ranakpur. Entering from the south, the sign to know you have entered the town is the Government Primary Health Centre. Lush fields enclose the village, with the temples scattered all around. The Ghanerao Royal Castle, which has now been converted into a heritage property, is towards the south of town. About 7km from the Rawla, inside the precincts of the Kumbhalgarh Wildlife Sanctuary, and close to the Muchhala Mahaveer Temple stands the Jungle Lodge, which once served as the private hunting preserve of the Ghanerao rulers.

Your wanderings will also lead you to a complex of interesting chhatris. The rawla The town proper isn't particularly large, and asking around will lead one to a stately marble and red sandstone structure with its fa\u00e7ade painted in lemon yellow. The Royal Ghanerao Castle, which now operates for the most part as a heritage hotel, was built by the Mertia ruler Gopal Das Rathore in 1606 upon receiving his jagir (fiefdom) from its parent kingdom of Mewar (House of Udaipur). The tumbledown-yet-dainty features of the impressive mansion, with its jharokhas , domes and latticework, are reminiscent of the familiar Rajput style of architecture. The sun-drenched central courtyard is overgrown with bougainvillea and the inner walls have finally begun to reveal the scenes painted on them centuries ago, obscured by the blistering effect of limewashing. The grand structure recently underwent a restoration under the present-day erstwhile prince Shakti Ghanerao, who worked in close coordination with local craftsmen to reverse the ravages of time and neglect.The shikar ghar Nestled in the erstwhile hunting grounds of its owners, the Jungle Lodge entails a short drive up from the Rawla, through the narrow streets of the town.

But, to experience the inspiring setting, go for an overnight stay. Temple trail The gloriously sculptured and enchantingly situated main temple, called the Chaturmukha Adinath Temple, is a 15th-century ode to Rishabhadeva, or Adinath, the first of the Jain Tirthankaras.

Four huge luminous white-marble images of Adinath face the cardinal directions in the sanctum sanctorum. The pujaris (priests) of the temple will offer you guide services (pay as you wish). Do look for the column with the carved figures of Dharanashah, the chief financier of the temple, and that of Depa, the chief architect. Marvel at the translucence given to marble, at the poise of the dancing figures, and at the delicacy of the Kalpavalli (wish-fulfilling creeper) medallions. The other two temples are dedicated to the Jain Tirthankaras Parsvanath and Neminath. Although dwarfed by the main temple, they exhibit some exquisite carvings and pierced stone-work.

Minutes later, the patches on the mottled surface of the granite flanking the stairway appear to stir a little. A shape moves, more lifelike than the background, with its green eyes peering at you. It is a leopard, who has come to deliver Shiva's message\u2014He is happy. It's business as usual at the Perwa Shiva temple. Rajasthan 245The leopard has long been known to be a creature of the night, a solitary wanderer, a deadly killer. But in Pali's Jawai Bandh, where peaceful coexistence has come to define the relationship between the local Rabaris and the spotted big cat, it is a different story. The ethnic tribe, worshippers of Shiva, accord it godly status, and consider it the guardian of the temples, which are in dense concentration in Jawai. So, when the animal resurfaces at night to claim a calf or a goat, the natives consider it an appeasement to the leopard skin-wearing Destroyer- god. In return, human life lives on\u2014there hasn't been a single instance of a human killing in the past 150 years. Jawai isn't just about prehistoric outcrops sheltering spotted beasts in their crevices. The place is also teeming with avifauna\u2014at least 100 different species have been reported on the lake shores in winter\u2014and then, of course, there are the crocodiles. The Jawai Bandh which was completed in 1957 under Maharaja Umaid Singh of Jodhpur offers glorious views of the surrounding settlements. The 102,315-acre Jawai Bandh is fed by the river of the same name, a tributary of the River Luni. The territory is made up of a network of low hills and patches of farmland in between. About 15km to the southwest lies the pastoral region of Bera, a legitimate hotspot for leopard sightings. Perwa (9km), where the famous Shivgada Shiv Mandir is located, is to the northeast. The Sumerpur bus stand is about 8km to the northwest and the Jawai Bandh railway station, 4km to the north, can be approached via the Sumerpur Road. Things To see and do leopard spotting The Jawai hills, formed from cooled lava, are home to the highest concentration of leopards in the world, in their innumerable natural crevices that form a safe haven for the elusive animal.

The rest of the clans are said to have descended from the sun and the moon. The agnikuls were entrusted with the task of protecting the earth from demons.

The city's history goes back to 1241 when Kotah was under the Bhil tribals led by their chief Koteya. It was in 1624 that it achieved de facto independence from Bundi. The independent kingdom of Kota lay on a major trade route that regularly saw marching armies and camel trains. Being on the Mumbai-Delhi railway line furthered the city's growth.

In a previous birth, she had stood on one foot for 16 years, eating only dying leaves, in her love for him. But now they look as if their foreheads have never known nightmares. They lean towards each other in lazy serenity, Shiva and Parvati, seated on a Nandi, holding each other with more than just arms. Their eternal tranquility fills the sanctum sanctorum of the 7th-century remains of the Chandra Mouli Mahadev Temple, perched on the banks of the Chandrabhaga River in Jhalrapatan, the 'old town' near Jhalawar. The temple announces the once-presence of Chandravati, a city founded by the successors of king Vikramaditya. Understanding the region invoked by the word 'Jhalawar' means unpeeling layers of religious expression, political thicknesses and commercial undercurrents. When Rajasthan Tourism uses the word 'Jhalawar', they mean Jhalawar District which, along with Kota and Bundi, makes up the old cultural region of 'Hadoti'. There's the town of Jhalawar itself, the seat of the 160-year-old Jhalawar kingdom and its gorgeous palaces. Just 5km away, there's Jhalrapatan, teeming with old temples and havelis. At a distance of 15km, there's the Gagron Fort controlled by different dynasties over 1,300 years. And there are any number of ancient Hindu temples, Buddhist cave temples and viharas, and sculptures strewn around in forests... All this in an area called the 'Cherrapunji of Rajasthan' by locals, a green hillock-dotted terrain that bursts into huge ponds and lakes during the rains. Strictly speaking, there was no entity called Jhalawar in earlier times. This area of south Rajasthan was part of the history and fortunes of the Malwa Plateau from the time of the Mauryas and eventually became part of the Kota kingdom.

The riverside township overlaps the city of Chandravati, said to have been founded by Parmar Chandra Sen, Vikramaditya's grandson. Rajasthan's chronicler James Tod counted 108 temples here. Today, Patan is a walled settlement you enter through a formal doorway and are immediately gifted with the combined stillness of three banyan trees, a huge pond and quaint chhatris under which villagers rest in the afternoon. On the day of the local haat, nomadic men and women, iron-smiths by trade, bounce their red ghagras, silver jewellery and black moustaches off the bright yellow mounds of poha. held the forests in which kings are shown hunting in the famous Kota-Bundi miniatures. An able Kota minister, Zalim Singh, became Kota's de facto ruler and developed good relations with the British. The state of Jhalawar was created in 1838 out of parts of Kota kingdom because of a treaty between the British and Zalim Singh's descendants. It was called Jhalawar, thanks to their ancestors, who were the Jhalas, hailing from Kathiawar. Things To see and do The infrastructure of Jhalawar District still needs to keep pace with the richness of its offerings. The town is small enough to hardly take up a day of your time. Jhalrapatan can keep you occupied for a day, but to merely 'see the sights', half a day is sufficient as well. garh palace The original residence of the royal family, the Garh Palace is, as its name suggests, a grandeur-defining citadel-palace. Built by Maharaj Madan Singh during 1840-1845, it was later handed over to the government to house the Collectorate offices. Now the palace is under the possision of A&M Department. You can walk through and see the Sheesh Mahal rooms partitioned into cubicles, splendid frescoes with electric fittings, and the inlay work on walls and ceilings. A few locked rooms are repositories of every variety of artistic expression, from pietra dura to miniature styles to religious portrayal to portrait painting to English landscapes and floral studies to some rare glasswork. Within the Garh Palace enclosure stands the interesting Bhawani Natya Shala, an opera-house-style theatre made by Bhawani Singh, the king responsible for the creation of modern Jhalawar. Renovations are on at present, and are expected to be done with by 2022.This was once a vibrant centre for staging the works of Kalidasa and Shakespeare; the proscenium is built with an underground extension, such that horses and chariots could appear on stage!

The complex holds the remains of many 7th-14th century temples. In early mornings or at dusk, the quiet river, the shrines and temples, the richly carved pillars, and the profusion of heart- stopping art bathe themselves in a golden glow and match the serenity that can be found, in the best traditions of classical Indian art, on the faces of the icons. The Chandrabagha Fair is held every year at Jhalrapatan, in the Hindu month of Kartik (October-November). A big cattlefair coincides with the event with livestock being assembled here for sale from distant corners of Rajasthan. The 10th-century Sun Temple is dedicated to Padmanabh, whose image was enshrined here in the 19th century. With its lofty 97-foot high shikhara and its association with the sun, the Jhalrapatan residents call it the 'Konark of Rajasthan'.

It will make you wander aimlessly in the gullis and streets, or spend hours in the palaces learning about history and fate, war and misfortune. Udaipur's skies are full of water and so are its lakes. The walls are a smiling cream or a radiant white, and the caparisoned elephants and horses painted next to welcoming doors sport a splash of red and indigo. The abandoned ruins muster up an ochre melancholy, and the lively palaces are a shower of gold. The waters provide a silvery sheen. Udaipur is akin to a charming, seductive miniature painting of the Mewar School. Things To see and do A tourist's itinerary in Udaipur inevitably revolves around the sites of the erstwhile rulers: the palaces they lived in, the lakes they built, the gardens they frequented, and the cenotaphs built for them. All these places today dutifully echo a fictional history in which the Sisodia Rajput rulers of Mewar are famous for their virtues, victories and fierce independence. However, the splendours of Udaipur's architectural heritage belong mainly to its peaceful periods. Having done the regular tourist bit, the best thing to do in Udaipur is to discover the quiet in the maze of streets between Jagdish Temple and Suraj Pol. You will need at least three days in Udaipur. city palace complex The City Palace is where it all began in the 16th century when Udai Singh met a sage who advised him to establish a city here. Now the complex is a conglomeration of palaces built over 400 years. This largest palace complex in Rajasthan is a fascinating edifice. Twenty-two maharajas of Udaipur contributed to this structure and yet it maintains a graceful uniformity. Despite its huge size and the profusion of architectural elements\u2014jharokhas, columns and towers\u2014the elegant palace has an airy lightness about it. Perhaps that's because of its creamy hue.

And the 'Rawat', or the raja of Deogarh, who controlled as many as 210 villages, was one of sixteen feudal barons (umraos) who was entitled to wait on the Maharana of Udaipur, the capital of the kingdom of Mewar, legendary for its warrior kings like Rana Kumbha, Rana and Rana Pratap. Deogarh, formerly Devgarh, located in Rajsamand district, was the former estate of the Chundawat Rajputs (who hailed from the Mewar's House of Sisodia) and had 210 villages in their control. Gokul Garh Fort is one of the many defence forts that the Chundawats built to protect their jagir, at one time Rajasthan's fourth largest. To the west falls the Kali Ghati of the Aravali Range, while the Nathdwara Ghats are to the south and Ajmer in the north. The city's altitude allows Deogarh to be a popular destination all year round, even when much of Rajasthan is burning up under the untrammelled gaze of the summer sun. The expansive fort palace complex, temples, miniature paintings, jeep and train safaris, birding and wildlife spotting make for excellent weekend distractions. The other attraction of course is it's not as crowded, unlike Udaipur, Jodhpur even Bikaner. The area is noted for its granite polishing, a very old occupation on account of the region's mining activities because of the great reserves of costly stones, such as marble etc, serving the construction business.

The work of the artists was dominated by scenes from the private lives and court ceremonies of the ruling Rawats, with occasional sorties into territory such as the Krishna Leela for light relief. Inscriptions on the back of many of the Deogarh paintings have enabled the majority to be identified with one particular family of artists-Bagta who painted the miniature of Anop Singh (active in Deogarh around 1769-1820); his son, Chokha to whom the miniature of Gokuldas II is attributed (1770-1830) and Chokha's son, Baijnath (1800-1845).

There's much excitement in the jeep ahead as it quietly stops less than a 100 yards from a parapet skirting the jungle. A huge leopard is sprawled on it, happily soaking in the winter sun. But in a second, it leaps off and vanishes in the jungle as another jeep arrives noisily along aside. Much excitement all around on this chance encounter\u2014and that too before one has driven into the sanctuary proper. Moments in the wild are made of such memories\u2014 and are so worth it. Kumbhalgarh WLS will always be as much loved for these solitary sightings as for its enormous botanical wealth and tranquil vistas. aBouT K uMBhalgarh wls The Kumbhalgarh Wildlife Sanctuary will come as a surprise to those who see Rajasthan only as a desert state. These green tracts form the dividing line between the former states of Mewar and Marwar. Once the hunting preserve of royals, this area was declared a wildlife sanctuary in 1971. The diverse topography of the sanctuary adds to its charms. In its eastern part are ranges that loom over 3,478ft, as well as the source of the River Banas. The Marwar plains are to the north-west of the sanctuary. The rainwater on the western slopes flows as small rivers such as Sukdi, Mithdi, Sumer and Kot, all of which are the tributaries of River Luni that ultimately merges into the Arabian Sea. The sanctuary is known to be home to chausinghas (four-horned antelopes), leopards, panthers and sloth bears.

Wide enough for eight horsemen to ride abreast, it is said to be the second longest in the world after the Great Wall of China. The much-visited renovated fortress, rings with the sights and sounds of the annual Kumbhalgarh Festival. The Heritage Walk has become a popular event now. Visitors can enjoy the fort's history recounted in a sound-and- light show. About 2km from the sanctuary, the Kumbhalgarh Fort is considered the second most impressive fort in Mewar, after Chittorgarh. Built in 1448 by King Rana Kumbha of Mewar (after whom the fort gets his name), at a height of 3,600ft, it was also the birthplace of King Rana Pratap. The fortress was the base of Maharana Hameer, who went on to establish the rule of the Sisodia dynasty after the end of the rule of the Rawals in Mewar. The fortress is inextricably linked to Rana Kumbha since 1448 when he put the stamp of his fantastic military genius by shoring up this fortress into a second line of defense to his fortified capital\u2014Chittorgarh. u entry fee Indians `40, foreigners `600 Video camera for personal use (handheld) `25 sound & light show Adults: Indian `118, foreigners `236; Children `59 Show Timings 6.45 pmKumbhalgarh Fort One of the residents of the sanctuary UDAIPUR DIVISION krishan creativeRAJSAMAND DISTRICT 312 Rajasthan Rajasthan 313jeep drive from Kumbhalgarh WLS to Thandi Beri is the most popular jeep journey in the sanctuary.

You will see jeeps heavy with men and boys hanging out from their doors, loud autos tumbling across the town and markets full of chemists and mechanics. You go past these, and a small dam, and reach the newer palace of erstwhile Dungarpur kings \u2014 part of which is today a hotel \u2014 and settle in their lakeside, poolside open-air restaurant. Now you notice the surroundings again, and the town is not very far but appears distant. The tract is surrounded by low hills, and the name 'Dungarpur, the City of Hills' now makes sense. Later, with some difficulty, you will tear yourself away from the soothing waters of the Gaibsagar Lake and visit the old palace. Then the history of the not-so-well-known kingdom of Dungarpur will slowly emerge from the closed cupboards and the forgotten recesses, enchanting you with its colours and its stories. Things To see and do One of the reasons for coming to Dungarpur can well be that you want to do nothing. In that case, book yourself a room in the Udai Bilas Palace, grab a long chair near their pool all day long and just be. But if you are in Dungarpur to absorb all that it has to offer, it has a trick or two up its sleeve. The antiquity and the hidden treasures of the Old Palace, the birdwatching opportunities and the multi-cultural dimensions here take you by surprise. Dungarpur can keep you interested for two or even three days. Udai Bilas Palace is situated right on the south bank of the lake. On the west bank is the dam that created the lake, now the notional centre of the town. Across the road from the dam is the Srinathji Temple. The old palace, called Juna Mahal, is 4 km south-east of the Udai Bilas Palace, and is approached by a bumpy road. The old fort is located on a hill rising above the Juna Mahal.

Some claim, with justifiable reasons, that it is the oldest existing royal palace complex in India, perhaps in the world. The construction of the palace was started sometime in the 13th century and for about 650 years it was occupied by a single royal dynasty \u2014 the Guhilot Rajputs. At the same time, the palace was expanded, usually vertically. Now it is a wonderful edifice, nine storeys high, with two levels underground. The structure has suffered in the few decades of non-occupancy.The Juna Mahal enjoyed a strategic location on a 1,476-foot high hill overlooking the old township of Dungarpur; its towering chhatris and engraved balconies are eye-catching even from a distance. The palace is made of a beautiful bluish grey local stone called pareva stone and is an example of temple architecture being introduced into royal residences. The decorative elements include pillars, brackets and arches; the carvings depict warriors, dancers and musicians. The interiors of the palace are a veritable museum \u2014 its various chambers are tastefully decorated with ornamental mirror work, stone inlays and glass inlays. However, the most impressive are the paintings. There are depictions of gods, with Krishna and his playful stories being the favourite. There are court scenes and hunting expeditions. On the walls you will see Gangaur Festival being celebrated, the Bhils of Dungarpur being defeated in a battle by the Rajputs and a portrait of Queen Victoria.

November to February is the time for migratory birds and the monsoon months, from July to October, is the nesting season for local birds. Painted storks, pond herons, egrets and coots can be seen here. The woods are home to grey partridge, the paradise flycatcher and the golden-backed woodpecker.

A huge two-day fair is organised on the occasion of Hanuman Jayanti (usually in April). Beneshwar (70km) Beneshwar means the 'master of the delta', the local name that has been given to a shivling at the Mahadeo Temple in Dungarpur. Tribal communities in the neighbouring states of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh also hold Beneshwar sacred. Celebrated at the end of January or the first week of February in Dungarpur, the Beneshwar Fair sees a huge gathering of tribal communities. On the occasion of the fair, thousands of devotees gather at the confluence of Som and Mahi rivers, where the fair is held. They sing folk songs, sometimes around bonfires at night, and there are all the other ingredients of a village fair: dances, acrobatics and demonstration of magic.

The temple is perched over a hilltop and built around a naturally carved Shivling, now a part of the sanctum sanctorum. The weathered pillars still retain some of the old grandeur. Further up on the hill are a forest and an ancient monastery. Rishabdeo (41km) An important pilgrimage site just off NH48, Rishabdeo is a captivating place. The origins of the temple here are unknown but there is evidence of some repairs having been done in the 15th century. The temple is built of grey pareva stone with beautiful marble carvings. The multi-pillared hall has an extraordinary intensity about it. In the centre is a big idol of black marble. Interestingly, Jains, Hindus and Bhils worship the deity in their own ways. For Jains, the deity is Rishabdeo, also called Adinath, their first Tirthankara. For Hindus, the deity is Kesariyaji, a reincarnation of Vishnu.

For long it was thought of as a form of enamelling, but it is in fact a traditional art of fusing 23K gold with multi-coloured glass. The most common colours of glass used are red, blue and green. As thewa became a royal fetish, the themes used reflected the taste and concerns of royalty. The most exquisite examples of thewa work are housed in the Metropolitan Museum, New York.

Believed to have been the spot where Valmiki Ashram of the Ramayana was located, the WLS, which was recognised in 1979, is named after Sita, wife of Lord Rama. Of interest here for archaeology and art buffs are the Prehistoric rock carvings. Of the over hundred reported medicinal plants identified here, as many as 17 are among the 32 endangered species listed by the National Medicinal Plant Board of New Delhi. Trees, considered best for timber wood, too, are also found in abundance here, amongst them costly timbers such as teak, sandalwood, sheesham, kadamb, and sagwan. These lush environs, embroidered with many waterbodies, are a haven for 325 species of avifauna, including migratory guests such as the little cormorant and the white-browed fantail flycatcher. Wildlife sightings include those of leopard and flying squirrels. The ideal habitat for biodiversity existing here owes itself to the convergence of three different geological formations, resulting in a uniquely hilly terrain with altitude levels spanning 280 to 600 metres above sea level. The WLS is drained by the rivers Sitamata, Budho, Jakham, Tankiya and Karmoi. Sitamata WLS also comes under the ambit of the Rajasthan Forestry and Biodiversity Project, an Indo-Japanese collaboration that seeks to expand forested area, conserve biodiversity and support the forest communities of the state. The conservation work being done as part of the RFBP is helping cement the area's reputation as a hotspot for ecotourism in the state. The expansion of waterworks has also helped the numbers of endemic species such as the chausingha and the sambar grow considerably in the past two years. The adventurous traveller can enjoy great wildlife sightings.

This picturesquely sited little town, is easily accessible from that flamboyant city with its fairy-tale palaces and tranquil lakes\u2014Udaipur. Located between Udaipur and Chittorgarh, the area around Banswara has long been the home of the Bhil tribesmen. History reveals that Banswara was ruled by a Bhil ruler named Bansia (Wasna), who was defeated by Jagmal Singh who then went on to crown himself Banswara's first Maharaval. Two high points of Banswara's natural beauty were the abundance of its bamboo groves and the numerous water bodies. And though the bamboo has been sacrificed in the run for developing the town, you can still enjoy exploring the lakes and pretty islands set amidst its backwaters. Things To see and do Mahi dam Drained by the Mahi River, Banswara has capitalised on the damming of its waters, particularly when in the rainy season the sluice gates of the Mahi Dam are opened and the water comes roiling out in its hurry to sweep through the verdant landscape. Picnickers at the dam site make merry, revelling over this bounty. This is the biggest water reservoir in the Udaipur division. The hilltop Raj Mandir or City Palace offers spectacular views.

Mangarh dham For the local Bhil community, Govind Guru, a personage of high reverence, has been their saint who ensured the veneration of Mangarh Hill as the centre of his faith. He was inspirational in invoking the spirit of patriotism and 1,500 of his disciples (gurubhakts) sacrificed their lives while fighting against the British army.

Many of these come into their full glory during a good monsoon. Singpura Fall which drops from a height of 150 ft is also locally known as Wagad Ka Niagara. Jholla Falls in Naugama village, is around 30 km from Banswara city. What adds to its beauty is the lush verdure of its setting. Jua Falls is powered by an exuberant monsoon. Scores of revellers cut through the forested trails to enjoy the thunder and glory of this sparkling outburst of nature. Kadeliya Fall offers lots of fun to local picnickers who can enjoy the shallow pool created by the falls. But in the monsoon it is inadvisable to take a dip as the current becomes quite strong. Jagmeru Hill Station, located just The crystal water of Jholla Falls crashing through the rocks becomes a bower of verdant splendour in the monsoons. A steep road leads to the Hanuman temple which attracts many devotees. Samai Mata - Bhandariya (4km) Nestled in the verdant hills around Banswara, the Samai Mata Mandir is also a popular picnic spot for locals. The temple itself is accessed by about 400 steps. Chacha Kota Backwater (14km) The hinterland of the dam, some 14km away from Banswara, is studded with hundreds of richly forested little islands (originally small hillocks which got submerged in the dam waters) spread across the Chacha Kota backwater; the low hills are alive with the sound of dozens of small waterfalls streaking down the forested hillsides. Tripura Sundri, Village Umrai (20km)Located 5km ahead of Talwara, and famous for its many temples and stone-carving artisans of the Sompura community, this Shaktipeeth shrines invokes great reverence and is a major pilgrim hub. The Goddess, who features 18 hands and straddles a tiger made of black stone, is the tutelary deity of the region. The Shri Yantra resting at her feet is believed to be imbued with mystic powers. A massive Dandia performance is hosted every year during the October Navaratri festivities. Ghotia Amba (35km) Located in the hills near Banswara, it is believed to have been visited by Pandavas during their exile. Local legend has it that the mango (amba) trees were planted by them. In the Hindu month of Chaitra, a fair here attracts a large number of pilgrims from Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. Kela Pani, another sacred spot nearby, is also associated with the Pandavas. It is believed that Pandavas had served food in banana leaves to the rishis and sages. The shrine here is taken care of by the Devasthan Department of the government of Rajasthan. Arthuna Temple (55km) This complex of ancient temples, accessed by the Banswara - Dungarpur Road, is said to have been raised in the 11th and 13th centuries; today, it is an important archaeological site. Believed to be the ancient capital of the Parmar rulers, the site has yielded many temples that reveal the glorious past of the region's rich heritage.

Built by the Mauryas between the 5th and the 8th centuries, it fell in 734 to the Gehlot founder Bappa Rawal and was occupied for the next eight centuries by a succession of Rajputs and Gurjar-Partiharas, with intermittent Muslim assaults. Having housed 70,000 people in its heyday, the fort is today more a 500-foot high colony than a monument. As a testimony to its origins and its many rulers, it's littered with Hindu, Jain and Muslim construction, sometimes merged in one building. Chittor was the Sisodia capital of Mewar from the early-13th century until the Mughal Emperor Akbar's conquest of 1567, at which point Rana Udai Singh decamped to the hills. History, as warfare later comes to be glamorously known, having moved on, the beauty of this windswept swathe of eastern Mewar today lies in its quietude. Things To see and do Some people visit Chittorgarh as a day-trip from Udaipur, but this is not recommended as you then spend half the day on the road. It's best to base yourself in a resort in the countryside and then visit the fort, the villages, woodlands and temples nearby. From the city, you can drive up to the fort yourself or hire an auto in the main market. chittorgarh Fort Many battles were fought in and around this strategic bastion. The town faced three sieges. Today, the uphill road to the fort passes through various gateways, some with recognisably Gujarati elements. The tour begins with Rana Kumbha's Palace, one of the fort's most evocative sections and a model of Rajput architecture. Though Rana Kumbha didn't establish the complex, during his long rule (1433-68), he renovated and added to it considerably. Just inside the entrance, you can see where he used to sit and watch the sun rise and pray to Surya, to the tunes of musicians who were seated in the chhatri opposite. uEntry fee Indian `40, foreigner `600 Camera Free Videography `25 Memories of a queen Within the Zenana Mahal of the Kumbha Palace, the upper floors were knocked out by invaders\u2014the better to view the lovely ceiling chrisTine cipriani Chittorgarh is all about the romance of history.

Little of this atmospheric building remains, but the view of the city of Chittor, all periwinkle-blue houses with teal-green doors, is worth checking out. The Diwan-i-Aam (the Hall of Public Audience) is essentially a tree-dappled lawn, at the end of which stands the Rana Sangha's elephant chamber. The fort's Jain population comprised accountants and bankers who worked for the Ranas, and they left their mark architecturally. Across the road from Rana Kumbha's palace is a 15th century Jain temple, Shanti Nath, built by the Rana's accountant. It now represents an astonishing duality\u2014a neat square, elaborately carved on all sides, capped with a simple Islamic dome.

The queen is famed for her deep devotion to Lord Krishna after her marriage. Sadly she became a widow quite early. She recommenced singing and declined being in purdah. Life wasn't easy for her, especially because of the attempts of her brother-in-law to poison her. This is a memorial temple, not an actual place where Mirabai spent her time. Beyond the next patch of custard- apple trees is the tower you can see from afar, the Vijay Stambh. Built by Rana Kumbha to celebrate his 1437 routing of the Sultan of Malwa (Mandu), it rises nine storeys and is covered head to toe with Hindu deities. In a nod to secularism, Allah's name is inscribed in Arabic on the third and eighth storeys, but that didn't stop later Muslim invaders from taking shots at this amazing structure. South of the tower is the site of the second great saka, in 1534, this one is owed to Bahadur Shah of Gujarat. On the road to Padmini's Palace, you'll pass the Kalika Mata Temple, dedicated to Surya in the 8th century CE, but spruced up and rededicated in the 14th. Padmini's own portion of the palace, the Zenana Mahal, was built in the middle of a lotus pond, the better to keep her cool in the blistering summer. In 1567, when it was clear that Mewar would not join the Mughal army as Amber had done, Akbar attacked. This would be Chittor's third and final saka.

The most elaborate speciality is the kavadh, a sort of miniature altar painted with scenes from the epics and hinged so that it can be folded up like a book. Chittorgarh is also famous for its custard apples. You must not miss the chance of picking some for the rest of your trip. where To sTaY Being in proximity to Udaipur, Chittorgarh offers great lodging facilities.

The rooms are tiny, but with antique furniture and display niches and original jharokhas, you may not feel like going out anywhere at all!

Another school of thought believes they were commissioned during the Gurjara-Pratihara era during the 10th-11th centuries. The beauty of the temples lies in their exquisite stone carvings and great detailing. The eight temples in the complex are dedicated to Lord Shiva, Goddess Durga Lord Ganesha and the holy trinity. The temples are a fusion of Nagara and Pratihara styles of architecture. The complex is just 15km from Bhainsrorgarh fort.
