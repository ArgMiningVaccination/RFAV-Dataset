Heal with Homeopathy contains information about the human body and the diseases that affect it, with chapters organised from head to toe. The common causes of diseases, their symptoms and likely complications are listed along with homeopathic treatment and advice the reader can put to practice. Dr Batra describes at length a special aspect of homeopathy-personality types and telltale signs of tongues, faces and the like which form an important part of observation for homeopathic diagnosis. He also provides a brief history of homeopathy, clarifies some common myths and collates clinical research on homeopathic practices for most disorders. With this handbook he aims to spread the benefits of homeopathy-a safe and natural system of medicine-to as many people as possible. "}
