Remote. Sens in and .Public Health. The general. purpose of this research is to explore and present gays that a new technology---remote sensing----e^,n contribute to solut^.ons of urban public health problems in time of natural disaster. The objectives of this project are .to determine and describe remote-sensing standard operating procedures for publ^:c health assistance during disaster relief operations which will aid the agencies and organizations involved ^.n^ cl^.saster inter- vention. We plan to test the validity of this technology by applying it in apost-disaster situation {if .such-^. disaster occurs in our space and time frame) and comparing it,- where passible, to ex^.sting methods of gathering 3.n.formation. ' The important variaale here is time since existing; methods doi^ eventually accumulate necessary data. This research is anal- ogous to a therapeutic trial in that^we are tes ting one \"vaccine \"--remote sensing--against other \"vaccines \"---^ex^.st-- ^ ing approaches. 2. Disasters and Publa.c Health. Disasters interrupt systems necessary to maintain the public health. It is 3 necessax\u00b0y not on1.y to reestablish a^.l the interrupted systems_ ^ on which the protection of health of a community rel^es; .but, \u00b0 to manage the potential. and real public - health problem during t;ie .period ^of reestablishmen'^. -The activ3.ties involved ri doing this may seem .from. one perspective ^o have no relation to. health, but 'rpm:another perspecti^re they are the under-. - - f pinnngs.an which the health of a community depends. .Two ..-\u00ab-^._:._^_.._cvaeses:^EFJw ^.are broad-spectrum, that is, they are carried out on a societal as well as on an individual level, and (2) the emphasis in public health is on prevention, not cure. Medical. care-per se or effective treatment. o^f illness, it-has- been argued, \"has little, if any, effect, on the health of fact, .for .some diseases j successful treatment may even increase the burden of illness a in the community. From a community health perspectz.ve, med- ical care or treatment of illness \"represents the fa3:lures of community health\" (Stallones). j When- we consider prevention in rel.at^.on to natural.. d3.s- ^ asters we do not mean to imply prevent^.on of the event sincei with most types of natural. disaster this is nod yet possible. ^ - t This research emphasises a preventive approach to the effects of disasters and specifically to post--disaster problems that ^ .^ relate to public health concerns during the :emergency phase of retie#. Tt is^generally agreed .upon-that there are three3 phases of rel^.ef activities fallowing adisaster. - The first } is the e^iergency phase during which persons impacted by the i disaster. axe rescued and First aid and.other medical care aye administered. This phase is followed by the recovery pera.od during which time . residents of the .community assess fi their situation and work toward reestablishing a stable way of Life.. Public,health concerns. at this time ,may- revolve_ around treatment of illness which might, have occurred as either ^, a result. af. the disaster, a resu^.t of actions, taken during ,; ',..., _ --i ^^. _^^ !.. 4' the emergency phase,. or other factors such as the prevalence. of certain disease 'hypes pre disaster. The final phase deals with restorat^.on and rehabilita^;ion of the community to pre-disaster condit^.ons and may bake from weeks to years depending:on bhe type of disaster and economic resources available. to the community, - Concerns of .the emergency phase. may range-From reestab- lishing transportation routes into an area cub off by a . disaster to the identification of environmental factors which foster disease occurrence. Tn a disaster context, med^.cal care, while remedial,,may also come^under^the umbrella of public health coordination activities. Public health in the context of^disaster relief encompasses bhe total scope of community-health, name^.y, all the community efforts influenced by the med^,cal arts and sc^.ences, appl.^.ed to bhe prevention of disease, protection of life, and the promotion of the well being and e^'ficiency of man, ^.nclusive of-the physical, mental, and social. aspects.i 3. End Pr.oduct: Manual for .disaster mana ers. Originally, two manuals ar suggested operations g^^ides were planned--ane a technical guide for data gathering and analysis; and another describing potential applications of i the data gathered. The, First guide was to 'be directed.ta a ^ remote sensing spec^.alist. It was to oubl^:ne the tasks to- 1t J be performed by an image analyst including both preplanning i E and post-disaster activities. Plans far this guide werek s-1^ s 7 ^=^\u2014^\u2014 dropped. -- After reviewing the f^.rst annual report, our grs;nt monitors suggested (Appendix A) that the scope of the grant be limited to developing and testing a guide for disaster. managers;^ A guide. was then wra.tten for agency personnel out^:ini.ng ^y publie health problem 'the functions and tasks involved_ in disaster relief. evidence exists to-shQw that inappro- i priate actians ,on the part of disaster relief managers-have i a frequently contributed to unnecessary mortality,- morb^.dxty ^ ^ and inefficient use of resources (center far Disease Control, ^g'^4). Mismanagement problems are most often caused by a i lack of knowledge and /or sk^.11 of the work fu.nc'^ions required ^^ to manage disaster re^.ief. Our guide enumerates tasks which can be accomplished or aided. by remote sensing. This guide i.s i 1 { ' unique in two respects: (l) It documents functions and tasks, which are nowhere clearly outlined and^so imparts knowledge to Chase who cannot rely on experience as well as specifying in diagramatic form these same tasks far experienced person-^ ^ nel, and (^) It suggests a systematic and novel application of an improved technology for solving a serious problem. - B. HYPOTHESES ^ !^ - i We have formulated .the following. hypotheses: ^is 1. Remote sensing-technology can supply data faster,. mnrP of management errors in a disaster caused , by information delay. ; Testing the difference in qua.li^y of data collected at' comparable time intervals from current methods and from remote sensing wot,^ld ideally require that the two collection systems were used simultaneousl3^ and then compared. This could be done if an actual d^.saster were ^o occur in the .time frame of the current project. A second testing.praced^ire would be to make a retrospective study of-.the time required far collection and z.ts quality by intervietrring persons recently involved ^.n a disaster. 'This information could be oompared to the estimate derived from a simulation whereby remote sensing i.s.used to provide the-same data. Testing the second hypothesis is very dif^\"'icult'and'will 1 not be undertaken since ^.t is 'virtual7,y, impossible to conduct a controlled exposure validation. Th3.s would entail having the same disaster strike Ewa similar communities w^.th equal- intensity at the same time and exposing ane^to remote sensing while using the other asa control community w^.^hout the use of remote ,sensing. Additionally,-we have no mechanism whereby ^ decision-makers would be limited to utilize data from remotea .sensing sources. However, we will demonstra^e^ its usefu^.ne'ss - ^ ^ by the guide which presents the problems a.n flow chart-forma ^ } !..:. .. to encourage such utilization. C. SECQND YEAR STEPS.

Our primary concerns in writing the manual were that it be wr3.tten ^.n an understandable manner, that the guide be i kept general so as not to preclude individual adaptations, ,. and that the applications we described-were feasible and could- be implemented with a reasonable amount of planning. ^ Preplanning for natural disasters is .a subject which 3s much discussed and encouraged by E0C directors but which lacks imp^.smentatian in most communities.. This guide strongly emphasizes preplanning and includes charts and tables of recommended baseline data for the six public health prob^.em areas.

I l_ I Tiost city and state Standard operating Pracedvres (SDP's} for disaster _ management begin with the assumption that decisians:ab4u^ the: type and quantity of the resources rec^uixed to min^.mzze the disaster impact have been made. These SDP's generally list the responsabilitie.s of various ^ agencies at^d describe haw to implement tasks. ^.'ox example, as stated in. one F. ;^ city SDP, the Tlepaxtment of Publi.o Health has responsibility far prov^.ding ! tttedical Dare and treatment for the ill and in.,^ured. .This plat. assumes .that^:;: decisi:ans about whether or not medical attention i.s actually weeded; whether. . or not it can be handled locally, -and whathex o^ net facilities-are adequate, have been made. We tiave.n^t ^ourcd evidence to support the belief that thesei a deCiSiOTlS are made in a s yStematiG Way. in athe;, wErsa^r.s, dibc. St2s. plans ahere- they exist have been organized around decisiaxis that have not been made ex- plicit. Further, as mentioned, it appears -that infarmatian on which to base decisions of this type is not eas3?;r available. . SDP's usually detail tasks by agencies rather than by functions to be j - a accomplished. This approach appears to lead to fragmentation aud. duplication { of effort since restoring certain systems. fo^.lowing a disaster may crass-- cut several agencies' duties. For example, checking and restor^ng :the water t system and supplying water may involve the Division .of Hngineering Services which is xespansiblefur .checking and repaizing the system, the Health..^ - ^Department which is requixed to test for ^:ontamination, local. government and ` ox distributes water to areas where the supply has been cut.- ; off, and the bepartment of. Safety and Transportation for tnovemen^.^f water tanks. A tnore.whal.istic approach ^o disaster management is to diagram work_ : ^z^nctions without consideration u^ agency boundarx.es, ..and .this. - is the- ap-- :. - .pxoach of this- manual.

This data set would inc^:ude population, struc- tore, and land characteristics. Examples of such data are number of children, total population, and institutionalised persons; numbers of dwelling units, day-time occugied structures, emergency public shelters; lowest and highest elevations, floodplains, levees and other ridges or high ground. Networks such as water and sewer pipes, and streets and highways are not adaptable to tabular form and so maps of these systems, overlaid with grid squares, should be available to the disaster manager. A topical series of maps should also include hosFital and emergency room locations, shelters, schools, and water pumping stations. Local dis- aster managers may determine other crucial sites in their communities far placement on maps. Data 5aurces Varied information can be atquixed Pram predisaster aerial photography which has been interpreted. Planning commi.ssians are also a source of land use and transportation information. City departments may supply water and sewerage system maps although a complete set for a large city may never have been assimilated. Other sources are State Highway Tlepartment (planning division), Forestry Department, Corps of Engineers district office, t3.S.C.5.= ,^ il.S. Department of interior, NASA, or military organizations (such as Strategic and Tactical Air Command---SAC and TAC). The Census of Population is a valuable data source far Standard i Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMSA`s). The Census picavides information on age groups in communities with greater than ^50,OOQ population. ^^.i group data break age into three groups for SMSA^s: under age l$, 19-61, over age 62. This data would be available only by special survey in communities wit^i fewer than 60,000 population. A Sanborn map series is available for most large cities and gives detailed information an commer- vial structures for insurance purposes. Same urban places have been sur- veyed by the American Red Cross. Not all sources are available for every community and not all sources keep the information current. Tables of recommended baseline data follow short descriptions of each of the six management concerns. These are the optimum bits of information about each grid square which would prove helpful. to disaster managers._^ ^ ^ ^I 9 ML^BICAL SERVTC^S BASELTNL DATA The normal operation of medical services requires that the major structures such as hospitals be intact and ghat staff be available to carry out routine procedures. Treatment of injury and illness following a natural disaster can be done more effectively and efficiently if every^- day facilities are utilized and personnel, with a few exceptions (e. g., diversion of a few physicians to organize disaster activities such as triage), perform an augmentation. of their normal. everyday activities. Responsibility for treatment of in3ury and illness in the community belongs to the local medical society, and this remains true during and following a disaster. A means of transporting the injured to treatment centers and a system for distributing them to appropriate facilities must exist. Efficient dispersement of injured in a disaster depends on (l) a system of communi- cation sa that changes in the receiving capability of local hospitals can be monitored and (2) information about the services offered and the re- sources available to the hospitals. Three sets of data malce up the recommended baseline information relevant to med^.cal services. These consist of (1) ].and use, (2) papu- lotion and (3} topography. These data provide a means (1} to estimate the type and number of injuries, ( 2) to assess the adequacy of medical resources, and (3) t.c delineate routes for transporting the injured to hospitals for treatment. All data should, be recorded by grid square. Land use Land use information can be broken down into sevezal categories such as Residential, Community 1:aci13.ties, Zndustria^., Commercial, (}pen Space ,,10f i and [?then. The number o\u20ac residential units gives an indication of the popu- lation if the number of people has not been determined by anothez method. Important considerations may be age and quality a\u20ac structures. These should be detailed enough sa that injuries might be more accurate3.y esti- mated. Past experiences in the community or in similar communities will suggest the most important variables such as age, construction material, etc. to organize baseline data. Community facilities are usually located an small parcels and are scattered. These would best be shown on base maps. They axe resources which can be called upon in disaster situations. Each hospital site should be listed separately with in\u20acormQ.tion regarding its capacity to handle disaster victims and the services it offers. Industrial land uses should be identified and noted regarding any special situations in terms of hazardness, For example, chemicals may re- quire special fire -^\u20acighting equipment. Stro^.g wands tray topple towers ar injure storage tanks thereby creating a secondary hazard. An estimate of daytime and nighttime employment taould heap determine the population-at- risk of i^xjury in a sudden disaster. Commercial uses are important daytime activity centers and create a large population-at-risk. Each community may wish to adjust the land use categories to re\u20aclect its own needs. Office space may be negligible in ,some coimnunit3.es, for example. Population The total populat^.on per grid square represents the population--at- risk. Sub-populations may need special provisions. ethnic groups withdiffering beliefs aboat medical sexvices or food may be significant in number and should be noted in the baseline data. Other population classes such as age groups may be important, Illness and injury unrelated to the disaster as weld. as cases from the disaster and from crowded shelter conditions must be considered. Pre- disaster disease information would be valuable although this would change mare rapidly than other data. It would also tend to be more widespread than in discxete grid squares. If communicable health problems ware known, the results of sheltering persons could be anticipated and needed supplies could be arranged early. School principals may be a current source of this base data, School personnel also serve as shelter managers because schools are frequently designated as shelters by the disaster-responding agencies. Tap_ography A topographic map with elevations and important landforms would be useful in plannzng evacuations or movements to h3.ghr^r ground. Delineated floodplains -are necessary to determine affected populat^.on, impassable roads and isolated community facilities at designated flood levels.Grad Square ^6i ^` i i .^ ^_:_^TABLL^ 1 MEDICAL SERVICES DATA SHEET Land Ilse ^`^ Units Population Residen^:ial Single Multiple Mobi3.e homes Live-in Hotels/Motels Community facilities Schools (Enrollment & 5taff} k'^.re stations {Staff} Hospitals (Capac^,ty & Staff) Bed.

Components of the water system include wells, mains, water pumping stations, ground storage tanks, hydrants, and reservoirs. Responsibility for the maintenance and repair of the pumping and distribution system be- longs to the Water Division of the Public 4Torks or Services Department. Determination of the suitability of drinking water sources may be made by chemical and microbiological means, or, where other methods are unavailable, by visual inspection. Depending on the source of the water, different treatment methods and degrees of treatment are used. For example, water from deep artesian trells may be safe to drink as i.t comes from the Drell or may require ortly slight chlor^.nation. Water from other sources such as lakes tray require more complex methods of treatment. Water is routinely checked for contamination throughout the distribution system, at the water plants, and at each well. Collection of water samples for determination of microbiologic contamination is usually done by both the Water Division and the Health Department. Responsibility of decontaminating the water usually rests with the Health Department. Several kinds of information bits pertain to the water system. Wells, pumping stations, reservoirs, storage tanks, and hydrants are crucial points. It is practical to mag all but hydrants as baseline data. Perhaps certain hydrants which are part of the subsystem serving other crucial points (eg., hospitals) could be pinpointed for special attention. .. ^rYGrid Square ^^ TA.^3LL 4Te^.l stations SgLJRRAG^ BASEI,INT; DATA `The operatiort o\u00a3 is on the.avail- ability o\u00a3 electric power which 3.s n:ecessary to operate sewer pumps and treatment plants. riains are another component of the system, but since they are^\u00a3or the most part gravity f^.ow, electric power is not important to their operation. ,There mains are gxavity \u00a3law, treatment plants ere located at a low paint often near bayous and. rivers to facilitate dis- charge a\u00a3 waste.

The locations of treatment punts and sewer pumps are important sites to have pre-marked on maps. Theca are two major parts o\u00a3 the sewer- age system. Although sewer mains are vital to Functioning, they are under- ground and therefore invisible to the eye. Nevertheless, a map of this system may prove useful. 1 '`Grid Square ^^ TABLL^ 3 SLWERPG^ DATA SH^^T Crucial sites Collection plants Treatment plants Sewer puwps Light Stations .Sewer mainsSHELTER BASELINE DATA The residential units of an area provide shelter for a relatively permanent population. Zn addition to Chase living in dwelling units, others reside in nursing homes, dor^nitaries, prisons and other institu- Lions. Persons who are traveling or are between residences may be staying at hotels and motels. Other temporary quarters may be hospitals and jails. Few persans in this country lack shelter and are found living in the streets. When the normal living system is disrupted, temporary quarters need to be established as on a public service basis. Some persons may have the resources to obtain substitute shelter for themselti =es, but the majority w^.11 be helpless without organised relief efforts. The persons potentially in need of shelter include both the residen- tial and institutional populations. Those residing in specialty quarters would need special grovisions such as extra nurses, guards, or other equip- ment. Moving these persans to another similar facility might be better than relocating them to a shelter if transportation exists. Persons who have been dislodged from dwelling units, hotels and dormi- tories can be .relocated to nearby shelters. Estimates of the numbers that might require shelter should therefore be kept current for the grid square areas. If an entire grid area suffers daxna.ge or is inundated, the total population will need shelters. An area may be so badly damaged that esti- mates could not be made from the debris. In this case, only knowledge of the predisaster situation could give an accurate account of the problem. Cxitical information includes both the normal situation and the post- disaster situata.an. Zt is the difference between the number of pausing units standing gredisaster and the numbers standing after the disaster1S19 which most accurately assesses the damage. Without baseline information, pastdisaster data will be less reliable. Potential shelter sites are usually identified in advance in case emergency housing is needed. Schoa^.s and Churches are most often designated as shelters since each neighborhood contains at least one such facility at the time of a disaster. These sites need tv be noted on the standard maps so selection of appropriate a pes {e.g,, those undamaged and closest} can be made. Other sites, which could be designated as shelters if needed, should also appear on the maps. These may be structures servicing large daytime populations such as office buildings, libraries, college campus buildings, etc. 'Those best suited would have large spaces far sleeping ar- ^. rangements, multiple restroams and perhaps kitchen facilities. The capacities of shelters and the numbers of residential units forms part of the baseline data for shelters. The estimated daytime and nighttime populations completes the recommended baseline infoxmation {see Table 4 ). Shelters p^:esent additional community health problems due to crowding, disruption of procedures conducive to good personal hygiene, etc. Under these conditions communicable diseases can spread with great ease.Grid Square ^^zv TAE^L^ 4 SHELTER RATA SHEL^T Designated Shelters (mapped) Capac^.ty Supplementary Emergency Shelters (mapped} (other buildings capable a^ emergency us Capacity Res^.dential Single Mobile homes L^.ve-in institutions Hotels/motels,. _21 Fran ^AS^^.zl^ ^^^A Food handling establishments in a community anclude grocery stores and warehouses. Restaura#ts also maintain a stock of food on the premises. Food supplies are continually being shipped into c^.tates and with total disruption of this system the supply at any one time would last only a few days. Special subgroups of the population may need special, foods. Sources of baby food and other canned goods Yaould be valuable baseline information. Fresh fruit and vegetables will not be edible after a few ,days without refrigeration so these sources would be useful for only a short time.

A listing of each essential rote, bridge, airport and qthat critical points should h^ available. A map of major auto and rail arteries is the best form of recording their location. Airports, heliports, and water routes may also be of local importance. These may be located by symbol nr number on transportation map(s).

Community health, as discussed in Chapter ^., rests on the smooth function- ing of certain service systems. The systems which are necessary to maintain community health include: medical services, water, waste disposal, shelter, food, and transportation. These diagrams are linear, that is, various tastes are ordered sequen- Bally according to priorities. However, relief activities for the most part have a web-3.ike structure in which many things go on concurrently. Therefore it must be kept in tnirtd that the starting point for each of the diagrams ^.s either predisaster planning or immediately pastdisaster. zn addition, tasks an a single diagram not only may but should go on sitmtl- taneously. For example, repair of the water facilit^.es may go an concur- rently itith distribution of water. Major decisions that need 4o be made in each area are identified by a diamond symbol an the figures. Infor^tation needed to make these decisions is enclosed by rectangles. Alernative ways of acquiring soxtte of this information is circled, Each worts function is briefly described followed by the f1.ow diagram of that function. A summary sheet stating how remote sensing might aid these work functions is also included.IMRDICAL SERnICESz^ j` ^.._... ^The major decisions which need to be made to perform this function are: (1}a Is there a need far emergency medical attention? ,^ (2} Gan medical attention r be handled locally?, and (3} Are local facilities and supplies adequate? (Figure 2). The main information \"bits\" needed in order to provide medical care are an estimate of the number and type of injuries and illness, an assessment of the adequacy of available supplies and resources, and if necessary, a irnowledge of where supplementary facilities and supplies may be obtaaxled. There appears to be no systematized reporting or recording of injuries following natural disasters. The organization or group which runs the ambulance service is in the best position to know numbers and types oz injuries. In mas'c cities ambulance service is privately owned and operated, but in same cities, like Houston, Texas, it is run by a city agency such as the F9^^e Department. An unofficial estimate of illnesses and injuries is made by the Red Crass based on the number of cases occurring in the shelter population; but 3 .nitial estimates are not very , accurate. Responsib^.lxty for_ treatment of injury and il].xsess following natural disasters generally belongs to the local Medical Society and sometimes to the Department of Public Health. The responsibility of the Red^Cross iz^ the area of medical services is limited to treatment of emergency medical problems occurring in the shelters they staff. Physicians and other medical personnel in the private sector may or may not be organized to the extent of having prepared an SOP. For the most part their tasks in a disaster are the same as their everyday activities but^on an augmented basis:,^ i L more personnel may be required to be on duty to handle the increased number of injuries and illness. With or without an SOP, the effectiveness of this group depends an the sophistication of the communications network available to them. Persons in charge of triage in the field need to catmnunicate with the hospitals in the area in order to be informed of what resources are available at various institutions (e.g., some hospitals may be bettex equipped to treat burns than other hospitals) and to be informed of their capacities. Most hospitals have inventories of their supplies and information about their resources and capacities, but there is no central source for obtaining this information far all hospitals in a given geographic axea. 50P's might be a useful means of centralizing this information for inte- grating it into disaster plans. It is generally the responsibility of the Health Bepartment to ascertain resource availability infortation and to establish xesupply requirements. The SOP fax this agency could be ex- panded to include this additional information. The following table s^^,rizes the capability of ^emate sensing to provide information concerning the problem area of medical services. ^^ .^..^ I^ 2p ^ITCAL SERVTCES & REI^OT^ SENSING can, with baseline data, supply .the fallowing: (1)extent and nature of residential damage (Multiple, I^ab^.le homes) (2)extent and nature of commercial damage {^) extent and nature of industrial damage (4) extent and mature of medical facilities damage {5) 4xtent and nature of utilities damage (fi) extent and nature of open transport routes and present capacity.

(Figure 3). In time of disaster, ^.n- formation to perform these tasks is usually gathered by field survey. repair of the pumping and distribution system. involves checking the. major elements of the system which includes wells, Mains, water pumping stations, ground storage tanks, hydrants, and reservoirs. Water mains are, for the most part, underground and sa are not affected by hurricanes and floods. The exception to this is where mains cross bayous or rivers. Here, wind damage due to tornadoes might result. Where wells are in low areas, flooding might be a problem. Tn areas of severe flood^.ng, relief workers might not be able to get into an area to check or repair the system. The Water Division of the Public Works D^partfneat is usually the agency responsible for performing these tasks, and a preliminary cheek of the system following a natural d^.saster ta pes approximately one day. Tf the water distribution system is inoperative due to damage of the system or to contam^.nation, water must be furnished and distr^.buted. In order to do this, three information \"bits\" are required: (1) an estimate o\u00a3 the population in need of watex and the duration of this need, (2} a \" method of supplying water, and (3} a determivatian of the local zacili- ties and supplies. Water distribution is generally the responsibility of local government but is sometimes handled by the lied Cross.I 31 WADER & REMOTE SENSING With Vaseline data, a photo interpreter can identify' the fallowing: (1)wells (2)pumping stations {3) reservoirs (4} elevated storage tanks, and (5) hydrants. The nature and extent of damage to these is detectable. Without baseline data, reservoirs and elevated storage tanks wou.].d be recognizable unless damage had demolished them .beyond recognition.FI^UfiE ^, l; i i f1Three majox decisions need to be made for thus task: (1} Is the sewer system (treatment plants and collection system) working?, (2) Is there a need for supplementary facilities?, and (3) Are these facilities available easily? (Figure 4}. This information is usually gathered by field survey. Components of the sewer system which need to be checked postdisaster are the treatment plants, mains, and pumps. As with water, the operation of the treatment plants and sewer pumps depends foremost an the availability of electric power. Maims for the most part are gravity flow sa the treatment plants are usually located at a law point. Treatment plants are generally situated near bayous and rivers so that waste may be easily discharged. For these reasons, plants may be prone to flooding. Sewer mains may become blocked lay trash and flood water, and breakage may occur at tressle crossings where mains cross bayous ar rivers although this is rare since most mains are underground. Pumps may be damaged by wind if they are alcove ground, while those housed in vaults are mare vulnerable to flooding. . Tn disasters, problems associated with treatment plants and pumps are discovered first while those associated with mains are found last, often by citizens' reports. In Houston after Carle. it took about three weeks to I,^ca^te all 4^he problems with the sewer system. If it becomes itece^s2ry to supplement or temporarily replace the regular sewer system, three \"bits\" a^ information are needed: (l) an estimate of the population in need of alternate ^ :anitary methods, (2) the distribution of the population in ne^^'t, ^itd (3) a determinat^.on of the local facilities and supplies. These activities are generally haxadled by local government same^- times with the help of the Red Cross.34 One way of conceptualizing these tasks might be on a societal versus an ^.ndividual level. For example, the Sewer Division ^,s concerned with reestablishing the integrity of the system as a whale far permanent use while ether agencies such as the Red Cross are concerned with meeting the sanitary needs of individuals on a temporary basis. I.^^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^^ s^aE^ac^ & ^aT^ s^usx^tc With baseline data remote sensing information obtainable From low level aerial photography includes the following: {l) nature and extent of damage to collection and treatment plants (2} nature and extent of damage to sewer pumps if above ground {3) routes for bringing in equipment and alternate facilitues. Without baseline information aerial photography would be ?.united in its usefulness. Treatment plants are potentially identifiable. Routes for bringing in alternate facilities can be designated.353fi ^zcu^^ {Figure 5).^ \"bits\" needed to snake these decisions include: (1} information about whether transportation routes to shelters are open, (2) an assessment of the degree of damage to shelters, and (3) an estimate bf the population requiring shelters and the durati.vn. Some information is collected on a daily bas^.s during a disaster by Red Cross volunteer field surveyors. Statistics on the ncxmber of dwellings destroyed, the number of dwellings with major and minor damage, the number of persons sheltered, and the number of shelters opened are gathered. Since these estimates are revised daily, a more or less accurate picture of damage and persons requiring shelter ultimately emerges. What would be more useful, however, is an early accurate estimate of the number of persons requiring shelter so decisions about the number and location of shelters needed and the amount of resource3 to bring into an area could be made. The kind of land use affected by a disaster will influence the numbers of people needing tez^porary housing. For example, if industrial or commer- vial areas were damaged, then housing would not likely:be needed. 'The amount of damage to residences wi11 determine if long-term supplemental hous-- ing needs tv be brought to the community. Mobile homes may serve this purpose. A disaster may do more harm to less sturdy buildings. Therefore, the rate of demolished homes may be higher in some areas than in others. This may be extended to a higher rate of injury yr to higher rates of shelter use, thereby requiring more food and water.38 Shelters provide short-term housing. The nearest undamaged shelters to the stricken area should be chosen for ease of movement. .information about utilities might affect this decis^.on, however. Shelters located where power and water are available might be more appropriate, depending on community resources to either move persons ar provide food and essential services without power and Grater, The number of shelters opened will depend on the size of population affected. Tf persons had been evacuated, then the number Grill be reduced. Zf a widespread area is involved, several shelters may need to open because of inaccessibility to one. Shelter location should be checked against topo- graphy to insure that they are accessible in case of high water. Shelters near the stricken area can be found an. the aerial photographs to determine if they suffered damage. Zf none is apparent, these shelters would be the first to open. If damaged, other shelters need to be identi- fied and the routes to them determined. An accurate assessment of the number of dwelling un^.ts remaining 'or the number damaged i.n a grid area can be determined by aerial photo inter- pretation to decide if shelters are needed. Estimates of population in search of temporary shelter can be based on the numbers of residential units and group quarters r_eed.ing to be evacuated. The geographical extent of the affected area and broad degrees of damage can be determined rapidly. This information would be vital. to the choice of shelter locations and for determining the number required to ^. house the estimated population. if shelter sztes have been noted on maps, tl3ey can be identified on the postdisaster photos to determine if damage has occurred to them andi .f ^-^ _._ ^._h '_ I I I I i I - 39 a 1 if they are accessible from the stricicen area.

Is the local food supply sufficient? and {Z) Is the food supply contaminated?, The information \"bits\" needed to make theses decisions include: (1) an estimate of the number of people who need to be fed and the duration of this need and (2) an estimate of the quantity of food locally available far use. Determination of the suitability of food supplies may be made by chemical and microbiologic Means or by visual inspection, e.g., submerged or bulging canned goods. Responsibil^ .ty to test far food contamination usually lies with the City Health Department as does responsibility for dispa5ing of contaminated food. An estimate of the food supply damage is ust:ally made by the U .S. Department of Agriculture EstimJt^.ng the population in need of food is generally the respansib^.'! .ity of the Red Cross sometimes with the assistance of the Health Department or the Welfare Department. It is the responsibility of local government to obtain, transport, prepare, and distribute food ox to arrange for these things to be done. Sometimes the Red Cross is called on to help perform these tasks. Supplies such as field kitchens may be requested from the military. Transporting food to the disaster site when necessary is also done by the Red Cross and may be accomplished in one of several ways: {1) the National Defense Transportation Association (NDTA) can transport goods via air, sea, land or rail. Tn disasters, they transport goads for the government and the Red Cross at na charge; (2) the military may furnish vehicles; (3) the Red Cross may furnish vehicles; and (4) vehicles may be rented.42i 43 Ta determine whether food is cantamiaated and whether there is an adequate supply, several kinds of information are needed. The condition of food storage establishments must be determined. Roof damage and litter can be identified as well as flood inundation. If an establishment suffers Exam structural damage, then food may not be available from it. Water inundation would contaminate fresh or packaged food and canned fond may also be harmed . Zt is safest not to use canned goads that have been submerged for any length of true. Refrigerated or frozen food will be rendered useless in a matter of hours if power is interrupted. Power plants and substations can be cY^ecked for damage and inundation. Such disruptions can be identified with the aid of photography in disaster -stricicen communities. The supply of uncontaminated food must be assessed in relation to the demands upon it. The number of persons and length of time constitute the drains on food supply. An estiarate of persons can be made from the sheltered population and from the dwelling units without .power but shelter- ing persons, Special food requirements can be estimated by population age structure and by cultural groups affected. For example, infants require different food from adults. The table on the next page summarizes the capability of remote sensing in the function area of food.^^ FOOD & RF3^10TR SR^ISING With baseline data remote sensing can supply the following informa.- tiara \"exits\" about food handling establishments; {1) extent of structural dat^a.ge to food handling establishments, power plants and residential land uses (2) nature of damage {e,g,^inundatian, collapse) (3} accessibility to critical points (e.g., shelters, hospitals) (4)those establishments which should be ground checked far food contamination (5)transportation routes to rece^.ve supplementary sr^pplies Residential includes live-in institutions Idithout baseline data, food warehouses would not be easily identifi- able. Sa^ue grocery stores and restaurants may be recogna.zable by local persons familiar with the area. .: ... .y _ 1 i 1 1 'S 1 F I i46 TRANSPORTATION Implementation of some phases of all relief activities probably involves access to transportation routes. Checking the water and sewer systems, distributing food and water, carrying out rescue operations, providing medical care, and making shelters accessible ali depend on open trans portation routes and on some means of transportation. A great deal of preplanning is necessary to e; ectively execute the tasks outlined an this diagram. For example, arrangements must be made to obtain vehicles and sufficient fuel for them and to perfoxm maintenance operations. In addition, vehicles must be allocated for various tasks such as evacuating people prior to the disaster when possible, moving material (clothing, food, medical supplies, etc.) within the disaster area, and debris clearancE. Evacuation routes may also be predetermined and revised if necessary. Postdisaster, there is an immediate need to determine the condition of mayor transportation routes and, if necessary, to assign priorities for clearing them and/or to designate alternate routes. Controlling the movement of traffic in and around the disaster area, while generally a law and order function, interrelates with designating accessible routes as does coordination of ambulance service to the area. A map and list of essential points in the transportation system would facilitate a survey of usable routes. The sites could be spatted ou postdisaster photos and an assessment of conditions i... .. ., _. ,, ^ .^^ With baseline data the following could be supplied by aerial photos: {1} condition of routes, bridges, railroads, terminals, runways (2) blockage points in system. With this infor^a .tion and an overview of the area, routes could be deter tined which cou^ ,d avoid delays by ambulances, firetrucks and other relief vehicles. Without baseline data, the same information could be realized but at a greater expense of time.48 FIGURE 7 TRANSPORTATION MATER IH^ATION 1 P^rlwifi ^ ^ ^i ^I ^9 Chapter 4 REMOTE SENSING: A SUPPLEMENTARY MEANS OF' DATA GATIiERING FOR l)I5ASTER RELIEF Introduction Collection of information following natural disasters is done primarily by the process of field survey. However, most of the data is not obtained, retarded, processed, and analyzed in a systematic way. In a survey only one agency--the Red Cross- -could be found which has a form for recording infor- nation and does so systematically following natural disasters. {See Form A.) Collection of this information could be useful to persons concerned w^.th several of the functions described in Chapter 3 if information could be accumulated, analyzed, and interpreted early in the acute relief process. In fact, the information they collect is often exchanged with city, state, and federal relief agencies. The field survey procedure leads eventually to accurate and complete data; however, in a laxge disaster, this process may take several weeks. Far example, the Red Crass gathers information an number of persons dead, with injuries or illness, and hospitalized as a result of the disaster. If early, accurate estimates of this data could be made, L-he provision of medical, ser- vices could he managed more efficiently. Information on degree of damage to residential structures (single--family dwellings, mobile homes, and apart- menu) and to small businesses is also collected. Timely information on extent of damage would enhance accurate estimation of the number of shelters and the amount of food required to service the population in the disaster area. Information pertaining to Ghe recovery of other functions such as water and sewerage is also currentJ.y gathered by the time--consuming method11 FViICl THE ^ 2nd q 3Td FINAL FIELDTHIS SPAtE FOR OF NATIONAL pFFI[E ON.

Obtaining an estimate takes from 2G-48 hours. As soon as conditions germit, teams composed of volunteers survey the area and assess damage scored as mayor or minor on a house to house basis. Some information items are obtained from other agencies such as police, fire, civil defense, and insurance companies which make counts of certain items on the Red Cross form. This process usually takes about 1,000 volunteers 2 ar 3 weelcs to survey a city the size of Houston. If more volun- teers ware available, the initial stages of the survey--such as identification of the communities affected--could be expedited, but completion of the survey would still require about 3 weeks. The amount of time required to compile an estimate of the number of ill, injured, hospitalized and dead depends on the availability of cam- munication service as well as on the number of volunteer nurses. It would take 3 to 5 Red Cross nurses 3 or 4 days to make these estimates following a major hurricane in a large city. A need exists far a method of gathering and analyzing data gVickly following a natural disaster. This data would enable disaster managers to make decisions based on accurate timely info^-mat^ .on and thus their actions can be related more specifically to circumstances in the postdisaster environment. This chapter proposes an alternate or supplemental means of data gathering called remote sensing. t,That is remote sensing? What is its role in disaster management? Remote sensing is \"the acquisition of information. about an object (or phenomenon) which is not in intimate contact with the infvrmation- t gathering device\" (Parker and Wolff, 1973}. It is a means of extending our .y_^ ^ - _ _ _ _ ._53 structures. In most cases the type of structure can be identified and the amount and type of visible damage can be assessed {Table 7). 5. The capability to review in much v^ore detail at a l^.ter time things that may be overlooked ^.n other initial surveys. 5. The availability of a permanent record of tYie damage. 7. The only means of obtaining information taken ground truth or Meld survey is not possible. The altitude of. the plane and the focal length of the lens allow for variations in the scale o\u20ac the photographs. By manipulating these variables it is passible to obtain large scale or close-up v^.ews or arl overall view of an area. Although the pattern of damage may vary with the type of natural, disaster, this does not affect the process of photo ixlterpretation. The same system can be utilized for any natural d^.saster which results il? observable, physical damage. TApZ^ 71 T e of Eracilit 1.

[ 'henical contaminatlan cannot be discerned by ar_:ial phntngrnphy. What is needed to put this system into operation? Where can it be obtained? Tkle elements required to make this system work include an aircraft (fixed wing or a helicopter}, camera(s}, cameramen, film processing personnel and equipment, a photo interpreter, and photo interpretation equipment. Se?ected technical information about types of film and cameras apgears in Appendix A. The sophistication of this system may vary from a military air- plane with several mounted camera systems using a variety of film types to an observer in a helicopter or small plane using a handheld camera or simply recording information on a map or in a log. A means of acquiring remote sensing data must be arranged for in advance of a natural disaster. The most technically advanced source of remote sensing capability is a reconnaissance wing of the military or ^. commercial firm that i specializes in aerial photography. The photo interpreter's skills are avail- '^ able YhrougY^ both sources. Since most photo interpreters are trained in the m^\u20aclitary, they are trained to observe military environments. There is little difference, however., between civilian and military environments in terms of i signatures to identify on . - I - ^56 It may be possible in same cities to arrange far the militar y to overfly and photograph the disaster area. For example in Texas aerial reconnaissance may be requested from the Air Force by the State Emergency Operating Center (Civil Defense} following a disaster. These arrangements are informal but may be formalized in some states. If this source is not available, contracts may be made with local commercial aerial photography companies. Tf this option is used, a minimum six months planning period is recommended. The costs and time involved in utilizing remote sensing in a disaster relief situation will vary according t^ the number of flights, the sophisti- cation of the equipment, the type of film (color or black and white}, the extent of the area photographed, and the detail of the information needed by the disaster manager. Far example, to film a disaster using military planes and equipment takes approximately two hours to get airborne, plus flying time to and Pram the disaster site, with about 5 or 10 minutes ^a film the disaster. Black and white film can be processed at the rate of about 15 feet per minute. The time required to perform photo interpretation varies with the size of the area, the number of photo interpreters, the complexity of the area (e.g., density of structures}, and the facilities available (e. g., light tables, etc.). A cursory analysis of a city the size of Austin, Texas (1000 squat >^ miles/250,000 population) would take one p hoto interpreter about 1 l/2 hours (15Q' of film). An observes in a helicopter can facilitate the photo interpretation pro- ; cess by identifying quickly those areas where the heaviest damage has vccur- red. Crew members also can aid the photo interpreter by defining their actual flight route, identifying where they started to film (frame number), and specifying where the heaviest damage begins vn the film.How does remote sensing fit into the disaster relief pxocess? How is this data transmitted to disaster managers? Remote sensing can provide much of the information that disaster managers use to make decisions about relief needs. Specific decisions and the infor- motion \"bits\" required to resolve them were elaborated in Chapter 3. Many of the information \"bits\" needed by persons in agencies responsible for relief and recovery overlap, and a method for centralizing data collection is vary desirable. Far remote sensing data to have an impact on disaster management a communication network must exist so that disaster managers can receive this information. As emghasized in Chapter 2, it is a prerequisite that everyone involved--disaster managers and remote sensing personnel--have the same in- formation base 4for example maps) in order to establish common reference points fax communication. P^.ps of the affected area need to be immediately available to all department heads and relief workers who are assessing local conditions and relaying such information to a central point. Relief workers dispatched far picking up the injured ar alleviating threatening conditions must also be supplied with accurate maps which are uniform in terms of scale and have common map coordinates. Such maps arm necessary for locating areas of disaster conditions and important sites within the affected community such as pumping stations or hospitals. As discussed in Chapter 2, it would be useful to have available certain information about the predisaster area. phis information may be obtained from predisaster photographs or from maps. predisaster photographs also enable the photo interpreter to identify signatures on a photograph more rapidly by clarifying questionable structures in areas where heavy damage has occurred.^^58 Y_ ; ^ i.They also can be used i.f maps are unavailable to divide a community into areas on a grid for immediate postdisaster survey. Sdith photographs it is possible to impose a grid which could be used as a reap. An accurate overall assessment of population and area size affected by the disaster should first be made. Small scale (1:18,OOD) photography may be preferred for identifying the extent of the damage since this scale gives an overview of an area. The photo interpreter can identify the affected grid squares and fatal the population and acres {or square miles, etc,) An estimate of areas of potentially most severe, mediuza severe and least severe injury levels can then be made based an degree and patterns of damage. The numbers of the grid squares needing relief can be relayed ta. all map-holders for accurate lncational identification. Nature and severity of the disaster', hour and day, warning and preven- tive action, are also necessary inputs to the accurate interpretation of photographs and to the decision-making process. Th^.s information is necessary in order to determine if medical care is needed and, if it is, to estimate the extent and possibly the nature of injuries and deaths. For example, if the disaster occurred at night, whether ar not the business districts of an area were damaged would not be as important a cons^.deratian as if the disaster had occurred during working hours. After the number and types of injuries have been estimated, an evaluation of the damage to medical facilities Must be made and their capacity to service the injured must be assessed. If regular medical facilities are not intact or are inadequate, supplemental. facilities must be found. One alternative is first aid stations and field hospitals. Both an assessment of damage to medi- cal facilities and vacations of alternate treatment centers map be made by remote sensing.S9 Maps showing utility grids, water main/sewerage systems, pipeline, topography, and physical structures will invariably prove useful in assessing damage to the water and sewer system. Prior information about the locations of water wells and pumping stations, storage tanks, hydrants, sewer treatment plants, and sewer pumps will facilitate the photo interpretation process. If this data has not been coded an maps or predisaster photographs, persons familiar with these systems could assist the photo interpreter in locating these structures. When they have been located an the photographs, degree of damage can be determined. Once the area in which the water system is not functioning has been identified, an estimate of the population in need of potab:^e water or sat itary facilities can be made and a method of supplying these needs can be determined. Estimating the population 3.n need and identify- ing routes for bringing water or supplemental facilities into the disaster area lend themselves to remote sensing. Based on pattern and amount of damage, the photo interpreter can determine whether or not shelters are needed and the approximate number and location of those in need. Damaged and inaccessible shelters also can: be identified. This will ensure a more efficXent selection of the location and number of shelters to be opened and the number of personnel required to staff them. Detailed analysis of degree of damage may reveal that a certain per- centage of the population will require long-term temporary housing (such as mobile homes), and selection of sites may be made through remote sensing. ' Assessing the need for and the availability of food is another important ''. function in the disaster relief process. It is not possible through remote sensing to assess directly whether or not food has been contaminated. It is possible, however, with predisaster information to determine the extent of . structural damage to food handling establishments and the nature of this indicating which warehouses and establishments should be ground checked for contaminated food. Transporta- tion routes for bringing in food, if necessary, can be identified. As mentioned previously, performance of all functions depends to same degree on accessible and adequate transportation routes. Remote sensing is an extremely efficient method far identi\u20acying open routes in the pastdisaster environment. What are some of the limitations of remote sensing? Remote sensing is one of the tools of a disaster manager, but it may not be applicable in all disaster situati^ts. Size o\u20ac the disaster is an important determinant in whether ox not to use remote sensing. Field surveys may be the most timely source of information in small tornadoes and localized flooding. However, for hurricanes, mayor \u20acloads, and earthquakes remote sensing may provide mare timely and accurate information. Communication net- works, weather conditions, predisaster planning, and equipment available (aircraft, cameras, film, processing and interpreting \u20acacilities, and special pexsonnel) are variables in the remote sensing data gathering and information provision system which may limit its availability and use. For example, the clarity of photographs will depend on the type o\u20ac film, the altitude of the plane, photographic equipment, and weather conditions at the time o\u20ac flight. The operation of this system needs to be considered in relation to the above named variables. Conclusion Remote sensing technology is presently available and can be used to provide information which will specify relic\u20ac needs and e^cpedite the delivery,.^.. k - _'?! V I I I of relief.
