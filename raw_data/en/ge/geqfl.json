Aluminium (as a lumin ium hydroxide ), amino acids for injection, disodium phosphate, polysorbate 20, potassium neomycin DESCRIPTION HAVRIX (hepatitis A vac cine, inactivated) is a sterile suspension containing formaldehyde -inactivated hepatitis A virus (HM175 hepatitis A virus strain) adsorbed onto alumin ium hydroxide. Page 4 of 24 INDICATIONS AND CLINICAL USE HAVRIX (hepatitis A vaccine, inactivated ) is indicated for active immunization against disease caused by hepatitis A virus (HAV) . HAVRIX is approved for use in persons 12 months of age and older. Primary immunization should be administered at least 2 weeks prior to anticipa ted exposure to HAV . Please refer to the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) and the Canadian Immunization Guide for recommendations of use. CONTRAINDICATIONS HAVRIX (hepatitis A vaccine, i nactivated ) should not be administered: to subjects with known hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine preparation or component of the container , or to subjects having shown signs of hypersensitivity after previous HAVRIX administration. For a complete listing, see the DOSAGE FORMS, COMPOSITION AND PACKAGING s ection of the product monograph. As with other vaccines, the administration of HAVRIX should be postponed in subjects with severe febrile illness. The presence of a minor infection however, is not a contraindi cation. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS General As with other injectable vaccines, appropriate medication (e.g. adrenaline) should be readily available for immediate use in case of anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions follo wing administration of the vaccine. For this reason, the vaccinee should remain under medical supervision for 30 minutes after immunization. Syncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle i njection. It is important that procedures are in place to avoid injury from faints. Hematologic HAVRIX (hepatitis A vaccine, i nactivated) should be administered with caution to subjects with thrombocytopenia or a bleeding disorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration to these subjects. Page 5 of 24 Immune It is possible that subjects may be in the incubation period of hepatitis A infection at the time of immunization. It is not known whether HAVRIX will prevent hepatitis A in such cases. Since there is a possibility that the vaccine may contain trace amounts of neomycin, the possibility of an allergic reaction in individuals sensitive to this substance should be kept in mind when considering the use of this vaccine ( see DOSAGE FORMS, COMP OSITION AND PACKAGING ). As with other vaccines, subjects with an impaired immune system may not obtain adequate antibody titres after the primary immunization course. Such patients may require administration of additional doses of HAVRIX. However, no sp ecific dosing recommendations can be made at this time. Renal As with other vaccines, hemodialysis patients may not obtain adequate antibody titres after the primary immunization course. Such patients may require administration of additional doses of HAV RIX. However, no specific dosing recommendations can be made at this time. Special Populations Pregnant Women: Animal reproduction studies and adequate human data on use during pregnancy are not available. However, as with all inactivated viral va ccines, the risks to the fetus are considered to be negligible. HAVRIX should be used during pregnancy only when clearly needed. Nursing Women: Animal reproduction studies and adequate human data on use during lactation are not available. Therefore, ca ution should be exercised if HAVRIX is to be administered to breast feeding women. ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trial Adverse Drug Reactions Because clinical trials are conducted under very specific conditions the adverse reactio n rates observed in the clinical trials may not reflect the rates observed in practice and should not be compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug. Adverse drug reaction information from clinical trials is useful for identifying drug- related adverse events and for approximating rates . Page 6 of 24 The safety profile presented below is based on data from more than 5,300 subjects. Frequency of doses Adverse Event System/Organ Class Very Common: 10% Irritability Psychiatric disorders Headac he Nervous system disorders Pain and redness at the injection site, fatigue General disorders and administration site conditions Common: 1% and < 10% Appetite loss Metabolism and nutrition disorders Drowsiness Nervous system disorders Gastrointe stinal symptoms (such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) Gastrointestinal disorders Malaise, injection site reaction (such as swelling or induration), fever ( 37.5\u00b0C) General disorders and administration site conditions Uncommon: 0.1% and < 1% Upper res piratory tract infection, rhinitis Infections and infestations Dizziness Nervous system disorders Rash Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Myalgia, musculoskeletal stiffness Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Influenza -like illness General disorders and administration site conditions Rare: 0.01% and < 0.1% Hypoaesthesia, paraesthesia Nervous system disorders Pruritus Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Chills General disorders and administration site conditions Adminis tration of HAVRIX with measles -mumps (V) vaccines In a co -administration study (HAV 231) evaluating immune response in toddlers receiving HAVRIX 720 Junior (N=324) or HAVRIX 720 plus HAVRIX 720 Junior (N=455), the primary analysis of safety (N=1,241) demonstrated that all the three vaccines, HAVRIX, MMR and varicella, whether co -administered or administered alone, were well tolerated. Re actogenicity and safety of HAVRIX when co -administered with MMR/V vaccines is consistent with the known safety profile of HAVRIX. Post-Market Adverse Drug Reactions The following adverse reactions have been reported with HAVRIX. Immune system disorders Anaphylaxis, allergic reactions including anaphylactoid reactions and mimicking serum sickness Nervous system disorders Convulsions Vascular disorders connective tissue disorders Arthralgia Page 7 of 24 DRUG INTERACTIONS Overview Since HAVRIX is an inactivated vaccine, its concomitant use with other inactivated vaccines is unlikely to result in interference with immune responses. When concomitant administration of other vaccines is considered necessary, the vaccines must be given with different syringes and at different injection sites. Clinical experiences with the concomitant administration of HAVRIX and the recombinant hepatitis B virus vaccine, EN GERIX -B, has been satisfactory. No interference in the respective immune responses to both antigens has been observed. HAVRIX can be given concomitantly with any of the following vaccines: typhoid, yellow fever, ch olera (injectable), tetanus, or combination vaccines comprised of measles, mumps, rubella and varicella. See also Clinical T rials section. HAVRIX must not be mixed with other vaccines. Drug -Drug Interactions The concomitant administra tion of HAVRIX (hepatitis A vaccine, inactivated) and immune globulin (human) does not influence the seroconversion rate, but may result in a relatively lower anti- HAV antibody titr e than when the vaccine is given alone. HAVRIX and immune globulin (human) should be administered at separate injection sites. Drug -Food Interactions Interactions with food have not been established. Drug -Herb Interactions Interactions with herbal products have not been established. Drug -Laboratory Interactions Interactions w ith laboratory tests have not been established. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended Dose and Dosage Adjustment Primary Immunization Adults from 19 years onwards A single dose of HA VRIX 1440 (hepatitis A vaccine, i nactivated ) (1 mL suspension) is used for primary immunization. Page 8 of 24 Children and adolescents from 1 year up to and including 18 years of age A single dose of HAVRIX 720 Junior (0.5 mL suspension) is used for primary immunization . Booster Dose A booster dose is recommended at any time between 6 and 12 months after a single dose of HAVRIX 1440 or HAVRIX 720 Junior in order to ensure long- term protectio n. Long- term persistence of serum antibodies to hepatitis A virus after vaccination with HAVRIX is under eval uation. Nevertheless, data available after 5 years show persistence of antibodies which is consistent with a projected 20 years persistence (base d on mathematical calculations). Concomitant administration with immune globulin (human) Concomitant administrat ion of HAVRIX and immune globulin (human) may be considered when a subject is at risk of being exposed to hepatitis A before adequate anti - HAV antibody titres can be reached. Administration HAVRIX should be injected intramuscularly in the deltoid region i n adults and children, in the antero- lateral part of the thigh in young children up to 2 years of age. The vaccine should not be administered intramuscularly in the gl uteal region or subcutaneously/ intradermally since administration by these routes may result in a less than optimal anti- HAV antibody response. As with all parenterals, vaccine products should be inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or discolouration prior to administration. Before use of HAVRIX, the syringe should be w ell shaken to obtain a slightly opaque, white suspension. Discard the vaccine if the contents of the syringe appear otherwise. The vaccine must be used as supplied. Page 9 of 24 Syringe Instructions To attach the needle to the syringe, refer to the drawing below 1. Holding the syringe barrel in one hand (avoid holding the syringe plunger), unscrew the syringe cap by twisting it anticlockwise. 2. To attach the needle to the syringe, twist the needle clockwise into the syringe until you fee l it lock (see drawing). 3. Remove the needle protector, which on occasion can be a little stiff. 4. Administer the vaccine. Note: The syringe provided with HAVRIX might be slightly different (without screw thread) than the syringe in the above drawing. In that case, the needle should be attached following the below instructions. Do not remove the white back -stop from the syr inge. Prior to administration, ensure that the plunger rod is firmly attached to the rubber stopper by turning the plunger clockwise until slight resistance is felt. Do not over tighten. Remove syringe LUER Tip-cap and needle cap. Attach needle by pres sing and twisting in a clockwise rotation until secured to the syringe. Needle Needle protector Syringe Syringe cap Syringe barrel Syringe plunger Needle protector Page 10 of 24 HAVRIX should never be administered intraveno usly. OVERDOSAGE For management of a suspected drug overdose, contact your regional Poison Control Centre. Cases of overdose have been reported during post -marketing surveillance. Adverse events reported following overdosage were sim ilar to those reported with normal vaccine administration. ACTION AND CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action HAVRIX (hepatitis A vaccine, inactivated) confers immunity against hepatitis A virus (HAV) infe ction by inducing the production of specific anti -HAV antibodies. Immune response In clinical studies involving subjects of 18 - 50 yea rs of age, specific humoral antibodies against HAV were detected in more than 88% of vaccine es at day 15 and 99% at mont h 1 following administration of a single dose of HAVRIX 1440 (hepatitis A vaccine, inactivated). In clinical studies involving subjects of 1 - 18 years of age, specific humoral antibodies against HAV were detected in more than 93% of vaccine es at day 15 a nd 99% of vaccinees one month following administration of HAVRIX 720 Junior. The mean titr e of anti -HAV antibodies induce d by HAVRIX is at least 3 times higher than the maximum observed after passive immunization using immune globulin (human). In a randomly selected subset of subjects, vaccine induced anti -HAV antibodies were Page 11 of 24 shown to be qualitatively indistinguishable from immune globul in (human) anti -HAV antibodies. To obtain long- term immunity a booster dose is recommended at any time between 6 and 12 mo nths after primary vaccination with HAVRIX 1440 Adult or HAVRIX 720 Junior , to induce long- term antibody titr es. Long- term persisten ce of serum antibodies to hepatitis A virus after vaccination with HAVRIX is under evaluation. Nevertheless, data avail able after 5 years show persistence of antibodies which is consistent with a projected 20 years persistence (based on mathematical calcu lations). Primates exposed to the virulent heterologous hepatitis A strain were vaccinated 2 days after exposure. This post exposure vaccination resulted in total protection of the animals. Efficacy of HAVRIX for outbreak control Results of hepatitis A outbreak control program showed a substantial drop in symptomatic cases in 4,930 vaccinees within 3 weeks of receiving 1 dose of hepatitis A vaccine. In villages where more than 70% of estimated susceptible individuals were vaccinated, a dramatic drop in the number of symptomatic cases of disease was observed within 8 weeks of vaccination. Immunization Recommendations (se e also Canadian Immunization Guide) Active immunization with HAVRIX is indicated for the following individuals: Armed Forces personnel w ho travel to higher endemicity areas or to areas where hygiene is poor have an increased risk of HAV infection, close conta cts of infected persons since virus shedding of infected persons may occur for a prolonged period, individuals with chronic liver dis ease or who are at risk of developing chronic liver disease such as hepatitis B (HB) and hepatitis C (HC) chronic carrie rs and alcohol abusers and susceptible individuals in areas of intermediate to high prevalence of hepatitis A. Immunization with HAVR IX is particularly recommended in subjects who are, or will be, at increased risk of infection such as: travellers (i.e. , to areas where the prevalence of hepatitis A is high), persons for whom hepatitis A is an occupational hazard (i.e., employees in day- care centres, nursing, medical and paramedical personnel in hospitals and institutions, especially gastroenterology and ped iatric units, sewage workers, and food handlers), persons for whom there is an increased risk of transmission of Hepatitis A (i.e., homosexuals, persons with multiple sexual partners, abusers of injectable drugs, hemophiliac patients), specific populati on groups known to have higher incidence of Hepatitis A (i.e., North American Indians, Inuits, recognized community- wide HAV epidemics). STORAGE AND STABILITY The vaccine should not be used beyond the expiry date stampe d on the syringe. Page 12 of 24 Store HAVRIX (hepatitis A vaccine, inactivated) in the original package in order to protect from light. The vaccine must be stored at 2 to 8\u00b0C. Do not freeze ; discard if vaccine has been frozen. Stability data indicate that HAVRIX is sta ble at temperatures up to 25\u00b0C for 3 days. These data are intended to guide healthcare professionals in case of temporary temperature excursion only. DOSAGE FORMS, COMPOSITION AND PACKAGING Dosage Form s HAVRIX (hepatitis A vaccine, inactivated) is available as HAVRIX 1440 (1440 E LISA Units/mL) and HAVRIX 720 Junior (720 ELISA U nits/0.5 mL) suspension for injection. Composition HAVRIX is a sterile suspension containing formaldehyde -inactivated hepatitis A virus (HM175 hepatitis A virus strain) adsorbed onto alumini um hydroxide. The virus is propagated in MRC 5 human diploid ce lls. Before viral extraction, the cells are extensively washed to remove culture medium constituents. A virus suspension is then obtained by lysis of the cells followed by purification using ultrafiltration techniques and gel chromatography. Inactivation of the virus is assured by treatment with formalin. The viral antigen content of HAVRIX is determined by an ELISA test. Each dos e is standardized to ensure a viral antigen content of not less than: ELISA U nits Dose Volume HAVRIX 1440 1440 1 mL HAVRI X 720 Junior 720 0.5 mL The virus is adsorbed on alumini um (0.5 mg/1 mL adult dose, 0.25 mg/0.5 mL pediatric dose) in the form of alumin ium hydroxide.

Antibodies were measured at screening, day 15, and at month 1 and 6. In an overall analysis of immunogenicity following vaccination the seroconversion rate was 98.9% at month 1 and the Geometric Mean Titre was 466 mIU/mL. Clinical studies performed in Asia, Europe, Latin America, and Alaska (HAV 115, 117B, 118, 122, 129 and Alaskan outbreak program) evaluated immune response in subjects between 2 and 18 yea rs receiving 720 EL.U. The overall analysis of immunogenicity following vaccination showed that the seroconversion rate was 99.3% at month 1 and the Geometric Mean Titre was 253 mIU/mL. Administration of HAVRIX with measles (MMR) and varicella (V) vaccines A co -administration study (HAV 231) evaluated immune response in toddlers receiving HAVRIX 720 Junior (group 1) or HAVRIX 720 Junior + MMR + V vaccines (group 2) or MMR + V + HAVRIX 720 Junior (group 3). Study HAV 231 demonstrated non- inferiority of anti-HAV immune res ponse 31 days after the 2nd dose of HAVRIX when the 1st dose had been co- administered with MMR + V compared to HAVRIX alone (1st co-primary objective ). HAV 231 also demonstrated non- inferiority of the MMR + V immune responses 42 days after the first dose of MMR co-administered with varicella and HAVRIX vaccines compared to MMR + V alone (2nd co-primary objective). A ll antigens in study HAV 231, including anti -measles, anti -rubella and anti -varicella antibodies , had similar immu ne responses in the co -adminis tration group (HAV+MMR+V) and control groups (HAV Group and the MMR+V - HAV group) . Thus, co- administration of HAVRIX with MMR and varicella vaccines does not impact the immunogenicity of either of these vaccines .
