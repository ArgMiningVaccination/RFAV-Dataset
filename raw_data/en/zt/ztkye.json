Ben van Beurden Chief Executive Officer, Royal Dutch Shell plc New technologies can reshape the world, including its energy system. They have done so many times in the past: from the internal combustion engine to seismic imaging and from the silicon chip to the wind turbine. This issue of Shell TechXplorer Digest gives an overview of some of the most promising new technologies Shell is working on today. Many of these technologies will enable us to provide low-carbon energy solutions to our customers and accelerate our transition to a net-zero-emissions energy business, and, in time, they may even help to reshape the world's energy system. For example, we are exploring ways to develop zero-carbon fuels for many sectors, including aviation. Here you can learn about a new technology for aviation, an industry that cannot easily switch to renewable power so needs to find its own way to cut emissions (p. 30). Or take shipping, another hard-to-abate sector. We have been testing a new technology that uses air lubrication for ships. This technology creates a carpet of bubbles for the ship to sail on, which reduces fuel consumption and emissions (p. 71). And there is digitalisation. One technology you can read more about is digital-based predictive maintenance. With this technology, many of our assets across the world are benefiting from algorithms that process years of historical data and monitor equipment 24 hours a day, seven days a week to alert engineers of operating anomalies, which can help to prevent potential production deferment and unplanned maintenance (p. 62). You can also read about new ways to deal with uncertainty in the analysis of reservoir rocks (p. 20), more effective ways to prevent sand from reaching the surface when we produce oil and gas (p. 12), the viability of biogas made from food waste (p. 82), ways to improve battery performance (p. 6) and much, much more. The technologies you will find in this issue are all very different, but they have one thing in common: they support our Powering Progress strategy and our efforts to help reshape the world's energy system to achieve net-zero emissions. I hope you enjoy this showcase for some of our most exciting new technologies.\"A new technology could enable a ship to sail on a carpet of bubbles and, thus, reduce fuel consumption and emissions.\"Shell TechXplorer Digest | 202143 6 93REGULAR FEATURESCONTENTS Beurden OPEN FRONTIERS Improving battery performance: Sulphur, so good This yellow element could provide a solution to building a better battery. adVENTURE Green sky thinking: Hydrogen-fuel-cell technology takes off ZeroAvia's hydrogen-electric fuel cell technology could help Shell to decarbonise the difficult-to-abate air transport sector.

The good news is that, in many parts of the world, power from the sun and wind is becoming available at scale and at a cost that is comparable to, and increasingly below, conventionally generated electricity. The trouble with these renewable energy resources is intermittency; output varies over timescales that range from seconds to days or months, or even vary from season to season. This, and the need to store electricity for off-grid applications such as powering electric vehicles (EV), is driving research into ever more capable rechargeable batteries to store energy for use when the sun does not shine and the wind does not blow. Low weight is important in some battery applications; in others, the ability to store energy in the smallest possible volume is more valuable. EV batteries must deliver high power but have a low weight and volume, whereas the size and weight of grid-scale batteries may be less important than their ability to store very large amounts of energy, perhaps for long periods. In all cases, the displacement of conventionally generated electricity by renewable energy will be accelerated by the availability of cheaper batteries. The story so far The development of commercial lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries has changed the world in the last two or three decades. In many ways, lithium is the ideal element for the negative electrode (anode) of a battery, but the use of lithium metal in a conventional electrochemical battery has proved to be impractical. Instead, Li-ion batteries rely on a method of storing lithium ions that is sufficiently novel to have won its inventors the 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. IMPROVING BATTERY PERFORMANCE: SULPHUR, SO GOOD Shell knows sulphur; as this is a coproduct of much of its oil and gas production, it has to. And few in Shell know the yellow element better than Guy Verbist. Working with Indranil Rudra at Shell Technology Centre Bangalore (STCB), India, and Polymer Technology Group Eindhoven (PTG/e), the Netherlands, he has applied knowledge gained in the development of recyclable, low carbon dioxide emission sulphur concrete to a very different green application. Here, Guy and Indranil describe early-stage work that has the potential to make sulphur a key component in a new generation of lightweight, low-cost and high-energy-density rechargeable batteries. Sulphur, which has to be extracted from the raw bitumen from tar sands, piled up in huge mountains by an upgrader plant near Fort McMurray, Canada.7 Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021All batteries have three essential components: two electrodes and a permeable, electrically insulating electrolyte to separate them. In traditional batteries, materials from the electrodes are converted to chemical compounds that carry ions through the electrolyte to the opposite electrode. Rechargeable lead-acid batteries, for example, are conversion batteries; they reversibly convert lead and sulphuric acid into lead sulphate and water while exchanging hydrogen ions and electrons. In Li-ion batteries, no conversion takes place. Ions are inserted and trapped, or intercalated, within the layers of a graphite anode. During discharge, they move through the electrolyte to the cathode, which typically comprises magnesium, iron or nickel oxides with varying amounts of cobalt and also stores ions by intercalation. A better battery The appropriation of Li-ion batteries for applications other than consumer electronics, for example, to power EVs that compete with or outperform legacy vehicles, has provided valuable signals that electrification is a realistic route to decarbonisation. But they are far from perfect. The graphite used to store lithium ions by intercalation limits the specific energy density of Li-ion batteries, that is, the amount of energy they can hold for a given weight. It is typically less than one-tenth of the maximum that is theoretically possible using a lithium metal anode. And Li-ion battery cathode materials are dense and contain scarce elements. Overall, the technology results in rather costly, large and heavy batteries having less than optimal capacity; the battery in a popular mid-range EV weighs 480 kg, occupies all the underfloor space between the wheels and costs many thousands of dollars. They key to improving battery technology may be to go back to basics. What powers a battery is the difference in the ability of the electrodes to Chemical attraction The periodic table of elements holds the key to optimising the choice of electrode materials. At the top of the table are elements that have low density, to the left are elements with low electronegativity, and the elements to the right are highly electronegative ( Figure 1 ). Light and powerful rechargeable batteries pair electrodes comprising elements from the top left and top right of the table in a way that enables the reversible exchange of ions within the battery during the charge and discharge cycles.\"New Energies Research & Technology has explored whether sulphur can contribute to energy storage.\" ElectronegativityMonovalent alkali 2.2 2.5 2.8 3.1Divalent alkaline earth metals Density Low Low HighHighChalcogens Tendency to attract electrons from other elementsExcluding unstable radioactive elements francium and radium FIGURE 1 Periodic table of the elements with electronegativity <1.0 and >2.5. Elements with the lowest electronegativity are found in groups 1 and 2 of the periodic table (left); solids with the highest electronegativity include sulphur and are found in groups 16 and 17 (right).IMPROVING BATTERY PERFORMANCE: SULPHUR, SO GOOD Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021 8attract electrons; their electronegativity. Chemists know, at least in theory, how to significantly improve conversion batteries by using electrodes selected from light elements with large differences in electronegativity (see boxed text, Chemical attraction). Lithium metal remains the preferred anode material; it is the least electronegative element and not much more than half the density of its rivals. For the cathode, sulphur is an obvious choice; it is relatively light and more electronegative than any other solid except the much denser iodine. It is also inexpensive and more easily sourced than cobalt and other elements used in Li-ion batteries. Combined in a conversion battery, lithium and sulphur have the potential to deliver lighter, more easily recycled batteries that have much higher energy densities at lower cost than current technologies. Sulphur challenges The promise of lithium-sulphur (Li-S) conversion batteries was identified as early as 1977 , the same year in which the intercalation of lithium in graphite was first demonstrated. Although intercalation led to the commercialisation of Li-ion batteries in 1991, Li-S cells have largely remained in laboratories. Despite extensive research (more than 1,000 peer- reviewed papers have been published in the past decade), unique chemical and physical challenges have thwarted efforts to mass-produce practical Li-S batteries. Much work has been done to overcome the issues associated with lithium metal anodes, but using sulphur as a cathode is at least as challenging, and only a few bespoke applications have been found to date. One of the most significant challenges in making Li-S batteries is that sulphur is an insulator, so ways of conducting electrons must be provided. Another is that elemental sulphur can take more forms at the molecular level than any other element; changes from one allotrope to another occur readily and result in large changes in volume during charging and discharging, which can disrupt contact with the current collector. Sulphur also has complex chemistry, particularly when reacted with lithium. However, overcoming what is known as the polysulphide shuttle effect is perhaps the most difficult challenge faced by would-be Li-S battery makers (see boxed text, Comings and goings). This causes the cathode to progressively lose sulphur, thereby lowering the long-term charge-discharge efficiency and stability of the battery, and reducing the cycle life. Concrete solutions The Shell New Energies Research & Technologies (NERT) group runs three long-range research programmes that aim to address intermittency in Comings and goings At ambient conditions, the most stable sulphur allotrope comprises crown-shaped rings of eight atoms. When chemically reduced, these break open to form long polysulphides, linear chains of two to eight sulphur atoms. While lithium ions migrate to the sulphur cathode of an Li-S conversion battery, the unwanted long polysulphides tend to diffuse into the electrolyte, where they attract lithium ions and carry them back to the cathode. Two sulphur atoms and the lithium ions remain bound at the cathode while the shortened polysulphide, now with six sulphur atoms, returns to the anode and repeats the process, shuttling back and forth until the last two lithium ions are deposited on the cathode as the battery becomes discharged ( Figure 2 ). FIGURE 2 During discharge, lithium ions from the anode migrate through the electrolyte to the sulphur cathode. At the same time, unwanted polysulphides shuttle to and from the cathode where they leave two lithium ions and two sulphur atoms with each trip. Ideally, all the sulphur in solution would be reoxidised to S8 during charging, but polysulphides that leak into the electrolyte do not completely revert. Some sulphur remains in solution in the electrolyte while lithium remains on the cathode. This so-called shuttle effect is fundamental to the working of Li-S batteries, but it is one of the main reasons that their commercialisation remains elusive.

These include one that is looking into synthetic fuels. Another, the Advanced Energy Storage programme, is concerned with fundamental phenomena and aims to improve battery functionality by identifying and harnessing the inherent and emergent properties of materials. With many questions remaining about the economics of different types of battery and how long they can store electricity, NERT has explored whether sulphur can contribute to energy storage. Guy describes how he became involved: \"New materials are key to the energy transition and my expertise is in materials science. I am lucky to work in the Shell materials and corrosion group on new functional materials that include electrodes for energy storage and electrolysis. For several years, I also served as a part-time professor in the chemical engineering and chemistry faculty at Eindhoven University of Technology, the Netherlands, where I collaborated with PTG/e, which does contract and commercial research work, including looking at ways to use sulphur.\" Guy's work at Eindhoven contributed to the development of Shell Thiocrete technology, which enables recyclable moulded elemental sulphur to be used to replace Portland-cement-based concrete in certain applications. The first of these was green railway sleepers, but other applications include acid-resistant sewer pipes. The seed of the idea that Guy brought to his work on Li-S batteries came from his work on Thiocrete. \"NERT supported the idea of applying 'Thiocrete thinking' to batteries. So, about five years ago and working with the PTG/e team, we started to contribute to the Advanced Energy Storage programme. I knew sulphur had great potential as a lightweight cathode, but it does not host lithium ions by intercalation. That meant that conversion chemistry would be required. I immediately saw an overlap with the work on sulphur concrete, so we started to focus on this area. At that stage, we thought 'sulphur is going to save the day', but then we started to consider the problems!\" What Guy had recognised was the potential to repurpose commercially available chemicals that he had used as coupling agents to prevent cracking in large sulphur components. These components, the organosilane polymers bis(triethoxysilylpropyl) disulphide and bis(triethoxysilylpropyl) tetrasulphide (TESPT), comprise short chains of two and four sulphur atoms respectively that form a bridge between two identical organic structures ( Figure 3 ). Initially, Guy considered them as way of preventing cracking in elemental sulphur cathodes, but then he had a revelation. \"I realised that by splitting the coupling agent in two we could expose a source of sulphur that might be used in a battery. I knew that would be easier than breaking open sulphur rings, and the longest polysulphide that could be released would have only two sulphur atoms, too few to be soluble in the electrolyte. That would eliminate the polysulphide shuttle effect!\" Seeing is believing To demonstrate if the proposed chemistry would work in practice, Guy needed an experimental chemistry laboratory. Shell's dedicated sulphur research facilities have made many breakthroughs in desulphurisation technologies, including the Shell Claus off-gas treating process that is now widely used to recover as much as 99.98% of sulphur from refinery processes, but the proposed experiments required different facilities. Instead, Guy drew on his relationship with PTG/e, which provided the resources he needed. Guy recounts how the first experiments were conducted within a few days of being conceived. \"The sulphur chemistry seemed feasible but, given the exploratory nature of the work, we adopted an agile approach with a learner mindset. Hydrogen Carbon Oxygen Silicon Sulphur t = 15 m t = 3 h t = 44 h t = 72 h t = 168 h a b c d eIMPROVING BATTERY PERFORMANCE: SULPHUR, SO GOOD Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021 10Initially, we set up a simple time-sequence experiment at the PTG/e laboratory to see whether the TESPT sulphur bridge could be split and shortened and, if so, whether the lithium sulphides formed would recombine ( Figure 4 ). \"They did not recombine and, because no polysulphides with more than four sulphur atoms were created, we were able to confirm our hope that the approach had the potential to eliminate the polysulphide shuttle effect. The next question was whether an electric circuit could be completed by grafting the organic end onto a conductive surface in a way that would enable the flow of electrons. I am just a theoretical physicist; for that, I needed help!\" A calculated approach Guy knew where to go for insights into the chemistry. He was able to draw on the expertise of the computational chemistry and materials science team at STCB to test his hypothesis. Indranil, who manages the team, takes up the story. \"Computational chemistry and materials science are recognised as enabling capabilities for Shell's long-range research because they cut across different programmes. I had been involved in long-range research themes, including the Advanced Energy Storage programme, from the early days and, within the Shell Projects & Technology organisation, we were already looking at some of the fundamental physics and chemistry problems in collaboration with other technology platforms when Guy contacted us. \"Our challenges were to understand whether this organosulphur compound would have any conductivity and if it could be grafted onto a current collector. We thought it would probably not form polysulphides when it split, but we also did quite a bit of computation to understand the possible reaction pathways and products. Our modelling and simulation approach was much easier and quicker than doing it experimentally.\" While Indranil's group was doing the theoretical work on characterising the grafting of the molecule onto aluminium, it worked closely with PTG/e, which completed the experimental characterisation that proved this was possible. Early, simple simulations showed that the inherent conductivity was not expected to be high. Nevertheless, Guy and Indranil were optimistic that secondary pathways for electrons might be exploited or that carbon black could be used to enhance the conductivity. The initial indication was that conductivity could be improved sufficiently to justify progressing to a proof of concept, but Guy is keen to point out that this is just the beginning. \"In a research environment,\" he says, \"we look at very fundamental difficulties with existing technologies and try to demonstrate prototype solutions. That is what we have done in this case. The results have shown that we have a technology that could be used to make a rechargeable battery (Figure 5 ), but there is still a lot to do to make a sizeable and practical pouch cell. Such cells have much more material and electrode surface in a lighter package but developing that is far beyond our current reach. \"Shell does not pretend to be able to mass- produce batteries. Others will have to progress this work, but this is not the construction industry, which requires sulphur concrete to last many decades. It took more than 15 years for Thiocrete technology to be adopted, but, given the urgent need for better batteries, companies with a 'Silicon Valley mentality' may be willing to accelerate the development of our invention. That could bring the technology to maturity in time to have an impact.\" A suite of patents Having shown that their ideas had merit, Guy, Indranil and the PTG/e collaborators filed patent Lithium anodeAluminium cathodeDischarge e- Li(-)Li+ AI(+)Li+Li+e- Li+ FIGURE 5 Simulations performed at STCB indicated that organosilane polymers can be split and grafted onto aluminium, thus creating the potential for a novel battery technology that eliminates the presence of troublesome polysulphides.FIGURE 6 STCB simulation showing how divalent magnesium (green) would bond between two halves of a TESPT molecule. 11 Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021applications. One application (PCT/EP2019/ 068993) claims a process for preparing similar polymers but containing more sulphur. Guy believes this might be valuable: \"The compounds we used for the proof of concept contained only small sulphur bridges. Increasing the sulphur content would improve battery performance, but there is a limit to the length of the bridge. More than eight sulphur atoms prefer to be in a crown shape, and that would bring back all the difficulties of the shuttle mechanism. Instead, we found a way of adding sulphur by including more branched organics to bind them and included this aspect in the application.\" The other two patent applications claim battery technologies that use sulphur-containing organosilane polymers, with and without additional elemental sulphur, as cathode materials. One (PCT/EP2018/069903) cites lithium as an anode material, but, anticipating that the element might become scarce, the inventors included other monovalent metals, such as sodium or potassium, as potential anodes. Patent application PCT/EP2020/051327 claims the use of the same cathode technology combined with a divalent metal, such as magnesium or calcium, that binds to two sulphur ions and could potentially double the volumetric energy density. This approach has the additional potential advantage that the two halves of the \"sulphur bridge\" in the molecule would remain in close proximity and have a high probability of reuniting during charging ( Figure 6 ). This could result in the battery retaining its capacity over many more cycles. Shell already has an extremely large patent base that covers aspects of sulphur chemistry developed to answer the needs of its oil and gas businesses. It is Guy and Indranil's hope that, if granted, the new patents will form the basis of a new Shell patent portfolio that could help to drive the energy transition.

VALIDATING AN ALTERNATIVE openhole sand-control method Brunei Shell Petroleum (BSP) has vast experience in the management of sand from production wells, in particular sand exclusion downhole achieved by installing fit-for-purpose sand-control completions. However, recent experience has been pushing BSP from conventional gravel packs towards more expensive alternatives. The BSP well completions engineering team therefore worked with Shell's applied well technology (AWT) team to investigate Baker Hughes' GeoFORM technology for mitigating packing risks, improving safety and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Background Most of the sand formations in wells developed by BSP are unconsolidated, poorly sorted and heterogeneous, and have high fines and clay contents. Openhole completions are generally preferred, as they provide longevity, a higher productivity index and about a 15% lower well cost compared with cased-hole completions. BSP has almost equal numbers of openhole standalone screen (OHSAS), openhole gravel-pack (OHGP) and downhole sand-control completions in its portfolio. Figure 1 shows the openhole lengths and deviations for OHGP jobs recently carried out in BSP. A large proportion of wells had openhole lengths shorter than 200 m and the deviations varied uniformly between 0 and 90\u00b0. Uphill fishhook gravel-pack jobs were carried out with deviations of between 90 and 120\u00b0. Studies showed that the OHGP failure rate was less than half that for OHSAS completions. The most common reason for the failure of OHGP completions, across well lives, was found to be incomplete packs. These were caused by one or a combination of: wellbore instability during gravel-pack circulation; mobile and unstable clay and shale causing bridging during gravel packing; the presence of washouts: low-velocity regions in the open hole that cause slurry dehydration when pumping the gravel pack; formation-fluid incompatibility; narrow fracturing margins resulting in premature screenout owing to formation fracture; screen plugging during deployment or while pumping the gravel pack or due to wrong screen mesh selection; or tight openhole clearance and higher circulation pressures. On average, about eight OHGPs per year are carried out in BSP. A review of the execution performance of the last 30 OHGPs showed that 8 of 30 wells had a pack efficiency less than 62%. Gravel packing carried out using alternate-path shunt screens showed good results: 9 out of 10 jobs achieved better than 90% pack efficiency. Although this is a reliable alternative for achieving good pack efficiency in the complex sand formations BSP experiences, it comes with an additional high cost premium. Proposed solution BSP's well completions engineering team identified GeoFORM technology from Baker Hughes as a possible alternative solution in selected wells. This is a patented sand-management system in which a shape-memory polymer material is compacted onto a mesh shroud screen that has an internal base pipe, similar to a conventional sand screen. In openhole completions, the GeoFORM polymer expands after coming into contact with an activation fluid, thus filling the annular space, contacting the sandface and preventing sand production without pumping an annular pack. The system also provides a positive stress against the sandface, thereby stabilising the near-wellbore FIGURE 1 Openhole lengths (a) and deviations (b) in OHGP jobs.UPSTREAM 00 200 400 600 800 1,000 1,200 1,400 1,600 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 3,000 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 3,000Completion, true vertical depth subsea (m)Openhole length (m) Openhole deviation (\u00b0)Completion, true vertical (m)a b Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021 12TABLE 1 Qualification tests. region, preventing shale migration and providing effective sand control. The technology eliminates a few of the risks associated with incomplete packs, such as higher circulation pressures, narrow fracturing margins, mobile clay, bridging and wellbore instability, as it fully excludes pumping activities. It also eliminates the risk of wrong screen mesh selection, as it is designed to handle a wide particle size distribution range. This is achieved without the customisation on the basis of the individual formation samples that is required in conventional OHSAS and OHGP methods. A preliminary cost comparison between the alternate-path gravel-pack technique and GeoFORM technology indicated that it could be economically attractive for openhole lengths of less than 280 m. Therefore, BSP decided to validate GeoFORM technology for deployment in selected wells as an alternative to an OHGP. Validating the technology Preliminary qualification testing of GeoFORM technology was conducted by the Shell AWT team at Baker Hughes' facilities in Houston, USA. BSP is currently performing qualification tests for sand retention, fluid compatibility and return permeability. These involve using GeoFORM technology in trials replicating typical well completion strategies in BSP (Table 1 ). The deliverable of this testing is to validate GeoFORM technology's ability to reduce or eliminate sand production when compared with a gravel pack and a standalone screen. Sand-retention testing A defining characteristic of the reservoirs in BSP's West Asset is the presence of unconsolidated sand formations with high fines content (Table 2 ). The AWT team recommended using actual and reconstructed (synthetic) core materials for sand-retention comparisons; however, the Brunei government imposes restrictions on taking core samples out of the country, so another solution was required. The team identified a Trinidad Grenadier Formation core that was a close match to the West Asset particle size distribution and readily available to the Houston laboratory ( Table 3 ). This core was therefore chosen for benchmarking the GeoFORM technology's performance.

A 1-in.-thick GeoFORM coupon with a 0.42-in. (25-g) layer of formation sand was introduced to the test apparatus and brought to bottomhole temperature ( Figure 2 ). Heated viscous oil was then made to flow through the apparatus and the produced solids in the effluent were collected for analysis. After flow was established at a drawdown of 50 psi, the piston was then used to apply varying forces to the formation and GeoFORM samples to mimic high compaction strains. Sand-retention test results The industry acceptance criterion for solids collected for standalone screens is less than 0.12 lb/ft2 at a flow of 3 gal/ft2. However, the low weight of solids collected in the first three samples enabled the testing volume to be reduced to 1.8 gal/ft2 to complete the test in a day. The total solids include the additional formation material collected during the application of force to the pack and the GeoFORM sample; however, the total amount still passes the industry acceptance criterion. The results were similar for the actual and the synthetic samples. These results also proved that the synthetic cores produced by the AWT team were representative of the actual cores. A 40/60 gravel-pack coupon was also used as a test control. The GeoFORM technology's performance was comparable to that of an OHGP ( Figure 3 ). Fluid-compatibility testing The reservoir sections of the BSP wells that are candidates for GeoFORM technology will likely be drilled using a synthetic-oil-base mud and then displaced to a water-base completion brine or mud to change from a nonaqueous to an aqueous medium. When the lower completion has been installed in the open hole, the activation fluid and delayed filter-cake breaker will be circulated through a brine carrier to expand the GeoFORM polymer and remove the filter cake. The activation fluid needs to expand the GeoFORM polymer fully to the open hole before the breaker removes the filter cake, as, when the well is on losses, the activation fluid will no longer be present. Another option is to spot mix synthetic- oil-base drilling mud with activation fluid and enable the filter cake to be lifted off later through the GeoFORM polymer during well activation. To validate the technology for various fluid types, further tests will be carried out (see Table 1 ). At the time of writing, only the expansion in brine had been performed; no issues were identified. TABLE 3 Particle size distributions of actual and synthetic Grenadier core samples.

Expansion and activator-compatibility test results A GeoFORM coupon was tested in a 12.24-kPa/m (10.42-lb/gal) sodium bromide-potassium chloride brine at bottomhole temperature using four different concentrations of the activation fluid, acetyl acetone. The results showed no signs of incompatibility between the brine and the activation fluid. The test also measured the GeoFORM polymer's expansion rate against the acetyl acetone concentration ( Figure 4 ). At 5-6% acetyl acetone concentration, the polymer expanded to the 8.5-in. gauge hole in approximately 15 h, whereas with a 7 -8% acetyl acetone solution the polymer expanded to the same gauge hole in about 7 h. Cost comparison A cost analysis among the three alternate types of openhole sand-control systems versus screen length was done to benchmark the commercial attractiveness of GeoFORM technology. This was done by interpolating from vendor quotations for a 300-m openhole completion and then varying the screen length only ( Figure 5 ). The accuracy of these estimates may vary for different well lengths owing to negotiation, rig time, gravel-pack fluid and service personnel requirements. Conclusion The value of this technology to BSP is considerable, as it is expected to provide better longevity than OHSAS, is appropriate for a wide variety of BSP sand formations with varying particle size distributions and mitigates the incomplete packing risk associated with OHGP. This conformable sand-management system can, if fully qualified, be deployed as an alternative to OHGP in selected wells, as current issues with packing efficiency in conventional gravel packs are pushing BSP towards expensive alternate-path technology for most wells. The GeoFORM technology also eliminates many of the health and safety exposure risks and logistical constraints associated with managing the pumping operation and storing equipment and fluids for the conventional gravel-pack method. The operation needs minimal employee involvement compared with OHGP, thus minimising personnel exposure. It is expected that hazards from lifting operations, chemical handling, line of fire, slips and trips, and hand and finger injuries will be reduced with GeoFORM technology compared with OHGP. Switching from OHGP to GeoFORM technology will also minimise greenhouse gas emissions from pumping activities. There is the risk that the activation fluid and filter-cake breaker will be incompatible if pumped in the same treatment, or that a delayed FIGURE 4 Expansion test results. 7. 0 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 557. 58.08.59.09.510.010.5Expansion (in.)

If this is the case, there is still the option of pumping the activation fluid after the lower completion has been installed, waiting the required time for GeoFORM polymer expansion (7 -15 h) and then coming back with coiled tubing into the lower completion to pump the filter-cake breaker or trying to lift off the filter cake with drawdown. At present, several hydrocarbon maturation projects are considering GeoFORM technology as a potential sand-control method. Following successful validation tests, technology deployment in a selected well is expected by 2023.Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank Bart Waltman, senior completion and well interventions engineer, and William Gusler, staff production technologist, both at AWT, for their great support in planning and co-ordinating the testing activities at the Baker Hughes laboratory; Nur Izzah Yaakub, senior production chemist, BSP, for support in providing the chemicals and drilling fluids required to facilitate the testing activities in Brunei and Houston; Norliny Talib, senior production technologist and subject matter expert in sand control, BSP, for support in selecting the appropriate sample for GeoFORM testing; and Walrick van Zandvoord, head of production technology, West Asset, for reviewing the technology testing plan and identifying potential candidates for deployment.

However, their value and processing route strongly depend on their purity, for example, their asphaltene and gum contents and levels of heavy metals such as mercury. In recent years, several novel separation technologies have successfully been scouted for removing typical \"nasty\" components such as asphaltenes and mercury with a keen focus on sustainability through techniques with minimal energy requirements, and thus low carbon footprints, and low waste impacts. Both solvent-resistant nanofiltration and enhanced adsorption processes are areas in which Shell has been applying its expertise. Nanofiltration There are many cost-advantageous feedstocks available that contamination often makes undesirable. Contaminants such as asphaltenes and/or other fouling precursors give rise to issues in storage and in refining or chemical production (steam crackers). In particular, fouling during refining negatively affects heat transfer and, thus, the carbon footprint of the processing route. Typical fouling issues are related to the presence of fine particulates, asphaltenes, ash components and other fouling precursors. The removal of these species is not achievable using conventional filtration technology, which is either not selective enough or prone to irreversible fouling effects. One option for mitigating these issues is to use enhanced filtration technologies such as nanofiltration through dense, nonfouling polymeric membranes. These membranes are specifically designed for use with organics solvents and hydrocarbons. The potential of siloxane-based membranes for upgrading black condensates to cost-advantaged feedstock for ethylene crackers has been successfully demonstrated in several test campaigns. A dedicated patent portfolio has been developed to protect Shell's knowledge position in this area [Ref 1, 2] . In addition, significant improvements to the development were implemented to enhance the robustness to fouling of the membrane separation mechanism [Ref 3] . In 2012, technology for even more challenging feedstocks, such as typical shale oils, was successfully scouted and a patent application was filed [Ref 4] . These are attractive feedstocks owing to their higher obtainable margins, but they are notorious for fouling issues during processing. The results of the demonstration trials were excellent: a light permeate product was obtained (up to >90%). Such nanofiltration separation can significantly enhance refining processing routes and help to mitigate their carbon footprints. The membrane material used is dense. Consequently, its transport mechanism is based on solubility and diffusivity and driven by trans-membrane pressure. Under the right hydrodynamic conditions, this makes the membranes robust to fouling, as there are no pores to block or plug. Nevertheless, a prefiltration system is normally applied to remove coarse debris. To enhance robustness and mitigate operational interventions, a self-cleaning filtration system such as the Filtrex ACR is preferable. Mercury removal Condensates are significant coproducts during natural gas production. However, many ageing gas fields produce ever more natural gas condensate with an ever higher mercury content. These condensates are marketed at substantial discounts. Mercury removal often relies on bulk adsorption processes that are costly and significantly labour intensive. In 2008, Shell Projects & Technology developed membrane filtration technology for removing mercury from high mercury condensates [Ref 5] . Further upscaling was done in close collaboration with BORSIG Membrane Technology, a German supplier of leading and innovative membrane technology solutions. BORSIG's engineering competence combined with the membrane production skills of its subsidiary GMT Membrantechnik GmbH facilitated customised development and high-quality membrane units. These technologies have been successfully applied at a Shell refinery for organic solvent nanofiltration and for vapour recovery systems at tank farms. In 2011, this technology was successfully demonstrated at a natural gas production plant using a specially designed test facility ( Figure 1 ) connected to a feed tank. Here, the elemental FIGURE 1 The single-module nanofiltration test facility on-site.UPSTREAM 17 Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021 mercury content of the condensate was lowered from above 1,000 ppb to less than 25 ppb, the detection limit of the analytical method used (detection method UOP-938-00 on a Lumex RA-915M spectrometer trial, GMT and BORSIG collaborated to develop and deliver a commercial- size, 8-in., spiral-wound membrane module and to design and built a test skid. As the membrane material is hydrophobic, the presence of free water in the natural gas condensate results in a flux decline. However, this phenomenon is reversible if a significant crossflow velocity (0.5-1 m/s) is maintained over the membrane surface area. Figure 2 shows the separation method. The permeate material was obtained at a recovery rate of 30%. For a commercial system, it is envisioned that the feed tank will also act as a settling tank for the mercury in the retentate. In this way, high condensate recovery is achievable with a skid operating at about 30% recovery per pass. When combined with an enhanced settling process or filtration, almost 100% condensate recovery can be obtained. Enhanced adsorption methods Not all application cases justify the investment in a dedicated nanofiltration unit. In many cases, such as for mercury removal, adsorption systems are still being applied. To mitigate the pressure differential over these adsorption beds, relatively coarse adsorption materials (pellets) are used. For mercury applications, these may be activated-carbon or sulphur-impregnated pellets. As adsorption effectively only takes place on the outside of the pellets, these systems are relatively bulky. In addition, they may rapidly lose efficiency when used with more heavily contaminated condensates; this is mainly related to the presence of asphaltenes and/ or so-called schmoo (essentially, oil-coated particulates). Consequently, more frequent changeout of the adsorbent material is required, which creates excessive waste and higher health, safety and environmental risk exposure. Reducing the pellets' size to increase the area for adsorption is not possible because of pressure drop constraints. However, a finer adsorption material (powder), for example, granulates in the size range 5-10 \u00b5m, can be effective in combination with a filter medium. These are known as precoat filtration systems. The advantage is that the finer granule structure increases the adsorption surface area. In addition, by dosing the fine adsorption material in combination with continuous filtration (frequent removal of the filter cake), the system is less prone to adsorbent fouling effects. However, this requires significant solids handling and cake removal. In addition, fairly thick cake layers are required for reliable removal. To overcome these issues, self-cleaning filtration has significant potential. With an adsorbent dosage and mixing system, for example, in-line mixing, a fairly small amount of adsorbent material can be used. For mercury concentrations in the range 1,000 to 2,000 ppb, a 5-\u00b5m powder adsorbent would be mixed in at a concentration of 100 ppm or lower. However, such a system will need optimising for the specific conditions, especially with respect to solids concentration and residence time. After FIGURE 2 The separation principle.

To determine the effectiveness of this line-up, laboratory testing was performed using mercury-contaminated condensate. By adding activated carbon and filtering through a 5-\u00b5m filter, the mercury content was reduced from 1,600 to less than 10 ppb. The basis of these tests was translated into a potential concept, as shown in Figure 3 . The advantages lie in the more compact adsorption line-up and no pressure differential restrictions, unlike for adsorption beds. The applied filtration surface area in these self-cleaning filter systems ensures a relatively low filtration velocity (<9 m/min). This prevents the adsorbed material (mercury) from leaching out. Another key aspect of self-cleaning filtration is its minimal backwash waste. Self-cleaning filtration for mercury during decontamination where mercury is present in solids (mercury sulphide) has been applied at the Den Helder gas and condensate receiving plant in the Netherlands [Ref 5] . For these adsorption methods, applications for correcting off-specification liquids are foreseen, for example, the removal of undesired oxygenates from solvents. The compactness of the total line-up (a skid-mounted option) could mean mobile treatment units that could be deployed wherever needed in the event an off-specification situation, for example, treating cargos during tanker unloading. Adsorbent mixed in along the pipe length during unloading would provide sufficient residence time for adsorption.

The characteristics of the simultaneous flow of the immiscible phases can be quantified using relative permeability relations. In geoscience applications, these relations are determined in coreflooding studies that often comprise coreflood tests of oil-water mixtures performed on centimetre-scale rock samples. The outcomes of these are subject to uncertainty, which ultimately influences how accurately the parameters from small-scale tests translate to the upscaled estimations. To assess this uncertainty, Shell researchers have developed an inverse modelling workflow for the uncertainty analysis of relative permeability functions derived from coreflood tests. The results suggest that, even at a small scale, the uncertainty can be significant. Corefloods Multiphase flow is prevalent in many natural phenomena and a wide range of processing technologies, from papermaking to fuel cells, involve it in some form. In the oil and gas industries, multiphase flow often implies the simultaneous flow of oil, water and gas. Understanding such flow is important for predicting reservoir flow and hydrocarbon production. Managing uncertainty is key to delivering Upstream projects within the estimated recovery range and closer to the cost estimate. Special core analysis (SCAL) studies play an important role in determining FIGURE 1 Inverse modelling workflow to assess uncertainties in relative permeability.

Therefore, the analysis of uncertainty should start with the interpretation of laboratory SCAL measurements. SCAL experiments seek values for petrophysical parameters, such as the porosity of the reservoir, and flow parameters, such as permeability. Essential to SCAL are coreflood tests. In these, a fluid or combination of fluids is injected into a sample of rock to measure its permeability, the relative permeability of the injected fluids, the saturation distribution and the interactions between the fluid and the rock. The core material often comes from an oil reservoir, but some tests use outcrop rock. The fluid in place at the start of the test is typically either a simulated formation brine, crude or refined oil, or a combination of brine and oil. Injected fluids may include crude oil, simulated reservoir brine, refined fluids, drilling mud filtrate, acids, foam or other chemicals used in the oil field. Depending on the purpose of the test, the conditions may be either ambient temperature and low confining pressure or the high temperature and pressure of a subject reservoir. Pressures and flow rates at both ends of the core are measured. A coreflood is typically used to determine the optimum development option for an oil reservoir and often helps to evaluate the effect of injecting fluids specially designed to improve or enhance oil recovery. Shell's best practices in SCAL require that (1) coreflood experiments be conducted with restored-wettability cylindrical rock samples taken from cores and (2) the measured pressure drop, production data and saturation profiles be interpreted with the aid of numerical models that also take the (independently measured) capillary pressure into consideration. In the past, the match between the modelled data and the experimental data from the second step was achieved by manually varying the relative permeability value. This ultimately gave a best-fit relative permeability value, but it did not provide its associated uncertainty, at least not in a representative way. Uncertainty assessment workflow This workflow described here can systematically assess the uncertainty of the relative permeability derived from assisted history matching of coreflood experiments. In the workflow ( Figure 1 ), coreflood experiments are interpreted with the aid of a two-phase Darcy flow model that numerically simulates the experiment. A match between the measured values and the model parameters is achieved using the Python optimisation toolbox, which uses gradient-based methods to find a minimum of the mismatch between measured and modelled values expressed by the 2 function, which is the sum of the squared differences. Hyperplanes through the multidimensional parameter space reveal the nonuniqueness of the solution and whether the inverse model-matching converges to the global minimum. Respective error ranges for all the parameters in the relative permeability model can then be obtained from the covariance matrix of the 2 fit with respect to the local optimum and, more globally, from Markov chain or Monte Carlo methods. Darcy's law and multiphase flow The flow of a fluid in a porous medium is macroscopically described using Darcy's law, which relates the flux to the pressure gradient. Specifically, the law states that the flux, v , is inversely proportional to the viscosity of the fluid, \u00b5, and the constant of proportionality, k , is the permeability of the porous medium: [Eq 1] For describing multiphase flows, Darcy's law is extended with the introduction of two phenomenological parameters that are FIGURE 2 Darcy's law for single-phase flow and its phenomenological extension to two-phase flow. 21 Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0 0 0.2 Saturation0.4 0.6 1 0.8Relative permeability 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0 -0.2 -0.4 0 0.2 Saturation0.4 0.6 kr,o imbibition1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 06 5 4 3 2 1 0 0 0.5 Pore volume injectedVarying all six relative permeability parameters 2 1.5 1Production (pore volume)Pressure drop 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0 0 0.2 Saturation0.4 0.6 1 0.8Relative permeability1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 06 5 4 3 2 1 0 0 0.5 Pore volume injectedConstraining = 0.1 and = 0.2 S(w,c) S(o,r) 2 1.5 1Production (pore volume)Pressure drop 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0 0 0.2 Saturation0.4 0.6 1 0.8Relative permeabilitykr,w (ref) CERTAINTY IN UNCERTAINTY: Q UANTIFYING COREFLOOD DATA ERRORS considered as functions of saturation: relative permeability, kr,, and capillary pressure, pc(Sw), such that [Eq 2] where is the phase (wetting or nonwetting). These parameters cannot be predicted within the framework of two-phase Darcy flow; they need to be derived empirically (or computed using digital rock methods) ( Figure 2 ).Indeed, coreflood experiments are routinely used to determine relative permeability functions [Ref 1, 2] . Although the most common experiments involve the so-called unsteady-state method, the Shell -recommended practice is to use the steady- state method. Both types of experiments are discussed here; the unsteady-state method is somewhat more illuminating, however, and it will be used to demonstrate the workflow, from conducting the experiment, to interpreting the results and, finally, deriving the relative permeability ( Figure 3 ). Many analytical approaches exist to interpret these experiments, but they all ignore capillary effects, which can significantly influence the resulting relative permeability. The Shell- recommended practice is to use numerical FIGURE 4 Nonuniqueness of the relative permeability derived from an unsteady-state experiment using synthetic data.FIGURE 3 Workflow for deriving the relative permeability functions for the wetting (blue) and nonwetting (red) phases.

The data from the experiment (pressure-drop and production data for an unsteady-state experiment) are therefore matched against the numerical simulation by varying the relative permeability curves. Figure 3 shows a high-level representation of the assisted-history-matching workflow in which experimental data are matched to the numerical solution of the governing equations (the two-phase extension of Darcy's law) so that the relative permeability functions for the wetting and nonwetting phases can be derived. How unique is the match? The big question is, what is the uncertainty of the relative permeability curves? Before that question can be addressed, it is necessary to understand whether the match obtained in the workflow outlined in Figure 3 is, in fact, unique. To address this question, it is necessary to go beyond the workflow of manual matching, as depicted in Figure 3 , and to automate the matching of the model to the experimental data. To this end, the curve_fit and lmfit functions from the Python optimisation toolbox are used. Both of these are based on the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (which is a gradient-based 2 minimisation method) and coupled with a numerical flow simulator that computes the numerical solution of the two-phase, 1D Darcy equations with capillarity.

The last turned out to be the main tool used in the study, because it captures all the essential flow physics and is a factor of 400 faster than calling Dynamo/MoReS via the wrapper. When testing the workflow on a synthetic data set, it became apparent that, even in the simplest case of a 1D unsteady-state displacement with pc = 0, the ground truth is not automatically recovered. Figure 4 shows the known, ground- truth production curve, pressure drop and relative permeability (labelled as \"ref\") plotted as broken lines. Without applying any constraints, that is, varying all six parameters of the Corey function used to represent relative permeability, even in the most idealised situation (i.e., data without any noise), the ground-truth relative permeability is not recovered, even though the matches with the production and pressure drop curves are almost perfect ( Figures 4(a) and (b) ). However, when constraints for connate water S(w,c) and residual oil saturation S(o,r) are applied, the ground truth is recovered ( Figures 4(c) and (d)). Thus, even though the match in terms of production curve and pressure drop is practically indistinguishable from the ground-truth data, the relative permeability of the match is not the ground truth. That is a clear sign of nonuniqueness. The same behaviour is observed for the inverse matching of an experimental data set from an unsteady-state experiment in which multiple 2 minima can be seen. Light colours represent large values of 2 and dark colours small values (Figure 5(a) ). The 2 parameter space exhibits multiple minima, which a 3D contour plot of the 2 landscape for a three-parameter match shows (Figure 5(b) ). This problem is one reason why Shell does not recommend using unsteady-state corefloods to determine relative permeability, and especially not at only one fixed rate. SCAL experts have known this for many years, which is why they have relied on additional data to constrain the solution. Choice of input and flow model After assessing the fundamental problems of interpreting coreflood experiments by means of inverse modelling [Ref 1, 2] , the team went on to demonstrate that a match can be sufficiently constrained with the right choice of data and the right relative permeability model. As an example, the team used a steady-state relative permeability experimental data set that is part of Shell's internal SCAL training course. The data set comes from a constant flow rate experiment with varying fractional flow, fw, and a so-called \"bump flood\" at the end, when the flow rate is increased in two steps. This can be clearly seen as the increase in pressure drop at the end of the experiment from about 170 h onwards (Figure 6(a) ). 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 25 Time (h)50 75 150 175 100 125 (bar) /uni0394p 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0 0 0.2 Saturation0.4 0.6 1 0.8Relative permeability2.0 1.5 1 0.5 0 0.2 Saturation0.4 0.6 1 0.8Capillary pressure (bar)0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 Position x (cm)Saturation 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 1fw=1.0 + bump flood fw=1.0 fw=0.0Capillary end effect 0.8Match Data manual match kr,w match kr,o matcha c db FIGURE 6 Experimental data from a steady-state coreflood experiment. Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021 24In the experiment, for a series of flow, fw, values, the pressure drop ( Figure 6(a) and saturation profiles ( Figure 6(b) ) are matched using the LET model of relative permeability. The resulting relative permeability curves are shown in Figure 6(c) , which also plots the results of the manual match. The automated match also includes the independently measured capillary pressure function, pc(Sw), which was parameterised with an analytical function, as shown in Figure 6(d) . In the match, all the parameters were allowed to vary, including S(w,c) and S(o,r). The experimental data, including the bump flood and saturation profiles Sw(x), constrained the match sufficiently well that consistency with S(o,r) from the capillary pressure data was achieved. The model matches both the pressure drop and the saturation profiles reasonably well at about the same level of quality that a SCAL expert can achieve with manual matching. In Figure 7 , the uncertainty associated with the relative permeability curves of the manual match is compared with that of the automated match. The uncertainty was assessed with a Markov chain-Monte Carlo approach [Ref 1, 2] . When the tabulated relative permeability values obtained from the manual match were fitted to a LET model, the resulting uncertainty ranges were of about the same magnitude as the experimental uncertainty-based error bars ( Figures 7(a) and (b) ). The automated match, in which the flow model is matched directly to the whole pressure drop and saturation profile data set, results in different relative permeability curves ( Figures 7(c) and (d)) with significantly less uncertainty. The reason is that, in the fit of the tabulated data, only 14 individual data points were available to constrain the match and there were significant correlations between the fit parameters, all of which led to significant errors in the individual parameters of the relative permeability model. In contrast, when the model is directly matched to the experimental data, S(o,r) is very well constrained (particularly by the bump floods), thereby effectively decoupling the water and oil relative permeability parameterisations and resulting in much lower uncertainty. One last point to note is that the manual-match and the automated-match curves differ in terms of endpoints, crossover points and shape. These differences in relative permeability would have implications in practice. What next? The workflow presented in this article provides evidence that it is feasible to history match coreflood experiments by coupling numerical flow simulators with optimisation methods. Using Python provides a convenient platform for rapid prototyping without needing a software licence. This software is freely available, and its optimisation toolbox provides methods sufficiently well suited to achieving assisted matches of models with at least 10 parameters. Despite Python being predominantly interpreted code, the use of the Numba just-in-time compiler has made the code significantly faster.

This made the code fast enough to run a full Markov chain- Monte Carlo model with 10 parameters using 20,000 iterations in an acceptable time, even on a laptop computer. This opens the door to the further refinement of the team's approach. Before optimising the code further, however, the study team plans to extend the interpretation methodology to centrifuge experiments used for the independent measurement of the capillary pressure, pc(Sw), and to match the raw data from centrifuge and steady-state experiments simultaneously. Although the LET relative permeability model does provide a satisfactory match, the residuals show a systematic non-Gaussian distribution and are significantly larger than the experimental error. Possible reasons for this are shortcomings in either the flow model or the relative permeability parameterisation. Alternatively, there may be an unexplained phenomenon at play in the experimental data. These aspects will be investigated in future research.

Now, this low-energy technology is finding potential applications in the separations necessary for processing alternative and renewable feedstocks and achieving a circular carbochemical industry. This will help Shell to achieve its goal of net-zero carbon dioxide emissions. Background In the early 21st century, there was ever-decreasing access to easy oil and gas, which led to an increasing switch to unconventionals such as shale and light tight oil. In the case of gas production, this led to higher availability of discounted dark or black condensates. However, the processing of these novel feedstocks often gives rise to fouling issues in refineries and chemical plants that significantly affect the emission footprints of processing units. Typical fouling issues are related to the presence of fine particulates, asphaltenes, ash and other problematic components. The removal of these species is not achievable using conventional filtration technologies, which are either not selective enough or prone to irreversible fouling effects. One of the options to mitigate these issues is to use enhanced filtration technologies such as nanofiltration utilising dense, nonfouling polymeric membranes. As early as 2004, the potential of silicon-based membranes for upgrading black condensates to cost-advantaged feedstocks for ethylene crackers was successfully demonstrated in several test campaigns. Subsequently, a dedicated patent portfolio was developed in this area [Ref 1, 2] . The ability to remove problematic foulants by a sustainable separation method was a challenge for which nanofiltration proved to be successful. Through this demanding application, Shell has proven the route for removing the typical molecules and contaminants responsible for the fouling of processing units by means of solvent- robust nanofiltration. With the objective of reducing the carbon footprint of processing and refining facilities, the advantages of this separation method are twofold. First, nanofiltration is a sustainable separation method that runs with an electric energy source for powering a feed pump and, if required, a recycle pump. Second, the emergence of new energy sources, including renewable feed materials or those related to circularity such as pyrolysis oils, recovered solvents and waste oils, make these separation methods even more important. As Shell desires to achieve wider applications in these areas, the application of solvent-robust nanofiltration will be an important facilitator that can significantly contribute to carbon dioxide emission reductions for refineries, the circularity of the industry and the processing of these alternative feedstocks. Testing on shale oil To demonstrate the robustness of nanofiltration technology, its application in ICP shale-oil processing provides a relevant fouling abatement test case FIGURE 1 Typical ICP shale-oil feedstock. FIGURE 3 Set of typical samples from the ICP shale-oil trial.FIGURE 2 Test unit installed in the field.UPSTREAM Sludge sample Free water Solid black layer 27 Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021of a worst-case feed material (Figure 1). As shown by Alcor testing, ICP shale-oil fouling behaviour is significant and fouling mitigation of such feed materials is unachievable using conventional filtration techniques. The retention of sulphur and nitrogen, as well as asphaltenes, carbon and metals species, was also verified. In contrast to conventional filtration processes, the dense nanofiltration membrane did not suffer from irreversible fouling because there was no pore plugging. This has resulted in a patent [Ref 3] . The technology was de-risked in 2010 by field-testing. The goals of this were to demonstrate the robustness and fouling resistance of the membrane material and the membrane module. Therefore, a semicommercial module was used in a dedicated pilot unit ( Figure 2 ). This module was provided by BORSIG Membrane Technology GmbH and GMT Membrantechnik GmbH. It consisted of a specific spiral-wound element containing a novel, more open feed spacer to reduce membrane-module-related fouling; this was based on an in-house Shell development [Ref 4] . The results of the trial were excellent. A light permeate product was obtained at a high recovery, in some cases >90%. Feed, permeate and retentate samples at 50% recovery are shown in Figure 3 . Although after use at >90% recovery the membrane module appeared heavily fouled (Figure 4 ), hardly any effect on the flux behaviour of the membrane or pressure drop (feed to retentate) over the membrane element was observed. This demonstrates both the low fouling tendency of the membrane material due to the absence of pores and the robustness to particulate fouling of the spacer material. Two distinct types of analyses were performed on the material produced. The true boiling point curve in Figure 5 shows the removal of the heavier (higher boiling) components from the feed. The permeate is enriched in lower boiling components while the retentate is enriched in the heavier (fouling promoting) components. The second type of analysis was an Alcor test, which is a thermally based fouling promotion test. The loss in heat transfer is measured as an indicator of the fouling behaviour of the test material. A lower Alcor reading, that is, a reduction in heat transfer, means a higher fouling tendency for the material. The results of the Alcor testing showed that the permeate material had a far lower, in fact unmeasurable, fouling tendency compared with the feed ( Figure 6 ). Problems associated with fouling of the ICP shale-oil material were, therefore, mitigated. Industrially proven technology BORSIG's technology based on these solvent- stable membranes is widely known as organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN). The OSN membranes' robustness has been proven in trials and industrial-scale operation. Over several years, Shell and BORSIG have established effective co-operation for progressing OSN applications identified and developed within Shell. The most significant result of this joint effort was the smooth commissioning of a large-scale solvent polishing system at a Shell refinery in 2017 . This unique-scale, 25-t/h OSN unit has been in stable and on-specification operation since start-up. Future applications As ICP shale oil production has been suspended, no further development for that application is being pursued. However, alternative application areas are emerging that are connected with circularity and alternative or renewable feedstocks such as pyrolysis, used cooking and spent lubricating oils, and natural gas dark condensates. 0 Recovered (wt%)10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100Boiling point (\u00b0C) 0700 600 500 400 300 200 100Mixed feed Final retentate Mixed permeateFIGURE 5 True boiling point characterisation of feed, permeate and retentate.

To broaden the field of applications, the nanofiltration method may be combined with self-cleaning filtration techniques [Ref 5] . These will enhance the robustness of the nanofiltration step by removing larger, bulk solids components (typically 10 \u00b5m). The self-cleaning filtration method is known for its small backwash consumption and, consequently, its low carbon footprint.

In September 1852, an airship containing 300 m3 of the gas covered 27 km, but its 2-kW, carbon-fuelled steam engine could not propel it upwind. Better technologies were needed. So, ever since the Wright Flyer took to the air in 1903, almost every heavier-than-air flying machine has burned a hydrocarbon fuel in an engine. Now, because of the need to decarbonise all transport sectors, aviation is again turning to hydrogen - but, crucially, for fuel not buoyancy. ZeroAvia, which has secured Shell Ventures' backing, thinks commercial aeroplanes can fly using hydrogen fuel cells and electric motors. TechXplorer spoke to Paul Bogers, vice president Shell Hydrogen; Anna Mascolo, president, Shell Aviation; and Val Miftakhov, ZeroAvia's founder and chief executive officer, to get their views on this intriguing possibility. Aviation has contributed to the world's social and economic development, but the benefits of flying come at a cost. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, commercial aviation was responsible for 2-3% of total global carbon emissions [Ref 1] . By 2050, however, these emissions could account for 8% of the total, as aviation is expected to be one of the fastest-growing transport sectors. Current options for managing the sector's impact on climate are limited. Nevertheless, Shell believes that the aviation sector can avoid, reduce and offset its emissions and thereby achieve significant improvements. Improvements in the design and operation of aircraft are expected to result in incremental reductions in carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions. But the industry's focus is firmly on introducing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Shell is committed to supporting its production and supply, for example, through its investment in LanzaJet, a leader in ethanol-to-jet-fuel technology. And it has recently demonstrated the potential for making jet fuel based on renewable electricity and CO 2 capture. Burn or turn? Replacing conventional jet fuel by SAF made from renewable biomass or recycled CO 2 could, if used unblended, potentially deliver an up to 80% reduction in life-cycle CO 2 emissions. However, even if SAF replaced all fossil-fuel-derived jet fuels, the products of burning fuel at high altitudes would remain, and these largely drive the rise in global temperature. Recognising that SAF is not a complete solution, the industry is turning to hydrogen. ad VENTURE The Giffard dirigible showed the potential of hydrogen to enable powered flight - despite the gas's proximity to the coke-fired steam engine driving a crude propeller. Image courtesy of the Fondo Antiguo at the University of Seville, Spain. Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021 30Shell is not alone in anticipating that hydrogen will have a role as an aviation fuel. Airbus has revealed three concept aircraft powered by hydrogen combustion that could enter service by 2035. ZeroAvia, however, has focused on the development of hydrogen-electric propulsion for propeller-driven aircraft. Demand and supply In any case, to drive the uptake of hydrogen as an aviation fuel, its price will have to be competitive with jet fuel. And the zero-emission production of hydrogen requires some infrastructure, regardless of its \"colour\". Green hydrogen, which is generated from the electrolysis of water, requires a renewable-power grid. And blue hydrogen, which is manufactured using the steam methane reforming process, necessitates carbon capture and storage facilities. Shell therefore continues to explore when and how hydrogen might be offered to aviation customers. Against this backdrop, Paul describes the forces shaping hydrogen supply chains. \"We get many questions about how Shell Hydrogen is working to decarbonise those sectors that are hard to electrify, and aviation is a great example. In this and other sectors, we see hydrogen as part of a mosaic of available options with each bringing its own challenges. Each sector will have a different journey, but we are trying to answer the same questions: how much better must hydrogen be than the alternatives to justify the investment? Which locations should we supply, in what volumes, when and at what cost? Would it be better to stick with known fuels and strive to make them lower carbon? \"To find the answers, we talk to the main aircraft manufacturers and industry bodies to help shape the industry. We also invest in companies such as ZeroAvia that are leading the way as part of a broader learning journey. Investing in a fast-moving start-up gives us exciting insights into the latest developments and is a sound alternative to paying consultants to tell us where they think the boundaries are.\"Anna concurs. \"There is no single answer to delivering net-zero emissions for the aviation sector. We need multiple solutions over varying time frames, so there is a critical opportunity for the many participants across the aviation ecosystem to align on the way forward. \"Although the industry is focusing on SAF, Shell is exploring a wide range of options with others in the industry; these include hydrogen solutions. We are assessing the feasibility of the various technologies, how and when to introduce them, where it makes sense for Shell to play a role, and how we can help to overcome operational challenges. \"Shell Ventures' investment in ZeroAvia is a collaborative relationship involving Shell Hydrogen in the aviation sector, and we hope it will facilitate introductions to new technology players. It will also help Shell Aviation to have a front-row seat as the technologies develop and to understand how fast the sector might adopt hydrogen and the opportunities for potential future investments,\" she concludes. Zero-emission flight in sight ZeroAvia has done a fair bit to accelerate the introduction of hydrogen-fuel-cell powertrains. At the time of its founding just four years ago, the prospect of making a powertrain suitable for a full-size commercial aircraft was described as \"not yet in sight\" [Ref 2] . But ZeroAvia is already on track to do just that. It achieved the first flight by a commercial-sized hydrogen-electric aircraft in September 2020 ( Figure 1 ) and is working on a 19-seat test aircraft at its new base at Cotswold Airport, UK. By 2024, it expects to have a powertrain to replace one of the most popular small turbines, one used in 80% of turboprop aircraft of up to 20-seat capacity. \"Today, the only mature technology for decarbonising aviation that works is SAF,\" Val says. \"But, if we look at the 2050 time horizon for decarbonisation, we can go to first principles and look at other technologies that are fundamentally better. Our view is that hydrogen-electric 31 Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021technologies are the best in several ways, which is why we are focusing on commercialising them. \"ZeroAvia's powertrains emit no CO 2 and take care of the non-CO 2-related, climate-forcing emissions that result from high-altitude combustion; they do not produce nitrous oxide or ozone, which are greenhouse gases, sulphur dioxide to influence solar radiation, aerosols or soot. The only emission is water.\" After CO 2 emissions, the next largest factor in aviation-related climate forcing is the creation of thin, aviation-induced cirrus clouds that form when contrails disperse. More water is produced by a hydrogen-fuel-cell powertrain than by an equivalent jet engine, but it is at a lower temperature, so contrail formation is suppressed. Aiming small ZeroAvia's test-bed aeroplane has a powertrain that is a direct replacement for the original piston engine and rated at 250 kW ( Figure 2 ). The company's first commercial unit will be a 600-kW replacement for certain variants of Pratt & Whitney's ubiquitous PT6 powerplant ( Figure 3 ). \"We have segmented the market and are going after the smaller aircraft first,\" Val continues. \"Not only can we achieve the power they need; in this segment, our unit is also more competitive on cost against traditional jet fuel. The efficiencies and power-to-weight ratios of small turbines are relatively low, and the operators of these aircraft tend to be smaller and pay more for their fuel, so we are already competitive in some locations. \"Our goal is to supply integrated drop-in units that are functionally equivalent to today's turboprop powerplants: fuel in at one end and rotation at the other. The exact approach will be different for each airframe. It is not just a question of size because, in general, our units are heavier than the stock units they will replace. We are going for airframes that Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021 32FIGURE 1 ZeroAvia achieved a breakthrough in zero-emission aviation with the first flight of a commercial-size aircraft powered by its hydrogen-fuel-cell powertrain.can take the extra weight first and plan to phase in the introduction for others that require reinforcement later,\" he concludes. A new Rolls-Royce ZeroAvia is betting that much of its initial market will be for retrofitting engines on existing aircraft. In time, it expects new aircraft types will be designed specifically for hydrogen-fuel-cell powertrains but expects this to take at least 10 years. \"We believe that increasing the size and range of hydrogen-electric aircraft just needs good engineering and smart integration at the system level,\" Val explains. \"We already know how we want to enter the next market segment of larger, 70-seat, regional aircraft and have ideas about how to move to powering 100-seat aircraft. The details for this still need to be worked out, but no new fundamental science or technology is necessary. That makes the proposition less risky for investors and easier for regulators to consider.\" Aviation regulators are, in fact, receptive to using hydrogen as aircraft fuel. It is a well-understood industrial gas that has been in use for decades; the materials science, storage and flow control technologies, and safety protocols are known. Moreover, its use as a fuel for aircraft auxiliary power units has already been evaluated by NASA, the US Federal Aviation Administration and others. \"Today, we are working with partners to make the fuel tanks. Our 19-seat test aircraft will store compressed hydrogen in external tanks using spherical pressure vessels to minimise the weight. This is possible because the aircraft will be relatively slow, so the aerodynamic penalties are acceptable,\" Val clarifies. \"Traditionally, however, the structural integration is done by the airframe manufacturers. Engines are a separate part of the supply-chain ecosystem. In the long term, we see ourselves like Rolls-Royce and other aircraft-engine manufacturers. We want to partner with all the airframe manufacturers, not compete with them.\" 33 Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021FIGURE 2 ZeroAvia has a 250-kW hydrogen-electric powertrain in a Piper M-class six-seat aircraft to qualify the components and control systems and do the initial flight testing.Onwards and upwards When it comes to getting passengers into the air, ZeroAvia has a strategy to match its technology road map. To win customers, it must convince them that large volumes of hydrogen are reliably available at their airports. So, it has a simple solution that leverages Shell's green hydrogen expertise: ZeroAvia believes the optimal way to supply hydrogen is to make it on-site. ZeroAvia has demonstrated the practicality of this approach at its Cranfield, UK, research and development facility. As questions about the economics of transporting hydrogen to airport locations remain unanswered, it has concluded that decentralised green hydrogen production is likely to be economical wherever there is commercial- scale utilisation of aircraft. Val has a vision for the company's fuel supply chain and believes that introducing hydrogen may be easier in the aviation sector than in others. \"In aviation,\" he says, \"the hydrogen supply problem fundamentally differs from that in some other transport sectors. For example, in road transport, drivers have reference points: the conventional fuel stations. Sales of hydrogen vehicles will not accelerate unless filling them up is convenient. A comprehensive supply network must exist in a region before drivers of fuel-cell vehicles are willing to criss-cross that region. We think the aviation infrastructure challenge is easier because there are far fewer locations and roll-out can be gradual and incremental. \"The 10- to 20-seat aircraft that we will retrofit first will have ranges of 500 miles (800 km), enough for Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021 34 FIGURE 3 ZeroAvia's first commercial hydrogen-electric powertrain will replace the Pratt & Whitney PT6 turboprop powerplants that are widely used in single- and twin-engined aircraft; possible airframes include the Dornier Do 228 (shown), Havilland Canada DHC-6, Pilatus PC-12 and Cessna 408 SkyCourier.95% of the routes aircraft of this size currently fly. The economics of flying regular, scheduled flights out and back from a single location can readily be demonstrated and with greater confidence than for jet aircraft because the price of electricity, and consequently green hydrogen, is relatively stable. \"Hydrogen is already becoming competitive with jet fuel on shorter out-and-return routes operated by smaller carriers. Indeed, we have signed letters of intent with operators that are going to start in this way. The model for scaling up is that, once a route is profitable, operators will make one of their frequent destinations the next hydrogen hub and fly onwards to expand further in the same way. By the time larger hydrogen-electric aircraft become available, they could have a network of refuelling locations ready to take advantage of their range.\" Far horizons ZeroAvia has a far-reaching vision: by 2035, it aims to offer powertrains for airliners with 200 or more seats and 3,000-mile (4,800-km) ranges. It expects these aircraft, which must be faster and more streamlined than regional aircraft, to use cryogenic liquid hydrogen. Stored at a temperature below -253\u00b0C, liquid hydrogen carries about twice the energy in a given volume than compressed gaseous hydrogen does. And, because liquid hydrogen can be stored at a much lower pressure, ZeroAvia believes it will be feasible to design larger aircraft with liquid hydrogen storage in their wings. It expects to be able to power such aircraft in the next 20-30 years. Val concludes by summing up how Shell is helping it to support, shape and deliver its long-term vision of electrifying the aviation sector and alludes to a cross-sectoral opportunity that could benefit both parties. \"Our alignment with Shell is very valuable during conversations with potential customers because the first questions they ask are about supply. We can say that we have the support of the largest supplier of aviation fuels, one that understands the aviation market and operates one of the most extensive refuelling networks in the world. That alone signals that we have a good infrastructure plan, but Shell is also respected for its understanding of the industrial uses of hydrogen and thought leadership relating to green hydrogen. \"Shell's investment in ZeroAvia is also strategically important; we meet regularly with Shell's aviation, hydrogen, e-mobility and aircraft teams,\" he continues. \"ZeroAvia values their insights into how to respond to the regulatory environment and how to solve infrastructure problems. We think that the opportunity for introducing hydrogen as an aviation fuel can be framed differently from those for other transport sectors, but our expertise may nonetheless be relevant to supplying hydrogen for road transport as well. \"The airports from which ZeroAvia is likely to operate have good access to national road networks. So, if we have airport production hubs making hundreds of tonnes of green hydrogen a day for aviation, why not have offtakes for trucks and other road users? We think that is a very interesting possibility that could strengthen our proposition, and we are interested in working with Shell to evaluate its feasibility.\" For Shell, ZeroAvia provides a valuable use case for sectoral decarbonisation. And who knows? It might really take off. REFERENCES [Ref 1] Adolf, J., Balzer, C., Louis, J. et al.: \"Shell hydrogen study energy of the future?

However, in some cases, the highest risk for a person lies in the road travel to a site! Automation technology itself is not the challenge; it exists and Shell uses it a lot. It has unlocked new business areas such as deep-water seabed operations. No person ever goes out there to open a valve, read a gauge or paint structures. So why have onshore facilities not been fully automated? The answer is simple: cost. A walking person is often still cheaper than the sum of the available fixed automation technologies. Modern robotics, however, provides an alternative that mimics the benefits that the mobility of a person provides. One moving person or platform represents a thousand sensors. Robotics is about safety, efficiency and cost, and is an area Shell must embrace, especially when combined with digitalisation. The digitalisation journey Robots can be thought of as mobile automation, as they introduce mobility into traditionally automated activities by enabling a single tool or sensor to move around a facility as required. Such robots may one day address all the dull, dirty and high-risk tasks currently executed by humans. This creates a challenge though, as people are often fearful of new technology and change, so the challenge for Shell is how to incentivise the ecosystem. The fact is that there is more work to do with fewer people, so, for Shell to stay competitive, robotic technologies must be deployed to free human workers from simple repetitive tasks and enable them to focus on high-value-adding work. Communicating this fact must be done on a case-by-case basis, though, to ensure that all parties in the ecosystem benefit from these changing ways of working. Robots are currently mainly used to mechanise existing activities; a painting robot is merely a mechanised brush. By introducing a digital workflow, the efficiency of robots can be increased. For example, in maintenance robotics, integrating multiple robots into one business work process promises many benefits: the painting robot will only paint when and where the inspection robot has found a bad spot ( Figure 1 ). This is preventive maintenance in action, based on actual data, not modelled planning! More obvious is the value of digitalisation to data-collection work processes. When integrated into an existing workflow, a robot acts as a consistent data-collection device to feed digital work processes and create actionable insights for the human operators. The end-to-end process is the same for all robots, whether they fly, drive or swim. A robot is just a mobility platform; it is the data they collect that generate value. Like a person who gains experience over time, artificial intelligence keeps growing, yet that experience is instantly available to all robotic systems and will never retire. At Shell, this workflow is in place and is running for certain classes of robots. The Sensabot programme Ground surveillance robots are a foundational part of the Shell robotics programme: the FIGURE 1 Digitalisation for storage tank turnarounds.TRAN- SITION Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021 36Yesterday Multiple people doing a job (safety risks, etc.)Today From one person commanding one blasting robot to one person supervising ve autonomous blasting robotsTomorrow One person supervising a multitasking fleet of robots, for example, one robot collecting paint-thickness data so that the painting robot only paints where necessary Paint-thickness data collected to instruct robots where to paintInspectClean RepairFabric maint.Sensabot programme has run for more than a decade. Robotics technology had always seemed promising and it all came together in the Kashagan project: frontier technology for a frontier location. Frigid in winter, scorching in summer, remote artificial islands in the Caspian Sea and high hydrogen sulphide levels, all the industry extremes in a single location. Given the travel, health and safety challenges, responding to an alarm at a remote location was an expensive and time-consuming activity; it could take many hours or even many days to check out an issue because of the weather. This challenging environment provided the justification for solving the technical hurdles of robotics and proving that remote robotic operations were viable. To address this challenge, the Sensabot ( Figure 2 ) was developed. This is a big machine with many sensors and able to survive the extreme climate. Some of the lessons learned for Kashagan include that: designing equipment for hazardous areas where there is the risk of fire or explosion (Ex design) is difficult: it creeps in to all the details and adds to the weight; if you want low maintenance, get rid of the Ex-p (pressurised Ex enclosure) features and make robustness choices; and export compliance, shipment and local support require time and money. For Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij (NAM), the Sensabot offered an interesting value proposition to reduce people on board offshore, yet the technology and commercial ecosystem needed to mature more. The NAM onshore gas production facilities offered an opportunity for this, as a robot would enable tasks lists to be reorganised and thus reduce site visits from twice a week to once a month. Calculating the benefits of travel and time savings enabled a commercial price target to be set for the robot. With the original Sensabot, the team was looking to prove the technology, but with the next model, a commercial mindset was adopted that required a different approach. During the project scoping, the team learned the following valuable lessons: The total cost of ownership is crucial, therefore scale is needed through wide industrial adoption. Commercialise; do not build a customised Shell tool. Simplify: 30 Shell people will have 300 requirements. Stop aiming for perfection; start with a minimum viable product. What does a person do? See, hear, walk and communicate. So, a robot only needs a camera, a microphone, wheels and 4G-LTE wireless technology. Only do what is strictly necessary and then add additional capabilities once success is demonstrated. Shipping a robot is better than people travelling. Instead of putting more robot technicians on the road (while taking operators off the road), broken robots can be swapped to provide continuity and repaired at a central workshop. Changing work processes takes time and requires long-term learning and commitment in the whole organisation. By taking this commercial approach, the Sensabot Mark 3, now known as the ExR-1 ( Figure 3 ), FIGURE 2 The Sensabot Mark 2: The world's first IECEx Zone 1 mobile resident robot. FIGURE 3 ExR-1 robots out in the real world. 37 Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021 was an order of magnitude cheaper than previous versions, a fraction of the weight and easier to deploy. NAM ordered the first 10 of a total scope potential for 100+ but had to step out of this programme in 2020 because of business pressure during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the meantime, the robots were getting attention at larger sites to help automate some repetitive tasks, primarily emission detection. The robots were given gas detectors but needed autonomous navigation. Line following using the robot's downfacing camera was selected as the cheapest and fastest option for autonomous navigation. Within a few months, the systems were demonstrated successfully ( Figure 4 ). However, line following outdoors offered some good and bad revelations. A good one was that on-site staff get used to these robots and keep routes clear of objects and sometimes even make scaffolding tunnels for them. The bad surprises were that weather, light changes and surfaces affect navigation, for example, a 40-year-old concrete floor turned orange, like the lines, when wet. Today, the reliability level is such that these robots can run unattended. Yet, a robot still operates on the permit-to-work principle, that is, a person needs to verify that it is safe to start a mission, as for on-site operators. When a remote person is about to start a robotic mission, they make a call to the permit desk for permission, then press the button and the robot runs its mission to the end. In the case of a high gas level, the robot's control screen starts flashing and sounding an alert to trigger a direct response. However, robots notice the low-level leaks too; they are finding very small parts-per-million leaks with greater reliability than traditional systems and manual processes. Many hydrocarbons are heavier than air, so, because the robot is close to the ground and runs around the equipment, it will come into contact with any gas leak. Leak detection is now moving towards emission detection with the goal of catching the tiny leaks that cause greenhouse gas effects. To address Shell's <0.2% methane-leak commitment for liquefied natural gas facilities, a test is being performed on an ExR-1 with a FLIR G300a optical gas imaging camera on its back in an Ex housing. Running emission-detection rounds is now proven; it happens daily at Pernis refinery in the Netherlands. The next challenge is to move further into operator rounds: spotting evolving issues before they cause a leak. So, not just reading gauges, but general site integrity monitoring. This is a good example of tasks that can be automated to enable the operators to focus on more valuable activities such as line-ups and first-line-maintenance. In this scenario, the robot is merely the roaming camera. The real magic happens in the cloud, where machine vision algorithms analyse the pictures (Figure 5 ) and convert the data to actionable insights. The end-to-end data flow ( Figure 6 ) is fully automated and data are written to the data historian ready for analytics. Shell has a growing suite of applications and is continuously adding new categories and improving the running ones. Giving project teams a leg (or four) up in construction Quadrupedal ground robots can rightly claim more intriguing and inspiring marketing than their tracked counterparts. Legged robots, with advanced control capabilities, offer agile, highly mobile platforms that enable an increasing variety of payloads to go to worksites and remote locations. The commercial availability of Boston Dynamics' Spot (Figure 7 ) robot was a groundbreaking THE ROAD TRAVELLED SO FAR TO GROUND SURVEILLANCE ROBOTS Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021 38 FIGURE 4 The robot follows the orange line round the plant while making its surveys. FIGURE 5 ExR-1 machine vision examples.moment for industrial robotics, specifically quadrupedal systems, and generated significant interest across many industry sectors, including construction. Key players in the architecture, engineering and construction domain, including Brasfield and Gorrie and Foster + Partners , have been quick to configure and deploy Spot robots, with a focus on automating the collection of visual data on construction sites. By automating site surveying, construction teams are no longer reliant on specialist contractors or personnel, which reduces costs and offers digital capabilities fed by these data, for example, 4D progress monitoring and safety threat detection. Using robotic platforms for site surveys improves capture consistency, thereby enabling time-related comparison against prior captures and building information models. Construction sites can be dynamic environments where weather and activity can significantly change the context in which a person or robot needs to navigate and manoeuvre. This is where quadrupedal type robots offer a point of difference. Both Boston Dynamics' Spot and Anybotics' ANYmal D robots feature the same lidar and cameras that drones and crawlers use to understand their environment, identify obstacles and plan routes. It is, however, the legs that offer greater efficiency of movement than unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and make them better suited to handling common construction site features (such as scaffolding) compared with a crawler robot. Table 1 compares quadrupedal, crawler and aerial robots. The value of a remote site presence The COVID-19 pandemic has forced everyone to consider ways in which to access construction sites, facilities and colleagues remotely. Shell's construction sites are no exception. In addition to creating a viable way to execute routine site surveys, quadrupedal systems also offer construction teams a chance to collaborate with remote engineering and project teams. 39 Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021 Collect data Store in cloud Apply machine vision and learning Support decision- making leading to value creation Create actionable insight FIGURE 6 The digital end-to-end workflow. FIGURE 7 A Spot robot taking a trial \"look\" around Pernis refinery.THE ROAD TRAVELLED SO FAR TO GROUND SURVEILLANCE ROBOTS Site visits offer remotely located personnel an opportunity to build relationships with site teams and to understand the context in which work is being conducted, which can be key to fully evaluating the risks and opportunities relating to delivery. With Spot, ANYmal and their crawler counterparts, this is a capability that can be delivered: site personnel can \"walk the dog\" to key work areas while having a live dialogue with remote personnel. Through the Shell Robotics, Digital Project Delivery and Future of Construction programmes, work is now ongoing to test the value of these solutions through the delivery of a user experience that modernises work. Shell's digital infrastructure and services are ready to plug in a Spot robot at any time using the same cloud portal as for an ExR-1. (Watch this short video comparing a Spot robot and an ExR-1 in action.) As per the journey of the ExR-1 and Sensabot systems, this is a learning exercise with opportunities to exploit synergies with digital initiatives across Shell. The future is now Ground robotics are, today, where UASs were a decade ago. The hardware is available and a growing number of deployments across industry are proving the viability of these tools. However, the tools are still early stage enough that end- users have questions about how to engage with them and get them deployed. As with UASs, commercially available tools breed a commercial ecosystem of suppliers and service companies that will help to move ground robotics from the innovation space to sustainable tools. Across the existing programmes, the focus is on hammering down costs. The price determines the size of the deployment volume and the success. Keeping it simple is keeping it inexpensive without any illusion or ambition of solving all the challenges at once. This focus on sustainability and cost is leading to replication opportunities. The ExR-1 robot, for example, is qualified as an emission detector. It is better than conventional leak detection systems and can run autonomous unattended missions with minimal effort for operating shifts. At Pernis refinery, there will soon be four robots running multiple missions daily. An additional 10+ deployments within a year are being worked on in Asia, the Middle East and North America. There is also growth in the use of non-Ex robots; for example, the Scotford complex in Canada has acquired two Spot robots to experiment with all kinds of non-Ex and manipulation tasks. The results are promising and give the teams confidence in using Spot robots for construction monitoring activities. In closing Robots offer an exciting opportunity for Shell to reduce health, safety, security and environmental exposure and increase production reliability and project progress insights and, ultimately, to do so at a lower cost. Consequently, the Shell robotics team is striving to keep the solutions built around these tools as cost-efficient as possible to maximise replication and value generation potential. There are always alternatives to robots (people, sensors, etc.), so it is critical that robots are benchmarked against these solutions to ensure that they are the Spot ExR-1 and ExR-2 etc.Lidar, speakers, etc.Cameras and lidar Endurance (min) 90 120-360 30 (max.)

Shell is not doing this by itself though; an ecosystem of robot suppliers, integrators and service companies is emerging. This ecosystem is helping to increase access to the robots while driving down costs and increasing functionality. This will be critical to the normalisation of these robotic tools, as end-users will be able to focus on the solutions and not worry about robot supply. The future is bright for ground robotics, but changing processes and people's mindsets takes time. It is important that Shell continues to deploy these robots so that solution confidence, value achievement and learning progress. Robotics is a great example of technology innovation that will propel Shell's competitiveness and ability to meet its Powering Progress goals.

They provide low volatility and viscosity, excellent purity and thermal colour stability, which make Shell GTL oils optimal ingredients for producing TPEs. Recent legislation such as the German Association of the Automotive Industry standard VDA 278 and strict requirements from equipment manufacturers require that Shell Lubricants closely controls the fogging properties of the process oils used in TPEs. Therefore, a Shell technical team set out to determine how to ensure that every batch of product meets the fogging criteria. This required considering the entire supply chain, including Shell GTL oils and paraffinic Group II base oils. Fogging: The issue When TPEs are used in automotive interior applications, certain substances from the manufacturing process can evaporate at elevated temperatures and may cause the phenomenon of fogging on glass or other surfaces in the vehicle. This is distinct from climate-related problems such as humidity leading to condensation on cold surfaces. The fogging effect is due to the condensation of semivolatile organic components, termed FOG, released from materials, including TPE compounds, used in vehicles. These include the mineral or process oils that are typically used as plasticisers or extender oils in polymer compounding (see boxed text, TPE compounding oils). In recent years, in a move to improve passenger comfort, health and safety, regulations have been introduced relating to odour, fogging and FOG emissions. Automotive interior materials are now tested according to standards such as VDA 270, VDA 278, ISO 6452 and DIN 75201-B. As major car manufacturers such as Daimler and the Volkswagen group have tightened their specifications, it is now necessary for producers to test process oils or commercially produced TPEs for use in automobile interior compounds for the same properties. Fogging is one of the most important of these. German standard VDA 278 defines FOG components as condensable substances in the boiling range of C 14-C 32 n-alkanes. Some attempts have been made to reduce fogging by using high-viscosity process oils and/ or solid resins to produce TPE polymers. However, the use of high-viscosity oils causes undesirable increases in the viscosity of the TPE compounds leading to difficulties and increased energy costs when handling such high-viscosity substances at manufacturing plants. GTL oils for TPE compounding The Shell Lubricants business-to-business (B2B) team offers a wide range of technical-grade GTL process oils, including medicinal grade white oils, Climate-related condensation is common in humid environments. TPE fogging is a very different issue that Shell researchers are helping to understand and eliminate.TRAN- SITION Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021 42for TPE customers to enable better processability and finishing of their products (see boxed text, B2B or B2C?). These oils are cleaner, highly refined paraffinic oils that are suitable as plasticisers for the compounding of TPEs. The portfolio of oils manufactured consequently has a uniform molecular structure: mainly highly saturated linear paraffins with few side chains. In comparison, conventional oils found on the market contain higher levels of polar components. This feature contributes to good compatibility, particularly with styrene-ethylene- butylene-styrene and styrene-ethylene-propylene- styrene propylene diene monomer rubbers, as the molecular structure is similar. Some of the key advantages of using Shell GTL oils They are colourless and virtually odourless, and have significant advantages for compound and rubber blend processing. Compared with conventional process oils, Shell GTL oils demonstrate up to three-times lower viscosities. Shell Risella X 430 GTL oil has up to a four-times lower Noack evaporation loss compared with conventional group I and II oils available on the market (tested according to ASTM D5800, 1 h at 250\u00b0C). This improves the production environment and reduces FOG emissions. They exhibit excellent ultraviolet (UV) stability properties and resist discoloration, which is of primary importance to TPE customers. They have excellent temperature stability at given test temperatures compared with group I and II conventional oils. Shell Risella X oils and Shell Ondina X have very low levels, comparable with medical white oils, of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Their purity is in line with the requirements for formulations that meet more stringent legislation, which makes them appropriate for applications requiring higher levels of purity. Shell GTL white oils meet the purity requirements of the US and EU pharmacopoeias. Additionally, Shell technical grades conform to US FDA 21 CFR 178.3620(b) requirements with respect to UV absorbance limits. Shell Risella X and Shell Ondina X oils have lower viscosity and more linear molecular structures than conventional mineral oils. When used in TPE applications, they can contribute to better flow of the melt and aid in providing better extrusion and injection-moulding characteristics, key elements in the production process. Shell GTL oils are used as extender oils for producing various parts for automobile interiors; these include mats, instrument panels, dashboards, buttons, encapsulation seals, cup holders, gaskets, bushings, cables, car locks and comfort items. Modelling development: Predicting fogging for process oils Some key TPE customers may not have the appropriate laboratory equipment at their production sites for testing every batch of process oil delivered. If the customer subsequently produces a TPE compound and it does not meet the fogging performance criteria, they immediately see that a potential root cause could be the process oil they have used. In consequence, there is the potential risk of Shell Lubricants losing their business. More immediately, the customer may submit a claim for the loss of the product for not meeting the fogging specification because of the process oil used. Therefore, in a customer-centric approach and as part of the quality assurance for Shell process oil offerings to TPE customers, a Shell Lubricants technology team initiated a study that set out TPE compounding oils Most process oils are derived from a crude oil distillation stream by a refining process. This may involve dewaxing to reduce the pour point, solvent extraction to remove aromatic compounds and hydrotreating to chemically modify aromatic structures. The degree of reduction in the concentrations of aromatics and impurities such as sulphur- and nitrogen- containing compounds depends on the type and severity of the refining process and the nature of the crude oil processed. The volatility of process oils increases from paraffins/isoparaffins to naphthene to aromatics. Group II paraffinic oils typically have more saturated rings and long paraffinic side chains. Paraffinic/isoparaffinic oils are generally the least volatile ones available on the market. They are characterised by good colour, stability and solubility of saturated compounds. Highly refined paraffinic oils also have the lowest content of polar and unsaturated molecules. These unsaturates contain impurities such as nitrogen, sulphur and oxygen that are highly susceptible to oxidation and colour degradation when exposed to UV light and/or heat. In contrast, Shell GTL oils are based on GTL synthesis technology that converts a very clean feedstock, natural gas, into high-quality liquid products that would otherwise be made from crude oil. The resultant base oil is very pure, contains almost no sulphur or nitrogen compounds, and is significantly more stable than conventional base oils. 43 Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021 RESISTING AUTOMOTIVE TPE FOGGING WITH GAS -TO-LIQUIDS BASE OILS to understand the correlation between the initial boiling point (IBP) of the process oil used and the fogging performance of the TPE compound from the commercial production process. The reason for developing this correlation was to qualify each batch of product by setting a minimum IBP requirement for Shell process oils that would enable them to comply with the fogging criteria of TPE customers. The oil samples used in this study included Shell GTL oils such as Shell Risella X 430 and Shell Ondina X 432, medicinal white oils such as Shell Ondina 941 and other types of oil. Fogging testing was done according to the DIN 75201:2011 gravimetric method. A series of oil samples was tested for fogging over a period of 6-8 mo. The initial phases of the process oil sample testing were mainly carried out at the laboratories at Shell Technology Centre Hamburg (STCHa), Germany, and Shell (Shanghai) Technology Ltd (SST), China (see boxed text, Measuring fogging). The process oil samples were also tested by simulated distillation according to the ASTM D2887 test method at the Shell Grasbrook Lubricants Centre, Germany, to measure the IBP of each of the process oils used. The results were correlated with the fogging results ( Figure 1 ). Correlating IBP and fogging The Shell team observed that the IBPs for different bulk deliveries of a high-viscosity, grade 600N base oil could range between 360 and 380\u00b0C. Figure 1 presents the correlation that the team developed and shows examples of Shell process oils. To read the graph: 1. Identify the IBP of the oil on the left axis. 2. Read horizontally to the IBP correlation (green line). 3. Read vertically to the red line. 4. Read off the fogging value on the right axis. The Shell team determined that a higher IBP correlates with less fogging and better colour. Lower volatility in the production environment will also contribute to improving employee health and B2B or B2C? B2B can be defined as any instance in which one commercial entity sells a product or service to another for use in its business. Selling to an end-user consumer, as an individual, for their own consumption or use would be a pure business-to-consumer (B2C) transaction. When the Shell Lubricants business developed its accelerated growth definitions, it defined B2C lubricants as those relating to branded passenger car motor oils and lubricants for maintenance and construction, whereas B2B lubricants were those concerned with transport, industrial and process oil applications.

Current analytical results show that Group II oils generate product fogging results of up to 10 mg, 20-times higher than those exhibited by Shell Risella X 430. On the basis of the data compiled, the team determined that a minimum IBP of 380\u00b0C is required to meet the gravimetric method minimum fogging criterion of <0.5 mg. The correlation developed is most useful for quality control of the certified product in customers' storage tanks and would avoid future claims from oils not meeting fogging criteria.Figure 2 provides confirmation of the graphical correlation. The figure shows the carbon chain length distribution results for samples of two Shell oils and indicates the components relevant to high fogging values in the TPE compound. These are lower molecular weight carbon structures (C 18 to C23) with lower IBPs. Table 1 shows the IBP results for various grades of process oils tested according to ASTM D2887 . These were used in the correlation to estimate the fogging behaviour of process oil batches before supplying customers. 45 Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021TABLE 1 Simulated distillation 444.0 4 47.1 5 7. 5 450.6 461.2 404 472.4 463.6 20 552.9 605.2RESISTING AUTOMOTIVE TPE FOGGING BASE OILS Testing TPE compounds containing GTL oils For this study, commercially produced TPE samples were collected from Shell Lubricants customers in North America. DIN 75201:2011 gravimetric fogging tests were carried out at the Intertek laboratory in Michigan, USA (see boxed text, Measuring fogging). This external laboratory was selected because it is approved by several car manufacturers for carrying out fogging testing for automobile interiors in North America. Figure 3(a) shows solid and pellet TPE samples prepared by a customer for the fogging tests. These materials are typically used for floor- and trunk-mat applications by automotive manufacturers in North America. The samples for the fogging study were made using Shell Risella X 430 and commercially available competitors' oils composed of mid- and high-viscosity process oils. The formulations for producing the TPE samples included SEBS polymers, resins, filler, stabilisers and process oils. The only differences in the raw materials used to make the samples were in the process oils used. The test results demonstrated that commercially produced TPE granulate samples using Shell Risella X 430 exhibited fogging of less than 2 mg, and less than 1 mg for some samples (Table 2 ). These TPE materials easily comply with manufacturers' criteria for use in automobile interiors. This study helped in achieving new technical approvals for the use of Shell Risella X 430 GTL oil in automotive interiors by TPE customers. Conclusions Through this study, the Shell Lubricants team has put in place a very precise benchmarking methodology for evaluating base oils and a relatively quick test method for understanding the expected fogging performance of the products. This method can also be used for quality control at storage facilities. In addition, Shell Lubricants now has a robust method for handling customer complaints and carrying out root-cause analysis. From the supply chain perspective, the correlations are useful for qualifying Shell process oils. This is Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021 46Measuring fogging Fogging tests are carried out to measure the tendency of plastic or elastomeric materials to release volatile substances that can, in use, condense and collect on other surfaces. The test method typically used in the TPE industry is DIN 75201:2011. There are two test methods, photometric and gravimetric. The gravimetric test used in this study involves the deposition of foreign material or residue on an aluminium foil surface. Figure 3 shows the test material and apparatus. A TPE sample is placed in a beaker and covered with aluminium foil. After a conditioning, heating and cooling cycle, the weights of the TPE sample and the aluminium foil before and immediately after the test are compared. The differences in weights provide a measure of the process oil's volatility and its condensable constituents. a b c dFIGURE 3 (a) TPE samples, (b) fogging apparatus, (c) material samples after exposure and (d) fogging foil after exposure.

One of the first tests performed on commercially available, innovative TPE samples that used GTL base oil clearly demonstrated fogging characteristics 60% better than TPE materials using conventional paraffinic oils, thereby confirming the high potential of these GTL oils for such applications.

Shell India has started a journey, based on shared ambitions of decarbonisation and energy transition, to develop, deliver and implement low-carbon pathways in collaboration with customers from core industrial sectors in India. Irrespective of the chosen decarbonisation pathway, it is apparent that there is a clear need for decarbonisation of the end-to-end value chain. This requires an integrated view and understanding of a well-defined \"system\" that often extends beyond the premises of a plant or factory. A systems-design approach and associated system-level models have been developed and implemented to create decarbonisation road maps and explore decarbonisation pathways for the cement and steel manufacturing sectors. The challenge The need for decarbonisation to control climate change cannot be overemphasised. It is also important to emphasise the need for action at scale to control, reduce and offset carbon emissions. This is imperative to avoid irreversible climate change and to stay within the targets set by the Paris Agreement. Industrial companies emit just under a third of global greenhouse gas emissions, 90% of which are carbon dioxide. Between 1990 and 2014, industrial greenhouse gas emissions increased by 70% and there is no change in the trend, largely because of increasing demand in consumption driven by increasing numbers of middle-class consumers and rapid urbanisation. Industrial sites have long lifetimes, so retrofitting, upgrading or replacing these facilities to reduce carbon emissions requires extensive planning and investment. Additionally, the minerals, metals, chemicals and power sectors are hard to abate owing to their relatively high share of emissions from feedstocks, fuels and high heat requirements. Decarbonising the industrial sector is technically possible, even with its engineering challenges and economic hurdles. The transition to a low-carbon future is ongoing and will embrace all sectors of economic activity, thereby creating new risks and opportunities. It is also important to account for the availability of niche technologies through innovation breakthroughs, rapid cost reductions in renewable energy and the availability of digital technologies to improve productivity, tracking and safety. The Energy and Resources Institute and Shell have created a detailed scenario sketch to explore the energy transition in the context of the ongoing development of the Indian economy [Ref 1] . Aligned to Shell's climate ambitions, Shell India is focusing on India's industrial sectors and has started a journey to develop, deliver and implement low-carbon pathways in collaboration with customers from core industrial sectors. Sectoral decarbonisation Implementing a lower-carbon future is a fantastic opportunity for Shell India to build additional internal capacity and capabilities and to create new global business models. These will help to drive the production of energy and carbon management solutions to meet the emerging needs of the regional and industrial sectors. Two industries ripe for change are cement and steel manufacturing. India is the second-largest producer of cement in the world, with huge growth potential. National initiatives such as smart cities will need significant new infrastructure and are expected to provide a major boost to the sector. The Indian cement industry is forward-looking and has been proactive in recent years in significantly improving its efficiency and reducing its carbon intensity. India was also the world's second-largest steel producer in 2019. The growth in the Indian steel sector has been driven by the domestic availability of raw materials and cost-effective labour. There is a huge potential for growth in the Indian steel sector, driven by the expected demand increase in the infrastructure, construction, automobile and railways sectors. The steel industry, with its global scale of operations and high energy intensity, is a prime candidate for decarbonisation. TRAN- SITION Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021 48The Indian steel industry is modern and forward- looking and has continuously upgraded brownfield plants to higher efficiency levels. The eagerness and readiness of India's industries to change are evident from the published decarbonisation goals of several of the major players and early adopters in each of the industrial sectors. As different companies and sectors determine their paths to decarbonisation, it is increasingly apparent there is a need for decarbonisation of the end-to-end value chain. Because each plant and factory depends on elements outside its control, success requires an integrated view of the entire value chain system and an inherent ability to adapt to varying environments. This approach is comprehensively covered by the three emission scopes the Shell team has used as the basis of its work. Scope 1 includes direct emissions from owned or controlled sources. Scope 2 covers indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heating and cooling consumed by the company. Scope 3 includes all other indirect emissions in the value chain. Addressing all these emissions in an efficient and insightful way needs a systems- design approach: a methodical approach for designing, commissioning, managing, operating, maintaining and retiring a system. Systems design and natural teams The Shell team knew it was entering uncharted territory when it first approached customers in the cement and steel industries. Success would require quick understanding of the complexity of these sectors, dealing with loosely defined problem statements and remaining flexible within an ever-changing environment. The tenets of the systemic approach were embedded in customer intimacy and a strong learner mindset. Careful attention was paid to the customers' challenges and natural teams were created by combining Shell and customer experts at project inception. The team members aimed to work together seamlessly on a decarbonisation path, despite diversity in backgrounds, approaches, organisations and time zones. The first step was to learn a customer's manufacturing process and to gather relevant contextual data. This helped in creating system (flow) diagrams so that stakeholders could visualise a cement or a steel plant as a full \"system\": Figure 1 shows examples. Through this shared understanding, the teams defined what was in and what was out of scope, key emission drivers and the main areas of focus. Joint workshops followed to ensure that the customer challenges were clearly articulated and that the pain points and levers to decarbonisation were clearly understood. A set of focus solution themes was identified for subsequent brainstorming sessions. The resulting ideas were ranked, categorised and organised to construct a tentative road map that laid out potential pathways to achieving the decarbonisation goals. Being able to see the path forward was exciting, but the road map was highly qualitative at this stage: it was based on FIGURE 1 Flow diagrams of the high-level (a) cement- and (b) steel-manufacturing processes.Systems design in context A system can be defined as a collection of elements that together produce an outcome unachievable by any of the single elements on their own. Systems design and systems engineering cope with the complexity of multiple elements and their interactions, help to avoid omissions and invalid assumptions, and can efficiently produce robust insights and outcomes. This approach provides a holistic understanding of the problem/opportunity space, a view of possible scenarios and traceability of the design intent and design changes of the elements, interfaces and interdependencies. Systems design provides a science-based approach to address the complex problem of decarbonisation. It is a logical pathway to a practicable, comprehensive approach to defining a system of interest (an engineering entity or an end-to-end value chain, etc.) and evaluating it from a multiple-degrees-of-freedom perspective. System-level models are powerful tools in the systems-design toolbox: they enable reliance on a single source of truth that can be used to identify or filter pathway options to decarbonisation targets. a bGypsum Cement Air Hot gas Clay Iron ore Limestone Petcoke Coal Raw meal/clinker Limestone Iron ore Coal Air Oxygen Coke oven gas Blast furnace gas Scrap metal Light oil Pig iron/steel 49 Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021 SECTORAL DECARBONISATION: A SYSTEMS APPROACH FOR CEMENT AND STEEL several key assumptions that still needed validation and did not account for interdependencies and synergies among the different solutions. This is where system design became essential. Starting with the system flow diagrams, the team superimposed equations that quantitively described the behaviour of the cement or steel plant and validated these behaviours against plant data. This prediction tool gave the opportunity to quantify different scenarios and assess the high- level impacts on costs, emissions and energy demands for potential future states of the plant. For cement, the models asked, for example, \"What would the impact be on the key performance indicators if the plant were to switch from petroleum coke fuel and coal-based electricity to a biomass fuel and renewable energy? What if you added an amine-based carbon capture system? What would the impact be if the plant switched to a new cement chemistry that used less clinker? How would that affect the key performance indicators?\" There are endless potential questions like these and endless combinations of feedstocks and technologies that are theoretically feasible. Although cement plants and cement manufacturing are largely consistent worldwide, the steel-making process is highly variable. For example, natural gas availability can lead to major architectural decisions: \"Does it make sense to keep using existing assets built for a certain process, say, the blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace route, or would it be better to switch to a completely new process such as a direct reduced iron, electric arc furnace? At what point should these changes be made to ensure success in achieving both medium- and long-term decarbonisation goals?\" The system model can adapt to guide these types of decisions and influence what the road map should look like. The team used the tool and methodology to explore a broad solution space and to evaluate hundreds of thousands of different scenarios. The results showed what technologies should be deployed as a \"bundle\" to fully realise their value, what solutions were appealing but needed significant cost reduction to become economically viable and what options were mature enough to be piloted as soon as possible. Ultimately, this helped to refine the decarbonisation road maps and to clearly understand the next actions for proving or disproving the assumptions. This approach resonated well with the customers, who could finally leverage a system-level quantitative tool to navigate through the complexity and uncertainty of decarbonisation options. The tool became a catalyst to convince the team that there was a need for an integrated solution space that could be conceived with systems design and Shell's unique and differentiated systems engineering capability. System-level models System-level modelling is best managed by starting simple with a set of clear questions to answer, as it is easy to become overwhelmed by all the possible technologies and scenarios, especially during the early stages of analysis. The Shell strategy is to start at a high level and to introduce increasing fidelity and complexity once the questions become more focused, intricate and interdependent (Figure 2 ). Sometimes, this means adding layers to the baseline models and letting the original model grow in size and complexity. At other times, it means switching from an Excel-based tool to a more multifunctional modelling platform. The system-modelling approach is a way to move the conversation from abstract and subjective to quantitative, with more objective discussions and decision-making. Using the model as a single source of truth, which all participants can always reference, keeps the discussions, explorations and evaluations objective and on track against a common baseline. This process facilitates a reasonable and healthy debate on varied approaches while the model keeps the dialogue grounded in fact. This system-modelling approach is a differentiator for Shell in energy and carbon management. Rather than pushing point solutions, Shell strives to discover integrated solutions grounded in quantitative analysis. During the initial stages of working with a model, there is more interest in identifying the wrong answers (or, infeasible and/or irrelevant design space) so that they can be promptly eliminated from the focus and scope. Initial questions could include, \"What are the viable fuel feedstocks and/ or technologies that could help to meet the goals of the customer?\" and \"What carbon penalties or subsidies would make technologies competitive?\" As the viable solutions are downselected, the model can be queried for more detailed questions, such as, \"How would these new feedstocks and technologies affect the full system and interactions between its various parts?\" and \"What needs to change in the system to enable these solutions?\" Shallow \"Value chain\" Medium \"Plant, project\" Deep \"Subsystem\"Level of detail Low Model delityHigh Analyse scenarios What might be right? Analyse solutions What is right? Effort sizeOptimise solutions What is best?Test scenarios What is wrong? Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021 50FIGURE 2 System-level model developmental phases. As the model becomes more complex and detailed, the final questions could target techno- commercial details, for example, \"How can the system be optimised in real time and meaningfully capture the real-world variations and variabilities for one or more objectives?\" Answering the final questions would be daunting and overwhelming if every possible solution set from the start of the journey had to be considered. Incremental and phased progression provides manageable steps to understanding complex systems and answering questions for discovering decarbonisation vectors. The models are based on first principles and are deterministic in nature: they use reasonable assumptions for mass and energy balances and plant manufacturing parameters and emissions. Some level of stochastic variability has been built in for variable input parameters such as carbon pricing, taxes and commodity pricing of conventional and renewable energy. Once developed, the model outputs are validated against plant data to ensure acceptable levels of predictability and confidence for key output parameters relating to carbon reduction. Illustrations of decarbonisation road maps Cement sector The starting raw materials for cement manufacturing are limestone and clay, which are fired in a rotating kiln at about 1,500\u00b0C. This causes the physical bonds to break and results in a dark grey, lumpy and nodular material called clinker. The clinker is mixed with other additives such as gypsum, fly ash and slag, and then ground in large vertical rolling mills to mix all the ingredients into the fine, light grey powder known as cement. The cement is mixed with water to make mortar and then with aggregate such sand or gravel to make concrete. Close to 90% of carbon emissions in cement manufacturing are from the kiln and preheater operations ( Figure 3 ). Of these, 60% are a direct result of the thermal decomposition of limestone that occurs between the preheater and the rotary kiln. The remaining 30% of the emissions are due to the combustion of carbonaceous fuels such as petroleum coke that must be burned in the kiln at a high temperature to thermally decompose the limestone and form clinker. For the cement sector, the Shell team used the system modelling approach to drive discussions both internally and externally. First, they developed an Excel-based model to characterise the cement manufacturing process in high-level terms. Aspects such as electrical and thermal energy demands and related emissions, and process emission sources such as calcination and organic carbon contributions were considered. The team then layered in carbon capture technologies and considered the associated costs and energy demands. This scenario evaluation tool was used to assess the high-level impacts on costs, emissions and energy demands for various potential future states or scenarios of plant operations. There were many possible questions and feasible combinations of feedstocks and technologies. This effort started by using literature and publicly available data sources. Internal discussions and critiques got the model to a level of maturity at which the team had reasonable confidence in it. They periodically reviewed the model with customers to get their direct feedback. These discussions enabled adjustment and refining of Chemical reaction: CaCO3 (limestone) => CaO + CO2 Preheater and calcinerCement thermal transport and logistics~60% ~10% 30%<1% 51 Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021FIGURE 3 Key areas of emission contributions in cement manufacturing. SECTORAL DECARBONISATION: A SYSTEMS APPROACH FOR CEMENT AND STEEL the tool for better reflection of plant operations mapped and validated against plant data. Once the model was refined using validated plant data, the team used the tool to perform trade- space analyses. Unique plant configurations were evaluated and plotted against cost and carbon intensity. Clusters and Pareto frontiers emerged that indicated generally where different groups of solutions existed for these two metrics ( Figure 4 ). Other clusters included hydrocarbon fuels with and without carbon capture, as well as hydrogen hybrid fuel mixes with and without carbon capture. Interesting observations included that: hydrogen fuels without carbon capture will not solve the problem. This may seem obvious given the emission contributions from the calcination process but was reinforced through the model analysis. hydrogen costs need to reduce significantly to play a meaningful role in the decarbonisation road map. This fact was not surprising, as hydrogen was being compared against petroleum coke fuel, which is inexpensive in comparison, but it was accentuated and quantified using the model outputs. electric intensive carbon capture technologies such as oxy-fuel combustion (instead of air-fuel combustion) will not help much unless electricity production is simultaneously decarbonised. The team likes to think of this scenario evaluation tool as an instrument for enabling directional or vectoral choices. It is a tool that enables rapid incorporation of alternate fuels, feedstocks or technologies and evaluation of whether they are impactful. From there, it is possible to focus on the items that show merit and build more complex tools to answer newer component interaction questions. Using the model helped in developing several potential decarbonisation pathways based on the scenarios that scored well in the concept downselect phase. This is not to say that no other options were considered or that these are \"the\" scenarios, but they do represent viable pathways for achieving carbon negativity in the cement manufacturing process while meeting the industry's intermediate goals. The scenarios are not necessarily mutually exclusive and may be localised depending on certain constraints, for example, the availability of fuels at a specific plant location. Each scenario represents an approach with varying levels of risk and technology maturity, supported by a cost- benefit analysis and a tentative timeline to realisation. The scenarios prioritised for further engagement had finer levels of granularity to show relevance, realisability and readiness for implementation. These scenarios were presented to the customer through a virtual workshop at which they identified their preferred pathways and/or configurations, thus, ultimately, defining their decarbonisation road map. Iron and steel sector The steel-making process starts with heating crushed or pelletised iron ore with coke in a blast furnace at a temperature of about 1,800\u00b0C in the presence of air. If available, scrap steel can be added as a raw material to the blast furnace. At this sort of temperature, the oxides of iron are reduced by the coke as carbon dioxide and pig Net carbon intensity (t of carbon dioxide/t of product) Variable cost ($/t of product) Hydrocarbons without carbon capture Electricity intensive carbon capture with coal-based based power production Hydrogen hybrids without carbon capture Hydrocarbons without carbon capture Hydrogen hybrids with carbon capture Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021 52FIGURE 4 Model-based trade-off analysis. iron are formed. The resulting pig iron has some inherently bonded carbon due to the ore reduction reaction in the blast furnace. To make steel, it is necessary to reduce this carbon content by combining the pig iron with additional scrap steel in a basic oxygen furnace. The carbon is oxidised in the presence of oxygen. Adding limestone helps to remove other impurities, such as silica, as slag. Varying percentages of manganese, nickel, chromium, carbon and vanadium are added to make different grades of steel, which can be finished to bars, billets, blooms, tubes and coils. Unlike the cement-making process, in which most emissions are process related, steel manufacturing has multiple sources of carbon emissions (Figure 5 ). Raw material preparation and iron making in the blast furnace each account for about 33% of the emissions; the remaining emissions come from energy generation, steel making and the finishing processes. The system level model makes high-level abstractions of steel manufacturing and captures the complex relationships and interactions that occur between them. The computational model aims to capture enough details to help make well-informed decisions. It also helps in understanding the potential consequences of technology and other solution choices on decarbonisation metrics that include carbon intensity and differential specific costs for alternate fuels, process modifications and technology options. The bases of the model are the major process blocks and the associated energy and mass flows that define the relationships between inputs and outputs ( Figure 6 ). The model is intended to be a high-level plant assessment tool and therefore uses plant level aggregation for spatial scale and annual basis for timescale. To make the plant models more representative of real steel plants, actual energy and mass flow data are incorporated to define the process-level input-output relationships, while the mathematical formulation within the model takes care of the complex interactions. Similarly to the cement-sector model, the steel model was also developed in close collaboration with a sectoral customer to ensure that the assumptions and simplifications were appropriate for the intended use cases. Actual mass and energy flow data from various plants were used for the model development and validation. The steel system model's primary purpose is to perform high-level assessments of technology concepts to identify and screen promising options that would be efficient in reducing carbon intensity at a manageable differential cost, especially in the near term. It aims to capture the interactions between various concepts and identify the most synergetic and integrated solution suite. The model is amenable to sensitivity studies in order to identify the impact of changes in inputs on output metrics and the robustness of a concept's performance.

The costs are modelled on a differential basis to identify the incremental changes in costs when comparing potential technology concepts. Detailed accounting costs have not yet been modelled. Figure 7 illustrates a specific trade-space outcome (Pareto frontier on cost versus carbon intensity, Figure 7(a) ) and the impact on carbon intensity for a subset of combinations of technology choices and process levers against the baseline ( Figure 7(b) , with the baseline case being the left-most column). Conclusions and future scope Systems design provides a science-based approach to addressing the complex problem of decarbonisation with Shell customers. Through a data-driven approach, systems design helps to align all the stakeholders to a common view and ensures everyone is working synergistically on solving the same problem. It enables the team to make the right decisions quickly and objectively, thereby increasing execution efficiency and minimising rework. System-level models are powerful tools in the systems-design toolbox: they enable reliance on a single source of truth that can be used to identify or filter meaningful pathway options to decarbonisation targets. During the implementation phase, the models developed for Shell customers in the steel and cement industry are expected to provide a framework to identify key assumptions that will be foundational to the successful execution of a decarbonisation plan. The framework will enable scenarios to be tested early in the journey, strengthen confidence in the resulting decarbonisation road map and progressively increase its fidelity. In the future, the foundational work on building models for steel and cement customers in India can be leveraged to cover an increasing breadth of unique customer needs and geographies.

However, large construction projects such as the Pennsylvania Chemicals complex in the USA continue to present safety challenges. Teams from Shell's Projects Digital and the Pennsylvania Chemicals project therefore partnered with vendor Detect Technologies to use its T-Pulse digital solution. This is a novel, artificial intelligence (AI) enabled, machine vision solution for identifying construction hazards in near real time. It utilises video footage captured from construction sites and operating facilities, and a proprietary image-processing system to make safety observations and identify hazards in line with industry recommended practices. The T-Pulse solution is now available for deployment at other Shell sites. Background Shell has the responsibility to deliver capital projects safely while meeting key promises on cost, schedule and production performance. This drive for excellence imposes pressure on owner teams, which must keep strong oversight of activities on the ground while ensuring the safety of the people working on their projects. Technological advances in computing and sensors have made it possible to increase the breadth of control over complex construction sites. At the beginning of 2020, the Pennsylvania Chemicals project was at a critical stage of the execution cycle ( Figure 1 ). Every day, 7 ,500 people came to work at this highly congested construction site packed with process equipment. The tallest column on-site, the quench tower, is about 100 m high, and the loftiest steel structure rises to nearly 130 m above grade ( Figure 2 ). Hundreds of concurrent activities took place at height on any given day and across the entire 156-ha footprint of the construction site. From a safety management perspective, Shell's lean owner team was facing a huge challenge: how to focus on preventing the most consequential safety incidents. The project team was keen to identify a solution that would help them to maintain situational awareness site-wide and identify and mitigate high-risk areas. The challenge: Construction safety risks Multiple risks must be managed during the execution of capital projects to ensure that everyone goes home safely from construction sites. Owner teams put all the possible controls and barriers in place to ensure that nobody gets hurt while on the job but, unfortunately, incidents happen. Working at height and falling objects remain the top risks. According to a 2019 report by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) on cited safety violations across all workplaces, 45% are height related ( Figure 3 ) [Ref 1] . Moreover, the Bureau of Labor Statistics FIGURE 1 Aerial view of the Pennsylvania Chemicals project.TRAN- SITION Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021 56indicates that falls account for 39% of all fatalities in construction. Construction efficiency and safety are intrinsically linked; a safe site is also a productive site. Yet, construction efficiency still trails that of the rest of the economy by a significant margin. However, the availability of a skilled construction workforce in many parts of the world is limited: for example, in a 2018 survey, 57% of contractors in the USA reported difficulty finding skilled workers [Ref 2] . Therefore, many sites rely on apprentices. This may require heightened safety oversight and more interventions. The solution: Machine vision enabled by AI Smaller cameras, faster computers and an ever- evolving public library of machine vision algorithms based on vast imagery datasets have enabled many applications that are now familiar. Examples include unlocking a mobile phone using facial recognition and self checkout in stores. Within Shell, machine vision has been applied at retail stations to identify unsafe actions and behaviours, such as smoking, through a project called video analytics for downstream retail. More information is available in this video . These use cases rely on very large data sets fed to algorithms, mostly from the public domain, that enable intelligent decision-making. However, for construction sites, the learning data set remains quite limited and the understanding of safety is specific to the construction context. These make AI applications more difficult to implement and the benefits harder to realise.Machine vision on construction sites Camera-equipped unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) can be coupled with an intelligent image- processing system to develop insights that enable the site safety team to identify hazards in hard-to- reach areas, for example, at height, where providing consistent human oversight of activities can be problematic. Such a system can generate actionable safety insights in near real time, thereby efficiently augmenting in-person supervisory trips to elevated work areas. In the T-Pulse system, UAV video imagery of the area of interest is captured on-site and uploaded to Detect Technologies' cloud environment. There, the images are processed in less than an hour, and the results are returned to the FIGURE 2 Aerial view of the Pennsylvania Chemicals ethane cracker furnaces area. FIGURE 3 OSHA safety violations in 2019 [Ref 1]. 46% height related 8% Fall protection - training, 7% Machine guarding, 6% Eye and face protection, 5% 57 Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021 USING MACHINE VISION TO IMPROVE CONSTRUCTION SAFETY site team in the form of observations through a web portal (dashboard). Figure 5 shows a schematic of this system. Detect Technologies uses computer algorithms to identify and to highlight areas of interest, that is, potential hazards, on the basis of pretrained observation sets. It leverages a \"human-in-a-loop\" approach for processing the source imagery. In this, the algorithm provides the first pass to generate initial results quickly; these are then vetted by humans with the aim of continuously improving the AI system's capabilities through machine learning (see boxed text, AI principles). Human vetting of the results generated by AI helps to improve the algorithm so that it becomes more intelligent with each cycle. Detect Technologies' safety officer annotates observations and shares the results, along with marked-up images, video snippets and recommendations, with the site team via the dashboard. The site health and safety team then proceeds to assign criticality ratings to the observations, review the recommendations and execute remedial actions. Meanwhile, the AI feedback loop is closed. T-Pulse on the Pennsylvania Chemicals project The T-Pulse solution was first demonstrated to the project team in late 2019 in a one-off trial that generated serious interest in the technology. That led to an extended pilot study that started in February 2020 but was soon interrupted by the COVID-19 crisis. The pilot study eventually concluded in September 2020. The objectives of the pilot phase were to: 1. measure the value of the T-Pulse solution for improving safety in construction; 2. explore the ability to adapt the algorithms to site-specific conditions through a continuous feedback loop for increased automation of the process; 3. align T-Pulse reporting with the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers IOGP 577 recommended practices; and 4. assess the scalability of the solution across Shell projects and operating assets. The pilot's footprint involved an area of about 32 ha covering the ethane cracker unit, the polyethylene manufacturing units and the cogeneration plant (see Figure 5 ). These areas were characterised by the highest intensity and complexity of concurrent construction activities. UAVs were deployed to the pilot-study area for 2-3 h/d, when the weather was appropriate, and recorded site activities from a safe distance. The data collected were anonymous, i.e., not identifying any individuals; this was deliberate to AI principles To dive deeper into understanding AI principles, consider how a newborn baby makes sense of the world around it. Initially, there is perception of colours before moving on to shapes that then take another dimension for perceiving depth. A combination of these attributes enables the baby to identify the unique features that help to differentiate objects. Then, when these objects perform actions, the baby can derive inferences. Machine learning necessitates translating such understanding into binary 1s and 0s. Hence, a coloured image is converted to binary: black and white. When the machine applies a prelearned, weighted rule to convert this binary image into a net sum, it can be compared against a threshold to decide, in binary fashion, yes or no, whether it is a particular colour, shape or feature. This logic is compiled on multiple layers to facilitate feature classification and identification, thus enabling the system to identify objects in images ( Figure 4 ). FIGURE 4 Making machines observe. *Rectified linear unit Colour Colour Binary InputPooling Pooling Feature learning ClassicationFlatten SoftmaxConvolution + ReLU*Convolution + ReLU*Fully connectedTransform Apply Sum Threshold Autonomous cars Construction sitesInference FeaturesValue DecideShape Depth Features InferenceHow we see, perceive and learn Machines fundamentally infer binary Like us, this machine logic is layered for multiple features The mature algorithms that we see around usBicycleCar Truck Van Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021 58mitigate data privacy concerns. The imagery was shared with Detect Technologies' team for processing and first-pass analysis. In about 2 h, the classified and annotated observations were delivered to the health and safety team on-site for a thorough review. The results were presented in a web dashboard aligned with the IOGP 577 reporting categories ( Figure 6 ). Pilot-study results Figure 7 shows an example of a fall-hazard observation detected by T-Pulse: an individual is dangerously overreaching across the safety barrier to receive tools from another person. Through this observation, the safety team was able to provide the necessary coaching to the work crew. In another example, T-Pulse observed an exposed, open grating ( Figure 8(a) ). Safety barriers were installed before work was allowed to proceed in this remote, elevated area ( Figure 8(b) ). Through using the feedback loop during the study period, the following types of observations became completely automated: human and machinery activity detection; basic personal protective equipment compliance; open gratings; smoking; social distancing; and face mask compliance. Further value can be realised in a semiautonomous way, that is, by human vetting of the AI analysis.

It is only a matter of time, and the acquisition of a sufficient AI training dataset, until these semiautomated observations can also be generated autonomously. Eventually, further and more complex observations will be added to the toolset.During the 50-d pilot, T-Pulse generated 141 insightful safety observations (see Figure 6 for examples), of which 24 were classed as high or very high risk by the health and safety team. The timely identification and resolution of these hazards enabled by T-Pulse may have prevented serious safety incidents. Conclusion In the final months of 2020, the number of activities performed at height was gradually reducing. At the same time, seasonal changes were limiting the ability to observe work from the air, so the window of opportunity to use T-Pulse on the project was starting to close. The pilot study has established T-Pulse as a viable tool with excellent potential for managing safety risks in construction. For example, it was proved that a 2-h aerial drone survey, enhanced by 2 h of post-processing by T-Pulse, was equivalent, in terms of coverage and ability to provide insights, to 60 h of surveying the same 32-ha plot on foot. The ability of T-Pulse to observe work and detect hazardous conditions at height is unrivalled. The journey ahead for T-Pulse in Shell After the successful completion of the pilot study at the Pennsylvania Chemicals project, the project's digital innovation steering committee decided, in late 2020, to make T-Pulse available for deployment at Shell sites. Currently, a new service is in development to cater to demand at green- and brownfield projects as well as turnarounds.FIGURE 8 Example of an unsafe condition. Technology trends Future capabilities in AI, machine learning, robotics and sensor hardware are extremely enticing. This is an era of increasing use of unmanned aerial, land and underwater vehicles to achieve remote insights. Keeping construction safety in mind, the vision is to have a system that combines sensor data and edge processing on devices to provide real-time alerts to avoid potential hazards. Achieving this will require a complex interplay among on-ground infrastructure (the Internet of Things), including fast internet connectivity and appropriate sensors, and an integrating system that provide relevant insights to an individual in the field via a personal device. The near-term target is to reduce the time from the observation to the insight reaching the associated individual through increased automation of recognisable observations and edge processing of footage close to where it is collected. A pivot application of this technology during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has been to help identify actions for the real-estate team to ensure safe social distancing and face mask use through interventions on the basis of insights from remote monitoring cameras.

Machine learning models are trained using historical data to detect any abnormal behaviour that could indicate early signs of failure. By detecting an issue early, timely preventive action can be taken and potential unscheduled deferment or unplanned downtime can be avoided. Shell is rolling out predictive maintenance across its assets to improve their reliability and thus their efficiency. The challenge Traditionally, caring for equipment at Shell assets has relied on replacing parts after a set time. This approach sometimes means that parts are replaced while they are still in good condition. An alternative strategy is to wait until something fails. However, equipment failure means that an asset needs to shut down temporarily for repairs, which affects production. Physics-based models have gone a long way to improving these strategies. They can be used to monitor data from an asset and to help detect issues by determining when readings go above or below a certain point. Such solutions are still considered the best options for equipment with straightforward condition monitoring instrumentation. However, assets are under increasing pressure from the financial and reputational perspectives to increase their reliability. Making use of machine learning and artificial intelligence is the next step on the maintenance journey. The solution In a move to improve reliability at a refinery in the Netherlands, the instrument engineering team decided to investigate how artificial intelligence could help to detect control valve issues early on and thus help to avoid unscheduled deferment or unplanned downtime. The team worked with Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands, and the Shell digital team to assess how artificial intelligence could play a role in improving the reliability of Shell assets. Predictive maintenance for control valves was born from this collaboration. Each Shell asset captures many thousands of data points every minute, far too many for the human brain to analyse or identify patterns in. As a result, Shell data scientists have developed machine learning models that can analyse thousands of data points simultaneously and thus enable engineers and others to draw insights from these data. Using historical data, the machine learning models are trained to recognise anomalies in data sets. Alerts are triggered when small anomalies are detected so that further investigation and more proactive maintenance can occur. Predictive maintenance machine learning models are currently being trained and rolled out at assets across the company. In 2020, a refinery in the Netherlands reached an important milestone in its predictive maintenance journey: all the suitable control valves across the asset were successfully modelled and being monitored by predictive maintenance applications. Within a short time, the predictive maintenance models gave alerts for 65 control valves that were in need of repair and that would not have been detected using traditional methods. In January 2021, a refinery in Singapore was the next to reach this important milestone, closely followed by assets in the USA and Canada in March. More assets are expected to follow soon. Integration with work processes Predictive maintenance models are fully integrated into the central exception-based surveillance work process, part of the ensure safe production process in Shell's asset management system. For most assets, this means that a remote engineer analyses any alert first, see Figure 1 . After this initial investigation, the remote engineer passes on valid findings to either a TRAN- SITION The Predictive Maintenance Programme The Predictive Maintenance Programme is responsible for deploying machine learning models across all asset-based lines of business in Shell. The programme's main objective is to improve reliability through the detection of early signs of upcoming failures of equipment in assets and to help prevent unscheduled deferment and unplanned downtime.

This process aims to reduce the effort required from the asset and enable engineers to focus on validated alerts. The asset engineers work closely with maintenance teams to assess any issues and take action where necessary. Success in Singapore In September 2020, a machine learning model was created to monitor a globe control valve at a refinery in Singapore. Such valves are the final control elements used to start, stop and regulate the flow of process fluids. They do so by controlling the position of a movable plug relative to a stationary seat. This controls the area the process fluid can flow through and, therefore, the flow rate. Over time, the mechanical parts of the control valve that interface with the process fluid, such as the plug, the seat and the gland packing, may degrade and cause potential leakages or reduced controllability. This situation is intolerable, especially if the valve has a safety- critical function, i.e., it acts as a barrier that prevents the uncontrolled release of a hazard that could lead to a worst-case-credible scenario. Thus, it is very important to ensure that the control valve is operating appropriately. As part of the Predictive Maintenance Programme, the project team modelled the expected positioning of the valve based on the process conditions and then began monitoring its actual and predicted positions. Subsequently, the predictive maintenance for control valves application detected a deviation between the valve's actual position and its predicted position and triggered an alert. In Figure 2 , the blue line shows the actual valve position (percentage open) obtained from the distributed control system and the green line shows the C3 AI prediction. The green boxes show when the deviations occurred. FIGURE 1 The predictive maintenance alert process.

The predictive maintenance model was created in September 2020 but was able to show that the erratic valve movement had started several months earlier. Local instrument engineers analysed the report and validated the observations. The unit maintenance focal point then carried out a site investigation to validate the findings and correct any potential choking. A pump-through was performed on the transmitter's impulse line to clear the potential choke. The data monitoring for the two subsequent weeks confirmed that the control valve hunting had significantly reduced. In Figure 3 , the green line shows the control valve position from the distributed control system and the blue line indicates the level. The green box shows when the corrective action occurred. It is clear that cleaning the choked impulse line eliminated the valve's hunting behaviour. Thanks to early intervention, significant reported value has been confirmed. A failure caused by this control valve problem could have resulted in hydrocarbon breakthrough downstream that would have meant lost production margin through shutting down the sour-water stripper for cleaning and the need for flaring. It could also have resulted in a period of lower quality product because of the poor controllability of the control valve in the fractionator unit. Deepwater platform early warning Another interesting issue recently arose on the other side of the world at a deepwater platform in the Gulf of Mexico, where predictive maintenance machine learning models for all the suitable control valves were successfully deployed to monitor and optimise their performance in December 2020. A few weeks later, the predictive maintenance control valve application detected an anomaly in the data from the positioner valve that controls the flow to the first phase of the vapour recovery unit and triggered an alert. The remote engineer observed deviations between the valve and the feedback from the positioner, which was causing fluctuations in the flow signal. Although the flow was regular, there were some disturbances. The red line in Figure 4 shows the controller output. The green line shows the control valve position feedback and the blue line shows the process variable. The process variable was found to be linear with respect to the valve position feedback, so, in response, the controller output was attempting to bring the process variable back to the set value. Consequently, the engineer contacted the local focal points and recommended an investigation into the health of the control valve. The investigation revealed that the valve was swinging by 5-10% and up to six times in less than a minute, and then the movement almost stopped only to start again. This was repeating continually. As a result, replacement or repair of the valve positioner is being considered. This early detection of a potential issue means that maintenance to the valve can be proactively planned at the best time for the asset.

Commercialisation The predictive maintenance solutions were recently released to energy operators in the open market via the Open AI Energy Initiative , which was launched by Shell and partners Baker Hughes, C3 AI and Microsoft. It is an open ecosystem of artificial intelligence based solutions specifically for the energy and process industries. By bringing its solutions to market and encouraging others to do the same, Shell hopes to accelerate the adoption of artificial intelligence technology across the industry. The Open AI Energy Initiative provides an open framework for building interoperable solutions such as artificial intelligence and physics-based models, diagnostic libraries and services. We are excited to offer these and additional (future) capabilities to the market and participate in the creation of an open ecosystem that can benefit the entire energy industry. What's next Currently, there are two main products available: one for monitoring control valves and one for rotating equipment. A new application has recently been launched that combines rotating equipment (centrifugal compressors, centrifugal pumps and steam and gas turbines), subsea electric submersible pumps and a recent proof of concept on dry gas seals. With this new application, the time required to assimilate new equipment is expected to reduce significantly. In addition, the replication time across assets for the same equipment type will be shorter. The Predictive Maintenance Programme is continuously looking for new opportunities to enhance existing products, improve adoption and identify new use cases where machine learning can be applied to improve equipment reliability. Several developments are under way to investigate the possibilities of comparing whole systems such as parallel reactors or liquefied natural gas trains. Another interesting initiative is looking at the possibilities of using machine learning to monitor a whole asset. In parallel, deployments continue worldwide to increase reliability and improve equipment care strategies.

The company is introducing Shell Ondina X gas-to-liquids (GTL) oils as alternatives to the white mineral oils commonly used in adjuvant emulsions. The purity and hydrocarbon structures of GTL medicinal grade white oils can provide considerable benefits. A Shell team is working with consultancy firm Sustainable Chemistry Consult to introduce Shell Ondina X oils and is seeking approval from formulators for their use as adjuvants in animal vaccines. The initial results are promising. The challenge Vaccination is the principal strategy for the prevention and control of diseases in animals, and adjuvant use is an effective tool to enhance a vaccine's efficacy. By using an adjuvant, a smaller dose of antigen is necessary to stimulate the immune response. Adjuvants have two objectives: they slow the release of antigens (the vaccine's active substance) from the injection site and they can strengthen the stimulation of the immune system. Emulsions are often used for the former. Emulsions are the most frequently used vaccine adjuvant formulations for veterinary vaccines. For this, the antigen is dissolved in water and then dispersed in mineral oil. This dispersion in the emulsion must be stable and fluid. Mineral oils are very efficient dispersers but can sometimes induce local reactions when carrying reactive antigens. In addition, adjuvants are mostly stored and injected at a low temperature (typically 4\u00b0C). Consequently, the emulsion should have a low viscosity for enhanced and fast injectability. Oil adjuvants (or so-called emulsion adjuvants: oil in water, water in oil or water in oil in water) facilitate slow release of the antigen by forming a reserve at the injection site. The antigen is trapped in the aqueous phase and is passively released as the emulsion degrades within the living organism. Commonly used emulsion adjuvants for veterinary and research purposes are based on white mineral oils. White mineral oil for general pharmaceutical use is obtained by refining paraffinic crude oils and removing polycyclic and volatiles. Thus, a mineral oil of pharmaceutical quality is a complex substance made up of alkanes (linear, branched and cyclic) with different carbon chains. The length of these carbon chains is crucial for vaccine safety and efficacy. Safety Studies have shown that shorter carbon chains (less than or equal to C 14) induce more local 1Adjuvant: a substance that increases the humoral or cellular immune response to an antigen The rising global population means increased demand for farming and meat products and thus more animal vaccination and with fewer side effects. TRAN- SITION Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021 66reactions that lead to significant and undesirable side effects, and that the most appropriate hydrocarbon chain length in white mineral oil is between C 15 and C 32. The oil should also have no aromatic compounds. Some of the key properties reported for white oils for use in adjuvants include a normal paraffin content of 10-25 wt%, a pour point between -3\u00b0C kinematic viscosity at 40\u00b0C of 3.5-8.0 cSt. These mineral oils correspond to the European Pharmacopoeia purity requirements for \"light mineral (paraffinic) oil\". Therefore, mineral oil adjuvants must be of low viscosity and high purity, and include nonpolar constituents to improve the efficacy of the final formulation when used in vaccines. Oil adjuvanted vaccines formulated as water-in-oil emulsions have been used to enhance immune responses in poultry. However, such vaccines containing liquid paraffins often cause granulomas (a type of inflammatory response) at the injection site in chickens. Literature data on guinea pigs have observed that both the immune response and the side effects of water-in-oil emulsions vary with the type of liquid paraffin used. The studies reported that these variations were due to the differences in the hydrocarbon structural composition of the liquid paraffins. Studies also have indicated that it is imperative to study the action of the various saturated hydrocarbons, for example, alkanes, derived from petroleum when selecting a liquid paraffinic oil for adjuvant use in vaccine development. The mineral-oil-based emulsion residue at the injection site can be minimised by increasing the dispersibility of the emulsion through decreasing its viscosity or adding a hydrophilic emulsifier (surfactant). Unfortunately, these adaptations sometimes negatively affect the emulsion's stability or the immunological response. However, some studies have shown that highly purified nonmineral based oils such as GTL oils are well tolerated, as they are rapidly metabolised and eliminated from the injection site, which means less local inflammation. (A mineral oil stays longer at the injection site and it is eliminated by macrophages and partially metabolised into fatty acids.) An opportunity The major medicinal white oils used in animal vaccines include products such as Marcol 52, Eolane 130, 150 and 170, and Drakeol 6 VR, and represent more than 25,000 t of the white oils currently being used in adjuvant vaccine applications worldwide. There are also some nonmineral-oil-based adjuvants that are used to avoid or reduce the side effects associated with mineral white oils. In addition, trials with plant- based oils have had only limited success. However, global population increases mean rising demand for farming and meat products and thus more animal vaccination. In addition, adjuvant manufacturers are now looking on the market for hydrocarbons that are free of substances such as pristane that can cause an undesirable autoimmune response and that also comply with the purity requirements of EU and US pharmacopeia regulations, as do Shell Ondina X oils (their registration as low-viscosity, synthetic paraffin oils in the German Pharmacopoeia is ongoing).

A Shell team is working with consultancy firm Sustainable Chemistry Consult on introducing Shell Ondina X oils. The team is seeking approvals from animal vaccine formulators, so Sustainable Chemistry Consult's experience with detailed procedures and expertise on formulation trials and immunity tests are crucial to better understanding of vaccine efficacy and safety. Shell Ondina X oils for adjuvants Shell GTL oils are based on Fisher-Tropsch synthesis technology, which converts a very clean feedstock, natural gas, into high-quality, low- aromatic liquid products that offer alternatives to crude-oil-derived mineral oils. Shell Ondina X GTL oils predominantly contain isoparaffinic hydrocarbon structures with long, linear-chain backbones and have been purified by hydrotreatment. The resulting medical grade oils are very pure, virtually free of aromatic, sulphur and nitrogen compounds, and significantly more stable than traditional white oils. For the adjuvant market, the Shell Ondina X products under consideration include the X 409, X 411 and X 415 grades, which have the following key features: The degree of hydrocarbon branching is relatively low. The level of cyclic saturated paraffins is very low (<2%). The oils are virtually free of aromatics and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The oils meet EU pharmaceutical and FDA purity requirements. Table 1 compares the properties of Shell Ondina X oils with other oils currently used in vaccine adjuvants (data collected from web sources). Shell Ondina X oils are currently being evaluated by formulators for use in adjuvants for vaccines for poultry, pigs, cattle and fish. Leading pharmaceutical companies in the veterinary vaccine field have been convinced of the oils' benefits, so testing is under way on these medical grade oils. Figure 1 shows the carbon number distribution for a traditional white oil compared with the Shell Ondina X grades X 409, X 411 and X 415. The data show that Shell Ondina X grades have a narrower carbon number distribution. Thus, they are likely to have improved oxidation stability resulting in optimal molecular weights compared with a traditional white oil with its much broader carbon number distribution. Consequently, it is likely that Shell Ondina X oils will show better and safer immune responses when used in adjuvants for vaccines. Figure 2 shows 3D gas chromatography plots comparing the chemical composition of a traditional white oil with Shell Ondina X 411. The plots clearly show that the mineral-oil-based product contains isoprenoid substances of toxicological concern, including pristane. Pristane is known to induce autoimmune reactions when injected into mice (a classical model for immunology studies). Even though both types of oils comply with the high-purity requirements in accordance with the EU and US pharmacopoeia, Shell Ondina X oils do not contain substances such as pristane, which indicates that adjuvants using such oils would have a higher safety profile and would be unlikely to induce chronic inflammatory responses when used in animal vaccines.

The physical properties of the Shell Ondina X grades clearly indicate that such oils can be used effectively in adjuvants and would be advantageous in a market currently involving traditional white oils, squalene and squalane. However, it is vital that the formulators make adjuvants from the higher purity Shell Ondina X grades to ensure optimum vaccine efficacy and safety (World Health Organization requirements). By selecting defined chain length ranges for the Shell Ondina X oils, different permeation properties can be achieved. Because of their chemical structure, these hydrocarbons have a low viscosity in relation to their molecular mass. The different average molecular mass of the Shell Ondina X oils enables control of efficacy and slow-release reserve properties. Their chemical structure also means Shell Ondina X oils cannot form haptens (products from reactions with body proteins), so should not cause allergenic reactions or complement activation-related pseudoallergies. The Shell Ondina X GTL oils are characterised by their homogeneous chemical structure. This factor would also provide the adjuvant formulators with advantages with respect to the physical and chemical properties that are beneficial in tissue distribution and metabolism. The saturated and low-branched hydrocarbons in Shell Ondina X oils are metabolised to organic fatty acids that can be reused by the body or degraded by beta oxidation. However, the highly branched hydrocarbons found in mineral oil products often lead to dead-end metabolites that are difficult to eliminate from the body. Shell Ondina X oil grades show excellent oxidation stability under chemical conditions and can protect hydrolytically sensitive molecules until they are absorbed by antigen-presenting or other cells that initiate the immunological response. In addition, as the highly pure, saturated hydrocarbons found in Shell Ondina X oils are nonconductive, they could possibly be used for a specific adjustment of liposome properties. A good outlook Through the initial promising trial outcomes provided by several pharmaceutical companies, the perception of Shell Ondina X oils in the adjuvant market and worldwide is expected to improve and lead to further testing. The following benefits are supported by proprietary data or published literature (references are available). When injected as part of a vaccine formulation, Shell Ondina X oils are: expected to show low tissue accumulation and rapid elimination when compared with mineral oils (based on feeding studies in rats); not expected to cause autoimmune reactions triggered by isoprenoid hydrocarbons such as pristane, as they do not contain these molecules; not expected to have adverse effects on fertility or developing embryos, as they are virtually free of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; not expected to affect the delicate adjuvant emulsion stability and thus should cause little tissue damage, as such high-purity medical grade GTL oils have a low viscosity owing to the presence of low-branched hydrocarbons. Shell Ondina X oils could be used as a more sustainable alternative to squalene-based adjuvants for influenza and coronavirus vaccines. Squalene oil is obtained from shark liver and it is estimated that the total annual shark catch is 100 million, including endangered species. Additionally, squalene oil can contain pristane. GTL oils might thus be a suitable alternative to squalene and, thus, indirectly alleviate the pressure on shark populations.

He is a mechanical engineer with a degree from Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Germany.The results of 28-d OECD toxicity testing indicate that Shell Ondina X 409 and X 411 oils are classified as readily biodegradable, whereas the Shell Ondina X 415 grade is classified as inherently biodegradable. These excellent biodegradability characteristics and the very low systemic toxicological risks for the high-purity medical grade Shell Ondina X GTL oils mean that they offer a high level of safety for use in adjuvants in animal vaccines. Customers wanting to use Shell Ondina X oils in adjuvants can be assured of high purity grades (free of aromatics and heavy metals) and microbe- free products through the high temperature of the hydrotreatment process and subsequent appropriate storage and handling practices, and specific packaging of products (when required). Apart from promising advantages when used as vaccine adjuvants, Shell Ondina X oils are suitable for other life science applications such as personal care, food processing and agricultural spray oils.

Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021 70VESSEL AIR LUBRICATION HELPS TO reduce maritime emissions The shipping industry is adjusting to a new normal with the introduction of targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increased costs, particularly for fuel, so vessel efficiency is now a top priority. Air lubrication systems (ALS) for a vessel's hull provide a viable solution for reducing fuel consumption and, thus, carbon dioxide emissions, and will play a role in decarbonising shipping (see boxed text, Decarbonising shipping: Setting Shell's course). Recent work by Silverstream Technologies and other manufacturers indicates considerable net power savings. Shell originally tested the Silverstream\u00ae System on one of its chartered product tankers; the sea trials demonstrated about a 5% net efficiency gain. In 2020, Shell installed the Silverstream System on the Methane Patricia Camila (Figure 1 ) liquefied natural gas (LNG) carrier, which was the first time Silverstream had installed a system on this ship type. Early testing of the system has shown power savings of up to 8%. Air lubrication technology Fuel consumption, carbon dioxide emissions and underwater noise levels are primary concerns of the maritime industry from both the economic and environmental perspectives. To mitigate these challenges, Shell Shipping & Maritime has looked at various technologies available on the market. One option that the team considered is air lubrication technology in which an air compressor or blower provides air to the bottom of the hull through dedicated air release units (ARU), see Figure 2 , that generate air bubbles beneath the ship. ALS technology is applicable to any vessel with a reasonably flat bottom area. The ARUs are distributed symmetrically on both sides of the vessel's centre line and issue air at a constant rate to form a layer of microbubbles that reduces the frictional resistance between the vessel and the seawater. The ALS constantly supplies air to the ARUs to ensure a uniform air layer is maintained to achieve the desired effect. The size of the microbubbles is important, as large bubbles cannot move inside the boundary layer and the buoyancy force influences their motion. An ALS generally consists of compressors, piping, control systems and ARUs. The vessel's equipment, piping and ventilation system may need rearranging for the installation of an ALS, but a system can be installed on new builds or retrofitted during a regular dry-docking period. Each proposal needs to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, as an ALS will be bespoke for its target vessel. An ALS can be used either to reduce fuel consumption at the same relative speed or to increase speed at the same relative power, depending on the trading requirements. FIGURE 1 The Methane Patricia Camila in dry dock for an ALS retrofit.FIGURE 2 The ARUs on the Methane Patricia Camila . TRAN- SITION Silverstream is a registered trademark Technologies BV. 71 Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021 The efficiency gain occurs irrespective of the weather conditions and correlates with the upper sea-state limit applied to the performance warranties of extant charter party agreements. For maximum efficiency at the lowest cost and to design a system that is fit for purpose, the pre-engineering phase for the target vessel should review the ARU arrangement, the structural design, the piping and air distribution, the compressor room design, the electrical supply and the control and automation systems, and undertake a hazard identification study. The design and fabrication of the ARUs should be reviewed and approved by the classification society and to the satisfaction of the attending surveyor. Structural interfacing of the ARUs is completed in accordance with shipbuilding standards and approved by the classification society following a satisfactory finite element analysis of the hull structure. Pressure testing and inspection by the classification society surveyor are carried out on-site. Analyses to confirm savings and potential emission reductions should be performed on a specific vessel according to its hull size and geometry using standard computational fluid dynamics packages. Silverstream technology Shell began working with Silverstream Technologies to test and prove the performance of air lubrication technology on a chartered MR1 product tanker, the MV Amalienborg , in 2015. This research and development partnership led to several feasibility studies looking at deploying the technology on LNG carriers before the installation of a Silverstream System on the Methane Patricia Camila in 2020. The Silverstream System uses compressors to supply air at hydrostatic pressure to cavities spanning the breadth of the vessel at the leading edge of the flat bottom. The microbubbles trailing behind each cavity merge to form a large air carpet along the flat-bottomed hull, thereby reducing the vessel's frictional resistance, as shown in Figure 3 . Lloyd's Register provided an independent analysis ( Figure 4 ) of the Silverstream System's performance on the MV Amalienborg using data from a BMT SMART SmartPOWER torque monitoring system and fuel flowmeters fitted to Decarbonising shipping: Setting Shell's course [Ref 1] Shell is increasing its shipping decarbonisation research and development capabilities, both internally and externally, to develop zero-emission fuels of the future. As well as helping marine customers to avoid, reduce and offset their carbon emissions, Shell is taking action on its own fleet. In addition to ALSs, Shell is helping the shipping industry to improve its efficiency, and thus lower its emissions, through a variety of means and projects: Shell's patented draft and trim optimisation software, Just Add Water System (JAWS), has been deployed on 62 Shell-operated vessels, which are each seeing up to 7% reductions in fuel consumption and associated emissions. This software has been licensed to Kongsberg Maritime to make it available to the wider industry. Shell partnered with Norsepower, Maersk Tankers and the Energy Technologies Institute to deploy Flettner rotors (rotor sails) on the LR2 tanker the Maersk Pelican (now renamed Timberwolf ) as a proof-of-concept project. Fuel savings, and associated emission reductions, of about 8% were achieved over the one-year trial. Shell provides lubricants and technical services for over 10,000 vessels in more than 700 ports across 61 countries, thereby helping customers to make their voyages more predictable, efficient and cleaner through a suite of solutions. Within its operations, the organisation is looking to reduce its carbon intensity further by introducing more sustainable packaging solutions for lubricants, supplying more in bulk and using solar energy at lubricant plants. Working closely with equipment manufacturers enables the introduction of more fuel-efficient engines and the development of the Shell Naturelle range of environmentally acceptable lubricants. The Shell LubeMonitor service helps customers to lower their emissions by reducing their consumption of lubricants through operational efficiency measures and technical services. Shell Accuport is a digital service that helps ship owners and fleet managers to track their lubricant use and manage liftings, thereby optimising deliveries and minimising movements.VESSEL AIR LUBRICATION HELPS TO REDUCE MARITIME EMISSIONS Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021 72FIGURE 3 The Silverstream System.Automation system regulates compressors depending on draught and speed Compressors k eep cavities lled with air at the r equired pressure During steaming of the vessel, air is injected into the bottom boundary layerthe main and auxiliary engines. These devices measured the shaft power and the fuel consumption respectively. The net power savings were given by: net power saving = PS + PV - PC - PD [Eq 1] where PS = the reduction in shaft power with the ALS switched on; PV = the equivalent power saving due to the velocity increase; PC = the compressor power; and PD = the drag penalty caused by the cavities. Figure 4 shows that the mean net power saving with the MV Amalienborg in ballast was 4.3%, though savings greater than 10% net power appeared possible. The mean average net power saving for the laden trials was 3.8%. It should be noted that these results are simple mean averages. Many of the data points were not taken at optimal operating conditions and the effects of sea state (wind, waves and current) were not accounted for in the laden trials. The trial also found that the performance of the ALS improved when the vessel's speed increased and that the system continuously provided net gains in performance even when operating in waves. In higher sea states (7+), the system was turned off, as it was almost impossible to discern an efficiency gain. Further trials showed about a 5% increase in net efficiency. Installation on the Methane Patricia Camila As a result of the successful trial on the MV Amalienborg and the subsequent feasibility studies, Shell contracted Silverstream Technologies in October 2020 to install an ALS on the Methane Patricia Camila , one of its owned and managed LNG carriers. The installation was completed successfully within the 37-d dry-docking period. The installation work was conducted by Sembcorp Marine Admiralty Shipyard in Singapore. The company installed 8 compressors in a machinery space towards the bow of the vessel and 16 ARUs in the bottom of the hull along with the associated electrical cabling, power and control systems and valve arrangements. In total, about 680 m of piping was installed in the ship between the compressors and the ARUs. As COVID-19 restrictions prevented service engineers from sailing with the Methane Patricia Camila , the ship's crew undertook commissioning and testing of the system on several voyages after departing from Singapore. In February 2021, sea trial performance testing was conducted in the ballast condition on a voyage between Thailand and Australia. Early results in varying weather conditions indicate an average net power saving of 5.6%, though a saving as high as 8.1% was seen on some runs. These in-service performance results are close to the predicted net efficiency power gains of 7 .7% in ballast and 6.7% laden estimated before installation using Silverstream Technologies' experience of analysing performance gains from three full-scale installations, cavitation tunnel testing at HSVA in Germany and information provided by Shell. This included a correction applied to the savings calculations to account for the added drag of the ARUs with the system switched off. The results from the cavitation tunnel testing showed that the average drag penalty of the effective thrust force generated by the ARUs is 0.45% and 0.51% in ballast and laden conditions respectively. The speed-power curves showing the calculated net performance gain when operating with the Silverstream System on are given in Figure 5 . Power take-off options to supply power to the compressors and associated equipment were also analysed and included in the savings estimates. Each of the eight certified, oil-free 73 Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021 FIGURE 5 Speed-power curves with the Silverstream System on and off for the Methane Patricia Camila under ballast.FIGURE 4 The net power saving.5,600 5,500 5,400 5,300 5,200 5,100 5,000 14.7 Speed (knots)Shaft power, system on Total power, system on Shaft power, system off Shaft power, system off and without cavity drag 18,000 16,000 14,000 12,000 10,000 8,000 6,000Shaft power (kW) 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 Speed (knots)ALS on ALS offVESSEL AIR LUBRICATION HELPS TO REDUCE MARITIME EMISSIONS compressors was designed to consume 90 kW of power (a total of 720 kW for the ALS). After a review of the available power supply options, the option to take power from the existing forward deck machinery supply was selected. The design work indicated that the compressors should be located in the forward store. Analysis of the requirements for ventilating the forward store based on ambient temperature indicated that two new supply fans and two new exhaust fans were required. The estimated power consumption of each of these supply fans was about 15 kW, so this figure was included in the total net saving estimates. The ALS is controlled from a Silverstream computer in the engine control room. Full integration of the Silverstream control cabinet with the vessel's automation system enables the crew to have complete control of the system from any of the ship's control stations, while any faults with the compressors, the variable-frequency drive and the overboard valves can also be monitored. Vessel data are fed into the ALS through a workstation in the engine control room or on the bridge. These data are used to run the Silverstream System at the correct air flow rate and for performance verification. The communication system between the ALS and the vessel has been designed such that various performance parameters are recorded in the vessel's centralised automation and control system. The ambition is to implement advanced analytical models to optimise the ALS further using the collected performance data. Deployment guidance and risks In engineering terms, the technology is considered simple and does not contain any novel components or components unfamiliar to the maritime world. The construction, installation, commissioning and operation of the technology follow standard shipbuilding and ship operating practices. The technology is adequately addressed by existing regulatory authority and class regulations. Therefore, it does not require additional guidelines, regulations or caveats to be applied when combined with good design and execution. The key technical, commercial, and health, safety and environmental risks are: 1. technical risks: flooding, structural, explosion, electrocution, personal injury and shipyard hazards; 2. project risks: long lead times for critical items such as the compressors and the ARUs; 3. economic risks: fuel prices and IP; 4. commercial and organisational risks: the strategy involving charter periods and the priorities on which projects will be executed (Shell's aim for carbon dioxide emission reduction); 5. operational risks: intake of air bubbles into the lower sea chest and scoop (depending on the type of the vessel), noise and cavitation (none found yet), potential damage to the propeller and hull coatings (none found yet), loss of system control, generator overload, etc.; and 6. policy risks: an upside risk on the impact of the International Maritime Organization 2020 fuel sulphur cap on tightening limits on greenhouse gas emissions in the marine sector. The future Shell Shipping & Maritime has research and development activities planned for the Silverstream System on future voyages in 2021. As well as tests on the system in the laden condition to understand the difference in performance, increasing the air flow rate delivered by the compressors by 15% will Breaking news On 29 April 2021, Shell Shipping & Maritime and Silverstream Technologies were awarded the prestigious Royal Institution of Naval Architects-QinetiQ Maritime Innovation Award for installing the ALS on the Methane Patricia Camila . The award recognises outstanding scientific or technological research in the areas of hydrodynamics, propulsion, structures and material that has the potential to make significant improvements in the design, construction and operation of marine vessels and structures. Shell and Silverstream donated the prize money to The Mission for Seafarers, a charity supporting the well-being and mental health of seafarers worldwide. Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021 74 be assessed, as it is believed that this will improve performance further. Future work will also look at how ALS performance can be combined with Shell's industry-leading hydrodynamics optimisation programme, JAWS, to help understand the optimum draft and trim conditions when using an ALS. The organisation has selected air lubrication technology for its latest LNG carrier new builds currently under construction in South Korea and is looking at further opportunities to deploy this technology across its fleet.Conclusions In engineering terms, the ALS technology is simple and considered low risk, and does not contain any novel components or components unfamiliar to the maritime world. Construction, installation, commissioning and operation of the technology follow standard shipbuilding and ship operational practices. The technology is adequately addressed by existing regulatory authority and class regulations that, when combined with good design and execution, do not then require additional guidelines, regulations or caveats to be applied.

[Ref 1] Shell International BV: \"Decarbonising Digest | 2021DERIVING QUANTIFIABLE VALUE FROM frictionless data access Data can be among Shell's greatest assets, and digitalisation has the potential to unlock value from years of product testing and development. To extract value from structured and unstructured data in multiple formats and locations, a single source of truth is desirable. This challenge requires the ingestion, cleaning, linking and standardisation of different data sources, and making the output available to end-users and applications. Access to the single source of truth could provide measurable value to users, in terms of time efficiency, and to customers, who receive valuable insights. Focusing on such data foundations, the Shell Projects & Technology Lubricants and Fuels Technology organisation established the SPARK frictionless data access (FDA) project. Background: The data-centric organisation Digitalisation is revolutionising everyone's personal and professional lives. COVID-19 has made this apparent: when Shell workers stayed at home because of the pandemic, digitalisation enabled them to continue delivering value to customers. An example of such remote support is the use of RealWear, eyewear that uses the Internet of Things to enable the \"connected worker\", whereby field-based personnel can receive remote assistance from colleagues located anywhere in the world. This technology was used by a grease technology team in a successful plant trial in Derince, Turkey, supported by a team of experts in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK, and for an approval audit of a re-refined base oil manufacturer in China. In the data domain, according to the Shell Projects & Technology Ambition Prospectus (2021), data centricity can unlock incredible value, as decision- makers are empowered by knowledge accumulated through many years of trial and error to achieve various research and development goals. However, to realise this, much back-end work is required to change current processes and ways of working. This entails gathering relevant data; standardising that data; connecting seemingly unconnectable databases, spreadsheets and files; and, most importantly, adapting as a global organisation to pursue digital opportunities. Consumable information can be made available to those involved in product development for providing data-driven business outcomes based on a single source of data truth. The aim is to leverage the power of data and digitalisation to realise its business objectives (see boxed text, The digitalisation vision). Focus: Data foundations The primary focus area for the team has been the data foundations value theme: establishing a single source of data truth. Because data creation is siloed and global in nature, it is difficult to get a single view of all the performance data relating to a product and it is hard to access and analyse historical data. The team's solution was to introduce FDA as a single source of truth for end-to-end product performance data. These data include all current and historic test results and associated formulations from throughout the product development process. To achieve this, the SPARK FDA project was established with the aim of determining standard data sets with established data mastership and providing this to Shell users as a single repository. The problem At present, performance data comprise a mix of structured and unstructured data in multiple formats with no single storage location. This dictates that a considerable amount of manual work is required to create a single view of all formulations and associated test results and compare that with the performance of historical formulations and their test results. As a result, several pain points arise, for example, data from external laboratories not being in an analysable format; being unable to find all the data needed (internally or externally); difficulty in searching through existing data sources for performance data; and problems in querying the data to find the exact information required. A team was therefore set up to investigate the issues and provide a solution. The team identified six business challenges: 1. identifying and cleaning historical structured and unstructured data that are frozen in time; 2. cleaning current structured data; 3. addressing the storage of and access to, as well as the processing and cleaning of ever-growing current, unstructured data volumes; and 4. linking and standardising ingested data through Digest | 2021 76The digitalisation vision A survey of Projects & Technology Lubricants and Fuels Technology that spanned various job roles, regions, products and areas of experience identified data as the organisation's biggest strength and greatest opportunity. The resulting digitalisation vision ( Figure 1 ) addresses the data and digital challenge through five value themes. Data foundations Data foundations require a single source of truth in which data from multiple structured and unstructured sources are ingested, linked, cleaned and standardised. These data are then made available to end-users and applications, thus enabling increased speed of access, improved efficiency, fast learning, data loss prevention and leveraging of best practices. Data analytics and insights The data analytics and insights theme empowers research and development teams to derive insights from the data foundations and make better-informed decisions. End-users are thus enabled to find patterns in data to enable predictions. This could lead to new intellectual property and customer service offerings, and valuable opportunities to demonstrate technology leadership to manufacturing partners and customers. Emerging technologies The emerging technologies value theme utilises exciting upcoming digital technologies such as augmented reality and digital twins to demonstrate Shell products and services and their value to customers in a new light. Digital automation The digital automation value theme involves automating repeatable manual processes to increase output visibility, improve accuracy and save time. This enables a focus on high- value activities. Digital literacy Digital literacy enables colleagues to embrace new ways of working through behavioural change management and role-based digital training to exploit maximum value from digitalisation. \"Unlock the value of data, enable collaboration and power innovation to develop more and cleaner energy solutions for our customers\"Our vision Big dataVirtual experimentation and simulationDigital collaborationto leverage the power of data and digitalisation Grow equipment manufacturer business and technical intimacyGrow and defend Shell-branded businessesEmpower product developmentEnable sustainability transforming how we work, powering growth and sustainability, and enabling new sources of value Data analytics and insightDigital automation Data foundations Emerging technologies Digital literacydelivered through digital value themesOnce these clean and standardised data are available, they must be accessible to end-users and applications through: 5. creating a visualisation layer for end-users; and 6. developing intelligence and automation to run analytics. Addressing these business challenges will not only enable addressing of historical data but also setting up of new processes to prevent the divergence of data. This will lead to new ways of working (Figure 2). SPARK frictionless data access Across the life cycle of any product, performance data are generated at every stage in various structured and unstructured formats. The SPARK FDA project aims to provide a single source of truth for all these test results. The SPARK FDA vision, enabled through a culture of data centricity, is to provide readily available, consumable information that delivers greater insights across the value chain. This will enable decisions to be customer centric and will deliver data-driven, sustainable business outcomes. The SPARK FDA tool provides a single source of truth for cradle-to-grave product performance data. These are visualised through Spotfire, an interactive front end from TIBCO Software Inc. FIGURE 1 A vision for digitalisation. 77 Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021DERIVING QUANTIFIABLE VALUE FROM FRICTIONLESS DATA ACCESS The value of SPARK FDA FDA empowers product development by enabling Shell to quickly and easily access clean, standardised data aggregated from multiple sources, prevent data loss, build experiential intelligence and learn from it. Thus, the organisation accumulates knowledge and experience from the past and implements it today. This goes beyond reducing the need for testing or saving time spent on searching, ingesting, standardising and interpreting data by individuals; it empowers team members to creatively analyse and compare any products, samples or tests from the past. Direct benefits of this include improved, better informed decision- making and, ultimately, enhanced products for use by Shell's customers. For customers, FDA offers a unique way of demonstrating Shell's strong technology leadership by providing them with new insights from which they can directly benefit. FDA also enables Shell to grow and defend its brand through superior product demonstration. Use cases Global automotive manufacturer tender An interesting example use case in which FDA could have been used was to generate technical evidence as part of a tender process for a new motor oil for a global automotive manufacturer. Collecting, extracting, cleaning, linking and analysing the technical data necessary to meet the technical requirements of the global automotive manufacturer took 3.5 d because the data and systems were in China, Japan and the USA. Much of that time was due to the unavailability of data and the use of email for communicating across regions to discover whether the necessary tests had been performed. When the test reports were received, it took a few hours of manual work to copy and paste the values into a consistent format that could be analysed. However, if SPARK FDA was available, it would have taken only a few minutes to scope out the tests of interest in a format fit for analytical purposes. Hence, a product developer could have almost instantly performed a deep dive into an analysis of interest, thus resulting in a time saving of 80-90% (Figure 3). SPARK FDA also encourages product developers to creatively query data in ways that may result in unexpected correlations. In addition, FDA could demonstrate strong technology leadership in digital technologies for stakeholders and customers. With FDA, regardless of businesses' physical locations and different ways of working, a standardised and integrated approach to data can be achieved. Consequently, scientists can perform ad hoc experimental analyses on an unprecedented scale using available data to leverage previously generated knowledge to enhance product performance. Third-party testing Test reports are currently received in PDF format via individual requestor emails from the third- party test houses. This leads to lack of visibility of the test results to a wider user base and an inability to easily analyse the reports because of their format. To address this challenge, the team, in collaboration with contracts and procurement, is working with the third-party test houses to standardise and streamline new data and route them to a centralised storage location in a readable format. If it is not possible to obtain data including test reports from external test vendors in agreed formats, for example, text files and spreadsheets, advanced digital technologies such Intelligence and automation Automatically suggest recommendations based on selected components and queryHistorical data A nite exercise to clean up all legacy data within structured and unstructured data sources to be included in the search and visualisation layers of the toolStructured data Link and standardise This exercise ensures that all data sources ingested are standardised and linked together through specic metadata to provide product owners with valuable business insights Unstructured dataVisualisation layer Provides users a visual representation of data sets and enables them to easily sort, lter and combine different attributesUnstructuredClean and process live and current structured data Storage and access Process and cleanStructured FIGURE 2 Business challenges for FDA. Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021 78as natural language processing will be used to extract the relevant information. Laboratory data storage Another example of a new process is determining how to access information on those laboratory computers that require the use of flash drives to extract data. This is an inefficient way of working, so, because of the inherent data security risk and the difficulty of data access, addressing this issue is a priority. As a result, a cloud-based laboratory data storage (LDS) solution will be deployed for computers on the Shell network ( Figure 4 ). The advantages of LDS are the single versions of data sets stored in one cloud location and thus readily accessible to colleagues around the globe, and the convenient end-user experience; LDS is a mapped network drive on users' computers that have the necessary security measures. The SPARK FDA team Unlocking multiple years of accumulated information, data and knowledge from multiple structured and unstructured sources into a single integrated, standardised and consistent environment is a challenging task. With a strong focus on data governance and ownership, a diverse team was assembled to leverage the \"power of us\". This team included subject matter experts, Shell IT experts (programme manager, business analysts, data product manager, communications manager, software developers, user interface and experience developers, data architects, data scientists and information risk management colleagues) and external vendor members from Wipro. The team is successfully addressing the identified challenges through an agile, problem-focused approach prioritising high-value activities. The diversity in skill sets and business representation is one of the main reasons behind generating an assortment of ideas, developing a creative troubleshooting approach and maturing the ideas into valuable outcomes. Each business has a slightly different approach, which enables the team to rapidly learn from each other's experiences. Furthermore, each business has its own initiatives and, owing to the wide scope of SPARK FDA, the team can link up with those that fit its purpose. This means that the efforts of other teams directly benefit SPARK FDA and vice versa. One more great strength is that the team consists of diverse individuals based across three continents and in several countries, including India, the Netherlands, the UK and the USA. Culturally, it is even more diverse, which is one of the main FIGURE 3 SPARK FDA in action: (a) SPARK FDA Spotfire dashboard, (b) quickly compare multiple different formulations and associated test performance, (c) plot multiple parameters, visualise results and make quick decisions on next steps, and (d) plot parameters and query and manipulate the data in different ways. a b c d 79 Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021contributors to the group's openness. The thoughts and opinions of each individual are embraced and do not go unnoticed. External partner for unstructured data Large amounts of information and knowledge stored in test report documents (unstructured data) need to be integrated into the database (structured data). The team reviewed the capabilities of and tools available from about 50 vendors and identified Wipro as the vendor of choice after a detailed assessment. Wipro will use its in-house developed solution Digital Chrysalis, which uses advanced artificial intelligence algorithms that it has refined over several years to identify and extract the required test data by crawling the unstructured documents and writing this data into the structured SPARK database. This will enable access to a large set of test data in a single location. Having access to all the data at users' fingertips will enable data analytics for identifying trends and patterns to predict future behaviour. This will provide additional insights, facilitate more efficient and accurate decision making and be a game changer for Shell. Solution benefits and the path forward Once data are acquired, the team can begin building knowledge graphs to help in holistic understanding. The graphs can be combined with other relevant data, such as manufacturer limits, which would help product developers tremendously because these can be used as criteria to inform their searches. Algorithms and logic developed for other tools within Shell could also be used once the data foundation is set. Collaborating with other projects and initiatives in the Projects & Technology space and beyond gives Shell an advantage by increasing the number of use cases and users. Ultimately, this will enable capabilities that are essential in today's data-driven external environment. As an example, machine learning is used to consider blends and test results from the past and predict test results for future formulations. This is currently being worked on in the SPARK subproject Dexter. A step further is not only to predict test results for given components but also to reverse this and predict which formulations would satisfy given criteria, for example, based on multiple test results. The team's current primary objective is to ensure that SPARK FDA is scalable for future use cases. A key focus item is guaranteeing that the data foundation is fit for both today and tomorrow's purposes. This is a major task that involves subject matter experts for various product families, regions and roles sharing their knowledge, ways of working and preferences. Additional functionalities, such as predictive capabilities, are being developed as the project progresses.

However, a large proportion of this waste is biodegradable food waste that could be transformed into biogas. Food waste is a major constituent of municipal solid wastes and its accumulation or disposal in landfills is problematic and causing environmental issues. An experimental and theoretical techno-economic study has investigated the potential for biogas production from different types of food waste generated at PDO and using it to replace liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking purposes. If the results of this work are implemented, they will add value to the renewable energy and solid waste management sectors and benefit PDO. Why a biogas plant is a good idea Having a biogas plant at an industrial facility is a good idea from the environmental, energy and knowledge viewpoints: In addition to the possibility of generating revenue, implementing a biogas facility will divert waste from landfill and thus help to minimise its environmental impact and any soil contamination. Biogas can be used continuously to produce clean energy and thus can be a stable, reliable, on-demand source of energy; it generates no net carbon dioxide because the microorganisms convert and use the carbon dioxide as they grow. Setting up a biogas plant at an industrial facility will improve workers' knowledge of waste management. The creation of a knowledgeable workforce will facilitate the design and application of new sustainable ideas within industry. Such a project will also help in meeting three of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals: affordable and clean energy; life on land; and climate action. A biogas plant would help PDO in fulfilling its environmental obligations by reducing its fossil-fuel energy consumption while helping to meet increasing energy demand and enhancing its waste management strategy. In addition, PDO's reputation in society and industry will improve and new industry and job opportunities will be created in Oman. The challenge High population growth and uncontrolled urbanisation are creating critical problems with solid waste disposal. Food waste is usually a major portion of any municipal solid waste that is commonly disposed of in landfills. However, landfilling is expensive, requires space and can have negative environmental impacts if not well managed owing to the production of leachate, methane and carbon dioxide, and nuisances such as flies, odours and vermin. Leachate can pollute underground water and soil, and release methane, a potent greenhouse gas with a short-term global warming potential. Using food waste as a source for producing sustainable fuels would complete the full cycle of this waste stream sustainably and, thus, directly support and facilitate the concept of the circular economy in the form of open-loop recycling. One promising way of dealing with such waste streams is by processing them through anaerobic digestion to produce biogas. Anaerobic digestion is a series of processes in which microorganisms break down biodegradable material in the absence of oxygen to manage waste and/or to release energy. Biogas is mainly methane and carbon dioxide, with traces of gases such as hydrogen sulphide, ammonia and water vapour. It has a variety of uses. PDO's statistics on the amount of food waste produced by its different clusters show that the company generates about 7 t each month The start of the process. Much of the canteen waste from PDO's kitchens is biodegradable and could be transformed into biogas.GROWTH Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021 82(Table 1 ). Fahud is one of the largest PDO clusters. It has a monthly workforce of about 17 ,000 and produces the highest volume of food waste. The current disposal method for food waste at Fahud is dumping it in an open trench. However, some of the negative impacts are of this clearly noticeable during a site visit: bad odours, visible rubbish and birds and flies scavenging for food. Consequently, a technical and commercial evaluation was conducted to investigate the potential for biogas production from the different types of food waste produced at Fahud camp [Ref 1] . Methodology Various leftover food waste samples were collected from the camp, including two types of mixed food (fruit and vegetables), bread, potato peel, meat, rice, dates, beans, leafy vegetables and fish (Figure 1 ). Then an anaerobic digestion experiment was performed at Sultan Qaboos University, Oman. First, the dry matter and the nutrient composition in each food waste sample were measured. Then the in-vitro true digestibility gas production was investigated to calculate the amount of gas produced from each sample. Finally, a techno- economic study on biogas production from food waste was undertaken. Calibrated 100-ml glass syringes were used to measure the gas produced by fermentation over 21 d. The syringes contained 200 mg of feed and about 30 ml of rumen liquor and artificial saliva mixture. The plunger was used to slowly push all the excess air out of the syringe. Then the nozzle was sealed with a clip and the syringes were placed in a water bath at 39\u00baC ( Figure 2 ). Readings of the plunger levels were taken at 0, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 h, and then daily for 21 d. The methane concentration in the headspace gas produced was measured using gas chromatography. Test results Characterisation results The water content in food waste varies widely depending on the food source and, in some TABLE 1 PDO food waste analysis.

Therefore, measuring the moisture content of each food waste sample was crucial when calculating the total quantities of biogas produced and the nutrient content of each sample. To establish a relationship between biogas production performance and biochemical components, proximate analysis (quantitative analysis of the macromolecules) was performed on the samples on a dry basis and in duplicate for data reproducibility. Table 2 shows the dry matter content and proximate analysis results for the samples studied. Biogas production Figure 3 shows the main outcomes of the tests. The biogas formation rate increased with a higher carbohydrate content and a lower fat content in the samples, i.e., dates produced the most gas. The sample with the highest fat content, fish waste, had the lowest potential for biogas production because the complexity of the fat compounds required a longer residence time for degradation and biogas formation. The sample with the highest protein content, the meat sample, also had a low potential for biogas production because the ammonia released during the degradation of protein increases the pH in the system and thus decreases the biodegradation rate by inhibiting the microorganisms. In summary, for a better biogas production rate, high carbohydrate and low fat and protein contents are required. Thus, the samples of dates, rice waste, beans and mixed food waste possessed the greatest potential for high biogas production. The biogas production along with its methane concentration over 21 d is shown in Figure 4 for selected waste samples: dates, rice, beans and mixed food. Overall, for each sample, there was a daily increase in the accumulated produced biogas. At Day 21, the highest gas production was from the rice and mixed food waste samples at 1,600 and 1,550 ml/g of dry matter respectively. The profiles show fluctuations in the methane concentration for all samples because of the:TABLE 2 Proximate and dry matter analysis.FIGURE 2 An anaerobic digester used in the 1 1.45 2.18 1.97 12.33 1.13 10.41 2 7. 5 Fruit and vegetables1.62 1.72 0.42 2.65 0.30 13.33 19.6 Bread 0.65 1.03 1.85 11.30 9.07 55.15 7. 2 Potato peel 1.49 1.62 1.62 10.13 2.81 10.05 26.1 Mixed food 2 1.62 0.92 5.78 2.07 14.68 25.5 Meat 0.23 1.14 6.04 37. 74 0.51 3.48 43.1 Rice 0.28 0.74 1.64 10.27 0.23 26.28 8 Dates Beans 2.49 1.63 1.86 11.62 23.07 39.4 Leafy vegetables 4.51 5.16 1.65 10.30 0.83 14.70 35.5 Fish 0.20 6.35 2.87 17.9 2 4.08 3.15 31.7 large fluctuations in the population levels of methanogenic bacteria as volatile fatty acids accumulated and were subsequently consumed; different digestion processes taking place during the incubation period that resulted in pH changes: microorganism growth throughout anaerobic digestion is influenced by variations in pH, as each bacteria type has a specific pH range for activity; temperature fluctuations in the digester affecting the type and population of the microorganisms: temperature changes inside the incubator were caused by the external conditions and microbial activity; and nutrient content (i.e., composition) of the feedstock affecting the amount and dynamics of the biogas produced. Economic evaluation and conclusion A study was then performed to evaluate the economic feasibility of installing an anaerobic digester unit to process the food waste Fahud camp produces. The idea was to replace LPG used as fuel for cooking with biogas to achieve cost savings. It is important to note that processing food waste in a larger-scale plant would reduce the overall cost through economies of scale. This could be achieved by centralised food waste collection and processing. The estimated biogas production rate used was based on the value determined from the anaerobic digestion experiment. The economic analysis used a discounted cash flow approach whereby projected future cash flows are discounted at a rate that represents the cost of capital. The analysis included identifying the discounted payback period ( DPP ) and the net present value ( NPV ): [Eq 1] FIGURE 4 The total gas production profiles and methane production over 21 d for waste samples of (a) dates, (b) rice, (c) beans and (d) mixed food.FIGURE 3 The total biogas production rate. 85 Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021450 400 350 300 250 200 150 100 50 0Total gas (ml/g of dry matter) Mixed food 1Bread Potato peelMixed food 2MeatRice DateBeans Leafy vegetablesFish waste Fruit and vegetables 1,200 1,000 800 600 400 200 0 2468101214 Time (d)1618 212060 50 40 30 20 10 0Total gas (ml/g of dry matter)Methane (%)1,800 1,600 1,400 1,200 1,000 800 600 400 200 0 2468101214 Time (d)1618 212070 60 50 40 30 20 10 0Total gas (ml/g of dry matter)Methane (%) 1,400 1,200 1,000 800 600 400 200 0 2468101214 Time (d)1618 212070 60 50 40 30 20 10 0Total gas (ml/g of dry matter)Methane (%)1,800 1,600 1,400 1,200 1,000 800 600 400 200 0 2468101214 Time (d)1618 212035 30 25 20 15 10 5 0Total gas (ml/g of dry matter)Methane (%)a b c d Gas production Methane ASSESSING THE VIABILITY OF BIOGAS PRODUCTION FROM FOOD WASTE AUTHOR Abeer Al-Wahaibi is a senior energy management engineer at PDO and is passionate about the energy transition and climate actions. She joined PDO as a process engineer in 2012 after two years working for Halliburton as a drilling fluid engineer. Abeer has a master's degree in chemical and process engineering from Sultan Qaboos University. [Eq 2] where I = initial investment; r = discount rate; and CF = cash flow. Most of the LPG prices investigated [Ref 1] indicated that value would be created through an anaerobic digestion project at Fahud camp, as they all had a positive NPV , although the payback periods varied. For the project to break even, i.e., an NPV of 0, an LPG price of about $0.29/m3 would be required. Any investment in a Fahud biogas production plant should be carefully considered using current and anticipated LPG prices. The annual cash flows used in the analysis were based on LPG savings only. Incorporating any waste management fee savings would increase the total savings. Furthermore, the potential amount of biogas could replace about 28.6% of the LPG Fahud camp currently uses for cooking purposes. However, a life-cycle assessment should be carried out to evaluate and ensure the environmental sustainability of such a process, as there are also drawbacks associated with biogas production, including possible greenhouse gas emissions due to ineffective handling within the process. It is worth noting that food waste could be used for producing value-added chemicals such as carboxylic acids, which might be a better value proposition. However, an additional benefit from anaerobic digestion is the process's residue. This is rich in nutrients and has value as a soil fertiliser for agricultural purposes. All the types of food waste used in this study showed the potential for biogas production through anaerobic digestion. However, the amount of biogas produced and its methane concentration depended on the nature of the food waste sample. Recommendations Although aerobic digestion is a promising technology for producing renewable energy in the form of biogas for purposes such as cooking, it is recommended that an economic evaluation for this option be undertaken. Before processing food waste in an anaerobic digester, pretreatment options such as sorting, drying and heating to enhance the performance of the digestion process should be evaluated. In addition, the anaerobic digestion should be run under conditions suitable for methanogenesis to increase the methane concentration in the produced biogas.

The next-generation, carbon-neutral Shell Gadus grease portfolio, including Shell Gadus S5 V110KP 1 for wind turbine bearings, is one way Shell is playing its part. High-performance greases help to maintain turbine efficiency and reliability in ever more challenging operating conditions and for ever more sophisticated and larger turbines. After laboratory tests and two years of field trials, Shell has won the approval of a major Chinese turbine manufacturer for the use of Shell Gadus S5 V110KP 1 in blade and yaw bearings. Wind turbine lubrication requirements Wind turbines represent a challenging application for lubrication because of the remoteness of wind farms, the tower heights, the ambient operating conditions and the loads and vibrations to which their components are exposed. The installed wind turbine fleet continues to face reliability challenges and new, multimegawatt wind turbine designs with larger blade diameters and tower heights, increased pitch control and a greater focus on offshore siting continue to impose new challenges for bearing and lubricant manufacturers alike. Developing greases for wind turbine bearing lubrication ( Figure 1 ) requires an understanding of the design and typical failure modes of the bearings, the ambient operating temperatures, the servicing frequency, the method of lubricant application and the compatibility of factory-fill lubricants with service-fill greases, among other factors. All these are key to providing long turbine service life, efficiency and reliability for wind farm operators. There are currently two approaches to developing greases for main shaft, blade/pitch, yaw and generator bearings: multipurpose greases suitable for lubricating all applications and greases for each specific application. Each approach has its pros and cons, and the FIGURE 1 Wind turbine lubricating points.Wind turbines must be reliable to play their part in reducing global carbon emissions.GROWTH 13 4 2Shell Gadus S5 V110KP 1 1.

Main shaft bearing 87 Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021 balance between ultimate bearing reliability and ease of use and ordering for service technicians must be considered carefully. Adjusting the blade angles of a wind turbine is important for safe operation, especially in high winds, and to control the power output of the turbine. Adjusting the blades is done via blade (or pitch) bearings, which are slewing rings: typically double-raced, four-point-contact ball bearings bolted to the blade hub. Such bearings are exposed to very high dynamic loads from the blades. There is also significant vibration and minimal rotation of the rolling elements in the bearing. Vibration and minor oscillations can result in a major failure mode, false brinelling. Newer wind turbine designs involve more active pitching. Consequently, these bearings require specialised greases designed to overcome multiple lubrication challenges. Building on the success of Shell Rhodina BBZ grease, which is used by many wind turbine operators worldwide, Shell has recently developed a new high-performance, synthetic blade bearing grease: Shell Gadus S5 V110KP 1. This grease has been formulated with all the various challenges in mind and, through the judicious selection of synthetic base fluid, thickener and additive combinations, it is a grease with advanced corrosion and fretting wear protection, high load-carrying capacity and exceptional low- temperature pumpability. This product builds on experience in the wind and aviation industries to help satisfy the demands of today's active pitching systems for multimegawatt wind turbines operating in on- and offshore environments. Highly variable operating temperatures Irrespective of the lubricant type in a wind turbine, whether it be main gearbox oil, hydraulic fluid or grease, one of the most critical properties is the lubricant's ability to function over a wide operating temperature range, from arctic conditions to high ambient temperatures. Temperatures ranging from below 40 to above 50\u00b0C are not uncommon and there are often wide seasonal and daily swings. It is typical for today's wind turbine designs to have centralised greasing systems ( Figure 2 ) of the progressive or single-line type with narrow- diameter feed lines that distribute the grease to the lubrication points, which necessitate greases with excellent low-temperature pumpability. In test (DIN 51805), Shell Gadus S5 V110KP grease shows superior flowability. This test determines the pressure required to force grease out of a test nozzle in a continuous stream. Ideally, this pressure remains low, below 1,400 mbar, at low ambient temperatures. Shell Gadus S5 V110KP 1 grease had flow-pressure values at -45\u00b0C and <1,400 mbar at -50\u00b0C. Wet, corrosive environments Wind farms are often in coastal areas and increasingly offshore, which results in an increased potential for (salt) water ingress. As a result, greases for wind turbine lubrication must have excellent rust and corrosion resistance, even in a corrosive saltwater environment. The SKF Emcor test (ASTM D6138: Standard test method for determination of corrosion-preventive properties of lubricating greases under dynamic wet conditions) is an industry-standard test used to determine the anticorrosion properties of greases in contact with a double row of self- aligning ball bearings when exposed to water of varying quality. At the end of the test, the bearing raceways are examined and the degree of corrosion is rated against a defined scale, with 0 being no corrosion and 5 representing heavy corrosion, i.e., corroded areas cover more than 10% of the running track surface. When tested with distilled water, Shell Gadus S5 V110KP 1 grease has a rating of 0 ( Figure 3 ); with synthetic seawater, its rating is 1 or less, which is indicative of its advanced corrosion prevention properties. Long life Although the temperatures to which the greases in a wind turbine are exposed are not the highest in industry, long grease life is a feature that wind FIGURE 2 A wind turbine's central lubrication system.

Consequently, Shell Gadus S5 V110KP 1 grease has been formulated with synthetic base oils instead of mineral oils for performance benefits including extended oil life (oxidation stability), improved low-temperature pumpability and improved wear protection at higher operating temperatures, thanks to its lower friction coefficient. Wear protection Because blade bearings are subjected to significant vibration and minimal rotation of the bearing members, a common failure mode is fretting wear or false brinelling, a wear mechanism that can be addressed through careful grease design. This wear results from very slow and infrequent oscillation: motion that is insufficient to enable or promote the formation of an effective lubricating film between the rolling members and raceway. Shell Gadus S5 V110KP 1 grease has been designed to help provide increased resistance to false brinelling and to help prevent wear at the rolling contacts, even under high and variable load conditions. The ability of Shell Gadus S5 V110KP 1 grease to meet wear challenges has been fully validated in the laboratory in a variety of tests. One of the world's leading manufacturers of blade bearings for wind turbines, Rothe Erde, specifies that greases for use in its blade bearings must pass the Rothe Erde/IME ripple and corrosion test. This test was developed by the Institut f\u00fcr Maschinenelemente und Maschinengestaltung, Aachen University, Germany, to evaluate the performance of blade bearing greases and Shell Gadus S5 V110KP 1Grease A Grease B Grease CFIGURE 4 Bearing surface evaluation after the modified ripple test.

The test grease is packed into a FAG four-point contact roller bearing through which 1% sodium chloride solution is passed, and the bearing is then cycled through one million cycles of an alternating 70-kN axial load. At the end of the test, the bearings are removed and the ripple depth on the bearing raceway is measured. In addition, the corrosion is visually assessed and rated on a scale of 1 to 5. Shell Gadus S5 V110KP 1 grease had a maximum ripple depth of 2 m, a mean ripple depth of <1 m and a corrosion rating of 1, which all indicate its advanced protection against this wear mechanism. To evaluate the grease under more severe conditions, it was subjected to a modified ripple test at the Technical University of Clausthal, Germany, again using a FAG four-point-contact roller bearing. The test conditions included a 1% sodium chloride solution and running the bearing for one million cycles at a 3,000-MPa surface pressure and a 7-Hz pivoting movement frequency. Figure 4 shows the results for Shell Gadus S5 V110KP 1 (minimal damage) and three over competitors' greases Shell Gadus S5 V110KP 1 has also been benchmarked against the most common competing greases, all from well-known international suppliers (Figure 5 ). The results show that its formulation provides the bearing protection wind farm operators are looking for. Benchmarking against competitors' greases shows that Shell Gadus S5 V110KP 1 offers: better false brinelling and fretting damage protection, as it creates an effective protective layer for blade bearings operating under high loads; better low-speed protection to help reduce operating wear and prolong bearing life; better corrosion resistance, as it maintains a stable film against water ingress; andFIGURE 7 Grease behaviour and distribution in the bearing.

Wind turbine field trial To demonstrate that Shell Gadus S5 V110KP 1 could meet the requirements of a leading Chinese wind turbine manufacturer, a field trial was undertaken to compare its performance against the main player (50% share) in the local Chinese market. The key measure was the iron content, i.e., wear metal, in used grease. The data had to convince the manufacturer that the overall protection performance of Shell Gadus S5 V110KP 1 was at least as good as, and preferably better than, the competitor's grease. The manufacturer provided three new turbines (each with three blade bearings) in which to trial each grease. All six turbines were at the same wind farm to ensure the same operating conditions. One role of bearing grease, as with other lubricants, is to keep wear particles in suspension to prevent additional damage and discharge out the wear particles to realise the bearing \"metabolism\"; in this case, to keep the wear particles from settling in the bearing raceway. This means that the grease goes black over time. However, the sampling and iron analyses over the two-year test revealed that it was difficult to obtain repeatable and reproducible results with the competitor's grease: the iron contents in these grease samples fluctuated widely. See Figure 6 for example results. Statistical analysis of all the test data for the competitor's grease revealed failures on repeatability and reproducibility, which are important for meaningful tests. Thus, it was felt that the data were unreliable and did not reflect realistic bearing conditions to facilitate a comparison. The question was why? The answer is uneven sampling caused by the poor flowability of the competitor's grease ( Figure 7 ). The grease was always taken from the same sampling point, but poor flowability meant it was very easy to sample fresh grease or subfresh grease rather than used grease, which distorted the analysis and did not provide feedback on the running state of the bearing. The sample appearance comparisons ( Figure 8 ) for July and September show the inconsistency of the competitor's used grease samples; they should be more uniform in colour. The penetration values of the used grease samples were then assessed to determine their flowability. Shell Gadus S5 V110KP 1 had considerably higher penetration values, which means that it was softer than the competitor's grease and flowed easily in the bearings. Soft grease helps to take the wear particles away from the raceway and decreases the pressure on the bearing seal. Poor flowability makes grease gather on the bearing seal side and causes a weak interaction between the sealing side and the raceway, thus wear particles Project Bridge Project Bridge focuses on speeding up product approvals from leading Chinese wind turbine equipment manufacturers and reinforcing Shell's number-one position in the wind power sector. To achieve this goal, an action plan has been identified and an agile team and ways of working between global and local organisations have been established. Project Bridge provided tremendous support by guaranteeing the resources for an agile team to perform the necessary sprints. It also enabled quicker and closer collaboration with the wind turbine manufacturer. The technical team, the grease business development team and the key account manager jointly conducted 5 on-site service visits and 10 customer visits, held seminars and published 18 technical articles. Through this project, Shell has accumulated a large volume of first-hand data that will benefit future equipment manufacturer approval projects.Shell S5 V110 KP Good flowability Competitor's grease Poor flowability Reliable testing data Equipment maintenance Distorted testing data Grease distributes uniformly in the bearing, so it is easier to discharge wear particles.

This means that the iron content is dependent on the amount of interaction between the grease at the raceway and the grease on the sealing side. Conclusions Grease with good flowability will take the wear particles out of the raceways of wind turbine blade bearings and help to prolong bearing life. The conclusions concerning the importance of good grease flowability ( Figure 9 ) revealed by the field trials and the results of the laboratory tests enabled Shell to convince the leading Chinese wind turbine manufacturer to approve the use of Shell Gadus S5 V110KP 1 for blade and yaw bearings.

What interests you most about the work that you've recently been doing for Shell? As a society, we need to change the way we produce and use energy. Our future must be much less dependent on fossil fuels. I am leading a research centre that is 100% committed to supporting this energy transition, which is fully aligned with Shell's strategy. This fact gives me motivation and the confidence that we are on the right path. I am really excited to be part of it. What aspect of that work in particular do you think Shell should learn more about - and why? It is relatively simple to produce, process and sell crude oil commercially, as it is a commodity with clear global price indexes and regulations. But energy in a wider sense is different. The new energies businesses that are springing up around the globe represent a paradigm shift for big energy companies. Every region has its own policies and local requirements, so it is vital to get a better understanding of those socio-political ecosystems. In the context of a fundamental research centre like mine, it is crucial to envisage the trends in the Brazilian community, and to consider the main opportunities and risks. They will certainly steer the work of my centre's partnership with Shell. I also consider that this is a shared challenge, between Shell and us in academia. We must adapt to different ways of working and adopt the right mindset to maintain our position as a valuable research and development partner for Shell. In your dealings with Shell, what aspect of the company has surprised you most? Over almost three years of collaboration with Shell, one aspect that still surprises me is the depth of commitment that Shell professionals have to the goals and vision of their company. Shell has some brilliant minds ready to offer assistance and guidance for the energy transition. This reinforces my belief that I made the right choice when I decided to work in partnership with Shell. 93 Shell TechXplorer Digest | 2021Shell TechXplorer Digest | 202194 Shell TechXplorer Digest - 2021\u00a9 2021 Shell Global Solutions International B.V.
