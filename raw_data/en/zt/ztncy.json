On average, people are more frequently diag - nosed with IBD between the ages of 15 and 35, although the disease can occur at any age. The number of IBD patients has significantly increased over the last 50 years. While multi- ple contributing factors have been found, the exact cause of these diseases is unknown and currently there are no cures for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. This makes the role of the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation in supporting research so critical. The Foundation has pio-neered the research of these difficult to under - stand digestive diseases for over a half-century. Some of our major projects include our Genetics Initiative (research studies focused on the genes associated with IBD), Microbiome Initiative (studying bacterial, viral, and fungal species that reside in the gut and can affect the course of disease), and Environmental Triggers Initiative (research into the impact of lifestyle, psychological stress, nutrition, and other exter - nal factors). About Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis belong to a group of conditions known as inflamma-tory bowel diseases, or IBD. These disorders affect the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, the area of the body where digestion takes place. As the name implies, these diseases cause inflam-mation of the intestine. When a part of the body is inflamed, it becomes swollen. Sores, or ulcers, may also form within the walls of the intestine. The ongoing inflammation leads to symptoms that may already be familiar to you: abdominal pain, cramping, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, and fatigue. For some people, their symptoms are not just restricted to the GI tract. They may experience signs of IBD in other parts of the body, such as the eyes, joints, skin, bones, kidneys, and liver. These are referred to as extraintestinal complications of IBD, because they occur outside of the intestine. Although Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis share a lot of symptoms, they do have some marked differences. While inflammation re-lated to Crohn's disease may involve any part of the GI tract from the mouth to the anus (including the esophagus, stomach, small in-testine, and large intestine), ulcerative colitis is limited to just the large intestine (including the colon and rectum). Another distinguishing feature of ulcerative colitis is that it starts in the rectum and extends from there in a contin-uous area of inflammation. In contrast, Crohn's disease may appear in \"patches,\" affecting some areas of the GI tract while leaving other sections in between completely untouched. These are known as \"skip\" areas. These dif - ferences are important for deciding whether inflammation of the intestinal tract is from Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. In 10 per - cent of cases there are overlapping features THE GASTROINTESTINAL (GI) TRACT Oral Cavity (mouth) Esophagus (throat)LiverStomachLarge Intestine/ColonSmall IntestineRectumAnus1 2 3 4 5 6 7 81 2 34 5 6 7 84 5 Medications can be given in oral form (by mouth), intravenously (through a vein), or subcutaneously (by injection under the skin). Topical therapies are administered rectally, as suppositories, enemas, creams, and ointments. A person's therapeutic needs may change over time. What works at one point during the disease may not be effective during another stage. It is important for the patient and doctor to thoroughly discuss which course of therapy is best, balancing the bene-fits and risks of each treatment option. With the right treatment, patients may pos-sibly achieve a life with minimal symptoms. Patients should have an open dialogue with their doctor and inform them if they are still experiencing IBD symptoms or a change in symptoms while on treatment. During these discussions, patients should feel comfortable asking their doctor about other available treatment options. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Medications Prescription medications reduce intestinal inflammation and form the core of IBD treat - ments. Even so, these important prescription medications may not eliminate all of your symptoms. Naturally, you may want to take over-the-counter medications in an effort to feel better. Before doing so, speak with your doctor, as sometimes these symptoms may indicate a worsening of the inflammation that may require a change in your prescription. Other times these symptoms do not reflect a worsening of the condition and can be treated with over-the-counter medications. For exam-ple, your doctor may recommend loperamide (Imodium \u00ae) to relieve diarrhea, or anti-gas products for bloating. To reduce joint pain or fever, your doctor may recommend acetamino- phen (Tylenol\u00ae) or non-steroidal anti-inflamma- tory drugs (NSAID)\u2014such as aspirin, ibuprofen Treatment To date, there is no known cause of or cures for IBD, but fortunately there are many effec - tive treatments to help control the symptoms of these diseases. The two main goals of treat - ments for IBD are: Achieving remission (defined as the absence of symptoms) Maintaining remission (defined as preventing flare-ups of disease) These goals may be achieved with a combi-nation of over-the-counter and prescription medications or surgery, depending on each individual case. For more on surgery, visit www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org. When considering medication options, it is im- portant to work together with your provider to make the best choice of treatment that aligns with your personal goals and preferences. Please keep in mind the following: Symptoms of these long-term diseases may range from mild to severe and may include, but are not limited to, diarrhea, abdominal cramping, nausea, pain, rectal bleeding, and fever. People will go through periods in which the illness is active and is flaring. These episodes are usually followed by times of remission. Remission occurs when symptoms either dis-appear completely or lessen considerably and good health returns. These remission periods can last months or even years. Because each person with IBD is different, the treatment used to control his or her ill-ness is unique. Doctors will customize treat - ment to the individual's needs based on the type and severity of symptoms. Medications may be given in different dosages, formula-tions, and for different lengths of time.6 7 tally, or intravenously. They are effective for short-term control of disease activity (flares); however, they are not recommend-ed for long-term or maintenance use be-cause of their side effects such as swelling, weight gain, hair growth, and acne. Long-term steroid use can also lead to weakened bones (osteoporosis). If you cannot come off steroids without a relapse of symptoms, your doctor may add some other medications to help manage your disease. It is important not to suddenly stop taking this medication. If you stop suddenly, you may experience symptoms such as severe fatigue, weakness, body aches, joint pain, nausea, or a decrease in appetite. Immunomodulators: These include azathio-prine, 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), methotrex - ate, cyclosporine, and tacrolimus. This class of medications modifies the body's immune system so that it cannot cause ongoing inflammation. Usually given orally (metho-trexate can also be injectable), immunomod-ulators are typically used in people for whom aminosalicylates and corticosteroids haven't been effective, or have been only partially effective. They may be useful in reducing or eliminating reliance on corticosteroids. They also may be effective in maintaining remission in people who haven't responded to other medications given for this purpose. Immuno-modulators may take up to three months to begin working. All patients on immunomod-ulators need to be monitored closely for side effects, such as bone marrow problems as well as irritation of the liver or pancreas.(Motrin, \u00ae Advil\u00ae), or naproxen (Aleve\u00ae). NSAIDs will work to alleviate joint symptoms but can irritate the GI tract, thus promoting inflamma-tion. NSAIDs should be used with great care. Make sure that you follow instructions with all OTC products, but again, speak with your healthcare professional before you take any of these medications. Prescription Medications Some medications used to treat Crohn's dis- ease and ulcerative colitis have been around for years. Others are more recent break - throughs. The most commonly prescribed medications fall into the following categories: Aminosalicylates: These include medications that contain 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) such as sulfasalazine, balsalazide, mesal-amine, and olsalazine. These medications work by inhibiting certain pathways that produce substances that cause inflamma-tion. They can work at the level of the lining of the GI tract to decrease inflammation. They are thought to be effective in treating mild-to-moderate episodes of IBD, and are useful as a maintenance treatment in pre-venting relapses of the disease. They work best in the colon and are not particularly effective if the disease is limited to the small intestine. These are often given orally in the form of delayed release tablets to target the colon, or rectally as enemas or suppositories. Corticosteroids: These medications, prednisolone, meth-ylprednisolone, and budesonide, affect the body's ability to begin and maintain an inflammatory process. In addition, they work to keep the immune system in check. Pred-nisone and prednisolone are used for people with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Budesonide is used for mild-to-moderate ileal Crohn's disease, and right-sided colon Crohn's dis-ease. They can be administered orally, rec -8 9 Janus kinase inhibitors (JAK Inhibitors): These medications, currently available as tablets, are broken down in the gastrointes-tinal tract after ingestion and are directly ab-sorbed into the bloodstream via the intestinal wall. Due to the small size of these chemical - ly active substances, they can be transported through the bloodstream to nearly any site in the body, including the immune system. Unlike some of the other tablet-based agents like thiopurines and methotrexate, these agents work more quickly and can induce and maintain remission. Tofacitinib is the first JAK inhibitor approved to treat ulcerative colitis. Off-Label Sometimes doctors will prescribe medications that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA ) has not specifically approved for the treatment of Crohn's or ulcerative colitis. Nonetheless, these medications have been shown to be very effective in reducing symptoms. Prescribing medications for other than FDA-approved con-ditions is known as \"off-label\" use. Your health-care provider may have to obtain prior approval from insurance companies before prescribing a medication for off-label use. Patients should be aware that they or their doctor might need to make a special appeal in order for their insur - ance company to pay for an off-label medication. Complementary and alternative therapies Some people living with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis look toward complementary and alternative medi cines ( CAM) to use togeth - er with conventional therapies to help ease their symptoms. CAM therapies may work in a variety of ways. They may help to control symptoms and ease pain, enhance feelings of well-being and quality of life, and possibly boost the im - mune system. Speak with your doctor about the best thera pies f or your situation. Biologic therapies: These therapies are bio- engineered drugs that target very specif - ic molecules involved in the inflammatory process. These are not drugs but antibodies (types of proteins) that target the action of other proteins that cause inflammation. These medications are indicated for people with moderately to severely active disease. They also are effective for reducing fistulas. Fistulas, which may occur with Crohn's dis-ease, are small tunnels connecting the intes-tine to another area of the body to which it is not usually connected. Biologics may be an effective strategy for reducing steroid use, as well as for maintain-ing remission. While on biologics, you should not receive any live vaccines. Be sure to speak with your healthcare provider about appro-priate vaccinations before starting these medications. Biosimilars are similar, near identical copies of other already approved biologic therapies, known as the reference product or originator biologic. They are drugs that act just like a reference product, having the same effective-ness and safety in the patient population that it treats. Examples of this class of therapy include infliximab biosimiliars: infliximab-abda, adalimumab-adbm. Antibiotics may be used when infections\u2014such as an abscess (pocket of pus)\u2014occur. They treat Crohn's disease, peri-anal Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. They are also used to treat pouchitis, which is an inflammation of the ileal pouch (also known as a j-pouch, a surgically constructed internal pouch for those who have had their large intestine removed), and for prevention of recurrent Crohn's disease after surgery.10 11 to teach your child how to swallow pills at www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org. Corticosteroids: When a child has not responded to treatment with a 5-ASA, or if their disease is more severe at onset, oral corticosteroids may be prescribed. For severe cases, intravenous corticosteroids may be used\u2014necessitating a hospital stay. Once re-mission is achieved, corticosteroid dosage is tapered gradually. When patients are tapered off of corticosteroids, a strict schedule should be followed in order to minimize side effects that can occur if patients are weaned off too quickly. Long-term steroid use in children can also lead to growth problems and weak - ened bones (osteoporosis). To minimize the chance of osteoporosis, adequate calcium and vitamin D intake is essential. Immunomodulators: While immunomod-ulators can be prescribed for children with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis the approach to their use as a treatment can vary. Immunomodulators may often be prescribed as a combination therapy with biologics. All patients on immunomodulators need to be monitored closely for side effects, such as bone marrow problems as well as irritation of the liver or pancreas. Live vaccines are not recommended for IBD patients taking immunomodulators. Biologic therapies: Biologic therapies are commonly used in the treatment of pediat - ric IBD. Some of these therapies have been specifically approved by the FDA for use in children ages 6-17. Examples include Inflix - imab, approved for the treatment of children with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, and Adalimumab, approved for children with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. Other biologic therapies are being tested in children and are currently used in specific situations. Live vaccines are not recommended for IBD patients taking biologic medications.

Pediatric IBD Patients Customizing treatment for the individual with IBD is critical, including when that patient is a child or teenager. Most pediatric treatment choices were devel- oped after initial research on adults. As a result, drug dosages for a child must be carefully tai-lored to suit their age, size, and weight\u2014in ad-dition to existing symptoms, location of inflam-mation, and previous response to treatment. The same medications that are used to treat adults with IBD are also used for children. Still, there are some special considerations in treat - ment because children and teenagers are going through a period of physical and emotional growth and development. Here are some of the recommendations for the various medica-tion categories: Aminosalicylates: These compounds that contain 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) are gen-erally the first step in therapy for children with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis or mild Crohn's disease of the colon. Mesalamine, balsalazide, and olsalazine have fewer side effects than sulfasalazine. Drugs can be given either orally or rectally. The number of pills may be as many as 10 or more per day, which your doctor will advise how to handle with respect to your child's school schedule. Also, some children have trouble swallowing pills. In cases where swallowing capsules is a concern, your child's doctor may advise that specific capsules be opened and the contents mixed with food. You can download a pill-swallowing handout that will provide information on how 12 13 Even when there are no side effects, taking medication as prescribed by your doctor can seem like a nuisance, but it is an important step in helping manage your disease. Remember, taking medication to maintain remission can significantly reduce the risk of flares in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Tips to Help You Manage Your Medications Taking medication correctly means more than just taking the right amount at the right time. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist and learn as much as possible about the medica-tions you take and how they may affect you. For example, sometimes medications should be taken with food and other times on an empty stomach. Some medications require close monitoring for side effects. This may require blood work and follow-up visits as requested by your doctor. If possible, use the same pharmacy every time you get your prescription filled. Pharmacies can help you keep track of what you are taking. Don't take any medications that have expired. Don't take anyone else's medications or share yours with others. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about all medicines, supplements, or other things you may be taking for your health, including OTC medications, vitamins, and herbs. Use the medication log at the end of this brochure or an online tracker tool. Immunomodulators and biologics can in-crease the risk of upper respiratory and lung infections. Therefore it is recommended that you be up-to-date on certain vaccinations. Be aware that live virus vaccines might be contraindicated in these situations.important to talk to your health care provider about which vaccines are safe for your child to receive. Antibiotics: Metronidazole is used in children and teenagers with perianal Crohn's disease. It may also be used as an alternative treat - ment to 5-ASA or steroids for Crohn's colitis. Another antibiotic option is ciprofloxacin, which has been shown to be effective in adults with Crohn's colitis and inflammatory changes around the anus, including fistulas and abscesses in Crohn's disease. The use of ciprofloxacin and other drugs in the same class, called fluorquinolones, has been associated with an increased risk of tendon-itis and joint discomfort or pain. Their use in children has been controversial in the past, although studies have not demonstrated any increased risk of complications in children compared to adults. Making the Most of Your Treatment Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are long- term, chronic diseases. This means that people with these conditions may need to take medi-cation indefinitely. While not every person with IBD will be on medication all of the time, most people will require therapy most of the time to get well and stay well. For many individuals this may seem like a major concern, especially when some of those medi - cations produce unwanted side effects. Side ef - fects can vary and your doctor will explain which side effects are serious and require immediate attention, and which side effects are more mild and common. If you are experiencing unpleasant side effects or interactions with other drugs, don't stop taking your prescribed medication. Speak with your doctor and ask about possible adjustments that might reduce those effects.14 15 If you are having trouble affording your medi- cations, do not stop taking your medications. Alert your healthcare provider who may be able to help you find a solution. It is important that you take medications as prescribed, as some cannot be safely stopped abruptly. If the cost of treatment presents a problem for you, or if you have an insurance change, there may be a number of patient assistance programs that can help.

What to Ask Your Healthcare Provider About Your Medications It is only natural that you will have some concerns about the treatment that you will be receiving for IBD. What should you ask your doctor? What do you need to know about your treatment? The following are some of the questions you may want to ask: Why is this medication necessary? How long will I need to take this medication? How does this medication work? How long does it take for this medication to start working? Can I take vitamins, minerals, herbs, or other supplements while using the medication? Can I take OTC medications for joint pain, diarrhea, or abdominal pain? Can I get vaccines while I am on my IBD medication? What kind of side effects might I experience? Which are cause for alarm, and what should I do if these occur? What kind of interactions does this IBD medication have with other medications I may be taking for other conditions? What should I do if I miss a dose? What should I do if I have a negative reaction immediately after taking my medication? Is it safe to drink alcoholic beverages while on this medication? Remember to Tell the Doctor Before starting new medications, it is important for you to tell your doctor and other healthcare providers (including dentists or emergency room staff) about other medications you may be taking. Tell them whether you: Have taken this drug before (even if there was no unusual reaction). Have had an unusual or allergic reaction to this drug, or other medications. Have or have had any other medical conditions. Take any other medication or drugs (pre-scription or OTC), how long you have been taking them, your dose, and any side effects you may have. Take any vitamins, minerals, herbs, or other supplements. 16 17 Corticosteroids. Prednisone and other corticosteroids are low risk during pregnancy. Corticosteroids are not recommended for planned maintenance therapy in pregnant women, but talk to your doctor about use during flares in pregnancy. If a woman be-comes pregnant while on steroids, the doctor usually tries to minimize the dose. Nursing infants of women on moderate-to-high dos-ages of prednisone should be monitored by a pediatrician. Immunomodulators. Dosing of immunomod-ulators should be monitored during preg - nancy. Although many immunomodulators may appear as low risk, there is limited data in pregnancy. Both men and women should avoid methotrexate as it is known to cause birth defects. Biologics. Most biologics, such as cer - tolizumab (Cimzia\u00ae), are considered low risk. They also do not appear in breast milk. How - ever, both adalimumab and infliximab cross the placenta in high levels late in pregnancy, so your doctor may want to give the last dose in the middle of your third trimester. Pregnancy and Male Fertility With careful supervision of both a gastroenter - ologist and an obstetrician, most women with IBD can have a healthy pregnancy and a healthy baby. If you are considering becoming preg - nant, it is recommended to try to have your IBD in remission before you do so. Recent studies have shown that women do better during pregnancy if their disease is not active at the time of conception. Most experts agree that the major threat to pregnancy seems to come from the active disease itself, rather than the medication being used to treat the disease. Having active disease during preg - nancy can increase the risk of having a baby born prematurely or with a low birth weight. If you are pregnant and have IBD symptoms, your doctor will advise you as to which of the medications mentioned previously are safe to take. In most cases, medication schedules are maintained during pregnancy. However, there are some considerations and exceptions. It is also important to note that if a woman's condi-tion changes, drugs or dosages may be altered. Here are some of the recommendations for the various medica tion ca tegories: Aminosalicylates. appear to increase complications or harm the fetus. Sulfasal-azine may cause nausea and heartburn. As sulfasalazine lowers folic acid levels, women should be on at least 2 mg of folic acid daily. Women can breastfeed while taking a 5-ASA compound. 18 19 (the study of the body's immune defense sys- tem), microbiology (the study of microscopic organisms with the power to cause disease), and genetics (the study of how various tenden-cies and traits\u2014including diseases\u2014are passed from one generation to another). With new information being gathered all the time, there is good reason to be hopeful about future treatment for IBD. While we all wish for better treatments today, it's important to understand that it takes a long time for a promising development in the laboratory to become a drug ready for consumer use. In fact, the process of getting a drug to market, from first testing to final approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), may take as long as 10 years. Before a new drug or a new type of treatment is approved, it must go through a series of clinical trials. Clinical trials are well-organized studies that evaluate the treatment's efficacy and safety. Most clinical trials are classified into one of three phases: Phase I trials evaluate how a new drug should be given (by mouth, injected into the blood, or injected into the muscle), how often, and what doses are safe to use. Phase II trials test the safety of the new drug, as well as evaluate how well the drug works. Phase III trials test how well the new drug works and the best dose. Trial participants are divided into groups where one receives the medication and a \"control\" group receives a placebo (no chemical properties) or standard-of-care therapy. With the ever-increasing number of clinical trials of potential new IBD therapies, there is an even greater need for patient participation to see if these experimental therapies work. Antibiotics. Antibiotics are not recommend-ed for planned maintenance therapy in IBD during pregnancy. JAK Inhibitors. There is currently limited data in pregnancy. It is advised to consider other options, particularly in the first trimester. Because pregnancy is such a personal matter and there are so many factors that go into how a pregnancy may turn out, the choice of what medicines to take before and during pregnancy should be discussed with the healthcare provid-er treating your disease, as well as your obstetri - cian and your maternal fetal medicine specialist. While most of the recommendations regarding medication use and pregnancy focus on wom-en, there are some for men as well. For three months before conception, men should avoid taking methotrexate. Also, because the med-ication sulfasalazine decreases sperm count and therefore may cause infertility, a man tak - ing this drug should switch to another 5-ASA compound (with his doctor's approval). Discuss all medications with your doctor. For more information on Pregnancy and IBD, view our pregnancy fact sheet at www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/brochures. Participation in Clinical Trials Researchers working in laboratories all over the world are devoted to the scientific investi-gation of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in the hope of finding cures. That is good news when it comes to the devel- opment of new therapies for these diseases. New discoveries over the past decade have led to huge strides in the fields of immunology 20 21 Patients often find participation in a clinical trial a rewarding experience. Anyone can participate as long as they meet the criteria for that par - ticular trial. Those criteria may include type of symptoms, location or stage of disease, and age. Should you participate in a clinical trial of a new drug for Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis? To make that decision, you need to be fully informed about that trial and the drug that is being tested. All clinical trials have both benefits and risks associated with them. The advances in current IBD treatment are possible only because people before you participated in clinical trials. Find out more about clinical trials through the Foundation's Clinical Trials Com-munity at www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/clinical-trials-community . Improving Quality of Life The Crohn's & Colitis Foundation has estab-lished a range of educational materials and programs designed to increase awareness about Crohn's and ulcerative colitis. We know living with IBD can be difficult, but the right resources and support can make day-to-day living more comfortable. That's why the Foundation has developed a compre-hensive, free online community (www.crohn-scolitiscommunity.org) to provide the support individuals need in managing their condition. In-person support groups are also available in many locations nationwide. Find groups in your area at www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org, or call 1-888-694-8872. We recognize the importance of distributing unbiased, accurate, and authoritative informa-tion in order to provide education of the finest quality. One avenue used to accomplish this is the Irwin M. and Suzanne R. Rosenthal IBD Resource Center (IBD Help Center). Through a toll-free number (1-888-694-8872), e-mail, or live chat on our website (www.crohnscolitis-foundation.org), master's degree level health education professionals answer questions and direct people to resources that are important to help improve their quality of life. Tools and Resources You and your healthcare provider share one important goal: to get your IBD under control and keep it that way. One of the best ways to accomplish that is by carefully following the medication regimen your doctor has prescribed for you. To help you, we have provided a medication log toward the end of this brochure to track your treat - ment and care over time. We suggest you keep it somewhere handy so you can access it easily. The log also serves as a convenient reference for when you speak with your healthcare providers. Also included on the next page are medication profiles. The profiles include infor - mation about commonly used IBD medications. For a complete, up-to-date listing of all IBD medications visit www.ibdmedicationguide.org and for a listing of recently approved IBD medications visit www.crohnscolitisfounda-tion.org/brochures. These profiles do not contain all available infor - mation about the risks, benefits, and additional warnings for each medication listed. Please speak with your healthcare provider for more detailed information.

Physician Name: Physician Phone Number: Pharmacy Phone Number: About Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis belong to a group of conditions known as inflamma - tory bowel diseases , or IBD. These disorders affect the gastrointestinal (GI) tract , the area of the body where digestion takes place. As the name implies, these diseases cause inflam - mation of the intestine . When a part of the body is inflamed, it becomes swollen. Sores, or ulcers , may also form within the walls of the intestine. The ongoing inflammation leads to symptoms that may already be familiar to you: abdominal pain, cramping, diarrhea , rectal bleeding, and fatigue. For some people, their symptoms are not just restricted to the GI tract. They may experience signs of IBD in other parts of the body, such as the eyes, joints, skin, bones, kidneys, and liver. These are referred to as extraintestinal complications of IBD, because they occur outside of the intestine. Although Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis share a lot of symptoms, they do have some marked differences. While inflammation relat - ed to Crohn's disease may involve any part of the GI tract from the mouth to the anus (in- cluding the esophagus, stomach, small intes - tine , and large intestine ), ulcerative colitis is limited to just the large intestine (including the colon and rectum ). Another distinguishing fea - ture of ulcerative colitis is that it starts in the rectum and extends from there in a continuous area of inflammation. In contrast, Crohn's dis - ease may appear in \"patches,\" affecting some areas of the GI tract while leaving other sec - tions in between completely untouched. These are known as \"skip\" areas. These differences are important for deciding whether inflam - mation of the intestinal tract is from Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. In 10 percent of cases there are overlapping features Notes:Medication Log 1 44Name of medicationForm (i.e., pill) and/or method taken (i.e., oral)Start dateStop dateDosage/ strengthTimes taken dailySymptoms or side effectsPurpose (why do you take it?), comments, or special instructionsNotes: If you or someone you know has just been diagnosed with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, you may feel a bit overwhelmed by the news. In fact, you may not have even heard of these illnesses before. But now that you have, or even if you have been living with inflam - matory bowel diseases for quite a while, you will want to learn as much as possible about them\u2014including which medications can help control the diseases. That is the purpose of this brochure. "}
