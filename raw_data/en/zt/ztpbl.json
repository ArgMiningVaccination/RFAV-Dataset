If you're looking for a way to revamp your health beyond attempting Dry January and joining the local gym, these rituals from around the world provide a wellspring of inspiration. Mexico: Temazcal Steeped in Mescoamerican history and spirituality, the temazcal (Mexican sweat lodge) has been used for thousands of years to cleanse and heal. Although the details of the ritual may vary, ceremonies are led by a shaman or temazcalero who may incorporate herbs and prayers inside the steamy interior of an igloo-shaped stone structure, heated by hot rocks. Said to detoxify and heal the body while clarifying the mind, you'll emerge from the temazcal feeling brand new. Try it at Tulum's Y\u00e4an Healing Sanctuary, where proceeds from moon temazcal ceremonies support indigenous youth through the Movida Maya Non Profit Organization.

Shinrin-yoku, or \"forest bathing,\" is essentially mindfulness and its benefits are similar to meditation. By applying sustained attention to the present moment - the scent of foliage, the gently swaying boughs, and the sound of distant bird calls - you can reduce your stress levels, lower your blood pressure, enhance your immunity, and boost creativity. The best part? It's free and easily accessible; all you need is a wooded area and your senses (though forest bathing in Japan would be the dream, or course).

Housed in intricately designed buildings with domed roofs and marble floors, hammams offer more than a place to bathe - they are also a social hub where people gather to build community in a relaxed setting. Getting a good scrub down with good company fulfills two primary well-being needs - self-care and strong social bonds - making it a worthy investment in your health regardless of whether it's a one-off or once-a-month activity.
