Symptoms like a sore, scratchy throat, hoarse voice, and heartburn might be signs of esophageal damage. Your esophageal sphincter is a muscular ring that prevents stomach acid and food from flowing out of your stomach and into your esophagus. If it doesn't close all the way, you'll experience acid reflux and heartburn, which damages your esophagus. You might be able to heal your esophagus by changing your diet, making lifestyle changes, and using home treatments. However, check with your doctor before using natural treatments. Additionally, see your doctor to confirm the cause of your esophageal damage so you know you're getting the right treatment. Steps Changing Your Diet [Download Article](#) - 1Eat 6 small meals a day so your stomach doesn't get too full. If your stomach is too full, the food might flow out of your stomach and into your esophagus. This can further damage your esophagus. To help your esophagus heal, shrink the size of your meals. Rather than eating 3 big meals, eat 6 snack-size meals about every 2-3 hours. [[1]](#_note-1)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public [Go to source](#) - Smaller meals are less likely to cause acid reflux. This gives your esophagus time to heal. - 2Eliminate your trigger foods from your diet. Keep a food diary to figure out which foods trigger your acid reflux. Then, cut these foods from your diet. This might reduce your acid reflux so your esophagus can heal. Common triggers include the following: [[2]](#_note-2)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public [Go to source](#) Advertisement - Caffeine - Spicy foods - Fatty foods - Mint-flavored foods - Chocolate - Tomatoes - Citrus - Onions - Garlic - Coffee - Tea - Soda - 3Eat a high fiber diet so stomach empties faster. Fiber improves your digestive process, so a high fiber diet may help you manage your stomach acid production. Make sure you eat enough fiber to meet your daily dietary recommendations. [[3]](#_note-3)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health [Go to source](#)Consume at least 25 g of fiber daily if you're a woman or 38 g of fiber daily if you're a man. [[4]](#_note-4)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals [Go to source](#) - High fiber foods include vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, beans, legumes, and whole grains. For example, you could include a daily serving of sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, chia seeds, flax seed, or almonds to boost your fiber intake. Tip: If you don't consume a lot of high fiber foods, an over-the-counter fiber supplement may help you reach your fiber goals. Talk to your doctor to find out if a fiber supplement is right for you. - 4Consume more probiotics to help your stomach digest food faster. Probiotics support healthy gut bacteria, which supports a healthy digestive system. To increase your probiotics, eat yogurt with live active cultures and fermented foods, such as kimchi, sauerkraut, miso, tempeh, and kombucha. This might reduce your incidence of acid reflux. [[5]](#_note-5)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health [Go to source](#) - You can also find over-the-counter probiotic supplements. Check with your doctor to find out if they're right for you. - 5 [Stop drinking alcohol](/Quit-Drinking-Alcohol)because it may cause acid reflux. Alcohol relaxes your esophageal sphincter, which is a muscular ring that closes your esophagus. Normally, your esophageal sphincter prevents your stomach contents from rising up into your esophagus. Since alcohol relaxes your sphincter, it may trigger acid reflux. Eliminate alcohol from your diet to allow your esophagus to heal. [[6]](#_note-6)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health [Go to source](#) - If you don't want to stop drinking, you might limit yourself to 1 drink a day. Additionally, don't drink within 2 hours before bed because your stomach acid may flow up while you're sleeping. Making Lifestyle Changes [Download Article](#) - 1Maintain a healthy weight to reduce your risk for acid reflux. When you're carrying excess body weight, it may apply pressure to your esophageal sphincter. This may open your esophageal sphincter, allowing your stomach acid to escape and damage your esophagus. Talk to your doctor to find out your optimal target weight. Then, change your diet and increase your activity to help you reach and maintain your healthy weight. [[7]](#_note-7)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals [Go to source](#) - Don't assume you need to lose weight without talking to your doctor. Similarly, don't make diet or exercise changes without checking with your doctor to make sure they're safe for you. - 2Take pills with a full glass of water so they don't lodge in your throat. Pills may get stuck in your throat, which can irritate your esophagus. To prevent this, drink a full glass of water every time you take a pill to wash it down. This might protect your esophagus. [[8]](#_note-8)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals [Go to source](#) - If you're taking more than 1 pill, swallow them 1 at a time to make it easier for them to go down. However, you don't need to drink more than 1 full glass of water. - 3Stop eating 3 hours before you go to bed. After you eat, it takes a few hours for your body to digest your food. If you lie down during this time, your stomach contents and stomach acid may flow up into your esophagus. Avoid eating late night meals and snacks so you don't go to bed on a full stomach. [[9]](#_note-9)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals [Go to source](#) - It also helps to prop yourself up on pillows or elevate the head of your bed so that your food and stomach acid flow downwards. This may prevent it from damaging your esophagus. - 4Wait 2-3 hours after a meal to engage in vigorous exercise. While it's okay to take a walk after you eat, intense exercise may push stomach acid up into your esophagus. To prevent further esophageal damage, allow your food to digest for at least 2-3 hours before you work out. This may help you avoid acid reflux so your esophagus can heal. [[10]](#_note-10)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public [Go to source](#) - For instance, you might exercise 2 hours after your afternoon meal, just before dinner. Similarly, you might work out in the morning before you eat breakfast. - 5Chew gum to increase saliva production, which neutralizes acid. When you chew gum, your mouth naturally produces more saliva. Because saliva neutralizes stomach acid, chewing gum may help your esophagus heal. Chew a piece of gum after a meal or when you're experiencing heartburn. [[11]](#_note-11)X Research source - Since minty flavors might trigger acid production, pick flavors other than mint. - 6 [Quit smoking](/Quit-Smoking)to avoid drying out your esophagus. You probably already know that smoking harms your health, but cigarette smoke dries out your esophagus and damages your blood vessels. Smoking also relaxes your esophageal sphincter, which allows your stomach acid to flow up into your esophagus. Quitting is extremely difficult, so talk to your doctor about quitting aids to help you cut out cigarettes for good. [[12]](#_note-12)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health [Go to source](#) - Your doctor may prescribe you patches, lozenges, gum, acupuncture, and prescription medication to help you quit. Using Home Treatments [Download Article](#) - 1Take an herbal acid reflux remedy if your doctor says it's okay. Herbal treatments for acid reflux include licorice, chamomile, slippery elm, and marshmallow. Purchase capsules or tablets from your local drug store, a health food store, or online. After checking with your doctor, use your herbal treatment as directed on the label. [[13]](#_note-13)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals [Go to source](#) - Don't take an herbal remedy without talking to your doctor, as they can interfere with certain medications. Additionally, ask your doctor to recommend the proper dosage for you. - Be aware that licorice can raise blood pressure if taken in high doses over the long-term. If you do decide to try licorice, opt for a supplement labeled as deglycyrrhizinated, also known as DGL, such as rhizinate chewable DGL. - 2Use relaxation techniques to help prevent acid reflux. Unfortunately, stress may trigger acid reflux, so it's important to [manage your stress](/Relieve-Stress)levels. To help you keep stress in check, incorporate stress relievers into your daily.

While there's little evidence that it works, you might get heartburn relief from acupuncture.

Talk to an acupuncturist to find out if the treatment might help you.

Read the label and take your antacids as directed. Use them as needed to relieve your heartburn. [[16]](#_note-16)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals [Go to source](#) - Check with your doctor before using antacids.
