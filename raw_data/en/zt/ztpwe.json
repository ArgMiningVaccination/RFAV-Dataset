Her poems and prose musings have appeared in Pr airie Schooner, Crab Creek Review, Fiction Writers Review, and other journals, and she blogs regularly for Michigan Quarterly Review. Claire works as an editor and lives in Ann Arbor with her husband. I recently sat down with this talented young writer in the CW Tea Room. After our brief chat, I followed up with Claire, emailing her with more specific questions about her poetry, inspiration, and writing process. She also selected two of her poems to share with Crazy Wisdom readers.GETTING TO KNOW POET Q. Claire, how long have you been writing poetry? A. Since about the age of 17, off and on. I had always been a dedicated reader of everything (poems, novels, my mother's New Yorkers , leftover newspapers), and I liked writing essays for English class and stories in my free time, and, after reading Anne Frank, I kept a diary, but I didn't think much beyond that. Anyway, the summer before my last year of high school, bored and sitting around the house, a poem popped into my head. I wrote it down in its entirety and never revised it. It was a short lyric poem that ended on an image of a woman diving into a quarry pool. I knew then that I wanted to keep writing poems, mostly because it felt so good to do so. I would later learn, of course, that poems rarely arrive fully formed and that they almost always require considerable revision over time. Q. When did you know you were going to be a writer? A. It was never a conscious decision. Doors kept opening. A poem would be accepted into a journal, or I would befriend a poet who would give me an earful if I wasn't writing, or I got into grad school for poetry. Beyond the simply fortuitous, I continue to write because the process of writing fundamentally remains one of pleasure (once I can push past my tendencies for procrastination and anxiety, that is). Q. Prior to living in Ann Arbor, you lived in Arizona, is that right? Does living here inspire or inform your writing in a different way than Arizona? If so, in what ways has Ann Arbor in particular found its way into your poems?A. In Arizona, my writing was inspired by the desert and its ecology. Mountains, birds, and wildlands figured in prominently. In Ann Arbor, I have retreated from writing so explicitly about my surroundings. That said, the landscape of Michigan nevertheless crops up in unexpected ways. Snow drifts, ice, and big, cold lakes have appeared as imagery in my poetry, and I've even written a poem about the local thrift store Value World. Living in Ann Arbor has also solidified my identity as a writer. It's hard not to write here, what with all the bookstores, readings, and the sheer number of writers that I bump into in seemingly every coffee shop I go and ask me how my writing's going. Q. When we met in the Tea Room, one of the things you mentioned is that you enjoy rhyming and that you do it quite often. What role or roles does rhyme play in your poems?A. Its role is fundamentally one of pleasure. There is delight in encountering a rhyme, especially in a place that wasn't expected. Rhyming also forges connections between disparate elements. You didn't think that two words had any connection? A rhyme asks you to think again. Rhyming announces the song-like quality of a poem. I've always believed that poetry is more akin to music than it is to fiction or any other form of writing. Rhyming signals this. Q. You also talked about how your poetry is \"rooted in personal experience.\" I had referenced a quote of yours that I liked, from commentary you had written about your poem \"Jaguar\" (published on newborder.org): \"Sometimes what you don't know is just as interesting as what you do.\" Can you talk a little more about this? A. Those of us who have taken our fair share of writing workshops have heard the oft-repeated piece of wisdom. \"Write what you know.\" This is stellar advice, but it is also, like any piece of advice, limiting. When I lived in Tucson, I wanted to write about the U.S.-Mexico border, in particular the effects of the Border Wall on wildlife such as jaguars and mountain lions. But I often talked myself out of it. What did I know? I worked as a waitress and had a degree in poetry. Those were my specialties. How could I add to the conversation about borderlands ecology in a meaningful or effective way? Then, it occurred to me that writing from a place of respectful curiosity was an all right place to begin. As women, we're taught by this culture to be polite, gracious, and demurring. (I'm originally from the South, so this has been especially true for me.) Therefore, I remain suspicious of any advice, however well-meaning or helpful, that discourages me from tackling a subject matter that I'm interested in, but may not know much about \u2014 yet. Q. Along those same lines, have you ever caught yourself writing from an \"inauthentic\" place? Or, in other words, found yourself starting a poem or essay in a voice that doesn't feel quite like your own? A. Often I don't know I've written from an inauthentic place until months or years later when I look back at a poem and realize I was unconsciously imitating the style of someone else. Then I have a choice: to abandon the poem or revise it. I also rely on fellow poets to call me out when I've strayed off course. Acquiring readers who support my work and are unafraid to offer honest feedback has been crucial for me. Q. Can you tell us a little about your poems \"What's New\" and \"What's Left\"? A. These poems revolve around the death of my aunt in the 9/11 attacks. I was 14 and our family was close-knit, so her death altered my world absolutely. How do you write about trauma \u2014 personal, familial, national? How do you talk about 9/11? It seemed to me that a place to begin was with fragmented images that eventually cohere into some kind of emotional intensity. \"What's Left\" is a poem of detritus and aftermath. In terms of structure, it's a list poem, a list of things that are left over. With hindsight, I can now see that I was trying to capture the psychological experience of shock. \"What's New\" is also a list poem of, literally, things that are new. It was inspired by a dream I had of my aunt that felt just as real as anything else that's ever happened to me. I would later learn, of course, that poems rarely arrive fully formed and that they almost always require considerable revision over time. Living in Ann Arbor has also solidified my identity as a writer. It's hard not to write here, what with all the bookstores, readings, and the sheer number of writers that I bump into in seemingly every coffee shop I go . . . CLAIRE SKINNERGETTING TO KNOW POET The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 7 WHAT'S NEW A small white tooth growing from a six-year old girl' s gum. Green grass under dry yellow straw . A blackberry thorn in a brown bear's paw. In 1953, whatever Jackson Pollack was up to. Snowdrops, snowdrops. Consider the crocus. Purple blood on a bed sheet. The cactus blossom spilling pollen. The lamb and his perfect heart. The Beautiful Son pushing the boulder away from the dark. What they don't mention: He smiled. He was smiling. That the light in his eyes was bright but wasn't blinding.A week after you died, I dreamed you came back. I left to find the Ultimate Little Black Dress, you said. Did you find it? we asked. *Previously published in Crab Creek Review, Summer 2013WHAT'S LEFT Receipts, pennies, rubber bands. Last night's salad. Bean sprouts. A half-opened can. Icing on paper plates. Banana peel and a kiwi's skin. Wildflowers in the median. A pi\u00f1ata, beaten and torn open\u2014 silver crinkles, orange plastic. Peanut butter on dull knives. Rubble. Steel. Smoke. Pink and wilting roses. MISSING posters. Tacks and staples. It was something like this: blue day, gold dawn. Once Anna was here. Then one day she was gone. Q. Who are some of your major influences? A. I am a devoted apprentice to the poetry and miscellaneous writings of Emily Dickinson, John Keats, Anne Sexton, Lisa Russ Spaar, Laura Kasischke, Diane Seuss, Anne Carson, Carrie Fountain, Mary Jo Bang, Ezra Pound, Roland Barthes, Gregory Orr, Elizabeth Bishop, Suzanne Buffam, Francesco Petrarch, Charles Wright, Maggie Nelson, Kathleen Graber, Benjamin Alire S\u00e1enz, Lucille Clifton, and Debra Nystrom. I am also not so secretly a devotee of Old English poetry for its unabashed, over-the-top musicality as well as its lack of self-consciousness. Q. When you feel a lull in your writing, what are some ways you break through the writer's block?A. It's not easy. But a tried-and-true trick is to take myself to a poetry reading. Hearing poems aloud can be helpful, but, more than that, the very act of showing up for a poetry reading is a way of announcing to myself and to the world at large that poetry is possible and that I'm committed to it. I left the house, put on lipstick, and attended a reading. That's forward motion. That's a step closer to a poem. During lulls, I also read the writers I love to remind myself why I write poetry (and so that their good juju can rub off on me). Another good trick is make a gin and tonic with the juice of an entire lime, open a blank Word document, and play mood music \u2014 something with no lyrics, or lyrics in another language. Then I'll close my eyes and begin to write. I've noticed that if I'm not looking at what I'm typing, the critical part of my brain shuts off. Q. What are you reading right now? A. I recently finished The Interestings , a large and capacious novel by Meg Wolitzer, and I'm halfway through the dazzling novel Unbecoming , by Ann Arborite Rebecca Scherm. I'm a big fan of the novel, in part because it's so dissimilar from the compressed, intense poetry that I like to write and read. My friend Gala Mukomolova, a fellow Ann Arbor poet, has just introduced me to Erin Belieu and Ada Lim\u00f3n, two poets I can't get enough of. And I'm always reading Laura Kasischke, Diane Seuss, and Jo Ann Beard. I keep their books close (on the nightstand, in my purse) in case I need inspiration or some company. Q. What is one book you might recommend to someone who doesn't typically read poetry \u2014 a book to serve as an \"icebreaker\" of sorts? Rhyming also forges connections between disparate elements. You didn't think that two words had any connection? A rhyme asks you to think again.A. A good place to start, I think, is with Marie Howe's book What the Living Do, which chronicles her fraught childhood, experience taking care of her terminally-ill brother, and the pleasures and difficulties of romantic love. The poems are narratives, little stories, and they rely on plain-spoken language and concrete imagery. Q. Could you share with us a few lines or a favorite stanza of yours that has stayed with you over the years? Something you may have memorized, or jotted down, or that has continually inspired you in some way? A. This isn't poetry, but it's by the godfather of poetry, John Keats, so I hope it counts. In an 1817 letter to his brothers George and Tom, Keats writes: \"It struck me, what quality went to form a Man of Achievement especially in Literature & which Shakespeare possessed so enormously \u2014 I mean Negative Capability , that is when man is capable of being in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact & reason.\" For me, what Keats is saying here, what he means by the rather abstract term \"Negative Capability,\" is that the greatest literature arises from a writer's ability to accept (or at least tolerate) ambiguity, that uncomfortable feeling of not knowing. From that space, he suggests, poetry can occur. Thank you, Claire! For me, what Keats is saying here, what he means by the rather abstract term \"Negative Capability,\" is that the greatest literature arises from a writer's ability to accept (or at least tolerate) ambiguity, that uncomfortable feeling of not knowing. From that space, he suggests, poetry can occur. ### The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 8 Alone, Suddenly And Then For Too Long by Gala Mukomolova My mother ate glass this morning. Mix ed in with eggplant caviar, she thought it was migrant pieces of shell or whole spice. On the phone with me, she recounts the texture of it between her teeth, grainy at first, passable, and then smooth, without give. I try not to get too nervous. After all, there are circus and sideshow performers who eat glass nightly, I have met some of them, seen them speak through their unmarred mouths. I imagine my 68-year-old mother wearing a black unitard, rhinestoned (which she actually owned between the ages of 48 and 56), crunching down on a bowl of glass as if it were corn flakes. My mother interrupts my fantasy. \"I had to throw it out, right?\" she asks, \"I mean, why take the risk?\" And, before I can reassure her, she's on to her next topic. Galachka, she speaks to me only in Russian, are you sending out your poems? Maybe there's a talent contest you can enter. A TV show you can make an appearance on? My mother's idea of American Life For Americans is deeply influenced by telenovelas and episodes of Ukraine's Got Talent. She spends a lot of time alone now that my father is gone, rarely leaves our Russian neighborhood. I can't seem to find the words, or courage, to tell her that my poems are not the kind that get performed on episodes of Ellen (who she likes, despite her \"Lesbian sickness\"). I know something about being alone suddenly and then for too long. The body forgets how it's done, waking up to silence and knowing that you need your own voice to break it.It took me a long time to learn how to protect my mother, that there are small betrayals I must forgive her for. I read her my poems sparingly, if at all. It's almost impossible to find something I've written that wouldn't appall her, shame her with details of my sexual life. Once, I spent an entire evening diligently translating a poem about one of my childhood memories. It was, not subtly, an attempt to bring her closer to me. After listening to me read the translation out loud, my mother sighed, \"Yes, it all happened just like this,\" and left the room. For some daughters, a mother's choice to settle deeply into herself must feel like a blessing. The mother obtains a small dog, a knack for painting watercolors. Maybe there's a small cottage in the Catskills the mother absconds to, where she might gather oversized zucchini from her humble, if not generous, garden. For other daughters, for the ones like me, it is something akin to watching an old wall erode. The rust gets brighter. The decorative work chips off and reveals something raw and unchanging underneath. What I mean is, it has taken me a long time to realize my mother will never love the part of me who loves women, will never know me as a woman who is in love, a woman who is happy. For her part, my mother has held onto the illusion of marriage as a form of salvation for a surprisingly long time, despite the fact that she was the primary source of income for our family and in many ways my father's caregiver. Few women spend 28 years of marriage preparing to be alone, and my mother is no exception. Four years after his death, she maintains that she is at a loss without him, less liked, less protected, less. I know something about being alone suddenly and then for too long. The body forgets how it's done, waking up to silence and knowing that you need your own voice to break it. I want to tell you about the love I have lost but in writing about my mother I can feel myself obscure my own heartbreak, for her sake and maybe for yours too, reader. There are only so many things we can learn about each other at one given time. Instead, I will tell you about my mother, the woman I imagine she must be on her own. In a small apartment in Brooklyn, my mother gets up from the same couch she's had for twenty years, which looks only five years old because she beats it with a wet rag every Sunday. It is the couch she sleeps on because her bed is too empty. She prepares breakfast, eggplant caviar made the night before, toast, and a little rosehip tea. When she recognizes the glass in her mouth, she stops chewing and looks down into the cracked bowl. After a minute of reckoning she lifts the bowl and carries it over to a small trashcan. Standing in the kitchen she says aloud to no one \"I should wash the dishes\" and then washes them: cup, plate, knife, fork. Gala Mukomolova received her MFA from the Helen Zell Writers' Program; her work has been published in the Indiana Review, Drunken Boat, PANK, and elsewhere. Monthly, she transforms into an astrologer called Galactic Rabbit.For other daughters, for the ones like me, it is something akin to watching an old wall erode. The rust gets brighter.

Each was stocked decades ago with largemouth bass and bluegill, and since then, the fish populations have flourished. I've seen them from the water's edge, sleek shapes among the weeds, under overhanging branches, and near the pilings of the old dock. On a recent visit, my kids asked if we could go fishing, so we went to the nearest of the ponds with the two decrepit fishing rods from the wrap-around porch, rigged with the only two lures available. One rod sometimes loses its upper half with a hard cast. The other has a broken reel mount, so the reel is always on the brink of falling off. I demonstrated how to cast and reel in the line, and the kids practiced casting toward the center of the pond. At first, they were too quick and jerky in their movements, naturally thinking that casting far requires a lot of force, and the lures flew astray or splashed hard into the water just a few feet away. \"Try slowing down and moving more smoothly,\" I told them, \"and let the rod do the rest.\" After some more fits and starts, they sent their lures soaring gracefully farther and farther toward the middle of the pond as their fishing rods became extensions of their arms. Their smiles flashed as they hit their marks more often than not. I showed them how to work the lures back to shore, varying speeds and angles and bringing them close past likely fish hideouts. As I watched the children, memories of my grandfather rushed into my mind. Papa was an angler, not by profession, but by passion. A Chicago native, he fished the lakes of the Midwest for years, returning to his favorites, like Lake of the Woods in Minnesota, time and again. Later, when he and Nana moved to my hometown of Los Angeles, he didn't get to fish as often. Yet he talked about fishing with a wistfulness that I didn't hear from him on any other subject, though baseball sometimes came close for the former second baseman. When he talked fishing, his clear blue eyes shone and a grin lit his round face. His tackle box was among my favorite things, a massive green case that opened by splitting apart the top to reveal six stacked trays, three on a side, which lifted into perfect tiers to reveal a meticulously organized array of lures. When I was about ten years old, Papa bought me my first fishing gear, a grey, six- foot, light-action Browning rod and matching Mitchell reel. That same evening, I took the rubber band off the spool of the reel \u2014 exactly what he had told me not to do. I did it so I could see the line, thin and bluish-white, almost luminous in the light of my bedroom. The line instantly sprang from the spool with a will and quickly grew into a bird's nest, even as I tried to hold it in place. I shuffled down the hall and into the dining room, where Papa was sitting at the table, and handed him the mess. He took a slow, appraising look and said, \"Took off the rubber band, huh?\" Then he set to work on it. His hands were knobby and his fingers blunt, perhaps from the physical labor he did as a grocery warehouseman, yet he deftly handled the ultra-fine line. He could have cut it, of course. Or he could have made me deal with it to teach me a lesson. But he knew that the lesson had been learned already. Nothing more needed to be said. Fishing with my children, I remembered standing as a boy with Papa in my front yard, casting a rubber weight over and over again as he gently gave me nuggets of advice. I remembered my practice casts hitting the near edge of the neighbor's lawn, then the middle, and eventually the driveway, beyond the lawn, and Papa giving me encouragement: \"Oooh! That was a good one! Try putting the next one over there.\" Before long, Papa took me to Lake Casitas for my first real fishing trip. There, he showed my cousin and me how to place our casts precisely under overhangs, where bass might be lurking, though only my uncle caught anything on that broiling day. Later, my cousin and I attended a day camp that ended the summer with a week-long fishing adventure in the Sierras. Before that trip, Papa showed us how to rig for rainbow and brown trout. Fishing the San Joaquin and Owens Rivers, Twin Lakes, Horseshoe Lake, and Lake Mary, I did as he taught, keeping quiet by the bank, standing so that my shadow did not darken the water, and placing my bait or lures right where I wanted them. He was a great teacher; I caught plenty of fish. Despite my childhood love of fishing, and the fact that Papa frequently extolled the angling wonders of Michigan when I moved here 20 years ago, as an adult I've fished very little. Yet in Georgia, as I taught my children, Papa's lessons came back to me as if riding into my mind on my memories of him. When my kids felt comfortable casting and working the lures back to shore, we talked about where the fish might be, and I taught them as Papa had taught me. There were some good looking overhangs and weedy areas, and while we risked losing our lures to snags, the kids felt confident that they could place them right where they wanted them, just as my cousin and I had at Lake Casitas and in the Sierras so many years before. That's what they did, and it worked. Each of them caught and released a lot of fish. They caught the fishing bug, too, as I had once. During our few days in Georgia, the children and I grabbed whatever time we could to go down to the pond and see if the fish were biting. The children's eyes shone, and their faces wore joyous grins, as Papa's had when he fished or just talked about it. I watched quietly as the children angled, admiring their patience and concentration. Their casts were beautiful \u2014 their arms cocked back and then brought their fishing rods forward swiftly and smoothly, and their lures flew into the pond trailed by an arc of line that settled gently onto the water. I watched their intent looks as they worked the lures back to shore, bringing them right past where they thought the fish might be waiting. And I thought about how much Papa would have loved that moment. The surge of closeness to him that I felt watching his great-grandchildren fish that pond in northern Georgia brought to the surface not only how much I miss him but also the tremendous gifts he gave me over the years: his love, encouragement, and knowledge. They are gifts I try to pass along to my children, and like most parents, I don't always succeed. But when I do, my mind fills with warm thoughts of those who bestowed those gifts upon me, and Papa was one of my primary sources.

And Other Religious Observations from the Children of Secular America My five-year-old daughter, Lila, and I were cuddled up at bedtime talking about God, a conversation that, as a non-believer, I can only sustain by relying on the belief systems of others. We were running down the list of people we knew who were religious: our Hindi neighbor, a Buddhist colleague, our Jewish friends, our mixed-bag family of Christians, Pagans, and atheists, and finally Grandma Bird. \"And what does Grandma Bird believe?\" \"She believes that God had a son named Jesus that helped people on earth a long time ago.\"\"Jesus?! Like the swear word Jesus Christ?\"\"Yes, only Grandma doesn't like it when people use the name in a mean way.\"\"Oh, for Christ's sake !'\" \"Exactly.\"\"I believe in Jesus Christ, too.\"\"Really?\"\"Yeah. So God has a kid. Even if he named him a swear.\"\"I like having a kid.\"\"Yeah you do. Tell it to me again!\" Lila is being raised by heathens and she's not alone. In his recent LA Times op ed, \"How Secular Family Values Stack Up,\" sociologist Phil Zuckerman found that 23 percent of American adults have no religion, creating a new demographic segment called the \"Nones,\" short for \"nothing in particular.\" And while this is certainly unprecedented from a historical standpoint, it seems that lessons of morality and The Golden Rule are flourishing regardless of whether a household incorporates worship into family life. While I don't have any doubt that this is true, I couldn't help but wonder, reading Zuckerman's piece, if the human craving for a spiritual life has really dissipated or if the generation raising children is just jaded. If the former, then Lila isn't the only kid whose frequent questions about God and curiosities about religion are being fielded by \"Nones\" like myself. \"Historically, American religion has followed an ethnic thread,\" said Ian Burch, a priest at St. Chrysostom's Episcopal Church in Chicago. He continued: Danish immigrants would make Aebleskiver (Danish doughnuts) to share at Sunday service. Catholics had Fish Fry Fridays. In large part, your religion is hooked into your family's immigration story; in many ways, church was an expression of culture. We might be seeing weaker ties to religion in America because we have weaker ties to our heritage. Overall, I see an ambivalence in young families that is probably unprecedented. When I was Lila's age, my atheist mom and I lived with my atheist English grandparents and my atheist English great-grandmother. Once, while serving the Queen in the Corps of Royal Engineers in Egypt, my grandpa flirted with joining a numerology cult but was put off by the floral head-garlands the members were required to wear. There is also a story that emerged after some genealogical digging on my grandfather's part, stating that one of my great-great-aunts was the last alleged witch to be burned at the stake in England. That's about as close as my maternal family comes to organized religion. As a child I was told that when you die, your body returns to the earth to make beautiful flowers and forests. On vacation hikes with my grandpa, he'd sit me on his lap at rest times, taking stock of the mountains around us and say, \"We're just a little tiny speck, aren't we?\" On autumn walks with my grandma, we'd open milkweed pods in the wind and watch the white fluff swirl; it was all the magic I needed and as close to spiritual as I've ever felt. In stark contrast, I spent every other weekend with my biological dad who shipped me off to my great-grandparent's Southern Baptist Church for Vacation Bible School. There, a youth leader crushed my little paleontologist dreams by telling me that dinosaurs weren't real and that fossils were just a bunch of chicken bones glued together by scientists trying to get rich. My love for the Apatosaurus and my maternal grandparents was strong: aside from a brief alterna-teen flirtation with Paganism, I became a steadfast atheist pretty early on. As for my husband, Shaun, he was raised by my second-generation Greek mother-in-law. While she speaks fondly of a childhood with ruby red Orthodox Easter eggs, we think she started attending a Lutheran church in college. While Shaun loves the human capacity for belief and incorporates ancient belief-based stories in his life as a fiction writer, as far as personal beliefs go, he's pretty much a \"None\" too. When Phil Zuckerman's LA Times editorial went viral, I was honestly happy to see a secular voice so accurately and positively represented. That said, raising a purely secular child seemed unfair to me; while Shaun and I had knowledge and experience to base our \"non-belief\" around, Lila was left high and dry. Plus, Lila was asking frequent questions about faith, God, and religion. As parents, Shaun and I agreed to love and support Lila in her religious decisions but we weren't really giving her any guidance, nothing to take comfort in or rebel against. If she expressed interest in ukulele, swimming, or gymnastics, we'd make room in the budget and sign her up for lessons straight away. But faith? It was generally a vague bedtime chat equivalent of \"that's nice, dear.\" A chat that has cropped up on average two times a week for the past year. \"Ultimately, if you don't explore questions of faith with her, someone else will,\" said Rabbi Bob Levy of Ann Arbor's Temple Beth Emeth. \"It could be a neighbor, a friend, or a complete stranger. It's better for everyone if this is dealt with in the loving warmth of your family.\" I asked a friend of mine, doula S olana Windsor-Silvia, what she thought of this statement. Restless with her Catholic upbringing, Solana had always been a \"seeker.\" A fellow alterna-teen Pagan, Solana never felt she could talk to her parents about questions of faith; in a household where children were to be seen and not heard, it was unequivocally off limits. Solana fled to a house for college-aged inter-denominational Christians in Colorado after high school. She ended up fleeing the housing situation with her now-husband in the middle of the night after a roommate \u2014 a woman who routinely performed exorcisms on the toaster \u2014 burned Solana's Beatles records and blamed Solana's \"vicious spirit\" for causing health issues in the house. \"I was a misfit,\" Solana said, \"and an extremist will prey on misfits, people who don't know where they're going.\" Solana eventually converted to Judaism after working for the Jewish Federation of Metro Detroit. While her first boss was an Orthodox male with whom she had little in common, she was in a position where she had to learn how to communicate, dress, and not offend people of a different culture. Her next supervisor in the organization was a female of the Reform persuasion; her feminist ideals (expressed in the celebration of Purim, honoring the Book of Esther), combined with earth-based celebrations (Tu B'Shevat \u2014 the Festival of the Trees), and a monolithic God all added up to a compelling fit for Solana. \"The religion offered me what I was looking for, both in concrete celebratory terms and in flexibility,\" Solana said. She continued: My rabbis were very receptive and human when I would talk to them about archetypical concepts of religion, like heaven. They basically said, \"It's up to every individual to determine what they believe.\" My conversion was a ten-year process. I needed time to by Truly Render Lila is being raised by heathens and she's not alone. ...sociologist Phil Zuckerman found that 23 percent of American adults have no religion, creating a new demographic segment called the \"Nones,\" short for \"nothing in particular.\"As parents, Shaun and I agreed to love and support Lila in her religious decisions but we weren't really giving her any guidance, nothing to take comfort in or rebel against. \"For me, it really was about connecting with the community. I never suspected that any of us felt any direct connection to religion.\" - Garrett SchumannThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 11 come to terms with my newfound beliefs, find comfortability in celebrating the holidays, and it is a different culture you adopt \u2014 it is not just a religion. Plus, I'm a mother. Judaism is matriarchal, so it meant my daughter, Genevieve, would be a Jew because I'm a Jew. It was a lot to take on. My friend, composer Garrett Schumann, experienced a conversion from the other side of things, as a family member. In his formative years, Garrett grew up in Texas attending a mega-church every Sunday with his older brother, Jonathan, his twin, Matthew, and his parents. Garrett's family moved to Connecticut when he was a pre-teen and found themselves in the intimate setting of a 300-year-old Congregational church with Puritan roots. While church was a weekly part of family life, Garrett reports that discussions of faith never happened at home. \"We never had discussions at home about faith, belief, or feelings,\" said Garrett. \"We went to church and it was perfunctory \u2014 in a good way, but routine nonetheless. For me, it really was about connecting with the community. I never suspected that any of us felt any direct connection to religion.\" After an adolescence spent serving as church Youth Leaders, underscored by Garrett playing Mozart trumpet requiems at Sunday service, Garrett and his twin, Matthew, attended Rice University in Texas, where Garrett studied music while his brother pursued a major in religious studies with an emphasis on Islam. \"After 9/11, Matthew was really curious about Islam and about the role the religion played in modern society. While this intellectual pursuit made total sense, there was nothing that really foreshadowed the changes to come.\" In the spring of their junior year in college, Matthew sent a 2 a.m. text from two dorm rooms down the hall from his twin: \"DUDE. I JUST CONVERTED TO ISLAM.\" \"The real shock when my twin converted to Islam wasn't that he converted to Islam, but that he was religious. It had nothing to do with the exotic nature of Islam; it was that he had been grappling with issues of faith or was even religious in the first place.\" Like Solana, for whatever reason Matthew was unable to explore his questions of faith at home. And while I wouldn't be bothered in the slightest by Lila adopting Islam or Judaism, I'd hate for her to do so in isolation. Rabbi Levy's words echo strong: if you don't answer questions of faith at home, someone else will. Another aspect that really struck me about these stories was the unexpected theme that emerged about the triumph of the family bond. After Garrett's twin, Matthew, moved to Morocco on a Fulbright scholarship, his relationship with Islam evolved and deepened. Instead of building barriers between themselves and their son, Garrett's parents planned a family trip to Istanbul, a destination rich with Islamic culture. While this trip was not without its tensions \u2014 Matthew had transitioned to a five-times daily prayer routine without mentioning it to his family \u2014 at the end of the day, the family understood that a person undergoing a spiritual transformation may not have the ability to articulate the process in detail, long-distance. Last summer, Garrett's father suffered a heart attack that called the entire family together in Connecticut. An already challenging time, Matthew was attempting his first fully-fasted Ramadan. Despite the anxiety and sadness resonating in the family, Garrett and his older brother, Jonathan, would wait until after sundown to prepare the evening meal together with Matthew. \"It was heartening to know that for a week or so, after such a rough time in Istanbul, we were able to come together as a family when we needed to and he didn't need to sacrifice anything to have that,\" said Garrett. Family support and love during a person's conversion also came up with Ian Burch. When Ian came out as gay while in the midst of religious studies in college, he wanted to explore his faith in a religion that accepted him fully. He found solace in the Episcopal Church, where he is now a priest, and his family converted alongside him. Ian said, \"My dad didn't want any part of a church that didn't love and accept his son for who he was.\" Ian said that, like many clergy members he's known, his family's support has helped him thrive.As for Solana, her conversion came at the same time that her Catholic mother left an unhappy marriage. The timing was serendipitous according to Solana. \"My mother and I became better friends through my twenties because we were both changing our lives so much and both of us had to be really understanding and open with each other. It created more communication between the two of us.\" As Rabbi Bob Levy said, \"Our affection for family members needs to be based on our affection for them and nothing else. If we only love our children when they do what we want, that's not love. That's control.\" While there is still some underlying tension around Solana's conversion with her extended family, her immediate family has embraced the transition wholeheartedly. Solana said, \"My husband, Frankie, is unaffiliated in terms of religion, yet he comes to synagogue with my daughter and I every week. It was part of our agreement; he wants me and Genevieve to feel supported in our religious choice.\" If Frankie could go to a religious service he isn't wholly invested in every week, perhaps Shaun and I could aspire to be as generous and loving to our faith-seeking family members. It seems a better option to me than having Lila move to a home filled will appliance-exorcising fanatics the first chance she gets. \"Religion is no longer prescribed or cajoled. You don't go to church because you want your neighbors to see your car in the parking lot,\" said Ian Burch. Adding: People are completely honest about what they need from faith, what they're looking for from faith, and their conflicts with faith. As a result, we're seeing more mixed-faith families than ever before. Churches have never really had to think about how to welcome complete newcomers into a space. We have to do that now. Ian is right. I honestly don't want to seem like a cultural tourist while individuals are having deep communion with their God. I want to respect and honor the numerous beliefs of every shiny person on planet Earth. But on a gut level, I'm afraid that my eyes will roll of their own accord. I'm afraid that I'll unintentionally botch a prayer. Plus, what will my atheist mother say? I'm afraid of being the outsider, the tourist, the annoying splinter that bristles out from the smooth grain. The prospect of exploring religion with my daughter terrifies me. Which convinces me that it is a pursuit worth doing. When I asked people for tips on how to feel comfortable when visiting a place of worship, I was given a lot of disparate advice. Everything from \"sit in the back\" to \"call ahead of time and explain your situation.\" Some of the advice felt right, while some just spoke to Ian's observation that religious organizations are behind the times when it comes to paving the way for newcomers. Some of the advice worth passing on is as follows: \u00b7 The Internet is your best friend. When faced with a religious ceremony or service that you're unfamiliar with, Google ahead of time for tips on what to wear, if movement is required, and how long the service will last. The latter is of particular importance if attending with a child. Plan snacks and last-call for the potty accordingly. \u00b7 Copy the people around you; allow yourself to follow. \u00b7 As you explore a faith, find a comfortable point of entry, keeping in mind that religious discovery is an evolutionary process. Perhaps the piece of advice that I found the most comforting was from Ian. \"When an emotional or rational disagreement leaves you feeling uncomfortable, take solace in the well-worn pebbles of a great tradition. The stories of the church are tales that humans have been telling themselves for hundreds of years. You're wading in a stream of tradition.\" While I don't believe in God, I do have a strong belief in the power of storytelling. I can take comfort in that. After discovering a local Universalist Unitarian church that seemed a comfortable point of entry, Shaun and I decided to allow the church into our family life if Lila's religious curiosities ever lead us there. To date, they have not. We let her know in terms I hope weren't weird and forced that we found a cool downtown church for families; Lila declined in favor of building Sunday morning blanket forts with her stuffed animals. Regardless, this decision-making process has inspired a newfound openness to familiarizing myself with the stories that have shaped my culture and modern civilization. I've learned that love can triumph over righteousness in mixed-faith families. And if Shaun and I are ever called upon to change our Sunday morning novels-in-bed routine, we're coming at it from an informed, thoughtful, and loving place.

Which convinces me that it is a pursuit worth doing.Chiropractor Diane Babalas, DC, recently graduated from the Academy of Mastery for Bio-Geometric Integration (BGI) taught by the program's founder, Sue Brown, DC. BGI is a chiropractic approach based on sacred geometry, explained Babalas, and the Academy of Mastery is a 9-module course for chiropractors with previous training in the BGI model. A chiropractor since 2000, Babalas said that she became interested in Brown's work when she was a student. The Academy of Mastery is currently the highest level of training available in BGI and Babalas is now qualified to teach beginning level courses to other chiropractors. Explaining the difference between traditional chiropractic and BGI, Babalas said that BGI examines how the spine is related to everything else in the body, including the organs and tissues. She used the concept of a geodesic dome \u2014 a sphere composed of both hard parts (like the skeleton) and soft parts (like the muscles, organs, and other tissues of the body). When force is applied to the sphere, it spreads out over the entire structure. Thinking of the human body this way, as a structure composed of hard framework and soft parts, she explained that when one part of the body is misaligned, it affects other parts as well. So, when a patient complains of lower back pain, Babalas is able to determine what other areas of the body might be misaligned and not working perfectly. By Lynda Gronlund This ongoing column features upcoming events within Ann Arbor/Washtenaw County and surrounding areas' Body/Mind/Spirit communities, new (during the past year or two) practitioners and holistic businesses, new books written by local/regional authors, new classes, as well as new offerings by established practitioners and holistic businesses. New Offerings by Established Businesses and PractitionersThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 12 Gilligan said that people interested in starting AcroY oga should try a beginner class, and that although it may seem intimidating at first, almost anyone can do it. (See article page 16 )AcroYoga Ann Arbor Jim Gilligan, Founder of AcroYoga Ann Arbor AcroYoga Photos by Doug RussellThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 13 Continued on page 14 Babalas also explained that \"every experience we have is a vibration.\" Kinetic energy, she said, can become trapped as static potential energy, creating distortions in the bones, muscles, fluids, and tissues, which can lead to pain, reduced flexibility, and other problems. A BGI trained chiropractor can address these issues using gentle touch to release patterns of tension. Babalas has used a group setting throughout her career as a chiropractor, working with several people at once, allowing one to rest while she works on another person. It can make it easier to release grief, anger, and emotional tensions when others in the same vicinity are doing it too, she explained. Starting in January of this year, she started to offer a limited number of individual sessions as well, stating that sometimes this works better for certain individuals. Babalas works with patients of all ages and addresses the usual concerns brought up by people seeking chiropractic care: back pain, headaches, depression, fibromyalgia and chronic pain, as well as ADD and autism in children. She says that about 75 percent of her clients find the work so helpful that they continue to come even after the problems that brought them in have been resolved.

Therapeutic Yoga teacher Robin Lily Goldberg is expanding healing offerings at Gyrotonic Tree Town & Pilates Loft Studio to include Reiki, Reflexology, and Reflexolo-chi. Reiki, she explained, is a \"peaceful healing practice that harmonizes energy to enhance wellbeing.\" Reflexology, she said, \"is a gentle therapeutic foot massage that re-establishes homeostasis,\" drawing on the idea that specific zones on the soles of the feet correspond with other areas of the body. Reflexolo-chi is a mix of both of these arts, combining the energetic healing of Reiki and the physical healing methods of reflexology. Goldberg has worked with a variety of health issues, from the standard aches and pains, stress and anxiety to organ transplants and knee replacements. \"I don't think there's a problem I haven't seen so far,\" Goldberg said. Like many practitioners, Goldberg became interested in Reiki and reflexology during her own health crisis and search for help. Those methods were what worked for her, and even now, she receives reflexology at least once a month. She called Reflexolo-chi \"the most personalized therapy you can possibly have,\" stating that it can \"help you tap into what your own body needs.\" As a Registered Yoga Teacher, Certified Reflexologist, and 3 rd Degree Reiki Practitioner, Goldberg uses an integrative and collaborative approach to help clients. Information about all of Gyrotonic Tree Town & Pilates Loft Studio's offerings is available at gyrotonictreetown.com. Robin Lily Goldberg can be reached via email at robinlily@outlook.com. Local counselor and dance, fitness, and Nia teacher Megan Sims has launched Me-Again Dance Healing and Fitness as an umbrella company for the services she offers in dance, movement, and wellness. As a part of Me-Again, she will provide counseling, classes, groups, and workshops. Sims holds a B.F.A. in dance from U-M and an M.A. in counseling from Goddard College. She uses her skills and training to \"help people become whole and happy in all realms of their life.\" Dance, for her, is \"great medicine, always connected to spirit. It's my therapy.\" Currently, Sims offers Nia and other classes at the YMCA, A2 Yoga, EMU, and at Great Oak Cohousing, where she lives. Nia is a 60-minute cardio dance workout combining 52 simple moves with dance arts, martial arts, and healing arts. In addition to her current Nia classes, Sims is adding \"Gentle Nia,\" which will include seated positions along with standing movements, and will be beneficial for seniors and others looking for a gentler class. Sims, newly trained in dance for people with Parkinson's disease, will also be offering a class for these patients at U-M. She also works with dementia and Alzheimer's patients using storytelling and poetry in addition to movement and dance. She said the combination can be helpful to people with memory problems because it offers not just an exercise for the mind but for the body as well. Sims runs weekend retreats and \"a weekly women's group that uses dance, meditation, fine arts, creative writing, and authentic witnessing for growth and wellness.\" As a counselor, she offers traditional talk therapy combined with movement therapy. Of her teaching/therapy philosophy, she said, \"In addition to the intrinsic healing that dance, exercise, and music bring, I create methods for us to come back into the heart of ourselves, so we can step out of class completely restored.\" A full listing of Megan Sims' offerings and class schedule is available on her website: me-againdancehealing.com.

Truskowski has changed the name of his business to BMT Wellness and is now offering healthy eating coaching in addition to massage therapy. Describing himself as \"a foodie who loves to cook and loves to help people,\" he explained that adding this service is a part of his desire to empower people to take control of their own health. He said that many people are disconnected from their bodies and what they need. Providing bodywork has been a way to help people reconnect, and now teaching people to cook with whole foods from scratch will be a way to help them reconnect to their nutritional needs. Truskowski explained that he is not a nutritionist or dietician, and thus cannot provide meal plans for people, but his service can really help those who have received a meal plan and have no idea how to implement it. He helps with every step of the process, from planning to grocery shopping to preparing the food and storing it. He works with individuals or groups of two or three, so that each person really gets to experience and understand the techniques he teaches. They participate in the meal preparation instead of just watching. \"I meet people where they are,\" said Truskowski, explaining that he is not dogmatic and does not demand that people change their diets radically all at once. He helps people take healthy steps as they are ready for them. He might start out helping someone make better shopping choices at their usual grocery store, like Kroger; then, when they are used to those changes, he might take them to Arbor Farms \u2014 where he worked for several years and learned a lot about healthy eating and cooking \u2014 or to a farmers' market, where there are more whole, plant-based food choices to choose from. For people who are busy and may think they don't have time to cook from scratch, Truskowski can help. One client really liked a rice-based meal that came in a box. Together, they worked out and made a from-scratch version of the dish, and the client concluded that since rice takes time to cook, whether it comes plain or in a box, they really weren't saving much time using the processed version. The from-scratch dish tasted better and was much healthier, too. Truskowski likes using \"one-pot cooking,\" making the cooking and clean-up process easier by including all the meal components of protein and vegetables in one dish. For busy people and families, he also teaches how to make a bunch of meals at once, or one big meal that will last for several days, and store it so that they can cook once and eat well all week. Clients can buy a two or three session healthy eating coaching package from Truskowski, which begins with a 30-minute consultation discussing goals and preferences. He can also be contracted by the hour if someone would like instruction in one or two specific dishes. Each month, he also offers a \"healthy snacking\" group class, which allows participants to try whole, plant-based snacks and learn more about how to select, prepare, and serve them.

Yoga teacher Patty Hart has begun offering one-on- one and small group Trauma Awareness Yoga for Women at her studio, Every Body Happy Yoga & Healing Center (part of the Aprill Wellness Center). As she was completing her yoga teacher certification in 2013, Hart also did a week-long training with Bessel van Der Kolk, M.D., and his Trauma Sensitive Yoga training team in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Hart explained that while yoga can be extremely helpful to people dealing with trauma, sometimes a standard yoga class can be too triggering for them to be able to relax and fully experience the practice. Things like dimmed lights, hands -on correction from the teacher, or being in proximity to other students can make the trauma survivor extremely uncomfortable, and they m ay not even have the awareness or courage to be able to express what the problem is or what they need. Hart described Trauma Awareness Yoga as an adjunct to conventional therapy. She said, in an ideal situation, she is part of the student' s therapeutic team and is in direct communication with the student' s therapist.

Hart creates the \"safest space possible in which to explore the body .\" So far, she has worked with four women on a weekly basis for six months, and she said \"their progress has been astounding .\" They are learning to \"feel what it 's like to live and fully inhabit their bodies comfortably .\" As a Trauma Awareness Yoga teacher, Hart said she has also adopted principles in her regular yoga classes to \"create greater safety .\" She really recognized the need for this type of class when, while attending a teacher training in another state , her own traumatic stress was triggered (through no intention or fault of the teachers), so much so that she went home early. Having experienced this , she is now able to intentionally create a very safe space for all of her clients. Women interested in doing Trauma Awareness Yoga with Hart can contact her to ask questions and set up an initial meeting in which Hart will show them the space and allow them to become comfortable in it, even showing them where the exits are located so they can feel open to leave at any time if they need to .

Lucia Viers graduated from the Rosen Method Open Center as a certified practitioner in May 2014. She has been studying Rosen Method Bodywork for the past eight years. She has worked with a small number of clients for the past six years and is currently transitioning into a full time practice. Viers said she found out about the Rosen Method through her sister-in -law, and was immediately drawn to it. She had been on a quest to \"be more present in her life and body ,\" and Rosen not only provided a way in which to do that but it also provided \" a path to really know how to love ,\" Viers said . She explained that Rosen Method Bodywork uses \"sensitiv e, non-manipulative touch and words to support physical and emotional awareness\" to help the recipients \"observe themselves without judging themselves.\" The practitioner helps the client notice his or her own tension without trying to fix or change it, and helps them relax and breathe through whatever feelings or memories may emerge, allowing the memories and the chronic tension they create to be released. \"When this happens we feel connected to our deeper self and a greater sense of wellbeing, and we find that more possibilities and choices become available to us.\" One of Viers' clients, in describing her experience, said that Viers \"helped me get into my body without forcing me to be there. She gently invites me to be in touch with myself and shares that experience with me.\" \"What I love about Rosen Method ,\" said Viers, \"is that it works with the whole person, and respects the deep source of healing within each of us .\" She loves to work with anyone looking to become more present in their bodies and lives, especially during times of transition, helping them to \"come back home to their authentic selves.\" She can also help with physical pain, muscle tension, and postural pr oblems. Rosen may also be useful in concert with talk therapy for people who have been through trauma. Lucia Viers can be reached by email at luciaviers @gmail .com or by phone at (734) 660-1701 .

Local author Todd Stackhouse published his first novel, The Weight, in October 2014 . The book follows ex-football player Garol Schand. In the midst of living a fairly miserable life, Schand suddenly finds himself in a sort-of Purgatory. He is in a full body cast in a town full of quirky people who each help him in their own way to \"break out of his shell.\" Stackhouse said that the story is one of self-empowerment and of learning to look at things differently. The culmination of 20 years of writing, working on the book was one thing that helped \"propel him forward\" in his own personal growth and long journey out of depression and addictive behaviors. Stackhouse described the book as \"lighthearted\" and \"wacky\" with a deeper meaning under the surface. He called it \"a comedic approach to a man's divine journey to relieve himself of the burdens of his own mind and soul.\" More information about the book is available at www.todd-stackhouse.com.

Ann Arbor taxi driver Blake Harrington, who is also a writer, artist, and musician, has self-published a book of poetry with paintings and an accompanying music CD called Enlightened Illusions. The book and CD are a collaboration between Harrington and several other artists and musicians. \"The introspective poetry combined with the stylized folk/new age music creates an integrated mind, body, and spirit experience. The reader and listener may be both deeply moved and relaxed at the same time,\" Harrington said . The poetry is his original work, and the painted illustrations are by local artist Natalie Griegorarv. The music and lyrics are written by Harrington and performed by singers Shelby Lindley, Racquel Roberts, Juanita Boykin, and Susie Oberall, with accompaniment by a professional guitarist. Jeff Michael, at local recording studio Big Sky, produced the CD, and it was digitally mastered by Bob Katz . Harrington is currently distributing the book for free online; he also gives out free hard copies to passengers in his taxi who show interest. He hopes to generate interest for a Kickstarter campaign for his next project, in which he would like to raise $20,000. He described his next project as \"truly new music for the 21st century .\" Planning to work with University of Michigan' s Pat Prouty, an expert on Motown, according to Harrington, his goal is to hire more musicians and bring everyone together for a collaborative experience.

Upcoming Events The first Great Lakes Herb Faire will be held September 11 through 13 at the Cedar Lake Outdoor Center in Chelsea, Michigan. New Classes Jim Gilligan achieved AcroYoga teacher certification in 2014, becoming the first certified AcroYoga teacher in the state of Michigan. AcroYoga, he said, is \"a partner yoga practice that blends the wisdom of yoga, the dynamic power of acrobatics, and the loving kindness of healing arts.\" Partners take turns being the \"base,\" supporting the other, and the \"flyer,\" who is lifted partly or fully into the air. To be considered for the intense 15-day residential AcroYoga teacher training set 60 miles east of San Diego, California, a number of prerequisite qualifications were required. Applicants must have received a 200-hour Yoga Teacher Training certification, attended at least two 30-hour AcroYoga Immersions, completed an additional 50 hours of studying with certified AcroYoga teachers, experienced at least 50 hours each in Yoga, Acrobatics, and Thai Massage, or another healing art, and taught in a formal group setting for at least one year. Gilligan had been practicing yoga since 1988. Explaining that he kept getting invited to conduct improv dance classes, which just didn't seem to be his thing, he was searching YouTube for videos on the subject in 2011, and stumbled across an AcroYoga video. He said he knew immediately that this was what he wanted to do. There was no AcroYoga in the area, and so he began learning from videos, a book, and anything else he could. He found another yoga teacher who was willing to work with him, and in 2012, he attended his first five-day immersion class in Atlanta, Georgia, which he described as a \"very intense, eye-opening experience.\" Being almost 50 years old, he was nervous about things like handstand practice, having had no prior experience with it. The teachers encouraged him to do it anyway. Though he had thought of himself as a \"base\" only, always staying in contact with the ground and supporting his \"flyer\" partner, the teachers had him fly, too. Of the experience, he said, \"I was changed.... There's something about having your world literally turned upside down.\"Jim Gilligan achieved AcroY oga teacher certification in 2014, becoming the first certified AcroY oga teacher in the state of Michigan. AcroYoga AcroYoga Photos by Doug RussellPedaling for Progress: U-M Graduates to Bike from San Francisco to Ann Arbor By Sandor Slomovits Next fall, if anyone asks Karin Roszell and Adam Kern, \"What did you do on your summer vacation?\" they'll have a story to tell. Actually, probably several dozen stories. That's because Roszell, who'll graduate from U-M this spring, and Kern, who graduated last year, plan to bicycle from San Francisco to Ann Arbor. They'll leave California in mid-May and anticipate that the trip will take them two to three months. They're not doing it just for the exercise \u2014 though riding 60 to 80 miles a day, four or five days a week, they'll get plenty of that. They have at least two other goals. One is to raise funds for two organizations close to their hearts. For the past three years, Roszell has been volunteering at Joy-Southfield Child Development Center, and she wants to give \"a big goodbye gift to the clinic.\" Kern traveled to Kenya in 2012 and worked at an orphanage called the Grace of God Children Center. He wants to raise funds for the Harambee Foundation, which helps Kenyan orphans to go to school. Seventy percent of all donations Roszell and Kern receive will be split between the two organizations, and 30 percent will help defray their trip expenses. For Roszell and Kern, the desire to give back to their community is a strong motivator. Though both are born and raised Ann Arborites, they, like many young people, see the whole world as their community, and so it's not surprising that they are choosing to support these organizations. But both of them also have another reason for embarking on this adventure. \"I'm seeking something that you can't learn in a classroom,\" says Roszell, who will graduate with a major in environmental science and a minor in German and eventually hopes to become a doctor. \"I've been in the library so many days of my life, and I know there's so many different ways to learn from people. I'm just really excited to get on the ground, and meet people, go to new communities and learn from real life experiences. I think we'll find a lot of wisdom from other people across the country, and I'm really excited to get that.\" Kern, who has been doing research at U-M at the School of Public Health, agrees and adds, \"We're hoping to inspire people in other communities. We want to take the time to go into communities and tell what it is we're doing. Our goal is to try to get people empowered, show them how they can use a simple passion, such as biking, to raise awareness for something they're involved with.\" To learn more about Roszell and Kern's trip and/or to donate, please visit www. pedalingforprogress.wix.com/2015.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 17 5340 Plymouth Rd.

Gilligan went on to form the AcroYoga Ann Arbor Meetup group and now leads AcroYoga playshops, classes, private lessons, performances, and jams. Recently, he and his teaching partner Sue Booth have been developing AcroYoga on a stand-up paddleboard, which Gilligan thinks they may be the first in the world to do. They will travel to Mexico this spring to teach this technique. Gilligan said that people interested in starting AcroYoga should try a beginner class, and that although it may seem intimidating at first, almost anyone can do it. Another option is to attend a jam, which begins with a mini-introduction. \"Ninety percent of jams are just play,\" he said, emphasizing that the practice is one that cultivates playfulness and community. Gilligan said that he plans to continue supporting and expanding the AcroYoga community in Ann Arbor, and hopes that it will become a regional hub that supports local, national, and international teachers and propels AcroYoga further throughout Michigan.

Yoga teacher Vicki Paglione is offering a new program at the Naturopathic School of Healing Arts: Yoga for the Special Child. The program's designer, Sonia Sumar, created it in the 70's for her daughter, who was born with Down syndrome. She found that the healing power of yoga helped children with Down syndrome, autism, cerebral palsy, ADD, and other conditions. Paglione, already a 200-hour Registered Yoga Teacher, studied with Sumar and with Kathy Randolph to become a certified Yoga for the Special Child practitioner. Paglione said that yoga can help special needs children with breath control, body awareness, cognitive awareness, balance, flexibility, and motor control. Even infants as young as two months old can benefit, with the teacher or parent moving the child's body to develop early muscle skills and flexibility. Premature infants, she said, benefit greatly from this practice. Older special needs children, said Paglione, are \"often told what they cannot do. In this program, there's nothing they can't do ... and there is no wrong way of doing it.\" Children starting the program with Paglione start out with at least one or two private sessions, so that she can teach them the basics and assess their developmental level. Some may need to stay one-on-one for a longer period of time; others are grouped by developmental level into classes. Parents interested in having their children try the program should contact Paglione to schedule an initial session. Paglione continues to teach yoga for typical students as well, and is offering a new Yin yoga class, which starts this spring. Vicki Paglione can be reached by phone at (248) 777-0081 or by email at vickipaglione@me.com. The Naturopathic School of Healing Arts is located at 7290 Jackson Road, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48103.

Wilson described the class as \"joyful, practical tools for living \u2014 healing, telepathy, relationships, children, pets, finances, spiritual growth, and more.\" The class meets for six weeks, and Wilson said dates of upcoming sessions will be announced on her website. She answered several questions for us about the new class:Vicki P aglione said that yoga can help special needs children with breath control, body awareness, cognitive awareness, balance, flexibility, and motor control.

Is your class tailored for newcomers to ideas of spirituality and intuition, or should students already have a solid background in these concepts?A. Both newcomers and those who are somewhat experienced will find it helpful and new. Q. What do you hope people will take away? A. I hope people will find v ery useful, creative, and fun ways to integrate intuition and spirituality into everyday circumstances.Q. What made you decide to put this class together? A. This is how I live my life, and I find that when I share my approaches with people, they are frequently surprised and inspired. Most of my classes are designed for those who want to be healers, but many of my tools are extremely useful for anyone who has a spiritual inclination and who would like to have things work better in their life. Living is our greatest teacher of spiritual growth; these tools are designed to help people integrate their higher self more fully into every day and to grow more into harmony with their truth through that process. Q. Do you have a favorite story of how someone's life has changed because of lessons offered in this class? A. I shar ed one of my favorite meditations with a parent of 10 children.

Called Back2Roots, the restaurant will open in late spring or early summer. It will focus on vegan, nutrition-dense foods with no artificial colors, flavors, GMOs, or any other \"industrial junk\" as Bhojani calls it. Ingredients will come from local organic farms as much as possible. The restaurant will serve a variety of fare, including burgers, bowls (which will contain a combination of raw and cooked foods), pizzas, and pastas. In a few months, said Bhojani, the location will begin serving breakfast with items such as sprouted grain crepes, a favorite of his. Raw greens and pre-sprouted beans and grains will play a big part in many of the dishes. Bhojani, a former U-M cancer researcher, explained that when he was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes and the medicine caused bad side effects, he had to learn how to manage his condition nutritionally. He changed his eating habits and was able to eliminate medications.

Conversely, eating lots of cooked and highly processed foods, he said, can contribute to inflammation, making the conditions worse. \"There are over 50 thousand published papers on cancer and inflammation,\" he said. Bhojani also named diabetes and depression as just a couple of the other conditions that are caused or exacerbated by inflammation. Bhojani's partner in Back2Roots, Pradeep Chowdhury, was diagnosed with stage four kidney cancer and given three months to live. He completely changed his lifestyle \u2014 including food, medicine, stress reduction, and exercise \u2014 and recently passed the second anniversary of that diagnosis. Bhojani said that Chowdhury believes the extra time he has been granted has a purpose: to inspire and help others with lifestyle change. Back2Roots is one aspect of this. Another plan for the future is to begin offering home delivery of meals as well as school lunches for children. For those suffering from diabetes or other conditions, Bhojani explained that they plan to put together a 14-day meal package of completely natural foods, which they believe will help patients feel better and manage their health conditions.

Jackie Miller, a certified breathwork facilitator, moved back to Ann Arbor last year, having been away since 2004. In describing what she does, she said , \"I help people to feel safe and supported while using advanced breathing techniques to evoke self- healing .\" Miller trained in Sydney , Australia, for one intensive year at Transformative Education International, to earn her Breathwork Facilitator and Behavioral Decision Processing Facilitator certifications. Currently she is one of only two people in the United States with this training. \"Advanced breathwork works on the emotional, physical, mental, and spiritual levels simultaneously ,\" she explained, helping \"bring stuff to the surface ,\" so that it can be felt, processed and healed. Miller acts as a \"compassionate witness\" to help clients feel safe and have an \"authentic emotional experience.\" She explained that getting past our own defenses against painful emotions can be difficult, and so she tries to work with people for at least three sessions to allow them to ease into the process. Miller said she especially likes to work with other healers as they tend to understand the difficulties of the process and can deeply commit to it. She added that it is a great tool to use in conjunction with other healing modalities, such as massage. The results of practicing breathwork can range from resolving old grief to gaining insight into the livelihood one would like to pursue. This summer, Miller will be working part-time out of the Center for Sacred Living, which she chose because she \"really wants clients to feel comfortable emoting without feeling inhibited.\" More information is available on Miller' s website : http ://thisbreath.com .

Recently Merilynne Rush, Reverend Melissa Ann Rogers, and Barbara Lucas joined with local clergy members and community members to form the Ann Arbor Green Burial Network (A2GBN). The group' s goals include educating people about natural burial, and increasing natural burial options in the Ann Arbor area, since currently the closest cemetery offering this service is located in Milan. Rush , who has been educating others about natural burial for quite a few years, answered some questions about the group and its purpose: Q. What is green burial and why are people interested in it? A. Green burial means going into the earth and back to the elements with as little interference as possible. No concrete grave liner, no non -biodegradable casket made of precious wood imported from far away and full of toxic resins and materials, and usually no embalming. It can also mean environmentally friendly ground maintenance practices, such as using native plants and controlled burn instead of fertilizer and mowing and pesticides. There are different levels of green. Q . Isn't cremation an environmentally friendly option? A. Some people think so. Cremation doesn't use up land but it does use about 25 gallons of natural gas . Crematory emissions may release mercury and other toxins. One has to consider many factors, such as the driving distance to the nearest green cemetery. Q . But won 't it pollute the groundwater or cause some kind of health concern? A. There is no evidence that it does. Lots of people have researched this , and I believe them. Most of our fears about dead bodies and burial, under normal circumstances, are unfounded. We have gone so far away from knowing about and accepting mortality and death as a normal part of our sphere of living that we have filled in our knowledge with many misconceptions. Q . How did you become interested in green burial? A. I first became interested in home funeral (caring for your own dead at home rather than sending the body to a mortuary). My background is as a home birth midwife, and when I learned that you could also have a home funeral, I knew it was what I wanted to do for my loved ones. That led me to green burial. Why do we do all this strange funeral and burial stuff? I was never comfortable with it. I'm glad to know that there are more natural, personal, and frankly, inexpensive, alternatives. Q . What do you think people are most surprised by when they learn about green burial? A. I think it's surprising, given the common sense of it, that there aren't more local options for it. Most people think that concrete grave liners are required by law. But they are not, in any state . They are only required by cemeteries as a matter of their own policy, due to their convenience for grounds maintenance, etc . We have built up this massive, complicated and detached system of caring for our dead. I think baby boomers are going to change all that and get back to simpler ways that are meaningful for them and in alignment with how they live their lives. *** As one of its first projects, A2GBN is collecting signatures on a petition showing the support of local people for increasing green burial options in the area. This will be used to \"demonstrate to cemeteries, congregations, and local government entities that there is a growing number of people who desire these options ,\" Rush explained. Those who are interested in signing the petition can go to Rush 's website, where there is also a wealth of information on green burial, home funerals, and listings for A2GBN meetings and Rush 's Death Caf\u00e9 events, which educate people in a conversational style about home funeral and natural burial options.

Currently, she offers a six-month program in which she meets with clients one-on -one via phone or skype to discuss concerns and challenges and give them practical steps to build healthy habits . She explained that she first helps clients build a solid foundation by having them adopt a whole-foods, plant-based diet, then eliminating allergens if needed. She also helps them examine other areas of life which impact health \u2014 stress reduction, exercise, and general happiness. \"I help people to feel safe and supported while using advanced breathing techniques to evoke self-healing. \" \u2014 Jackie Miller \"We have built up this massive, complicated and detached system of caring for our dead. I think baby boomers are going to change all that and get back to simpler ways that are meaningful for them and in alignment with how they live their lives. \" \u2014 Merilynne Rush Shelly Rawson has formed Naturally Nourished and Well, a new nutrition coaching practice. She completed her certification from the Institute for Integrative Nutrition in 2014.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 21 Rawson' s primary focus is on environmental allergies (though she can help with food allergies and sensitivities too). When she moved to Michigan six years ago , her allergies got much worse. She tried allergy shots and drugs, but nothing was really helping. She researched nutrition and changed the few bad eating habits she had due to stress, which she said made a big difference in how she felt. Whether suffering from allergies or another symptom, anyone looking to adopt better nutritional habits can benefit from Rawson' s program. \"I believe people don 't have to be sick, but most people don 't know they can take control of their health; they' re confused by all the conflicting information out there, or they can 't seem to make healthy changes stick. That' s where a coach comes in,\" she said . She emphasized that she helps people to create healthier habits \"by taking small, consistent steps , so that being healthy becomes a normal part of life instead of another thing on their to -do list.\" More information about Naturally Nourished and Well is online at www . naturallynourishedandwell.com .

Personal training and massage therapy are a second career for Curtis. She started out in user experience design, but felt a pull toward something different when she began running six years ago and grew increasingly interested in exercise, bodywork, and nutrition, first for her own needs as a developing athlete, and then for others. She attended the Ann Arbor Institute of Massage Therapy, and at the same time earned her Personal Training certificate from the American Council on Sports Medicine (ACSM). More recently, she received a Corrective Exercise Specialist certificate from the National Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM). Having knowledge in both bodywork and exercise science, Curtis is able to offer complementary services, and is often able to help people with pain and injuries get more active and fit through a combination of massage therapy and exercise instruction. She works out of Complete Chiropractic & Bodywork Therapies, where she also works with some of the chiropractic patients to add corrective exercise and bodywork to their chiropractic care . Curtis explained that she tailors sessions and services for each client depending on his or her needs and preferences. For some, she provides bodywork only, fo r others personal training only, and for others, a combination of both . Of her personal training philosophy, she says she takes somewhat of a minimalist approach, designing workouts that people can complete in their home instead of requiring them to go to a gym or training with her multiple times each week. Many clients come to her with some form of problem that has kept them from being active, which she said is often caused or characterized by muscle imbalance, and she addresses this first . Lower back pain and shoulder injury are two issues she said she sees the most. Curtis offers a free consultation to those considering working with her. She can be reached by email at ecurtis@ccbtofannarbor .com , and appointments can be booked by phone at (734) 677-1900 . Complete Chiropractic & Bodywork Therapies is located at 2020 Hogback Road, Suite 7, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48105 .

She attended school to become a nurse in Daytona Beach, Florida, and then moved to Denver. After eight years away , she returned to Ann Arbor to be closer to family, and because, she said, she missed the lakes and natural water after living near the man-made reservoirs of Denver. Still working as a nurse, she is now also a craniosacral therapist. Craniosacral therapy, Baird explained, uses manual pressure of only 5 grams (the weight of a nickel) up and down the spine. She said that the cerebral spinal fluid has its own pulse or rhythm, independent of the heart and lungs, which when restricted, can cause a number of problems, including chronic pain, eye difficulties, motor- coordination impairments, and more.

Baird currently serves children and adults; she continues to receive training in using the technique for infants and plans to be able to work with them starting next year. Baird works out of her home, and has set up an area she calls her \"Zen den,\" with a massage table, candles, aromatherapy, and a big window that lets in sun . She said that this is convenient for clients with children, since they can play while Mom or Dad is being worked on . She stated that she keeps her rates low compared to other craniosacral therapists because she wants the benefits of this treatment to be accessible to more people.

Finding Beauty in Art with Nicole Marinette Bedy Nicole Marinette Bedy has a passion for life \u2014 and living well. She loves animals, and owns and operates her own pet sitting business. She has studied five forms of healing: Reiki, Seichim, Clairvoyant, Empowerment, and Ashati. She is also an artist, having earned her degree in fine arts from Eastern Michigan University. Recently, feeling a pull toward sharing and teaching, Nicole has begun teaching Ashati Circle classes and hopes to go back to school soon to become an art teacher. \"I'll have summers off to do healing,\" she says of her future musings. \"More teaching, more art.\" I asked Nicole when she first started doing art. \"As soon as I could pick up a paint brush. My mom had lots of art supplies,\" she laughs. \"Ever since I was a young child, I enjoyed creating things with a lot of detail.\" She feels that art \"is about beauty, intelligence, detail, and energy\" and does \"not usually like art pieces that are ugly, about heavy subject matter, or hastily thrown together.\" At the moment, her favorite medium is painting, but her degree is in sculpture. \"It's hard for me to say because I really like sculpture and I really like painting!\" she concludes. Right now Nicole is working on a series of paintings, one for each of the seven chakras. \"The series is inspired by training and experiences I have had, with energy healing and intuitive development,\" she explains. Each painting uses its own unique imagery and colors while subtly incorporating the colors from the adjacent chakras, binding them all together visually and not just in name. Much of her work is clearly rooted in the sacred and spiritual. Nicole agrees that painting is one way for her to relax. She also watches movies, spends a lot of time outdoors, and meditates both formally and informally. When I asked for clarification on that, this was her wise response: \"Sometimes the best meditation is just living your life and taking a moment.\" Talking with Nicole, it quickly became apparent how open she is \u2014 to herself, those around her, and the universe. Rather than having a guiding principle, she tries to stay tuned in to what life may be offering her. \"Things change a lot. They're constantly shifting. I ground a lot, stay present in the moment. That's very important.\" She is also a woman who stays busy. Currently, Nicole is available for energy healing and psychic readings, and shares her art through her website Pine River Intuitive (where she is also putting together a newsletter). She also pops up at the occasional psychic fair around southeast Michigan. I, for one, can't wait to see her completed chakra paintings side by side hanging in a local gallery. And with the energy Nicole puts into everything she does, I have no doubt I will get my wish. If you are interested in contacting Nicole, you can find her through her website www.pineriverintuitive.com, via email pineriverintuitive@gmail.com, or by phone (810) 941-8842.Healing with Reflexology and Lisa Eidsvig Lisa Eidsvig's journey has taken her all across the globe, from Montana to Nepal, India, and Australia, where she was based for eight years working with a nonprofit training organization. \"I initially went just to do a midwifery program, which was one year long,\" she explains of her time down under. \"I ended up staying and doing more training, mostly in health care. I also helped train others. I delivered 25 babies in India and Nepal.\" What she thought would be a two-month vacation and \"visa run\" ended up turning into \"a whole new life,\" when she planted her feet here in Ann Arbor \u2014 a new city (and opposite hemisphere). Lisa is an experienced and passionate healer, and Ann Arbor is surely a richer place for having her. What brought me to Lisa was reflexology, a form of bodywork that has roots in ancient China and Egypt (Egyptian paintings have been found depicting people performing a form of reflexology). Its primary focus is on the feet, making it the best foot massage you will ever receive. In my session with Lisa, she used a subtly scented, but ever lovely, lavender oil, which she says is \"called The Universal Oil because it balances the body and works wherever there is a need, even addressing the emotional and spiritual levels.\" Adding to this a little gentle background music, and I was ready to lie back, relax, and indulge. This is a massage that I definitely felt in more than just my feet. At first, I noticed a kind of tingling warmth spreading from my right foot, where the massage began, up my leg, to gather and circulate in my center. It did not tickle at all, but rather felt soothing and pleasant. I easily slipped into a meditative state such as I have not achieved with my regular meditations in years. But I did not come out of it feeling groggy. I felt relaxed and, above all else, refreshed. The same warm tingling spread up my left side when Lisa moved on to my left foot, balancing out the sensation. 1 2 When asked what the most difficult part of the process is, she answered, \"Feeling worthy \u2014 worthy that I am capable of helping people, that I can make a difference.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May -August 2015 Page 27 Right now Nicole Bedy is working on a series of paintings, one for each of the seven chakras. \"The series is inspired by training and experiences I have had, with energy healing and intuitive development.\" 3After the session, my senses still humming and feeling cozy, Lisa and I chatted about her naturopathic studies. She is currently enrolled at NITE: Naturopathic Institute of Therapies and Education in Mt. Pleasant, Michigan. \"I learned a ton in my first year, including herbology, nutrition, muscle response testing, homeopathy, bodywork, and reflexology,\" she said. When asked what the most difficult part of the process is, she answered, \"Feeling worthy \u2014 worthy that I am capable of helping people, that I can make a difference.\" I don't think anyone can contend that Lisa hasn't already made a difference in the world. (I haven't delivered one baby, let alone 25!) May she find many more blessings on her journey of healing. And I can't wait for my next reflexology experience.

Charting the Planets with Alia Wesala Just to name a few of the things astrology juggles, we have planets, the sun and moon, houses, rising signs, degrees, angles, and nodes. Are you confused yet? You might need to see an astrologer. Once upon a time, all birth charts had to be drawn up by hand with a ruler and compass. Being of a younger generation, local astrologer Alia Wesala (who has been practicing astrology for 12 years, since she was 14) makes use of modern tools to create a birth chart, such as Astro.com, which is open to anyone, and generates the proper degrees and angles, and puts the planets in their exact places. Because astrology dates back many centuries and the positions of the stars have changed, Western Astrology (what most of us here in the U.S. are familiar with) relies more on the seasons to determine the 12 zodiac signs and not on the position of the actual constellations in the sky. The positions of the planets, however, are true to their actual positions at the time of birth. A birth chart is circular and divided up into twelve equal wedges (called houses). In my chart, the planets are all squished in the upper left quadrant, the most introspective houses. The majority of my planets are split between two signs, Sagittarius and Libra. As Alia put it, I \"have a very intense chart.\" (Most people's charts will not be so clustered. Once again I am the weird one.) From Alia, I learned that at the top of my chart is Mercury \"running the show.\" Mercury is the planet of communication, be it written or oral. This makes me a communicator. I want to share information. Nearby, perched on top of my sun, is Pluto (\"Pluto is a planet to me!\"), which turns out to also have a big impact on my chart. I have heard Pluto referred to as the planet of doom and gloom, so this revelation gave me pause. \"Pluto is calling you deeper,\" explains Alia. \"It makes you aware of the dark aspects of reality.\" Not for the purpose of melancholy, though there is that, but ultimately healing. Alia also cautions that this position can make me my own worst enemy, something I find oddly comforting. My chart showed Alia that the last five years of my life have been difficult, which is true. No need to fear, though, as the next five years are looking much brighter with many of my planets transitioning out of Scorpio (ruled by our friend Pluto), which they've been traversing for most of my life after leaving my birth sign Libra when I was three. I don't expect this brief glimpse into my chart to convince anyone of astrology's merits. I can attest Alia made my reading a lot of fun and helped me feel more at ease with where my life has been and where it is going. You can make an appointment with Alia by emailing her at astrolibration@gmail.com or calling (734) 719-0782. She also offers drop-in 20-minute readings twice a month in the Crazy Wisdom Tea Room. The majority of my planets are split between two signs, Sagittarius and Libra. As Alia put it, I \"have a very intense chart.\"Root Chakra Sacral Chakra Solar PlexusHeart ChakraThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 28 Call me a science geek: I enjoy delving into the scientific litera- ture about topics I'm interested in. This often includes looking at studies from the previous year that relate to plant-based nutri-tion. I search my favorite database for articles about vegetarian and vegan diets and then settle in for a good read. This past year's research makes the case that there are specific advantages to a vegetarian or vegan diet. A review of general nutrition that I came across from this past year is titled \"Can We Say What Diet Is Best for Health?\" (Katz, Meller) It took on the ambitious task of reviewing six major nutritional strategies, including Paleolithic, low-carb, Mediterranean, low-fat vegan/vegetarian, and a couple author's conclusion fol-lowed Michael Pollan's dictum: \"Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.\" This is an okay start, but sometimes it makes sense to say: \"Eat only plants\" or \"No meat.\" Let's take a look at some research. Heart Disease In demonstrating that plant-based nutrition has definitive advantages over other healthy eating approaches, the most important study of this past year was \"A Way to Reverse CAD?\" by Caldwell Esselstyn and his associates. CAD stands for coronary ar-tery disease, or the blockages of blood vessels to the heart. Dr. Esselstyn is a cardiol-ogist from the Cleveland Clinic. He has been using a whole food low-fat vegan diet to treat cardiovascular disease for over 25 years. The intent of this particular study was to show that people can adhere to this type of diet. The study enrolled 198 partici-pants and followed them for an average of 3.7 years. At the end of the study, almost 90 percent of the participants were still on the diet. Since this group of participants was self-selected, this is not incredibly surprising. But let's compare the two groups: those who stayed with the diet and those who resumed eating meat. In the group that discontinued the recommended plant-based diet, 10 percent died of heart disease, and 62 percent had evidence that their disease was getting worse. Among those who stayed on the vegan diet, no one died from cardiovascular disease, per-haps as many as 10 percent had some evidence of worsening health, but only one patient had a related cardiovascular incident, a stroke. The vast majority of patients, 81 percent, felt better and their heart disease improved. Some of these patients had ultrasounds of their heart that showed an actual reversal of blood vessel blockage. Physician Dean Ornish is famous for demonstrating that it is possible to reverse coronary artery disease. He did this using a vegan diet as part of a comprehensive lifestyle program. This raises the question, was it the diet or the other lifestyle changes, exercise, meditation, and group support activities? Caldwell Esselstyn dem-onstrated that cardiovascular disease could be reversed with only using a vegan diet. While medications and other therapies may be useful in \"managing\" heart disease, a low-fat vegan diet, either as part of a total lifestyle program or on its own, is the only strategy that has demonstrated actually reversing the blockages in blood vessels in heart disease. Diabetes Type II diabetes is a disease caused by excessive fat in your muscle tissues. This prevents cells from being able to use the glucose in your blood stream and results in high blood sugar. A review of vegetarian nutrition published this year states \"studies found that vegetarians have lower prevalence of type II diabetes compared with non-vegetarians.\" The review backs this up with a discussion of nine different studies. As that review was going to press, another study was being published demonstrat-ing the same principle again. In a study of 4,384 Taiwanese, among women we see diabetes almost four times as often in omnivores as in vegetarians. Among men diabetes was about two times as common for omnivores. Ten years ago, a clinical trial showed greater improvements in diabetes in groups randomly assigned to a low-fat, low-glycemic vegan diet than groups assigned to a conventional therapeutic diabetes diet. Again this past year, there was another trial showing a vegetarian diet reversing blood sugar among diabetics. A paper titled \"Ma-Pi 2 macrobiotic diet and type 2 diabetes mellitus\" (Porrata-Maury et al.) described a four-country study that used a specific macrobiotic diet (70 percent carbohydrates, 18 percent fats, and 12 percent protein) with a 40 to 50 percent rate of the diet con-sisting of whole grains. Participants had an average improvement in their blood sugar of 32 percent in the space of 21 days. Participants also lost on average five pounds. Another article published last year looks at diabetes from the other direction, argu- ing that meat consumption is a risk factor for diabetes. Looking at a number of large studies, the article shows that the risk is greatest for eating processed meats, fol-lowed by red meats, then chicken, then fish. Among vegans, diabetes is nearly half as likely compared to those who eat meat. Cancer A number of sources have suggested that a vegan or vegetarian diet may reduce your risk of cancer. But not all cancers are the same. There is relatively strong evidence that a plant-based diet protects against colorectal cancer. This past year a study from Korea compared the rates of colorectal adenomas (pre-cancerous polyps) between vegetarian Buddhist priests and omnivores from the general population. Although this doesn't strike me as an even comparison, the Buddhist priests did in fact have a lower rate of adenomas. An interesting side note is that the vegetarian Buddhist priests had a higher rate of metabolic syndrome, a precursor to diabetes. This may have to do with greater consumption of sweets among the Buddhist priests. It is cer-tainly possible to have a vegetarian or vegan diet that is out of balance or unhealthy. Alzheimer's Preliminary dietary guidelines for preventing Alzheimer's were developed and pub-lished by the International Conference on Nutrition and the Brain. These guidelines suggest avoiding saturated and trans-fats, eating vegetables, legumes, fruits, and whole grains as the staple of the diet, getting vitamin E from food, including seeds, nuts, green leafy vegetables, and whole grains, and getting adequate supplementa-tion of vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 As is typical for any year, the medical literature discussed vitamin B12 and neurologi-cal development. One review of B12 levels in vegetarians and vegans suggested that B12 supplementation is important not only for vegans but also for vegetarians. An-other review that looked at plant sources of vitamin B12 suggested that the only way plant-based food might provide enough B12 would be to eat a lot of Nori seaweed on a daily basis. For most of us, a supplement probably makes more sense. A balanced vegetarian or vegan diet is a healthy way of eating. When faced with certain diseases, a vegan diet may be the best choice, especially as it offers the only research-demonstrated way of reversing heart disease. As a health professional, I focus on sustaining and restoring my patients' health. Often a plant-based diet is a good strategy toward that goal, but that is an individual decision for my patients to make. I don't expect my patients to address issues of the environment, but changing to a plant-based diet is also more sustainable for the en-vironment. Just one example of this connection is that estimates of the greenhouse gas emissions due to livestock range from 11 percent, according to the Food and Ag-riculture Organization, to 51 percent, according to a paper by the World Watch Insti-tute. That's right, over half of all greenhouse gas effects may be caused by livestock production. While there may be more ecological ways to raise livestock, even by best estimates livestock would still have a significant impact. When the best medical care lines up with what's best for the biosphere, I'd call that sustainable medicine. Gaia Kile is a Family Nurse Practitioner with a practice in Ann Arbor.

Eccentric cut-outs collaged together create a welcoming and calm atmosphere. Tucked neatly in a corner of Ypsilanti is the warehouse that houses the successful kombucha beer company Unity Vibration and its Triple Goddess Tasting Room. Kombucha first originated in Eastern Asia, and was then introduced to Germany. Since its manifestation, kombucha has been regarded as a healthy, immune-boosting beverage. Brewing kombucha is a tedious and careful process, one that has been near perfected by Unity Vibration through years of practice and experiments. The ingredients are simple: most kombucha is made with a combination of tea, sugar, and a scoby (the key ingredient). The real work is the fermentation process. At a home-brew level, the most difficult part can be checking the vinegar component every day. For Unity Vibration's large scale operation, their biggest challenge has been getting the carbonation levels right. The scoby, or Symbiotic Colony Of Bacteria and Yeast, is the work force in the beverage. It remains a mystery even to the owners and creators of Unity Vibration, Rachel and Tarek Kanaan. \"It's a mystery even to us; no one knows exactly where it came from,\" said Rachel Kanaan. The scoby is naturally occurring, and was discovered by accident. In order to form a new scoby, pre-existing kombucha is needed. It is a floating, pancake-like living culture that works to transform the tea into the fizzy probiotic that is kombucha. \"It's so crazy \u2014 it's this lovely culture that's physical, you can see it,\" said Rachel. \"I think the really cool thing about it is that you can see different reactions with it.\" Rachel explained that the scoby thrives off of the energy around it, and at Unity Vibration, they've taken time and care to make sure their environment is one that fosters the quality kombucha they are known for. Playing music, painting the walls bright colors, playing Tibetan singing bowls, and truly valuing their employees all help to keep the energy level positive. If the employees are happy and putting good energy into the upkeep of the kombucha, they find that the scoby reacts positively.Their mantra, \"Love, health and possibility,\" is written on the side of the brewing tanks and is also inscripted on the bottles they sell. \"We wanted to put those concepts into people's minds,\" Tarek said. \"People can create whatever possibility they want in their life, and love for other people and the world.\" For Rachel and Tarek, creating possibility is a familiar concept. When the two met, Tarek was already an avid kombucha drinker, and he was impressed to find that Rachel already had a scoby in her kitchen. From there, the two started selling and giving away their own kombucha to friends. Kombucha found them, Rachel explained. They didn't seek out kombucha. They were led into starting their own company because it was getting expensive buying and selling kombucha out of the back of their van. The name came from the creative principle of combining two things into one. \"We combined both of our energies together to create the company, [and] the product is always a combination,\" said Tarek. It hasn't been easy, though. Unity Vibration's kombucha tea clocks in at .5 percent ABV, just enough to be regulated by the state and considered as beer and wine. Their kombucha wasn't tested for alcohol levels until 2010, when they were already in business. But instead of changing their recipe, they changed their approach. Now, they brew kombucha beer in addition to the tea (with some beers certainly stronger than .5 percent ABV). Tarek and Rachel found that brewing kombucha was similar to brewing Belgian beer, and that people were interested and loving their product. For the Kanaans, they were happy to be able to provide an alternative to Pepsi and Bud Light, they explained. The creation of their business came just a few months before the inception of GT Dave's Kombucha, one of the leaders in the kombucha market. Rachel and Tarek have found that they are often on the cutting edge, and with kombucha, Unity Vibration came at the perfect time. The beverage has grown massively in popularity, and is one of the fastest growing beverage markets currently. Part of this is because of the health benefits that kombucha boasts.Brewing kombucha is a tedious and careful process, one that has been near perfected by Unity Vibration through years of practice and experiments.

It's unique the feeling or energy I get from it.\" For Rachel, a cancer survivor and raw foodist, she finds that her energy levels are better when she drinks kombucha, and she is also interested in the alkalizing properties. There are few studies in the United States that show clear-cut evidence of kombucha's benefits, but the success and popularity seem to tell a different story. Rachel points out that while there may not be direct evidence in the U.S. for kombucha itself, all of the individual ingredients have proven health benefits. The vinegar-like compound is similar to apple cider vinegar, which is known for its beneficial health properties. The tea used to make kombucha is usually a green or black tea, both with health benefits that go back hundreds of years. Not to mention the local, organic fruits that Unity Vibration uses to flavor their beers. For a business that was started out of the back of a van by chance, Unity Vibration has come a long way to the nationally distributed brews that they have currently. For now, they're focusing on getting their product to this side of the country, possibly expanding their tasting room, and continuing to spread a message of love, health, and possibility through their healthy libations. Unity Vibration is located at 93 Ecorse Road, Ypsilanti, Michigan 48198. For more information, visit www.unityvibrationkombucha.com or email info@unityvibrationkombucha.com. If the employees are happy and putting good energy into the upkeep of the kombucha, they find that the scoby reacts positively. Now, they brew kombucha beer in addition to the tea (with some beers certainly stronger than .5 percent ABV).Capping bottles of raspberry Kombucha beer The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 32 Our Family Farm Setting out to write a profile of Farmer John and Our Family Farm located in Manchester, my husband, Steve, and I arrived ready to ask relatively basic questions \u2014 about the history of the farm, how the business operates overall, and those kinds of questions. However, shortly after our arrival, Steve asked a question that would take things down a path we weren't quite expecting: \"What is different from when your parents bought the farm in 1948 to now?\"The conversation that unfolded went deeper than a standard profile otherwise might have, revealing Our Family Farm's longstanding commitment to growing quality food. John Hochstetler (also known as Farmer John), a rugged figure with a white beard and hands of stone, spoke candidly at his kitchen table about the differences in food quality he's seen over his lifespan working on the farm and the problems that farmers encounter on a daily basis. He has been farming since he was six years old. \"Everything, no matter where you want to start, is totally different in this day and age. Back then, we had no GMOs. It started back in the 50's. You could see it going downhill fast,\" he said. John's education began when his parents bought the land in 1948. His wife, Lois, has been helping out since the two wed in 1978. Though the pair took sporadic breaks since the late 70's to build a family, they have remained dedicated to supplying quality food to Ann Arbor for over 15 years. Farmer John and Lois' community-supported agricultural farm is committed to growing produce using organic principles with no synthetic fertilizers or pesticides. They compare the good, organic farming chemicals to beneficial drugs like penicillin, but the bad chemicals to the likes of heroin. \"Farming you can classify like that. For instance, copper sulfate is a chemical, but it's an organic chemical you can use for fungus control. Some things like that are good to use,\" John explained. On a continuing basis, John is attending seminars to further his education on the evolution of farming. He remains an advocate of organic practices and stresses the importance of urban farming to feed a country he believes is going hungry. Reflecting on the past, John recalls a time when urban farming was commonplace. \"During World War II, it was called the Victory gardens,\" he began as we further discussed urban farming. \"Now the Victory gardens are lost. More and more people are going hungry every year. The food pantry is getting lower every year. What we really need to do is push for the community gardens to get going. You've got all this farmland out in Ann Arbor \u2014 we need to have people out there with their gardens and growing, because hunger is growing in America and gardens are not. There are so many people that are hungry and homeless. Kids need to start growing foods in schools.\" John spoke with a passion that we know is shared by fellow farmers that serve up their crop at the markets in Ann Arbor. In the corner of his old house sits a skeleton with a sign in its lap reassuring us that Our Family Farm serves food with no GMOs. In sharing his stories of eating off his own land, John said that he has cured his arthritis, and brought his blood pressure down from a number rising in the mid-300s to one that enables him to be medication-free. It is reasons like these that cause John to believe \"we are what we eat,\" and why he believes so much in the power of organic produce and getting back to our roots. It goes without saying that farming is hard work, and it's apparent to us that both John and his lovely wife Lois complete hours upon hours of strenuous work to make sure their crops are organic and fresh. When asked how many hours a week they put in, John rustled in his chair and said, \"Ah, next question.\" Lois conceded that working is constant on their farm. Our Family Farm has been a staple at the Ann Arbor Farmers' Market for more than ten years. However, due to the decline in available parking in Kerrytown, fewer people are attending the Farmers' Market, so John and Lois have had to find other ways to get their produce to the community. For the summer season, which lasts from mid-June up to November 1, they offer weekly shares, with the choice of eggs/no eggs, that allow consumers to pick up a basket of fresh produce every week or every other week (depending on which share option is chosen). Our Family Farm is also a supplier to Argus Farm Stop, another firm proponent of our local food movement. Within the hour we spent with John and Lois, our respect for Our Family Farm grew immensely. In their tone and the stories they shared, it was apparent that John and Lois will continue provide organic and nutrient- rich food for our community. \"What we like is when kids come up ... and start eating peppers, tomatoes, whatever. Because we know what's on it and what's in it. Since we had our first grandchild, it reinforces that we are doing things right.\" ### Health from the Farm, Not the Pharmacy BY SAMANTHA HART Farmer John and his wife, Lois, have remained dedicated to supplying quality food to Ann Arbor for over 15 years. \"You've got all this farmland out in Ann Arbor \u2014 we need to have people out there with their gardens and growing, because hunger is growing in America and gardens are not... \"In the corner of his old house sits a skeleton with a sign in its lap reassuring us that Our Family Farm serves food with no GMOs. Conscious Eating & NutritionThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 33 Feeling a bit sluggish or irritable? Having a hard time crawling out of bed in the morning? It's time for spring cleaning! Our body naturally makes an effort to cleanse itself in the springtime, making it an ideal time for a gallbladder cleanse. Once the gallbladder is flushed out (and this includes the elimination of gallbladder stones), then the liver and other organs in the body are free to release additional toxins, further reducing the burden on the body. The gallbladder aids in the digestion of fats, and stores and releases bile. It's a small organ that sits on the right side of the body, directly under the liver. It releases bile into the digestive track helping to stimulate peristaltic action \u2014 the process that helps the body move waste through bowels for excretion. Bile is made of several substances, including cholesterol, lecithin, and bile salts (minerals). Healthy gallbladders contribute to healthy elimination. Factors that contribute to stagnation in the gallbladder, and even in the creation of gallbladder stones, include stress, unprocessed emotions, environmental toxins, poor dietary choices, a lack of healthy fats, a lack of food-based sodium (from fruits and vegetables, and real unrefined sea salt) and an overload of unhealthy fats and certain mineral deficiencies. The following symptoms may indicate that your gallbladder is in need of a cleanse: F eeling sluggish in the morning Emotional s ymptoms, including feelings of anger, irritability, resentment, bitterness, or an excessive need to control situations Nausea, chr onic indigestion, and vomiting Back pain be tween your shoulder blades P ain in your right shoulder Maintaining a Healthy Gallbladder (Great for Liver Support As Well!) St art each morning with a tall glass of fresh warm water (or at least room temperature, not cold) with half of a fresh lemon squeezed in. Alk alize the body and encourage release of gallstones with the use of organic, unfiltered and unpasteurized cider vinegar in salad dressings, or add a teaspoon to a refreshing drink of water. A void rancid oils \u2014 this includes most vegetable oils, chips cooked in oils, high-heat fried foods, and by some accounts, any oil heated past body temperature. Use the supplemen t curcumin (an active component in turmeric), 900 to 1100 milligrams daily. Curcumin will increase the solubility of your bile. Choose a product standardized for curcuminoid content, such as Nature's Sunshine Curcumin. Consume f oods high in vegetable sodium, such as okra, celery, raw goat's milk, and grapefruit. R eplace your refined table salt with high quality Celtic or unrefined sea salt. Support health y gallbladder and liver function with a diet rich in beets, beet greens, dandelion greens, endive, yellow dock, watercress, ginger, and burdock root. R elease stored, suppressed, and unprocessed emotions that can cause stagnation or blockages within the body and that often contribute to physical ailments. Flower essences can support processing of emotions that disrupt the gallbladder (and the liver \u2014 the two go hand in hand). These emotions may include suppressed anger, bitterness, or depression. Flo wer remedies are very effective agents to support emotional release \u2014 for anger release, look to mariposa lily, pine, or tiger lily. Essen tial oils such as geranium or fennel are good places to start, applied topically over the gallbladder area. Enjo y herbal teas cleavers and chamomile.

Gary, can you tell us a little more about your new book? One of the core principles of my practice is that, for most people, health is a choice. In order for people to make that choice, they need to make the best informed decision about the many options available to help them. For the most part, allopathic medicine is focused on symptom management. Often there is little to no discussion about the origin of those symptoms. What we eat. What we put on our bodies. Where we live. All have a direct impact on our health. I wrote this book to help people increase their overall awareness of what actually influences a person's health and what can be done to live a life that assures maximum health. How can readers use this book to better their health? The book is organized into sections that relate to the various health challenges people are faced with. There is information on specific lifestyle and dietary choices that have a direct and immediate impact on one's health. Readers can find direct information that will begin to give them the resources they need to be in more control of their own healing process. The \"Revive\" section is all about the Paleo diet/lifestyle. What is the Paleo diet in a nutshell? I think a better term for the Paleo diet is the ancestral diet or caveman diet. This lifestyle was first brought to awareness in the 1800s by a dentist named Weston A. Price. It was further refined by Dr. Loren Cordain, who wrote The Paleo Diet in 2002. The premise of the Paleo diet is that human beings have been around for at least 200,000 years, and that, to some extent, our genes were affected by available food sources. So basically modern man is genetically predisposed to eat a certain way. Cavemen ate nuts, seeds, fruits, vegetables, eggs, and grass-fed animals. They did not eat grains, soy, peanuts, potatoes or much other starchy food, and certainly very little dairy. There was also no processed food or industrial seed oils like canola, peanut, and safflower oil. Still intact indigenous cultures all have very low incidents of Type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune illness, Alzheimer's disease, autism, chronic illness, and high levels of infertility. The one thing they all have in common is that they all eat in alignment to their genetic predisposition. Is it a challenge to incorporate into a modern lifestyle? That is a simple question that does not have a simple answer. It ultimately comes down to choice. Health is a choice. Is a person willing to make that choice? The one thing I hear all the time from my patients is \"I cannot give up bread and pasta.\" When I hear that, it makes me realize just how addictive grains and most carbs are. If a person eats correctly \u2014 the right balance of fats, protein, and carbs \u2014 all their cravings will simply stop. The Paleo lifestyle is flexible and accommodating. It does not have to be done organically. I am left with the old adage, \"If there is a will, there is a way.\"1. 2. 3. 4.5.What is the \"Personal Paleo Key?\"As I mentioned, the Paleo lifestyle is very accommodating. There are many aspects that affect one's level of living Paleo. Geographic location dictates available food sources. Athletes require a higher amount of carbohydrates than an average person. Age has a huge impact on health. People who are more metabolically challenged, with Type II diabetes or with high cholesterol, need to be stricter. Paleo is not about deprivation or the denial of enjoying food. There is room for some non-Paleo foods. It ultimately depends on your overall level of health. The Personal Paleo Key helps a person \"dial in\" to what their Paleo lifestyle needs to be. What are some of the most common symptoms you've seen the Paleo diet alleviate? You need to consider that 70 percent of our immune system is in our digestive system. It is implicated in many processes of illness. Eat correctly, heal the gut, and health follows. I have seen people regain their health in a relatively short amount of time. I have seen Paleo affect a woman's ability to conceive. I have seen autoimmune illness like multiple sclerosis, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis go into remission. I have seen patients with severe acne, asthma, and bronchitis get better. Eating Paleo is not the end all and be all of health. But it is certainly a critical element of regaining your health, and more importantly, staying healthy. Have you seen patients experience immediate health benefits? For most adaptors of a Paleo lifestyle, there are some immediate health benefits. There is often an immediate sense of more energy and an increased sense of wellbeing. For others, there is some short-lived physical discomfort as the body begins to detoxify. Many people experience remission of symptoms and a return of the quality life. For many, there is an adjustment period. Changing the way you eat can be a life changing event.

If you are not using flour, you can lightly blend a cooked potato into this soup later when you blend the nettles. Add whatever seasonings you like (garlic, lemon, pepper, salt). How many nettles? This can vary. Young nettles can be steamed and added whole. With older nettles, harvested beyond mid-June and into summer, use leaves stripped from the more fibrous stem; up to four to six cups, as to your taste. Toss nettles in a blanching water, drain, add to soup, and blend into a creamy green and delicious dish. Horsetail (Equisetum arvense) Horsetail is another favorite, best gathered in May or June and used in moderation. During that growth period it is a delicate plant, offering bio-available minerals and other constituents, making it useful for building stamina, reducing fatigue, and increasing energy. This plant offers nutrients particularly useful for care and healing of teeth and gums. Add to broths, which may become the base for drinks, sauces, stews, and soups \u2014 a couple tablespoons to a quart of chopped horsetail is more than enough to add nourishment to broths or to be used a couple times a week as a tea. Ethically gather horsetail in wild habitats, and easily dry and crumble to store for use for the winter. Culinary Inspiration Add horsetail, comfrey, oatstraw, nettles, and other nourishing herbs in tea form or in dried, powdered form, to your juices and smoothies! Many herbs can be juiced as well, just as a green can be juiced. I love using a couple dandelion leaves every week in veggie and fruit juice mixes. These three superfood herbs should get you started!

We are living in a time when the tide is turning, to the awareness, understanding, and acceptance of using herbs and botanicals for healing and well-being. More and more people are beginning to study the gifts of the plant kingdom, and there has also been a vast change in our understanding of diet, nutrition, food sources, and the concept of nourishment in general. Herbs are beginning to assume a broader role in our homes, beyond simply being medicinal substances in brown bottles that we take during sickness. Why limit our understanding of body nourishment to nutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, proteins, carbohydrates, and fiber? Plant sources do offer these nutrients, as well as many other nourishing constituents for our tissues, right down to the cellular level \u2014 including nourishment for body systems and cell structures, such as mitochondria, nucleus, and cell walls. There are so many plant constituents that have not been isolated and studied, yet practice-based evidence shows us that they are nourishing to humans and animals \u2014 this pursuit I call \"nutritive herbalism.\" Herbs and diet interface for our well-being, and in herbal practice, we have gathered reliable guidance over millennia with practice-based evidence and conscious living. Ready to get started? Here are some common nutritive herbs easily grown and gathered in the spring: Comfrey (Symphytum officinale ) This is a common, easy-to-grow herb, which is known to have medicinal qualities \u2014 wound healing, soothing, tissue regeneration, etc. It is used topically and internally \u2014 but I don't wait until I'm sick or injured (or someone else is) to use it. The constituents of a comfrey infusion work to build, strengthen, and heal tissue, and also to regenerate tissue all over the body. I use it for muscles, bones, colon, and other structures that would benefit from strengthening. To me, that is a nutritive process at work! If taken in moderate amounts here and there, for nourishing healing, I have seen no danger regarding \"PAs\" (pyrrolizidine alkaloids), which are present in many other (6,000-plus!) plants. As a Potherb : The late great herbalist and world traveler Juliette de Bairacli Levy suggested dicing a leaf or two into a dish of salad or potatoes. Using the leaves, stems, or flowers of a plant in food or seasoning is a common and old tradition in nutritive herbalism for herbs of all kinds, including feverfew leaves, mint leaves, chervil, borage, fennel, dandelions, and others. Also mix them with lettuces and other garden vegetables to enhance overall nutrition. Simple Comfrey Nourishing Tea: Two tablespoons of comfrey leaf per pint of boiling water. This infusion should sit for 20 minutes to an hour, and can be consumed as tea, or even used in a soup base or sauce. Try slipping a few chopped comfrey leaves into your next bone broth or vegetable broth! Nettles (Urtica dioica) Nettle is another common local and easy-to-grow plant offering deep nourishment. They contain rich stores of chlorophyll, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron, manganese, niacin, phosphorus, potassium, protein, vitamins A, C, and K, and trace minerals. I would consider them a superfood, useful in many forms, including dried, as an infusion, or cooked fresh as a potherb, similar to spinach. Use it where you would use spinach in cooked dishes: casseroles, lasagna, sauces, curries. Blanch it for smoothies to get rid of the water soluble formic acid which causes the \"sting\" of stinging nettles. Cream of Nettles Soup : Make a couple quarts of your favorite broth, and add the broth to an onion that has been chopped and saut\u00e9ed in either butter or olive oil. Add one-fourth cup of flour for a roux before adding Nutritive Herbalism: Strength, Toning, and Vitality with Our Local Herbs BY MARY LIGHT Herbs are beginning to assume a broader role in our homes, beyond simply being medicinal substances in brown bottles that we take during sickness.The constituents of a comfrey infusion work to build, strengthen, and heal tissue, and also to regenerate tissue all over the body. Conscious Eating & NutritionSinging the Praises of the New Morgan & York Everything that Crysta Coburn writes about Morgan & York is true. It's a great place for wine, cheese, chocolates and other delicious specialties. But there's more to the story. Now that it has added a caf\u00e9, with tables and chairs to sit at, it's become a wonderful neighborhood hangout. It has fine sandwiches and soups and teas and coffees, it's locally owned, and it has an original feel and personality. The people who live close to Packard and East Stadium (people living in Burns Park, Lower Burns Park, Kimberley Woods, Pattengill and \"SoPac\") now have a terrific place to enjoy, nearby. It reminds me of what Jefferson Street Market was a decade ago, for West Siders, and what Juicy Kitchen may now be for people who live in the triangle near Maple, Miller and Dexter. The new and improved Morgan & York is a perfect place to run into, and talk with, a neighborhood friend or acquaintance. It's a place to go to on an afternoon when you want to be close to home but not at home. Cozy, peaceful, lively. So, two big thumbs up for the new Morgan & York! \u2014 Bill Zirinsky, customer Great Tastes in Local Food By Crysta Coburn Morgan & York www.morganandyork.com Monday-Saturday: 7:30 a.m.-9 p.m., Sunday: 10 a.m.-5 p.m. 1928 Packard Street, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48104 \"Wine and cheese are ageless companions, like aspirin and aches, or June and moon, or g ood people and noble ventures.\" So said Michigan-born foremost food writer M. F. K. Fisher. I agree! And I regret not having stepped into Morgan & York sooner. Located near the busy corner of Packard and Stadium in Ann Arbor, it can be difficult to slow down and take in all the little businesses in that area. Morgan & York is worth it \u2014 wine, cheese, and so much more. When you walk through the door, you can see the entirety of the store and its caf\u00e9. Nothing hiding here but the gems on the shelves. Co-founder Matthew Morgan is the wine buyer. \"I enjoy finding products that have a unique voice, that carry with them a sense of the place and the vintage, which is the wine term for the harvest from a given year's crop,\" he says. Behind the ample wine displays is a corner for vinegars and olive oil, which you may sample before you buy. (In my opinion, this is the only way to buy vinegar.) Nearby you will also discover locally baked cookies, artisan jams, mustards, pastas, assorted salts, a frozen case with meats and half gallons of Calder Dairy ice cream, and a refrigerated case with craft beers, milk, and countless more items. Anything you could possibly need for a lovely dinner at home you can retrieve right here. Now for the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance (at least in my opinion), the cheese case. I am always delighted to find so many wonderful cheeses from all over the world of every age and flavor. On my latest trip, I picked up a quarter pound of Humboldt Fog, a northern California goat cheese that a friend of mine from Humboldt often raves about, and rightly so! Here you may also select different salamis to go with the cheese, wine, and other sundries that you have probably collected by now. If groceries aren't the reason for your visit, you may be inclined to stop in for a bocata (a \"European style, baguette-based sandwich\"), or soup, and a coffee or spring water. (See their online menu for the full selection.) This is a terrific spot to meet up with friends. I fell in love with the Highland Smoked Salmon, but I intend to work my way through the list, perhaps starting next with the Bresaola Artichoke and Fontina, or possibly Double Gloucester and Chutney. The Earl Grey truffles are the perfect way to end this meal. (Yes, there is also a case of handmade assorted chocolate truffles.) \"We're trying to represent products that have a unique sense of place to convey. We really aren't interested in wines or foods that taste like they could be made anywhere.... But it's really only worth doing if we can do it in a way that adds something to the community, a quality-of-life improvement for the customers and staff.\" I could not have said it better myself. Now for the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance (at least in my opinion), the cheese case... \"I enjoy finding products that have a unique voice, that carry with them a sense of the place and the vintage, which is the wine term for the harvest from a given year's crop.\" \u2014 Matthew MorganThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 37 (Morgan & York continued on next page)Tommy York and Matt Morgan, ownersConscious Eating & Nutrition\"We really aren't interested in wines or foods that taste like they could be made anywhere....

Liberty Street, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48103 Ann Arbor's newest ice cream parlour, family-owned Blank Slate Creamery, is already famous for having had to close its doors in its first three days of opening after running out of ice cream. They reopened quickly and have been ready to meet demand ever since (taking a rest for the winter, of course). Not only do they serve unique ice cream flavors such as Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla, Chocolate Covered Pretzel with Caramel Swirl, Bananas Foster, and White Chocolate Raspberry Swirl Chip, but Blank Slate tries its best to source all natural ingredients locally and provides a list of their suppliers in-store and online. The additive and hormone-free cream comes from Guernsey Farms of Northville, Michigan, coffee is supplied by Ann Arbor's own Mighty Good Coffee, and tea comes from Sweetwater Caf\u00e9, just to name a few. There is plenty of seating at Blank Slate Creamery, both inside and out. If you sit inside, you are in for another treat. Not only is the d\u00e9cor simple and fun (love the Mason jar lighting fixtures!), the walls and tables are all covered in chalkboard material. Yes, you can draw on the walls and tabletops where you are sitting, keeping both children and adults entertained. The chalk is provided by the creamery in little pails next to your seat. Just don't get so engrossed in your ephemeral creation that your ice cream melts! With as delicious as this ice cream is, that would be a real tragedy.

For mint-lovers, I recommend the Cr\u00e8me de Menthe. It's creamy with little bites of chocolate and the perfect touch of mint. For beer-lovers, there's a Malted Chocolate Stout. I confess I am not a fan of either malt or stout, but I do find that stout beers often have an undertone of dark chocolate to their flavor, so it seems natural to partner it with chocolate ice cream. If you really want to try something different, I suggest Blueberry Pancake or Fresh Basil. The former is a rich and creamy blueberry with maple, and the latter tastes exactly as the name says. I am impressed with just how much like fresh basil it really does taste! Herbs and ice cream may not be a combination well suited for the ice cream purists among us, but it offers a refreshing and smooth change of pace for the open minded. The Strawberry Balsamic might also sound like a strange combination, but I am here to assure you that it mostly tastes of ripe strawberries and is not bitter at all. The staff, in their signature black shirts and pink suspenders, are friendly and happy to answer questions and offer suggestions. Don't be afraid to ask to try a sample or two. With a wide and wonderful selection, it can be hard to choose! But oh, so satisfying. For mint-lovers, I recommend the Cr\u00e8me de Menthe.

Cross Street, Ypsilanti, Michigan 48198 I've said it before, and here it is again: Ypsilanti's Depot Town is becoming the place to be! The owner of Ma\u00edz Mexican Cantina must think so, too, as he moved his restaurant from Pittsfield Township last spring to the space formerly occupied by Woodruff's, adding some new and welcome flavor to the block. Ma\u00edz is not your typical Mexican restaurant. There is a lot of variety to the menu, and it can be difficult to choose. Build your own enchilada, mix and match three of seven varieties of taco, or go with something more classic like flautas, tamales, or sopes. And don't forget the margaritas! (Or go with something totally nontraditional, like I did, and order an Irish coffee.) Build your own enchilada, mix and match three of seven varieties of taco, or go with something more classic like flautas, tamales, or sopes. And don't forget the margaritas! But I feel like I am getting ahead of myself. Let's start at the beginning: the appetizers. After the complementary tortilla chips (colored green, orange, yellow, and blue) and salsa arrived, I decided to try the Sweet Potato Cakes, their \"aMA\u00cdZing vegetarian favorite.\" (Just to warn you, there are a number of \"ma\u00edz\" puns on the menu, such as the also AMA\u00cdZing Nachos.) Honestly, they were pretty amazing. Three grilled cakes made with sweet potato, black beans, smoked corn, cilantro and leeks. What's not to love? In the hot days of mid-summer, I can easily picture myself sitting on the patio with a margarita in hand, making my way through their starters menu, but with how flavorful the entrees turned out to be, it would almost be a shame. Though sorely tempted by the fried avocado tacos, I ended up going with the chicken tamales served in the husk with rojas sauce and beans and street corn on the side. What's street corn, you're wondering? I'm glad you asked. Because I didn't know what it was at the time, I had to order it. What arrived with my tamales and beans was half a cob of sweet corn coated in a mayonnaise with spices and herbs on top of that. (If you don't like mayonnaise, do not order this.) It is also rather messy, but I enjoyed it. Before the meal, my server was happy to explain that all food on the menu is \"prepared from scratch daily in the back,\" and only fresh ingredients are used. They also make the utmost effort to source from \"local purveyors and local ingredients,\" and all recipes are authentic. This is why the generous use of Muenster cheese in their dishes furrowed my brow. Muenster is one of my favorite cheeses \u2014 my favorite American cheese. It melts well, making it popular in quesadillas, so I don't blame them for using it, but it's decidedly German-sounding name is far removed from very Spanish rest of the menu. (Even the steak with saut\u00e9ed onions and mushrooms is called \"gringo.\") Sadly, I was too stuffed to try anything off the dessert menu, which only gives me more reason to go back. And I intend to. Especially in July. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 39 Three grilled cakes made with sweet potato, black beans, smoked corn, cilantro, and leeks.

Exploring The Scrap Box is like a treasure hunt, but you don't need a map with an \"x\" to mark the treasure. The unexpected finds are everywhere. Some of the recycled items like unique foam shapes from car manufacturing, cardboard tubes, binders, and colorful pieces of hot air balloon fabric are usually available, but there are always surprises to be discovered. Awards from a car club, vintage calendars, corks, and baseball cards from the 1990s are just a few of the unusual finds. What may look like boring gray pieces of foam or plain yellow circles to adults may have a future as a pretend rocket engine or car wheels for the children inspired to create with them. For nearly three decades, The Scrap Box has been providing the Ann Arbor community with \"creative recycling,\" allowing people to repurpose items that would normally be thrown away. All of this began with the creativity and enthusiasm of Karen Ensminger, the director who has volunteered her time since she started The Scrap Box in 1983. Initially it was open on Thursday afternoons to provide supplies to early childhood educators. It officially became a nonprofit in 1985 and has moved several times before settling in its current location, a boxy 9,000-square-foot building at 581 State Circle, off State Street in Ann Arbor, where it has remained for 15 years. Ensminger chuckled when she said she didn't realize how this organization would \"mushroom.\" After thirty years, surrounded by thousands of donations, she clearly hasn't lost her love for providing a creative outlet. The building looks deceptively small from the parking lot. Like a minivan packed methodically for a family vacation, the warehouse is strategically organized with bins, boxes, barrels, and shelves to make efficient use of the space. The main entrance leads to several smaller rooms containing buttons, scrapbook materials, wrapping paper, office supplies. The careful organization makes every item feel very purposeful. Items are carefully sorted and labeled on shelves in bins and buckets so that the volunteers can easily restock as needed. A cheerful \"rainbow\" of hot air balloon fabric lines the storage shelves guiding visitors to the workshop space. The largest room (approximately 1,750 sq. ft.) is the \"fill a bag\" room. How much for all of this treasure? The cost of filling a large paper bag (12 x 7 in.) is $7.50 and $5.00 for a small one (14 x 8.5 in.). For $25.00 a year, individuals can purchase a membership, which provides a small discount for each bag and access to the members' room, which includes use of a large paper cutter, comb bookbinding machine, and die cutting machines.A room that had been used for storage was recently painted and repurposed for drop-in workshops for adults and children. Michael Thomas, The Scrap Box's web master, organizes some of the workshops. He said the children's workshops are usually loosely themed, and the projects \"encourage creativity based on improvisation\" and provide the chance for kids to \"piece together the items in unexpected ways.\" He added that there is a \"wealth of stimulus.\" In addition to the drop-in workshops, they also host birthday parties and field trips. Projects can be brought to local schools and organizations by staff and volunteers. The Scrap Box also partners with many community organizations and regularly participates in Ann Arbor's Green Fair and Earth Day. The organization offered a children's activity at the 2014 Ann Arbor Summer Festival. Ensminger recalled doubling the number of projects and kids they anticipated. Two hundred children completed projects in the course of a couple of hours. Volunteers provide critical support to all aspects of the nonprofit's operations. They represent a broad range of ages, from as young as 14 to retirees. Volunteers stock shelves, sort donations, run the cash register, and even make sample projects. The huge number of volunteer hours helps keep costs down, but there are necessary expenses like rent, utilities, payroll for the small staff, supplies, and maintenance. Besides the donations of items and time, donations of money are especially important to the future of this nonprofit. There are several anonymous donors whose support allows The Scrap Box to keep paying its bills, but the budget is always tight. High on the priority list for this year is replacing the 2001 van that is used to pick up large donations from companies. Ensminger called the van \"the one essential ingredient we have to have.\" With well over 172,000 miles and many repairs, it has become more fiscally responsible to replace it than to keep it running. The organization's website has information about what types of household donations they can and cannot accept. Ensminger said Ann Arbor is a \"very receptive\" community for this type of nonprofit. Donors often say, \"I'm so glad you take this. I didn't want to throw it away.\" Unfortunately, people often try to avoid throwing out things that even The Scrap Box can't take. They have phased out certain household items, like cardboard paper towel rolls and plastic caps, that they once collected because they are not needed. There isn't time or volunteers to launder or rinse items. Staff member Liz Hennessey said, \"If you wouldn't let your kid play with it, please don't bring it to us.\" The Scrap Box has hours Tuesday-Saturday. No one is too young or too old to enjoy creative recycling. While you could make a quick visit, first time visitors may want to allow plenty of time for treasure hunting. Visit www .scrapbox.org to check the hours, find out about upcoming workshops, and to see what donations are accepted. The Scrap Box is located at 581 State Circle in Ann Arbor. (734) 994-0012.

Namaste, Roshani \u2014 My employer is unhappy and passive-aggressive at times and seems to constantly shift the blame onto his subordinates, including yours truly. I'm finding that I'm carrying tension in weird places, and I am willing to bet my job has a lot to do with it. Unfortunately, I can't leave for financial reasons, and I'm not sure how to deal with the nooks and crannies of my body aches either . I have a regular Surya Namaskar practice of 10 Sun Salutations every morning, but it doesn't seem to be helping my shoulders and neck much. Any suggestions on what to do for my body and, perhaps I'm stretching here (pun intended), but maybe you could even advise me on how to communicate with my boss?Jen W ., Ann Arbor Dear Jen, Kudos to you for taking deep breaths and for incorporating a regular practice of Sun Salutations in the morning! You may not realize it, but if it weren't for these two small practices, you may have a lot more than an ache in your shoulders and neck! Speaking of which, since you already seem to have a solid foundation of Surya Namaskars, I recommend you try and follow the primary sequence of Ashtanga yoga. Immediately following five rounds of Surya Namaskar-A and five rounds of Surya Namaskar-B, the primary series of Ashtanga yoga includes a fabulous standing series of postures. One asana called the Prasarita Padottanasana-C would really target the area in your shoulders where I think you may be carrying tension. A wide-legged, forward-fold stance, which involves your hands bound together with fingers clasped, this posture is proven to calm the mind; it offers a relief of stress, and best of all, it decreases neck and shoulder tension. If you have never practiced Ashtanga yoga before, please do not attempt this strictly from the text you are reading. Ann Arbor is home to some of the best Ashtangis in the West. Make sure to seek lessons from live instructors. I would suggest contacting Angela Jamison or Rachel Garcia of Ashtanga Ann Arbor. Practicing with either of them will bring you the closest you'll get to Mysore, India \u2014 the birthplace of Ashtanga yoga \u2014 without actually traveling there! All the best, RoshaniNamaste, Roshani \u2014I'm attending the Ross School of Business, and I am slowly but surely becoming a full-on insomniac. With our semester coming to a close, I can already sense I will be completely unable to fall asleep, and I just feel so drained throughout the days. I know I'm not the only one because I have friends who are students in other departments who are all pretty much going through the same thing. Though I leave my phone on silent at night, I can still sense when the light flicks on or if it's vibrating from an email, Facebook, or text notification. I feel like a zombie most days, and I just really need some advice on how to achieve a night or two of proper sleep.Sarah K., Ann Arbor Dear Sarah, Oh how I don't miss the days when I couldn't fall asleep for similar reasons. Trust me, it will get better. First things first: place your cell phone and iPad, laptops, and whatever else you have that may glow , beep, or buzz throughout the night, in another room. Our bodies are hardwired to follow a natural circadian rhythm involving total darkness at night and bright sunshine throughout the day time. If your mind can sense the light beaming from your cellphone, you've got a great body that is in tune with its surroundings! That's a good thing. If you're in an apartment with multiple students and feel like you are lacking the space to store your electronic goodies, use a closet or backpack that can muffle out any sound. Second, oftentimes the more we focus on our inability to sleep, the harder it becomes to obtain real rest. Try clearing out your floor and sitting cross-legged. Relax your face, release any tension in your jaw , neck, and shoulders, gently place your palms on your knee caps, and just breathe. Close your eyes, inhale and exhale, and release any worries about what tomorrow may bring. You can do this by simply focusing on the present moment. If you find your mind starting to wander, either bring your awareness back to your breath or YOGA COLUMN Whether you're a seasoned yogi or getting ready to roll out your mat for the first time, you'll find a variety of tips from local yoga instructor, Roshani Adhikary . Professor Brian Wansink of Cornell University has written a fascinating book entitled Mindless Eating: Why We Eat More Than We Think, which explores mindful eating and changing how we eat. Often times the more we focus on our inability to sleep, the harder it becomes to obtain real rest.... If nothing else seems to work, hop into Child's Pose with your eyes closed. Prasarita Padottanasana-Cfocus on something more tangible, like counting backwards from 100 to 1. Watch your caffeine and sugar intake throughout the day , and if nothing else seems to work, hop into Child's Pose with your eyes closed. Wishing you a dreamy slumber, Roshani Namaste, Roshani \u2014 My doctor just diagnosed me as pre-diabetic. I am overweight and doing cardio, but running and Zumba are really rough on my knees. Do you happen to know a good yoga workout DVD I can follow to lose weight?Jaya, Ann Arbor Dear Jaya, I'm hesitant to refer to yoga as a workout because I think it can offer much more than a calorie burn. There are yoga DVDs that claim to \"melt the pounds,\" but I would suggest going what may be the harder route and practicing mindfulness during your meals. Professor Brian Wansink of Cornell University has written a fascinating book entitled Mindless Eating: Why We Eat More Than We Think, which may not only shed light but perhaps even some weight off your shoulders, and then some! You may be surprised to find there are factors you hadn't considered that are influencing your eating habits and consequently , your weight gain. Roshani Adhikary is a certified yoga instructor.

Also consult your physician and see if following a more mindful diet may help you on your path to a healthier you. Wishing you luck and success, Roshani There are videos of me as a little girl singing and dancing to kids' songs, using the handle of my Fisher Price vacuum cleaner as a microphone and giving a shout-out to my dad behind the camera. When I was a little bit older, my best friend and I would spend our time together memorizing dance moves from *NSYNC videos and charging my mom and pet cat 25 cents each to watch us perform. Years later, gone was that girl, at least on the surface. Quiet, shy, anxious, insecure \u2014 that was me as a young teenager. I desperately wanted to feel good about myself, accepted by others, and fulfilled. But deep down, that little girl inside of me held the key to my healing \u2014 \"Dance!\" she whispered. I grew up in church. When I was a teenager, my parents and I had recently started attending a new church where they did worship a bit differently \u2014 they danced. I showed up to the first rehearsal of the praise dance team and sat in the back, second-guessing my presence there with every step I took to that back-row folding chair. There were a few younger girls around my age, but mostly older women and men who were strong in faith and further along in their spiritual journeys. They talked about growing in faith and sharing their faith with others through dance, and I wondered what I had to share when all I felt was nerves. Soon, we got up and did what we were there to do \u2014 dance. They turned on the music, an upbeat song called \"Shake Yourself Loose, \" a song about freedom. As we started learning the choreography and moving through space, I felt the music, not around me but within me. I moved from a place deep inside my spirit, not from my muscles and bones. I felt alive and free, just as the song described. The dance unlocked my spirit, giving me the permission to offer praise from a place of freedom, to forget about others' perceptions and just move , inside and out. All the other dancers in the room blurred to black and so did my own body \u2014 it was me and God, dancing in spirit. The Bible says, \"David danced before the Lord.\" We dance when our spirits swell with joy, love, excitement, inspiration, or even desperation, to the point that our bodies just cannot contain us anymore. We dance when the love of God pours out in our hearts, inspiring so much adoration, gratitude, and praise that words cannot express. I began to dance my freedom, my gratitude to God for relieving my anxiety and replacing it with confidence and connection with those around me. I began to dance on good days and bad. I began to dance at home, in my room, to any music, or in silence. We danced \"Shake Yourself Loose,\" among other dances, on Easter Sunday, and after that offering, the group decided to take a break. I signed up for ballet classes, suddenly obsessed with dance and desperate to learn all I could about its origins and composition and the art of classical dance. I knew how to move in spirit, but I wanted to understand how the body dances. I danced ballet four times a week, attempting to progress through a lifetime of training as a teenager thirteen years behind the classically trained student. Ballet reined in my spirit dance, allowing me to share my passion and inspiration with others, disciplining my body, and giving words to my speechless soul. Over the next several years I danced. Through college, earning a degree in psychology from the University of Michigan, I danced. And with my degree in hand, I decided to help other people facing mood disorders, life challenges or difficult transitions, through dance. I enrolled in the Dance Movement Therapy program at Lesley University, moved to Boston, and danced in a whole new way \u2014 not from my spirit or my body, but from my heart. I learned to dance my emotions, thoughts, and fears. I danced my past, present, and hope for the future. I danced my way through therapy, and learned how to help others do the same. When a family member's medical crisis ended my graduate education prematurely, I came home and danced in spirit once again. Back at home, in the midst of one of the most difficult moments in life, losing a loved one, I was looking for opportunities for my spirit to dance again. I needed spiritual refreshment and expression, and I found it in an unexpected way. The Sacred Dance Guild, an international nonprofit organization, was seeking dancers to join their Board of Directors to help promote sacred dance as a spiritual practice and a means of interfaith expression, and I became involved with the organization. And so I began dancing in work \u2014 creating initiatives to inspire others to become sacred dancers, and spreading a message of expression, inspiration, faith, and peace. Even when The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 43 Dance and Movement my body was silent, my fingers danced across the keyboard, my voice danced across the telephone lines, and my passion danced from one person to the next as I tried to spread the word of dance and faith across the globe. Now, as the reflection of my words dances in your eyes, I am no longer desperate for dance as I was as a teenager because dance is now a part of me. I don't have to dance four days a week to dance every day in spirit, heart, and work. Dance is more than movement; it is an attitude. A philosophy. We will face many challenges, losses, and unexpected turns along this road of life. Let your spirit soar, put in the extra effort, and decide to be joy-filled, inspired, and optimistic. As we travel along our individual journeys, I find it is most fulfilling to dance along the way.

Dancing Along the Way ~ One Woman's Path to Sacred Dancing By Heather Burcham Sophia Unfolds 2015 Retreat A Red Tent Weekend August 8 & 9 Windrise Retreat Center in Metamora, MI sophiaunfolds@gmail.com sophiaunfolds.com The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 44 We begin by walking \u2014 circling the room, silently connecting to the space, to each other, and to the earth beneath our feet, turning our focus inward. Judy Trautman, leader of the International Dances of Universal Peace gatherings at the Friends Meeting House in Ann Arbor, invites us to \"bridge the gap between the everyday world and the inner space you hope to achieve,\" through movement. While we walk-out our worries, we absorb \"love, harmony, and unity\" in its place. And then we dance. International Dances of Universal Peace is a movement-meditation tradition that began in the 1960s. The founder, a Sufi teacher named Samuel Lewis, felt called by God to become a minister to the hippies (\"Proof,\" he said, according to Trautman, \"that God has a sense of humor!\"), using dance instead of drugs to achieve a natural spiritual high. Lewis created 50 dances in his lifetime. Fusing folk dance and sacred mantras from many of the world's faith traditions, he created a beautiful repertoire of sacred dances. Today, there are more than 500 certified dances and hundreds of dance circles that meet around the world. This particular gathering begins with a Buddhist opening invocation, a faith tradition in which \"meditation as a group is the most meaningful,\" Trautman explained. As we begin to experience the value of group meditation firsthand, we connect with one another in space, time, movement, and voice. This community meditation experience brings a sense of warmth, peace, security, and love that is difficult to fully experience alone. Dances of Universal Peace: Gathering Locally to Experience a Collective Movement Meditation Tradition International Dances of Universal P eace is a movement-meditation tradition that began in the 1960s. By Heather BurchamPhotos by Tobi Hollander \"As we begin to experience the value of group meditation firsthand, we connect with one another in space, time, movement, and voice. \" \u2014 J udy Trautman Dance and MovementThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 45 After the invocation, everyone begins to sing and move together. Karen Varney, one of the dancers, described the moment: \"When you are singing with all the voices in the circle, the sound of the voices singing [together] sounds like one voice, and there is a shift in your self, along with the group, for we became one. I have become like a child that allows myself to feel the emotions [that arise], letting tears wash and cleanse, then becoming quiet ... knowing I am not alone in my journey of life. There is love, peace and harmony within that overflows to the outer realms of my life.\" Some movements are prayerful, many are interactive, and all are deeply spiritual. You pray and meditate, but you also find yourself laughing and having fun! Each dance holds a lesson you can take with you when you leave \u2014 a reminder of God's love, of the kind of person you strive to be, and the inner peace you hope to find in everyday life. \"I feel different things at different times,\" Melanie Fuscaldo, another regular dancer and life coach, explained. \"I see and experience the Beloved in my fellow dancers, feel my Oneness with humanity and the world, experience peace and joy and playfulness. My heart opens in gratitude and love. It's such a pleasure to sing songs of joy and love and look deeply into another's eyes and connect at the heart level. I can release the cares of the day and refocus on transcendence.\" Though the experience is different for everyone, and can vary with each gathering you attend, (even with each dance), many have a transformational experience that defines the dances for them personally. Karen Varney recounted to me one such night in particular: \"One night we did a song named 'Go Sweep out the Chambers of Your Heart,' and the leader was dancing with us. I felt this trembling in my body and wanted to run. I was dancing with the leader, and he had a hold of my hands and was looking into my eyes as the tears were falling. We changed partners and sang the song two or three more times. The shell I had around my heart was swept away that night. In the days that followed [I felt] a peacefulness and a desire to do more dances.\" Some group members have been faithful attendees for years. A warm-spirited, delightful woman named Marilyn has been attending since the mid-1990s when she first started practicing slow, meditative movement. Others have begun attending more recently. \". . . It's such a pleasure to sing songs of joy and love and look deeply into another's eyes and connect at the heart level. I can release the cares of the day and refocus on transcendence. \" \u2014 Melanie Fuscaldo Group leader Judy Trautman first got involved in the Sufi dance movement in Ann Arbor, a place that is, for that reason, very close to her heart. She was compelled to commute from Ohio, where she is the co-founder and co-chair of the MultiFaith Council of NW Ohio, to lead the group each month. The Ann Arbor group has been meeting for years, having been under the direction of at least three different leaders prior to Judy. To lead an International Dances of Universal Peace gathering, one must become certified through a mentorship process. Even current leaders are encouraged to remain connected to a mentor. Leader-in-training, Drake Meadow, has experienced the life-changing spiritual transformation the dances can evoke. His account proves that the songs and dances penetrate to the deepest parts of the soul, leaving a mark that can be drawn upon in the challenging moments of life: I believe I can say the effects of a spiritual practice of dance carry over into other aspects of life. For example, at one point, I had to undergo a surgical procedure. This was a non-invasive procedure, and was extremely safe. Intellectually, I knew this to be true. Yet, I felt nervous \u2014 to an extent, even frightened. I could feel the nervousness even in the deepest places in my body. Laying on the bed, I began, quietly, to recite a zikr. (Zikr is an Arabic word for \"remembrance\" \u2014 a short prayer said repeatedly \u2014 it is basically the same as a mantra.) Very shortly, I was calm and felt deep peace and reassurance. My body also felt at ease. A Zikr would probably have helped me in any case, but I believe the connection between spiritual and bodily practice \u2014 worked through the dances \u2014 made its effect on the whole of my being more complete. One circle dance leads to another, and time flies in the warm spirit of the group. I never felt pressured or uncomfortable. Whether you have two left feet or you've danced your whole life, your intention and presence is what matters to the people in the room, and nothing else. There is no one to impress \u2014 the group is ever-growing, ever-evolving, and they are thrilled to have you. \"There is no need for preparation or experience,\" Trautman said. \"It is a 'teach as you go' experience. All that is required is an openness of mind and heart. It is possible to meditate alongside. However, the intention is participatory rather than performance.\" You can dance, be still, bring a drum to beat on, sing or not sing, but above all, be present and be moved. The International Dances of Peace gatherings occur every first Friday of the month, from 7:00-9:00 p.m. at the Friends Meeting House, located at 1420 Hill Street in Ann Arbor. They can be reached through Judy Trautman at jltrautman@sbcglobal.net or by phoning her at (419) 475-6535.

By the time a short cello invocation is finished, anywhere from 40-90 people have arrived for the monthly Friday evening kirtan, a local tradition that just crossed the ten year mark. The lights dim and we begin to leave the world of time and tasks, roles and responsibilities behind us. Over the next two hours we become increasingly immersed in call and response chanting. Some of us sing with a full voice, others sing quietly or sit silently. There is a powerful resonance in the chorus of voices, expressions of the collective intention to dive deeper into the Inner Self. We find ourselves in the company of individuals of many religious and philosophical persuasions. There are old timers and newcomers to the practice, and individuals with every possible quality of voice. Rather than a performance, it's a timeless evening for releasing our limited sense of self, for feeling and expressing our spiritual heart. Together we are engaged in an ancient yogic spiritual practice that is both heart opening and meditative. Supported by inspiring music and the chant leaders' voices we are singing ancient Sanskrit mantras. The chants vary from slow and hypnotic to sweet and plaintiff, and at times build up to ecstatic abandon. Over the course of the evening, we find ourselves feeling calm and centered, joyous, even ecstatic. Two hours pass timelessly and the evening resolves into a few minutes of meditation. We silently savor the soulful effects of the evening. The participants, chant leaders, response singers, and musicians slowly move toward the lobby. We share homemade chai and our appreciation for the gift of an evening so lived. This is Ann Arbor Kirtan. *** Ann Arbor KirtanOur Ten Year Anniversary Continued on page 48The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 48 With much joy and gratitude Ann Arbor Kirtan recently celebrated its ten year anniversary. Over ninety participants partook in a potluck and shared strong, heart-full chanting. It's hard to believe that it's been ten years since we, two long-time friends, decided to share our common interest in meditation, mantra, and chanting in Sanskrit with the local community. Out of this intention, Ann Arbor Kirtan was born. Ann Arbor has had a long tradition of kirtan practiced by various local spiritual groups. Our vision was to bring together people who love chanting in a setting that is not affiliated with any particular spiritual tradition. Our hope was that new and experienced chanters would feel welcome and participate wholeheartedly. This hope has come to fruition. The contemporary form of kirtan in the West has been popularized by the music of Jai Uttal, Krishna Das, Ragani, Snatam Kaur, and Deva Premal. is a call-and-response practice that has become a cross-cultural musical experience. Ann Arbor Kirtan combines Indian and Western melodies and instruments, including cello, guitar, harmonium, cymbals, tabla, and kohl drum. Remarkably, over the past ten years the interest in kirtan has grown, and Jai Uttal and Krishna Das, two of the most popular kirtan singers in the West, were nominated for Grammy Awards in the New Age and World Music categories, respectfully. To meet the growing interest in the community for more opportunities to chant collectively, we initiated a kirtan on the first Wednesday of the month at one of our member's homes. On a more limited basis, Ann Arbor Kirtan has accepted invitations to participate at yoga festivals and in yoga studios. It has been a delight to be intimately involved in a growing community of chanters. Increasingly, the music lover and the spiritual seeker have come together in the soulful experience of group chanting. Within this community, we experience the profound joy of contributing to the peace and wellbeing of others and ourselves through chanting. Kirtan (pronounced key-r-tahn) comes to us from India. An ancient yogic practice that is over 5,000 years old, it is one of the oldest sacred music traditions in the world. Chaitanya Mahaprabu (1486-1533) began spreading congregational call-and-response chanting of the holy names of universal consciousness throughout India and started the Sankirtana movement that continues worldwide today. He brought chanting to the streets, to the temples, and to communities. There is a powerful resonance in the chorus of voices, expressions of the collective intention to dive deeper into the Inner Self. By Dennis Chernin, M.D., M.P.H. and Glenn Burdick, M.A.Photography by Edda Pacifico Kirtan uses mantras that have a healing and soothing effect on the body and mind. Attention to the rhythms during mantra recitation, coordinated with gentle breathing, can create a calming effect and act as a natural tranquilizer. While chanting, one learns to surrender the ego and be totally present in the moment. Singing and breathing with others makes a powerful connection with the sangha, or community, while also putting us in touch with our own divine nature. The chanting is quieting, meditative, and at the same time, moving and exhilarating. The chants call upon universal energies that serve to quiet the mind and bring us back to the center of our being. Although the language of kirtan is typically Sanskrit, on another level, it is the universal language of the heart. Thus, kirtan is part mantra and nada yoga (yoga of vibratory frequency and sound) and also bhakti yoga (yoga of devotion and the heart). During the practice of nada yoga, mantras are chanted and activate the inner chakras, the subtle energy centers within the body where physical, psychological, and spiritual forces intersect and interact. A chakra, which means wheel or circle, is seen in a deep meditative state and is experienced as an energy field. Each of the seven major chakras is associated with different parts of the body and controls and activates specific physical, emotional, and spiritual functions and attributes. For example, when chanting the names of Ganesh, the elephant deity and remover of obstacles, the first chakra is activated. On an emotional side, one can experience a greater sense of feeling grounded, stable, and connected with family and culture. When chanting the names of Krishna, the fourth chakra is stimulated, resulting in better lung and heart functioning and a greater sense of love, compassion, nurturance of one's self and others, generosity of spirit, and loving kindness. The meaning of mantra is \"an instrument to free us from the constraints of our mind.\" Its roots are deep and lie in the ancient Indian philosophical systems of Vedanta and Tantra, which hold that consciousness is intelligent, single, and complete, and the first manifestation of this unity is vibration. Human beings can experience this primal vibration in the form of the subtle sounds of mantra. Being expressions of a more complete, unified state, mantras are uniquely linked to an expanded level of consciousness. Mantra repetition can help people experience this unified state and focus the mind, making it clearer and more single pointed. Within this community, we experience the profound joy of contributing to the peace and wellbeing of others and ourselves through chanting. While chanting, one learns to surrender the ego and be totally present in the moment. Ann Arbor Kirtan Our Ten Year Anniversary Continued on page 50The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 49 Kirtan also has a relationship with Ayurveda, the ancient medical system of India, which is used to describe unique constitutional types and diagnose imbalances that lead to illness. These qualities, called doshas, are vata (air), pitta (fire), and kapha (water and earth). These subtle aspects of nature have a vibratory quality and can be influenced by the foods we eat, our lifestyles, and our mental activity. These patterns of life force can be modulated by meditation and by chanting or repetition of mantras. Yoga, meditation, mantra recitation, and kirtan can help realign the doshas, as can the invocation of certain deities. For example, kirtans for Durga, Rama, and Kali activate and balance the fire element and can thus decrease the pitta, or fire-related illnesses such as ulcers and hypertension. Chants to Hanuman, Shiva, and Saraswati rebalance vata, or the air element, and can help with problems like nervousness or tremors. Chants to Lakshmi, Vishnu, Krishna, or Ganesha can activate and balance kapha, or the water element, and can help with problems such as lethargy, fatigue, constipation, and obesity. Mantras to deities should be chanted with reverence, devotion, and intentionality. At a deeper level, an understanding of mantra chanting as an esoteric practice relates to how primal sounds affect the cells in the physical body, the breath, and the subtle qualities of the mind. In kirtan we chant the names of deities (such as Krishna or Kali), archetypal forces that represent different aspects of the consciousness that pervade our inner psyche. The deities represent the symbolic language of our collective unconscious mind and endow universal energies and forces with voices, faces, and personalities that touch us personally. These forces are symbolic and mirror the diverse attributes and functions of the seen and unseen universe. We can experience them through their different personalities, gifts, powers, and weaknesses that reflect our own qualities. When we develop a personal relationship with the deity energies, we bring forth the qualities of that deity. For example, singing to Saraswati invites greater wisdom and learning; to Lakshmi, good fortune; and to Kali, strength of character and will power. It is said that with devotion, attention, and intention, we are graced with the blessings of that deity. Ann Arbor Kirtan is a nonprofit organization of musicians who volunteer their time, come from different yogic traditions, and engage in chanting as a spiritual practice. Below, we introduce you to the chant leaders and musicians of Ann Arbor Kirtan in their own words. Each of us has had a personal experience with the power of mantra and chanting, which has led to our commitment to include chanting sacred music as part of our regular spiritual practice. Glenn Burdick - Guitar I first experienced kirtan when I met the esteemed Indian holy man named Swami Muktananda, in 1976. We would chant for several hours each day in his ashram. One day I rushed into the noon chant and took a seat. The holiness of the chant struck me immediately and an extraordinary energy began moving up my back and spine and up through my head. My whole body was vibrating, the chant was inside of me and it opened my spiritual heart. I felt ecstatic, yet humble and profoundly grateful. From that point on, chanting or repeating the mantra effortlessly brought me into a state of complete relaxation, inner stillness, and gratitude. This experience significantly changed my life and profoundly influenced my work as a psychotherapist and teacher of meditation. Being expressions of a more complete, unified state, mantras are uniquely linked to an expanded level of consciousness. \"My whole body was vibrating, the chant was inside of me and it opened my spiritual heart.\" - Glenn Burdick Across the front of the Friends Meeting House chapel are seven individuals, a cello, two harmoniums, kohl and tabla drums, and a guitar. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 50 Jai Uttal Returns to Ann Arbor June 6-7, 2015 Ann Arbor Kirtan and Crazy Wisdom Bookstore are co-sponsoring Jai Uttal in Ann Arbor, Michigan, at two public events: a kirtan on Saturday, June 6 from 7:30-9:30 p.m. at Temple Beth Emeth located at 2309 Packard Road and a half-day workshop at 2608 English Oak Drive on Sunday, June 7 from 11:00 a.m.-2:30 p.m. For more information, please contact kirtanannarbor.org or crazywisdom.net. Recently, Glenn Burdick and Dennis Chernin had the pleasure of interviewing Jai Uttal about his spiritual and musical influences. Two years ago, Ann Arbor Kirtan brought Uttal to Ann Arbor for an evening of kirtan and a day-long workshop. More than 200 participants were treated to Uttal's extraordinary devotional singing and musical gifts. Accompanied by his talented drummer, Dharma Dev, it was a 'great chant,' the kind kirtan lovers long for and continue to experience for days after. Jai Uttal is one of the most well-known and talented kirtan singers in the Western world. He was nominated for a 2002 Grammy Award in the Best New Age Album category for his CD, Mondo Rama . Uttal continues to travel internationally, where he performs and leads kirtan and teaches Indian-style music. He is also a wonderful storyteller, mixing his deep knowledge of Indian mythology with his talent for weaving stories with humor and humility. Uttal plays many instruments, including the guitar, bass, harmonica, fretless banjo, and the Indian instruments ektara, harmonium, and sarod. His beautiful and haunting voice helps the audience and participants experience the harmony of the individual and universal soul. Ann Arbor Kirtan: You were instrumental in introducing kirtan to the West as a recording artist. How did you, the son of a music company executive, come to embrace kirtan and Indian music as your life's work? Jai Uttal: I had a strong affinity to Indian music even as a child, like a karmic connection. As a teenager, I had been studying with Ali Akbar Kahn in California, living in a yoga ashram. We would do kirtan there and I would play guitar and make up melodies. At age 19, I decided to go to India, and that's where I met Neem Karoli Baba, my guru. I encountered many incredible kirtan singers in India, especially at his temple. On my second trip to India, I found the incredible Baul singers and studied with them. For me, kirtan and music are completely my spiritual path, with its graces and its challenges. Ann Arbor Kirtan: You continue to be an incubator of kirtan, conducting your Kirtan Camps in the San Francisco area in the summer and the winter camp in places like Costa Rica. People from all over (including our own Dennis Chernin) gather for a week to chant together, study Indian music, and further develop their singing and musical skills. What is your intention in conducting the camps? Jai Uttal: Kirtan Camp brings people with different needs and expectations, but the current of the kirtan creates a family by the end of the week and there are some beautiful kirtans. I am delighted if people leave and lead their own kirtans. There's a loving warmth that allows people to be uninhibited. Of course, there's always an element of this at the public kirtans and workshops. It happens exponentially more at the Kirtan Camp as people become more comfortable with their vulnerability. Ann Arbor Kirtan: How do you feel about the 'mainstreaming' of kirtan into a contemporary musical idiom, versus its traditional form as purely a spiritual practice? Jai Uttal: Some of the modern kirtan music I don't care for, but I can't really know about the depth of another musician's intention. I have great reverence and respect for the mantras and therefore feel it is good they are being repeated in any case. And for the participants, some have a calling to sing the Holy names and mantras, and others are there for something else, but they are there at the kirtan \u2014 everyone's experiences are different. And I want to honor that something. For myself, I focus on my own alignment with the deeper spirit of the chant, my own longing for God. There are challenges while leading a kirtan, such as balancing the purity of my intention with the need to have a certain amount of ego. Even in the studio I'm working my craft but still trying to make the most beautiful offering that I can with the deepest heart space possible. \"For me, kirtan and music are completely my spiritual path, with its graces and its challenges.\" -Jai Uttal \"Kirtan Camp brings people with different needs and expectations, but the current of the kirtan creates a family by the end of the Uttal Atmaram Chaitanya - Chant leader, harmonium, first time I experienced the power of kirtan was at a Swami Satchidananda center in the 70's. That's where I first chanted \"Om Namah Shivaya\" and it felt like I was having a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu of the soul. I was overwhelmed by feelings of contentment and joy and spontaneously began meditating on the mantra. I met Swami Muktananda and moved into the Ann Arbor Siddha Yoga Dham ashram where I learned to play the harmonium, tambura, and kartals. I became immersed in the practice of daily meditation, mantra repetition, and chanting. As co-director of the nonprofit Kashi Nivas Meditation Center, I continue to support the practice of kirtan in the community. Dennis Chernin - Chant leader, harmonium As a young physician, I lived in a yoga ashram at the Himalayan Institute in the late 70's and early 80's and we would chant late at night with our spiritual teacher, Swami Rama. While I didn't know it at the time, kirtan would become a major meditation practice for me many years later. On my spiritual journey, I have embraced raja yoga, the eight-fold path of meditation, as well as jnana yoga, the path of knowledge, and karma yoga, the practice of selfless service. What I felt was missing in my spiritual practice was relating in a heart-centered way to the divine and to the world around me with greater love, gratitude, and compassion. Through kirtan and bhakti yoga, I have found this connection to my heart. Continued on page 52 Ann Arbor Kirtan Continued from page 49 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 51 \"Mindfulness means paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally.\" -Jon Kabat-Zinn Check for Fall Classes Starting in September and MindfulnessMeditationMichigan.weebly.com Libby Robinson, Ph.D., MSW and Paulette Grotrian, M.A. Experienced MBSR teachers, Trained by U. Mass. Center for Mindfulness Alice Greminger - Cello My first kirtan experience was an Ann Arbor Kirtan evening. Beautiful sounds and energy filled the room, and then me, with wonder. How could simple ancient melodies and Sanskrit words give me such a deep sense of connection and peace with people I'd never met? When I started playing my cello with Ann Arbor Kirtan these experiences deepened, and kirtan gave me another gift. Our emphasis on music opening our hearts and spirits to love and connecting with each other and God freed me from a limiting over-concern with playing perfectly. Now all the music I play as a professional cellist has the spirit of kirtan. Karen Levin - Response singer, tambourine I first experienced kirtan at a kundalini yoga class in the early 1970s when I was in college and we chanted a lot of sacred Sanskrit sounds following the yoga postures. I was amazed at how joyful and yet calm it would make me feel, and I was very drawn to this practice. About five years later, I was introduced to siddha yoga and Swami Muktananda, and chanting took on a whole new meaning. I experienced it as a way to connect with the Divine, or Inner Self. It was a very powerful experience for me. Sometimes chanting can be easier than meditation, to focus on the sound, open the heart, and drop into the experience. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 52 John Churchville - Tabla drums I have been playing the tabla drums in Ann Arbor Kirtan since its first gathering. Musically speaking, kirtan at its best is a beautiful blend of Indian light classical and folk with Western music. The sound of the Indian instruments like tabla, harmonium, and other instruments is what makes this style of kirtan so inviting. The music provides the support for the singers and helps lift the chanting to very powerful levels. I personally love to be involved with kirtan for the sense of community it creates. When the chants pick up momentum, the music follows and helps push it forward. When this is done well, there is an energy that fills the room like no other I have experienced. Krishnamoyee (Cori Churdar) - Chant leader, kohl drum I began to chant Hare Krishna on beads almost immediately after hearing my first kirtan at a Hare Krishna temple 25 years ago, and have continued to balance my spiritual life with a combination of personal mantra repetition on japamala beads and group chanting in kirtan. They are both important to expanding one's spiritual journey, but chanting in congregation with others is a very powerful experience because the focus and intent of sincere practitioners enhances the experience of others. In this way, one may experience more deeply in an assembly of chanters than they might on their own. I lived in Vrindavan, India, for about eight years where I studied the kohl drum, which is a major instrument in Bengali kirtan. Ann Arbor Kirtan Continued from page 50 \"How could simple ancient melodies and Sanskrit words give me such a deep sense of connection and peace with people I'd never met?\"\" - Alice Greminger The monthly kirtan continues to be free of charge, as it has for the past ten years. We do welcome donations to help offset some of the overhead costs. We would love to have you join us! Our next kirtan events are on May 15, June 19, July 10, and August 21, 2015. We meet from 7:30-9:30 p.m. at the Friends Meeting House located at 1420 Hill Street, Ann Arbor, Michigan.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 53 What follows is an extensive interview with Coco Newton, a leading functional nutritionist in our region, exploring her nutrition philosophy and personal story. We're highlighting her in The Crazy Wisdom Journal because she has a fascinating story of slowly coming around to being integrative, at first coming from a hospital background and now working in private practice for many years. As she puts it, hers is a \"whole eater\" approach, incorporating extensive assessment and diagnostic tools. Because of this, she is utilized and respected by traditional doctors, chiropractors, osteopaths, and integrated doctors alike. Her work is not \"alternative\" or \"complementary\" per se, but perhaps upholds a new standard of care, one that has made her practice extremely successful. Coco Newton is also well-known in this region as wife and partner to Roger Newton, the Ann Arbor scientist who helped develop Lipitor, the best-selling drug in the pharmaceutical industry's history. Roger and his business partners sold their company, Esperion, in 2004, to Pfizer, for very substantial sums of money. The Newtons have become important philanthropists and proponents for many medical advancements, and they are also actively engaged in fostering greater appreciation for functional nutrition in academic and healthcare settings. Of particular relevance to this feature story, Coco has also been an important figure in the movement to change nutritional licensing standards in Michigan, and elsewhere. Kirsten Mowrey, a licensed massage therapist, Trager\u00ae practitioner, and trauma healing therapist, interviewed Coco on several occasions for this piece. Kirsten contributed a CWJ interview in the last issue (Issue #59) on how the University of Michigan is training medical doctors to have a deeper understanding of complementary and alternative medicine. An Interview with Coco Newton on Nutrition for Individualized Health The future of healthcare is going to be determined by the individual more than any single healthcare professional or institution. The Interview starts on next page 54 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 54 I first met Coco Newton over a decade ago. Back then she was raising a family, adapting to being a local celebrity (her husband, Roger, was part of the Lipitor team at Pfizer), and creating a nutritional practice focused on individual needs. Over that decade, diet, food, and food systems have been evolving in culture and healthcare. I interviewed Coco, who is a registered dietitian and certified clinical nutritionist, on a fall day at her office in the Michigan Science Innovation Center in Plymouth. Her large office windows allow in a great deal of natural light and the room is painted a warm yellow. It has space for supplements, books, and a table for consultations. Coco herself was still the petite, vibrant woman who used gestures to emphasize her speech. When I arrived, she was just completing a conference call with the Michigan Nutrition Association, an advocacy group she co-founded to address legislative efforts on the state level. What follows is a wide-ranging discussion of nutrition, diets, professional passions, and personal journeys. Kirsten Mowrey: What do you love about being a nutritionist?Coco Newton: I love when someone who is really ill, really sad, and feeling hopeless comes and has been to doctors, usually several different doctors and specialists, and are kind of on their last legs, and I love it when they get better. Their complaint is gone! Watching people transform, helping people. On the other hand, I really enjoy [that] each patient is this full mystery. You start from scratch; you don't have a road map. I develop the road map to help them. The diagnosis is just a superficial descriptor; it's the underlying processes that create this thing that we look at as a diagnosis, as a disease. One great book, Disease Delusion by Jeff Bland, [describes that] disease is just a name we give something; we are all about treating the disease, the name. Someone will say: \"What do you do for IBS or such and such diagnosis?\" People must think I have a little file folder and I pull out what I do. But no, everything starts from scratch. I love the mystery, the challenge. It's like being an investigator of the body and I'm allowed to go in and look for clues, looks for signs and symptoms, look at labs, look at the environment, hormones and exposures to find out how that's affecting their metabolism and how that can interface with their mood, their energy, their guts. It's all the factors. Kirsten Mowrey: Do you feel nutrition is well understood? Coco Newton: Getting better. Even though it might seem like more info equals more confusion. [What I] really notice about the public in the last ten years, across income, ethnicity, and age, is: I don't want to have toxic food. I think there are more and more people concerned about nutrition. I don't think it's just a left-wing hypochondriacal group. They are also willing not to put all of their trust in one person, like a physician. They are getting frustrated with doctors. I think the Internet has been fabulous for opening up ways for people to search and ask questions about their conditions in privacy. I get people who know nothing about nutrition but have read this book or that book and know there is something more. I got a call from Scotland because I was recommended in a book. This is what I mean about empowered patients: calling from Scotland! I got a call from Minnesota. A hunter, he was like a lumberjack, he was suffering with gut stuff for years. He was like 70, and he got his doctor to do the tests and he responded really quickly. That doesn't always happen, some take months and months and months, I never know what's going to happen, you know. And I tell patients, if we happen to land on it quickly, then good. But you won't see me beyond when you need to; my goal is to get you out of here really quickly. So when you have people calling like that, who have never done this before, and they are really desperate, this is the modern patient, this is the person who is going to seek out their own healthcare. They are calling the shots on who's managing it. Would you take your car back to a mechanic where it keeps breaking down? Wouldn't you get a second opinion? Historically, we have had a certain loyalty to our physicians; we keep going back to the same person even if it doesn't get better. We now hire physicians, we are not just a patient of an office; we are hiring them to do their job. That's what I tell my patients [their] first day here. They are hiring me. Kirsten Mowrey: What is a typical client visit like?Coco Newton: Someone calls my office and before I even see them, we've done a lot of work. I have a 20-page form that goes into everything: gut, dental, environmental, family history, your own history, how you are eating and food records and food habits, three years prior of labs and central. This is so important: tell me your story. I get all this technical information. I know all the meds. If they are a woman, I know what is going on with their menstrual cycle. I know the doctors they are seeing. I want to know your story. I can look at everything, but you tell me what is your story. They are clues for me. Interview by Kirsten Mowrey Photography by Linda LawsonThe Whole Eater ~ An Interview with Coco Newton on Nutrition for Individualized Health I see my work as a detective. It's amazing the way people will get behind their own lives when they need to. It's an amazing satisfaction.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 55 I see my work as a detective. Describe what was the last time you felt well. They'll leave out things in a questionnaire like \"my brother was killed in an accident and now I can't eat this food\" or \"I had this virus and I was sick for three months and I got over it, but I've never been the same.\" People often don't think about what it all means. When people start telling their story, you get much more out of that than just filling out a questionnaire. KM: First session, from intake form and face-to-face, then ordering tests?CN: I like to base my recommendations on data. I do want a complete metabolic panel, a CBC (complete blood count), inflammatory markers, vitamin D, B12, but, in addition, I might need to test this person for adrenal or that person for iodine and genomics. Get all of my thoughts about why you are here and what your goals are; what needs to be done with food, supplements; what labs I need to fill in blanks; what needs to be written to the doctor; and environmental. Those are some of the big categories. It's like a big algorithm. What questions do I still need answered? Is this a person I can do three changes with or one with all ten changes? One woman with MS, infertility, thyroid disease, depression, she was taking in a lot of aspartame (NutraSweet). I had her [stop aspartame] \u2014 do that one thing, I didn't change anything else \u2014 and she went through a classic detox. Her whole body stunk for two months, her sweat, every orifice. She went through so much detox from aspartame. Her symptoms of MS disappeared. So what did she really have? She had aspartame toxicity. No one had ever asked her about her diet. KM: What are genomics? CN: When you are looking at genetic markers, looking at how different enzymes are working in the body, [it] helps design a personalized nutrition plan. Your genetics is not your destiny. It's your environment. Epigenetics is more important than genetics. Epigenetics is [how] everything around happens around you that influences your expression and suppression of your genetic tendencies. So, for example, you could have a disease like diabetes that runs in your family, but let's say you watch your weight, eat the right food, avoid toxins, get exercise, so those genes don't get turned on. You may not express that diabetic tendency. KM: Your way of addressing those epigenetics is through what you are putting in your mouth. CN: And I link it to spirit and emotion. So, if you look at the Cheetos you bought and the organic carrots, you have kind of confusion of communication. In the beginning, I ask people to look at [what they are eating], because you never want to come with judgment. You don't want to get into that bad and good, on and off the diet. I'm helping people fine tune their health through choices. The diet mentality has judgment associated with it, [a] black and white way of thinking. Diet comes from Greek ( diaita), which means way of life. Bringing people back to caring for themselves through planning around their diet, which they've externalized \u2014 they've externalized to fast food, to vending machines, to \"we all happened to go to this restaurant so that's what I ate.\" No, you have choice. So it's very empowering. The emotional part is people start thinking about what makes them feel nurtured and what makes them feel toxic. Once you start nurturing yourself with food, I ask them to look at their whole environment: Where else are you not making choices that are not nurturing \u2014 TV, books, people \u2014 not nutritious? KM: Thich Nhat Hanh talks about this. What are you taking in through all your senses? CN: When you start to respect your body, when you see the Cheetos as a form of disrespect, not just a bad food, but a form of inflammation, a form of toxicity, then it's not like, \"Oh, I'm eating the healthy foods vs. unhealthy foods.\" You see these foods as carrying a form of energy with them that is really negative. So I really help people connect what they are doing in their world and food and wake up. And it's interesting to watch that process. People kinda get: \"Oh, if I can make choices around these things, I can make choices in areas of my life I was choosing not to make choices. I really could walk, I really could meditate for ten minutes, I can move, I don't have to be so patterned in an old pattern.\" KM: Makes sense, once you've shifted the habit energy, as Hanh calls it, the whole pattern reforms. CN: He is one of my favorites, and I have a saying of his on mindfulness and food in my folders that I give my clients the very first time. First, it is about respecting that [food] comes from someone who has grown it; it goes through many hands before it comes to you. That work and effort, and being mindful about your food when you shop, cook, eat \u2014 all of that is a gift. We've gone so far in the opposite direction in this country, you are almost rewarded for how little time you spend in the kitchen. Mealtime and eating has become a thing of the past, and I do meet people who have never had meals at home, who have never cooked. It's easy to eat and not be in the kitchen. It's a real cultural shift to bring people back to the eating world. That's a part of this too, even though it's very scientific, it's very medically oriented. It's also about creating the whole eater. I think people are really wanting that deep down. Continued on page 56Your genetics is not your destiny. The emotional part is people start thinking about what makes them feel nurtured and what makes them feel toxic.

Is it location? CN: That's the best question! So a registered dietitian is a four-year undergraduate degree and an internship, mostly in hospitals, and they have to pass an exam. Every dietitian is a nutritionist, but not every nutritionist is a dietitian. Nutritionist is someone studying nutrition beyond the institutional acute care model. The dietetics model does not teach personal biochemical individuality, it is not personalized like that, it is far more disease oriented. The nutrition training I received goes into a functional medicine approach, based first on biochemical individuality, not just looking at the absence of disease but for optimal function. It goes deep into lab evaluation and personalized care. Most of these certifications, some are through universities and some are not. There are private institutions that have sponsored these certifications... Forward thinking and mobilizing in education in nutrition is not happening at the university level, it's happening at these private institutions that are doing this. What the public needs is access to nutrition. We have, given our population in Michigan, if we only allowed dietitians to serve, we'd be serving .001 percent of the population. There're very few dietitians in private practice as opposed to institutions. KM: It strikes me that what you are talking about (certifications) parallels what is happening with food itself: patenting of seeds, and saying this seed will always go this way. CN: Just as there's no one authority on seeds, there's no authority on the future of food. It is a right. Same with where you get your information. It's unrealistic to think that people won't go online, or read books, or talk to others. People are drivers of their health now, and this is a huge shift in healthcare. It's uncomfortable for people, but it's also liberating. The future of healthcare is going to be determined by the individual more than any single healthcare professional or institution. KM: That's a profound change. CN: It's our responsibility to educate ourselves. Like guidelines for choosing a nutritionist: I would want to know the person's educational background, because if I'm going to assume there's no one place to go for a nutritionist, what are my criteria? What did you study? Where did you go? How many years have you been practicing? What are the areas where you are really confident? What are areas you don't get into? What kind of relationships do you have in the community? Do you cross refer? Do you work with anybody else? Do you evaluate lab reports and in-depth ones? Do you look at genetics? How do you charge? Do you charge for face-to-face? Do you charge for non-intervention? How do you educate about food? How much help will I get? What's your follow up? You really want to get a sense of what to expect. You want to develop a sense of trust. You want to know as a client what you are getting into. I am tenacious on behalf of a patient. If a patient needs certain labs for me to do a proper assessment, I will write a letter to the doctor and ask the patient to lobby for themselves to get those labs. KM: Will physicians order labs in response to your letter? CN: It's all about empowering the patient to be their driver, and if the doctor refuses, many patients will quit their doctor and find a new one. Patients who come here are often on their last legs. I'm seeing people coming here who are deeply sick and going down. It's amazing the way people will get behind their own lives when they need to. It's an amazing satisfaction. KM: How does nutrition fit in the allopathic model currently?CN: Not fitting really well. Twenty percent of programs offer something in medical school. [Physicians are] not tested for it on their boards. [It's] not something they have to be competent in, so unless they have an interest, they don't pursue. KM: How would you like to see that change? CN: Oh, big time. That's a lot of what I am involved in. People aren't being served in their doctors' offices. Well, first, it has to include applied nutrition in medical school. Not just recognizing deficiency: Why is this person tired but they don't have a disease? Why is this person's skin acting this way when they don't have a disease? It's never addressing the underlying issues, and that's something functional medicine does: it goes to the underlying upstream issues. It could be one upstream issue that is creating all these symptoms. KM: Can you give a real world example of that? CN: Real easy one is gluten. It can cause gut problems, skin problems, headaches, joint pain, mood disorders, so you'd be off to all the specialists and it has something to do with your diet. And you many not even know to look there. Another possibility is dysbiosis, like a yeast overgrowth, or leaky gut, and once you have leaky gut, you get immune responses all over the body. KM: Things that are big in nutrition right now \u2014 gluten free, paleo, organic, low fat \u2014 what parts of that [are helpful]? CN: There is no one diet that is good for everybody. There are elements of many of the diets that are good for everybody, but that's where you have to work with the individual because sometimes the diets come across as a religion. If you don't do this, you are not going to be healthy. There's a lot of fear-base in diets. I think it circles to some fear of, If I don't do this what's going to happen to me? I have patients who cannot tolerate any carbohydrates. If they put a cracker in their mouth they will be sick; it doesn't matter if it's gluten-free or not. They have different metabolic issues than someone else who can handle a grain. There are people that do much better on higher healthy fat diets. And paleo is not paleo is not paleo, so what is really paleo? KM: [laughs] CN: It is an idea and I don't want to get into the debate about the different diets. I'm not there. Can't you just all get a grip and look at what is best for the individual and not be ideologically attached to the point? Sometimes it feels like zealots! I will borrow this from someone else: the \"don't eat crap\" diet. What is crap? Processed, GMO, too much sugar, all the junk out there that we all know is junk.The Whole Eater ~ Continued from page 55 First, it is about respecting that [food] comes from someone who has grown it; it goes through many hands before it comes to you. That work and effort, and being mindful about your food when you shop, cook, eat \u2014 all of that is a gift. I am tenacious on behalf of a patient. If a patient needs certain labs for me to do a proper assessment, I will write a letter to the doctor and ask the patient to lobby for themselves to get those labs.I like to base my recommendations on data. There is no one diet that is good for everybody.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 57 KM: Our diets are also very regional and cultural \u2014 you are originally from California, correct? CN: Yeah, I grew up in San Francisco. My parents divorced when I was 15. I grew up in the 60's. I was a flower child. I hung out in the Haight-Ashbury, that was a big part of my childhood; I could just get on the little municipal bus on my corner and get straight there. KM: How do you think that influenced you? How did you incorporate that experience? CN: A lot, because I participated in all the peace marches. My high school was an open forum high school; the Hare Krishnas would come through, the Jesus Freaks would come through, Chinese gang wars, we had everything going on. I would cut classes to attend peace marches wherever they were in the city. I really developed my own identity. Even though I was following crowds around, I developed searching for my identity. KM: After that did you go right to college?CN: I applied to be a foreign exchange student; [Rotary] chose for me to go to India. That was before college. That was 1972. I was in Ahmedabad. I was near what back then was West Pakistan. I was on the outskirts of a city, so it was like a village. KM: Was your mom in healthcare? Had you had any exposure to Western medicine?CN: No, she wasn't. I was fascinated; I didn't know anything of India before I went. I lived and traveled with a doctor and his wife, traveled by Jeep to a village. He would go every other week to dung huts that were his surgery. I would be with him all day long and he would translate the cases into English for me. I would stand as close to him as I am to you [2-3 feet] and watch the surgery, [a] laparotomy (abdominal surgery). I watched him do a hysterectomy and [I was] swatting the flies away. That was an experience; it opened my eyes so much. I came back, I had malnutrition, I was anemic, I had worms this big in me [gestures with hands 4 inches apart]. I looked anorexic, I was pale. [The trip] grew things I couldn't intellectually capture. Open, curious, adventuresome. KM: Then you returned and went to college. That was where you got your first degree as a dietitian, yes? CN: I figured out I wanted to do something where I helped people and I wanted to have something to do with science. I liked the field of nutrition and the only way to get into it was through dietetics, but I was a fish out of water in dietetics from the very get go. The head of the department \u2014 I wanted to get an internship so I could become a registered dietitian \u2014 she told me, \"I won't write you a letter of recommendation. I don't want you in the field.\" KM: Wow! I wonder what she would say now. CN: I stayed and graduated. But I couldn't get an internship because you had to have a letter from the head of your department, so I went to graduate school, in Minnesota, and got my master's in public health and nutrition. So from California, UC Davis, to Minnesota. The rules were if you had your master's degree in nutrition, you could get an internship. You didn't need that letter of recommendation. KM: So you went to school for two years to get around this requirement. I was going to ask where Roger came in during all this? CN: We met at UC Davis, 1976. He was getting his Ph.D. in nutrition. He oversaw the labs for all the students in dietetics and nutrition. He was behind the scenes. I didn't have a clue he existed. It was the end of the semester, every department had their own potlucks, and I was going to go to the animal physiology potluck because I thought it'd be more guys, less women there, [laughing] because dietetics was purely female and I knew them all! So then this guy comes into our lab, being Roger, \"Could I please have a show of hands of who is coming to our potluck?\" I ended up going because I thought he might be there. When I got there we started talking a little bit, and he says, \"So, what did you write your term paper on?\" I rolled out the title of it: \"The Use of Intra-Lipid in Total Parenteral Nutrition.\" He looks at me and says, \"You wrote that paper?\" What hospitals had was only protein and fats in their total parenteral nutrition, which is the same as intravenous nutrition (feeding via the subclavian vein and bypassing the G.I. tract). Lipids (fats) were being used in Scandinavian countries, but hadn't come to the U.S. yet, so I wrote a paper on it in parenteral nutrition, which was cutting edge. My husband is a lipid specialist. The head of the nutrition department had handed him my paper and said, \"You've got to read this paper. It's right up your alley.\" So he read the paper, but he didn't know who I was. A year later, lipid feeding came to the U.S. KM: You were ahead of the curve! What happened after meeting Roger?CN: He asked me out a week later and we've been together ever since. He got his master's in nutrition and his Ph.D. in lipid biochemistry. It came time for him to get a job and he got offered a job at Procter & Gamble. I was in grad school working on my master's and he said, \"I've been offered a job at P&G.\" This was the time of the Rely Tampon and toxic shock syndrome was all over the news, and I said, \"I would have to be in love with you enough to marry you to go someplace like that [P&G].\" I said it sort of tongue-in-cheek, but I really didn't want to go to Cincinnati in the midst of this. He goes, \"Oh, you want to marry me!\" and that's how we got engaged, over the phone and tampons! [laughs] KM: That's great! CN: [After my master's] I did my internship in San Diego at UC San Diego. I was working in a hospital environment. From there, I did the WIC program for the County of San Diego and that was awesome. It was so fascinating. San Diego County had such a diversity of different cultures. You went someplace and it was Hmong, and another place and it was all Native Americans, or blacks or Hispanics or some places mixed. It really gave me an appreciation for interviewing people and learning about I grew up in the 60's. I was a flower child. I hung out in the Haight-Ashbury, that was a big part of my childhood...

I was fascinated with [the Hmong,] how the breakfast, lunch, dinner was all variations of the same theme. Vegetables, lots of vegetables, and onion and garlics, always rice, then either fish, chicken, or beef. It was repetitive but diverse at the same time. KM: When you'd finished with the WIC program, what next?CN: Well, I did want to work in a hospital, and I got into a small community hospital near the border of Mexico, like 120 beds. Tiny. The beauty of working in a place like that is there are not layers of bureaucracy, so if you have an idea, you can take it to the head of your department and it goes right to the administrator. As a community hospital, I had talks with the community and educational programs. And I had this fascinating interest in patients in hospitals that were basically starving to death. It was people who, say, have had different surgeries, and have to have nothing by mouth for a period of time, or they can only have clear liquids and they gradually are starving and no one really notices because you are so busy dealing with all the medical procedures. Then malnutrition sets in and it causes its own cascade of problems, infections, and poor immune system and all that. I got into the field of critical care nutrition, like I.C.U., or medical patients so ill they are malnourished. I really became interested in that and learning how to develop intravenous feedings and tube feedings. Roger was doing his post doctorate fellowship as I was doing the community hospital and the fellowship was going to end, so he accepted a job at Parke-Davis. We thought it was a five-year plan; we'd be back in California again. That was 1981. It was much more. KM: You came to Michigan and got a job at a hospital? Were you and Roger cross pollinating professionally? CN: Not then. We did teach classes on nutritional biochemistry to dietitians on the side. We started this nutrition biochemistry update. We would get a room at St. Joe's and he would talk about nutritional biochemistry and metabolism, which was fun. After that, he was in the pharmaceutical world, and for a while there I felt like we were on way opposite ends of a spectrum and there wasn't much cross pollination. I was doing dietetics, but I was still really interested in finding those starving patients in the hospital, that was my mission. I had co-started a critical care nutrition support team when I was in San Diego and I did the same thing at St. Joe's Hospital. There hadn't been a team before I and the department of surgery, critical care nursing, and pharmacy [became one]. I was really interested in that. That wasn't what I was hired for, but that's what I ended up doing and they really liked it, the doctors really liked it. It was so interesting, because nutrition was so not appreciated by physicians back then, but there were a few who got it and we really bonded. Now the dietetics department didn't get it at all.KM: That would have been 1982, this was happening? CN: 1982, and I ended up being let go by the dietetics department for insubordination, in their mind. I told the doctors and the pharmacy and the nursing department and they were aghast. They all wrote these really, really strong letters to the hospital administrator, human resources, and my department about the value of my work. There was no real insubordination, back then departments could get away with a lot without documentation, they were going to take all my benefits away, my pregnancy benefits. KM: You were pregnant with your first child? CN: Yep, my first. [Dietetics] just wanted to get rid of me because I was doing all this work that was really valuable to these patients that the dietetics department said, \"We don't deal with those patients because they are not eating.\" I'm saying: \"We deal with them because they have malnutrition. Aren't we nutritionists?\" \"No, we're dietitians.\" That's where I really felt the difference in those terms. \"We deal with people who are on diets.\" Well, who's going to deal with the people who are falling apart because they are not getting their nutrition? And many times it wouldn't be ordered until it was too late. KM: What happened? CN: They changed the leadership. My boss was demoted. They brought in a really progressive woman and I got asked to come back. KM: Did you go back?CN: I didn't go back. I think it's great they changed the chain of command there. I just didn't want to go back. I was in a different space. I had just given birth to my oldest son and was home for less than a week and I get this random phone call from a woman I had met a couple times. She had a private practice out at Ann Arbor Family Practice, she was leaving town and wanted me to take it over. I was the only person she could think of. I went there and everything had to start from scratch, just like that. I was really a typical dietitian at that point; in the hospital, I was only interested in working with high-risk people, not just the \"show someone how to eat a low fat diet.\" When I transitioned to people who not only weren't in a hospital, who just ate food and came in to be [placed] on a diet, I really didn't know what I was doing. So I found materials and developed my own style. I then became very disenchanted. I had like a mid-career, mid-life crisis. I felt that I wasn't really helping people.... I didn't feel like I was being of service to the level of purpose that I felt that I had. I felt like I was held back. KM: How soon did this happen, was this like three months, a year?CN: No, no I did a lot of things, I had two more children. I started the practice in 1983, and I started going into the identity crisis in my field in probably 1990. I just felt like it wasn't intellectually challenging. It's so formulaic; dietetics is so formulaic. I felt like I did more individual biochemistry in the hospital patients who were critically ill. I felt like I was very superficial in this [private practice]. It was all about seeing if someone gained weight, lost weight, cholesterol up or down, sugar up or down. You didn't get into pain or fatigue or medical issues \u2014 that was left for the doctors. Everything you did was from a doctor's order. I was in a physician's office and they sent me people who wanted to be on diets. KM: So what did you do?CN: I almost totally quit the field. I was looking into Ayurvedic medicine, naturopathic, homeopathy, herbal medicine. Then I started meeting people, naturopaths and others who called themselves nutritionists. They had all this enthusiasm and they were actually practicing using nutrition in their practices, using information that I had never heard. Where were they getting all this information? Why is theirs so much more sophisticated than what I'm doing? Talk about low self-esteem! I was excited for them, but I didn't even want to tell them I was in the field, I didn't know what to say. I just felt so inadequate. With that, I knew I was either going to find a way to get into nutrition somehow that felt right to me and totally change my practice or I was going to leave altogether. KM: At this point, you and Roger hadn't been working together. CN: No, Lipitor was approved in 1996, so he was in process. This was about a 10-year period, in 1994 it really crescendo-ed. I really, really felt it, but it was growing before that. In 2000, I heard Jeff Bland speak \u2014 that was a seminal moment for me, May 2000. It was a six-hour seminar he gave and I was at the edge of my seat the whole time, taking notes the whole time, every word, it was like, OMG, yeah, this is what nutrition is about. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 58 The Whole Eater ~ Continued from page 57 I was looking into Ayurvedic medicine, naturopathic, homeopathy, herbal medicine... I knew I was either going to find a way to get into nutrition somehow that felt right to me and totally change my practice or I was going to leave altogether.In 2001, I went out to the Institute for Functional Medicine... and it was like taking a sip of water from a fire hydrant... I have two sons and a daughter. They are all gluten free. Two of them really need to be and the other one plays it for a while and then he has to go gluten free.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 59 In 2001, I went out to the Institute for Functional Medicine. I was really nervous to go out there. I was so self-conscious about being so behind in nutrition. The people who are there are doctors, dentists, but you can go if you are a nutritionist. I loved it and everybody was an equal, because everyone came there to learn, and it was like taking a sip of water from a fire hydrant, so much inspiration. I came back, I was in my office, [asking] how do I implement all this? Just a step at a time, but I never turned back. I'd never left private practice. I'd slowed it down, so I began studying and taking all these courses and building my clinical skills. I became a certified clinical nutritionist in 2003. KM: How did your training affect the way your kids grew up, the food they were given? CN: I was one of the first people to go into Whole Foods when they opened here and my kids are like, \"Nobody else goes here!\" And I was like, \"There's a bar, you can go sit at the bar!\" All the enticement! That was back when they didn't understand why I never served processed food. I didn't eat like dietitians, oh gosh no! I remember when I first came to Michigan, at the University dietitians' weekly meetings \u2014 remember, I came from California, the land of granola, fruits, and flakes. I came and they had all these donuts and sweet rolls and coffee and that was all they served at these meetings and I was like, \"What is going on here!?\" I just couldn't get over it! So I was already different. KM: Did you make your kids lunches? CN: Oh I did! They all felt that there is nothing to eat at our house. \"I wanna go to so and so's house because at least their mom has things you can take out of the cabinet and peel off and eat!\" Like the Lunchables and that. \"Why do we just have food, like real food?\" I would make a homemade macaroni and cheese back then. \"We want the ones that you squirt out of the bag!\" They didn't get it then. KM: Do they get it now? Did they reconcile themselves to how you cooked?CN: Oh yeah. All of them eat really, really well. I have two sons and a daughter. They are all gluten free. Two of them really need to be and the other one plays it for a while and then he has to go gluten free. They reconciled themselves when their friends came over and said, \"Dude, you're really lucky. Yeah, I like this food, what are you complaining about?\" Their friends really loved it and it got our kids to look at me through someone else's lenses. I had peer approval for the most part. Even little things like fruit and veggies, they didn't want, they wanted cookies. My oldest is 31 now, then a 29-year-old son, and daughter, 26. When you talk about our kids and diet, our oldest son has really, really bad responses to gluten. He's never been tested for celiac. Genetically it doesn't show he has celiac but he definitely has gluten intolerance. KM: How did you find out? CN: Well, I didn't know what it was. He had aches. After eating, he felt terrible, sores in his mouth, boils, [felt] more wound up. I found out when I started functional medicine. Early 2000's, I converted my family. It was gradual. Him first, because his gut was giving him a lot of problems, it was urgent. My second son doesn't have it as bad, his gut doesn't feel good. And then my third, she would feel it in her brain, big brain fog, like someone had slipped her a drug. I must have a gluten response someplace in my body, but I don't feel it. I just don't have it in my house, for my family.KM: In November, there was a piece in The New Yorker about the increasing number of non-celiacs eating gluten free even though they are not diagnosed or testing as celiac. There is no testing evidence to support gluten sensitivity. What is your opinion? CN: Testing is a very important part of diagnosis. Unfortunately our testing is not sensitive or specific enough to give us a good diagnosis. Ideally, everybody would like to know absolutely yes or absolutely no, what is my issue with gluten? Gluten is a spectrum; celiac is the far end result of damage. Celiac disease is something you can pick up on a biopsy most of the time, but not always. You can have non-celiac gluten enteropathy, a lot of damage in your gut, even without celiac disease and it can cause the same manifestations not only in the gut but the whole body. It's really not about whether you have celiac or not, it's a spectrum and that's where I think a lot of media has looked at criticizing the popular notion that there's anything beneficial to going gluten free unless you have documented celiac disease. There are so many people who are non-celiac who are very, very sensitive to gluten to the point that it makes them ill. KM: The article talks about vital wheat gluten, a common additive in commercial bakeries. It is described as brick-like. I have heard suggestions that additives like this are the trouble \u2014 that bread is a long, slow process, and as a result of that process, it's more digestible. I have read of bakers that do a two-day rise, and, as a result, people who have a gluten allergy can eat the bread. There is a component of time. CN: I have heard that from dough to bag is a really accelerated process, hours. It's not even bread, as we know bread, which you knead and rise and punch down. Also that there is less diversity of grains and ancient grains which aren't being used and there's the processing. Although we've had processed bread for a long time, it's a question of how deeply it's been processed. Continued on page 60It's really not about whether you have celiac or not, it's a spectrum. My family was the white sliced bread company for the West Coast. My grandfather in the 1930's, Langendorf Bread. I came from sliced white bread: undo the karmic fallout! ...when people say they go off gluten and they feel a whole lot better, I don't even care if they have a blood test, they don't care. This debate over when is it real, when is it not: it's real when it happens to you and it works to be off gluten. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 60 I come from a baking family \u2014 this is so embarrassing, but it's kind of funny! My family was the white sliced bread company for the West Coast. My grandfather in the 1930's, Langendorf Bread. I came from sliced white bread: undo the karmic fallout! The way I look at it is, when people say they go off gluten and they feel a whole lot better, I don't even care if they have a blood test, they don't care. This debate over when is it real, when is it not: it's real when it happens to you and it works to be off gluten. It depends on where you are in that spectrum and what other ways your system has been assaulted through your diet. It's your immune system that's reacting, and it underlies many autoimmune diseases. I had a 62-year-old man in here and when he went off gluten, it had a stream of effects through his body. He's not diagnosed with celiac, he doesn't care. He just knows he lost all his belly fat, he is able to concentrate, and he has much better exercise tolerance. It affects his mood. KM: With food allergies, since your cases are complex, it's just part of the package? CN: Every practitioner is really different about this. First, what I like to do is go with an elimination diet in the beginning, or maybe just eliminate gluten. I try to gauge people's readiness for how much and I don't like to overwhelm people. But if you do an elimination diet, you are getting rid of the major offenders \u2014 dietary \u2014 that doesn't mean you might not be allergic to other things, but at least ruling those out. Also, what came first, the allergy or the food? If your system is immunologically challenged, if your gut is leaky or inflamed, or your pancreas doesn't put out digestive enzymes, there can be an immune up-regulation to lots of foods that come in, and that's because your immune system is so inflamed, is on such high alert, that every food can be an allergy. When you heal the gut, calm down the inflammation through diet, through herbs, through supplements, you may no longer be allergic to foods you were allergic to. There will be some that will remain. That's what you have to sift though as a nutritionist. KM: The major offenders are?CN: Gluten, dairy, eggs, shellfish, alcohol, caffeine, soy, corn, peanuts, sugar. You know, that doesn't mean you can't be allergic to a strawberry. With a strawberry though, you eat it and get an immediate effect; with the others, you get delayed effect [from major offenders]. So, we're not talking about immediate immune reactions. You have an IgE, Immunoglobulin E, response to that strawberry, but many people have delayed response, that's an IgG, Immunoglobulin G, response and those manifest, that can be 12, 24, 48 hours later. It can manifest differently: headaches, hives, G.I., fatigue. Brain fog is another. So is pain, joint pain. Those aren't immediate hypersensitivities. KM: How do you educate people about food to not simply think, I go to the grocery and there is food, but the whole cycle? CN: I do it in a non-fear-based way. If it's done in a top down, fear-based, \"You gotta do it to avoid A, B, & C,\" that's not how I talk. I really talk about being connected to our food supply, being able to appreciate the wholesomeness of a food, which is very different from good and bad. Also, that food will support you at a cellular level, into the deepest part of the body, because we often think food goes through the gut and out. I want them to think of it as something that is bringing goodness into their life, good mental and physical feeling, healing. I try to bring it into real life, I say, \"What is a good friend to you?\" A good friend is trustworthy, pretty transparent, makes me feel good, is there when I need them. There is a relationship.KM: Your clientele is already self selecting then? CN: Yes, and they are paying out of their pocket. This is a commitment. It's a personal commitment to themselves. Some people are on a really, really tight budget. They've had to maybe borrow money to do this. Some people are OK to have this in their budget, and others, it doesn't matter. But I can tell you I definitely don't cater to a wealthy clientele, not out here. [If my client is a kid,] most parents, by the time they come here, they are pretty willing. Also, food is hip now. When I was practicing just dietetics, food wasn't hip at all . Food has cach\u00e9 now. It has a lot of swag, so it's popular. It makes it easier to be a nutritionist. You know, this person comes in and they really have to eat truthfully with themselves; it can spark some real transformations. KM: Where do most of your people come from? How many clients a week?CN: This office is on the border of Plymouth and Ann Arbor. I would say I get a lot of people from Plymouth, Novi, Northville, Ann Arbor, the whole area. I also get people from Chicago, Toronto, Ohio \u2014 who drive. I also see patients international, via phone. I've been seeing patients Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. About ten a week. KM: With the rise of technology, many people are using apps to track their diet. What do you think of these, about tracking what you are eating? CN: I'm not personally into it. For patients who have their apps and bring it in, I don't discourage them. I feel eating is more than tracking carbs, fats, proteins, and that's usually what those apps are being used for, behavior modification. I'm not against them, but I never talk about it with people. Continued from page 59 The Whole Eater ~When you heal the gut, calm down the inflammation through diet, through herbs, through supplements, you may no longer be allergic to foods you were allergic to. I really talk about being connected to our food supply, being able to appreciate the wholesomeness of a food, which is very different from good and bad. [I talk to clients about how] food will support you at a cellular level, into the deepest part of the body, because we often think food goes through the gut and out.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 61 KM: What don't you like about being a nutritionist? CN: There is a passing feeling. I can feel so sad for a patient, but I would call that a challenge. The admin part is huge, having good backup and organization. Being HIPPA compliant is huge and staying on top of all those rules is huge. Paperwork, lots of paperwork. KM: What else would you like to tell us? I know you want to spend more time on ALS, which takes you back to your roots, with feeding tubes. CN: I want to do writing. I want to work with my patient, Craig Oster, who is amazing. He is someone I've been working with for a few years and he is a 20-year survivor [of ALS]. One of the things we want to do is influence the ALS Association, which currently has horrible nutritional guidelines. I mean, not based on science, actual guidelines that will make you for sure sicker. It's full of very processed foods: put all the Hershey's syrup on it because all you really have worry about is calories. We want to have a talk with the ALS Association. We're involved in a book and a film ( www .healingals.com ) on patients around the country, who, in different ways, cleaned up their diets and detoxified, brought in supplements and mind body techniques who have reversed their ALS. I worked with one ex-NFL player who had ALS. He looked like he was blown up like a balloon, he had diabetes, was insulin dependent, and he had ALS and gut problems. He was tube feeding, like Ensure. All I did was find a whole foods tube feeding, genuine tube feeding, switched him from processed to whole foods, and he no longer has diabetes, he no longer takes insulin, his gut is good, and his face looks like a face. He may have not reversed his ALS per se, but his quality of life has improved. But if you were to look in a dietetics textbook, they are going to say that all you need to pay attention to are calories, and they [patients] are going to live 2-5 years. It's a death sentence, ALS is a death sentence. But what we've learned from my patients is you detoxify, you bring in nutrients and foods that support the nervous system that are anti-inflammatory and allergenic, you can do a heck of a lot. This is a real example. I'm very much in service, because we are going to go to bat with the ALS Association, myself and some other neurologists helping to get the guidelines changed for ALS. They are back in the 70's. Let me show you one thing \u2014 it's like a time warp \u2014 now if they've changed it, because we've been talking to the media [goes to computer and looks]: \"Maintaining good nutrition with ALS \u2014 document from 1999 , last time updated!\" Everything in here is processed food. Everything! Canned fruit, ready to eat cereal, instant breakfast milk, canned soup, dry milk powder, \"foods high in fat and sugar are good sources of calories,\" margarine! \"Add syrup!\" KM: This must make you This is what we are up against: \"add commercial thickening powders to soups,\" \"prepare food with Jell-O.\" You could say this about any disease, especially the neurological diseases: Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, MS. I am really ready to focus on this and am constantly doing research. KM: Has your work coincided again with Roger's, as you get into individual biochemistry? CN: Roger and I started coming together again when I started getting into functional medicine. It was getting into nutritional biochemistry again. Straight up dietetics doesn't really get very deep, but when you get into functional medicine you are really getting into individual biochemistry. ...We are both advocates for more people being educated in functional medicine, especially dietitians, as they can be the carrier molecules of this information. Right now you look at most institutions, which is where dietitians are, [and] we need functional medicine to be the standard of care, not something you have to pay extra for, outside of the system. A big part of our work together has been supporting programs and helping to organize programs to bring a change in dietetics education. KM: Is this like seminars you did at St. Joe's?CN: In a bigger way, we are trying to get changes across the country. We've been working with KU (University of Kansas), because they have a really strong integrative medicine program... What we did is we organized and helped support a connection and a working together of the Integrative Medicine program with the Department of Dietetics to bring dietetic interns and students into the world of integrative and functional medicine. Because they don't get exposed.One of the things we want to do is influence the ALS Association, which currently has horrible nutritional guidelines. It's a death sentence, ALS is a death sentence. But what we've learned from my patients is you detoxify, you bring in nutrients and foods that support the nervous system that are anti-inflammatory and allergenic, you can do a heck of a lot.KM: Are you teaching those younger nutritionists? CN: I have been involved in teaching, but I'm not teaching at KU. But I have been involved in the curriculum planning and in setting a standard. Because this is how I look at it: everyone should be looked at as an individual. Dietitians are not taught individualized nutrition, it's very cookbook: If you have diabetes, you give the diabetes diet. And it's still taught that way. What we want to inspire and get done is a ground swelling, from the ground up, a demand by departments and dietitians to have a better education that includes this level of training. I've also worked through the Institute of Functional Medicine with this and we have identified key dietitians out there in the country who are in influential positions, like authors of textbooks, researchers, clinicians... I do a lot of career counseling, nothing official, but people call and ask, \"What should I do with my career? How do I get where you are?\" We have so many dietitians in this country, how much healthier we could be if we could train those dietitians (1,500-2,000 in Michigan) to do the work their nutrition calling should be about. I want to see more people doing the work. I want to be able to refer to more colleagues. There need to be more of us doing this. KM: Anything else you want to say? CN: I feel like, for people, don't accept the limitations of what you might be told diagnosis-wise and prognosis-wise. I've had people come and they are so afraid of what they have been told, diagnosis-wise: \"I'm sorry there is nothing we can do for you.\" And never give up. Craig is an example of never give up. When you work for someone, you are working to get them further. So you have to find someone who is really going to work for you. You are hiring me. I'm not just this person to just give you a diet and supplements. [I want] For people to really be consumers of health care and not to give up. Do your homework, ask all the questions you need to. You need to trust the person and not be afraid to ask a lot of questions. Coco Newton is a registered dietitian and certified clinical nutritionist.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 64 (C\u00e9sar Valdez, 43, is a local psychotherapist doing cutting edge work with Sensorimotor Psychotherapy, EMDR, trauma and grief work, and with transpersonal approaches to personal development. Trained at U-M's School of Social Work, he's been practicing in Ann Arbor for 15 years. I sat down with Valdez a few months back to get a sense of what he's up to. Handsome, sincere, forthright, dedicated to his work, it's apparent that he is solidly grounded in his psychotherapy practice while at the same time ever evolving and fiercely open to new modalities and new psychodynamic and spiritual frontiers.) Bill Zirinsky: C\u00e9sar, you mentioned to me that at this point in your therapy practice, that you are \"using psychotherapy to get to the divine essence in all of us.\" You are a social worker and therapist, but your own spiritual journey has caused your practice to become more of a transpersonal one. That's intriguing, please tell us more. C\u00e9sar Valdez: Sure. It's really about uncovering untapped dimensions of ourselves that aid our healing and allow our fullest potential to emerge and flourish. Daniel Siegel, a neuroscience researcher, describes eight levels of neurobiological integration. They range from things like the integration of consciousness, to that of memory and of narrative. But he says that as we achieve new levels of integration across the eight domains, a ninth level emerges in which we begin to feel a different sense of connection to both ourselves and the world around us. This new identity goes beyond our previously skin-defined sense of self and toward an expanded awareness. He calls this expanded state, \"transpirational integration.\" These neuroscience findings affirm what I've learned in both my psychotherapy practice and in my spiritual exploration: that there is a wisdom and intelligence in each of us beyond that of our own mind. We might call this the Higher Self, the Essential Self, or our Divine Essence. Mindfulness-based therapies like EMDR and Sensorimotor Psychotherapy rely on this wisdom. I love using psychotherapy as a platform for cultivating a deeper relationship with that power and potential that lies beyond the limits of the personality. Not only does it have tremendous power to heal, but also to expand our sense of connection to a larger whole, beyond our personal lives, and beyond any sense of isolation we might perceive. In this state, our Essential Self emerges, thrives, and reveals its many gifts. Bill Zirinsky: What is the nature of your spiritual practice? Do you have a particular spiritual teacher? Are there any books about your specific practice that you could recommend to our readers? C\u00e9sar Valdez: Seven years ago, I began studying with a spiritual teacher, Atum O'Kane, who brought his two-year foundation course to Ann Arbor. At the time, I had done quite a bit of work in psychotherapy but no spiritual exploration. The field of psychology has traditionally kept its distance from spirituality, so while I found my own work in therapy deeply beneficial and transformative, I felt a pull to explore other dimensions of the world and of myself. Atum's work combines Jungian psychology with Sufism, Christian Mysticism, Judaism, and other wisdom traditions. His courses offer ways to explore spirituality and psychology, not so much through theory as through deeply lived experience. Here, I began exploring such things as prayer as a state of being, discerning the call of the soul, developing an intentional God image. His teachings have greatly influenced my life and affirmed and enhanced my practice of psychotherapy. Bill Zirinsky: You have a lot of experience in trauma work with clients. Tell us what trauma work has taught you. C\u00e9sar Valdez: Borrowing again from Atum's teachings on the essential archetypes of spiritual guidance, my journey as a psychotherapist has taught me how to hold a sacred space for sharing; to listen for the cries from deep within; to offer seeds of wisdom; to advocate for and affirm the emergence of the Essential Self; to guide others through many dimensions of an inner journey; and to celebrate the joy of liberation through transformation and healing. I learned to recognize these aspects of relational healing from him, as he was the one to put them into words and teach me to consciously engage them, but it was all my years as a trauma therapist that taught me how to really live out these principles in real, healing relationships. As my years of working primarily with trauma come to completion, I'm deeply grateful for the ways it has prepared me for what I'm now exploring in my practice. Bill Zirinsky: \"Listening for the cries from deep within.\" Please say more.C\u00e9sar Valdez: All of us in helping professions are listening for the cries of our clients. This is just one of the archetypes of spiritual/psychological guidance. The excitement lies in developing enough attunement to hear not only what's being reported but also the deeper cries of disowned parts not speaking in words. All good, effective psychotherapy is, in some way, concerned with deep listening. Often, the soul is crying out, needing healing, or longing for expression. But in today's world, many of us are anesthetized to our inner life. There are also, of course, the exuberant cries of joy and healing! BZ: How is the trauma work different from your current transpersonal emphasis?Valdez: Both are beautiful, deep, and meaningful work. Each has the same essence and ingredients for healing. But trauma work comes first. If parts of the personality remain stuck in survival mode, then those parts can't relax enough to achieve higher states of expanded awareness. Clients with extensive trauma histories need first to establish a somatic sense of safety. BZ: You're working with Induced After Death Communication (IADC), developed by Al Botkin, which you told me is derived from EMDR. Please tell us about it. Valdez: You know that deep sense of comfort that comes when we have a felt sense of a deceased loved one's presence? This is at the heart of IADC therapy. Many EMDR therapists have witnessed clients spontaneously perceive the presence of a deceased loved one during grief-focused therapy sessions. In fact, last fall I presented at the EMDR International Association conference in Denver, and well over half of the more than 250 participants said that their clients had had this experience during therapy without intentionally trying for it. Back in the 90's, Al Botkin, while working at the VA hospital in Chicago, had six clients who experienced this within a discrete three-week period. He went back and studied his notes to find out what alterations he was making to EMDR that might account for this phenomenon. He eventually developed his own protocol that can reliably induce, in most clients, the psychological state in which a sense of presence of a deceased person occurs, usually through one or more of the five senses. My interest in this work is actually not the perception of communication with the deceased; rather, what I love about it is its capacity to dramatically transform feelings of loss and separation and to move one into expanded awareness. I'm now training other EMDR therapists in the method. BZ: Who is Irene Siegel and how does she fit into this? An Interview with Psychotherapist C\u00e9sar Valdez \u2014 Listening for the Cries from Deep Within I n t e r v i e w b y B i l l Z i r i n s k y Photography by Joni Strickfaden All good, effective psychotherapy is, in some way, concerned with deep listening. Often, the soul is crying out, needing healing, or longing for expression. But in today's world, many of us are anesthetized to our inner life. There are also, of course, the exuberant cries of joy and healing! These neuroscience findings affirm what I've learned in both my psychotherapy practice and in my spiritual exploration: that there is a wisdom and intelligence in each of us beyond that of our own mind. We might call this the Higher Self, the Essential Self, or our Divine Essence. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 65 Valdez: I've been following Irene Siegel's work for a few years, and I had the opportunity to hear her speak at the EMDRIA conference in September. She is also using EMDR as a path to expanded awareness. Her work involves using health issues as a doorway into healing psychological wounds. I've been integrating more of this into my practice, which has been very gratifying. By strategically tuning in and reaching an expanded state of consciousness, clients are able to identify the function of illnesses, and they often link to specific wounds from their past. As they heal emotionally and psychologically, their health issues often improve, quite dramatically in some cases. BZ: What is the mission of Partners in Healing, and who are your partners in that? Valdez: Carrie Hatcher-Kay, Sharon Gold-Steinberg, and I offer training opportunities to other psychotherapists. Our work blends teachings from the field of interpersonal neurobiology with more traditional modalities. We have great fun collaborating together, and I'm very fortunate to work with partners I respect and admire so much. BZ: Where were you raised, C\u00e9sar? You mentioned to me that you grew up in a family that was not curious about people's inner world. How did you come to be a therapist? Valdez: I grew up in Texas in a border town along the Rio Grande. As in many Mexican-American families, the world of psychotherapy was nonexistent, but I was always desperately curious about my own and others' inner lives, about relationships and dynamics. When I got to college, I began taking psychology and English courses. They offered opportunities to begin exploring this part of me that had been yearning for expression and longing to unfold. It was as though these atrophied muscles were finally strengthening. When I later discovered the world of psychotherapy, I immediately felt at home in it. This vital part of me had finally found a place to be in the world, and to be productive and creative within it. On a deep soul level, I identify as a facilitator of healing. Our current society happens to offer that opportunity in the form of psychotherapy, but even if I'd been around long before the advent of psychology, I'm sure I'd have been in some kind of healing profession. BZ: You worked at Maxey Boys Training School. What was that like, and what was its gift for you, in the development of your therapeutic skills? Valdez: This was my first internship in social work, and it was baptism by fire, but in a good way. It was my first introduction to the deleterious effects of trauma and to trauma treatment. It was also my first introduction to EMDR. Some of the staff had recently trained in EMDR, and I got to watch demonstrations with other volunteer staff. In retrospect, I'm so grateful to have witnessed the power of that kind of tuning in, at the core of EMDR, so early in my career. It obviously left an imprint because it's still at the heart of what I do today. BZ: Later you worked at a foster care agency in Detroit. You were exposed there to a significant level of disturbance within families. Specifically, what kind of work did you do there? Did you like it? What did that work mean for you? Valdez: Upon graduating, I ended up working at Evergreen Children's Services as a therapist for foster kids. There, I learned about the importance of stabilization prior to any kind of trauma processing. For these kids, this not only meant a stable placement but also helping them to regulate their understandable and sometimes difficult behavioral problems. By the time I left, I'd become quite confident and good at setting firm but compassionate behavioral limits\u2014a skill that would be greatly tested upon having my own children! Mostly, however, I learned about resilience. It is popular to speak of resilience when one wants to sound like a good social worker, but I truly witnessed people's enormous capacity to face extraordinary challenges, carry on, and heal. Throughout my career, that experience has given me deep and abiding faith in my clients' abilities, and the confidence to greatly challenge them into more deeply healing work. BZ: Please briefly describe Sensorimotor Psychotherapy?Valdez: SP is a somatic psychotherapy that addresses trauma and developmental issues at the level of the body. Through SP interventions, I look at how body structure and movements participate in psychological, emotional, and relational experiences, and how the body can act as a primary vehicle for transformation and healing. I've completed Levels 1 and 2 of intensive training offered by the SP Institute and integrate it into all my work\u2014at the level of intervention with many clients, and at the level of conceptualization with all clients. BZ: Please share with us a few anecdotes from your work which illustrate the authenticity and power of the kind of experiential modalities you work with. Valdez: Okay. Let me give you some examples which are composites, not actual clients. While it's impossible to capture such complexity in a few sentences, these might give an idea of the kinds of experiences my clients might have in a session.One example of a body-oriented intervention involves a man who, as a child, sought refuge in his closet from his physically abusive father. His body still held the frozenness\u2014the attempt to achieve invisibility\u2014that kept him safe in that closet, yet it had also become a way of life, affecting all his relationships and ability to move forward with goals. But a tiny movement in his legs bespoke an impulse to flee. Mindfully, we followed the guidance of his legs as they moved him toward the door and out into the hallway. He returned smiling and reported, \"I thought I'd never stop, but as soon as I turned the corner, I was done, like my legs had just been waiting to tell me that this is all they needed to do.\" Resolving the frozenness led to steady changes in his everyday experience and relationships.An IADC client lost his wife to cancer. He sobbed heavily as we processed his deep sadness. A peaceful calm followed. Tuning in to his expanding peacefulness, a gentle smile emerged. He perceived a warm embrace from his wife and heard her voice reassuring him of her ongoing presence in his life. He left having deeply integrated a sense of loving connection with his wife, transforming his grief.A woman presented with colitis. As a holistic thinker, she sensed there might be an underlying emotional problem affecting her medical issues. Using EMDR, she tuned into her illness and allowed information to arise in the form of body sensations, images, feelings, and eventually a corresponding memory. After processing the memory to resolution, we took the emerging positive beliefs and sense of connection to a greater cosmic whole and intentionally fortified her body with this flow of compassion and well-being. After several sessions with this kind of focus, her symptoms largely alleviated. BZ: Is your practice people of all ages, individuals or families? You've told me that you love practicing psychotherapy. Please talk about the gift of it, for you. Valdez: These days I only work with individual adults. How do I explain the gift of practicing psychotherapy? Consider the repeated experience of meditatively attuning to another in the resonant field of lovingkindness. I never imagined all the doors of the heart and mind it would open for me. BZ: In addition to your association with Partners in Healing, have you done other work training psychotherapy professionals?Valdez: I taught for three years at a psychotherapy training institute at the University of Michigan. I still enjoy offering consultation and supervision to therapists through my private practice. BZ: Tell us briefly about your family. And do you live in Ann Arbor?Valdez: I live in Ann Arbor with my wife and three kids. Thinking of them makes me smile. BZ: What do you love about Ann Arbor in the spring?Valdez: I love the return of color after months of gray skies and white earth. While that has its own beauty and serenity, it's always so joyful to watch the world exuberantly burst back into vivid Technicolor. And I love the return of people's faces and forms after being covered under so many layers\u2014a different kind of beautiful blooming. BZ: Thank you, C\u00e9sar.(Cesar Valdez, LMSW, is a Certified EMDR practitioner, a Level 2 graduate of the Sensorimotor Psychotherapy Institute, and a Certified Trainer of IADC Therapy.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 66 Renee Robbins was born in Elyria, Ohio, in 1943, a mere five years after her parents managed to escape from Vienna right before the Anschluss \u2014 Germany's annexation of Austria, on March 12, 1938. She has lived in Ann Arbor since 1969, and last fall she traveled to Vienna. It was her first time visiting the city where her parents met and married. Months before the trip, she said, \"I've never wanted to go, and I have to get myself over that hump of thinking that it's a dark, evil place.\" \"I have been to Europe before. We actually lived in Germany one summer 25, 26 years ago. John (her husband) had a job at the University of Konstanz. We were there for the entire summer. We hiked in the Austrian Alps, it never occurred to me to go to Vienna,\" Robbins said with wonder in her voice. \"It just never occurred to me. My parents made sure that I would never want to go back.\" They did that by, among other things, never speaking German at home, and so Robbins grew up not learning her parents' mother tongue. Her parents, now deceased, never returned to Vienna and managed to convey to her their bitter memories and feelings about their homeland. \"I pictured it as dark gray in my mind. I had an aunt and uncle, now long gone (who escaped from Vienna around the same time as Robbins' parents), and they used to go back. In their car they had a tape of German folk songs and I thought they were awful.\" Robbins makes a gagging gesture as she says this. \"How could they be listening to this stuff? They didn't have those feelings, but my parents did.\" And yet, despite the strong anti-German sentiment in her childhood home, as an adult, in 1987, Robbins and her husband hosted a 15-year-old German exchange student, Urs Ruth, in their home. \"My father was still alive,\" said Robbins. \"And he did have something to say about that! 'Why a German?' In spite of his first reactions, my father was always open to having his mind changed. Urs was so attentive to him, so engaged with him, that my father had to change his mind! We became very, very close. Urs came back and stayed with us again. I went to his wedding; we've been at his parents' house. I mean he's like a son. Urs moved his whole family here four years ago and they lived here for two and a half years. I taught his older son piano,\" said Robbins, who has been a piano teacher for most of her adult life. In fact, Robbins' trip to Vienna was partly sparked by Urs' desire for his American \"exchange parents\" to come and see his house in Germany. This time, Robbins decided she would also visit Vienna. \"I thought, It's only going to get harder to go there.\" In late August and early September of last year, she and her husband spent three weeks in Europe, mostly visiting Urs, their \"exchange son,\" and other friends, and hiking in the Austrian Alps. But they also spent a week in Vienna. \"As we were getting to Vienna on the train I could feel my blood pressure go up. I could feel this rush of adrenaline. I felt myself get really nervous.\" They stayed in Leopoldstadt, Vienna's 2 nd district, situated on an island between the Donaukanal (the Danube Canal) and the Danube River. Leopoldstadt is also known as Matzo Island because for centuries it was, and still is, the Jewish section of the city. \"Our first morning there John said, 'Why don't we go to your parents' apartment?' So we walked over there, I took pictures. I wished I could have called my parents up and said, 'Guess where I am!' My father would have said, 'Why would you want to be there?' He would have said something derogatory. Then we went to where my father had his medical practice. In the States he became a pathologist, but in Vienna he was a doctor, he had a practice, he was a GP . In the late 1930s, the Jewish doctors were no longer considered doctors and they weren't allowed to treat anyone who wasn't Jewish.\" Robbins has a niece, Sum Mee Chomet, who is an actor. \"She was very close to my dad, and she received a commission, a grant from the Minneapolis Jewish Arts Organization, to write a play about him. Six or seven years ago, she used that money to go to Vienna and do research.\" Chomet was able to put Robbins in touch with Michaela Raggam-Blesch, a historian in Vienna who, though not herself Jewish, specializes in Jewish topography, before, during, and after the war. Raggam-Blesch was able to help Robbins visualize a little of her parents' surroundings and lives before they left: \"Every place I'd ask about she'd say, 'Here's the story of this.'\" When Robbins told her where they were staying, Raggam-Blesch said: \"Two doors down from you is a community mikveh, a bathhouse. It's not being used now. We're trying to claim that it's a historical site and it can't be used for anything else.\" In Vienna, as well as in some cities in Germany, there has been an effort to remember the Nazi's victims. Throughout the city, and especially in Leopoldstadt, there are now bronze plaques embedded in the sidewalks, and each one says \"These people were deported and killed.\" \"Each plaque has a person's name and birth date, and when they were killed and where. Every single one I passed I felt I had to take a picture. It was like, how can you pass these and not take a picture. It's bearing witness. That's all I can do, take a picture,\" Robbins remembered. There were about 180,000 Jews living in Vienna before the war, nearly 10 percent of the population of the city. Half of those Jews, including Robbins' parents, as well as famous residents like Sigmund Freud, managed to get out in 1938. After the war, there were 5,000 Jews left in Vienna. \"That leaves 85,000...\" Robbins' voice trails off. \"I have this stack of letters from my father's family, sent in 1937, 1938 to relatives here in the U.S., begging them \u2014 it's really heartbreaking \u2014 saying 'we won't be a burden on you, we're willing to work hard, get us out.'\" Robbins' family in Vienna was among the lucky ones. Besides her parents, nearly all her relatives were able to leave. She explained: My father's parents got out, my mother's mother, my uncles and aunts, they all came over at the same time as my parents. My mother's father was Hungarian; he couldn't get in here because the quota was filled for Hungarians. His wife, my grandmother, was Bulgarian, and so she got here, but he didn't. He was sent to Conscious Travel Renee Robbins Returns to the Vienna Her Parents Escaped in 1938 By Sandor Slomovits Renee Robbins She has lived in Ann Arbor since 1969, and last fall she traveled to Vienna.

And my mother's brother actually was in Dachau, but he was there not as a Jew but as a political prisoner, and so his treatment while not good, wasn't as bad. He survived and came to this country, where he was promptly drafted and had to go back to Germany in the U.S. Army! Robbins and her husband spent several hours in the Israelitische Kultusgemeinde Wien, the Jewish Archive in Vienna. It was there that, with the help of archivist Irma Wulz, Robbins made her most surprising discoveries. \"There is more of a story than I thought there would be. My main stunning realization is that I have a history in Vienna; my grandparents didn't fall from the sky, as I had suspected.\" Robbins continued: I always thought my grandparents were first generation Viennese; that they came from the east, Hungary, Bulgaria, what's now the Ukraine. And that's mainly true, but it's not completely true, because I have family that goes way back in Vienna, at least great-great-grandparents, and I never knew that. That's as far back as they can trace, because the Jewish community incorporated in 1826 and before that they don't really have records. I saw my father's and my mother's birth certificates \u2014 right there on a computer in Vienna! My parents were born in Vienna, but my grandparents, on my father's side, were born in the Ukraine. The amazing part is on my mother's side. They could trace that back and back and back and they could tell me where people were buried in the central cemetery of Vienna, the exact graves. I had no idea that I actually have roots in Vienna. It changed my feeling about this city. Irma Wulz at the Archive told them: \"I can tell you exactly the grave numbers, but you're never going to find them. You need somebody to help you.\" \"Sum Lee, my niece, had told me before we left, 'It's really disgraceful how weedy the Jewish part of the cemetery is, compared to the Christian part.' And she was right,\" Robbins said. \"It was the most heartbreaking thing. The person who took us around was an ultra Orthodox, he was from Brooklyn, but he lives in Vienna and works for the Rabbi. I asked him why the cemetery was so neglected and he said, 'Oh, it's because the Christians, after a certain amount of time if nobody claims the grave, they take the gravestone out, so that part of the cemetery is very clean, but the Jews never take graves out and it's very hard to clean between graves.' That's what he said. True? I don't know.\" \"He found my great-grandmother and great-grandfather in the same grave,\" Robbins continued. \"They died about six months apart in 1901. That gravestone was really covered in ivy and other weeds and he and John and I pulled the ivy off. After we cleaned it off, it was still very hard to read, so he asked, 'Do you want me to go to my car and get my shaving cream?' And I thought, shaving cream? Really? He came back, sprayed shaving cream all over the tombstone and we wiped it off and there the whole thing was. Wow. He said that shaving cream is great because the next rain will wash it off. We found other graves that were covered in waist high nettles. European nettles don't look the same as the American variety, but they feel the same.\" On Friday night Robbins went to Shabbat services at a progressive synagogue, Saturday morning to a Sephardic service, in honor of her maternal grandmother who had been married in a Sephardic wedding. And she and her husband did some of the same things many tourists do in Vienna. They went to the Freud Museum, heard the Mozart Requiem in a beautiful church, planned to see the Klimt exhibit at the Modern Art Museum but got lost on the way and instead found a good music store. And even as they did the usual touristy things, the past did not release its grip. One night they went to see Tosca at the famed Vienna State Opera, the Staatsoper. While there, Robbins remembered her mother telling her that when she and Robbins' father lived in Vienna, they used to buy standing-room-only tickets to the opera. \"They would bring their lunch, they would bring fish sandwiches, and everybody would move off,\" she said, laughing. \"There's a lot we didn't see. All the sights you're supposed to see in Vienna, people have been asking me, 'Did you go to this place? Did you go to that place?' No, no, no. It felt like a mission, I felt like I was on a mission. This trip has been intense, to say the least!\" she said. \"I had no idea I had a history there. I thought it was one generation passing through, and it wasn't \u2014 completely. So my family was part of this city. They were there. I had the feeling in some ways that I belonged there. I would go back. I don't know if I will. I don't know what will happen, but I would go back. I'd like to go to the Stadttemple (the only one of nearly a hundred synagogues to survive Kristallnacht and the war) next time. I didn't see it!\" \"Somebody said the hardest thing was not that they were invaded but that it was their neighbors, people they thought were their friends. I've thought about this for years, I've wondered, what would I do? If there were some people being massacred around me, and I knew that my life was in danger (if I helped them) what would I do? Am I brave enough to stand up for them? I don't know.\" They went to the Freud Museum, heard the Mozart Requiem in a beautiful church, planned to see the Klimt exhibit at the Modern Art Museum but got lost on the way and instead found a good music store.

I wished I could have called my parents up and said, 'Guess where I am!'\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 68 Three years ago, Laura Robinson moved to Scio Township with her husband and two children. For five years before the move, they lived on Berkshire Road, within walking distance of central campus in Ann Arbor. But they wanted a more rural setting. They chose the township for its tranquility, a quality that attracts many township residents. Two years after their move, West Bay Exploration came looking for oil. Robinson learned about the company's presence \u2014 and about the dangers of the oil industry's incursions \u2014 from her neighbors, who were suddenly talking about leasing agents (\"landmen\") who were going door to door inviting property owners to lease their mineral rights. Many signers were unaware of the health and environmental damages that might ensue, along with collateral damage prospects, including unsightly oil rigs and busy, noisy, truck traffic. Many residents felt pressured or seduced into signing the leases peddled by these salesmen. In April 2014, Robinson attended a meeting that featured talks by oil company executives. She listened in amazement, disturbed by their confidence. They seemed certain that residents would be happy to have them in the township once they understood the benefits, both personal and communal. For Robinson, it was clear that things were moving in the wrong direction. The community, she said, has a nature ethos; it is \"preservation minded.\" Residents bike, hike, and enjoy the area's serenity. She sensed that the West Bay people figured folks \"might squawk,\" as she put it, but then they'd lie down and the oil company would move in. \"The oil industry has incredible power,\" said Robinson. For her, creating a platform to advocate for community rights to regulate oil and gas development, especially as it affects neighborhoods, water resources, and preserved open-space, was \"a moral imperative.\" Within weeks, Robinson had an entourage of concerned citizens. Barely a month after that April meeting, she founded \"Citizens for Oil-Free Backyards,\" or COFBY . \"I grabbed a few people around me, and off we went,\" she said. \"It was quite a journey.\" The group was bound together by a feeling of profound injustice and they were determined not to be victims of the greedy oil industry. Their immediate goal was to keep West Bay from drilling the very first well in Scio Township. To have West Bay invade the peaceful idyll of township residents seemed outrageously unfair. Robinson and her neighbors soon learned that state law gave townships little if any control over oil companies; they were powerless to keep oil wells away from homes. West Bay might just go in and do what they wanted because the township, like any township, had no say whatsoever about it. The only things that townships could regulate were the ancillary aspects of the oil well. Robinson consulted with elected officials, legal professionals, and environmental experts, and got a crash course in government, politics, the oil industry, community organizing, and diplomacy. Looking back, she says \"it was very hard.\" Fortunately, she had the support of her husband, who \"stepped in and did everything at home,\" she said. Still, she worried about her kids. She was reassured when she saw how avidly they participated in a community picket of the well site. They also wrote encouraging notes. One said: \"Great job, mom!\" Her maternal concerns were further tempered by her conviction that working for this cause and protecting her family's environment was a good lesson for her children. She wanted them to understand that \"sometimes there are bigger things in the world that people need to take care of.\" She added: \"It's important for kids to have role models. They need to learn to stand up for themselves, to do what's right, to take on injustices.\" Her kids were already careful recyclers and aware of environmental concerns. She recalled her kids' response to the BP oil spill in the Gulf in 2010. On their own initiative, they set up a lemonade stand on the sidewalk and raised money to help the animals harmed by the spill. \"They feel knowledgeable,\" Robinson said. \"That is hopeful.\" Even before having a title, Robinson took COFBY's leadership role. Once the organization received nonprofit status, the board elected her president. The group relied on social media, press releases, and mass emails to report its findings and activities and to announce upcoming meetings. They held potlucks and town hall meetings. They gathered for rallies and met with local, county, and state officials. Even though Robinson was still working part-time, she threw herself, full-throttle, into the effort. COFBY began fundraising. They hired an environmental consultant, Christopher Grobbel, and an attorney, Arthur Siegal, who spoke compellingly Too Close for Comfort ~ Citizens for Oil-Free Backyards By Rachel Urist Photography by Susan Ayer \"...it's unacceptable that township communities suffer the disastrous consequences of having their natural resources exploited and their natural areas destroyed so that a private company can try to extract a small amount of oil.\" -Laura RobinsonSeated: Ian Hoffman, Secretary; Russ Taichmann (not pictured: Rob French, Donna Vigilant, and Kathleen Knol.)The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 69 to a packed town hall last spring. With their guidance and Robinson's leadership, the group devised a plan. First they launched an all-out organizational effort to teach citizens of Scio Township about the liabilities of oil drilling near their homes. Ann Arborites should note that oil drilling in the upstream township threatens city dwellers, too. Eighty-five percent of the city's water supply comes from the Huron River, whose waters could be compromised, as could the soil and water tables of surrounding areas. COFBY's frequent press releases were clear and informative, and each contained the organization's mission statement. That statement, always presented in bullet points, evolved as the group grew in knowledge and experience. The mission statement currently reads: \u00b7 To educate and inform state residents, local units of government, and state legislators about oil and gas exploration and development; \u00b7 To educate citizens about state policy, and to inform state policy in the direction of giving all local communities the right to manage oil and gas exploration and development in ways consistent with local goals \u2014 whether those be for residential, open-space preservation, outdoor recreation and sport, or other development \u2014 and with maintaining the integrity of drinking and surface water; \u00b7 To ensure that the oil and gas industry and the state agency that regulates it protect state residents and their communities as well as the rights of local units of government. While we do not advocate for specific future alternatives, we believe that the finite supply of fossil fuels will eventually lead toward sustainable energy policies. Meanwhile, we seek practical, intelligent solutions that will benefit local units of government and state residents at the current time. Saline and Lodi already had wells. New drilling had been approved, and drilling was now on the horizon for Scio Township. In June 2014, COFBY filed a motion for a temporary restraining order against West Bay Exploration. The motion was dismissed by Washtenaw County Circuit Court Judge David Swartz and sent to Lansing. Robinson met with town council representatives, with State Representatives Gretchen Driskell (D-Saline) and Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor), and with State Senator Rebekah Warren. Initially, the Scio Township Board of Trustees thought there was nothing they could do. Robinson and her COFBY colleagues, who did extensive research, provided information and persuaded them otherwise. Robinson summarized COFBY's approach as follows: We'd learned enough to know that the township could implement ordinances about noise, truck traffic, and the infrastructure, if not the drilling. We reached out to the township board members on a regular basis. We educated them. We were forceful. We gathered the community to come to meetings and put pressure on them. We did not let up on that pressure for one minute. In August, the Scio Township board passed a moratorium on oil and gas activity. Nevertheless, on August 19, West Bay began drilling at the corner of West Delhi and Miller Roads. On September 3, the company announced that the 5,000-foot exploratory well was dry and would be plugged. Robinson was relieved but guarded in her optimism. Though the Scio Township well was dry and activity wrapped, many residents worry that the oil companies may return. Asked about the risk, Robinson said: A report of a dry well doesn't mean there's not oil right down the street. An exploratory well is just that, and typically they just continue exploring nearby. The difference in this case is that there was state-level attention being paid to this well and additional exploration would have caused more uproar. The leases I've seen are for five years and can be renewed. They could come back any time within those five years. They may be waiting to see what happens. They could decide this was too much and they won't come back. They said they encountered more citizen resistance than they expected. Or it could be years, months. The threat is there. In Scio, West Bay drilled near the Huron River. \"We really have reached a tipping point. People are saying we have had enough of oil and gas coming into our neighborhoods...\" -Laura Robinson Many residents felt pressured or seduced into signing the leases peddled by these salesmen. Continued on page 70The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 70 She added: \"I think it's really crucial that people keep their guard up, that we keep working on this and remain vigilant. We don't want the pressure we've applied to go away and then for them or another company to come back and try again.\" In August, West Bay began drilling a well in a residential neighborhood in Shelby Township, in Macomb County. Shelby residents turned to Robinson for help. COFBY visited the well, notified the press and elected officials, and issued a press release that included the following: Citizens for Oil-Free Backyards visited the Shelby well during daylight and nighttime hours with upset residents of the local community. We experienced extremely bright lights; loud noise comparable to a freeway, along with squealing sounds, despite a muffler reportedly being installed, as it would be in Scio; and vibration. The press release included Robinson's impassioned response: This invasion of residential areas by oil and gas companies is exactly what the residents of Michigan should not have to tolerate. This well has ruined a community, and the same type of wells will ruin Scio Township, where many homes are just as close as those in Shelby and where there are numerous natural areas. An exploratory well is just the beginning of the process \u2014 when oil is found, it is followed by development such as additional wells, tank batteries, compressor stations, central processing facilities, pipelines, and constant truck traffic. It's unacceptable that the rights of citizens to enjoy their lives in their established neighborhoods and to maintain their property values are made secondary, or even less, to the interests of oil and gas companies that suddenly come along and purchase the rights to minerals under the ground. It's unacceptable that the health, safety, and well-being of Michigan residents and the well-being of the environment are sacrificed. And it's unacceptable that township communities suffer the disastrous consequences of having their natural resources exploited and their natural areas destroyed so that a private company can try to extract a small amount of oil. This is not an investment in communities but a destruction of them.When Robinson and her COFBY colleagues began this campaign, they explored the history of the oil companies. She admits that during the spring and summer of 2014, taking on this powerful industry was daunting \u2014 even though she felt very confident in herself, her organization, and her mission. She quotes Pema Chodron, a Buddhist nun, who said: \"Bravery is not fearlessness; it's feeling fear and taking action anyway.\" Robinson and her colleagues took measures to protect their privacy. Among the Scio Township residents who threw their support to COFBY is Josh Pokempner, a creative entrepreneur, philanthropist, and self-described \"recovering architect.\" He had this to say about her: Laura Robinson is an amazing person \u2014 smart and fearless. She put herself at great risk taking on a big oil company. It's a big adversary; they can be a nuisance. With all their money, they can scare you away. They'd scare me away. I don't see anybody as bold as that in my world. Most of the people I know, including risk-takers, would think twice before taking on such a powerful company. They'd look at what the personal reward is and weigh the risk against the reward. For her, the personal reward is the community reward. She's doing it for all of us. She's skillful, organized, and powerful. It's inspiring. Rep. Jeff Irwin is also impressed. He said: She's a strong advocate. Her work ballooned to the point where we're now talking about what can be done statewide to change the laws to back before 2011, when Gov. Snyder changed the rules and took away local control. Restoring that control is the real challenge. I give her total credit for getting this issue on the radar at the state level. The hardest part of democracy is the community organizing that Laura's doing: getting out there, the hard slog of talking to neighbors, organizing community events, forums. During his campaign, Gov. Snyder was asked whether he thought local government should have the authority to regulate oil and gas. Basically, he said, 'Gosh, yeah, that's something we need to work on.' His answer indicated that (1) he may not have understood the law he signed, despite his law degree, and (2) Laura was getting to the governor's ear. This attests to the work she was doing, getting citizens up to speed. The governor was backpedaling on policies he had signed on! Too Close for Comfort Continued from page 69 Their immediate goal was to keep West Bay from drilling the very first well in Scio Township. To have West Bay invade the peaceful idyll of township residents seemed outrageously unfair. \"We'd learned enough to know that the township could implement ordinances about noise, truck traffic, and the infrastructure, if not the drilling.\" -Laura RobinsonPictured: Judith Hoffman, Laura Robinson, and Ian MoyerThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 71 Curious about how she became this fearless leader, I asked Robinson about her background. I was fully aware that she does not share much with outsiders. It occurred to me that she might preface her words with: \"This is off the record.\" But she was willing to share the following. She was born and raised in north-central North Carolina, in the town of Henderson, in Vance County. She has a twin brother. She spoke of her \"typical, idealized, 70's Southern childhood \u2014 playing outside with friends, watching TV sitcoms after school, spending the summers at the local pool.\" As a child, she loved being in a small town, where everyone seemed to know everyone else. It felt friendly. But her parents divorced when she was nine, which forced a move from the privileged side of town to the other side. The experience, she said, taught her \"about injustice, struggle, generosity, and strength.\" She spent her last two years of high school at the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics in Durham, the country's first public residential high school for gifted students. In her day, the student body numbered 200. Despite the size, it had the highest number of National Merit Scholars in the country. She was one. \"It's a very unique place; it was creative and intellectually stimulating. I wouldn't be who I am today without having gone there.\" Being public, the school was free to the limited number of students who were accepted. To help defer costs, the school gave s tudents work assignments. They worked either on the grounds crew or in the cafeteria. When CNN did a documentary on the school, the camera caught Robinson mopping the cafeteria floor. She then worked her way through Duke University, where she earned her B.A. in English. After graduating, she went to Washington, DC, and worked as an editor at Congressional Quarterly Books. She was enjoying the relatively privileged life of a young, working professional. But her route to work each day involved passing homeless people. She felt a sore \"disconnect\" between her life and theirs. She wanted to do something that mattered on a deeper level, to make a difference to people one-on-one. She decided to explore psychology, sensing a connection between her interest in the narratives and motivations of fictional characters and the real-world problems of flesh-and-blood people. Beyond that, she had \"no clue\" as to what psychology was about. She had never taken a psychology class. She returned to North Carolina, walked into the Psych Department at UNC-Chapel Hill, and looked for students and professors who might help. She found them, they were welcoming, and she ended up working as a research assistant at UNC and at Duke. While also freelancing as a book editor for several university and other presses, on topics ranging from literary theory to social history to analysis of fairy tales to sailing memoirs, she took psychology classes in order to be able to apply to graduate school. Today she holds a doctoral degree (a Psy.D.) in clinical psychology from the Graduate School of Applied and Professional Psychology at Rutgers University. Her dissertation explored two parallel dyads: mother as therapist and therapist as mother. She interviewed psychoanalytic therapists who were also mothers and examined analytic ideas on how the pairings overlap. Asked whether her professional training helped her in this recent undertaking, Robinson responded with an emphatic, threefold \"yes.\" Clinical training helped her to channel the chaos of the situation and fear and anger of the community into productive channels and to communicate effectively. The professional training also helped to keep those feelings under control. One could easily have felt completely overwhelmed. It also helped to know how to articulate thoughts and feelings in ways that could be heard by people with different perspectives and personalities. For Robinson, this was both helpful and gratifying. On a personal note, she added: As parents, we all think about our kids' future. There are so many destructive forces out there. You can feel powerless. I'd been thinking about 'what can I do' as a parent, as a psychologist. If you have a chance to make a difference, it feels you're doing something positive. We live with such denial \u2014 to protect ourselves from the overload of bad news: viruses, violence, terrorism at home and abroad \u2014 big forces at play. You want to provide hope. Robinson has become a symbol of what determined individuals can do. She hopes that COFBY's accomplishments will inspire others to organize and adopt activist approaches to oppose oil exploration near homes, waterways, and preserved spaces in their communities. \"We really have reached a tipping point,\" she said. \"It's a bipartisan issue. People are saying we have had enough of oil and gas coming into our neighborhoods and in sensitive natural areas, near wetlands, streams, coming close to people's front doors. It's just too much.\" \"The hardest part of democracy is the community organizing that Laura's doing: getting out there, the hard slog of talking to neighbors, organizing community events, forums.\" -Rep.

That phrase, \"comes as no surprise,\" was articulated by each of the friends contacted for this story. Kate Thomas-Palmer admires her friend for taking this on. She noted that Robinson has long been passionate about environmental and social justice issues, so it came as no surprise to see Robinson at the helm last summer. Retired Lieutenant Colonel Michael P . Murphy, U.S. Army, said it was no surprise to see her spearhead this effort to protect her community. \"Laura has always been actively civic minded. She pairs a sharp intellect with a passion to serve, resulting in a force of will that pushes her to act, and not just observe.\" When Laura phoned him to share her frustrations and the challenges of the undertaking, she knew that he, too, had encountered \"the machine,\" as he put it. \"We had some commonality of experience.\" She knew that next to the Leviathan of the alliance of Big Oil and government, she was a true underdog, yet her firm conviction that she was on the right side of morality and history compelled her to act. She was forced to confront those driven by money and votes, and not by what is best for family and community. Murphy understood her shellshock at being immersed in such an intense campaign. For Robinson, the intensity was unexpected and \"profound.\" Yet she knew she had to \"Drive On,\" as Murphy put it, in army vernacular. He said: I deeply respect Laura's fortitude and recognize it as something I learned to value as a combat veteran. When faced with what seems to be an insurmountable obstacle, one must become an unstoppable force. That is how I see Laura. Robinson emphasized that the oil industry gets its toehold by coming in with landmen who don't have to announce that they're there. They go to people's homes, get people to sign over mineral rights, and owners often sign without fully understanding the contract's import. COFBY has heard that people feel coerced, pressured, and that they're told that if everyone's signing, they should too. COFBY has tried to counteract that pressure by going door to door to explain who and what the landmen are. Word is that these agents' offers can be appealing because they talk about prospective profits from oil; they push the strike-it-rich approach; they offer bonuses for signing. It's tough trying to dissuade owners from leasing their mineral rights when they are feeling trapped or, alternatively, when they want to try to earn income. Robinson is well aware that sometimes people need the money. She asks: \"How can COFBY tell people that it's not okay for them to make money from their property?\" But citizens have learned to wonder whether they really do stand to make any money. Robinson underscored the following: 1) It 's rare to strike it rich, and there are many reports of people not getting fairly compensated. A case was recently settled in the state against Chesapeake Energy for this very reason. 2) P eople with the short-term goal of financial gain are giving up something important because of the long-term issues that can occur, not to mention the change they might be making to the ethos of their communities. 3) Pr operty values go down when there are oil and gas wells, and thus industrialization, all around you. 4) Mortg age issues can arise for those who lease. 5) Insur ance issues can also arise. 6) If c ontamination issues occur, it could be almost impossible to sell the property. Even without contamination, trying to sell a home when the mineral rights are leased might not be palatable to buyers. Leases are typically renewable at the discretion of the oil company, not the property owner. 7) The oil c ompanies' argument that oil drilling benefits communities is a divisive argument. It pits neighbor against neighbor when often those neighbors were getting along fine until the oil company came along. That's not a benefit to communities, nor does it benefit the communities when oil companies take the mineral resources from a community, turn the area into an oil field, and then leave. The oil industry has seen to its own interests, not to the interests of the citizens. Just because you have the right to do something doesn't mean it benefits your community. As a society and as a culture, people have evolved to work together in a way that helps everyone do better. Township residents don't want to see their communities divided between those who sign (the \"enemies\") and those who do not sign. 8) Ther e is a gross discrepancy between laws for citizens and laws for the oil and gas industry. Laws against noise violations for late-night parties, for instance, are enforced. Yet industries are permitted to put oil wells in residential neighborhoods and disturb the inhabitants' quality of life, health, safety, and welfare. 9) C OFBY has heard of many property owners who deeply regret signing. Some people sign without knowing both sides of the story, without consulting an attorney, and without understanding the long-term ramifications of their agreement. Once signed, a lease is legal and binding, and there is no real recourse to get out of it. It's hard to imagine any other situation where people sign away something as valuable as the rights to part of their property to a person they've never met who goes door-to-door. Robinson has explored the legal questions that arise when environmental issues disproportionally affect people who don't have the individual or communal resources to fight against them. This area of law, called \"environmental justice,\" also addresses the questions that arise when the oil industry comes into their neighborhoods or near their drinking water, and residents find themselves with no laws to protect them. In the case of people who want to lease their mineral rights because they want to make money and see it as their right to do so, Robinson sees a power imbalance in which the promise of financial gain for one is given precedence over the rights of others who own property nearby. Robinson and her colleagues were surprised to learn that the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) has not provided the safeguards necessary to protect people and the environment. It turns out that the mission of the MDEQ's Office of Oil, Gas, and Minerals, according to the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act (Part 615), is to facilitate extraction of oil and gas. This discovery was a shock. The agency's name suggests a different mission. As things stand, the MDEQ rarely withholds approval for oil company permits. (In 2014, 192 permit applications were received and 189 were approved.) In Scio Township, despite massive protests and unprecedented public outcries \u2014 with the support of state and local politicians, and despite the permit's two-month delay \u2014 the permit was still approved. Citizens must go to court and bear the costs in order to prevent Too Close for Comfort Continued from page 71 It's rare to strike it rich, and there are many reports of people not getting fairly compensated. As things stand, the MDEQ rarely withholds approval for oil company permits. (In 2014, 192 permit applications were received and 189 were approved.) \"I want my kids to grow up in a world where adults \u2014 parents \u2014 don't just hand off a damaged world to them, but think about the world they're handing over.\" -Laura RobinsonThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 73 drilling in their neighborhoods. COFBY also discovered that because of MDEQ's relatively few inspectors, there are situations around the state in which it takes days for the agency to respond to complaints. The failures of the MDEQ to clean up oil and gas contamination are documented in a 2001 Lake Michigan Federation report, compiled with the help of the Michigan Environmental Council. Listed among the more egregious examples of the agency's lax oversight are these: \u00b7 Some oil and gas pollution sites have been contaminated for as long as 35 years and have not yet been cleaned up. \u00b7 Not one contaminated groundwater site of those reviewed has been restored to health despite widely documented instances of oil and gas leaks contaminating some of the state's precious groundwater resources. The report notes that many of the sites reviewed still show chlorides or petroleum hydrocarbons contaminating private drinking water supplies. The pollution also degrades fish and wildlife habitats. The state knew about most of these polluted sites for an average of 13 years before taking action. Of the 36 sites reviewed, only two sites with relatively minor contamination have had complete cleanups and require no further action. Twenty-one sites still require further studies or actions, including plugging leaking wells. When people move into an area whose zoning category is \"rural-residential,\" they expect the area to remain protected. Though zoning categories are defined differently from one county to the next, the \"rural-residential\" designation is meant to preserve and retain the rural landscape and character of the region and to protect fragile environments. Yet West Bay Exploration went into a rural-residential area in Scio, as state law allowed. The well dug by the company last August, in Shelby Township, was in a nature preserve between densely populated residential subdivisions (at 25 Mile and Dequindre). In Scio, West Bay drilled near the Huron River. Oil wells can loom as close as 300 feet from private homes. According to Crain's Detroit Business , West Bay has drilled for oil in approximately 50 sites in Southeast Michigan, since 1986. According to the 1997 Annual Report for the State of the Great Lakes, over 50,000 wells have been drilled in Michigan since 1925. When oil companies begin prospecting, area residents are usually unpleasantly surprised by the appearance of drills and other industrial machinery, and discomfited, if not appalled, by the health and environmental risks as well as the noise and other quality of life issues. While all this is discouraging, it is heartening, Robinson said, to see the growing awareness among citizenry of the dangers and liabilities of oil drilling and of the problematic effect of state law on townships faced with oil exploration. Still, she is concerned about communities that have neither the academic and financial resources of her own township, nor the critical mass to fight back. This worry has prompted COFBY to go to other townships to help citizens organize. I asked one of Robinson's college friends about her. \"She's a spitfire,\" this friend said, before adding what had become the trademark elegy: \"I'm not at all surprised at what she's doing!\" When I asked Robinson whether she had political experience or a history of community organizing before founding COFBY , she chuckled. \"My experience was nil,\" she said. Aside from attending a presidential inauguration, working in a political context at Congressional Quarterly, obsessively following politics, and, in her younger years, participating in various protests and marches, her political activism had been through the ballot box, discussions with friends about different issues, and support of various causes. The only activist leadership role she recalled taking was two years ago, when she successfully mobilized her community to preserve the rural quality of their area by keeping certain dirt roads from being paved. But, she said, compared to launching COFBY , that dirt road venture was \"small-scale.\" It did, however, turn out to be helpful, because the experience made her a familiar face in Scio Township. It brought her name and face to the attention of the township board and to many area residents. Still, she said, \"I certainly had no idea life was going to bring me anything remotely like what it brought last summer! \" She is reflective about the summer's events. \"It was hard on the kids. They missed me,\" she said. \"I had a full life, and then I took this on.\" Does she have regrets? No. \"I want my kids to grow up in a world where adults \u2014 parents \u2014 don't just hand off a damaged world to them, but think about the world they're handing over.\" Robinson is glad that her kids learn in school about energy use as well as environmental concerns, critical elements of this oil issue. She hears her kids' concerns in their questions to her, including: \"What if there aren't any trees left when I'm your age?\" Robinson is convinced that this experience is teaching her children about courage, strength, and determination. They are also accustomed to their mom's busy schedule. She has continued to work as a psychologist and as the volunteer head of COFBY , and last December went to Lansing to testify about oil drilling before the lame-duck state Senate Committee on Natural Resources, Environment, and Great Lakes. The road is long, the work defined. She will not give up. For more information about COFBY, visit Oilfreebackyards.org.

Allergy & Skin Disease Advancing Age Problems Vomiting and/or Diarrhea Urinary Tract Infections Arthritis Functional medicine may be the key to restoring your pet's health. It combines science with alternative medicine to uncover the root causes of chronic disease.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 74 Spring has finally arrived, and along with it, another allergy season. Allergies and associated infections are common in pets. They are poorly understood and often difficult to treat. Allergies are an inappropriate activation of the immune system. Ideally, the immune system should react to infectious agents \u2014 not pollen, food, flea bites, and the many other things that can provoke an allergic response. A significant part of the difficulty in treating allergies results from the attempt to characterize allergic symptoms as diseases, such as atopy, food allergy, and so on. Functional medicine takes a more holistic approach, which leads to the evaluation of the whole patient. When the whole patient is examined, it becomes apparent that \"skin diseases,\" for example, often involve other body systems. A functional approach reveals the primary role played by food allergies in most patients. A dog typically breathes a few pounds of air in its life, whereas it eats hundreds of pounds of food. Because of this, 70 percent of the immune system is in the GI tract. In most allergic patients, food will be 70 percent of the problem. Resolving 70 percent of the problem often reduces the total allergy load to a point where the patient is no longer symptomatic.We see several common patterns in allergic pets. The \"simple\" cases are often straightforward. These animals typically have skin issues along with itching. Angel, a two-year-old German Shepherd, is an example of this type. She was very itchy, and conventional treatment had not helped. When a hypoallergenic diet, determined by blood test, was instituted, the itchiness resolved. Secondary yeast infections are a common problem associated with allergies. The infection can be obvious or occult. Brandy, an 11-year-old German Shepherd, had been treated extensively with steroids and antibiotics for chronic skin disease. Improvement did not occur until her occult (in the gut) yeast infection was treated by re-establishing balance in the GI tract. Allergies in dogs are most commonly associated with dermatological symptoms, but occasionally, other body systems are involved. Maya, a nine-year-old Shiba Inu mix, had begun wheezing. She was treated unsuccessfully for several months with various drugs. A hypoallergenic diet resolved the wheezing \u2014 and her corneal lipid deposits. Occasionally a patient will have unusual symptoms associated with a common condition. Allergies in most dogs usually involve itching and skin lesions on various areas of the body, but not every pet's symptoms are the same.

He had a two-inch circular area of complete hair loss and severe inflammation on his forehead. The lesion was bright red and was unresponsive to treatment with steroids. He did not have any other skin lesions, which is very unusual. Both the itching and the skin lesion responded well to a hypoallergenic diet. Hives are skin lesions also associated with allergies and hypersensitivity reactions. While they are most commonly caused by insect bites and vaccines, they can also be caused by reactions to food. Bailey, a 2-year-old Rhodesian Ridgeback, developed hives which responded well to steroids and antihistamines. However, when the medications were discontinued, the hives returned. Since there was no continuing exposure to vaccines or insects, it was determined that food allergies were likely the cause. Testing showed Bailey reacting to many foods. When these foods were eliminated from his diet, the hives resolved. In another case with unusual symptoms, the eyes were involved. Marley, a 4-year- old American Bull Terrier, had severe dermatitis involving all four feet, chronic ear infections, and keratitis sicca (dry eye). It was a very pleasant surprise when the dry eye, as well as her other symptoms, responded to dietary therapy. The idea that food is important to health is at least as old as Hippocrates and his maxim about food being medicine. Functional medicine has a deep appreciation of the complex interactions between food and the body. One of functional medicine's cardinal principles is to remove anything that may be contributing to a patient's illness. Removal could involve a pathogen, a toxin, or more commonly, food that is provoking an allergic response in the patient. If one considers food to be medicine, it is clear one can have adverse reactions to food just as to pharmaceutical agents.

Peachy Fitness, advertised as an \"Ann Arbor Yoga & Dance Studio for children, adults & families,\" offers classes for adults, but it is the sessions for children and families that clearly set it apart from the numerous other yoga studios in town. Passionate About Y oga Owner Zaini Lateef started Peachy Fitness to bring together two of her passions \u2014 yoga and a healthy lifestyle. Lateef started taking yoga classes after becoming a mom. She still remembers the \"amazing feeling\" after her first yoga class. Yoga has helped her with flexibility and weight issues. She wishes she had started it earlier, but she said, \"It is never too late to start.\" Lateef spoke of the many benefits yoga can provide kids, emphasizing it teaches them to be more peaceful. It also teaches them \"how to develop a bonding relationship with each other by doing partner poses either with their siblings, parents, or even a friend during a yoga class. Proper breathing, exercise, and deep relaxation help them stay more healthy and active.\"For two years Lateef organized yoga classes at various locations around Ann Arbor, and then, in June 2014, opened the permanent studio. The approximately 700-square foot studio (part of a 1,550-square foot space that includes event rooms) occupies the ground floor of an unassuming building next to the Ann Arbor fire station on S. Huron Parkway. Peachy Fitness takes advantage of its proximity to a nearby park for some outdoor activities. The location is convenient for their office neighbors who attend the lunchtime yoga class. Lateef said that the 45-minute class is popular, and she is looking into the possibility of taking lunchtime yoga to corporations for their employees. Appreciative Parents The parent/child classes provide a way for families to connect and share in physical and emotional bonding. Lateef said, as a mom herself, it is especially rewarding to see the benefits of family yoga. She offered the example of how parents are often busy taking their children to activities where they sit and wait for them, adding, \"With us, parents are in the studio doing activities with their kids.\" Cindy Templeman and her twin 7-year-old sons, Bobby and Costa, take the Family Yoga class together. She agreed that it is wonderful to have \"family time together\" with \"no electronics, no distractions, no errands to run.\" By Karen Foulke Larson How Peachy Fitness Introduces Family Y oga to Ann Arbor The parent/child classes provide a way for families to connect and share in physical and emotional bonding. Lateef's goal of providing yoga opportunities for children and classes that parents can take with their children seems to have answered a need. Y oga for All Ages ~ Zaini Lateef Photos by Susan AyerThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 79 Lateef's goal of providing yoga opportunities for children and classes that parents can take with their children seems to have answered a need. Templeman said she had been looking for family yoga for \"a long time,\" so she was very happy to find Peachy Fitness. The boys attended a summer yoga camp at Peachy Fitness and remembered lots of the poses for their Family Yoga class that started last September. Family Yoga classes can transform hectic Saturday mornings. Templeman's two active sons are \"melting like marshmallows\" and are in \"mummy poses,\" with their bodies completely still. Their teacher, Dominique Theophilus, also makes plenty of time for more active fun. Following a game with a hula-hoop, they do a trust circle and a game of yoga telephone (where the participants whisper the yoga pose around a circle). For the children's classes, the yoga studio becomes a place where yoga mats can transform into magic carpets for travel. Templeman's sons love the games, especially the obstacle courses made of yoga mats, stretching bands, and yoga blocks. High-energy games are followed by a quiet ending. Templeman's favorite part of the class is the last part, when each person gets a chance to say what they are grateful for. She said, \"I am always interested and surprised to hear what my boys, as well as the other kids, say.\" Grace Helms Kotre takes the Parents and Tots Yoga class with her daughters Noel (age 4) and Louise (age 2.5). She was thrilled to find the class because she had not found anything similar for parents with young children. Kotre is excited about introducing her girls to the practices of mindfulness and meditation. She said it is helpful to have those tools as early as possible to cope with the normal stresses of life.Kotre said that her daughters really look forward to going to class and do the poses and games at home. The girls also love their teacher, Theophilus. Kotre said that she is \"amazing\" and has a calm energy. She appreciates that Theophilus modifies things based on how the kids are responding. Theophilus said she comes to class with a set of things planned, but throughout the class she adjusts her plans based on what the kids want to do and their energy levels. She appreciates that children are so receptive. She said, \"We can learn from them. Their creative mind is endless, and yoga can bring that out.\" Lateef has assembled a talented group of ten instructors, many of whom were referred by other instructors, which is no surprise since, \"Yoga is about helping each other.\" Lateef pointed out that, as an independent studio, instructors can feel more freedom because it is not a franchise with corporate pressure. Lateef hopes the instructors \"feel like it is their own studio.\" Theophilus commented that Lateef has a passion and the studio has \"good energy.\" Kotre said you can tell that Lateef is \"passionate about sharing the practice of yoga.\" She appreciates that Lateef is so welcoming and genuine.

Zaini has really made us feel welcome and special. She is a wonderful person and obviously cares that all of the participants are happy and engaged.\" Maria Tikhonenko and her nine-year-old daughter, Anastasia, take the evening Candlelight Yoga class together. Tikhonenko was looking for a class for her daughter and was happy to find something they could both do. She said the instructors at Peachy Fitness are \"wonderful\" and she likes the small size. She said that having one studio allows you \"to focus on your class without distraction. When I used to take yoga classes in big gyms, there was always too much noise from the weightlifting room. The classes at Peachy Fitness are never crowded, so you get more attention from your instructor.\" For the Tikhonenkos, candlelight yoga has helped them \"learn how to relax at the end of a busy day.\" At the age of nine, Cha Chi Rodriguez realizes that \"yoga is a skill I can do my whole life.\" Her mom, Gwen Rodriguez, appreciates the \"discipline, focus, cooperation, and communication\" that her daughter learns through her Peachy Fitness classes. Rodriguez said her daughter is \"challenged and empowered\" at every class, and she \"always learns something.\" Y oga and More Summer camps in 2014 provided a way for kids to be introduced to yoga. With very little advertising, they had a good response, especially to the children's Art and Yoga class. Lateef expects camps to be even more successful in 2015. Other unique offerings have included a Namasplash event at Goldfish Swim School. Lateef said it was a \"huge success\" and the Rodriguez family agrees. Gwen Rodriguez said even toddlers took part in the stretching and yoga poses. \"It was a really fun evening.\" The summer running club transitioned to a family running club last fall. Basketball was originally offered as a summer camp, but now it is a weekly session.Continued from page 79 In addition to the studio space, there are \"party rooms\" for birthday parties or bachelorette parties and different options for yoga or Zumba parties. Peachy Fitness has hosted many special events, including a Halloween Yoga Party, a Black Friday event, a Crafts Party, and Kids Night Out. Lateef emphasizes the importance of giving back to the community, and the event she is most proud of was a fundraiser. Last year Peachy Fitness organized a Zumba fundraiser for a local family whose child had leukemia. Lateef is grateful to the instructors who donated their time and made the fundraiser possible. Growing Opportunities Lateef's son (12) and daughter (11) provided the motivation to create a business like Peachy Fitness, but they are also benefiting from the classes. Lateef credits her husband and children for supporting her work in this venture. Lateef's professional background is in finance. She has a degree from the University of South Florida. She originally moved to Ann Arbor fifteen years ago because of her husband's job. Lateef said, \"I love this town.\" As part of her commitment to health and nutrition, Lateef took part in the University of Michigan's Project Healthy Schools. Lateef served as a Health Ambassador going to different schools and educating students about nutrition. She took a break from the Health Ambassador visits as Peachy Fitness was getting started. Two interns from Eastern Michigan University, Alyssa Jeffries and Kristopher Lee, are another part of the Peachy Fitness team. Lateef praised them for their work on her website and for setting up the online registration. She said it is a team effort. Lateef has a full agenda of activities planned for summer 2015 at Peachy Fitness. In addition t o the regular summer session (June 22 - July 29), summer camps will run from June 22 through August 28 and include Yoga, Dance & Art Camp, Zumba & Art camp, and Combo Fit Camp. Lateef is also planning for the first Kids Night Out (parents drop off kids) in the fall. In addition to the studio space, there are \"party rooms\" for birthday parties or bachelorette parties and different options for yoga or Zumba parties.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 81 Classes are open to students at every level of yoga experience. Zumba and yoga both have choices for ladies-only classes. New clients may try one class before making a long-term commitment. Peachy Fitness requires a yearly registration fee of twenty dollars, and classes are paid for in advance. Lateef is also organizing childcare for some adult morning classes when there are enough participants who need babysitting in order to take a class. On Monday nights, the high-energy Zumba class (for ladies only) is followed by the Candlelight Yoga class. The classes are striking contrasts. One has loud music and bright lights, and the other is calming with only small flickers of light to help participants relax at the end of their day. Lateef oversees the transition with ease. She greets the new arrivals, accepts money, makes sure paperwork is filled out for new participants, all with a welcoming smile. Quickly the lights dim and calm music welcomes the nighttime class. Lateef is thrilled about bringing Peachy Fitness to Ann Arbor to help connect people with different varieties of yoga and physical fitness. For all of the parents who have been searching for yoga classes to enjoy with their children, their wishes have been granted.

Kids Write (Really Well) - Selections from 826michigan's The Circuit Maia Sears, Age 10 Fortis Academy Diary of a Bat Workshop: Busting Bat Myths: A Night in the Life of a Bat Dear diary, This morning, I woke up upside-down. My parents woke me up so that I wouldn't be late for flying practice. If I slept in late, then my mom wouldn't be happy. While I was stretching (upside-down), I stretched out and accidentally fell on top of my mom while she was waking up the rest of my family. (FYI, my flying practice is 7 hours long!) That is probably why mom doesn't get me a rock for me to ride on.When I got to the cave for flying practice, I suddenly remembered that I didn't have a single fly! Or grasshopper! I tried telling my coach that I didn't have any piece of food. But, of course, he was too busy teaching how to dive. Ryan Wang, Age 9 Lakewood Elementary School Bird for Short Monday Drop-in Writing One night, there was a bird named Bird That Sings At Night, Bird for short. Bird was a lark. He slept next to Crag With A Nest Full Of Birds, Crag for short. Bird also slept next to Lark That Rides The Wind, Lark for short. They were all friends. On another branch slept Moss That Clings On Rock, Moss for short. Next to Moss slept Rock That Tumbles Down Hills, Rock for short.One Morning Bird woke up, he was normally an early riser, carefully not to wake up Crag or Lark, and flew to a different tree to see Moon That Rises Over The Sun, Moon for short. Afterwards, he decided to go hunting. As he flew he saw a worm. He took it, ate it, and went to sleep. Alex VanLaven, Age 11 Thurston Elementary School Relaxation Workshop: Poetic Outlaws Right now it's time to be calm. Everything is as it should be,Late night snowfall out the window As a blazing hearth roars.Existing is a pleasure And soon it will be gone.Try to enjoy it,Into the cold night,On and Age: 12 Rudolf Steiner School Jackets Workshop: Poetic Outlaws Just warm Actually not too tight!Cool winds can't get in.Keen eyesight through snow have! Amelia Bertrand, Age 9 Haisley Elementary School Piggy Pink Workshop: Secret Life of Roy G. Biv Her shape is an oval. Her friends are Copper and Electric Lime. Piggy Pink's favorite game is to play pig tag with pigs around her. Piggy Pink is really good at drawing pigs. Piggy Pink likes to eat cupcakes with flamingo pink frosting and mulberry sprinkles. His favorite song is \"Jazzberry Jam\" because she wrote it herself. Piggy Pink is afraid of big fuzzy pink and plum monsters. For Piggy Pink's birthday she wants a very pretty pink computer that has 10 gold stars on the front, back, and both sides. Piggy Pink goes to Haisley Elementary School. Piggy Pink's mom is Plum and her dad is Raw Brown. She has 2 brothers whose names are Laser Lemon and Sea Green. Piggy Pink knows that she has to be invisible to spy on her friends, teachers, and family members. One day she went into her laboratory and she made a drink made of lemon silly spray and a piece of fur from a white kitten. Piggy Pink drank it and in 14 seconds she turned invisible. The first thing Piggy Pink was going to do was spy on her mom. She walked over to her parents and heard them talking about her. She listened hard to figure out what they were saying. \"I had a conference with Piggy Pink's teacher, Mrs. Tumbleweed,\" said Plum to Raw Brown, \"she said Piggy Pink disappeared in class right before class was over.\" \"Wow, that's weird,\" Raw Brown replied. \"Oh no!\" said Piggy Pink. \"They found out, hopefully they don't talk to me about it.\" Piggy Pink stopped spying on her parents so she would not get too scared. So she decided to spy on her friend Copper and have a playdate with Electric Lime. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 83 Linnea Nam, Age 8 Thurston Elementary School Roselena Workshop: Wee-bots! Once a princess named Roselena disobeyed her parents and believed in fairies. Her parents didn't like it and put a magic potion in her food so she would not believe in fairies. The fairies in a magic pot switched the potion to stop the parents. The next day her parents gave her more and after dinner they locked her in the bedroom. The next morning, Roselena woke up from a weird dream. In her dream she was growing wings. Then Roselena looked in the mirror and looked surprised because she had big fairy rainbow wings with spirals and a fairy on her shoulder! Mia Melendez, Age 8 Thurston Elementary School Halloween Toothfairy Workshop: Wee-bots! Once there was a witch who was tired of flying on her broomstick. She hated it because she always had to hold her broomstick. She wanted to steal stuff while she was flying. She wanted to steal things to keep them for herself. She was very selfish. The witch was a really tiny witch, the same size as the toothfairy. One day in the early morning the witch was flying on her broomstick and she saw a butterfly. The butterfly's wings reminded her of the Halloween toothfairy. She wanted to steal the Halloween toothfairy's wings and not the butterfly's because she didn't like the pretty colors like purple and pink. She liked how the Halloween toothfairy had Halloween colors on her wings like black and orange. One day the witch planned to steal the Halloween toothfairy's wings. She waited and waited in the same spot all day! Finally, it was the night time and as soon as the Halloween toothfairy came the witch jumped on her and stole her wings! As soon as she got the wings she did a dance. The witch ran back to her family and told them about all the excitement. It turns out that the Halloween toothfairy was hoping that someone would steal her wings because she was tired of her wings and she wanted a broomstick. The witch gave the Halloween toothfairy her broomstick. And then the witch and the Halloween toothfairy lived happily ever after! The End!

Can you tell us what you're offering? Pam Linn: I am offering therapeutic counseling sessions for children and youth that will have a mindfulness component in therapy, and I will also be teaching mindfulness classes to children. The classes I offer in mindfulness will be 8 weeks long and appropriate to each age level. I will be teaching modules on mindfulness breath, hearing, moving, eating, gratitude, and more. Bill Zirinsky: Your having opened up this kind of practice is another indication, to me, that \"mindfulness for kids\" is now , the time is ripe. I would guess you agree. Why is the time ripe, from your point of view? Pam Linn: Interesting that you ask about \"NOW\" since \"NOW\" is what we are teaching kids to be aware of in the present moment. Although relatively new, mindfulness for kids will be an essential practice for the tool box in life, as I see it. Children today are bombarded at a young age with technology, social media, organized sports, pushed down curriculum. They have less and less time to unwind, play, and just breathe. Mindfulness can help kids focus and attune to their day with a sense of calm, attention, and gratitude. Practicing mindfulness also cultivates empathy and compassion, all key elements for well-functioning youth. BZ: You are a school teacher by background. Please tell us briefly about your teaching background, and also how you came to be interested in teaching mindfulness to kids? Pam Linn: I have held a teaching certificate for 22 years and a Professional Counselor License for the past 16 years. I became interested in teaching mindfulness to youth when the evolution of social media, technology, structured lives, less time, more to do, became the norm for adults and children, including myself. I was witnessing the effects of this in my professional and personal life. Cultivating my own personal practice of mindfulness has changed my life. I know mindfulness is an amazing skill we can offer our youth. BZ: You've been teaching mindfulness to batches of kids in the Carman Ainsworth school district (near Flint) in which you work? What age group? How's it going? How do the other teachers feel about it? How about the parents? Pam Linn: I have been teaching mindfulness to students in the Carman Ainsworth Schools for the past year. I currently teach to kindergarten through third graders (approximately 300 students). We set aside time during lunch for staff who wish to practice also. The students and staff absolutely love it. My hope is to evolve into offering a Mindful Parenting class in the future. BZ: Are you teaching kids to meditate? Pam Linn: Mindfulness includes being aware of your thoughts, feelings, behavior. I am teaching kids to be aware and notice what is happening in the moment without judgment. One of the trainers once said, \"You are always mindful when you meditate but you do not need to be meditating to be mindful.\" BZ: Is this just for kids who have \"problems\" such as attentional issues or emotional issues? Pam Linn: Mindfulness is for everyone, all ages, all backgrounds. The more we are informed about our self through the practice of mindfulness, the better our ability to make thoughtful decisions in our lives. The research is showing long term positive impact on emotions, self-regulation, increased empathy and compassion for others and self. BZ: What ages? Tell us about mindfulness exercises you might do with 4 year olds, and what about with 7 year olds? And what about with 10 year olds and 13 year olds and 16 year olds? Pam Linn: A lesson on focusing on the breath would include adaptations such as: 4 year old: I may focus on the breath using a pinwheel. Breathing in and breathing out. Noticing how the body feels.7 year old: I may focus on the breath using a breathing buddy (Beanie Baby), placing the buddy on the abdomen, breathing in and breathing out, watching the tummy rise and fall with each breath. Noticing how the body feels.10 year old: I may focus on the breath in a standing position using the body as a pendulum. Inhale leaning to the right, exhale leaning to the left counting silently to 5 with each breath in and each breath out. Noticing how the body feels.13 year old: I may focus on the breath describing it like an anchor on a boat. We notice thoughts that come into our mind and float away, but our breath keeps us anchored. 16 year old: I may focus on breathing in and breathing out and attaching a number to each breath. If the students gets lost in their thoughts, to simply notice and start with one again. BZ: Please give us a few anecdotes of how you've seen mindfulness exercises affect kids? Pam Linn: 9 year old: \"Mindfulness helped me on a test when I got stuck on a math question.\" 8 year old: \"One time on the bus a girl was being mean to me. I took 3 mindful breaths and calmed down. I did the right thing and wasn't mean back to her.\" 15 year old: \"Mindfulness has helped me not worry as much. I am able to notice in my body when I'm worried and breathe through the anxiety and my body feels calmer.\" BZ: What is \"mindfulness based stress reduction?\"Pam Linn: MBSR or Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction is a term coined by Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn and strongly supported by the scientific and medical community. His program teaches mindfulness in the medical community to help alleviate stress, anxiety, pain and illness. His secular techniques have since spread throughout the world. BZ: What kind of training have you done in this area? Pam Linn: All of my training was received through Mindful Schools in California. I completed a year-long certification process in the summer of 2014. I was part of a cohort group that traveled from around the globe to receive the training. The training and the people who are drawn to it are truly amazing, as well as the lead trainers: Chris McKenna, Megan Cowan, Vinny Ferraro, and Pam Dunn. I am extremely grateful to have been given the knowledge and experience from Mindful Schools. BZ: And this training is based on the books and teachings of Jon Kabat-Zinn? And of others, too? Who else? Pam Linn: Here are a few names of other leaders in the Mindfulness movement. Dr. Daniel Goldman has written many books on social and emotional Intelligence. Dr. Daniel Siegel has written The Whole Brain Child and BrainStorm: The Power and Purpose of the Teenage Brain. Dr. Richie Davidson is a Researcher at University of Wisconsin-Madison and founder and chair of the Center for Investigating Healthy Minds. Gina Biegel has written The Stress Reduction Workbook for Teens: Mindfulness Skills to Help You Deal with Stress. BZ: The Crazy Wisdom Journal published an article in our Kids Section in our May thru August 2014 issue on the new Michigan Collaborative for Mindfulness in Education. How is what you're doing similar to, or different from, what they're doing? Pam Linn: I believe there are many similarities. Mindfulness helps with attention and focus, skills very necessary for success in the education world. BZ: How can Ann Arbor families connect with you? Pam Linn: Last fall, I was available for private consultations and classes at the Hygeia Center. I was doing private practice therapy with children and youth one night per week and the Mindfulness classes on Saturdays. I am hoping to continue sharing my experience with mindfulness for kids in the Ann Arbor community, and I'm also still teaching mindfulness to the kids in the Carman Ainsworth school district. BZ: Do you have your own family? Do you have kids? How old? Where do they live? Can you cite an example or two of how mindfulness exercises or education might have helped them, when they were kids? Pam Linn: I have two adult children, one local and the other in Tampa, and a senior in high school. My senior wasn't willing to give much attention to my work until he discovered many of his favorite icons have a mindfulness coach. The family member who has been the most open to practicing mindfulness is my granddaughter, who is 6. She regularly tells me times when she practices on her own. \"MiMi, I did mindful breathing when I had a bad dream the other night. It helped me a lot.\" BZ: What else would you like to get across to our readers? Pam Linn: Mindfulness is a basic life skill that everyone can benefit from with training, simply by cultivating purposeful attention to our lives. There is a growing body of research that is documenting the physical, social, and emotional benefits. Why not equip our youth with the best available life tools?

Correction: Lauren Zinn was inadvertently referred in last issue's Crazy Wisdom Kids in the Community column (\"ZinnHouse and Interfaith Minister Lauren Zinn\") as Rabbi Lauren Zinn when in fact she is Reverend Lauren Zinn. She was ordained in 2002 after participating in an intensive one-year program at All Faiths Seminary in New York City, founded by Rabbi Joseph H. Gelberman. Rabbi Gelberman also founded Rabbinical Seminary International and Lauren was enrolled in and completed coursework for this program but did not pursue final ordination due to cost. Had she done so, she would have earned the title of Modern Rabbi, not Rabbi, as this institution does not have the standard curriculum found in traditional rabbinic programs.

If so, it affects what goes up (spine, head, arm, hand) and what goes down (leg, ankle, feet, toes).My Journey to Postural Therapy Work I didn't set out to be a personal trainer, but in 1998 I became one. I had been a competitive powerlifter for years and learned the building blocks to building strength. I had a few great mentors, gentle giants, who were excellent teachers and coaches. I began offering Worksite Wellness Programs, passing along some of what I had learned, and through that, I discovered my love of teaching. In 2000, I opened Gym Giovino. As a trainer, I no- ticed that if a person had asymmetrical form while lifting weights, he or she couldn't make strength gains. In other cases, despite my hawk-eye for mon-itoring and coaching good form, people would expe-rience reoccurrences of old injuries. What I didn't know then was that you could correct form until the cows come home, but the root cause was postural misalignment, which weight training could never fix. I was introduced to the Egoscue Method by an acupuncturist in Florida, then reintroduced to it by a colleague here in Ann Arbor. The second time was a charm; I paid attention to this message. I read two of Pete Egoscue's books (Pain Free: A Revolutionary Method for Stopping Chronic Pain and The Egoscue Method of Health Through Motion ). It made perfect sense and this is what I had been looking for. The Egoscue Method is an exer- cise-based, pain-relief, posture-align-ing modality. It uses gentle exercises to correct postural misalignments and reintroduce proper body me-chanics. By performing a daily rou- tine, a client takes personal responsi-bility on his or her road to recovery. As a postural alignment therapist, I am able to analyze a person's posture and customize the routine to a cli-ent's particular situation. I got certified as a Postural Alignment Specialist in 2007. The massage therapist, the chiropractor, and the other personal trainer in my class had difficulties wrapping their heads around the prin-ciples and methodology. They were mapping their previous training onto this new method. Hearing their struggle helped me realize it was advanta-geous to forget what I had learned and be open to a new way of thinking. When a person is in pain, we need to look at the body as a unit instead of focusing on the part or parts that hurt. Pain can be the result of posture that is out of balance, front to back and side to side. When in pain we, as individ-uals, can be active participants in healing ourselves rather than having to be fixed by someone else. These were important lessons I brought back to Ann Arbor, starting my practice anew. The Anatomy of a Session The best way to communicate postural misalign-ment is through visual aids. To do this, I place sticky dots on the body at each of the load-bear-ing joints (ankle, knee, hip, and shoulder). Taking photos \u2014 front, back, and side views \u2014 allows me to add vertical and horizontal lines connecting the dots. And there you have it \u2014 the first step toward postural awareness. When people have this visual, they experience an \"a-ha\" moment: No wonder why I'm in pain. How did I get this way? Changes in our environment and lifestyle take place gradually and often go unnoticed. If you are old enough to remember, think about when there were no such things as garage door openers or TV remote controls. You had to get up to change the channel or get out of the car and open the garage door. Let's take away many more layers of mod-ern conveniences to a time when you had to build the fire to cook the food you grew in a garden or actively hunted. You collected the wood to build the fire, to make the tool, to cut the wood, to build the house. Technology takes away body movement. The less the body is asked to move, and the less our environment demands of us physically, the more restricted our movement becomes. This is a major cause of postural problems and pain. In a session I ask a client to do functional tests to analyze his or her movement. Walking, for instance, shows me where energy gets stuck and how a person compen-sates in order to get the job done. This gives me clues as to which of the 600-plus exercises I should have the client try. I say \"try\" because this is a partnership; the client knows best what he or she can do, and gives me feedback on the effects of a particular exercise. Even a nondescript \"I don't know, but I feel different\" is enough to know we're on the right track. And if we're not, we try something else until there's a positive change. Get this: the sight of the pain is not always the sight of the problem! A client could present with neck pain, or tinnitus, or plantar fasciitis, or bunions, and for any of those issues, my main focus is leveling the pelvis. One hip may be higher, or torqued or tilted, or all three. If so, it affects what goes up (spine, head, arm, hand) and what goes down (leg, ankle, feet, toes). You may think, Oh, I'll \"hold\" my pelvis in place, but actually, posturally, it's the muscles that tell the bones what to do, not your brain. And if the muscles on one side of the body are tight or strong and the corresponding muscles on the other side are loose or weak, then the bones will twist or tilt or elevate, and you can't think your way out of it. We need to even out the musculature, which evens out the bones, which evens out the posture, which eliminates the pain. This is done through personalized, therapeutic exercise. Athletes are especially good at hiding or com-pensating for postural dysfunctions. What do you think would happen if those were cleared? My goodness, huge gains in speed, flexibility, and strength. So back to the session \u2014 after the movement tests, I give the client a few exercises, finding the ones that change posture for the better and work to alleviate pain. Every possible restriction can be accommodated. If you can't get up and By Ann-Margaret Giovino Photos by Joni Strickfaden Ann-Margaret GiovinoThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 91 When a person is in pain, we need to look at the body as a unit instead of focusing on the part or parts that hurt. down off the floor, no problem; you can try seated exercises, or use the massage table, bringing the floor to you. If you can't kneel or your wrists hurt under pressure, I have work-arounds. It's important that a person isn't in pain during the exercises. We try different ones until we find a grouping that meets the goals of the session, constantly re-checking posture \u2014 have we released the pelvic twist, softened the excessive lumbar curve, reduced the forward head position, or alleviated a compen-sation in the client's gait? Great and Not Uncommon Results One client experienced huge changes after the first few exercises of the first session. This tall, slight, soft-spoken woman raised her fists as if she suddenly possessed a sense of \"fight.\" She felt like she could take on the world. She hadn't done bench presses or squats; she did gentle floor work and targeted isometrics. Good posture is strengthening. The better your posture, the stronger you feel. Strength training built on good postural alignment can dramatically increase strength. Yet another client, after doing three simple lie-down exercises, said, \"That did more for my back problems than seven months of physical therapy.\" Others have told me how deep and emotional this work is for them, and some describe it as an \"easy-looking\" workout that actually kicks their butt. The experience is different for each person, with pain relief and increased functionality being the common thread. Helping People A long, long time ago when asked in an interview what I wanted to do exactly, I answered with a clich\u00e9 \"I want to help people.\" But it was true! I just didn't know how, then, and I do now. Be still my heart when a client hugs me because their pain is gone for the first time, or when their journey up the flight of stairs from my gym to the first floor is easier and doable and surprising. As they leave, I smile. ### Ann-Margaret Giovino is the owner and operator of Gym Giovino, a private gym in Ann Arbor (www.gymgiovino.com).

Mariah Newborne: I offer health and wellness coaching for cancer survivors, energy healing, detoxification programs, and natural skin care. I am a licensed esthetician, a certified health and wellness coach, certified in the Ann Wigmore Detoxification Method, Tong Ren therapy, Jin Shin Jyutsu\u00ae, Reiki I, II, and III, MariEl Reiki, and Acupressure. All the products that I use are organic and natural, free of chemicals and preservatives. Maureen McMahon: Your specialty of coaching women who are cancer survivors is unique. What is your relationship to that? Mariah Newborne: In March of 2012, I was diagnosed with breast cancer and began my own healing journey. After learning a lot about self-care, health, and wellness, I wanted to support other women who were also going through a similar experience. For the past 35 years, and before becoming a full time coach and practitioner, I had two other careers, one as a puppeteer. I moved to Michigan in 2001, but I continued to commute extensively to New Jersey to perform puppet shows under a statewide recycling grant. I loved my puppets: sharing powerful messages and seeing excited audiences transform before my eyes into open, happy children. But I was unhappy traveling for work all year. I know that cancer may have shown up because of a multitude of reasons, but I believe stress was a big factor. I was traveling too much, chronically ill, not eating very well, overweight, and too afraid to let go of my income from New Jersey. When the doctor said to me \"you have cancer\" it was a wake-up call that has led me to create a new vision for myself and build a new life. I now feel 100 percent committed to my personal wellness while I create a business in Michigan that brings together all my gifts and passions to help others in a new way. Lately, my biggest why in life is to share how good it feels to be healthy. To share: when in doubt to follow your heart. I want to encourage women to opt-in after a cancer diagnosis, not as a victim, but as a warrior, and not just waiting for the next shoe to drop. We can do so much to help ourselves feel better even when we have something like cancer. It isn't easy to make a shift from feeling powerlessness towards personal empowerment, but the benefits outweigh the work it takes to be thrivers, not just survivors. I made a personal choice to address my cancer holistically by healing both my body and my being. I feel that through all the ups and downs, trials, fears, and shock that come with this experience, the most important thing has been to follow my heart. I have learned how important it is to go with what feels right while having a team of supportive doctors and friends. In the face of fear it isn't always easy to find our path and access our intuition. I ask myself, what feels like the best place for me to go and how can I help others? I'm inspired by helping women with cancer to have fun incorporating complementary self-care into their medical programs. Women are excellent caregivers but often lack in the same skills when it comes to themselves. Maureen McMahon: Along those lines, recently, for a women cancer survivors' wellness retreat, you wrote and performed a puppet show exploring your journey with cancer. How does embodying characters and using costumes help you to tell difficult stories? Or is the point more to make light of something serious? Mariah Newborne: Yes, I would say this show was my way of putting humor to something somber. There's nothing funny about tumors, but laughter heals your heart, and when your heart heals, your body follows.To me, healing is an energetic exchange, and with this, I'm touching others through my own vulnerability and willingness to share my feelings and to love without any walls. In this show, I talk to a puppet that represents me as a child in order to tell her how much she is loved and forgiven for all that she went through growing up. I am also using costumes and my breasts become puppets too, so it's fun! After 36 years, puppetry is a natural extension of myself and I'm comfortable communicating with it. This was what I call a \"light-weight\" production, not too many sets or moving parts. But it was also intended as a humorous exploration of what is behind the emotional realm of cancer. What is the wake-up call? What is the emotional connection? Is there a lack of self-care, those places that hadn't been learned as a child? It's a way of sharing where I'm re-doing things in my life to deepen my purpose. I believe that things repeat themselves in our lives so we can heal more deeply. One woman who saw the show said, \"You were telling me my life.\" I don't think it's a coincidence that women get tumors over their heart if they have not fully expressed themselves. Of course toxins can gather there. But energetically, the breast is the nest for your heart, other people's hearts, children, and loved ones. If there's trauma there, there is going to be stress, blockages, and issues. So, in the show, I use puppets to connect and heal the older parts of myself with my child self. I'm also thinking of adding in a puppet representing my future self who reassures me. But I have to figure out what she'd say! Most recently, in my \"Healthy Living\" video series, puppet Chefie, my assistant in the kitchen, and puppet Dr. Carrie, an experienced and caring self-care practitioner, demonstrate that being healthy can be easy and fun. Life is precious and mysterious and it is exciting that we can become master puppeteers of our own lives.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 107 This is for the girls \u2014 the majestic, innately beautiful girls who just can't seem to see their own beauty. The girls that are spending too much time on Instagram comparing their bodies and lives to strangers and celebrities they see on the Internet. This is for the girl who's getting more insecure of her body because she's trying to live up to a false expectation, an expectation that's been created by magazines telling her what beauty looks and feels like. Ten Moves for Flat Abs! The Skinny on how to be Skinny! How to Create Curves! All of it is a false interpretation of what your human body is all about. So girls, let's end this, because it's time to see past the illusion. Time to stand up and affirm your own worth and beauty on a daily basis because no one else will ever be able to affirm it enough for you. We're at a tipping point where modern science, yoga, mindfulness practices, and so on are all showing us that our words hold meaning, intention, and creation behind them. Let's utilize this knowledge, shall we? Let's begin to affirm that I am beautiful! You are beautiful! We are all beautiful! These things have to be said. The quicker you learn that you are what you think, the quicker you'll be able to live and walk in your own beauty, and my goodness, you have so much beauty to give because you're a goddess. This is for the girls \u2014 the one who is already insecure of her brilliance and uniqueness. The girl who dims it down so that others can shine, it's time for you to become as bright as you can. It's your time to become as great as you want to be. This world needs you to. It can be scary to step into your highest self, and at times, you'll ask yourself, \"Who am I to be great?\" The truth of the matter is who are you not to be? This is your one life, and you deserve to follow your own brilliance and uniqueness. You deserve to chase what makes your heart sing, what makes you the happiest and feel the most alive. Follow that luminosity, that vibrancy, and there will be no end to the amount that you'll be able to shine in this lifetime, you brilliant goddess. But what about the teenage girls? What about the girl whose friends are eating salads or counting calories in dressing? The girl with friends that have become dramatic, gossiping and continuously talking negatively about one another while they wait for the boys to call? Well, this is also for you. You don't need to participate in the drama \u2014 you have enough going on. What lies in these uncomfortable moments is an opportunity for you to make a choice as to how you show up. You can fall down in the drama, the gossip, the conniving ways of others, or you can take a different route where you attempt to learn how to be kind and accept your fellow sisters. You can make the choice right now to be great. Stand out! Stand proud because although the latter path is more difficult, it's also how you'll become part of the revolution, part of the luminosity that will make you such a brilliant woman. And so, this is really for the girls that decide to take part in the revolution. The girls who have decided to become women \u2014 beautiful, bold, and brilliant women \u2014 welcome. We're so happy you have joined us, and we wish you all the love and support you need to make the journey to your greatness as easy as it can be. Some of you will become caretakers, lovers, and mothers. Maybe you'll be the one to travel and attempt to make this world better as you look for those who need your help. Or maybe you'll be the one to travel out of amazement and curiosity, searching for depth and meaning. Some of you beautiful women will be the boss, while others will live in the simple bliss of a garden, while others will create, spreading joy through your art. Wherever your duties and paths lead you as a woman, there will always be the choice to live greatly, to live to your highest self, to live the life of a goddess. For all you girls and women, this is for you \u2014 this is for the goddesses that you all are \u2014 the too-luminous-to-put-into-words goddess. The one who uplifts, and defines her life's work as a co-creation, a collaboration in uncovering the highest amount of love, beauty, and kindness possible. This is for the goddess who moves diligently on her path while recognizing that she is more than the body, more than the job, the duty, even more than the mind. This is for all of you, because you all hold this bright goddess within. Hold her close, and when she seems to be hidden from view, unlock her with the breath; find her in the silence; remind yourself to act and speak from your highest place \u2014 that place of kindness, of love, and of sacred connection that only you understand. Affirm your inner goddess because you are what you think. Say it loud and with confidence. The quicker you connect with who you truly are, the quicker you'll be able to walk in your own beauty. Samantha Hart is a Canadian who moved to Ann Arbor for love. She is an advocate of healthy living through her passions of writing, cooking, and teaching yoga at local studios. As a member of The Self Love Project she attempts to explain through her writing the importance of self love (while stumbling to learn it herself).

This Is for the Girls By Samantha Hart The quicker you learn that you are what you think, the quicker you'll be able to live and walk in your own beauty, and my goodness, you have so much beauty to give because you're a goddess.You deserve to chase what makes your heart sing, what makes you the happiest and feel the most alive.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2015 Page 110 Sparking Your Divine Passion and Direction with Moonstone By Carol Clarke-Tiseo For centuries, moonstone has been considered a link to societal wonders and curiosities about the moon. The magic of the moon's properties and its effects on our behaviors and emotions have astounded people. The moon helps create the tides and has cyclic rhythms with Mother Earth. Moonstone gives us the connection with the moon that we long for and also calms and encourages us to create natural rhythms in our own lives and to be accepting of them. It also teaches us how change can open new pathways in our divine directions. Moonstone is reputed to also be good for stimulating new beginnings and for determining one's needs instead of wants. It opens the mind to hoping and wishing, inspiration and impulse, serendipity and synchronicity. This enchanting stone is a variety of orthoclase feldspar called adularia, which was named after the early mining site near Mt. Adular in Switzerland. It can mainly be found in Sri Lanka, Burma, India, and Madagascar. Moonstone can be colorless, white or ivory, silvery-gray, or bluish in color. Some pieces have a \"layered\" appearance while others are translucent, but all will have the characteristic luster that gives the stone a moon-like appearance. Moonstone has always been known for its calming and soothing effects on the combative waves of our emotional bodies. Its energy is balancing and healing, helping us to process our emotions rather than repress them. It also helps us identify emotional patterns that may or may not be serving our highest will. Moonstone acts as a mirror for our individual healing needs. It is a pure reflection for the person who owns it. It does not add or detract, but rather shows what is and can point out what needs to be. It also brings good fortune and new beginnings; enhances intuition; promotes inspiration; brings success in love and business matters; provides safe travel, offering protection on land and at sea; and promotes easy childbirth. Moonstone is used by healers to stimulate the functioning of the pineal gland and balance hormone cycles with nature's rhythms. Though often considered to be a woman's stone, it can be amazing for men as well, helping them to open up to their emotions and explore their feminine side. Moonstone is also the stone of love and eroticism, stimulating Kundalini energy and carnal desires. It may also alleviate degenerative conditions of the skin, hair, eyes, and the fleshy organs of the body. It is useful in treating insomnia and creating beneficial dreams, and is especially calming to children. It soothes those who are away from home for the night, drives away nightmares, and encourages sleep. It is also used to treat sleepwalking. The Many Varieties of Moonstone Blue moonstone is particularly helpful in seeing emotional patterns and life lessons, and in balancing yin and yang energies. Gray moonstone is a stone of perceiving beyond the veil \u2014 useful to the clairvoyant and shaman, and in moving one into unseen realms. White moonstone carries the energy of the new moon at the height of its power, stimulating psychic perception, vision, and dream work. Peach or yellow moonstone supports the heart as it stimulates the mind, soothing worry or anxiety and bringing out the best in people. Peach moonstone is particularly consoling to anyone who feels helpless because of weight problems, and should be worn to encourage people to love and value themselves for who they are, as is, and to assist in separating food from emotional needs. Rainbo w moonstone acts as a prism, diffusing energy throughout the aura. It provides psychic protection, clearing the mind and senses, and aids in lucid dreaming and calm sleep. It deflects negativity and eases emotional trauma. The Many Uses of Moonstone Simply holding moons tone while meditating can take one deep into the self \u2014 increasing intuition and psychic ability. Often it reveals the missing piece or pieces in one's life and parts of the soul that have been left behind or forgotten. Y ou can place a piece of moonstone on your sacral chakra to assist with menstrual dysfunction, helping to ease pain and regulate flow. Placing it here will also help with fertility problems and dysfunction. Y ou can also place it at the crown chakra. When our crown is in balance, our energies in our entire body are balanced. We know our place in the universe and see things as they are. Moonstone cleanses and dispels negativity from all the chakras, and provides supplemental energy and support in balancing the physical, emotional, and intellectual bodies.

In sharing our love for art \u2014 I'm a sculptor, and she's a painter \u2014 she described a course she was teaching on the Art of Mandala. She suddenly became quiet, looked at me in a knowing way, and declared: \"You are going to teach mandalas, and I will give you all the help to do that.\" And she did! While living in Greece, Poland, and India, I spent the next two years further studying the many meanings and approaches to creating a mandala. I also researched the writings of Carl Jung. He created mandalas to facilitate his own personal growth and awareness, as well as to help in his work with patients. Only then did I begin to teach this course on the Art of Mandala, and I've now taught it in Sweden, Finland, Switzerland, Greece, Poland, India, and the United States. Each culture had its own distinct articulation of the mandala based on its unique mythology and view of the Cosmos. Thus it was a very different cultural experience to teach in each country. The joy for me in sharing the mandala process was seeing the creativity emerge through students' mandalas. Students' eyes lit up seeing a new expression of art come from within. On a deeper level, many found insight into a deeper part of themselves and a reverence for the Art of Mandala. What Is the Meaning and History of the Mandala? The word 'mandala' is familiar to many people, and yet it may not be well understood. It has had many purposes, and for each purpose it has its own form and meaning \u2014 for meditation, artistic expression, or connecting with the inner self. Mandalas have been used in various ways by ancient and native peoples in many parts of the world, representing sacred wholeness or significance. Prehistoric humans, going back many millennia, represented the circle as a symbol, within which resided a potent spiritual meaning to the individuals and community. The Sanskrit word 'mandala' means a sacred circle or circular diagram. It was used for shamanistic rites so that tribes/communities could connect with a holistic sense of the divine with all of the Cosmos. Creating mandalas is still practiced around the world today in some native cultures. The Navajo continues to make the sand mandala with its symbols of life and fertile land. The Indian pilgrim meditates on the Yantra, a geometric triangular design within the circle, for awakening, or he circumambulates the sculpted mandala in representation of the Cosmos. The Tibetan monk meditates on the sacred circle of the Thangka for insight and awakening. Mandalas in Western Culture It was the English anthropologists and linguists that explored the Indian and Tibetan cultures in the 18th and 19th century. By learning ancient Sanskrit and Tibetan, they could begin to delve more deeply into the spiritual cultures and their symbols. The mandala form came to Europe in collections of the Asian spiritual cultures. In the 1920s, Carl Jung traveled to India. It was here that he discovered the mandala. It made a deep impression, and he returned to his home and used the mandala for both creative expression and deeper self- awareness. Carl Jung said: \"Mandalas symbolize a safe refuge of inner reconciliation and wholeness.\" After coming to understand the process in his own work, he began to guide his patients in using the mandala for deeper insight and expression. He shared his experience in working with mandalas with his followers, who continued the process for themselves and for their patients. The symbols and the expressions that came through were astounding, spiritual, and healing. About 60 years ago, one Jungian began to use this process as an art form, calling it the Art of Mandala, in which it was used for creative expression with awareness. To this day there are practitioners sharing this form of mandala art with students. The Art of Mandala I Teach The purpose of the class I teach is to affirm and nurture the creativity that resides in each of us. My goal is to help students realize the connection between what is in the heart and what comes through the hand as artistic expression. The mandala we create communicates from a deeper place within us, bringing awareness. This helps us to appreciate our intrinsic gift of creativity. Insight is here within for the taking. Beauty is within each of us. We each have inspiration and creativity residing within and accessible to each of us. The process of mandala making is beneficial to both the practiced artist and the first time participant. The course begins with a guided meditation to help the participant relax and be peaceful and receptive to one's inner intuition. When we look within and connect with this deeper place, a kind of dialogue unfolds in colors, patterns, or even energies. After the meditation, the participants create their own mandala. In expressing the Art of Mandala, we try to represent on paper, with a vast array of colors to choose from, what we have seen and experienced in the mind's eye. It is not a thinking approach but rather an intuitive/feeling approach to artistic expression. When creating a mandala for the first time, using oil pastels lends a freedom of expression and intensity of color to recreate that inner vision of the mandala on paper. Oil pastels, colored pencils, and even water colors are available. This is a fluid and deep form of artistic expression. It is a re-energizing and inspiring form, where one begins to perceive a new, sometimes previously unknown, integral creativity. Coming to trust the process and expression enhances not only one's art but one's life as well. Joan Skolimowski studied Spanish and psychology and has an M.A. in Early Childhood Education. She has also studied sculpture, and has been sculpting for the last 24 years. She has been teaching the Art of Mandala over the last 15 years in Europe, India, and the U.S. She has been offering this course at VEO Art Studio for the past two years.
