We recommend this oil for working with the triple goddess, inspiration, creativity, and healing. Sun's Eye oils are highly concentrated blends of essential and fragrance oils, which are synthesized from a wide variety of ingredients. These ritual oils are petroleum-free, paraben-free, DBP, and DEHP-free, as well as being vegan. All our oils are body grade; however, they are highly concentrated, and we recommend them to be diluted with a carrier oil such as jojoba or grapeseed oil for body use. All oil formulas are based on traditional and time-honored associations that are mindfully crafted with intention in mind. Our products are tools to remind the user of their intention. No guarantee of results is implied. These are for external use only. Do not ingest. Keep away from children and finished surfaces. Size: One half ounce bottle. Additional Details - "}
