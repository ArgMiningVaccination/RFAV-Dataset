San Francisco Department of Public Health adopts new public health guidelines on masking outdoors On May 3, Acting Health Officer Dr. Susan Philip released the following stat ement after a decision by the state to generally align with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) new guidance on ma sking for fully vaccinated and unvaccinated people. For the purposes of this guidance, people are considered fully Health Commission May 4 , 2021 Page 3 vaccinated for COVID -19 two weeks after they have received t he second dose in a two -dose se ries of Pfizer - BioNTech or Moderna vaccines, or tw o weeks after they have received a single -dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Currently, individuals 16 and older are eligible to get vaccinated in San Francisco. \"The C DC's announcement that fully va ccinated, and in some instances unvaccinated, people no longer need to wear masks in certain outdoor settings is fantastic news that reflects the science and data we now have on the efficacy of the vaccines in preventing comm unity spread and driving down c ase rates and the minimal risk o f transmission outdoors. We welcome the state's decision to adopt these common -sense guidelines and we hope it further incentivizes people to get vaccinated as soon as possible. We are going to be updating our health orders and various directives to reflec t these changes. That will likely take several days. However, our local face covering order will be updated sooner.\" \"These changes mean fully vaccinated and unvaccinated people can forgo mask -wearing while engaging in out door activities such as walking, running, hiking or biking alone or with members of the same household. And, you will no longer need to pull up your mask when simply passing others by on a sidewalk or trail as the transient pa ssing of people is not a risk of transmission. For anyone who i s fully vaccinated, a face covering will no longer be required outdoors unless a more specific rule requires it, such as at a large sporting event. For people who are not fully vaccinated, a f ace covering must be worn if p hysical distancing cannot be main tained. For example, if you are not fully vaccinated and stop to have a prolonged conversation, or you are walking on a crowded sidewalk passing many people, you will want to put that mask on. And for now, everyone, inclu ding fully vaccinated and unvacci nated people, must still wear a face covering at large events or crowded settings outdoors. In San Francisco, this means any event or location with 300 or more people.\" \"Because their risk level is significantly lower , vaccinated people now have more latitude and do not need to wear a mask for most outdoor activities other than those that are crowded. After we reach the state's yellow tier, fully vaccinated people can also dine outdoors at a restaurant with friends fr om multiple households without mas ks. We anticipate that will begin on May 6 along with some other industry -specific changes. As before, fully vaccinated people do not need to wear a mask while attending small private gathering s indoors with fully vaccinat ed family and friends or with one unvaccinated household that is low risk for COVID -19.\" \"We all still need to keep our masks handy as they should be worn outside if you are unvaccinated and cannot easily maintain 6 -feet dist ance; in settings where other rules still require masking outdo ors; as soon as you go inside to most business settings; or in large group settings such as outdoor music festivals or sporting events, including in fully vaccinated sections. When it comes to unvaccinated youth over the a ge of two, they should keep their masks on while interacting with other youth from different households in outdoor settings such as the park or at school recess.\" \"While you may be able to walk to a destination without one, you'll need to put your mask on when you enter an indoor public space such as a store, restaurant, gym, salon, or movie theater \u2014any place where the vaccination status of other people is unknown. The federal masking requirements for public transportation w ill still apply, so you will need to wear your mask while waiting for and while riding public transit. We also urge vaccinated residents to wear masks when visiting indoors with unvaccinated peopl e who are at increased risk for severe COVID -19 or unvaccinated people from multiple households. Remember, c hoosing outdoor over indoor gatherings and activities is your safest bet.\" \"We hope this news offers further incen tive for people to get fully vaccinated as soon as possible. The longer you wait, including deferring your second shot if you need one, the greater the risk of Health Commission May 4 , 2021 Page 4 contracting COVID -19 and passing it on to a friend, loved one or co -worker. Vaccines are general ly available to anyone age 16 and older. Our continued success and our City's economic health depend on everyone who is eligible getting vaccinated. San Francisco has done an amazing job throughou t this pandemic because of everyone's commitment to followin g the health guidelines. Let' s keep up the good work so we can continue to reopen our City and resuming the activities we love.\" The Face Covering Order will be updated soon. Other items, including that S tay-Safer -At-Home Order and many directives, will be updated when the City is assigned to the yellow tier by the State in order to clarify additional situations where a mask does not need to be worn when outdoors.

Bookman Community Center and Visit Healthcare to officially launch a new neighborhood COVID -19 vaccine s ite at 50 Broad Street in the Ocean View neighborhood.

Health Department continues mobile COVID vaccination efforts with residential treatment program clients On April 15, SFDPH 's Behavioral Health Services (BHS) and Whole Person Integrat ed Care (WPIC) came together for a mobile vaccination event at Progress Foundation's Clay Street Residential Treatment Program. With the support and expertise of the WPIC mobile vaccination team, 53 residents received their first dose of the COVI D-19 vacci ne. The collaboration came about w hen Devora Keller, Medical Director of Medical Respite and Sobering Center and Supportive Housing Nursing Programs and the WPIC vaccine lead, offered BHS operationa l and logistical support and staffing to help vaccinate a group of Progress Foundation resid ents who were unable to get vaccinations on their own due to severely impairing behavioral health needs. The vaccination team consisted of staff and volunteers from WPIC and BHS as well as traveling nurses from around the country and retired SFDPH and BHS providers . The SFDPH will continue supporting efforts and partnering with community to ensure vaccinat ion access for populations with higher risks. San Francisco opens prayer/reflection rooms at high volume vaccination sites for Ramadan On April 26, SFDPH and the Department of Emergency Management announced new prayer/reflection rooms at San Francisco's high -volume COVID -19 vaccination sites during Ramadan. Created in collaboration with District 6 Supervisor Matt Haney and Human Rights Commissioner and Int erfaith Council Board M ember Hala Hijazi, the initiative helps support equitable vaccine access for Muslims during the month -long religious celebration and beyond. Health Commission May 4 , 2021 Page 5 Ramadan, observed between April 12 and May 12, is considered one of the holiest months o f the year for Muslims. In addition to including a safe space for prayer/reflection, the SF Market in the Bayview and Moscone Center vaccination sites have a system in place to allow individuals who step aside to pray to keep their place in line as well as a designated area in w hich they can break their fast with access to drinking water. Muslims pray five times a day and fast between dawn and sunset during Ramadan. Open to all faiths, the prayer/reflection rooms offer privacy from public view, are outfitte d with prayer rugs and are large enough to accommodate social distancing. San Francisco, which is home to approximately 7,000 Muslims, modeled its guidelines and best practices to allow Muslims to access vaccines during Ramadan from a program of the New York City Commission on Human Rights. The initiative's literature, which suggests offering service during hours when people will not be fasting, is being disseminated at the vaccination sites in English and Arabic. Health Department launches 'Have GOOD Sex' camp aign In April, SFDPH launch ed a new social media campaign: Have GOOD Sex. The goal of the campaign is to address the stigma associated with sex and sexuality and create a place for conversations on sexual health and pleasure. Everyone deserves sex ual healt h without stigmatization. Have GOOD Sex will also jumpstart conversations about consent and empowerment, because good sex isn't just safer sex. Good sex is inclusive \u2014 it's devoid of shame and it's for everyone. With a focus on Black and Latinx Sa n Francis cans ages 18 -49, and promoted by local influencers, Have GOOD Sex will combine social media with social influencers to move with culture and be a part of the conversation. Have GOOD Sex will also promote the recently launched TakeMeHome project, which provides San Franciscans with access to free HIV and STD screening in the privacy of their own home.

Commissioner Commen t: Commissioner Bernal stated that the great DPH leadership , extra ordin ary wor k of all DPH staff and its partn er organizations , and coo peration of San Francisco re sidents , helped stem the pandemic. Com missioner Bernal noted the leveling off of vaccine d istribution and asked which populatio ns need additional focused outreach. Director Colfax s tated that there is focus on younger populations since this group has only recen tly been approve d for the vaccine. He added that a ke y factor in he lping people with vaccine hesitancy is to encourage them to talk to th eir primary care provider s so the DPH is working to link indiv idua ls to providers . The DPH is also working with community leaders to ensure the DPH is aware of concerns from all grou ps. He also stated that al though not ev eryone may choose to get vaccinat ed, the DPH is striving to explain the benefits of getti ng vaccinated . Currently 86% of those 65 years and older have been vaccinated. Commis sioner Chow asked if the DPH is changing its vaccine aware ness messaging since the target audien ce is now a younger audie nce. Director Colfax stated that the DPH has been working with the school distr ict and other organizations serving youth in an effort to support this pop ulation getting vaccinated , including providing informed consent forms for those youth under 18 years o ld. He added that the more people who are vaccinated, the less the city needs to be concerned about impact of possible variants. Commissioner Chow asked for an upda te on reopening schools an d institutions of higher learning. Dr. Susan Philip, Health Offi cer and Director of the Population Health Division , stated that the DPH is working closely with the Park and Rec reation Departme nt to plan school graduations held at Kezar sta dium to en sure spacing between events and appro priate social distancing protocols are in place. She added that the COVID -19 Comm and Center School Team has been working with the San Francisco United School District and private schoo ls for vaccine distribution to stud ents and their families.

He thanked everyone who gave input along the way to this step in the process. Public C omment: Martha Lauren has worked as a bio medicine tech at San Francisco General Hospital . She sup ports expanding the BERT teams and incorporating un ionized community safety teams. A UCSF medical student spoke about caring for a patient on a psychiatric hold who was ph ysically attac ked by Sheri ff's deputies when staff called t hem to assist with the patient. Later when two patients were having issues, a staff member was unsure whether to call the Sheriff due to the violence that had ensued from the last call f or help. He said a behavioral health specialty team is needed to de-escalate patients and he advocates for piloting a community safety team to manage situa tions in which staff and patients have conflict. Danielle is a famil y physician working at Castro Mission Health Center and ZSFG. She told of a n incident in which a developmental ly delayed patient becam e agitated and was triggered when he saw Sheriff 's deputie s. He swung at the deputies so they arrest ed him. H e was transferred to jail, which was heartbreaking to witness someone so vulnerable going through a ver y unfair and dif ficult time because the syst em is not prepared t o deal with these situ ations. She does not feel that having Sher iff's deputies at the hospital or cli nics is the appropriate plan to addres s these situations. She advoc ated for trauma -informed systems. Lena is a fourth year medical stud ent and a member of \"DPH M ust Divest. \" She urged the He alth Commission to support the BERT team and reduction in Sheriff 's deputies at the DPH. She advocated for the creation of a union rep resented community safety team in the pri mary care clinics. Jenni fer Friedenbach , Executive Director of Coalition on Homelessness, stat ed that it is impo ssible to provide trauma informed care when t here are armed paramilitary forces at the door of DPH clinics and hospitals. She is not in favor of continuing employment of Sheriff 's deputies at Tom Waddell because they harm and traumatize the patients. She noted that there are many homeles s organizations and s helters w ithout armed security. She advocated for all staff having de-escalation skills. The success of the BERT teams and cadets will depend on whether they are actuall y integrated into the clin ical team s. Naomi , nurse practi tioner in primary care and street medicine, advocated for mo ving away f rom h aving law enfor cement in healthcare s ettings. She urged support of the BERT teams and creation of a union repr esented Health Commission May 4 , 2021 Page 10 community safety team in primary care clinics. She opposes u se of non -uniform cadets and Sheriff 's deputies at the DPH sites. Sarah Shock, UCSF patient, witnessed a parent of a patient receiving a terminal di agnosis, have an e motional reaction to the news. The security staff dragged him a way in handcuffs. She urged support of the BERT teams and creation of a union repr esented community safety team in primary care clinics. She op poses u se of non - uniform cadets and Sheriff 's Deputies at the DPH sites. A physician at ZSFG, called for reduction in Sheriff deputies ' presence at DPH sites and supported BERT teams. He opposes use of non -uniform cadets. He has witnessed many incidents in wh ich a patient was experiencing a mental health c risis or behaving inapp ropriat ely due to an underlying medical condition . When staff called the Sheri ff for assistance , the situation was quickly escalated to frequent assault of the patients, who are pr imarily people of color. He noted that another incident involved a patient picking up HIV medications at the ZSFG pharmacy. A deputy at the door saw that the patient had an old warrant and arrested her. This patient will likely never pick up meds again fro m the ZS FG pharmacy. Another incident involved a Spanish spe aking patient going through alco hol withd rawal . A Spanish speaking deputy was called to assist and quickly assaulted the patient with a laser. Teresa Rutherford, SEIU 1021, called to support the plan put forth by the DPH to ex pand the BERT t eams and create a more t rauma informed approach . She advocated for using a healthcare focus instead of a militarized focus, which has a long history of targeting communi ties of color. She advocated f or using u nionized staff who are proper ly trained and supported before the re moval of exi sting se curity syste ms. Dr. Le igh Kimb erg, attending physician at the ZS FG Richard Fin e's People 's Clinic and memb er of DPH Mu st Divest, stated that a deep sense of safety is n ecessary for healing. The proposed plan is a major step forward in investing in the BERT team , which can help prevent escalat ion. She is al so excited about the concept of care expe rience workers to be culturally rooted and contribute to a community -driven m odel of support. An individual stated that as frontline workers need assistance, there are currently two options: either call law enfor cement , and many ti mes that results in deputies pulling out a weapon on a non -violent patient, or feeling \"over my head ,\" and neglecting other patients due to dealing with a patient in crisis. It is time there was a better option that provides ther apeutic alternatives with hig hly trained workers. A UCSF health researcher advocated for using unio nized SFDPH workers because non-profit contractors cann ot be held accountable to the s ame standards , nor do Sh eriff's deputies have the skills to address the needs of the patie nts. Sh e advocated for unionized positions. She noted that 75% of the DPH M ust Divest group resp onded that the presence of deputies increases violence. She advocated for a lternatives to policing that will create good jobs for San Francisco residents. A ZSFG physician called to speak on behalf of the ir patients, colleagues, and communi ties. They urged the Health Commission to prioritize the safe ty of patients by increasing me ntal health crisis response teams and decrease reliance on the deputies.

Julie Roberts stated that she has had i mmediate family and neighbors needing mental health services and it has been disheartening to have police involved when they s ought help. Patient care situations need compassionate and skilled community workers who are union ized staff, to encourage longevity in these Health Commission May 4 , 2021 Page 11 important roles. Tanzanika Ca rter, Ass istant Sheriff, s tated that if there is an issue with any deputy, contact th e Sheriff 's Office , Internal Affairs I nvestigation, or submit a Whistleblo wer complaint because the Sheriff 's Departm ent does not tolerate the type of incidents being described in the publ ic comm ent. Th e Sheriff is committed to working with the DPH to meet the needs of its patient population . A small business owner and anti -racism educator, urged the removal of law enfor cement deputies from public health settings. The person noted that for many black and brown San Francisc ans, seeing a uniformed person triggers them t o experi ence a nega tive response. The person advocated for unionized staff who can be tr ained in de-escalation and not wearing uniforms. The caller noted that the H ealth Commission has recognized anti- black racism as a public health emergency and needs to ensure that DPH clients do not further experience racism and other forms of harm. Instead, the DPH should provide a healing experience. A call er stated that \"We're he re today, still harmed and brutalized. \" She added that on Jul y 8th of last year, she witnessed an incident inv olving six ar med deputies that was traumatizing. The deputies laugh ed at her when she asked for their badge numbers. She fears going into her midwife clinical practice because she is unsure which deputies were involved in the incid ent. She pr ovides care for members of her community and identifies with the victim of the incid ent. She noted that in the U nited States , less than 1% of heal thcare facil ities a re polic ed, so why are the DPH healthcare facilities staffed with deputies? She enco uraged reimagining what true safety looks like. \"We believe in you. We hope that you do too and make informed decisions on what is best for all of us, not just the selected few. \" Shakira, a primary care physician and member of DPH Must Dive st, supports the expan sion of the health response team and the reduc tion in Sheriff 's deputies. \"We believe anoth er wor ld is possible. \" Jessica Hawkins, former ZS FG employee and current UCSF medical student, is happy to hear the Commission supports the expansion of the BERT te ams. She encouraged a reimagining of the role of experie nced health care workers to lif t up the community and create a safe and health y clinical envir onment. She said that a patient with a new born discour aged her loved ones to visit bec ause of the presence of a deputy made her feel unsafe. She shared another incident in which a n individual was waiting in the ZSFG Emergency Depar tment for 14 hours . Deputies tackled th is individual from behind with a lobby full of other people who looked just like the patient . She indicated it was devast ating and heartbreaking to witness for those in a hospital looking for healing. Jessica Maw, UCSF medical st udent and member of DPH and W hite Coats for Black Lives, supports the expansion of the BERT teams and re duction of the deputie s. She called on the DPH and Commission to eliminate use of cadets be cause they cannot be held to the same standard of training and accountability as a DPH union -represented employee.

Health Commission May 4 , 2021 Page 12 The caller read a s tatement on behalf of a ZSFG reg istered nurse working in the Psychiatry Depar tment. ZSFG's goals to be the best public hospital cannot happen until we cr eate a truly pati ent-centered healing environment. The nurse is in favor of expanding the BERT team and the use of unarmed mental health professional s to de-escalate situations. T he nurse has witnessed many patients that have felt threatened by police and/or deputies. This brings more trauma to a place that is supposed to empo wer pat ients to heal and recover. Assumptio ns should not be made about pat ients based on their immi gration status or th e color of their ski n. The nurse has witnessed many Black pa tients frantically kne eling on the floor with their hands up, when there was no cau se for this to occur . Jessica read a statement by Arena Alexander, licensed mental he alth therapist. She supports the efforts to expand the BERT team. She noted that many people who are unhouse d and of lower income e xperience so much fear about coming to the hospital because they will have to interact with dep uties. One patient , who had just been relea sed from jail was very sick with a fever , but was scared of interacting with de puties and bein g arrested again. \"Accessing medical treatment should never be a pun ishment. \" A caller read a s tatement for Danielle Herre ra, a comm unity mental health therapi st, working in the shelter -in- place hotels .

She asked the Commission to reject the DP H prop osal to hire health care security offi cers and instead, pilot a community led trauma info rmed safety team in the primary care clin ics. She also advoca ted for improving the staffing ratio s for nurses. She has witnessed many incidents of an individ ual experiencing a severe physical health issue and instead is punished by the dep uties . LJ Johnson, social worker and member of DPH Must Div est, stated that her patient s, LGBTQ youth, experien ce the deputies as a deterrent to accessing care. A former patient was terrified to disclose suicidal idea tion due to fear that someone wou ld call the police to make a wellness check . The patient was fear ful of being brutalized by p olice. Unarmed skilled teams of mental health professiona ls and social workers and community members trained in de-escalation and trauma informed care are proven to be an effective alternative for law enforcement for health -related issues . A UCSF medical student urged the Commis sion to sup port the expansion of the behavioral health response teams and piloting union represented community safety teams in the primary care clinics. The person oppose s the use of non -uniformed cadets. The caller helped a frien d go to ZSFG for care . The friend is Latinx and has had multiple friends killed by the police. She was shocked at the number of deputies at the hospital. There are deputies w hen you ar rive and one in the Emergency Depart ment. ZSFG calls the San Francisco P olice Department to sit outside the door. She noted that they in teracted with 6 police offi cers. W hen she told the nurse they were uncomforta ble with the amount of deputies, the nur se rep lied, \"They are here for your safety. \" The caller indicated that this had not been their experi ence. The ca ller dropped a friend off for surg ery at ZSFG and 8 Sheriff 's cars s urrounded his car , in order to rush to get a Black man in a wheelc hair. They took his stuff away and searched it and all of his pockets. A Black doc tor asked wha t the deputies were doing. A deputy responded , \"What are you doing? \" The caller indicated it was a demorali zing e xperience.

She supports a pilot of community safety teams in primary care clin ics. She noted that St. Anthony 's Client Safety S ervices is a team of peo ple with community kno wledg e and training to de- escalate situations with c ompassion. She does n ot support p lain cloth es cadets. Health Commission May 4 , 2021 Page 13 The caller, a midwife , spoke about how violence fr ames the work and is incompati ble with law en forcement on a clinic campus. Patients have told her that they could not seek care because someone in uniform was outside the birthing unit. Patients are not cri minals and should not be treated that way -especially the Black/African American community. She noted that there is scientific evidence that repeated trauma causes a physiological response. The current system is costing th e DPH countless dollars in sick leave for staff, and the cost of treating the medical con ditions we are causing or exac erbating . The DPH touts science when it is about COVID but are hypocrit es to advocate for continue d use of law enfor cement, when there is evidence of its harm in healthcare settings. LJ read a s tatement on behalf of M ontilda Flemming, who supports the expansion of the behavioral response team , defunding the use of deputies, and c reating community safety teams. She also called f or improving the staffing ratios and opposes the use of ununiformed c adets. The c aller read a statement on behalf of A lex Markovich, who endo rses removing security officers in health care settings. The deputies are ill equipped to deal with mental health matters. He noted that 44% of service calls to the deputies were related to patient care issues. These comp lex patient situations requ ire compassion and well trained community workers . He supports union jobs. The caller read a statemen t on beha lf of Katrina Seraldo , medical provid er, who takes care of pat ients who are disproportiona tely impacted by the war on drugs, and the refore polic ing. A patient with a sub stance use disorder discussed his discomfort with telling the truth about his health issues around the de puties. We must not invest in policing our patients at the ir most vulnerable mo ments. Stephanie Freeman read a statement o n behalf of Kara Levy, who urged the Com mission to support the expansion of the BERT teams to keep the most vulnerable patients safe . When pat ients are in crisis they deserve to be met by a team of trained , unarmed , mental health speciali sts, no t law enfor cement. A caller read a statement on behalf of a former DPH employee, who worked in primary care and at Laguna Honda Hos pital. The person called on the Commission to reject the DPH proposal for hiring security cadets. The person urged support for a community led trauma informed team in the p rimary care cli nics and improved staffing rati os for nurses. We need r obust c ompen sation for staff on the community s afety teams. A DPH nurse working in o utpatient care stated that she witnessed an incident in which a n African American patient nodded off and the deputy tr ied to wake the patient, who freaked out and they t umbled to the ground. The patient was denied service to the clinic going forward so he lost his primary care clinic. The Sheriff 's deputies are allowed to arrest anyone with an outstan ding warrant, even when they are seeking medical care. Another incident involved a trans woman who was a clin ic patient and was experiencing me ntal health issues. When the deputy approach ed her, she r an away, and the deput y tackled and handcuffed her. Claire Warren, a social worker, urged the Comm ission to expand the behavioral health response team and patient sup port services. When police are the first responders to a mental health situation , the first t hing that comes to mind is h oping the person does not en d up dead. Having social workers and peo ple in the helping profession as first responders would be the correct dir ection towards prov iding proper care to our com munity. Commissioner Commen t: Commission er Chow asked for more infor mation on the anticipate d trai ning of c adets . He also asked how UCSF handles it s security . Mr. Price stated that cadets are civilia ns within the Sheriff 's office who are not trained nor on track for law enfor cement positions . The se are career cadets that go through a trai ning process to be p repared for their roles in security. Reg arding UCSF, Mr. Pr ice stated that it uses a hybrid model of he althcare security officer s and law enfor cement. The goal of the hybrid model enabl es an intermediate unarmed response to support clinical staff with pat ient inter ventions. If a situation rises to a Health Commission May 4 , 2021 Page 14 point of danger , law enforcement can be called in to assist. Commission Christian made the following comments: \"Thank you, Pres ident Bernal. First I want to thank Director Price for his obvious and ongoing de dication to the safety of the workers at the D epartment of Public He alth at var ious ho spitals. I 've been on the Com missi on a little less than a year, but even in that time, I have learned because of your presentations and the way that you speak to us about this work that you take this incredibly seriously, that you take the safety of each worker at the hospitals seriously, as well as the patients and the community member s who have a right to access health with out being frightened for their own safety. So I also want to acknowledge the fact that in the last year and longer than tha t for many people, and I 'm sure your experience with this exceeds many of ours, it has become clear that po licing as an institution at ever y level is structurally and foundationally in need of great change. And given that we 're at this momen t and we 're looking at how to create safety within the community and specifically in the context of DPH and I know that you 're looking at it on a minute by minute basis, can you let us know why this is the right choi ce to move away from the Sher iff, but still stay with the ca dets, who ar e as I understand it, civilians who have no expertise other than what they 're given ...why it 's appropriate to go in that direction rather than to go in the direction of the clinically trained people could be given instruct ion in what ever additional instruction they need to incr ease the level of safety and to de -esca late things. Why is it appropriate to go in th is direction now rather than to move in the direction of expanding the behavioral health response teams ?\" Mr. Price stated that in re gard to a healthcare setting, that the DPH wants to make sure its pati ents are safe. In regard to the choice of cadets, the DPH saw this a s an opportunity for change within a clinical model. The DP H wants to take this change m anagement process in phases, evaluating and measuring success before moving forward with additional improvements. Commissioner Christian made the following com ments: \"I thank you for your response. I think I want to e mphasize what everyone else is feeling. We're at a time where we nee d to imagine boldly and to tak e bold steps and whether , I appreciate your expertise and this is your work and I'm not telling you anything yo u don't know better than I do , we have a lot at stake here , and public health is our responsibility , and law en forcement and public he alth don 't mi x very well together .\" Commissioner Giraudo thanked Mr. Price for his pres entation and said she looks for ward to the implem entation of the innovative BERT teams. She encouraged the de partment to reconsider only providing updates on t raining on an annu al basis for the cadets, especially during the first year. She suggested th at cadets re ceive training every six months to address problems and issues that arise. Commissione r Chung joins her fellow Commissioners in thanking Mr. Price for his innov ative work and for all those w ho made pu blic comment. She too has experien ced stigma from Sheriff 's deputies re garding past clients who experience d mental health and substance use issues. She asked if there is a mechanism set up so the commun ity can give feedback on this new model as its implemented . This would en able the DPH to hear about what th ose directly impacted have witnessed and exper ienced . She noted th at the plan presented is a transitional step in the right direction. She noted that it is necessary to ackn owledg e that the city burea ucracy is challenging. She also stated that the Commission is h ere to su pport these important changes and is to make sure there remains an open dial ogue between the DPH and community regarding the implementation. Commi ssioner Green thanked all those who made public comment and noted tha t the community is like minded in rega rd to the ne ed for change. She also stated that as a hospital worker, she has witnessed many of the kinds of incidents described in the public comments. The firs t person she encou nters when she walks into work is a security office r, and it does not create a good atmos phere. She is appre ciative that the prop osed plan is an initia l plan, not a final plan. She h opes that the DP H can learn quickly and that hiring the B ERT staff quickly will be a priority . She added that we need well trained workers to make this plan wor k. Health Commission May 4 , 2021 Page 15 Mr. Wagner sta ted that prior to finalizing this in itial plan, there were conver sations with sta keholders. The DPH plans to continue conversations with sta keho lders as the plan is implement ed. Director Colfax thanked everyone who made public comment and acknowledged Mr. Price 's expertise and extensive pla nning process which resulted in the current p lan. 9) FY2021 -22/ FY22 -23 B UDGET Jen Louie, DPH Chief F inanc ial Office r, presented the item.
