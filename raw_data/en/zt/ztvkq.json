Mind-Body-Connections I specialize in [mindfulness](https://www.goodtherapy.org/learn-about-therapy/types/mindfulness-based-interventions), [self-compassion](https://self-compassion.org/test-how-self-compassionate-you-are/), embodied practices and [somatic therapy modalities](http://www.goodtherapy.org/learn-about-therapy/types/somatic-psychotherapy) that connect the mind and body for effective and lasting results at reducing symptoms of anxiety, depression, PTSD, grief and other challenging life transitions. Safely Embodied I believe optimal wellness comes from feeling connected to our essential, wise nature within and to the larger natural world around us. Mindfulness practices connect our mental awareness to our senses in a kind, non-judgmental manner. With practice, this loving, accepting and connected presence to ourselves allows greater access to the intuitive wisdom of our body/psyche. From this compassionate embodied place, we can address and clear limiting patterns and find a greater sense of ease and possibility. I use guided awareness practices, conscious movement, art and journaling and other grounding techniques to assist you in learning to trust the safety of your own body awareness and organic intelligence. EMDR is considered a somatic therapy because the mind and body work together to \"desensitize\" and \"reprocess\" negative experiences. Other modalities I use include: Mind-Body Bridging, Somatic Experiencing, Mindful Self-Compassion, guided imagery, therapeutic journalling and conscious movement. I have a personal background in mindfulness meditation techniques including Vipassana or Insight meditation. "}
