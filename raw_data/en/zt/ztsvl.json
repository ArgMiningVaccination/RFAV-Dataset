An infant is a child in the earliest period of life up to 12 months of age, while a neonate is a newborn infant who is less than four weeks old . For many years, procedural pain and distress in both neonates during the first 28 days of their lives and older infants (up to one year of life) have been under-studied and under-treated . Several reasons have been proposed for this, such as a belief that neonates and infants do not fully experience pain as adults do (Derbyshire 1999), concern regarding the risks associated with using analgesics and the inability of infants to verbalise their pain. Recent evidence suggests that neonates and older infants do feel pain . Increasing attention has been directed towards pain and distressreducing strategies during painful procedures such as immunisations because of possible short-and long-term adverse effects. As a consequence, there has been increasing interest in the use of pharmacological agents such as local anaesthetic creams (Taddio 1998)... Protocols 1996 Evidence-Based Child Health: A Cochrane Review Journal 2012 International Journal of Preventive, Curative & Community Medicine CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne 2016 Vaccine injections can cause acute pain and distress in infants, which can contribute to dissatisfaction with the vaccination experience and vaccine hesitancy. We sought to compare the effectiveness of additive pain interventions administered consistently during vaccine injections in the first year of life. We conducted a multicentre, longitudinal, double-blind, add-on, randomized controlled trial. Healthy infants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 levels of pain management for all vaccine injections at 2, 4, 6 and 12 months: (i) placebo control; (ii) parent-directed video education about infant soothing; (iii) the video plus sucrose administered orally or (iv) the video plus sucrose plus liposomal lidocaine applied topically. All infants benefit from injection techniques that minimize pain. We used a double-dummy design; hence all parents watched a video (active psychological intervention or placebo) and all infants received oral solution (sucrose or placebo) and topical cream (lidoc...
