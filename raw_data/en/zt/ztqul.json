Concurrently, nanomedicine has revolutionized the way we fight diseases with unique physical properties and distinct mechanisms of action. In particular, cell membrane -coated xiv nanoparticles , which are biomimetic nanotherapeutics derived from natural plasma cell membrane, have demonstrated tremendous benefits in cancer immunotherapy. Herein, the first chapter of this dissertation will be dedicated to the design principles and current status of cancer cell membrane- coated nanoparticles for anticancer vaccinat ion. The second chapter of the dissertation will focus on the design, fabrication, and biological functions of a biomimetic anticancer vaccine that can co -deliver tumor antigens and immunostimulatory adjuvants. This nanovaccine utilizes natural cancer cell membrane to provide multivalent- antigen specificity, drains efficiently to lymphatic system to engage immune cells, and elicits a strong immune response to control tumor growth in both prophylactic and therapeutic settings. The third chapter of the disser tation will focus on the design, fabrication, and biological functions of a biomimetic nanoparticle platform that can be used to mobilize specific T cell subsets without the need for professional antigen- presenting cells. This nanoparticle utilizes enginee red cancer cell membrane that express a T cell co -stimulatory marker and present peptide epitopes, the two signals necessary to promote tumor antigen- specific T cell immune responses. These two platforms both represent powerful tools that can be used to de velop personalized cancer immunotherapies down the road . This dissertation will serve as a paradigm to rationally design both natural and engineered cancer cell membrane coated nanoparticles for antitumor immunotherapy. By harnessing the amply available en gineering tools, researchers could enhance the functionalities of cell membrane beyond the natural properties of parent cells, and significantly expand the application of cell membrane- coated nanoparticles beyond antitumor immunotherapy. 1 Chapter 1 Introduction 2 1.1 Introduction Our immune system is a complex network of cells, proteins, and physical barriers that work together to keep the human body free from disease. When mobilized correctly, it has the ability to seek out and eliminate foreign invaders with exquisite specificity. Malfunctioning or underperforming immunity is often the root cause of many disease states. For example, an overactive immune system can result in autoimmunity, which is characterized by proinflammatory states and leads to the destruction of healthy tissue [1, 2 ]. On the other hand, an underactive immune system can lead to enhanced susceptibility to infection, which is becoming increasingly dangerous given the rise of anti biotic resistance [3]. With regards to tumorigenesis, it has been shown that the immune system is integral in helping to prevent the proliferation of ma lignant cells [4]. It is now known that for tumors to successfully grow, cancerous cells must generally go through a prolonge d evolutionary process in order to develop mechanisms for immune evasion [5]. Tumors can manipulate the surrounding microenvironment to support growth and suppress host immune responses using cytokine and growth factor secretion [6], extracellular matrix restructuring [7], and cellular signaling [8, 9] . It is for this reason that an intense amount of research has been focused on leveraging the immune system to fight off cancer [10]. In general, cancer immunotherapies seek to train, augment, or supplement the body's own ability to eliminate malignant growths. There are numerous classes of immunotherapy, and they can act on different stages of immunity, ranging from initi al antigen presentation up to the final effector stages [11, 12]. Depending on the specific type of cancer being treated, early returns have thus far been promising, and a number of immunotherapies have proven to be highly potent in scena rios where the previous clinical standard of care had little effect [13-15]. 3 Anticancer vaccination is a class of cancer immunotherapy that focuses largely on training the immune system to recognize and mount a response against tumors in an antigenspecific manner [12, 16] . Over the course of recent human history, vaccines have represented an attractive means of managing the spread of disease, as most are easy to administer and can promote the development of sterilizing immunity [17]. Particularly in the case infectious diseases, vaccination has proven to be highly effective, having likely helped to prevent millions of deaths as a result of largescale prophylaxis campaigns [18]. Despite the favorable history of antibact erial and antiviral vaccines, anticancer vaccination unfortunately has not achieved the same level of success [19, 20] . Unlike with those against pathogens, there are additional hurdles that must be overcome in order for vaccines against tumors to be effective. One of the main challenges comes from the fact that most tumors are lowly immunogen ic and originate from one's own healthy cells. As such, it is incredibly difficult for the immune system to correctly identify malignant tissue. Additionally, vaccines against established tumors must be administered therapeutically, requiring the need for formulations that are highly potent in addition to being tumorspecific. This has oftentimes necessitated the use of complex strategies for immune system manipulation [19-21], many of which are lowly viable in a clinical setting given poor costtobenefit ratios. In 2010, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved the first and only therapeutic anticancer vaccine, sipuleucelT [22]. This autologous cellbased therapy trains patientderived immune cells against a common prostate cancer antigen before reinfusion of the cells back into the patient. The treatment has been shown to marginally increase patient survival time, but the complex logistics and high cost of manufacturing a personalized cellbased vaccine have limited its commercial viability. To address the hurdles faced by traditional vaccination schemes against cancer, many researchers have turned toward nanotechnology to help guide the design of nanovaccines capable 4 of producing potent, specific, and durable antitumor responses [23, 24] . Compared with traditional vaccines, those manufactured at the nanoscale have unique physical and material properties that make them better suited for immune manipulation. Through purposeful engineering, nanovaccines can be formulated with antigen and adjuvant payl oads in a manner that maximizes immune responses through efficient delivery to specific cellular subsets. Ultimately, the goal is to leverage such platforms for the controlled programing of endogenous immunity to reverse tumor burden. In this review, we st art by covering some basic background information regarding anticancer vaccines and the current state of traditional platforms. We then discuss developments in the field of anticancer nanovaccines, focusing on platforms for both nonspecific and antigenspe cific immune modulation. Finally, we introduce an emerging class of biomimetic nanoparticles based on cell membrane coating nanotechnology. This topdown strategy directly leverages nature's own design principles as a means of fabricating multifunctional a nd multiantigenic nanosystems, which have the potential to play an important role in the future of anticancer vaccination. 1.2 Background on Anticancer Vaccination 1.2.1 Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy Cancer is generally characterized by an accumulation of mutations that allows for uncontrolled cell proliferation. As tumors grow, they are in a constant battle with the immune system and must evolve mechanisms for escape over time [5]. Due to the random nature of the mutations that lead to malignancy, phenotypes can vary greatly among different cancers, as well as among cells within the same tumor. This heterogeneity not only serves as a challenge for 5 traditional cancer therapeutics, but also acts as an im mune evasion mechanism, increasing the likelihood of some mutant cell populations remaining undetected [20, 25] . Another immune escape mechanism occurs through antigen shedding [26]. As part of their normal growth, cells generate a large amount of was te products, and these unwanted products are commonly secreted through membrane vesicles. When released in large abundance, this process can also deplete the parent cell of tumorspecific antigens, thus enabling the altered cancer cells to avoid destruction by cytotoxic T cells. Furthermore, shed antigens released into the bloodstream can act as decoys for neutralizing cancerspecific antibodies. Solid tumors can employ additional means of escape, whereby their local microenvironments are remodeled to promote immune toleranc e [27]. A better understanding of how cancer interacts with the immune system has allowed for the development of new and effective therapeutics. The goal of cancer immunotherapies is to leverage a patient's own immune system to eradicate tumors in a highly specific and relatively safe manner [28]. One example is through an overall activation of the immune system by administering proinflammatory cytokines, which are immunomodulatory molecules released by activated immune cells [29, 30] . Although the immune stimulation caused by these molecules is nonspecific, an overall boost in immunity ca n sometimes strengthen immune cells enough to overcome tumor suppression. More specific, tumortargeted approaches can be achieved using genetically engineered chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) on T cells [31, 32] . In CAR T cell therapy, T lymphocytes are isolated from a patient or a donor through leukapheresis [33]. The cells are then genetically modified to express a receptor that can recognize tumorassociated antigens, leading to elimination of the corresponding cells. Altered T cells are purified, expanded ex vivo , and finally infused back into patients for treatment. For some cancer types, this CAR approach has displayed striking efficacy in the clinic. 6 Antibodies have also been widely used to elicit antitumor immunity. For example, tumor targeted monoclonal antibodies that recognize tumor antigens can opsonize cancer cells trigger antibodydependent, thes e cytotoxic cargos can be more accurately targeted to the tumor site and induce immunogenic cell death [35]. More recently, antibodybased checkpoint inhibitors have been used to directly modulate the function of specific immune cell subsets [36]. Immune checkpoints involve inhibitory receptors such as programed cell death protein 1 (PD1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte -associated protein 4 (CTLA4) that regulate T cells. By presenting the corresponding ligands, the cytotoxic activity of T cells can be inhibited by tumor cells and regulatory immune cells. In checkpoint blockade therapy, antibodies target and block these receptor binding sites, thus removing the inhibitory signals on the T lym phocytes and unleashing their full potential for eliminating cancer cells. Despite their ability to elicit strong antitumor responses, efficacy of checkpoint blockades can vary greatly by patient [37]. This discrepancy may be explained by the fact that the therapy generally relies on the presence of preexisting tumortargeted T cells [38] . For this reason, checkpoint blockades are being actively explored for use in combination with other therapies such as anticancer vaccination, which can help to generate new T cell populations [39, 40] . 1.2.2 Current State of Cancer Vaccines Cancer vaccines introduce tumorrelevant antigenic material in a manner that leads to downstream mobilization of the immune system [28]. As the most immunogenic mutations have likely already been selected out by the time cancer is detected [5], the presence of tumor antigens 7 alone is usually not sufficient to drive proper immune stimulation. As such, tumor antigens are almost always combined with an adjuvant in order to enhance the immune response [41]. In the basic process, delivered antigens are taken up by professional antigenpresenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells, which process and break down the antigens, followed by presentation of the peptide fragments via major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) [42] . With the help of the adjuvant, the APCs mature, enabling engagement and activation of cancerrelevant T cells. Finally, the activated T cells can help to promote tumor elimination, either by further propagating immune activation or by directly seeking out and destroying the cancer cell s. Antigenic delivery to the immune system can be achieved in multiple ways. The most straightforward is the direct administration of tumor antigens. In singleantigen approaches, a tumor antigen overexpressed on cancer cells is administered parenterally [43]. This has been shown to eli cit a robust immune response against the target antigen, especially in combination with an adjuvant; however, this approach may ultimately be thwarted by tumor heterogeneity. Whole cell preparations are another source of antigenic material that can theoret ically be used to vaccinate against the full breadth of tumor antigens [44]. However, this strategy often suffers from inadequate antitumor immune responses due to the interference from irrelevant proteins. In response to the often weak immunity generate d by the above approaches, dendritic cells can be pulsed with an antigen and stimulated ex vivo [21]. Once this process is completed, the cells are then injected back into the patient in a process similar to CAR T cell therapy. The manipulated dendritic cells can subsequently migrate to the body's immune centers, where they train endogenous T cells. In a final method, antigenic uptake can happen in situ at the tumor site, taking advantage of processes such as immunogenic cell death, which provide autologous tumor antigens 8 under an immunostimulatory cont ext [45]. In situ vaccinations can also be achieved with oncolytic viruses that selectively infect and destroy cancer cells [46] . In April of 2010, the United States Food and Drug Administration gave its first approval to a therapeutic anticancer vaccine, sipuleucelT, for the treatment of prostate cancer [47] . In this therapy, patientderived dendritic cells are pulsed with prostatic acid phosphatase, which is expressed in a significant numbe r of patients with prostate cancer [48]. After exposure to the antigen, along with granulocytemacrophage colonystimulating factor, the activated dendritic cells are introduced back into the patient. It was demonstrated in a clinical trial that sipuleucelT was able to extend median survival by 4.1 months, which paved the way for its eventual approval [47]. The successful translation of this treatment has motivated the further clinical exploration of anticancer vaccine formulations, and a searc h on ClinicalTrials.gov yields over 200 results for active trials. Examples of current clinical studies include dendritic cell therapies for glioblastoma (NCT01808820), oncolytic viruses for (NCT00408590), peptide vaccines for recurrent glio blastoma (NCT02754362), and whole cell vaccines for breast cancer (NCT00317603). Although cancer vaccines have had some success in the clinic, their limited ability to produce strong antitumor responses has hindered their widespread adoption. Despite its r egulatory approval, the longterm financial viability of sipuleucelT has come into question. The laborintensive processes involved in its manufacture necessitate its high cost, which may be hard to justify given that the treatment only modestly prolongs median survival. Singleantigen peptide vaccines are able to elicit potent immune responses against the tumor cells that display the relevant antigenic epitopes; however, due to the heterogeneity of cancers, antigennegative cells can eventually escape det ection and proliferate without competition [20]. This approach is also not 9 universal, and personalized identification and manufacture of vaccines based on tumorspecific neoantigens may not yet be viable on a large scale [49, 50] . Whole cell vaccination with tumor lysates has the potential to elicit multiantigenic immunity, but the final immune response is often dampened by the presence of extraneous proteins [44]. This underscores the fact that, even when delivering the correct antigenic material, current vaccination strategies may not have sufficient immunostimulatory capacity to overcome the toleroge nic tumor microenvironment. 1.2.3 Advantages of Nanovaccines Nanotechnology offers many opportunities for improving the treatment efficacy of cancer vaccine formulations compared to traditional strategies ( Figure 1.1 ). A major advantage is the ability to formu late the antigen and adjuvant components together in a manner that maximizes immune stimulation [51]. Flexibility in nanoparticle synthesis methods and material choice allows for the incorporation of different classes o f molecules, such as proteins, polysaccharides, nucleic acids, lipids, proteins, and polymers. For example, electrostatic interactions can be used to bind nanoparticles and payloads with opposite charges together [52], or lipidbased cargoes can be incorporated into the an insertion technique [53, 54] b e encapsulated through chemical conjugation [55], or they can be decorated onto the nanoparticle surface [56]. Oftentimes, the nanocarriers themselves can also be fabricated using biologically active vaccine components. For exa mple, it has been demonstrated that both calcium phosphate [57], a mineralbased adjuvant, and certain antigen proteins [58] can be made into nanoparticulate form. 10 Loading of antigen and adjuvant into nanoparticles can serve a variety of purposes. Encapsulation of vaccine components has been shown to increase immunogenicity by protecting the integrity of the molecules from enzymes in the body, such as nucleases, proteases, and phosphatases [59]. Nanoparticulate delivery not only protects the adjuvant from degradation, but can also protect the body from the systemic toxicity of the adjuvants, which can cause side effects such as fever, lethargy, diarrhea, and nausea [60]. Nanoencapsulation can also be used to enhance immune responses by providing extended release properties. Certain gellike or polymeric nanoparticle platforms can act as depots, slowly releasing adjuvants and antigens over a long period of time [61]. Finally, there are a wide range of techniques available for loading both antigens and adjuvants into the same nanocarrier, which has been shown to dramatically increase antigenspecific imm une responses by unifying the pharmacokinetics of the coencapsulated payloads [51] . In terms of payload delivery, nanoparticles can be designed to better target immune cells and immunerich organs. At their size range, nanoparticulate vaccine formulations more easily drain into the lymphatic system after administration, enabling efficient delivery to the lymph nodes [62, 63] , which contain high densities of immune cells. The localization of the nanoparticles can be further improved by modifying their outer layer to display ligands specific to immune cell surface receptors [64, 65] . Nanoformulations can also be des igned to promote intracellular localization in a manner that maximizes the biological activity of the payloads. For example, nucleotidebinding oligomerization domain-like agonists and small interfering RNA (siRNA) can be delivered directly to the cytosol using nanoparticles designed to penetrate through cell membranes [66], and tolllike receptors (TLRs) can be engaged by various agonists when delivered into cells via an endosomal pathway [67]. Overall, carefu l choices in the use of 11 materials, loading methods, and synthesis techniques for nanoparticlebased formulations can all lead to improved vaccine efficacy. Figure 1.1: Advantages of nanoparticles for vaccine design. a) Various combinations of adjuvants and antigens can be formulated using nanoparticle platforms such as liposomes, emulsions, nanogels, and many others. b) Nanovaccines can access the lymphatic drainage system for lymph node delivery while protecting cargoes from environmental degr adation. Once at the lymph nodes, the nanocarriers can deliver their cargoes to antigenpresenting cells (APCs) for immune processing. c) Nanovaccine properties can be tuned to efficiently deliver their cargoes for maximum immune activation. For example, nanoparticles can be modified to target specific subsets of immune cells. They can also be delivered to specific intracellular compartments, where receptors for immune pathways can be triggered. 1.3 Nanoparticle -Based Cancer Vaccines 1.3.1 Nonspecific Modulation Some immunomodulatory nanoparticle platforms work to nonspecifically boost immune system function. While not strictly considered vaccines, these systems do rely on a patient's own tumor as the source of antigenic material and work by augmenting immune processes such as 12 antigen processing and antigen presentation. This is generally achieved by manipulating the immune system in a way that reduces immunosuppression or activates specific immune cell subsets to potentiate a response against cancer cells. In some cases, these formulations can also be combined with tumor cell killing mechanisms to increase exposure to tumorassociated antigens. 1.3.1.1 Enhancing Physical Proximity of Immune Cells An intuitive method for boosting antitumor immune activity is to bring the principal immune cells responsible for tumor elimination closer to their target. To achieve this, nanoparticles can be decorated with two different antibodies, one to target and/or activate immune cells, and another to target the t umor cells. By using these bifunctional nanoparticles, nearby immune cells can be targeted to tumors, increasing the chance of exposure to released tumor antigens or apoptotic cancer cells while enhancing immune stimulation. In a first example, biodegradable poly(lactic acid) nanoparticles were decorated with antibodies against the dendritic cell costimulatory marker CD40, as well as an antibody against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/neu, a common tumor antigen overexpressed in human breast cancer [68]. The antiCD40 antibody was found to both bind and activate dendritic c ells, inducing a strong proinflammatory immune response that could be directed toward neu + tumors. Intratumoral injection of the nanoparticles yielded 100% rejection, while systemic injections resulted in 70% of mice rejecting neu+ tumors. Importantly, rec hallenge of mice that rejected the primary tumor did not lead to any subsequent tumor growth. In another example, polystyrene nanoparticles were conjugated with antibodies against HER2/neu and calreticulin, a protein that facilitates phagocytosis were able to better take up HER2 + cancer cells and presented tumor 13 associated antigens via MHC surface complexes. Intratumoral and intrav enous injections of the nanoparticles led to higher infiltration of CD8+ T cells and inhibited the growth of HER2 expressing tumors. Upon rechallenge, treated mice rejected HER2+ cancer cells but not HER2 cells, demonstrating the specificity of the treatment and the durability of the response. Instead of binding APCs to tumor cells, it has also been demonstrated that antigenspecific T cells can be linked to cancer cells in a similar manner [70]. Conjugation of nanoparticles with SIY - MHC complexes effectively enabled binding to 2C T cells, while the inclusion of antiCD19 allowed for cr osslinking with CD19 + Raji cancer cells. Shortly after intratumoral injection of the nanoparticles, mice were infused with adoptively transferred 2C T cells, which led to significant retardation of tumor growth. 1.3.1.2 Reduction of Immunosuppression The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment is a hurdle for most anticancer immunotherapy treatments, as effector cells can be rendered ineffective by inhibitory proteins or antiinflammatory cytokines. For example, a melanomaspecific peptide vaccine was found to be effective for early stage melanoma, but it failed to demonstrate e fficacy at later disease stages due to increased levels of immunosuppressive cytokines like tumor growth factor (TGF) in the tumor microenvironment [71]. To address this, a liposome -protamine -hyaluronic acid nanoparticle was designed to deliver siRNA against TGF into tumor cells [72]. Injection of the nanoparticles halved the levels of TGF in the tumor microenvironment while doubling the efficacy of the vaccine. This improvement was discovered to be caused by an increase in CD8 + T cells in the late stage tumor tissue along with a mark ed decrease in regulatory T cell levels. Other immunosuppressive efforts focus on the expression of signaling proteins on tumor tissue that 14 interact with immune cells. Wellknown pathways such as PD1 can be intercepted using checkpoint blockades, but syste mic administration can have toxic side effects, potentially leading to the development of autoimmune diseases and pathological inflammation [73]. In one recent work, plateletderived microparticles were used as a carrier for antibodies against programe d deathligand 1 (PDL1) [74]. Afte r tumor resection, residual cancer cells can oftentimes start to regrow the tumor or be released into circulation. These remaining cells can express PDL1 in response to inflammation, making it highly difficult for the immune system to destroy them and prevent tumor recurrence. Due to the abundance of exposed collagen in wound sites, platelet microparticles were chosen as the delivery vehicle for antiPDL1 given their inherent targeting ability. Intravenous injection of the microparticles immediately after incomplete tumor resections was shown to greatly reduce tumor regrowth and metastasis formation in both B16F10 melanoma and triplenegative 4T1 breast cancer mouse models. Similarly, immunotherapy mediated by low dose doxorubicin has been shown to have par tial efficacy against BRaf protooncogene mutant melanoma, but it failed at longterm efficacy likely due to the emergence of the Wnt family member 5a (Wnt5a) protein on cancer cells. Wnt5a can induce dendritic cell tolerance and cause fibrosis of tumor t issue, as well as prevent T cell infiltration. A lipid -protamine -DNA nanoparticle loaded with plasmid DNA encoding for a Wnt5a trap was able to transiently reduce Wnt5a levels in the tumor microenvironment and significantly boost treatment efficacy using doxorubicin [75] . 1.3.1.3 Immune System Activation The immune system can be boosted through the introduction of immunostimulatory payloads, including pathogenassociated molecular patterns (PAMPs), costimulat ory markers, cytokines, and other signaling proteins. Adjuvant administration has been found to be a powerful 15 nonspecific modulator to aid in cancer immunotherapy. PAMPs such as singlestranded DNA, doublestranded RNA, and lipopolysaccharides are recogniz ed by the TLRs found on immune cells and help to promote downstream inflammatory responses. Many of these PAMPs, such as CpG oligonucleotides (ODNs) recognized by endosomal TLR9, have been extensively used as adjuvants in conjunction with a coinjection of proteins or peptides to promote specific immune responses [76-80]. Other TLRtargeted PAMPs such [83] have used in nanoparticle formulations as adjuvants, and some PAMPs have even been coloaded together to simultaneously engage multiple different TLRs [84]. Cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs), small nucleic acids characteristic of invading microbes, are a family of type I interfero n (IFN) -producing PAMPs. These CDNs are in phase I clinical trials, but they require very high dosages to ensure that adequate amounts can get into the cytosol to interact with their stimulator of interferon genes (STING) receptor. Encapsulation of CDNs in to nanoparticles can improve cytosolic delivery and enhance immune responses at lower concentrations. In one work, cyclic diguanylate was encapsulated into polyethylene glycolfunctionalized lipid nanoparticles and used to adjuvant soluble ovalbumin (OVA) protein [85]. After vaccination, a significant increase in both CD8 + and CD4+ T cells was observed, and T cells restimulated with OVA produced fivefold increases in IFN and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Further, a CDNadjuvanted B16F10 vaccine formulation induced a sevenfold higher frequency of gp100specific CD8+ T cells and s ignificantly delayed B16F10 tumor growth. CDNs have also been incorporated into nanoparticles consisting of cationic poly(amino ester) (PBAE), a polymer widely used for cytosolic of DNA [86]. Delivery of cyclic diguanylate to THP 1 cells using a PBAE carrier yielded an equivalent amount of IFN regulatory factor 3 activation as free CDN, but at a 100fold lower dose of adjuvant. When the nanoparticles were given as an 16 intratumoral injection along with antiPD1 antibodies, complete remission of B16F10 tumors was seen at an order of magnitude lower CDN dosage than the soluble form. The repetitive protein structure of viral capsids selfassembled into nanoparticles can also serve as a PAMP. For example, cowpea mosaic virus is a noninfectious selfassembles into hollow, icos ahedral which 1.2) increased tumorinfiltrating neutrophils, activated neutrophils the lung microenvironment, and elevated levels of neutrophilsecreted cytokines. Significantly delayed tumor growth was seen after injections of the nanoparticles via various routes in multiple different tumor models. In particular, the viruslike particles were able to eliminate primary B16F10 tumors in half of mice upon intratumoral injection, as well as provide longterm antitumor immunity as shown by rejection of a contralateral B16F10 rechallenge. Other viruslike particles such as the papaya mosaic virus [89], influenza virus [90], and tomato yellow leaf curl virus [91] have also shown strong adjuvanting properties that can be taken advantage of for immune modulation. 17 Figure 1.2: Viruslike nanoparticles for in situ anticancer vaccination. a) Schematic depicting the synthesis of empty cowpea mosaic virus (eCPMV ) nanoparticles and their expected mechanism of action for tumor treatment. b,c) When used to treat tumorbearing mice, viruslike nanoparticles significantly enhanced survival in both a 4T1luc metastatic breast cancer model (b) and an ID8Def29/VegfA ovarian cancer model (c).

For instance, mast cells can influence dendritic cel l migration to the lymph nodes and upregulate inflammatory responses through the release of granules full of immune mediators like TNF. To mimic this natural boosting of the immune system, synthetic mast cell granules were synthesized by trapping TNF into a nanoparticle matrix of chitosan-heparin [92]. Like real mast cell granules, the particles drained to lymph nodes and promoted germinal center formation. Due to the modular nature of the nanoparticles, TNF could be replaced with interleukin12 (IL12) to promote polarization of immune cells toward proinflammatory phenotypes, such as IFNsecreting T cells. Delivery of IL2, a crucial cytokine for T cell survival 18 and proliferation, has also been explored as a method to enhance T cell -mediated immunotherapy. Hydroxyethyl starch nanocapsules wer e coupled with IL2 using copperfree click chemistry, and incubation with T cells resulted in a high level of uptake and a fourfold increase in division index compared to unmodified nanocapsules. It has been shown previously that nanoparticles delivering a combination of different classes of immuneactivating adjuvants can promote increased therapeutic efficacy [93]. Combinations of cytokines with other molecules, such as PAMPs [94] and costimulatory ligands [95], have also been shown to synergistically ac tivate immune cells. 1.3.1.4 Immune Activation and Immunosuppressive Intervention Combination Beyond combining different methods of activating immune cells, simultaneous use of immunosuppressive intervention and immune activation can also yield impressive results . For example, combining IL10 siRNA and CpG ODN into a pathogenmimicking nanoparticle resulted in a balanced Th1/Th2 cytokine response that improved antitumor efficacy [96]. Immune activating R848 has also been delivered to T cells by encapsulation in nanoparticles that were targeted to T cells expressing PD1 [97]. To enhance costimulation while reducing immunosuppression, dualtargeted nanoparticles have been developed with both agonistic and antagonistic antibodies conjugated onto the same surface. In one case, anti41BB was attached onto particles to activate the 41BB costimulation pathway on CD8 + T cells, while the conjugation of antiPDL1 served to block PDL1 expressed on the surface of cancer cells [98]. Alternatively, nanoparticles decorated with antiOX40 and antiPD1 were able to target T cells expressing both receptors, simultaneously activating them and prevent ing their anergy [99]. In both the cases 19 above, T cells were less inhibited by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, leading to enhanced antitumor efficacy in a variety of mouse cancer models. 1.3.1.5 Combination with Traditional Anticancer Therapies In the examples discussed thus far, it can be understood that the immunostimulatory nanoparticle platforms relied on the natural immune processing of tumor cells as the source of antigenic material. To facilitate the generation of tumor antigens and downstream immune activation, another strategy is to actively promote the release of materi al from tumors while concurrently introducing nonspecific immune modulators. For example, administration of the immunotherapeutic potato virus X alone caused a modest decrease in the growth rate of B16F10 cancer cells, similar to monotherapy with doxorubi cin. However, coadministration of both the components led to a significant improvement in antitumor efficacy [100] . In another w ork, cytotoxic cationic silica nanoparticles were used to induce necrotic cell death while delivering a STING agonist to the immune cells in the tumor microenvironment [101] . Finally, \"sticky\" nanoparticles were designed to capture antigens in situ before being phagocytosed by immune cells [102] . After administration of an tiPD1 antibodies, primary tumors were irradiated and then injected with the antigencapturing nanoparticles. Taking advantage of the abscopal effect, proteinloaded nanoparticles could then travel to the lymph nodes to facilitate an adaptive immune response, which led to the eventual destruction of a secondary tumor in 20% of mice. 20 1.3.2 Specific Modulation The ultimate goal of vaccination is to stimulate the immune system while simultaneously guiding a specific response against the desired target. For cancer immunotherapy, this target is often a lowly immunogenic antigen that is differentially expressed by t umor cells. As a result, an ideal cancer vaccine requires delivery of the relevant antigens along with a potent immunological adjuvant, which can be used to force the immune system to mount an antitumor response. In recent research, nanotechnology has been employed to further improve the efficacy of cancer vaccines using several strategies, including inherent nanoparticle adjuvancy, codelivery of antigen and adjuvant, targeted delivery to immune cells, enhanced immune cell uptake and crosspresentation, and cytosolic delivery. 1.3.2.1 Inherent Nanoparticle Adjuvancy There is a wide variety of materials and structures that can be made into nanoparticles, and one strategy for the formulation of nanovaccines is to carefully choose a material that is naturally immunost imulatory. This can help to streamline nanoparticle fabrication by reducing the complexity of the final formulation. As an example, nanoparticles made of viral capsids naturally activate the immune system, largely due to the conservation of repetitive prot ein structures or the retention of nucleic acidbased PAMPs. These viruslike particles can engage TLRs in immune cells while delivering an antigenic payload. Even very lowly immunogenic tumor -associated antigens like idiotypic immunoglobulin from B cell l ymphomas can elicit a strong humoral response when delivered by nanoparticles made of potato virus X coat proteins [103] . Other gel like nanoparticles can be made by crosslinking materials that mimic the structure of PAMPs, such hydrophobic encapsulating antigens. dtetrapeptide hydrogels in particular show promise as a vaccine adjuvant. Nanoformulations made by mixing irradiated tumor cells with a selfassembling hydrogel made of the d configuration of naphthylacetic acidmodified GFFY peptide were able to significantly protect mice from both E.G7 and 4T1 tumor challenges [108] . Immune responses to antigens can also be naturally boosted by carefully tuning their release over time. Nanogels are especially adept at this, as proteintopolymer ratios can be precisely varied to change matrix spacing and cargo release rates [109, 110] . Some formulations have shown impressive sustained protein release, such as a PBAE layerbylayer microparticle that extended release halflife from [111] , or a hyaluronic acidbased nanogel that released proteins for over one week in rats [112] . Antigen delivery can be further improved by modifying nanogels to be retained at the immunization site, promoting sustained release of the payload in the presence of immune cell s [113] . Polymeric nanoparticles can also provide sustained prote in release profiles, as in the case of a poly(lactic coglycolic acid) (PLGA)based formulation that was shown to release OVA protein for over a week [114] . When modified to carry gp100 or B16F10 lysate, the same particles could produce approximately threefold greater T cell activation compared to equivalent doses of prot ein in soluble form, and this resulted in superior B16F10 tumor suppression. 1.3.2.2 Codelivery of Antigen and Adjuvant In general, delivery of antigens alone is not enough to trigger a strong immune response, requiring the use of an adjuvant to boost immune act ivation. For example, OVA antigen conjugated to poly(propylene sulfide) nanoparticles showed no antiOVA immune response in 22 mice, but high levels of dendritic cell maturation and OVAspecific T cell generation were observed when the same particles were del ivered along with an administration of CpG, resulting in protection against influenza -OVA challenge [115] . Furthermore, vaccines generally work the best when the antigen and adjuvant are delivered concurrently to the same APC, which can be readily accomplishe d using nanoparticlebased systems. This idea was shown systematically with a model cancer vaccine consisting of a polymeric nanoparticle loaded with an OVA peptide and the TLR7/8 agonist R848 [116] payloads resulte d in higher antiOVA IgG production compared to either component in free form, one component in free form and the other encapsulated, or both the components encapsulated separately. In addition, codelivery of both the components together enhanced downstrea m T cell - mediated lysis of OVAexpressing cells and elicited increased local cytokine production. Many platforms have been designed for the codelivery of antigen and adjuvant together, including interbilayercrosslinked multilamellar vesicles loaded with OVA antigen inside and MPLA interspersed throughout their lipid bilayers [117] . Immunization with this formulation led to an impressive 28% of CD8 + T cells exhibiting OVA specificity, which was 14 times greater than observed when using soluble OVA and MPLA. These specific T cells also retained their functionality, as shown by high IF N production upon restimulation with OVA ex vivo . When vaccinating against a heterogenous target like cancer cells, multiepitope vaccine formulations can be employed to prevent immune escape and tumor recurrence [20]. Modular vaccine designs, exemplified by recent work describing designer nanodisks [118] , can help overcome this barrier. Synthetic highdensity nanodisks were mixed with cholesterolmodified CpG further functionali zed tumorspecific neoantigens for specificity. Mice immunized with nanodisks harboring a 23 combination of three antigens experienced an expansion in their pool of antigenspecific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells when compared to those receivin g soluble formulations. The multiantigen formulation also showed significantly better control of B16F10 tumor growth compared to single antigen or dualantigen formulations. Impressively, when mice were vaccinated in combination with antiPD1 and antiCTL A4, 90% were cured of their tumor burden. 1.3.2.3 Immune Cell Targeting Due to the easy surface functionalization properties of nanoparticles, the efficacy and efficiency of nanovaccines can be improved by including an immune cell targeting moiety. Vaccine proces sing mainly takes place in APCs, and thus the most common immune cells targeted are dendritic cells and macrophages. A variety of surface markers can be targeted, such as the C type lectin mannose receptor (CD206) by the inclusion of nanovac cine surface [71, 119, 120] . In one example, the targeting ability of mannose was examined, and it was observed that functionalization could increase particle uptake into bone marrow -derived dendritic cells [121] . Strong localized signal of a fluorescently labeled targeted nanovaccine was seen in the draining lymph nodes at 24 h, while particles without mannose started to lose signal as early as 12 h after injection. Other surface markers such as CD11c [122] , scavenger receptor commonly targeted. 1.3.2.4 Efficient Cytosolic Entry Traditional cancer vaccines suffer from difficulty in entering the cytosol of immune cells. Cytosolic entry can help to facilitate the presentation of antigens by MHCI and subsequent 24 mobilization of CD8+ effector T cells. In addition, there are several ma turation pathways and pathogen recognition receptors located in the cytosol that can be leveraged to boost the potency of vaccine formulations. As most nanoparticles are taken up endosomally, there exist many strategies for facilitating endosomal escape. D ue to the characteristic acidic environment of the endosomal compartment, redoxresponsive nanovaccines can be used to achieve this goal. For example, some polymeric nanoparticles can act as proton sponges and induce lysosome swelling and rupture when enco low pH environments [126] . Lysosomal rupture -triggered reactive oxygen species have also been shown to enhance proteasome activation, which can help to trigger MHCI antigen presentation [55]. In one case, the common transfection agent, polyethylenimine, was coated onto the surface of antigenloaded polymeric nanoparticles, and this helped to facilitate cross presentation of the loaded antigen after uptake [127] . Similar reducible polymeric systems and cationic dextran nanogels [129] have also shown a similar ability for facilitating MHCI restriction. Besides endosomal escape, there are other ways to enter the cytosol from the endosomal compartment. OVAloaded alumina nanoparticles autophagy, where antigens are diverted into autophagosomes and the delayed antigen degradation allows for increased crosspresentation [130] . By taking advantage of this process, significant levels of OVAspecific T cells could be induced, enabling mice to completel y reject established B16OVA tumors in vivo . In another strategy, nanoparticles can be designed to directly cross cell membranes by incorporating cell penetrating peptides onto their surfaces [131- 133]. Macropinocytosis of lipidcoated nanovaccines has Cytosolic localization gives delivered antigens access to MHCI presentation, but it can also be leveraged to enhance immune stimulation. Recent work has shown that retinoic acid inducible protein 1 ligands and STING ligands may be stronger activators of t he immune system 25 than traditional TLRbased adjuvants like CpG and MPLA [85, 135] . PC7A synthetic nanoparticles have been used to deliver antigen while simultaneously activating the STING pathway ( Figure 1.3) [136, 137] . When loaded with OVA, the nanoformulation induced a threefold increase in antigen crosspresentation due to endosomal disruption by the redoxresponsive PC7A. Once in the cytosol, the PC7A also engaged the STING receptor, resulting in higher immune activation compared to poly(I:C) or other polymeric nanoparticle groups. The combination of potent STING activation and efficient antigen crosspresentation led to significant antitumor efficacy against loaded antigens in B16OVA, B16F10, MC38, and TC1 mouse tumor models. Figure 1.3: Synthetic nanoparticles activating the STING pathway for antitumor vaccination. a) Sc hematic depicting an antigenloaded synthetic nanocarrier (PC7A) and its proposed mechanism of action. b,c) When used to treat tumorbearing mice, antigenloaded PC7A nanoparticles significantly enhanced survival in both a B16F10 melanoma model (b) and an MC38 colon cancer model (c). Reproduced with permission. Copyright 2017, Springer Nature. Instead of delivering antigens directly to the cytosol, some recent work has also focused on delivery of antigenencoding RNA for in situ transcription and antigen production [120, 134, 138]. Aciddissolvable calcium phosphate nanoparticles carrying messenger RNA (mRNA) 26 encoding the tumorassociated tyrosinaserelated protein 2 (TRP2) could elicit stronger antigen specific T cell respo nses and humoral responses against B16F10 [120] . In could be delivered to downregulate PDL1 in dendritic cells to reduce immunosuppression. Cytosolic delivery of both the mRNAs was shown to have a potent antitumor effect, significantly better than cytosolic delivery of either component alone. This strategy of RNA antigen sourcing has also been implemented using a highly modular RNA-lipoplex platform [134] . RNAcontaining lipoplexes were optimized to target the spleen by modifying the charge ratios of the components, and the resulting formulation was shown to be taken up into the cytoplasm of dendritic cells and macrophages via macropinocytosis. The induced of APCs. tion of antigenencoding RNA induced generation of functional antigenspecific T cells and memory cells, which resulted in potent antitumor efficacy in several tumor models. Moving toward clinical translation, three human patients with advanced malignant melanoma received five doses of the nanovaccine encoding for four tumor antigens. All three patients showed systemic IFN production, along with de novo priming and amplification of T cells against the vaccine antigens. 1.3.2.5 Artificial Antigen Presentation Most cancer vaccines work by manipulating APCs, which can then further stimulate antigenspecific T cells and B cells. Recently, there has been significant interest in developing artificial APCs (aAPCs) that are capable of directly stimulating effector cells [139] . This strategy was originally developed in order to effectively expand T cells ex vivo for adoptive cell therapies such as CAR T cell therapy [140] . These aAPCs, which include both live cell -based and synthetic 27 micro/nanoparticlebased platforms, mimic professional APCs and can strongly activate T cells while avoiding the intensive labor, high cost, and difficulty in quality control when using autologous APCs. Similar to their natural counterparts, aAPCs require at least two signals to induce T cell activation. The first signal, a peptide -MHC complex, binds to its cognate T cell receptor (TCR) and establishes antigen specificity. To become fully activated, T cells require a second signal in the form of costimulatory molecules such as CD80 and CD86, which engage their corresponding receptor on the T cell surface [139] . With these two signals, aAPCs have the potential to act as a vaccinelike platform that can expand antigenspecific T cell populations, but without the use of immunological adjuvants. In addi tion to the minimum two signal requirement, at times a third signal, in the form of soluble cytokines, can further enhance the survivability of the activated T cells [141] . To generate nanoscale aAPCs capable of engaging and activating T cells, MHC -Ig along with a costimulatory signal, in the form of CD80 or antiCD28, has been decorated onto the surface of nanoparticles ( Figure 1.4) [142] . compar ed with microscale aAPCs, which largely remained at the injection site. When administered into tumorbearing mice that received adoptively transferred antigenspecific T cells, the nanoparticles were able to help significantly control tumor growth. It has also been demonstrated that aAPCs can be fashioned using magnetic nanomaterials [143] . After incubation with their cognate T cells, these magnetic aAPCs helped to induce signi ficant proliferation and could also guide the T cells to tumors with the use of a magnetic field. In the future, such a platform may be directly used in vivo to promote antitumor activity. Interestingly, it has been found that the shape of nanoscale aAPCs can have a significant impact on their biological activity [144] . Ellipsoid nanoparticles were fabricated by stretching by conjugation w ith antiCD28 MHC loaded with a gp100 tumor antigen epitope. After intravenous injection, it was observed that the ellipsoid particles could induce more antigenspecific T cells in circulation compared with their spherical counterparts. Although the re are currently limited examples of nanoparticulate aAPCs being used in vivo , this nanovaccinelike platform holds significant potential given its ability to help bypass the complicated processes of antigen processing and presentation. Figure 1.4: Quantum dot (QD) nanoparticles for artificial antigen presentation. a) Schematic depicting the artificial antigen presenting cell (aAPC) structure, where both the signals are attached to the nanoparticle surface using biotin- avidin interactions. b) When in jected intravenously into B16 tumor -bearing mice that were also adoptively transferred with antigenspecific T cells, the aAPCs were able to significantly control tumor growth.

More recently, there has been a noticeable paradigm shift within the field of nanomedicine in which a greater emphasis has been placed on biomimetic design principles [145- 148]. Along these lines, a new cell membrane coating approach has emerged in which nanoparticles are cloaked with a layer of cellderived membrane [149- 151]. In contrast to traditional bott omup synthetic strategies, topdown membrane coating directly leverages naturally occurring biological material for the fabrication of multifunctional nanoparticles. Using red blood cells (RBCs) as the source of membrane material, it was demonstrated that RBC membrane -coated nanoparticles gained the ability to avoid immune clearance and circulated for extended periods of time ( Figure 1.5) [152] . The cellmimicking properties of these biomimetic nanoparticles result from the transference of the originating cell's membrane proteins onto the surface of the nanoparticle substrate [153] . This approach for functionalization has proven to be highly generalizable, allowing for the delivery of a wide range of cargoes using different types of m aterials for the inner core [154, 155] . The outer membrane layer can also be modified with further functionality by facile means, affording a dditional flexibility to membranecoated platforms [54, 156] . Since the first work on RBC membrane -coated nanoparticles was reported, research on cell membrane coatings has expanded in multiple directions. In addition to modulating the material 30 Figure 1.5: Functionalization of nanoparticles with a cell membrane coating. Schematic depicting the fabrication of red blood cell (RBC) membrane -coated nanoparticles. RBC vesicles are obtained by hypotonic treatment, followed by coating onto polymeric nanoparticle cores using extrusion.

Copyright 2011, National Academy of Sciences. composition of the inner core, the membrane can be sourced from a plethora of cell types, each resulting in unique formulations with novel properties. For example, platelet membrane -coated nanoparticles exhibit the ability to target bacteria and damaged vasculature [157, 158] , while cancer cell homotypically target cancer cells [159] . White blood cell membrane, with its various toxin and cytokine receptors, has utility for treating sepsis [160] . Other membranecoated formulations have also been reported using stem cell membrane [161] , endothelial cell membrane [162] , and even hybrid membranes generated from multiple cell types [163] . As a result of all the complex functionalities that can be incorporated, this approach has enabled the resulting biomimetic nanoparticles to exc el in nontraditional areas of nanomedicine. A major example is detoxification, where membranecoated particles can act as nanosponges to neutralize toxins by taking advantage of their interactions with cell membranes [164- 166]. By neutralizing these toxins and preventing them from attacking healthy cells, these nanoscale decoys have utility for the treatment of ba cterial infections, animal envenoming, and 31 even exposure to chemical warfare agents. The ability of cell membrane-coated nanoparticles to bind and present multiple antigens, combined with the flexibility of choosing various core materials, has also made th em suitable for vaccine design [23, 24] . 1.4.2 Cell Membrane-Coated Nanoparticles for Antibacterial Vaccination Overall, vaccines represent one of the most efficient methods of reducing the global health burden posed by bacterial infections [167] . Toxoid vaccination represents an effective means of disarming bacteria of their virulent proteins, making it harder for the pathogens to colonize their host. This strategy is currently used in the clinic to vaccinate against tetanus and diphtheria [168] . In order to make bacterial toxins saf e for administration, they are generally inactivated with harsh chemical or heat treatments that can damage antigenicity and reduce vaccination efficacy. By contrast, RBC nanosponges have demonstrated the ability to naturally detain and neutralize bacterial toxins when the two are mixed together, forming what are referred to as nanotoxoids [167, 169] . Using methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and its major virulence factor hemolysin as a model system, the corresponding nanotoxoid was able to generate significant antitoxin titers, improving overall antibacterial immunity compared to a f ormulation [170] . While the control toxoid required 60 min of high heat exposure to achieve an acceptable safety profile, the nanotoxoid demonstrated excellent safety on a number of cell types at the outset. In animal models of both systemic and skin toxin burden, nanotoxoid vaccination on a prime with two boosts schedule resulted in a lmost complete protection. A later study also demonstrated the efficacy of this approach against live MRSA infection [171] . 32 As the mechanism of toxin binding to membranecoated nanoparticles relies on function rather th an the specific structure of the toxin, the nanotoxoid platform can be easily generalized. To generate a multiantigenic nanotoxoid, RBC nanosponges were mixed with a crude hemolytic protein fraction isolated from MRSA culture ( Figure 1.6) [172] . It was confirmed that the nanotoxoids contained several toxins on their surface, including hemolysin, hemolysin, and Panton-Valentine leukocidin. Further, the nanotoxoids w ere found to be completely safe, whereas intense heat treatment of the hemolytic protein fraction could not completely abrogate its toxicity. When used as a vaccine, the multivalent nanotoxoids were capable of generating antibody titers against all of the aforementioned toxins, which helped to reduce bacterial burden upon live MRSA challenge. In addition to the nanotoxoid approach, another method of generating multiantigenic vaccines is to directly employ bacteriaderived membrane. Outer membrane vesicles ( OMVs) are secreted from bacteria and are important in pathogenesis as well as celltocell signaling [173] . Some vaccines employing OMVs as the antigenic material have already been used in the clinic, as is the case with a formulation against meningococcal infection [174] . OMVs are attractive for use as antibacterial vaccines because they often share a similar biochemical membrane profile with their parent cell [175] . The utility of OMVs can be further improved by coating the material around a nanoparticulate core. In one instance, Escherichia coli OMVs were coated onto small gold nanoparticles, which provided increased stability and size control compared with free OMVs [176] . Due to the abil ity to finely control their size, the membranecoated particles efficiently localized to the lymph nodes, leading to strong and durable immune activation. 33 Figure 1.6: Membranecoated nanoparticles for antibacterial vaccination. a) Schematic depicting the nanotoxoid concept, which can be used to develop vaccines against bacteriasecreted toxins. b) Vaccination using multiantigenic nanotoxoids fabricated with a secreted protein (hSP) fraction from methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) significantly inhibited lesion formation caused by subcutaneous MRSA challenge, leading to decreased bacteria counts.

Unfortunately, the same level of clinical success has not been achieved for formulations against cancer. Recently, the extension of cell membrane -coated nanoparticles to anticancer vaccination has become an active area of research. In one example, an RBC membrane- based nanocarrier was designed to deliver a hgp100 tumor antige n peptide and the adjuvant MPLA [177] . The platform was further modified with mannose on the surface to better target dendritic 34 cells, and this led to enhanced localization to the draining lymph nodes. Both prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy were demonstrated in a B16F10 subcutaneous tumor model, resulting in a slowing of tumor growth and a reduction in metastasis. Since cancer cell membranes contain a plethora of autologous tumor antigens, utilizing the purified membrane of cancer cells as the antigenic material can be an effective approach in the design of nanoparticulate anticancer vaccines. This was initially demonstrated nanoparticles incorporated with MPLA [159] . The significantly increased the maturation of bone marrow -derived dendritic cells and enhanced the stimulation of antigenspecific T cells. More recently, an indepth set of studies was conducted using a platform in which cancer c ell membrane was coated around CpG ODN -loaded polymer cores ( Figure agonist in was encapsulated into PLGA cores through a double emulsion process, and B16F10 membrane was coated onto the adjuvantloaded cores by bath sonication. When the formulation was administered subcutaneously into mice, increased maturation of dendritic cells in the draining lymph nodes was observed, a s indicated by the upregulation of protein markers such as CD40, CD80, CD86, and MHCII, when compared to various controls. Notably, CpG encapsulated in nanoparticulate form was able to activate the immune system significantly better than free CpG, likely due to the preferential cellular uptake of the nanoparticles [179-182]. Additionally, it should be noted that TLR9 is located within the endosomal compartment, which highlights the power of leveraging the inherent properties of nanoparticles to purposefully manipulate immune responses. Mice vaccinated with the nanovaccine were able to generate antigenspecif ic CD8 + T cells against gp100 and TRP2, of which are melanomaassociated antigens [183] . When immunized mice were challenged with B16F10 cancer cells, 86% of the mice exhibited no tumor growth, even after 150 days. In a 35 therapeutic setting, it was demonstrated that the nanoformulation, along with a cocktail of anti PD1 and antiCTLA4 checkpoint inhibitors, was able to extend the survival of the tumorbearing mice compared to either treatment alone. Figure 1.7: Membranecoated nanoparticles for anticancer vaccination. a) Schematic depicting the of adjuvantloaded cancer cell membrane -coated nanoparticles (CpG -CCNPs) and their proposed mechanism of action. b,c) When combined with a cocktail of checkpoint blockades (antiCTLA4 and antiPD1), treatment of established B16F10 melanoma with the CpG -CCNP nanovaccine resulted in significantly slowed tumor growth (b) and improved survival (c). Reproduced with permission. Copyright 2017, WileyVCH. Building upon the concept of using cancer cell membrane -coated nanoparticles for antitumor vaccination, various strategies have been employed to augment immune responses. For example, mannose was introduced to bestow immune cell-targeting properties, helping to enhance uptake by dendritic cells and subsequently promoting their maturation [184] . As a result of this additional functionality, the targeted nanovaccine was able to offer better protection for vaccinated mice. It was claimed that this triple combination of an adjuvant, cancer cell membrane antigens, 36 and a targeting ligand could work together to generate a robust anticancer immune response similar to level s generated against bacterial infections. In another example, immune stimulation was enhanced via the concurrent delivery of multiple adjuvants in an artificial cancer cell membrane-coated nanoparticle [185] . CpGencapsulated calcium phosphate cores were fabricated by a water inoil microemulsion process and then coated with a me mbranemimicking liposome layer. Then, OVAexpressing B16F10 cancer cell membrane proteins were purified by dialyzing the membrane against a detergent solution. The membrane proteins, along with the dangerassociated molecular pattern Hsp70, were incorpor ated onto the nanoparticle surface to create the final formulation. This dualadjuvant formulation was able to significantly upregulate maturation markers such as CD80, CD86, and MHCII, and treated mice had fewer lung metastasis compared to formulations w ith just the CpG adjuvant. In all, the works described in this section demonstrate that cell membrane -coated nanoparticles have significant potential to be used as nanovaccines. Armed with the versatility to easily modulate both the adjuvant and the cancer membrane material, which can eventually be derived from a patient's own tumor, this platform may ultimately pave the way for potent, personalized anticancer vaccine therapies. 1.5 Conclusions In this review, we have discussed the progress of using nanotechnology toward the design of cancer vaccines. In theory, vaccination represents an attractive option for cancer therapy, but in practice there are many challenges that need to be overcome in order for such platforms to achieve widespread clinical adoption. G enerally, it is highly difficult for the immune system to generate a potent response against established tumors, which can employ various means to lower their 37 immunogenicity over time. With the help of nanoscale delivery vehicles, researchers are exploring the design of novel vaccine formulations that can elicit immune responses capable of overcoming tumor immunosuppression. Nanocarriers offer many advantages, including the effective localization of payloads to the desired immune cell populations, loading of multiple cargoes into a single nanoparticle, and prolonged release characteristics. More recently, a novel type of biomimetic platform, the cell membrane -coated nanoparticle, has emerged as a strong candidate to drive the further improvement of nanovacci ne platforms. Membrane coating presents a facile means of introducing multiple functionalities onto the same nanoparticle without the need for complicated synthetic techniques. Regarding anticancer vaccination, the use of cancer cell membrane as the coatin g material offers an approach for creating vaccine formulations rich in tumor antigens. Combined with a nanoparticulate core carrying potent immune stimulators and the ability to easily target the resulting nanoparticles to antigen presenting cells, cancer cell membrane -coated nanoparticles can achieve strong inhibition of tumor growth. These nanoformulations may be further improved through the continued optimization of adjuvant and membrane antigen combinations. Methods can also be developed for obtaining membrane material from the resected tumors of patients, enabling the facile fabrication of personalized vaccines. Looking toward clinical translation, a main challenge will be scaling up nanoparticle production in an efficient and costeffective manner. Na noformulations will avoid many expenses required for livecell vaccines, but there will likely need to be a substantial investment of time and resources to adapt current labscale manufacturing procedures to highthroughput workflows capable of production at the scale necessary for human patients. These workflows will also need to align with good manufacturing practices to meet quality requirements for regulatory approval. 38 Finally, significant work will also need to be done on evaluating the synergy between vaccines and other types of cancer therapies. By simultaneously tackling the challenge of cancer treatment on multiple fronts, it may one day be possible to eliminate tumors altogether, regardless of their underlying characteristics.

Despite this fact, an effective anticancer vaccine that is widely applicable and facile to administer, while highly sought after, has continued to remain elusive [4, 5] . Fundamentally, the challenge lies in the need to generate potent and specific immune responses that enable the body to successfully distinguish between healthy and diseased tissue [6]. By the time a neoplastic growth reaches the malignant stage, the most immunogenic tumorspecific antigens have generally been eliminated via negative selection [7, 8] . Some promising strategies under clinical investigation have focused on common t umorassociated antigens, which are dysregulated wild type proteins [9, 10] . However, the applicability of such singleantigen approaches is dependent on tumor phenotype, and they may also be subject to some of the same limitations facing targeted monotherapies as tumors evolve mechanisms of escape [11, 12] . On the other end of the spectrum, whole cell vaccine preparations are capable of delivering a wide range of autologous antigens [13, 14], but they have traditionally been ineffective. This may be a result of significant interference from a surplus of nontumorrelated antigenic material [15] or difficulties in direct administration, which have necessitated more complex cellbased strategies [14, 16, 17] . Additionally, the immunosuppressive microenvironment of established tumors is often hard to break [18, 19] , leading to suboptimal efficacy despite effective training of the immune system. Advances in genomics have enabled the elucidation of individual cancer mutanomes, which can be leveraged to identify multiple vaccine epitopes on a personalized level [20, 21] . Other studies have demonstrated that high mutational burden can lead to neoantigen targets that 56 are recogn ized by the immune system, and this correlates with clinical response to checkpoint blockade therapies [22, 23] . While personalized epitope identification and vaccine manufacture may currently not be practical at largescale, these findings confirm that, despite the challenges facing whole cell formulations, there is a wealth of relevant antigens to be found in autologous tumor material. Applying the principles of biomimetic nanotechnology [24 -26], we explored the presentation of cancerderived membrane material in a context that could enable potent, multiantigenic immune responses for anticancer vaccine design (Figure 2.1). It was demonstrated that nanoparticulate delivery of the membrane, along with an immunostimulatory adjuvant, could facilitate enhanced antigen pr esentation, leading to the activation of tumorspecific cellular responses. Further, when used in conjunction with checkpoint blockade therapy to help break tumor immunosuppression [27 -29], the nanovaccine formulation was able to achieve significant control of tumor growth in a therapeutic setting. Figure 2.1: Schematic of CpGCCNPs for anticancer vaccination. Membrane derived from cancer cells (purple), along with the associated tumor antigens (small colored spheres), is coated onto adjuvantloaded nanoparticle cores (CpGNPs) to yield a nanoparticulate antica ncer vaccine (CpGCCNPs). Upon delivery to antigen presenting cells (blue), the vaccine formulation enables activation of T cells (tan) with multiple specificities. After detecting the antigens present on the tumor, the T cells are capable of initiating cancer cell death (gray). 57 2.2 Experimental Methods 2.2.1 B16-F10 Murine Melanoma Cell Culture and Membrane Derivation B16F10 mouse melanoma cells (CRL6475; American Type Culture Collection) were cultured at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO 2 in T175 tissue culture saline (PBS; Mediatech) by scraping, pelleted at 700 \u00d7 g for 7 min in a Sorvall Legend Micro21R centrifuge, then resuspended in a 50:50 solution of cryopreservation medium (Hyclone) and complete DMEM. Cell aliquots were stor ed at 20 \u00b0C before use. To derive membrane, cells were first washed in a starting buffer containing 30 \u00d7 10 3 m TrisHCl pH 7.0 (Quality Biological) with 0.0759 m sucrose (SigmaAldrich) and 0.225 m Dmannitol (SigmaAldrich), then presence of phosphatase and protease inhibitor 10/35 probe homogenizer at 70% power for 15 passes. Membrane was separated from the resulting homogenate by differential centrifugation using a Beckman Coulter Homogenate was pelleted at 10 000 \u00d7 g for 25 min, and the supernatant was then pelleted at 150 000 \u00d7 g for 35 min. The resulting pellet of cell membrane was washed in 0.2 \u00d7 10 3 m ethylenediaminetetraa cetic acid (EDTA; USB Corporation) in DNase free/RNase free water (Invitrogen) and stored in the same solution at 20 \u00b0C until use. Total membrane protein content was quantified by a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). 58 2.2.2 Cancer Cell Membrane-Coated Nanoparticle Preparation and Characterization Polymeric cores prepared process. PLGA was dissolved in dichloromethane at a concentration of 50 mg mL1. 500 \u00b5L of polymer was added to 100 \u00b5L of 200 \u00d7 103 m TrisHCl pH 8 and sonicated using a Fisher Sci entific 150E Sonic Dismembrator at 70% power pulsed (2 s on/1 s off) for 1 min. An outer aqueous phase consisting of 5 mL of 10 \u00d7 103 m TrisHCl pH 8 was added to the polymer solution and sonicated at the same setting for 2 min. The emulsion was then adde d to 10 mL of 10 \u00d7 103 m TrisHCl pH 8 and magnetically stirred at 700 \u00d7 g for 2.5 h. After stirring, the particles were pelleted at 21 100 \u00d7 g for 8 min, and washed twice in 10 \u00d7 103 m TrisHCl pH 8. Adjuvantloaded polymeric cores (CpGNPs) were made b y including CpG oligodeoxynucleotide 1826 (CpG), synthesized using the sequence 5TCCATGACGTTCCTGACGTT3 with all phosphorothioate bonds (Integrated DNA Technologies), at 500 \u00d7 10 6 m to the inner phase of the double emulsion during nanoparticle synthesis . To optimize the loading, CpGNPs were made with CpG inputs of 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 pmol per 1 mg of PLGA. Each formulation was lyophilized overnight, then resuspended in 1 mL of acetone. PLGA was precipitated and pelleted with the addition of 1 mL wa ter followed by centrifugation at 21 100 \u00d7 g for 20 min. CpG concentration of the supernatants were measured using a QuantiT Oligreen ssDNA quantification kit (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. Further studies employed an initial input of 1000 pmol CpG per 1 mg of PLGA. B16F10 cancer cell membranecoated CpGNPs (CpGCCNPs) were made by pelleting the CpGNP cores and resuspending them in solution containing B16F10 cell membrane. The 59 mixture was sonicated in a 1.5 mL disposable sizing cuvette (Brandtech) using a Fisher Scientific FS30D bath sonicator at a frequency of 42 kHz and a power of 100 W for 2 min. The nanoparticles were washed twice in 10 \u00d7 10 3 m TrisHCl pH 8, and resuspended to a concentration of 25 mg polymer per 1 mL of solution in 5 \u00d7 103 m TrisHCl pH 7.5 and 0.2 \u00d7 103 m EDTA in DNase free/RNase free water for in vitro studies or in 10% sucrose with the same buffer concentrations for in vivo studies. If not used immediately, particles were stored at 20 \u00b0C. In the study, CpG CCNPs were fabricated with 100 \u00b5g of membrane protein per 1 mg of PLGA. Size and surface zeta potential of CCNPs were determined through DLS measurements using a Malvern ZEN 3600 Zetasizer. To test the stability of CCNPs in 10% sucrose solution, part icles were stored at 4 \u00b0C for 2 weeks with size measured by DLS every other day. The morphology of CCNPs was examined by transmission electron microscopy using a Zeiss Libra 120 PLUS EFTEM. Samples were resuspended in 10 \u00d7 10 3 m TrisHCl pH 8, deposited onto a glow discharged carboncoated 400 square mesh copper grid (Electron Microscopy Sciences), and negatively stained with 1 wt% uranyl acetate (Electron Microscopy Sciences). 2.2.3 Membrane Antigen Retention Identification of characteristic B16F10 tumor antigens was completed via western blotting. B16F10 whole cells were collected from culture by scraping, lysed using 0.2% Triton X100 (SigmaAldrich) in lysed B16F10 membrane, and CpGCCNPs were analyzed for pr otein content using a BCA assay, then each diluted to 0.2 mg mL 1 in water. Each sample was then mixed with NuPAGE 4 \u00d7 lithium dodecyl sulfate sample loading buffer (Novex) and heated for 10 min at 70 \u00b0C. 25 \u00b5L of each sample was loaded into 12well Bolt 60 4-12% BisTris gels (Invitrogen) and run at 165 V for 45 min in 3( Nmorpholino)propanesulfonic acid running buffer (Novex). Proteins were transferred to 0.45 \u00b5m nitrocellulose membrane (Pierce) in Bolt transfer buffer (Novex) at 10 V for 60 min. After bloc king with 5% milk (Genesee Scientific) in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (National Scientific), blots were mouse antimouse MART1 (A103; Santa C ruz Biotechnology). The appropriate horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary (Biolegend) was used for secondary staining. Membranes were developed with ECL western blotting substrate (Pierce) in an ImageWorks MiniMedical/90 Developer. 2.2.4 In Vitro Uptake and Activity All animal studies were designed and proceeded in compliance to the University of California, San Diego Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Female C57BL/6NHsd mice were obtained at 6 -10 weeks old from Envigo Harlan. BMDC culture was adapted from a previously published protocol [ 25]. Healthy mice were euthanized using carbon dioxide asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation. Both femurs were dissected, cleaned in 70% ethanol, and cut on both ends. Bone marrow was then flushed out of the bone with a 1 mL sterile syringe using warm BMDC basal media consisting of 500 mL Isocove's Modification of DMEM with 2 \u00d7 10 3 m LGlutamine and 25 \u00d7 103 m 4(2hydroxyethyl)1piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) (Mediatech) supplemented with 50 mL USDA certified fetal bovine serum (Omega Scienti fic), 500 \u00b5L 55 \u00d7 103 m (Gibco), 5 mL 200 \u00d7 103 m LGlutamine (Gibco), and 5 mL penicillinstreptomycin. Cells were then pelleted at 700 \u00d7 g for 5 min, 61 resuspended in BMDC growth media, consisting of the basal media further supplemented with 10 ng mL1 granulocyte/macrophagecolony stimulating factor (GMCSF; Biolegend), to a concentration of 1 \u00d7 106 cells mL1, and plated into petri plates at 2 \u00d7 106 cells per plate. On the third day of culture, 10 mL of BMDC growth media was added to e ach plate. To make CpGCCNPs with fluorescently labeled polymeric cores, 644/663 nm; added to the PLGA solution at 0.1 wt% of the polymer dur ing nanoparticle synthesis. For the nanoparticle uptake study, BMDCs were collected on day 5 using 1 \u00d7 103 mEDTA in PBS. Cells were washed once in PBS, resuspended in BMDC basal media, and plated into 24well suspension plates. DiDlabeled CpGCCNPs were added at a final concentration of 1.4 mg mL1. At each timepoint (0, 15, 30 min, 1, 2, 6, 12, 24 h), media was removed, and the cells were detached with trypsinEDTA (Gibco). Cells were collected, washed once in trypsinEDTA, washed twice in PBS, and resus pended in 200 \u00b5L of 10% phosphate buffered formalin (Fisher). The adjuvant uptake study was conducted similarly, instead employing CpGCCNPs synthesized with CpG containing a 5 6FAM modification (Integrated DNA Technologies). Free dyelabeled CpG was use d at an equivalent concentration for comparison. For all experiments, after each time point was collected and processed, 1 drop of NucBlue Live ReadyProbe Reagent UV stain (Molecular Probes) was added and data were collected using a Becton Dickinson FacsCa ntoII flow cytometer. All data were analyzed using FlowJo software. The activity of delivered CpG was examined using a BMDC cytokine release assay. BMDCs were plated on day 6 into 96well plates at a concentration of 8 \u00d7 10 4 cells mL1 in BMDC growth media. Dilutions of CpGCCNP or free CpG were added to the cells. After 2 h of incubation, the cells were washed three times with fresh BMDC growth media and cultured for 62 another 2 d. Supernatant was then collected and measured for the pres ence of proinflammatory cytokines using mouse IL6 and IL12p40 ELISA kits (Biolegend) according to manufacturer's instructions. Antigen and adjuvant colocalization by imaging BMDCs incubated ester (Biotium) and used to coat CpGCCNPs fabricated with FAMmodified CpG. BMDCs were seeded into 8well chamber slides at 7.5 \u00d7 10 4 cells mL1 and incubated with the nanoparticles for 15 min at 0.7 mg mL1. Cells we re then washed three times with PBS, fixed with 10% formalin for 30 min, then washed again three times with PBS and mounted onto coverslips using VECTASHIELD mounting media with DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Samples were imaged on a Deltavision RT Deconvolut ion Microscope at 60 \u00d7 magnification. 2.2.5 In Vivo Cellular Localization and Dendritic Cell Activation To assess in vivo localization, DiDlabeled CpGCCNPs were injected subcutaneously into each hock of female C57BL/6NHsd mice. After 24 h, the popliteal lymph nodes were collected into 500 \u00b5L of dissociation buffer consisting of 1 mg mL1 collagenase D from Clostridium histolyticum (Roche) and 1 mg mL1DNase I grade II, from bovine pancreas (Roche) in Dulbecco's PBS with calcium and magnesium (Gi bco). Lymph nodes were dissociated manually by pipetting and then were stained with 63 isotypes (Biolegend) were used for gating purposes with cells from an untreated lymph node. After washing, dead cells were labeled with propidium iodide (Biolegend). Data were collected using a Becton flow cytometer and analyzed using FlowJo activation following immunization with CpGCCNPs , CpGNPs, CCNPs, or additional controls was determined by testing dendritic cell maturation and lymph node cytokine secretion. To test vaccines with antigens and adjuvants delivered as separate components, additional controls of CCNP with free CpG and B16F10 whole lysate with free CpG were also administered. The CCNPs with free CpG formulation was made by mixing the two components such that the final ratio was 25 mg of PLGA per 3.5 nmol of CpG. Whole cell lysate was prepared by three freezethaw cycles at 80 \u00b0C for 10 min followed by 10 min at 37 \u00b0C. The amount of protein used for the formulation was normalized by the amount of Na +K+ATPase, a characteristic membrane protein, compared with CCNPs as determined by immunoblotting. To examine dendritic cell maturation in vivo , 50 \u00b5L of each formulation at 25 mg mL 1 of nanoparticle, or equivalent, was injected into the hock. After 24 h, the popliteal lymph nodes of all treated mice were collected into 500 \u00b5L dissociation buffer and manually dissociated. Cells were were us ed for gating purposes with cells from an untreated lymph node. After 30 min of incubation at 4 \u00b0C, the cells were washed and stained with CellTrace Calcein Violet, AM (Molecular Probes) in PBS according to manufacturer's instructions. Data were collected using a Becton Dickinson FACSCantoII flow cytometer and analyzed using FlowJo software. To analyze cytokine production, lymph nodederived single cell suspensions were plated with 500 \u00b5L of BMDC growth media in 24well tissue culture plates. 64 After 48 h, s upernatant was collected and analyzed for cytokine content using IL6 and IL12p40 ELISA kits according to the manufacturer's instructions. 2.2.6 Adoptive T Cell Proliferation and Native T Cell Generation B6.CgThy1a/Cy Tg(TcraTcrb)8Rest/J (pmel1) transgenic mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory at 4- 6 weeks old. The spleen, popliteal lymph node, and inguinal lymph nodes of one pmel1 mouse were collected for dissociation into single cell suspensions. The red blood cells in the spleen were removed using lysis buffer (Biolegend), and all remaining cells were pooled together. CD8+ T cells were separated out using CD8a (Ly2) microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) on Miltenyi Biotec MACS LS separation columns per manufacturer's instructions. After separation, cells were washed in PBS and stained with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE; eBiosciences). Cells were then diluted to 2.5 \u00d7 10 6 cells mL1 and 200 \u00b5L was transferred to na\u00efve C57BL/6NHsd recipients. 2 h postinjection, each mouse was inject ed with 50 \u00b5L of various vaccine formulations in both hocks. 4 d after treatment, the spleens were collected and dissociated into single cell suspensions. Adoptively transferred T cells were stained for using allophycocyanin cytometer and analyzed using FlowJo software. CFSE dilution was used to assess the degree of T cell prolifer ation. To assess the native generation of antigenspecific T cells, C57BL/6NHsd mice were vaccinated subcutaneously with 50 \u00b5L of the different formulations in each hock on days 0, 2, and 4. On day 10, spleens were collected and processed into single cell suspensions using mechanical 65 dissociation. After lysing the red blood cells, 5 \u00d7 106 splenocytes were plated into 6well suspension plates and pulsed with either 1 \u00b5g mL1 of mouse SVYDFFVWL (Anaspec) in BMDC growth media. After 7 d, cells were collected, washed in PBS, and stained with APC FACSCantoII flow cytometer and analyzed using FlowJo software. 2.2.7 In Vivo Immunity and Therapeutic Efficacy To study the protection conferred by vaccination, C57BL/6NHsd mice were vaccinated with 50 \u00b5L of the different formulations at 25 mg mL1 of PLGA, or equivalent, on days 0, 7, and 14. On day 20, the right flank of each mouse was shaved and, on day 21, mice were challenged with 2 \u00d7 10 5 B16F10 cells subcutaneously on the right flank. Tumors were measured every other day and the experimental endpoint was defined as either death or tumor size greater than 200 mm2. To study the antitumor therapeutic effect, C57BL/6NHsd mice were first challenged on the right flank with 5 \u00d7 104 B16 F10 cells on day 0. On days 1, 2, 4, and 7, mice were vaccinated subcutaneously in the same flank with 200 \u00b5L of the nanoparticulate formulations. The subcutaneous route was chosen in this case to accommodate the larger dosage that was employed. The checkp oint blockade cocktail, consisting of administered intraperitoneally on the same days. Tumors were measured every other day and the experimental endpoint was defined as either death or tumor size greater than 200 mm 2. 66 2.3 Results and Discussion CpG oligodeoxynucleotide 1826 (CpG), a nucleic acidbased immunological adjuvant known to trigger the maturation of antigen presenting cells, was encapsulated into biodegradable poly(lactic coglycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticle cores via a double emulsion process ( Figure 2.2a). The amount of CpG that could be loaded started saturating at an initial input of 1 nmol per 1 mg of PLGA, and 100 pmol of the adjuvant could be loaded at this ratio. To introduce tumor antigen material, the membrane derived from B16F10 mouse melanoma cells was coated onto CpGloaded PLGA cores (CpGNPs). The process used for coating did not significantly alter the amount of adjuvant within the polymeric cores. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements showed an increase in nanoparticle size after coating, and the zeta potential of the adjuvantloaded, cancer cell membranecoated nanoparticles (CpGCCNPs) increased to approximately that of pur e membrane (Figure 2.2b,c). Successful coating was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which revealed a characteristic core-shell structure (Figure 2.2d). Over time, the CpG CCNPs stayed stable in solution (Figure 2.2e). Importantly, the presence of known membrane bound tumorassociated antigens [30], including MART1, TRP2, and gp100, was confirm ed by western blotting (Figure 2.2f). When normalized by total protein amount, significant antigen enrichment was observed on the derived membrane and CpGCCNPs when compared with whole cell lysate. 67 Figure 2.2: Preparation and characterization of CpGCCNPs. a) CpG encapsulation into PLGA cores with increasing inputs, normalized by polymer weight (n = 3, mean \u00b1 SD). b) Size of CpGNPs, B16F10 membrane vesicles, and CpGCCNPs (n = 3; mean \u00b1 SD). c) Surface zeta potential of CpGN Ps, B16F10 membrane vesicles, and CpGCCNPs (n = 3; mean \u00b1 SD). d) TEM image of CpGCCNPs negatively stained with uranyl acetate.

To study the interaction of the nanoformulation with antigen presenting cells, bone marrowderived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were employed. When incubated with dyelabeled CpG CCNPs, quick uptake was observed until saturation was achieved at 6 h ( Figure 2.3a). CpG is known to activate proinflammatory re sponses in antigen presenting cells [31], which is necessary for generati ng potent antitumor immunity. Using a fluorescently tagged CpG, the adjuvant was shown to much more readily be internalized by BMDCs when encapsulated within the membrane coated nanoparticles, which are in the ideal size range for endocytosis [32, 33] (Figure 2.3b). To test the implications of this enhanced internalization and confirm the integrity of CpG af ter 68 encapsulation, the biological activity of CpG in free form versus nanoparticulate form was assessed (Figure 2.3c,d). Secretion of two representative proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin 6 (IL6) and IL12, was significantly enhanced for the CpGCCNP formulation, which was approximately an order of magnitude more immunostimulatory than free CpG. This effect is likely due to the fact that nanoparticulate CpG more readily localizes to the endosomal compartment during uptake, where it can engage its endos omal recognition site on tolllike receptor 9 (TLR9) [34]. It should be noted that CCNPs without adjuvant induced significantly less cytokine secretion when incubated with BMDCs at equivalent nanoparticle concentrations. While the CpG employed in the studies here was murinespecific, other variant s could easily be substituted to promote immunity in humans [35] . Further, the integrity of the nanoparticle structure was assessed by fluorescent imaging using dyelabeled CpG and membrane protein, and significant colocalization of the two signals confirmed the ability of the CpGCCNPs to codeliver both adjuvant and antigen to the same BMDC (F igure 2.3e). Upon in vivo administration subcutaneously via the hock, the nanoformulation could easily be detected at the draining lymph node after 1 h, with some appearing at an adjacent node after 24 h. Little signal was observed at the spleen given its considerable distance from the injection site. Within the draining lymph node, antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages exhibited the highest percentage of nanoparticle uptake; B cells and granulocytes also displayed some uptake, while the limited amount of signal observed for T cells was likely the result of nonspecific interactions with the nanoformulation (Figure 2.3f). The effect of the nanoformulation on BMDC maturation in vitro was studied by looking at the upregulated expressi on of costimulatory markers CD40, CD80, and CD86, as well as MHCII. Consistent with the fact that the dendritic cell maturation process is largely driven by the detection 69 Figure 2.3: Delivery of antigen and adjuvant to immune cells. a) Uptake kinetics of dyelabeled CpG CCNPs by BMDCs (n = 3; mean \u00b1 SD). b) Uptake kinetics of dyeconjugated CpG in free form or within CpGCCNPs by BMDCs (n = 3; (d) by BMDCs when incubated with either free CpG or CpGCCNPs (n = 3; mean \u00b1 SD). e) Confocal microscopy colocalization of CpG and membrane proteins upon uptake of duallabeled CpG CCNPs by a BMDC.

Without CpG, the antigenonly CCNP formulation exhibited significantly decreased activity. A similar pattern was seen when assessing the secretion of IL6 and IL12 by the BMDCs. When administered in vivo , the CpGCCNP and CpGNP formulations were likewise able to induce significant dendritic cell maturation at the draining lymph node after 24 h ( Figure 2.4a -d). They also outperformed additional controls, including CCNPs wit h free CpG and whole cell lysate with free CpG, highlighting the advantage of nanoparticulate formulations. The level of cytokine secretion at the draining lymph node was shown to be mostly dependent on the presence of CpG, with all adjuvanted formulations 70 performing similarly (Figure 2.4e,f). This effect was localized, as analysis of cytokine levels in the serum did not yield anything significantly above baseline. Figure 2.4: Characterization of in vivo dendritic cell maturation.

To confirm the utility of the CpGCCNP formulation for antitumor vaccination, its ability to elicit antigenspecific immune responses was verified using T cellbased assays. First, pmel1 CD8+ T cells, which specifically recognize a gp100 epitope, were adoptively transferred to recipient mice, which were subsequently vaccinated with the various formulations ( Figure 2.5a). 71 Treatment with CpGCCNPs resulted in the highest degree of pmel1 T cell proliferation, indicating that the formulation was able to effectively deliver the gp100 antigen for presentation under an immunostimulatory context. Additionally, after a set of vaccinations in na\u00efve mice, the CpGCCNPs were able to promote the native generation of T cells with multiple tumor antigen specificities (Figure 2.5b,c). T cells specific for both gp100 and TRP2 could be isolated and expanded from mic e vaccinated with the CpGCCNPs. Further, when cultured ex vivo , immune cell preparations from mice vaccinated with the formulation showed significantly enhanced production of IFN and IL2 when stimulated with a gp100 peptide, a TRP2 peptide, or whole cel l lysate, suggesting robust effectorlevel response against those targets. While these studies were generally limited to probing for immunity against well characterized epitopes, it could be reasonably inferred that the CpGCCNP formulation was concurrently generating additional responses against other tumorrelevant antigens.

In mice vaccinated with CpGCCNPs, there was significant activity, and tumor occurrence was prevented in 86% of mice 150 d after challenge with the tumor cells. Formulations consisting of either whole cell lysate with free CpG or CCNPs with free CpG both showed modest control of tumor growth, extending median survival from 20 d for the untreated group to 34 and 40 d, respectively. All but one of the m ice in these groups reached the experimental endpoint by day 48 after challenge. CCNPs without adjuvant had minimal protective benefit, with the mice in these groups achieving a median survival of 28 days. Finally, mice vaccinated with CpGNPs that had no antigenic material exhibited tumor growth kinetics identical to the blank control and displayed a median survival of 22 d. The results suggest that codelivery of both tumor antigen material and the CpG adjuvant together in the same vehicle is necessary for eliciting maximal antitumor immunity. The fact that CpGNPs alone had no effect is encouraging and demonstrates that the inclusion of cancer 73 membrane material helped to provide appropriate cues for the specific detection and elimination of malignant cells by the immune system. Figure 2.6: Prophylactic efficacy. a -c) Mice immunized with CpGCCNPs and various control formulations, including whole cell lysate with free CpG (WC + fCpG), CCNPs with free CpG (CCNP + fCpG), CCNPs, CpGNPs, and blank solution, o n days 0, 7, and 14 were challenged with B16F10 cells on day 21. Average tumor sizes (a), survival (b), and individual tumor growth kinetics (c) were plotted over time ( n = 7; mean \u00b1 SEM). Reporting of average tumor sizes was halted after the first mouse died in each respective group. *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001 (compared to CpGCCNP in survival plot); logrank test. The utility of the nanoparticulate vaccine formulation was further tested in a more clinically relevant therapeutic setting ( Figure 2.7a -c). In this study, mice were challenged with B16F10 cells and subsequently treated with the nanoformulation. Using this design, CpGCCNPs alone displayed a modest ability to control tumor growth and extend survival. Given the aggressive nature of the B16F10 tumor model, the results were not unexpected, especially given that vaccination largely focuses on the training phase of adaptive immunity. Despite adequately 74 enabling the immune system to recognize the appropriate targets, vaccine formulations f or boosting cellular immunity may not be particularly wellsuited for potentiating effector functionality in the presence of strong immunosuppression [38] . As such, the CpGCCNPs were combined with a checkpoint blockade cocktail consisting of antiCTLA4 and antiPD1, and treatment with the combina tion enabled significantly enhanced control of tumor growth. Median survival was extended from 18 d for the blank control to 32 d for the treated group, and 50% of tumors were still below the experimental endpoint threshold on day 48 post challenge. In contrast, the checkpoint blockades, which have not shown significant efficacy in a related B16 model [39] , was about as effective as CpGCCNPs. The results confirm that the nanopart iculate vaccine formulation can act synergistically with other immunotherapies, modulating different aspects of immunity to promote the strongest antitumor responses. Figure 2.7: Therapeutic efficacy. a -c) After challenge with B16F10 cells on day 0, mice were treated using CpGCCNPs combined with a checkpoint blockade cocktail of antiCTLA4 plus antiPD1 (CTLA4/PD1), CpGCCNPs alone, or the checkpoint blockade cocktail alone on days 1, 2, 4, and 7. Average tumor sizes (a), survival (b), and individu al tumor growth kinetics (c) were plotted over time ( n = 6; mean \u00b1 SEM). Reporting of average tumor sizes was halted after the first mouse died in each respective group. *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001 (compared to CpGCCNP + CTLA4/PD1 in survival plot); logrank test. 75 2.4 Conclusions In conclusion, we have reported on a biomimetic nanoparticulate anticancer vaccine formulation capable of activating multiantigenic immunity. The design leverages the unique advantages of recent nanoparticle technology, delivering both syngeneic cancer mat erial along with a potent immunological adjuvant in a format that promotes effective antigen presentation. The final formulation is capable of generating strong antitumor responses in vivo and can work together with other immunotherapies such as checkpoint blockades to help control tumor growth. It is increasingly understood that presentation of tumor antigens alone, even in highly immunogenic contexts, may not be able to overcome the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment [38, 40] . As such, efforts have shifted toward the rational design of combinatorial approaches that leverage multiple modes of action [41 -43], including employing such strategies as adjuvant therapies to surgical resection [44]. In doing such, the potential adverse effects of immunomodulatory cocktails will also need to be considered [45] . The present nanoparticlebased cancer cell membrane coating strategy represents a generalizable and effective means of boosting endogenous immuni ty against autologous material, which may, in the future, be derived from a patient's own resected primary tumor as a means to prevent relapse. All of this is accomplished in a manner that is unique when compared to current strategies and can possibly pave the way for enhanced personalized anticancer vaccines.

Cancer immunotherapies leverage this knowledge and seek to manipulate various asp ects of the immune process in order to promote tumor destruction [3]. For example, approaches such as anticancer vaccination help to train T cells with the appropriate antigen specificities [4], while others such as checkpoint blockade therapies work by removing the mechanisms of inhibition on existing immune cell populations [5]. Each approach has its own benefits and challenges, although even the most promising immunotherapeutic modalities only work for a subset of patients, in la rge part due to the large heterogeneity among cancers [6]. Currently, most of the success i n the clinic has been biased towards treatments that augment or supplement the effector stage of immunity [7, 8], perhaps because the manipulation of these downstream immune processes is more straightforward with fewer variables to consider. There is strong evidence , however, that combinatorial treatments affecting multiple aspects of immunity can promote strong antitumor immune responses [9, 10] , and it is thus imperative that the development of immunotherapies continues along multiple fronts. Vaccines are designed to generate antigen -specific immune responses and have historically been attractive due to their ease of use and potential for broad applicability [11]. Unfortunately, vaccines formulated against cancers are notoriously difficult to develop [12, 13] . This stems largely from the fact that tumor antigens are inherently lowly immunogenic, as the y are usually based on normal antigens that are subtly mutated or differentially upregulated. To address this issue, vaccines must be formulated with potent immunological adjuvants, often in the form of toll -82 like receptor agonists, in order to boost the im mune response [14]. Delivery of antigen and adjuvant to professional antigen- presenting cells (APCs) results in the presentation of peptide epitopes in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) -I, along with costimulatory markers such as CD80 or CD86 [15]. Together, these signals are necessary in order to promote activation of the cognate T cells that can target and destroy tumor cells expressing the corresponding antigen epitope. Manipulation of the antigen presentation process is not straightf orward, and lack of potency is a common issue for anticancer vaccine formulations [16]. This is particularly true for most vaccines that are administered parenterally, where efficient delivery to the correct APC subsets is a major challenge [17] . These dif ficulties have necessitated the use of production workflows that require significant time and effort [18], greatly limiting their translational potential. Researchers have sought to gain more control over the antigen presentation process by engineering art ificial APCs (aAPCs) that can replace the function of their endogenous counterparts [19]. aAPCs can be cell -based, whereby living cells are engineered to express the appropriate MHC, as well as a costimulatory marker [20]. These modified cells have been sh own to successfully engage with and activate T cells, with potential utility for adoptive cell therapy applications. More recently, there has been significant interest in developing particulate aAPCs [21]. For these synthetic platforms, the requisite biological signals, including peptide -loaded MHC multimer complexes and CD28 agonists, of synthetic microparticles or nanoparticles. In particular, nanoscale aAPC systems may hol d significant potential given their ability to be used for in vivo applications [22, 23] , offering significant advantages such as enhanced lymphatic transport after subcutaneous administration [24]. They could ultimately be employed as a means for directly stimulating T cells that reside in the body, obviating the need for ex vivo 83 stimulation. As aAPCs bypass the need for traditional antigen processing and presentation, such platforms could also replace vaccines for certain applications. Combined with sophi sticated strategies for neoantigen identification [25], the technology could also be amenable to a high level of personalization in the future. Overall, aAPC platforms represent powerful tools for the direct activation of T cells, particularly when individual epitopes of interest can be identified. Almost all cells in the body express MHC -I, which allows internal monitoring by the immune system in the case of infection or aberrancy. This includes cancer cells, which often employ strategies to subvert immune detection by manipulating their MHC expression [26]. It should therefore be possible to leverage this antigen presentation machinery for the direct stimulation of cancer -targeting T cell populations [27], given that the correct signals are provided. Here, we first engineer a model cancer cell line to express the costimulatory marker CD80, enabling it to present its own antigens in an immunostimulatory context. The membrane from these engineered cells is then collected and coated onto a nanoparticulate subs trate [28], resulting in a biomimetic nanoformulation capable of direct antigen presentation to cancer -specific T cells (Figure 3.1). The anticancer utility of these engineered cell membrane- coated antigen -presenting nanoparticles is evaluated both in vitr o and in animal models of disease. The described platform combines the advantages of natural cell -based aAPCs with those of synthetic nanoscale APCs into a single construct that is well- suited for in vivo use. These biomimetic antigen -presenting nanoparticles have the potential to promote multi- specific T cell activation and may ultimately be used for personalized therapies. Vaccines are designed to generate antigen -specific immune responses and have historically been attractive due to their ease of use and potential for broad applicability [11]. Unfortunately, vaccines formulated against cancers are notoriously difficult to develop [12, 13] . This stems 84 largely from the fact that tumor a ntigens are inherently lowly immunogenic, as they are usually based on normal antigens that are subtly mutated or differentially upregulated. To address this issue, vaccines must be formulated with potent immunological adjuvants, often in the form of toll - like receptor agonists, in order to boost the immune response [14]. Delivery of antigen and adjuvant to professional antigen- presenting cells (APCs) results in the presentation of peptide epitopes in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)- I, along with costimulatory markers such as CD80 or CD86 [15]. Together, these signals are necessary in order to promote activation of the cognate T cells that can target and destroy tumor cells expressing the corresponding antigen epitope. Manipulation of the antigen presentation process is not straightforward, and lack of potency is a common issue for anticancer vaccine formulations [16]. This is particularly true for most vaccines that are administered parenterally, where efficient delivery to the corr ect APC subsets is a major challenge [17] . These difficulties have necessitated the use of production workflows that require significant time and effort [18], greatly limiting their translational potential. Researchers have sought to gain more control over the antigen presentation process by engineering artificial APCs (aAPCs) that can replace the function of their endogenous counterparts [19]. aAPCs can be cell -based, whereby living cells are en gineered to express the appropriate MHC, as well as a costimulatory marker [20].

Figure 3.1: Schematic of engineered cell membrane- coated nanoparticles for direct antigen presentation. a) Wild -type cancer cells, whi ch naturally present their own antigens via MHC -I, are engineered to express CD80, a co- stimulatory signal. The plasma membrane from these cells is then derived and coated onto polymeric nanoparticle cores. b) The resulting antigen- presenting nanoparticles (AP-NPs) can directly stimulate tumor antigen -specific T cells through engagement of the cognate T cell receptor (TCR) and CD28. Upon activation, the T cells are capable of controlling tumor growth by killing cancer cells that express the same antigens. 3.2 Experimental Methods 3.2.1 Cell Culture and Engineering mouse melanoma cells Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM; Mediatech) -1; InvivoGen) using lipofectamine 2000 by selection in media containing blastidicin (InvivoGen). Monoclonal selection was conducted by plating the blasticidin -selected cells in 96 -well tissue culture plates at an average density of 0.5 cells per well, and the clone with the highest expression was expanded for further study. B16- CD80 cells were maintained in culture media sup plemented with 4 \u00b5g/mL of blasticidin. To generate the B16 -CD80/OVA cell line, a gene encoding for a cytoplasmic form of ovalbumin from pCI-neo-cOVA (a gift from Maria Castro; #25097; Addgene) cloned into the pQCXIH retroviral expression vector (Clonte ch), and the resulting plasmid was used to transfect AmphoPhoenix cells (obtained from the National Gene Vector Biorepository). After 48 h, virus - containing cell culture supernatant was collected, mixed with polybrene (Sigma -Aldrich) at a final concentrati on of 4 \u00b5g/mL, and added to B16- CD80 cells. Viral transduction was facilitated by centrifuging the culture plate at 800 g for 90 min. After 48 h of transduction, selection was performed by culturing the cells in media containing hygromycin B (InvivoGen). A monoclonal cell line was obtained in a similar manner as above. B16 -CD80/OVA cells were maintained in media containing 300 \u00b5g/mL hygromycin B and 4 \u00b5g/mL blasticidin. B16- OVA cells were generated using the same protocol starting with B16- WT cells and were maintained in media containing 300 \u00b5g/mL hygromycin B. 3.2.2 Western Blotting The various cell lines were collected by scraping and lysed by sonicating in water for 5 min using a Fisher FS30D bath sonicator. Each sample was diluted to 0.7 mg/mL of protein content 88 in water based on a BCA protein assay (Pierce) and then mixed in a 3 to 1 volume ratio with NuPAGE 4\u00d7 lithium dodecyl sulfate sample loading buffer (Novex). After heating for 10 min at 70 \u00b0C, the samples were loaded into 12- well Bolt 4 -12% bis -tris ge ls (Invitrogen) and run at 165 V for 45 min in MOPS running buffer (Novex). The proteins were then transferred onto 0.45 m nitrocellulose membrane (Pierce) in Bolt transfer buffer (Novex) at 15 V for 30 min. The blots were blocked with 5% milk (Genesee Scientific) in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (National Scientific), followed by incubation with a mouse anti -ovalbumin monoclonal antibody (3G2E1D9, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as the primary immunostain and a horseradish peroxidase -conjugated secondary (Biolegend) as the secondary immunostain. Membranes were developed with ECL western blotting substrate (Pierce) in an ImageWorks Mini -Medical/90 Developer. 3.2.3 Surface Marker Characterization Flow cytometry was employed to examine the MHC -mediated surface presentation of the SIINFEKL (OVA257 -264) peptide and the expression of CD80 on the various cell lines. To facilitate the analysis of SIINFEKL presentation, the cells were incubated with 10 ng upregulate MHC -I expression [29]. Cells were collected from culture using 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (USB Corporation) in PBS and stained with Data collected using a Becton Dickinson FACSCanto- II flow cytometer and analyzed using FlowJo. 89 3.2.4 In Vitro Biological Activity of Engineered Cells All animal experiments were performed in accordance with NIH guidelines and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of California San Diego. C57BL/6- Tg(TcraTcrb)1100Mjb/J transgenic mice (OT -I; The Jackson Laboratory) were euthanized and their spleens were collected. To obtain single cell suspensions, each spleen was physically extruded through 70 \u00b5m nylon cell strainers (Fisher Scientific), followed by red blood cell removal using RBC lysis buffer (Biolegend) per t he manufacturer's instructions. The cells were then washed with 1\u00d7 PBS and CD8 + cells were isolated out by magnetic separation using CD8a (Ly -2) MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec) on MACS LS separation columns (Miltenyi Biotec) per the manufacturer's instructions. Splenocytes or isolated CD8+ cells were resuspended using warm media consisting of 500 mL Isocove's modification of DMEM with 2 mM L -glutamine and 25 mM HEPES (Mediatech) supplemented with 50 mL USDA certified fetal bovine serum (Omega Scientific), 500 L 55 mM -mercaptoethanol (Gibco), 5 mL 200 mM L -glutamine (Gibco), and 5 mL penicillin -streptomycin. Either 2 \u00d7 10 5 CD8+ cells or 3 \u00d7 106 splenocytes were incubated with 5 \u00d7 104 of the various engineered B16 cells for 24 h. For cytokine analysis, culture supernatant was collected and assayed using mouse IFN and IL -2 ELISA kits (Biolegend) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For surface marker analysis, CD8+ cells or splenocytes in culture were collected and stained with one of the two following sets of antibodies: (1) PE/Cy7- conjugated anti Biolegend), using a FACSCanto -II flow cytometer and analyzed using FlowJo. All analysis was conducted on the CD3+CD8+ T cell population. To examine the ability of the engineered cells to activate T cells specific for a native antigen, splenocytes were derived from B6.Cg Thy1a/Cy Tg(TcraTcrb)8Rest/J transgenic mice (pmel -1; The Jackson Laboratory) . Prior to the study, B16- OVA or B16 - CD80/OVA cells were cultured in the presence of 10 ng/mL recombinant mouse IFN for 1 d ay. The engineered cells were then rinsed before incubating with 3 \u00d7 106 pmel -1 splenocytes for 48 h. Afterwards, surface marker expression was analyzed by staining with PE/Cy7- conjugated anti - mouse CD3 antibody, -WT, B16- OVA, and B16 -CD80/OVA cells was collected according to a previously published protocol [30]. Briefly, cells were suspended in a lysis buffer containing 30 mM Tris -HCl pH 7.0 (Qua lity Biological) with 0.0759 (Sigma -Aldrich), 0.225 M D -mannitol (Sigma -Aldrich), and a cocktail of phosphatase and protease inhibitors (Sigma -Aldrich), followed by physical disruption using a Kinematica Polytron PT 10/35 probe homogenizer at 70% power for 15 passes. The membrane was separated by first centrifuging at 10,000 g and then centrifuging the resulting supernatant at 150,000 g to obtain a membrane pellet using a Beckman Coulter Optima XPN -80 mg/mL was added dropwise into 1mL of water and the mixture was placed under a vacuum aspirator to evaporate the organic solvent. Membrane coating was carried out by mixing the preformed PLGA cores with the membrane at the appropriate ratios and sonicating the mixture for 2 min in a Fisher Scientific FS30D bath sonicator. 3.2.6 Nanoparticle Optimization and Characterization To optimize the nanoformulation, [CD80/OVA]NPs were fabricated at membrane to polymer weight ratios of 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 in water and then adjusted to 1\u00d7 PBS using 20\u00d7 PBS (Teknova). Nanoparticle size and surface zeta potential were measured by dynamic light scattering using a Malvern ZEN 3600 Zetasizer. To evaluate stability over time, nanoparticles were suspended in 10% sucrose (Sigma -Aldrich) solution and stored at 4 \u00b0C for two weeks; size was monitored every 2 days. For electron microscopic vis ualization, freshly synthesized nanoparticles or nanoparticles stored for 1 week at 4 \u00b0C in 10% sucrose were first deposited onto carbon- coated 400-square mesh copper grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences), followed by negative staining with 1 wt% uranyl ace tate (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Imaging was performed on a Tecnai Spirit transmission electron microscope. The pull -down assay was conducted by first suspending nanoparticles at in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; , the corresponding isotype antibodies were incubated with the nanoparticles for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C . After incubation, the nanoparticles were centr ifuged at 21,000 g, and the fluorescence of the supernatant was measured. Binding was calculated as (initial fluorescence - supernatant fluorescence)/(initial fluorescence) and normalized to the value for the 92 corresponding isotype antibody. 3.2.7 In Vitro Biological Activity of Engineered Nanoparticles To evaluate nanoparticle biological activity, 8 \u00d7 105 CD8+ cells or 3 \u00d7 106 splenocytes from OT-I mice were cultured in the presence of 100 g/mL of each nanoformulation for 3 days. CD25, CD69, CD44, and CD62L surface marker expression, as well as IFN and IL -2 secretion, were analyzed as described above. To measure biological functionality after storage, nanoparticles stored for 1 week at 4 \u00b0C in 10% sucrose were incubated with 8 \u00d7 105 OT-I CD8+ cells at 100 g/mL for 3 days. Expression of CD25 and CD69 on the CD8+ T cells was measured as described above. For the cell proliferation study, 3 \u00d7 106 splenocytes derived from OT -I mice were labeled using CellTrace Violet (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and incubated with the various nanoformulations at a concentration of 0, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 g/mL. After 3 days of incubation, the cells were collected and stained with PE/Cy7- conjugated -mouse a Becton FACSCanto- II flow cytometer and analyzed using Flo wJo. All analysis was conducted on the CD3 +CD8+ T cell population. To quantify fold expansion, splenocytes derived from OT -I mice were cultured in 24 -well plates at a density of 4 \u00d7 106 cells per well. Nanoparticles were added to the wells at a final concentration of 100 g/mL. On day 4, the cells were collected and stained with PE/Cy7 -conjugated anti -mouse CD3 antibody and FITC CD8a antibody for enumeration by flow cytometry. Fold expansion was calculated by normalizing the total numb er of CD3 +CD8+ T cells on day 4 to the number on day 0. To measure cell killing, CD8+ cells derived from OT -I mouse were activated in the presence of 50 g/mL of 93 [CD80/OVA]NPs and 20 ng/mL of recombinant mouse IL -2 (Biolegend) for 3 days. On the day before the assay, target B16 -WT and B16- OVA cells were plated at a density of 1 \u00d7 104 cells per well in a 96 -well plate in the presence of 10 ng/mL of recombinant mouse IFN. To perform the assay, the target cells were first rinsed twice with culture media, and then 5 \u00d7 104, 1 \u00d7 105, or 2 \u00d7 105 activated CD8+ cells were added, followed by incubation for 18 h at 37 \u00b0C. The cytotoxicity was measured by an LDH assay (Biolegend) per the manufacturer's instructions (Biolegend). To examine the ability of the nanopartic les to activate immunity against native antigens, 3 \u00d7 106 pmel - 1 splenocytes were cultured with 100 g/mL of nanoformulations fabricated using membrane derived from engineered cells pretreated with 10 ng/mL recombinant mouse IFN for 72 h. Expression of CD 69 was examined as described above. 3.2.8 In Vivo Delivery To evaluate the in vivo localization of the nanoparticles, 400 g of [CD80/OVA]NPs labeled 0.1 -3,3,3',3' - tetramethylindodicarbocyanine dye (Biotium) were subcutaneously into the flanks of OT -I mice. The subcutaneous administration route was chosen over the intravenous route due to the propensity of the latter for generating tolerance [31]. At 0, 12, and 24 h, the inguinal lymph nodes were collected and cryosectioned, followed by fixation in 10% phosphate -buffered formalin (Fisher Chemical) for 15 min at room temperature. After fixation, the slides were blocked with 2% BSA in PBS for 30 min and stained with 7.5 g/mL FITC -conjugated anti -mouse CD8a antibody in 2% BSA solution overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Finally, the slides were mounted in Vectashield mounting media (Vector Laboratories) and imaged on a Keyence BZ -X710 fluorescence microscope 94 3.2.9 In Vivo Biological Activity Whole-body irradiation was performed on female C57BL/6 mice (Envigo) at a dosage of 6 Gy. After 1 day, 2.5 \u00d7 107 splenocytes derived from OT -I mice were labeled with CellTrace Violet and adoptively transferred into each irradiated mouse by intravenous injection. The next day, 450 g of the various nanoformulations in 10% sucrose was injected subcutaneously into each the neck, left flank, and right flank. After another 3 days, the inguinal and axillary lymph nodes were collected and processed into single cell suspensions, after which they were stained with PE/Cy7 -conjugated anti -mouse Dickinson FACSCanto -II flow cytometer and analyzed using FlowJo. All analysis was conducted on the CellTrace +CD3+CD8+ T cell population. To assess cytokine secretion, whole -body irradiation was performed on female C57BL/6 mice at a dosage of 6 Gy and, after 1 day, 2 \u00d7 107 splenocytes derived from OT -I mice were adoptively transferred. The next day, 450 g of the various nanoformulations in 10% sucrose was injected subcutaneously into each the neck, left flank, and right flank. After another 4 days, the inguinal and axillary lymph nodes were collected and processed into a single cell suspension, which was cultured in 250 L of media in a 96- well tissue culture plate. After 3 days of culture, the supernatant was collected and assayed using a mouse IFN ELISA kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. 3.2.10 In Vivo Antitumor Efficacy To study prophylactic efficacy, whole -body irradiation was performed on female C57BL/6 95 mice at a dosage of 5.5 Gy. After 1 day, 1 \u00d7 107 splenocytes derived from OT -I mice were adoptively transferred into each mouse by intravenous injection. The following day, 400 g of nanoparticles was subcutaneously injected into each the neck, left flank, and right flank. Tumor challenge was performed by subcutaneous administration of 4 \u00d7 105 B16- OVA cells into the lower right flank after another 5 days. To study therape utic efficacy, female C57BL/6 mice were first challenged with 5 \u00d7 105 B16- OVA cells. Whole- body irradiation at a dosage of 5.5 Gy was performed on day 6 after tumor inoculation. On day 7, 1 \u00d7 106 CD8+ T cells derived from OT -I mice (main therapeutic study) or 1 \u00d7 107 splenocytes derived from OT -I mice (whole cell lysate study) were adoptively transferred into each mouse by intravenous injection. Treatment was administered on days 8 and 13 by subcutaneous injection of 300 g of nanoparticles into each the neck, left flank, and right flank. Whole cell lysate was prepared by resuspending B16- OVA cells in water and subjecting them to 3 freeze -thaw cycles. Mice were administered on days 8 and 13 with lysate at a dosage where the amount of membrane material was eq uivalent to the [CD80/OVA]NP sample [30], along with 10 g of CpG 1826 (InvivoGen). To study therapeutic efficacy without irradiation and adoptive transfer, female C57BL/6 mice were first challenged with 3 \u00d7 10 5 B16- OVA cells. Treatment was administered on days 3 and 7 by subcutaneous injection of 300 g of nanoparticles into each the neck, left flank, and right flank. Tumors were measured every other day and the experimental endpoint was defined as either death or tumor size greater than 200 mm 2. 3.3 Results and Discussion 96 To engineer cancer cells capable of displaying their own antigens under a stimulatory WT) murine melanoma cell line was selected as the foundation. These cells are syngeneic to C57BL/6 mice and can readily be used to generate immunocompetent tumor models [32]. It has been confirmed that these cells express a certain degree of MHC class I [33], which can present peptide epitopes from endogenous antigens to CD8+ T cells. For this study, the B16- WT cells were modified to overexpress two different genes. The first was a cytosolic form of ovalbumin (OVA) [34], which was selected as a model antigen given the wide range of immunological tools available to help facilitate its study. The second was the costimulatory marker CD80, which engages the CD28 receptor found on T cells [35]. When the two signals are presented together, CD80 and a peptide -MHC complex are generally sufficient to promote the activation of the cognate T cells. Stable cell lines were developed for both single knock- in clones, denoted B16- CD80 and clone, denoted B16- CD80/OVA. F rom western blotting analysis, it was confirmed that both B16- OVA and B16 - CD80/OVA expressed the OVA protein, while no signal was detected for either B16 -WT or B16- CD80 ( Figure B16- CD80 and CD80/OVA B16- WT and B16 -OVA cells had little to no expression (Figure 3.2b). For the OVA -expressing clones, it was further confirmed that they were properly displaying the OVA -derived SIINFEKL peptide bound to H -2Kb (Kb - -I (Figure 3.2c). This indicated that the cytoplasmic OVA was being properly restricted by endogenous cellular machinery for presentation to the immune sys tem. When plotting CD80 expression versus Kb- SIINFEKL presentation, it was evident that the B16- CD80/OVA clone was positive for both signals required to activate anti -OVA cytotoxic T cell responses. (Figure 3.2d) 97 Next, the biological activity of both membr ane-bound signals was evaluated to confirm that the engineered cells could promote the activation of antigen -specific T cells. Splenocytes derived from OT -I transgenic mice, whose CD8+ T cells predominantly express the T cell receptor against Kb -SIINFEKL [36], were incubated with each of the B16 -F10 variants. After 24 h of incubation, the CD8+ T cells in the mixed -cell population were immunophenotyped using flow cytometry. Upregulation of CD69 is a hallmark of T cell activation [37], and the marker was highly expressed on CD8+ T cells cocultured with B16- CD80/OVA cells. In contrast, B16- OVA cells produced a modest response, while both B16- WT and B16- CD80 cells had low expression. A similar tren d was observed for CD25, an interleukin- 2 (IL -2) receptor that aids in the clonal expansion of T cells [38]. In terms of memory T cells [39], only the B16- CD80/OVA cells were able to increase the proportion of CD8+ T cells with the CD44highCD62Lhigh central memory phenotype, while the effect on the CD44highCD62Llow effector memory phenotype was less pronounced. In terms of cytokine secretion, IL -2 and interferon- (IFN), both of which are essential for the survival and function of CD8+ T cells [40], were only found in high concentrations in the media of splenocytes cocultured with B16- CD80/OVA cells. The various engineered B16- F10 cells were then incubated and tested in a similar manner with purified OT -I CD8+ cells, which should have a higher proportion of OVA -specific cytotoxic T cells (Figure 3.2e -l). The overall trends observed for this set of studies was largely consistent with the mixed splenocyte study, with the exception that the B16- CD80/OVA cells were able to clearly enhance the population of T cells with the CD44highCD62Llow effector memory phenotype. It was also confirmed that the CD80- modif ied cells could stimulate pmel- 1 CD8+ T cells (Figure 3.2m), which are specific against the native melanoma antigen gp100 present on B16- WT [41]. Overall, this data confirmed the 98 successful engineering of cancer cells capable of presenting their own antigens to activate specific T cell subsets.

The use of modified cancer cells in vivo would likely be accompanied with numerous safety concerns and face significant hurdles in terms of clinical translation. Thus, we sought to generate 99 a nanoformulation safe for in vivo use by leveraging cell membrane coating nanotechnology, which is a stre amlined approach for the top- down fabrication of highly functional nanoparticles that mimic many of the functions of living cells [28]. These biomime tic nanoparticles have been used in a number of different applications, including drug delivery [42-44], detoxification [45-47], and vaccine design [30, 48] . In terms of immune modulation, a major advantage of the technology is that it can help to stabilize membrane vesicles and decrease t heir size, thus enhancing in vivo transport upon subcutaneous administration [49]. Having confirmed the functionality of both surface -bound signals on the engineered B16- CD80/OVA cells, their membrane was then derived using a procedure involving cellular disruption and differential centrifugation. The purified membrane was collected and coated onto the surface of preformed polymeric nanoparticle cores by a s onication process [50]. It should be noted that the nanoparticle core serves an important function to stabilize the membrane coating and prevent unwanted fusion [48], thus facilitating enhanced lymphatic transport [49]. The CD80/OVA [CD80/OVA]NPs) was optimized by synthesizing the nanoparticles in water with varying weight ratios of the engineered cell membrane to polymer, followed by adjusting the resulting formulations to isotonic phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to match physiological conditions (Figure 3.3a). Without any membrane coating, the charge screening effect resulting from the presence of ions in the buffer caused the bare polymeric cores to aggregate significantly. This effect lessened at higher coating ratios, suggesting progressively better surface coverage. Based on the data, it was determined that the optimal membrane- to-core weight ratio was 1:2, and this [CD80/OVA]NP formulation was used for all subsequent studies. 100 Figure 3.3: Fabrication and characterization of engineered antigen -presenting na noparticles. a) Size of [CD80/OVA]NPs at different membrane to core weight ratios when suspended in water or PBS (n = 3; mean + SD). b,c) Hydrodynamic diameter (b) and surface zeta potential (c) of bare PLGA cores, B16 - CD80/OVA membrane vesicles, and [CD80/OVA]NPs (n = 3; mean + SD). d,e) Transmission electron microscope images of [CD80/OVA]NPs immediately after synthesis (d) and after 1 week of storage (e). Scale bars = 100 nm. f) Size of [CD80/OVA]NPs over 2 weeks (n = 3; mean \u00b1 SD). g,h) Relative binding of antibodies against Kb- SIINFEKL (g) and CD80 (h) to [WT]NPs, [OVA]NPs, and [CD80/OVA]NPs (n = 3; mean + SD). When measured by dynamic light scattering, the final [CD80/OVA]NPs were approximately 100 nm in size after coating, which was in between the si zes of the bare polymeric cores and the membrane vesicles (Figure 3.3b). Zeta potential measurements revealed that the surface charge of the membrane -coated nanoparticles was near the value of pure membrane vesicles, which were less negative than the highl y charged polymeric cores (Figure 3.3c). While both these pieces of data suggested successful membrane coating, the nanoparticles were further observed under transmission electron microscopy after negative staining (Figure 3.3d). The imaging revealed a nar row size distribution, as well as a characteristic core-shell structure that further confirmed the membrane coating. The physical appearance of the nanoparticles remained 101 unchanged after 1 week of storage in solution (Figure 3.3e). To further test their st ability in solution over time, the [CD80/OVA]NPs were suspended in isotonic sucrose, and they exhibited no increase in size during a 2 -week observation period (Figure 3.3f). Finally, to verify that the nanoparticles retained the signals required for T cell activation, immunofluorescence pull -down assays were conducted to confirm the presence of intact CD80 and Kb- SIINFEKL (Figure 3.3g,h). The experiment showed that nanoparticles made using plasma membrane from the B16-CD80/OVA double knock- in clone ([CD80/OVA]NPs), expressed both markers, whereas nanoparticles fabricated the B16- OVA single knock- in clone (denoted [OVA]NPs), was high made from B16- WT cells (denoted [WT]NPs), yielded baseline signals for both markers. While the amount of both the CD80 and Kb- SIINFEKL per [CD80/OVA]NP was dictated largely by the optimal membrane coating ratio, it is possible to modulate the density of each marker by sourcing the membrane from B16- CD80/OVA clones with different levels of expression. With the successful fabrication of the [CD80/OVA]NP formulation, its biological activity was assessed in vitro to determine if it could activate antigen -specific T cells. The nanoparticles were incubated with OT -I splenocyte s, and the effect on various CD8 + T cell phenotypes, including CD69+, CD25+, central memory, and effector memory, was evaluated. A similar trend was observed as compared with whole cells, where only [CD80/OVA]NPs were able to elicit the phenotypic changes. Incubation with [OVA]NPs and [WT]NPs had minimal impact on OT -I CD8 + T cell activation state. In terms of cytokine secretion, the results were striking, as signals for IL -2 and IFN were barely detectable for all sample groups other than the [CD80/OVA]NPs . The advantages were largely consistent when incubated with purified OT -I CD8+ cells (Figure 3.4a-h), and again the double knock- in [CD80/OVA]NP formulation was able to positively modulate the 102 CD44highCD62Llow effector memory phenotype under this experime ntal setup. It was confirmed that the activity of the nanoparticles was largely retained even after storage in solution for 1 week (Figure 3.4i,j). When looking at their ability to promote antigen- specific T cell proliferation, [CD80/OVA]NPs were able to induce a significant amount of cell division as demonstrated by a dye dilution assay, whereas all of the control samples had a minimal impact on the state of the cells (Figure 3.4k). This effect was shown to be dependent on nanoparticle concentration, and [CD80/OVA]NPs at 100 \u00b5g/mL caused a majority of the T cells to experience proliferation (Figure 3.4l). The T cell activation properties of the nanoparticles was also confirmed by quantifying expansion, where the [CD80/OVA]NP -treated cells multiplied by nearly 9 -fold in 4 days, whereas cell counts for all other groups dropped below the initial value at the beginning of the experiment (Figure 3.4m ). OT -I CD8 + cells activated using [CD80/OVA]NPs were able to preferentially kill cellular targets expressing the model antigen (Figure 3.4n). Overall, it is quite notable that the [CD80/OVA]NPs had significantly enhanced biological activity compared with [OVA]NPs, as this demonstrated that the T cell activation was not simply due to the introduction of OVA into the system. It was also confirmed that the CD80- modified nanoparticles could stimulate pmel- 1 CD8 + T cells specific against the melanoma antigen gp 100 (Figure 3.4o). 103 Figure 3.4: Biological activity of engineered antigen -presenting nanoparticles. a -d) Expression of CD69 (a,b) OT incubated with [CD80/OVA]NPs and control nanoparticles for 3 days (n = 3, mean + SD). e,f) Frequency of memory phenotypes CD44highCD62Lhigh (e) and CD44highCD62Llow (f) among OT -I CD8+ T cells incubated with [CD80/OVA]NPs and control nanoparticles for 3 days (n = 3, mean + SD). g,h) Secretion of IL -2 (g) and IFN (h) by OT -I CD8+ T cells incubated with [CD80/OVA]NPs and control nanoparticles for 3 days (n = 3, mean + SD). i,j) Expression of CD69 (i) and CD25 (j) by CD8+ T cells in a population of O T-I splenocytes after 3 days of incubation with [CD80/OVA]NPs either freshly made or stored for 1 week (n = 3, mean + SD). k,l) Fluorescent signal dilution of CD8+ T cells in a population of OT -I splenocytes labeled with CellTrace Violet after incubation with [CD80/OVA]NPs and control nanoparticles (k) or [CD80/OVA]NPs at various concentrations (l) for 3 days. m) Fold expansion of CD8+ T cells in a population of OT -I splenocytes after incubation with [CD80/OVA]NPs and control nanoparticles for 4 days (n = 3, mean + SD). n) Cell killing by OT -I CD8+ cells activated by [CD80/OVA]NPs for 3 days and then incubated with B16- OVA or B16 -WT cells at various effector to target (E:T) ratios for 18 h (n = 3, mean \u00b1 SD). o) Expression of CD69 by CD8+ T incubated with [OVA]NPs or [CD80/OVA]NPs for 3 days (n = 3, mean + SD). **p < 0.01, ***p < 104 After confirming the activ ity of the antigen- presenting nanoparticles in vitro , we next performed a set of in vivo characterizations. To evaluate their transport characteristics, fluorescently labeled [CD80/OVA]NPs were subcutaneously administered into OT -I mice, and the draining lymph nodes were collected at various time points for histological analysis (Figure 3.5a) . At the time of injection, it could be seen that the lymph node was absent any nanoparticle signal, while CD8+ T cells were dispersed within various regions of the lymph node. At 12 h post -injection, the nanoparticle signal started to strengthen along the periphery of the lymph node. Finally, after 24 h there was a significant amount of nanoparticle fluorescence that could be visualized beyond the edges of the lymph node, and this signal was found to be adjacent to a significant number of CD8 + T cells. To evaluate the biological activity of the nanoparticles after in vivo delivery, [CD80/OVA]NPs were administered to C57BL/6 mice that had been adoptively transferred with OT-I splenocytes. The CD69 activation marker was found to be significantly upregulated on adoptively transferred CD8 + T cells in mice that were administered with [CD80/OVA]NPs, whereas those treated with [WT]NPs or [OVA]NPs had CD69 levels consistent with baseline (Figure 3.5b). This trend was also seen when looking at cytokine secretion, whe re cells derived from the lymph nodes of [CD80/OVA]NP -treated mice secreted significantly higher levels of IFN as compared to the control groups (Figure 3.5c). 105 Figure 3.5: In vivo delivery and activity of engineered antigen- presenting nanoparticles. a) Immunofluorescence images of draining lymph node sections taken from OT -I mice at different periods after administration of dye -labeled [CD80/OVA]NPs.

The ability of the [CD80/OVA]NP formulation to control tumor growth was first tested in a prophylactic setting on an immunocompetent tumor model developed using B16- OVA cells (Figure 3.6a). Mice were first irradiated, followed by adoptive t ransfer of OT -I splenocytes. The next day, nanoparticle formulations were administered subcutaneously, and tumor cells were implanted after another 5 days. When observing tumor growth, it could be seen that both [WT]NPs and [OVA]NPs had minimal impact on the growth kinetics when compared with the control group 106 administered with vehicle only (Figure 3.6b,c). On the other hand, mice treated with [CD80/OVA]NPs exhibited delayed tumor growth. This was also reflected in the survival data (Figure 3.6d), where the control, [WT]NP, and [OVA]NP groups had median survivals of 35, 34, and 35 days, respectively. In comparison, the [CD80/OVA]NP group had the best median survival of 44 days, with one mouse completely rejecting tumor challenge for the duration of the study. The antitumor activity was also evaluated in a more difficult to treat therapeutic scenario (Figure 3.6e). In this case, the tumor was implanted first, followed by irradiation for leukodepletion, adoptive transfer of OT -I CD8 + cells, and then treatment with each of the nanoformulations. The [WT]NP and [OVA]NP formulations again had minimal impact on tumor growth, while the [CD80/OVA]NP formulation was able to delay the growth kinetics (Figure 3.6f,g). In terms of median surviva l, the blank control, [WT]NP, and [OVA]NP groups had values of 29, 31, and 27 days, respectively, while the [CD80/OVA]NP group had an extended median survival of 37 days (Figure 3.6h). It was also confirmed that therapeutic efficacy could be achieved in th e absence of leukodepletion and adoptive transfer, as [CD80/OVA]NP treatment was able to delay the growth of established B16- OVA tumors in unmanipulated mice. When benchmarked against a whole cell lysate vaccine adjuvanted with CpG 1826, the antigen- presen ting nanoformulation was able to better control tumor growth and prolong survival. In this case, the improved efficacy of the [CD80/OVA]NPs may likely be attributed to their ability to present more relevant antigenic material to the immune system [51] . 107 Figure 3.6: In vivo prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy. a) Experimental timeline for prophylactic efficacy study. b- d) Average tumor sizes (b), individual tumor growth kinetics (c), and survival (d) over time for the prophylactic efficacy study (n = 6; mean \u00b1 SEM). e) Experimental timeline for therapeutic efficacy study. f-h) Average tumor sizes (f), individual tumor growth kinetics (g), and survival (h) over time for the therapeutic efficacy study (n = 6; mean \u00b1 SEM). ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 (compared to [CD80/OVA]NP in survival plot); log- rank test. 108 Throughout both the in vitro and in vivo assessment of our platform, only the experimental group expressing both CD80 and the OVA antigen was able to generate significant biological activity. This indicates that the observed effect was not simply due to endogenous processing of the antigenic material, but rather it was more likely a result of direct antigen presentation by the nanoparticles. In its current form, [CD80/OVA]NP was only able to promote a modest survival benefi t, which may be attributed to the fact that the process for eliciting antitumor immunity is highly complex. The notion that effective antigen presentation alone cannot be expected to overcome the various immunosuppressive strategies employed by tumor cells is supported by the current landscape of antitumor vaccination, where durable responses are hard to achieve despite generation of T cell subsets with the correct specificities [52] . It is for this reason that resea rchers are actively exploring the combination of vaccines with other immunotherapies to more comprehensively activate immunity on multiple fronts [53], and this is a strategy that will likely benefit aAPC platforms. In addition to issues posed by the tumor microenvironment, the membrane protein expression profile of the parent cells may al so present its own set of challenges. The B16- F10 cell line employed in the present study is known to express low amounts of MHC -I while also expressing programmed death- , and these immunosuppressive mec hanisms may combine to undermine the immune -activating stimulus provided by CD80. While the main goal of the present work was to demonstrate that immune activity can be modulated via genetically engineered cell membrane- coated nanoparticles, the platform could be improved through further engineering of the cancer cells to address immune evasion mechanisms or to introduce additional immune -activating surface markers. Other avenues for improving efficacy could involving optimizing nanoparticle size to maximiz e lymphatic drainage [55] or to the cells with IFN to upregulate MHC expression [29]. Overall, the strategy outlined in this article serves as a 109 blueprint for how to engineer complex, multimodal cell -cell interactions using biomimetic nanotechnology, and there are countless opportunities for modulating cellular function natively via their surface markers in a manner that is unique from traditional therapies. 3.4 Conclusions In conclusion, we have constructed a biomimetic nanoscale aAPC platform capable of directly activating T cells against tumor antigens based on the direct presentation of epitopes found on cancer cells. This was achieved by engineering cancer cells to expre ss costimulatory markers in order to leverage their endogenous antigen presentation machinery. The membrane from these cells, which contained the requisite signals for T cell stimulation, was then stabilized onto a nanoparticulate substrate to enable in vi vo application. It was demonstrated that the double knock- in [CD80/OVA]NP formulation was able to control tumor growth in murine models. One of the key advantages of this biomimetic approach towards antigen presentation is its ability to bridge the gap tha t exists between current cell -based and synthetic nanoparticle -based anticancer immunotherapies. On one hand, the non -living nature of the biomimetic antigen -presenting nanoparticles eliminates concerns associated with the derivation, manipulation, and re - administration of patient- derived cells, which should simplify manufacture and quality control. On the other hand, the biomembrane component readily enables the presentation of multiple tumor antigens without requiring the specific identification of the re levant epitopes. Further, there has been evidence suggesting that the fluidity afforded by lipid membrane structures can enhance antigen presentation efficiency [56, 57] . It is also notable that the anticancer immunity in the present study was generated in the absence of other immunostimulatory compounds, such as 110 adjuvants, cytokines, or checkpoint blockades, which may be included in the future within the nanoparticle core to enhance treatment potency by providing additional immunological signals. With regards to clinical translation, the well- established workflows for modifying patient -derived cells in chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy can be adapted for engineering autologous cancer cells prior to fabricating the antigen -presenting nanoparticles [58]. Ultimately, the platform represents an effective means of producing tumor -targeting immune cell subsets and could be combined with other modes of immunotherapy to produce a more comprehensive solution for generating robust antitumor responses in the clinic.

This anticancer vaccine utilizes natural cancer cell membrane as the multivalent tumor antigen source to generate specific immune responses to a heterogenous portfolio of cancer antigens and prevent immune evasion commonly seen in single - antigen vaccines. Adjuvants encapsulated in the polymeric core can engage dendritic cells in an immunostimulatory manner to elicit a strong immune response and prevent immune tolerance of natural tumor antigens with low immunogenicity. Formulated as a nanoparticle, the a nticancer vaccine is around 120 nm in size. This nanometer size range is ideal for phagocytosis by antigen- presenting cells as well as draining into lymph nodes, where the immune priming occurs . It is demonstrated that both in vitro and in vivo , the nanova ccine can efficiently drive dendritic cell uptake and maturation, and lead to T cell activation and expansion. Furthermore, w hen combined with additional immunotherapies such as checkpoint blockades, the nanovaccine demonstrates substantial therapeutic effect. Overall, the work represents the rational application of nanotechnology for immunoengineering and can provide a blueprint for the future development of personalized, autologous anticancer vaccines with broad applicability. 4.2 Engineered Cell Membrane- Coated Nanoparticles Directly Present Tumor Antigens to Promote Anticancer Immunity 118 The recent success of immunotherapies has highlighted the power of leveraging the immune system in the fight against cancer. In order for most immun otherapies to succeed, T cell subsets with the correct tumor -targeting specificities must be mobilized. This chapter presented a biomimetic nanoparticle platform that can be used to directly stimulate T cells without the need for professional antigen -presenting cells. Our T cell -activating nanoparticles are fabricated using a cell membrane coating derived from cancer cells engineered to express a T cell co -stimulatory marker. Combined with the peptide epitopes naturally presented on the cell membrane s urface, the final formulation contains the two necessary signals to promote tumor antigen- specific T cell immune responses. It is demonstrated that both in vitro and in vivo , the nanoparticle can significantly activate and expand specific T cell subsets . Primed T cells can secret e immunostimulatory cytokines, mount cytotoxicity to tumor cells carrying the cognate antigens, and inhibit tumor growth in both prophylactic and therapeutic settings. Overall, the reported approach represents an emerging strategy that can be used to develop multiantigenic, personalized cancer immunotherapies. 4.3 Future Outlook In the past several decades, researchers have leveraged increases in the knowledge of tumor immunology to develop therapies capable of augmenting endogenous immunity and eliciting strong antitumor responses. In particular, the goal of anticancer vaccination is to train the immune system to properly utilize its own resources in the fight against cancer. Recently, there has been a significant push in vaccine design toward the use of nanotechnology which offers the advantage of flexibility to purposefully program immune responses. This new generation of nanovaccines, 119 especially the novel biomimetic platforms covered in the Chapter 2 and 3 of this dissertation, has shown to elicit strong, multiantigenic antitumor responses, and can be translated to the clinic in the future as personalized immunotherapies with enhanced potency and specificity. Toward clinical translation, there are two important considerations we could not overlook. First, there have been significant interests in recent years to use combination t herapies in the clinical space. The biomimetic nanoparticles presented above could be employed in tandem with other cancer treatment regimens, such as surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy as well as other immunostimulatory compounds, such as cytokines and checkpoint blockades, in order to simultaneously address various tumor evasive mechanisms. Second, the scaled manufacturing of biomimetic nanoparticles would be a challenge for future researchers to take on. Thanks to the prosperity of antibody drug and cell therapy for the past decade, there has been significant advancement in culturing and engineering both cell lines and autologous cells on a large scale. The relevant workflows and techniques could be adapted for handling cells and cell memb rane materials "}
