Hypertension is rampant across the world and has put several lives in danger. Awareness regarding hypertension is the first step towards preventing it. Hypertension - or elevated blood pressure :-- is a serious medical condition that significantly increases the risks of heart, brain, kidney and other diseases. What is Hypertension :- Blood pressure is the force exerted by circulating blood against the walls of the body's arteries, the major blood vessels in the body. Hypertension is when blood pressure is too high. Blood pressure is written as two numbers. The first (systolic) number represents the pressure in blood vessels when the heart contracts or beats. The second (diastolic) number represents the pressure in the vessels when the heart rests between beats. A normal blood pressure is considered less than 120 systolic pressure and less than 80 diastolic (120/80 mmHg). Prehypertension is considered in the ranges of 120-139 systolic pressure and 80-90 diastolic pressure. Hypertension in state one systolic pressure between 140-159 and diastolic pressure 90-99 Hypertension in state two is considered a systolic blood pressure greater or equal to 160 and a diastolic blood pressure greater or equal to 100. Hypertensive emergency it is a considerable increase in blood pressure with a diastolic blood pressure greater than 120. Within this category we can find accelerated hypertension which is defined as a systolic pressure greater than 120 and a diastolic pressure greater than 130. The main causes of hypertension are :- sedentary lifestyle and improper diet. a diet of packaged food with preservatives and chemicals, which have high fat content result in digestive problems. This eventually leads to ama (toxins) accumulation, giving way to high blood pressure.physical inactivity, consumption of tobacco and alcohol, and being overweight or obese. A family history of hypertension, age over 65 years and co-existing diseases such as diabetes or kidney disease. Inability to handle mental stress and disconnect with the basic principles of natural living gives rise to hypertension. Ayurvedic Treatment for Hypertension :- Hypertension is the condition in which an individual has elevated blood pressure. Ayurveda gives the best remedies to control your elevated blood pressure. Hypertension is caused by Vata vitiation. Occasionally there is the involvement of Kapha as well as pitta. In some cases, there is an obstruction in body channels which in turn causes a Vata imbalance. Role of Doshas in hypertension. Excessive alcohol & salt intake :- Pitta, Raktha vitiation Anger, stress, anxiety :- Vata imbalance Excessive oily foods, sedentary lifestyle :- Kapha imbalance. By all these causes the blood or raktha gets accumulated with toxins. The vitiated doshas will negatively influence the quality of blood. The blood flow is influenced by Vata. And the quality of blood is affected by vitiated Kapha as well as pitta dosha. So there is high-pressure exertion on the walls of the blood vessels. Ayurveda way to treat Hypertension : - 1) Management of primary hypertension- hypertension not due to any other underlying disease :- The vitiated doshas are treated respectively. If the dosha vitiation is extreme, shodhana chikitsa is followed. Kapha dosha. purificatory therapies, doshas attain a balance, then shaman therapy is done.

In short, if you are diabetic, then treat diabetes first, automatically your blood pressure will be normalized.
