OPEN ACCESS Freely available online Effective Uses, Risk Factors and Procedures for Acupuncture Martins Ohrbach * Department of Traditional Medicine, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil DESCRIPTION Acupuncture involves inserting a very fine needle through your skin at a strategic point in your body. Acupuncture is an important part of traditional herbal medicine and is most commonly used to treat pain. Increasingly, it is used for general well-being, including stress management. Traditional Chinese medicine explains that health is the result of a harmonious balance of complementary extremums of \"yin\" and \"yang\" of vitality known as \"qi\" pronounced \"ki\". Illness is said to be the result of an imbalance in power. Qi is said to flow through the meridians and pathways of the human body. These meridians and energy flows are accessible through 350 acupuncture points in the body. Inserting needles at these points in the proper combination is said to rebalance the flow of energy. There is no scientific evidence that meridians or points of acupuncture exist and it is difficult to prove their existence, but many studies suggest that acupuncture works in some conditions. Some experts use neuroscience to describe acupuncture. Acupuncture points are considered places where nerves, muscles and connective tissue can be stimulated. Stimulation promotes blood circulation and at the same time stimulates the activity of the body's own analgesics. Because acupuncture is invasive, it is difficult to carry out research with proper scientific management. In clinical trials, controls should receive quackery or placebo to compare results with actual acupuncture. Some studies have concluded that acupuncture has similar benefits to patients as placebo, while others have shown that there are some real benefits. Uses It's done correctly and it's safe. There are few side effects. Can be effectively combined with other treatments. Can reduce some pain. Can help patients who are not suitable for painkillers. Risk The risk of acupuncture is minimal when you have a competent and certified acupuncturist who uses sterile needles. Common side effects include pain, simple bleeding, and bruising where the needle is inserted. Disposable needles are now the norm, minimizing the risk of infection. Not everyone is a good candidate for acupuncture. There may be a risk of complications if: Bleeding disorder: If a person is have a bleeding disorder or are taking anticoagulants, you are more likely to have needle bleeding or bruising. Pacemaker: Acupuncture, in which a gentle electric pulse is applied to the needle, can interfere with the movement of the pacemaker. Pregnancy: Some types of acupuncture are thought to stimulate labor and can lead to preterm birth. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulate acupuncture needles as medical devices, and their manufacture and labeling must meet certain criteria. The needle must be sterile, non-toxic and have a disposable label from a qualified physician. As with any complementary therapy, it is recommended to be used in parallel with conventional treatments for chronic or serious illnesses. Procedure Acupuncture points are in all areas of the body. Sometimes the corresponding points are far from your area of pain. The acupuncturist will tell you the general location of the planned treatment and if you need to undress. Bathrobes, towels or sheets are provided. You lie on a padded table for treatment. Insert needle: Acupuncture needles are inserted at strategic points at various depths of the body. The needle is so thin that it is usually not too uncomfortable to insert it. In many cases, people don't feel included at all. Typical treatment uses 5 to 20 needles. You may feel a slight pain when the needle reaches the proper depth. Needle operation: After inserting the needle, the doctor may gently move or twist the needle, or apply heat or a low level of electrical pulse to the needle. Needle removal: In most cases, the needle will stay in place for 10- 20 minutes while you lie down and relax. As a general rule, there is no sense of discomfort when pulling out the needle.

However, not everyone responds to acupuncture. If symptoms do not improve within a few weeks, acupuncture may not be appropriate. The benefits of acupuncture can be difficult to measure, but many find it useful in controlling a variety of painful conditions. However, some studies have shown that some types of simulated acupuncture appear to work like real acupuncture. There is also evidence that acupuncture is most effective for people who expect it to work. Acupuncture has few side effects, so it may be worth trying if you have trouble controlling pain with traditional methods. "}
