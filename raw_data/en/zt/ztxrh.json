But there are many other things patients can do to protect their liver and improve their health. Below is our list of the top 10 healthy choices that can be started today! - Schedule regular visits with your liver specialist or health care provider to stay on top of your health and the health of your liver. - Get the Hepatitis A vaccine to protect yourself from another virus that attacks the liver. - Avoid drinking alcohol and smoking since both will hurt your liver, which is already being injured by the hepatitis B virus. - Talk to your provider before starting any herbal remedies or vitamin supplements because some could interfere with your prescribed hepatitis B drugs or even damage your liver.

Mold is more likely to be a problem if food is stored in damp conditions and not properly sealed. If there is mold, then the food could be contaminated by \"aflatoxins,\" which are a known risk factor for liver cancer. - Reduce your stress levels by eating healthy foods, exercising regularly, and getting plenty of rest. Keep in mind everything you eat, drink, breathe, or absorb through the skin is eventually filtered by the liver. So protect your liver and your health. "}
