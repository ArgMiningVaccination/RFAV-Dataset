Unfortunately, due to our modern diets and multiple other factors, it can make getting enough nutrients difficult and leaving close to 92% of people deficient in at least one nutrient. Magnesium deficiency is one of the most common amongst my patients. And while it might not seem super important at first glance, it is responsible for over 300 biochemical reactions and plays a role in everything from your sleep quality to your heart health. That's why I believe we all should be getting more magnesium into our lives. Read on to learn more about how magnesium can help you reclaim your health.

Magnesium health benefits 1. It helps you sleep Magnesium is essential for your brain's GABA receptors to function optimally, which play a role in regulating your sleep-wake cycle. In fact, studies [have shown](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23853635/) that people with insomnia were able to improve their sleep with regular magnesium supplementation. (1) 2. It reduces headaches Many people with chronic headaches and migraines are deficient in magnesium and many others have genetic mutations that make metabolizing magnesium difficult. Magnesium helps headache sufferers find relief as it works to relax blood vessels in the brain that are constricted during times of headaches. 3. It alleviates muscle cramps Have you ever been jolted awake out of a dead sleep from a muscle spasm? If so, you might not be getting enough magnesium since this nutrient is responsible for proper neuromuscular transmission and muscle contraction. 4. It keeps you regular Constipation is no fun, especially chronic constipation. Many supplements designed to get you moving again are formulated with magnesium because of its ability to quickly give you relief. Magnesium works by increasing the amount of water in your intestines to loosen up your stool and move it through. While this is great for constipation, be careful with taking too much magnesium in supplement form or you might just experience the opposite problem! 5. It enhances cognitive function Magnesium can do wonders for your brain in more ways than one. Not only does it help improve short- and long-term memory, it also improves [neuroplasticity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6024559/) (your brain's ability to adapt and heal) to improve your memory in the present as well as preventing age-related memory loss. (2) 6. It boosts your energy Feeling tired every day might be common, but it's certainly not normal. Whether you are suffering from chronic fatigue due to a [magnesium deficiency](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1672392/) or just looking to enhance your energy with magnesium's ability to regulate cortisol levels - the hormone that contributes to adrenal fatigue when out of balance - magnesium supplementation can help! (3) 7. It calms anxiety In cases of anxiety, your excitatory NMDA receptor in your brain has gone out of control. It's a case of \"too much of a good thing\" and magnesium can help calm this down to reduce symptoms of anxiety. 8. It strengthens your bones Magnesium really does everything doesn't it? Studies have even shown that magnesium is [necessary](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10617959/) for healthy bones to reduce your risk of fractures and breaks as you age. (4) 9. It helps manage ADHD Due to magnesium's role in brain function and neurotransmitter activity, studies [have shown](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9368236/) its ability to help calm symptoms of the neurodevelopmental disorder ADHD, with regular supplementation. (5) 10. It supports cardiovascular health High blood pressure has long been associated with poor cardiovascular health. Studies have looked at the correlation between magnesium and heart health, with results showing a significant decrease in both [blood pressure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4419474/) (6) and [overall heart disease risk](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12972103/) (7) when magnesium supplements were added. How to get more magnesium Thankfully, it's not hard to add more magnesium into your life. In fact, a lot of foods contain magnesium and it's a matter of adding more into your diet. Some of my favorites include pumpkin seeds, avocados, dark chocolate, almonds, and wild-caught salmon. However, if you are dealing with a magnesium deficiency or looking to really target one of these health problems, supplementation might be necessary along with dietary changes. A functional medicine doctor can run labs to help you determine if you are deficient. While you can get magnesium supplements at most health food stores, the absorption rate is pretty poor. This is because most magnesium supplements are primarily used for constipation relief rather than targeted health support. Plus, there are often a lot of unnecessary added ingredients that aren't doing your health any favors. That's why I went ahead and formulated my supplement [The Magnesium](https://drwillcole.com/product/the-magnesium) with carefully curated magnesium compounds backed by research and studies for their enhanced bioavailability - specifically Albion chelated magnesium plus MagteinTM (magnesium L-threonate), the only form of magnesium proven in animal studies to cross the blood-brain barrier. Because I know firsthand just how important magnesium is for your overall health I wanted to make getting more magnesium easier for you.
