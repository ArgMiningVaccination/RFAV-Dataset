I love to get to the bottom of things and have a limitless imagination. Kindness always guides my actions. Being all water signs, I have the ability to adapt promptly to any circumstances and take on the feel of my surroundings. I also comprehend things others are unable to. ENERGY SENSITIVE As a Blu Ray being (the primary color of my auric field), I am an empath and clairsentient. Born hyper-sensitive physically, spiritually, and emotionally, I have to be careful with my energy and memetic environment. I am a huge fan of grounding, energetic protection and boundaries, as well as energetic clearing, which helps stabilize and balance the emotional body. In addition to energetic tools, I also use the ancient art of smudging, incense, plant distillations, and a cinnamon broom or selenite wand, based upon alignment and my or my client's preferences. These methods all cleanse the aura and energetic fields in various supportive ways, neutralizing the energetic charge between two beings or objects. I love listening and working with others\u2014giving back while learning, growing and teaching what I have learned. SPIRITUAL I felt the call of a religious and spiritual life early on. As a young child, my mother raised us as a Christian Scientists, which greatly impacted my outlook on Western medicine. I became a born again Christian when I was 11, then went to Catholic high school and studied world religions, which introduced me to polytheism and reincarnation. At age 19, I began to study astrology, numerology, and psychology. In my late 20's, I studied Rudolf Steiner's teachings through the Center for Anthroposophy. In my 30's I began to study the chakras, energy meridians, Chinese medicine, and naturopathic remedies. In the most recent years, I've studied the works of Abraham Hicks, Louise Hay, Barbara Clow, Sonia Choquette, Aurelia Louise Jones, Bren\u00e9 Brown, Danielle LaPorte, Gabby Bernstein, Brendon Burchard, Joseph Campbell, and others. HOLISTIC Every time I am out in nature, it's confirmed repeatedly: I am a healer, and I have been in many of my lifetimes. Through holistic nutrition, herbalism and plant energy, essential oils, crystals, energetic clearing, and protection, I have acquired many gifts and skills that I enjoy sharing with others. "}
