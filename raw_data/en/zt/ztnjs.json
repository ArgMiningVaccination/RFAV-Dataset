This game is...", "sitename": "plantsvszombies.fandom.com", "date": "2015-01-25", "cleaned_text": "Continuing from [the one before it](/wiki/Thread:228217). This game is something of a variation on Kill the Godmodder, where instead of a Godmodder with insane power, it is a \"raid boss,\" or giant enemy designed for a group of people, to take out. While they are a lot easier to hit than a godmodder (90% of attacks WILL hit), Raid Bosses have HP in the thousands as base, and much more punishing attacks. If you kill the current Raid Boss, another raid boss with 1500 more HP will take its place. Note 1: Do not expect all attacks to hit the Raid Boss. They are tough, but certainly killable. Note 2: Raid Bosses are ROGUE, meaning they will attack anyone, including those who align with him. Note 3: Raid Boss loot drops cannot be duplicated, destroyed, or created by anyone other than me. Doing so will result in the item handicapping your character extremely. Raid Boss Artifacts: - Rage of the Ancients From the ashes he will rise.-- Wielded by JemCel, grants 3x damage to fire-based attacks, but a halving to all non-fire attacks. Immunity to fire damage. - Cheater's Prosper Sheep in wolves' clothing! -- Wielded by no one, grants the ability to damage allies to boost your own attacks, at the cost of being more likely to be attacked. Allies can damage you. - Rage of the Cryptids Take a chill pill man. -- Held by Hal lucination. Ice attacks deal triple normal damage, and enemies frozen by your attacks take double damage from all sources as long as they are frozen. Immunity to ice damage. Non-ice attacks deal half normal damage. - Rage of the Future Maybe lightning does strike twice. --Wielded by IMCR8Z. Electric attacks deal triple normal damage. Multiple hits in a row to the same target exponentially increases electric attack damage. Halving to all non-electric attacks. Immunity to electrical damage. - Breath of Gargantua His breath made the mightiest tame Wielded by no one -- Triple corrosive and poison damage. Corrosive attacks will deal lingering damage equal to one-third the attack's initial strength for two turns. Poison attacks will have a random chance to make enemies turn against others. Immunity to both corrosion and poison. Halving to all non-corrosive/poison damage. - Bone of Gargantua His brawn could bear the mightiest flame Owned by no one -- Absorption effect. Getting hit by an element charges you with that element, making your attacks deal bonus elemental damage and granting immunity to that element until you are knocked out or hit by another element. - Heart of Gargantua His heart could empower Wielded by The Zombie O.O -- Allows the ability to revive allies should they be knocked out. - Grit of Gargantua His teeth can devour Wielded by TheAdmiral777 -- Allows the ability to attack while knocked out. Attacking while knocked out is very likely to miss. Knocking out an ally or killing an enemy will also revive you. - Aura of Toxicity Who's stinking up the place? Wielded by no one -- When an enemy uses a short-ranged attack against the wielder, they recieve damage from a toxic aura! The closer they got, the more damage they take! - Freezer of Minions Minions...so many frozen minions Wielded by no one -- Buffs ice-related minions summoned by the user, granting double health and attack strength. All non-ice minions the user summons have half health however. - Animosity's Armour Resisting tons of damage since ancient times Wielded by Eongaming -- This armour has its own health, only once that health is reduced to zero can you be knocked out, and when you recover, the armour will be back to max health. The problem: When you do get knocked out, you get knocked out for a lot longer than normal. HP: 370/500. - Core of Electron My power level is OVER 9000! Wielded by Testosteron9374 -- Grants a damage multiplier to your attacks. Starts at 0.5x but increases by 0.5 each turn, with no limit. When knocked out, it resets to the 0.5x multiplier. Multiplier: 12.5x. - Artifact Snatcher You don't mind if I borrow your Artifact, do you? Wielded by Bolt-Weed -- Lets you use another player's Artifact while they are KO'd. Doesn't allow you to use Grit of Gargantua, Animosity's Armour or Core of Electron. - Phase Crystal 100% Adapted for defensive purposes Wielded by Reapeageddon -- The wielder of this Artifact becomes slightly out of phase. This means that enemy attacks are extremely likely to miss, however the user's attacks will deal 25% less damage. Also applies to minions summoned by that player. - Telepathy Component You cannot hide your thoughts from me! Wielded by no one -- Allows the user to see into the thoughts of the Raid Boss, which they communicate to their allies. I will automatically give everyone hints about what will happen next turn, but only if the user of the artifact posts something. - Artifact Maker I can make whatever I want, whenever I want Wielded by DeathZombi -- Allows you to create your own custom artifacts to equip to yourself. However, these artifacts are extremely unstable, and will break whenever you get KO'd or damaged. You also cannot copy any other artifact. You must also beware of unforeseen side effects that your custom-made artifacts could have. - Miniboss Master I control this miniboss, now bow beneath me! Wielded by Crazyzombie168 -- When equipped, if you charge up for three to five turns to summon a really powerful minion, it will be a miniboss. Minibosses have at least 1000 health and much more damaging attacks. Unfortunately, you will be unable to summon regular minions. - Rage of Darkness You won't like me when I'm angry Wielded by Iamarepeater -- As you damage enemies, you gain rage. Once you have at least 100 rage, you can enter rage mode to grant a massive damage buff for a few turns, although damage caused in this mode will not allow you to regain rage. The more rage you have when you enter rage mode, the bigger the buff and the longer it lasts. Current Rage: 200/1000. - Sword of Evil Ultimate power comes at a price. Wielded by AzureAzulCrash -- The sword grants the wielder a 2.5x damage boost to all attacks, and a 50% chance to counter incoming attacks, surviving and damaging the attacker. Unfortunately, the sword will only grant its powers to someone who commits an act of evil. KO an ally for two turns using the sword, to get the sword's power for one turn. Allies KO'd like this cannot be revived. Wielder of Animosity's Armour cannot be KO'd unless the armour is reduced to 0HP. - Omnipotent Orb The key to immortality, but at what cost? Wielded by Lapis Lazulli -- Grants TOTAL immunity to attacks, meaning the boss and his minions cannot KO you or even apply negative effects of any kind. However, the wielder cannot serve the Raid Boss, and has a massive attack damage reduction, inflicting 75% less damage than normal. - Pandora's Box (three available) What's in the BOOOXXX! Provides a random buff or debuff upon the opener when activated. Anything can be inside. Feeling Lucky? Raid Bosses killed: 10. Current Raid Boss: Necromancer of Current Raid Boss HP: 6922/12000. The Necromancer is frozen! Attack him 20/20. The only Raid Boss that doesn't directly attack, preferring to hide behind his many undead minions while he heals them constantly, it can be difficult to hit him because his minions can get in the way and protect him. However, the biggest problem with this boss...is that he can bring back the previous Raid Bosses from the dead, albeit with severely reduced health. While a former Raid Boss is summoned, the Necromancer is immune to all attacks, and constantly focuses on healing that one Raid Boss. "}
