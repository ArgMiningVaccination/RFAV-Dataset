Well\u2014your skin can do the same thing. And if you're anything like me, then maybe you've found yourself (intentionally or not) using this time of social distancing as a chance to reset your skin (although I boarded the clean beauty train close to a decade ago). Without having to worry about societal taboos, this is the perfect time to give your skin a little breather, go makeup-free, and explore holistic and clean skincare products made with whole, all-natural ingredients! I encourage you to develop a new self-care ritual, one that will finally allow your largest organ time to heal. Once I understood the importance of our largest organ (our skin), and the damage caused by the copious amounts of chemicals we load on to our skin daily, I made a serious commitment to non-toxic skincare and clean beauty. And in this time of self-nurturing, I've discovered another magical holistic skincare brand whose products and message fits PERFECTLY with my do-less, stay-natural lifestyle. Say hello to [For The Biome.](https://forthebiome.com/) These are the things that come to mind when I think about their products: - CLEAN beauty - Mindfulness - Natural herbs - Microbiome - Sustainable - Holistic skincare Since I started using some of their products, my skin has been glowing! A Few Things I LOVE from FOR THE BIOME First of all, For the WHAT? If you're wondering what \"biome\" means, we're talking about the trillions of friendly bacteria living on your skin. When treated with care, these bacteria help protect, hydrate, and nourish your skin. That's why For The Biome products are expertly crafted with natural ingredients that work WITH your microbiome and help reawaken your skin's innate resilience\u2014which for years has been shot down again and again by stress, toxins, harsh chemicals, processed foods, and other nonsense. Co-founded by master herbalist Paul Schulick and meditation teacher Barbi Schulick, For The Biome, cares about more than just your skin\u2014the company cares about the person living in it, too! They offer things like live guided meditations and other features that honor the whole BODY AND MIND well-being, which is something that genuinely resonates with me. My Fuddhist philosophy envelops a vital and essential way of thinking about the body\u2014not as separate body parts and organs, but as part of a whole person, inseparable from the thoughts, emotions, and experiences that make up our personalities and histories. Health and happiness are found in the whole picture. For the Biome also envelops this same philosophy. They have a genuine understanding that your internal state is a direct reflection of your external state. I love this. The clean beauty plus? Their products are certified vegan and contain 100% whole ingredients\u2014absolutely no fillers and chemical preservatives that can damage your skin and tick off your microbiome! Their [Sentient Starter Set](https://forthebiome.com/collections/frontpage/products/sentient-starter-set) is HEAVEN SENT and the perfect place to start if you're new to this company and the holistic skincare lifestyle in general. Here are the three products it contains: [Empower Powder 2-in-1](https://forthebiome.com/collections/frontpage/products/empower-powder-2-in-1): a cleanser and mask duo that contains ten botanicals, six probiotic strains, and reishi mushroom. It's one of the first cosmetics to be certified microbiome-friendly by ONLA, certified cruelty-free by Leaping Bunny, certified non-toxic by EWG Verified, Certified Vegan, and Certified Organic. YES PLEASE. It makes my skin feel SUPER hydrated and loved. [Adapt Essence Spray](https://forthebiome.com/collections/frontpage/products/adapt-essence-spray): this is a refreshing artisanal fermented mister that contains five species of organic, US-sourced mushrooms, blackstrap molasses, and a plethora of lactobacillus! I love the healthy dewy look it gives my skin. I also love knowing it supports my skin's microbiome against pollution and blue light radiation, which is pretty hard to avoid in this day and age. [Shield Face Serum](https://forthebiome.com/collections/frontpage/products/shield-face-serum): The potent source of antioxidants, including volcanic CO2 extracted and organic astaxanthin derived from microalgae, help fight harmful free radicals that can age and damage your skin. Your skin protects you, and this stuff protects your skin\u2014seriously. The waterless, non-greasy serum is incredibly hydrating. It's also Certified Organic, Certified Vegan, certified cruelty-free by Leaping Bunny and certified non-toxic by EWG Verified. My Challenge to You (Your Skin Will Love This!) For The Biome has a TON of products you can choose from, and right now, they're offering a [Free Tool Kit](https://forthebiome.com/collections/frontpage/products/your-tool-kit) ($30 Value) with your first order of any powder cleanser or mask, as well as free 2-day shipping on any order. But if you're interested in testing them out, I think the [Sentient Starter Set](https://forthebiome.com/collections/frontpage/products/sentient-starter-set) is the best place to begin. They also have a [Discovery Trial Set](https://forthebiome.com/products/discovery-trial-set?_pos=2&_sid=a71ca9769&_ss=r) that allows you to try a sampler (2-4 uses) of the entire line for $38. MY TIPS FOR A BETTER EXPERIENCE, based on what I've been learning so far with my own clean skincare routine: - Use the Sentient Starter Set is for at least 14 days. - If you can, try going without makeup during this time. Remember: we have to let our friendly bacteria chill, recover, and do their thang! - On days that you do not wash your face, be sure to use the Essence spray and Shield Face Serum for enhanced moisturization. - If you do wear makeup, I recommend the Gentle Dual Cleansing Cloth (included in the free Tool Kit). Every blue moon I sport some mascara, and I can say it takes off waterproof mascara like a CHAMP. Have you tried For The Biome? If you have (or if you plan to), let me know what you think! In the meantime, I'll just be over here, putting my best face forward even if I'm only staying at home. "}
