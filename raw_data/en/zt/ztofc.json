The booster studies: oAre small and looked at immune response tests rather than protection against illness or infection. oHave not yet been reviewed by independent experts. oMore research is underway, including ongoing clinical trials. Data will be available in the coming weeks. We have strong evidence over the last year that the monovalent booster provides important protection against severe COVID -19 disease. Boosters remain important to maintain protection against severe COVID -19. 17ACIP 9/1/22: Updates on COVID -19 BA.4/BA.5 | Supplement bivalent booster enhances neutralization against BA.2.75.2 and BQ.1.1 (Preprint, Posted 11/1/22)18 CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Influenza Surveillance Update | October 20, 20222022 Southern Hemisphere Influenza Season Summary Shift in seasonal influenza activity in 2021 and 2022 in several southern hemisphere countries: oShifted start and end periods oChanges in magnitude Influenza activity has resumed in these countries following changes in transmission during the COVID -19 pandemic H3 has predominated in many southern hemisphere countries in 2022; however, South Africa has had significant circulation of A(H1N1) and B/Victoria viruses.19 CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Influenza Surveillance Update | October 20, 2022Influenza Summary Influenza activity remains low in the U.S. overall but is increasing. Numbers are small but, so far, influenza A (H3N2) viruses are predominant in the U.S.; too early to tell what viruses will be predominant for the season 1 of the 4 vaccine components were updated for both the Southern and Northern Hemispheres for the current season. The components selected for the 2022 -2023 Northern Hemisphere vaccine, at this time, look appropriate for our season. Interim effectiveness data will be available from CDC later in the season.

While flu vaccine is not 100% effective at preventing infection, it can still help protect against severe disease and death. During the 2019 -2020 flu season , flu vaccination prevented ~ 7.5 million influenza illnesses, 3.7 million influenza - associated medical visits, 105,000 influenza -associated hospitalizations, and 6,300 influenza -associated deaths. Those illnesses and deaths were prevented even when flu vaccine was only 39% effective. 23Upcoming CDC COCA Call 24Title: 2022 -2023 Seasonal Influenza Testing and Treatment During the COVID -19 Pandemic Date: Tuesday, November 15, 2022 Time : 11:00AM -12:00PM, PDT CDC Emergency Preparedness and Response COCA CallsDuring COCA Calls/Webinars, subject matter experts present key emergency preparedness and response topics, followed by meaningful Q&A with participants.

Except for RSV -associated death in children under 5 years of age, RSV is not a reportable condition in California ;therefore, individual cases of RSV are not reported to public health agencies. 26RSV Detections in California 27 California Weekly Report for Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses, Week 42 (October 16th -22nd, 2022)RSV Hospitalizations at Kaiser Northern CA Facilities 28 California Weekly Report for Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses, Week 42 (October 16th -22nd, 2022) RSV Treatment and Prevention Currently no vaccines available, although some are under development Currently no specific treatments indicated for most patients For most people, the best ways to protect against RSV: Frequent hand washing, staying home when sick, covering coughs and wearing a mask in crowded indoor gatherings. Palivizumab is a monoclonal antibody given monthly to certain high -risk children for immunoprophylaxis during RSV season. CDPH released a health advisory on October 3, 2022, alerting health care providers to the early increase in RSV activity and recommending the use of Palivizumab in eligible high - riskinfants. 29 Storage & Handling Amy Pine, CDPH 30Short -dated Monovalent Vaccines Moderna has submitted a request to the FDA for a shelf -life extension for monovalent vaccines. Please quarantine and continue to store those vaccines. Pfizer will submit a request to the FDA for a shelf -life extension of their Orange (5 years -11 years) and Gray Cap (12 years+) presentations. The goal is to prevent a supply gap for any of these vaccines. Bivalent vaccines to the rescue? Discussions begin in January 2023 to approve bivalent primary doses. ETA Q1 or Q2. 31Upcoming Vaccine Expiry Many lots of Pfizer and Moderna are expiring in the coming weeks, so: Pay close attention to the expiration dates of your vaccines Always double check expiration date before administering the vaccine Always quarantine or dispose of any expired vaccine so that it does not get accidentally administered 32 Expiring soon!

On day 15 of illness, he was diagnosed with monkeypox and prescribed oral tecovirimat on day 20 of illness . On day 24 of illness, he presented to the hospital with worsening skin lesions, oral pain, and inability to tolerate oral intake. 100On Admission The patient noted watery diarrhea since exploratory laparotomy (2015), constipation for the past week and intermittent confusion in the past month. Vitals: oTemperature: continued Physical exam: oHead, ears, eyes, nose, and inflammation, a gingival and plaque -likelesions on the tongue and mucosal surfaces with yellow -white color. oSkin: facial pustular lesions including erosion to the right nostril and scattered lesions in different stages, including open sores with serous drainage. The perirectal area had areas of erythema and excoriations. oAbdomen: diffuse, mild, abdominal tenderness to palpation. 102Notable Hospital Course Events Initially treated for Clostridium difficile Microbiology notable for 1 day of Staphylococcus epidermidis Patient had severe proctitis leading to large bowel obstruction (rectal tube in and out), difficulty with oral intake due to pain , abdominal distension, partial parenteral nutrition then total parenteral nutrition Hospital day 16: had sepsis, right sided exudative pleural effusion, chest tube was placed, started to develop anasarca Hospital day 2: had severe facial swelling leading to concern for airway compromised, stepped up to intensive care unit Hospital day 25: was intubated due hypoxic respiratory failure Hospital day 26: had septic shock with multiorgan failure. Significant leukemoid reaction with WBC up to 126 x 103/\u00b5L Hospital day 27: transitioned to comfort care and passed 103Results 104Autopsy confirmed the patient's cause of death was disseminated MPX disease. Histology samples were negative for malignancy or other infectious process. All lesion samples were positive for Orthopoxvirus polymerase chain reaction including: oBone oKidney oGastrointestinal Fig. 2 Left hand, multiple lesions including coalescing lesions Fig. 3 Epiglottis with scattered ulcerative lesionsFig. with esophagus showing an epithelial cell with an intracellular eosinophilic inclusion, consistent with a Guarnieri body (arrow) Results, continued Bone marrow, spleen and lymph node histology showed features consistent with evidence of hemophagocytic 15 postmortem specimens More analysis is being conducted at the CDC 107108 Fig. 6 Markedly hypercellular bone marrow (99% hyperlobated megakaryocytes, occurring in a background of necrotic debris and high cell turnover.

Measure therapeutic drug levels for Tecovirimat. If specimens are obtained from individuals who received tecovirimat but continue to have new lesions form or have poor clinical or virologic response, consider sending specimens to CDC for resistance testing (non -clinical laboratory improvement amendments). Second line therapies could be recommended including cidofovir or vaccinia immune globulin intravenous (VIGIV). Patients with HIV/AIDS, particularly those with low CD4+ counts, and infected with MPX should be closely monitored. Consultation regarding treatment options with local departments of health, and CDC, should take place early if hospitalized patients are not improving. 111MPX Vaccine Update Cora Hoover, M.D., MPH, CDPH Immunization Branch 112Weekly Vaccine Doses Administered by Dose Series 167,671 First Doses 94,179 Second Doses 113New CDC Flexibility Around Subcutaneous Dosing 114On CDC JYNNEOS website under: Health Equity Considerations \"Have both subcutaneous and intradermal vaccine administration options available on site so that those unable or unwilling to receive the intradermal regimen can receive the subcutaneous regimen\"On CDC JYNNEOS website section under: Vaccination Administration Considerations for Specific Populations Offering a subcutaneous dose is appropriate if a patient does not want an intradermal vaccine Vaccination Administration Considerations for Specific Populations | CDCTalking Points for Patients on JYNNEOS Vaccine 115Recommended for at-riskgroups for prevention of MPX infection and severe disease Available as both intradermal or subcutaneous injection oIntradermal recommended by CDC oThose who would prefer subcutaneous administration are able to receive vaccine via this route Specifically, open discussion with vaccine hesitant patients and those from racial/ethnic minority groups (Black/Latinx) CDPH Considerations for Expanded CDPH Subject Matter Experts 116CDPH MPX Page: Vaccine Resources Vaccine Q&A for Providers Vaccine Q&A for Public Vaccines Page : oResource Links oAllocation Process Local Health Departments MPX with Resources117 EZIZ MPX Vaccine Resources Includes : Intradermal Clinical guidance Vaccine information Storage and handling Standing orders Coding information Screening checklist EZIZ MPX Resources118119Resources and Support Type of Support Description Access CDPH health care provider MPX clinical guidance including case definitions, diagnosis, laboratory information, healthcare settings, special populations, infection control, case reporting, and vaccine administration/distributionClinical Guidance MPX EZIZ (eziz.org/resources/monkeypox/ ) siteincludes: Intradermal instructions, clinical guidance, vaccine information, storage and handling, standing orders, coding information, screening checklist, and more CDC Information for Healthcare Professionals (www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/clinicians/) site includes case definition, clinical guidance, clinical considerations for pain management, vaccine info, and clinician FAQs Updated 10/11/2022QuestionsEmail MPX questions to MPXinfo@CDPH.ca.gov Or you can submit MPX -related questions to CDPH's online intake portal General information Questions 120 During today's session, please use the Q&A panel to ask your questions so CDPH subject matter experts can respond directly .
