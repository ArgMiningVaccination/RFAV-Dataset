Fortunately, the TRICARE Dental Program covers emergency dental care. You'll pay no cost-share for emergency dental services regardless of your pay grade or location. But there are still steps you may need to take to ensure your teeth and gums stay protected in an emergency. News Copayments, Cost-Shares, and Other TRICARE Costs You Should Know When it comes to health care costs, \"copayment,\" \"cost-share,\" and \"deductible\" are terms you might hear a lot. But what do these terms mean, and how might they affect you? Local News Military Health System: How Ideas Are Adopted to Help Patients, Providers New evidence-based practices can improve health care, yet they don't always get adopted. There are many reasons for this, including a lack of awareness, lack of training and implementation support, and a reluctance to doing things differently than in the past\u2014to name a few. Even mandates to adopt a certain new service or practice may not overcome some of these barriers. News TRICARE Laboratory Developed Tests Demonstration Extended, Certain Tests Now Covered The Defense Health Agency (DHA) announced the five-year extension of the Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs) Demonstration. This means that if you have TRICARE, you'll continue to have access to certain LDTs that aren't approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The DHA also announced that TRICARE will now cover several preconception and prenatal carrier screenings that were previously offered through the demonstration as part of the basic TRICARE benefit.
