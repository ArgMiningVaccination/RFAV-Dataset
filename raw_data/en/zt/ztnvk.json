You can use this course for own healing and spiritual development and also as a therapy either complete as it is or you can utilise those aspects and techniques that would fit into any other practise you are already using. The symbols work well with Reiki and I am a Reiki Master and have had no conflict with the energies. Modules 1-4 25% off for Members Description The course is in four modules and each module comes in several sessions. This should make it easier for you to work your way through at your own pace. There are demonstrations inserted within each recorded session and I am including the links to these videos in your work plan so that you can easily replay them at any time. It would be helpful to have a journal to hand for any notes, thoughts or ideas that you have as you are working through the course and to record any experiences you have in meditations or in healing sessions. For each module there is homework and additional suggestions videos, webinars and reading. To receive a certificate at the completion of the course you will need to send me an overview case study of four people you have worked with using the symbols and healing techniques. You will find a form for your case study reports at the end of this document. You will be sent a list of dates and times when I will be giving a live Zoom session for Q & A and further discussion. Please let me know if you wish to attend any of these sessions. I look forward to connecting to you at our live sessions.
