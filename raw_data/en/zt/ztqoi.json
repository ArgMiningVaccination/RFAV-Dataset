She received antenatal corticosteroids on postoperative day 0 to 1 because of contractions, which resolved with tocolysis per standard protocols. She was discharged with treatment with nifedipine 20 mg every 6 hours. A second fetal MRI was performed at 29 3/7 weeks ' gestation. The expected postrepair changes were visualized, including signi cant improvement of the Chiari II malfor- mation from grade 3 to grade 1 (Fig 1B). Lateral ventricu- lomegaly was present, which was measured 18 mm in maximal dimension. Follow-up ultrasonography revealed normal amniotic fluid volume and fetal growth, but cho- rioamnion separation developed at 31 weeks 'gestation, as well as progression of ventriculomegaly (the maximum ventricular measurement was 22.5 mm at 33 weeks ' gestation). The patient presented at 33 2/7 weeks' gestation with vaginal bleeding and loss of fluid, and she was con rmed to have premature preterm rupture of membranes. She was admitted and received a second course of betamethasone and latency antibiotics. On hospital day 3, she developed worsening vaginal bleeding concerning for possible abrup- tion, and was taken for cesarean delivery.NEONATAL COURSE A 2,311-g viable female neonate was delivered via repeat cesarean section at 33 5/7 weeks 'gestation.

Her initial physical examination ndings were signi cant for a slight decrease in lower extremity tone and muscle mass, but spontaneous movement was noted in both legs and feet. Upon inspection of the fetal MMC repair site, there was a small (2 -3 mm in diameter) area where a gap was noted between the healing skin edges. The underlying dural patch was visible but no CSF leak was evident. An infectious evaluation for rupture of membranes was negative, and the infant received broad-spectrum antibiotics for 48 hours. Oral/nasogastric feedings were started on the rst day after birth, and she advanced to full enteral feedings by 4 days of age. She was able to transition to full oral feedings at 35 days of age. The infant was voiding and passing stools spontaneously bu t did receive regular bladder Figure 3. Fetoscopic repair of a myelomeningocele (MMC). A.

Her medical history was signi cant for polycystic ovarian syndrome, migraine headaches, seasonal allergies, and anxiety. She had a surgical history of wisdom teeth extraction and 2 prior cesarean sect ions. She was taking prenatal vitamins and using vaginal progesterone for an obstetrical history of 3 early rst-trimester spontaneous abortions. She had no family history of neural tube defects, but 1 child with Asperger syndrome and sensory processing disorder and 1 child with speech delay. Prenatal laboratory testing was unremarkable. Imaging at the referring obstetrician 's ofce was signi cant for an L3 lesion with a dangling choroid. Amniocentesis per- formed by the referring provider showed a normal female karyotype and microarray. She was referred to our center at 23 5/7 weeks 'gestation, with imaging and multidisciplinary team meeting at 24 6/7 weeks 'gestation. The following results were obtained: Fetal echocardiography showed normal cardiac anatomy and function. Fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed colpocephalic con guration of the lateral ventricles, measuring 11 mm bilaterally, a normal third ventricle and effacement of the fourth ventricle. There were also ndings of grade 3 Chiari malformation, including a small posterior fossa with herniation of cerebellar tissue into the midcervical spine, which partially wraps around the brainstem (Fig 1, A). An open spinal dysraphism of the lumbar spine was seen, measuring approximately 2.7 1.2 cm at the skin surface. No sac was identi ed, which suggested a diagnosis of myeloschisis. Ultrasonography showed splaying of vertebral elements at L3, normal lower extremity positioning (no clubfoot) and motion, a cervical length of 3.5 cm, and no other fetal anomalies. EXPERT OPINION At our center, families with a fetal diagnosis of MMC undergo a combined multidisciplinary counseling session that includes maternal-fetal medicine, fetalAUTHOR DISCLOSURE Dr Kingma has participated in research and consultations for Airway Therapeutics Inc, Cincinnati, OH.

A midline maternal laparotomy was per- formed for uterine exposure and a fetoscopic approach with 3 minicannulas (2- and 3-mm diameter) was used forrepair. Fetal intramuscular injection with an anesthetic cocktail (fentanyl, atropine, vecuronium) was given. Mater- nal anesthesia was maintained with inhalational agents for uterine relaxation per standard protocols. Using ultrasound guidance, fetal repositioning was performed. Amnioinsuf- flation was performed with warm humidi ed carbon diox- ide up to 10 mm Hg. Once the cannulas were introduced, the placode was identi ed and carefully released into the spinal canal (Fig 3). The fascia and skin around the defect were freed, and a patch was introduced over the placode as a dural substitute. This patch was attached to the fascia with 4-0 barbed absorbable sutures. The skin was primarily closed using running continuous 3-0 nonabsorbable barbed sutures with the wound closure device. Intra-amniotic anti- biotic (nafcillin) and warm lactated Ringer fluid were intro- duced after carbon dioxide was removed. Previously, introducer sites were closed u nder direct visualization to approximate the membrane ori ce edges. The midline maternal laparotomy was then closed with usual methods. Fetal echocardiography was performed throughout the procedure, with no fetal distress or Doppler changes noted. The patient was monitored in house per standard guide- lines until postoperative day 6. Initial pain control was managed with an epidural catheter, followed by transition TABLE.
