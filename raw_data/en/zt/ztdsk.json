Her main concern is that vaccines have been linked to autism and other health problems. There are multiple articles circulating the internet alerting parents of possible side effects of vaccinations; some even claiming to have scientific proof to support their claims. Vaccinations have been repeatedly demonstrated to be one of the most effective interventions to prevent disease worldwide. It was voted by readers of the British Medical Journal in 2007 as one of the four most important developments in medicine of the past 150 years, alongside sanitation, antibiotics and anaesthesia. However, vaccination currently saves an estimated three million lives per year throughout the world and so topped the list in terms of lives saved, making it one of the most cost-effective health interventions available. Modern vaccines provide high levels of protection against an increasing number of diseases and the symptoms, disability and death that can occur from them. Vaccines have been used to prevent diseases for centuries, and have saved countless lives of children and adults. The smallpox vaccine was invented as early as 1796, and since then the use of vaccines has continued to protect us from countless life threatening diseases such as polio, measles, and pertussis. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (2010) assures that vaccines are extensively tested by scientist to make sure they are effective and safe, and must receive the approval of the Food and Drug Administration before being used. \"Perhaps the greatest success story in public health is the reduction of infectious diseases due to the use of vaccines\" (CDC, 2010). Routine immunization has eliminated smallpox from the globe and Mandatory vaccination continues to be a contentious subject in the United States, even though extensive evidence proves inoculation prevents certain diseases. According to A. Plotkin & L. Plotkin (2011), the evolution of the first vaccine commenced in the 1700's when a physician named Edwards Jenner discovered that cowpox protected According to American historian, David Oshinsky of the Wall Street Journal, \"the controversy over vaccines is as old as the vaccination itself.\" While both sides of the immunization controversy have gathered ample sources backing their claims throughout the duration of this controversy, the validity of the two sides couldn't contrast Autism is being linked to early vaccinations to illnesses, and by doing so may cause children as their body is developing serious complications. Though the topic is still up to debate there have been numerous accounts of children obtaining autistic effects shorty after being immunized from illnesses such as the meals, mumps, and chicken pox. One such account Came Parsippany New Jersey, the parents of a 15 month year old toddler had just been to the clinic to vaccinate their child against the illness of the measles. Following the weeks after the child though fine before the vaccination in the year of 1986 started to show signs of different behavior and was having trouble communicating, by 1989 three years after his treatment he was diagnosed with autism. Now this may be just another short story to stop vaccinations but it's backed by many of the same cases. Where autism comes from is unknown and many believe it to be a genetic defect Vaccinations were first introduced in the late 18th century by Edward Jenner. He injected a small amount of cowpox in a thirteen year-old boy to demonstrate the effectiveness it had against smallpox, resulting in the development of the first smallpox vaccine in 1798. Because of his discovery, Jenner contributed to the overall annihilation of the disease in 1979 after the vaccine was implemented in different medicines throughout the world (source). Following Jenner, many others produced vaccines to help reduce the fatalities of common diseases such as measles, polio, and rubella, which were once responsible for millions of deaths every year. Now, there is almost no risk of catching these fatal illnesses. Vaccinations are considered to be one of the greatest medical advancements of our time. The first vaccine was created in 1796 and many more have been created since. These deadly diseases such as smallpox, polio, and diphtheria are now being prevented. Since vaccines have been doing their job, we do not see them around anymore. The media is now displaying vaccines in a negative way and people are listening to the misconstrued knowledge. Parents are worried about the risks associated with the vaccines instead of the diseases they are preventing. They believe there may be a link between vaccines and the development of autism. Parents also believe there is an issue with the current immunization schedule. They believe that the children are getting too many vaccines at one time and this might cause other health related problems. This does not only affect the child who is not being vaccinated, it is a danger to children who cannot receive the vaccine due to weakened immune systems or other health related problems. The CDC states that there is no connection between vaccinations and autism. They also state that the immunization schedule is safe. Since more and more children are not being vaccinated, this might cause a global health epidemic in the future. These deadly diseases that were prevented from vaccines may reappear. It is important for health care workers to be up to date on the scientific facts regarding vaccinations so they can provide parents with accurate knowledge. Many diseases have seen tremendously reduced cases since the synthesizing of their vaccinations. For instance, \"More than 15,000 Americans died from diphtheria in 1921, before there was a vaccine. Only one case of diphtheria has been reported to CDC since 2004\" (CDC.gov). Another example of this is \"An epidemic of rubella (German measles) in 1964-65 infected 12\u00bd million Americans, killed 2,000 babies, and caused 11,000 miscarriages. In 2012, 9 cases of rubella were reported to CDC\" (CDC.gov). Vaccines are constantly being developed to help save lives from disease, and so far have saved millions of lives all over the world. Tetanus, mumps, and measles shots are major examples of life saving vaccines; death rates due to these diseases have decreased dramatically since their The discovery all began in 1796 when Edward Jenner decided to test a local theory that if a person contracted cowpox they were immune to smallpox. Cowpox is a very similar disease, but is generally found in animals. It can however be contracted by farmers and others close to the sick animal. \"Jenner extracted pus from a cowpox scab and inserted it into an incision on the arm of an eight-year-old boy. Although the child contracted a mild virus, he recovered quickly, developing antibodies that built up his immunity to both cowpox and smallpox\" (The Feverish Roots). From that he shared his findings and vaccinations were born and are still used today. With the use of vaccinations there comes great benefits. \"In a 2005 study on the economic impact of routine childhood immunization in the United States, researchers estimated that for every dollar spent, the vaccination program saved more than $5 in direct costs and approximately $11 in additional costs to society\" (Vaccines). Instead of putting people through lots of trouble and hard times when they get ill. It is easier and better for society to be protected by having everyone vaccinated in the first place. \"Vaccines protect not only yourself but also others around you\" (Vaccines). Because of vaccinations the following illnesses have been completely eliminated if not all then at a large One of the things that was surprising for me during my week doing the hours was while I was at the vaccination clinic at the hospital. I was about to leave but the nurse need it to see one more patient before taking me to the blood bank. It was It is perceived to be a social standard in society to uphold high beliefs in vaccinations. Medical professionals as well as historic scientific research support the progression of immunization and its historical triumph against infection and disease. For example, English physician Edward Jenner pioneered the smallpox vaccine, which opened the doors for more ventures into the world of vaccinations. Due to the advancement in technology of the 21st century, we are able to address more diseases and create new components for vaccines to help find innovative ways to distribute them and test effectiveness. The progress in science has always been the driving force for the development and improvement of an effective vaccine. With the second golden age For many years ago, children had suffered deadly diseases. Diseases like rubella, measles, diphtheria, smallpox, whooping cough and polio were to a certain point in time, deemed incurable. Since the evolution of vaccines, these diseases have been largely prevented, and many children's lives were saved. Controversy over Vaccines In 1998 on February28, Andrew Wakefield published his study about vaccines causing autism. Brian Deer investigated this study and found the data was manipulated and Wakefield was paid to do it. Jenny McCarthy has a son named Evan and claims, \"It wasn't until after the MMR [measles, mumps, First, studies and research have shown that vaccinations are not connected to autism. The only connection between vaccines and autism is age. Parents naturally think vaccinations have something to do with their child developing autism, and they tend to look towards recent events that happened in their child's life as the cause. Vaccines are usually seen as the cause of autism because vaccinations are received at the age when children develop autism, so many parents wrongly connect the two. One of the main reasons parents are scared to give their children vaccinations is because of a false statement made by Dr. Andrew Wakefield. It was about the vaccination given to prevent measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR). In 1988, it was falsely stated by Dr. Wakefield in the Lancet that the "}
