MYIBS is a mixed- method study including a randomised controlled trial and semistructured interviews. The primary aim of this randomised controlled trial is to determine the effects of an 8-week virtual yoga intervention on IBS symptom severity, measured with the IBS Symptoms Severity Scale, compared with an advice-only control group. Secondary aims are to determine whether (1) a yoga programme delivered virtually is feasible for adults with IBS, (2) improves health outcomes including quality of life (QOL), stress and fatigue and (3) improves mental health outcomes including depression and anxiety symptoms. An embedded design experimental model qualitative substudy using semistructured interviews will explore and describe participants' experiences in the yoga programme, and its impact. We hypothesise that the programme will be feasible and effective in improving outcomes in the intervention group compared with the control group. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Study design overview The quantitative study is a superiority randomised non- blinded two-group controlled trial. The qualitative study will use semistructured interviews and thematic analysis to explore and describe intervention participant experi- ences and views of the yoga programme. Patient involvement Patients with lived experience were involved in the conduct of this study. During the development stage, patient partners were invited to participate in a series of discus- sions with the research team to define the study research question, study design, choice of outcome measures and methods of recruitment. Following the completion of the trial, the patient partners will be involved in the dissemi- nation of this research. Sample and selection The MYIBS study will be conducted at the University of Calgary in Alberta, Canada starting March 2021 and ending early 2022. To be eligible in this study, partici- pants must be diagnosed with IBS based on Rome IV criteria by a healthcare professional (eg, physician, nurse, dietician), be 18-70 years old, have an adequate under- standing of English, have an ability to provide written informed consent, score at least 75 out 500 points on the IBS Symptoms Severity Scale indicating mild IBS symptoms, and be on stable doses of medications for IBS (including antidepressants) without major changes to diet or physical activity levels for at least 8 weeks prior to starting the intervention. Individuals across Canada are eligible to participate. Exclusion criteria include a major physical impairment that would prevent the individual from doing yoga determined by either the patient or the study coordinator, and diagnosis of any major cognitive, psychological or psychiatric disorder (eg, major depres- sion, schizophrenia) as identified by the treating physi- cian or healthcare practitioner or screened by the study coordinator using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Participants will be identified through (1) gastroenter- ology clinics across Calgary, Alberta; (2) gastroenterolo- gists across Canada who indicated interest in this study for their patients with IBS in a previous survey conducted by our team (not published); (3) participants from the previous survey who indicated interest in this study and have given consent to be contacted; (4) through social media; (5) selfreferrals through the study website and the University of Calgary participate in research portal; (6) Canadian Association of Gastroenterologists monthly newsletter; and (7) participants with IBS who are enrolled in the Inflammation, Microbiome and Alimen- tation Gastro-intestinal and Neuropsychiatric Effects (IMAGINE) cohort study at the University of Calgary and have given their consent to be contacted for future studies. Participant screening will use the PHQ-9. Individuals who score 20 points or higher on the PHQ-9 indicating severe depression will not be eligible to participate. Reasons for exclusion are lack of compliance in inter ventional studies among these individuals, potential heterogeneity in the small sample size of participants and skewed results if patients seek treatment for their depres- sion during the trial. interventions Yoga intervention group Before their first class, the intervention group will receive an introductory video. The video will consist of informa- tion on IBS, information on the style of yoga they will be learning, and rationale for yogaas a treatment for IBS. The intervention will be delivered online by a certified yoga facilitator in class sizes of less than 10 participants using the Microsoft Office Teams platform. Classes will be held once per week for the 8-week duration. The first session will be approximately 90min and subsequent sessions up to 60min. The introductory session will include the class setup, introductions, teaching poses, corrections and a question and answers period. The yoga facilitator will provide participants with modifications for common challenges to support best practices and ensure safety. Subsequent classes will include a review from the previous week, a question and answer period, individual correc- tions and modifications and introduce new practices. In addition to the online class component, study staff will ask participants to practice the yoga programme at home every day. They will also have access to the yoga videos, written programme instructions and frequently answered questions accessible through the study website to help 2 D'Silva A, et al.

Doing these practices everyday can relieve muscle and joint stiffness and reduce pain over time. This practice is recommended by the Isha Foundation to increase strengths and flexibility in preparation for Yoga Namaskar. Neck practices There are five sets of neck practices, each stretching the The main cause of neck pain is usually muscle tension.

This practice activates the lumbar region of the spine and strengthens the spinal muscles.*\"While Yoga Namaskar has not been specifically studied in patients with IBS, yoga squatting postures have been associated with significant decrease in depression among nine individuals with IBD\u00ae\u00b0 and anxiety in a randomised self as control study in 30 healthy subjects.\u00b0? Yoga This practice involves a series of seven consecutive Namaskar steps of upper body stretching and squatting, aligned with breath.

Upa Yoga, developed by the Isha of Inner Sciences (https:/ /isha.sadhguru.org/us/en), will be promoted. Upa Yoga maintains the ancient principles of Hatha Yoga and will be delivered by a certified yoga facilitator from the Isha Foundation. The Upa Yoga programme will consist of (1) directional movements and neck rotations, (2) hatha yoga-based Yoga Namaskar, (3) breathing practices or alternate nostril breathing, (4) mantra meditation consisting of AUM chanting (OM) and (5) breath watching. Table 1 shows a description of the programme and rationale. Our published prospective study examining the effectiveness of Upa Yoga in patients with inflammatory bowel disease\" shows improvements in mental health scores after an 8-week yoga programme. Advice-only control group Control participants will receive a video including general education on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), the mind- gut connection in IBS, and the role of mind-body ther- apies in the management of IBS. These participants will also receive a list of IBS-related resources from the Cana- dian Digestive Health Foundation, a link to a patient with IBS support group (www.ibspatient.org), and information prospective study. 35 36 This mantra is thought to facilitate energy flow, and through vibratory mechanisms, creates peace and harmony leading to increased mental alertness and may improve symptoms of depression.3? 38 Breathing in a focused manner can be used as a tool to promote positive changes to the mind, body and emotions.* Significant reduction in the level of state anxiety was found in a group of healthy male volunteers when they practised breath awareness.*\u00a3 about physical activity guidelines from the WHO. Control participants will be eligible to attend a 2-week yoga programme and receive the yoga videos 8weeks from the time of enrolment. Data on these participants will not be collected as this participation option is for participants who desire to receive the yoga sessions outside of the study. Outcome measures Feasibility outcomes Recruitment, attendance and aitrition rates Recruitment will be calculated by the percentage of partic- ipants who complete the eligibility and enrollment phases of the study. Attrition will be calculated by the percentage of participants who complete all study measures at base- line and 8 weeks. A feasible intervention will be defined as class attendance of at least 75% (ie, attendance in 6 out of 8 classes)? and attrition rate of less than 30%. Adherence Adherence will be defined as practicing daily yoga for at least 80% of days for 8weeks (or 45 out of 56 days minimum). Each week a practice log will be provided to monitor frequency and length of yoga. The yoga facili- tator will take attendance during each online class. To increase programme adherence, the study coordinator D'Silva A, et al. on nananana will email intervention participants weekly. Six months following the completion of the intervention, participants will be asked to report the average frequency (ie, days per month) and duration (ie, minutes) of their yoga practices over the last 7 days to evaluate long-term maintenance. Programme satisfaction Intervention participants will complete a survey regarding overall satisfaction with their programme, including satis- faction with videos and online class instruction. Videos and online classes will be deemed acceptable if at least 70% of participants are at least satisfied (ie, rank classes as either good, great or excellent). Participants will also indi- cate whether they would recommend the programme to others on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree) and provide feedback on how the programme could be improved. Assessment of harms The study coordinator will screen potential participants and exclude those with any physical problems that may limit participation with yoga postures. Participants will be asked to report any adverse events experienced during the study period. Participants with adverse events (eg, injury resulting from the programme) will be advised to consult their physician to provide care as appropriate. Effectiveness outcomes The primary outcome, IBS symptoms, will be measured using the IBS-Symptom Severity Scale (IBS-SSS). The IBS-SSS is a five-question survey that asks the severity of abdominal pain, frequency of abdominal pain, severity of abdominal distention, dissatisfaction with bowel habits and inter- ference with QOL over the past 10 days. Scores on the IBS-SSS range from 0 to 500 with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. Participants can be categorised as having mild (75-175), moderate (175-300) or severe (>300) IBS. Symptom reduction of at least 50 points is considered clinically meaningful. Secondary outcomes (and their measures) include QOL (IBSQOL), anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disor- der-7), depression (PHQ-9), stress (Perceived Stress Scale), COVID-19 stress (COVID-19 Stress Scale), fatigue (Modified Fatigue Impact Scale-21), somatic Symptoms (PHQ-15) and self-compassion (Self Compassion Scale-Short Form) (lonline supplemental table 1). Intention to practice yoga will also be assessed. The intervention and control groups will be assessed on effectiveness outcomes at baseline, 4 and 8weeks. The intervention group will complete measures of effectiveness outcomes 6 months after the intervention. Sample size We will recruit 25 participants per group. However, assuming 30% attrition rate, we will aim to recruit 33 participants per group. Symptom reduction of at least 50 points is considered clinically meaningful; however, a group difference has been shown to represent a consid- erable self-reported improvement.\" We calculated the Identification of potential participants oe Participants assessed for eligibility Lu) AAA = | Baseline assessment | (following written informed consent) _) | Random allocation 1:1 | A.

The study coordinator will obtain consent from participants who will then be enrolled in the study. Participants will be randomised after baseline assessment to either the yoga intervention or the advice-only control group. A statistician blinded to the randomisation key will create a computer-generated REDCap randomised sequence to allocate participants male:female:other) and depres- sion (1:1 depression:no depression). Participants will be aware of the group to which they are allocated; however, the principal investigator and data analyst will remain blinded to the randomisation process. Data management All quantitative data will be entered into a secure REDCap database at the University of Calgary. Effective- ness outcome measures, programme satisfaction, atten- dance and adherence will be entered by the participants. Recruitment, attrition and safety will be recorded by the study coordinator who is not blinded to the randomisa- tion. After the study, data will be downloaded, and patient identifiers will be removed from the data file. Data will be stored in a password-protected file on a University of Calgary password-protected computer. The interviews will be transcribed, deidentified and uploaded to the Univer- sity of Calgary's secure SharePoint site. Only the research team will have access to the data. Statistical analysis Descriptive analysis will summarise participant charac- teristics and feasibility outcomes. Univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) will examine baseline differences between groups for variables with continuous data. x? tests will examine baseline differences between groups for categorical variables. Unadjusted ANOVA and 4 D'Silva A, et al. BMJ adjusted analysis of covariance models will compare differences in scores from baseline and postintervention data within and between groups using intent to treat and per-protocol analysis. A logistic regression\u2014model exam- ining determinants of responders (a minimum improve- ment of at least 50 points on the IBS-SSS scale) versus non-responders will be developed to predict a response to the intervention. This model will consider practice in minutes, baseline depression, anxiety and IBS symptom severity scores. An 0 of 0.05 will be the threshold for determining statistical significance. If the frequency of missing data is >5%, we will perform additional analyses using imputation methods. Analysis will be conducted using SPSS V.26. Postintervention interviews Participants who were randomised to the intervention and did not withdraw from the study will be invited by email to participate in an interview. We aim to recruit men and women and have equal representation of those who benefited from the programme (ie, experienced improvements in their IBS symptom severity) as well as individuals who did not. We anticipate needing to inter- view between 10 and 15 participants to reach both code and meaning saturation\" aiming for a maximum varia- tion sample. Semistructured interviews will capture participants' experiences, programme satisfaction, facilitators and barriers to participation, perceptions of social support and supervised learning, perceived impact on IBS symp- toms and overall physical and mental health, and input on improving future programming (box 1). Interviews will happen virtually using Microsoft Office Teams and be approximately 30-45 min in length. The study coor- dinator will interview the participants, take notes during the interview and reflect following each interview. Inter- view recordings will be transcribed verbatim without iden- tifying information. Data will be coded and analysed in duplicate using NVivo V.12. Thematic analysis inductively reveals patterns and themes providing an understanding of participant experiences, with the programme and their perspectives on its impact. Thematic analysis is a method for systematically identifying, organising and offering insight into patterns of meaning (themes) across a data set. This method makes sense of shared meanings and experiences that allows the researcher to identify what data are important to the research question.\" DISCUSSION The MY-IBS study aims to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of an 8-week virtual yoga and meditation programme combined with home-based practice for patients with IBS. Determining feasibility will be based on study recruitment, adherence, safety and programme satisfaction. Improved IBS symptom management (the primary outcome) will determine intervention effective- ness. Secondary outcomes include QOL, Semistructured interview questions and probes 1.

These findings will inform potential predictors of responders versus non-responders. Predic- tors may be considered in clinical practice to target the patients with IBS most likely to benefit from the yoga intervention. Interview themes and patterns will refine and inform the development of future virtual yoga programming designed for patients with IBS. To our knowledge, there are no studies of virtual yoga and meditation in the IBS population. The findings from this study may have implications for the manage- ment of IBS. The virtual delivery of yoga represents an opportunity to increase access to effective management therapies for patients with IBS. The COVID-19 pandemic has called for the reorganisation of healthcare including utilisation of virtual care. Nearly 90% of care in the USA has been delivered virtually since the pandemic.\" Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is increased psycholog- ical distress and gosmolneesental symptoms among indi- viduals with 1BS% 2 compared with individuals without IBS.\" The present study offers a unique opportunity to examine prospectively the feasibility and effectiveness of a yoga and meditation programme delivered virtually to individuals living with IBS with the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions taken into consideration. Study findings may aid in developing interventions and services tailored to patients with IBS. New insight into outcomes will be bene- ficial for healthcare leaders in planning how to allocate existing resources to support these services and poten- tially lessen the burden of IBS on both the individual and the healthcare system. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethics The study protocol, informed consent form and other study documents were reviewed and approved by the University of Calgary's ethics board. All protocol modifi- cations will be submitted for review and approval by the ethics board. The trial participants will be informed of any modifications, and reconsented by the study coordi- nator, if required. Further, the trial registry for this study will be updated. Participation is voluntary and will not influence stan- dard clinical care. All participants will provide informed written consent and have the right to withdraw from the study at any time. Pending consent from the participant, all data collected up to the time of withdrawal will be used in the final data analyses as advised by the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines.\" Dissemination Our targeted knowledge users and audiences will include researchers, healthcare professionals and service providers, persons with lived experiences, community groups and professional organisations (eg, Canadian Association of Gastroenterology). Our goal will be to increase topic area knowledge among these groups and inform future research.
