It provides a safe and natural alternative to surgery and even botox. Through a combination of natural herbs and specifically placed needles, we are able to increase the muscle tone around the face to help you look and feel younger and healthier. The treatment is twofold. In addition to working directly on the face, acupuncture is also performed to enhance the body's constitution to improve your health from the inside to out. We believe in the beauty of the natural skin glow so after our session we will not apply any lotion or product on your skin. All the products we use during the session are made from natural ingredients with no preservatives or chemicals. If you have any specific skin allergies, please mention this during your initial consultation. "}
