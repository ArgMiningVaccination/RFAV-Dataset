Principles of Naturopathic Medicine The Healing Power of Nature The healing process is ordered and intelligent. The body has the inherent ability, vitality, to not only heal itself and restore health but also to ward off disease. Illness is not caused simply by an invasion of external agents or germs but is a manifestation of the organism's attempt to defend and heal itself. The Naturopathic Physicians role is to identify and remove agents blocking the healing process, bolster the patient's healing capacity and support the creation of a healthy internal and external environment. Treat the Whole Person Identify and Treat the Cause Naturopathic Medicine seeks to identify and remove the underlying causes of illness, rather than to suppress symptoms. Illness does not occur without cause and symptoms (nausea, rash, headache) are not the cause of illness. Symptoms are signals that the body is out of balance and are an expression of the body's attempt to heal itself. Causes originate on many levels but are often found in the patient's lifestyle, diet, habits, or emotional state. When only the symptoms are treated, the underlying causes remain, and the patient may develop a more serious, chronic condition. First, Do No Harm Respecting the inherent ability of the organism to heal itself, the physician must be ever mindful of the consequences or side effects of treatment. The more gentle and non-invasive the therapy, the less disruptive it will be to the patient's integral whole. Whenever possible, suppression of symptoms is avoided, as suppression may interfere with the healing process. Doctor as Teacher The original meaning of the word \"doctor\" was \"teacher.\" A physician is a facilitator for a patient's healing process. One of the physician's principal responsibilities is to educate the patient and encourage self-responsibility for health. A cooperative doctor-patient relationship has inherent therapeutic value. Prevention Health is a reflection of how we choose to live. Physicians help patients recognize their choices and how those choices affect their health. The physician assesses risk factors and hereditary susceptibility to disease and makes appropriate intervention to prevent illness. "}
