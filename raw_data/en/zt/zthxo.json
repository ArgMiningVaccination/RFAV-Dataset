There are cats and dogs that are eternally scratching, with hot spots of raw flesh on their bodies. Some have lost their hair or have other severe reactions to flea bites and ear mites. They burp a lot, expel gas, have a rumbling tummy or loose stool. They carry or suffer from potentially deadly viruses, chronic diarrhea, vomiting, epileptic seizures, chronic liver or pancreatic disease, kidney ailments, hyperactivity or lethargy. ''These animals have become sickly before their time. They represent the tip of a massive, uncharted iceberg, an epidemic of disease that is not yet fully recognized by the veterinary medical profession. At this very time, millions of our domestic pets are going down like the Titanic and will continue to do so unless we take steps to avert what I consider a very real and growing disaster,'' says Plechner, author of ''Pet Allergies, Remedies for an Epidemic'' (Very Healthy Enterprises Inc., Box 4728, Inglewood, Calif., 90309; $8.45 including shipping). The problem is twofold, Plechner says. Cause No. 1 is flawed food. Cause No. 2 is genetic defects. ''Over the last 30 or 40 years, there has been a proliferation of improperly designed commercial pet food. It is typically filled with poor quality ingredients and chemical additives and bears little resemblance to food created by Mother Nature,'' he says. He quotes James Corbin, a professor of animal science at the University of Illinois, in citing some of the more unheralded ingredients used in cheap canned foods. The list includes: ''gristle, hair, lungs, pig feet, pig snouts, tails, cheeks, udders and condemned hog livers.'' Processed feathers, beaks, hooves, horns and diseased tissues can also find their way into some foods under the label of poultry or beef ''by-products,'' Plechner says. ''Minimum daily nutritional requirements may be met by some products, but they are just that-minimums,'' he says. DEFECTIVE BREEDING ''Similarly, over the last 50 years or more, intensive breeding for particular physical features has created seriously defective animals with impaired ability to tolerate their environments. ''Widespread cosmetic-oriented breeding is also producing hormonally defective animals unable to adequately defend themselves against allergens, microorganisms and disease.'' He says animals should be tested for proper hormonal balance before they are used for breeding. Defective animals should not be used, he says. ''These two elements, poor food and genetic defects, have created an allergy disease ravaging our pet population,'' Plechner says. Plechner, a 1966 graduate of the University of California at Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, practices in West Los Angeles. Over the years of his practice, Plechner developed a special interest in nutrition, allergy and the relationship of the endocrine system to small-animal diseases. He gives pet owners practical ways in which to make wise choices for their pets in feeding and managing their health. He describes commercial dry food as ''a sackful of trouble'' and semi-moist foods as ''a horror story-the ultimate food fiction, tinted, flavored and processed with a genuine Hollywood flair for special effects.'' His ''hit'' list of the most allergy-provoking foods includes ''beef, tuna, milk, eggs, brewers yeast, wheat, corn and chemical additives, items found in many commercial pet food formulations.'' RELIEF FROM MAJOR ILLS He describes how to use diet and nutritional supplements to prevent and heal illness. He offers new ideas for veterinarians, for the relief of feline leukemia, feline infectious peritonitis, flea allergies, nagging skin problems and other major conditions. His basic theory is to toughen up the immune system so parasites, viruses and bacteria won`t find your pet such a welcome host. Plechner collaborated with a California food manufacturer, Jeffrey Bennett, to design a number of hypoallergenic diets for dogs and cats. The dog kibble is based on New Zealand-grown lamb and rice, the dry cat food on chicken and lamb, the canned cat food on organ meats. Called Nature`s Recipe, it is highly palatable to pets and should be available through select veterinarians, feed stores and pet shops within 90 days. Plechner`s book also has homemade recipes, including a vegetarian one, that he has used to treat hundreds of dogs and cats at his clinic. He advises keeping the animal on any program of medication but eliminating chew sticks, vitamins, biscuits or snacks, as any one of these items could cause allergic reactions. He suggests not overloading your animal`s digestive tract with one large meal; feed two or three times daily. While he finds vitamin therapies disappointing, he does recommend that clients give their animals a mineral supplement. Many animals have enzyme deficiencies that prevent proper absorption of nutrients. So combined with the hypoallergenic diet and trace mineral supplement, he advises having your pet tested for trypsin deficiency, done with a sample of the animal`s stool. If it is deficient, an enzyme supplement is recommended. One chapter of Plechner`s book is devoted to how hormone deficiencies in pets can be detected, and how steroids and hormones such as cortisol, estrogen and thyroid can be effectively and safely applied for prevention and treatment of serious disease. The above is a chapter essentially for the veterinarian, containing technical information on how blood tests can reveal irregularities and treatment of the endocrine-immune imbalances. AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH ''The battery of tests runs about $160, depending on where you are geographically,'' says Dr. Keith Nicol of Sorrento Animal Hospital in Portland, Ore., who says of Plechner`s method: ''It`s another alternative. He certainly has opened my eyes in some areas. I am more adamant about putting dogs on hypoallergenic diets, and I`ve seen some good results.'' Plechner`s method has not had the exposure here among local veterinarians as it has in California. Some West Coast veterinarians, such as Dr. Donald McCoy of North Portland Animal Clinic in Oregon, have tried Plechner`s method and ''found it useful.'' Dr. William Callahan of LaCumbre Animal Hospital in Santa Barbara, Calif., says he thinks it ''is a valuable tool. I haven`t read his book, but I have talked to him, and I use several of his ideas for treatment, especially for skin and allergy problems.'' Dr. Carvel Tiekert, president and founder of the American Holistic Veterinary Medical Association, who practices at the Animal Clinic of Harford County in Bel Air, Md., says Plechner ''has a lot of information in his book. I have a little bit different program; I prefer to try not using those heavy doses of cortisone, and I`ve been successful. But that`s what the essence of holism is; we all do it a little bit differently.'' Plechner admits most mainstream veterinarians ''don`t think too much'' of his program. ''The profession is not into this. They don`t know about it. We (as a profession) describe and treat effects, we don`t deal with the causes. Plechner maintains a wildlife refuge in the Santa Monica Mountains, providing free treatment for injured wild animals brought in by government agencies and concerned citizens. The facility is licensed by both the U.S. Department of Interior Fish and Wildlife Service and the California State Department of Fish and Game. Proceeds from book sales are being used to help sustain and expand this unique treatment center. - "}
