To help control the pain and inflammation I was ingesting significant quantities of prescription medications. Although these meds were essential for me to function they were caustic to my body and over time they would tax my liver. After a year of Dr. Frigerio's help, I am pain free and have reduced my medicine intake by 75% with the intention of reducing it further. The results have been so dramatic my rheumatologist has congratulated me. I have found Dr. Frigerio's methods to be more effective than \"traditional\" medicine, but the changes are subtler. Be patient and your patience will be rewarded.\" Natural Journal Expert advice and in-depth features for a healthy life "}
