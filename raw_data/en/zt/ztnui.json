Vitamin A plays an important role in the protection of the epithelial tissues (including retina and skin) and the mucous membranes and therefore as a protection against general infections. Vitamin D3 takes care for a regular process of the calcium-phosphorous metabolism. Vitamin E plays an important role in protecting the stability of vitamin A and in general as an anti-oxidant. The B-vitamins participate in the formation of enzymes and are indispensable for the metabolism of fats, proteins and carbohydrates and for normal growth of muscular and nervous tissues. The deficiency of only one vitamin is rarely encountered. However, even in such cases it is advisable to administer the whole complex in order to prevent a possible deficiency of other vitamins. After intramuscular injection, the vitamins are quickly and completely absorbed and a rapid therapeutic effect is attained in vitamin deficiencies.
