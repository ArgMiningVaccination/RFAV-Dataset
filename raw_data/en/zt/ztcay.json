Understanding the Role of Nutrition and Wound Healing. Nutrition in Clinical Practice, 25(1), 61-68. doi:10.1177/0884533609358997 Wound management is one of the cornerstones for nursing care however, effective wound care extends far beyond the application of the wound itself. Nurses may be required to assess, plan, implement, and evaluate wound care; therefore, order to fill these roles it's critical to have an understanding of the several different areas of wound care such as, integumentary system, classification of wounds, wound procedures, and documentation. Knowledge in each of these areas will allow nurses to make well informed decisions about wound care, and as a result play an active part in wound healing. Skin repair is an important physiological process which is essential for homeostasis, restoring barrier function and preventing infection (Martin, 2009; Boateng and Catanzano, 2015). Wound healing is defined as a complex, dynamic and the specific biological process associated with the phenomena of tissue regeneration and growth (Mazumder et al., 2016). Regeneration can be defined as a tissue that significantly damaged either completely or partially removed and tissue's original function and cell types must be functional and structurally restored (Mazumder et al., 2016). The process of healing comprises a cytokine, blood cells, extracellular matrix and growth factor (Joao De Masi et al., 2016). The growth factor is a protein that activates and Introduction. This report will discuss the risk of impaired wound healing, amongst patients in the community. Patients may be at risk due to increased age, malnutrition and underlying medical conditions (Timmons, 2003, White, 2008). However, this report concerns with patients' knowledge deficit about the importance of nutrition, which may be the Pressure ulcers are a secondary health condition for spinal cord injury patients. The prevalence for pressure ulcers for spinal cord injury patients can reach up to 95% and for many it can be a recurrent problem. The article that I have chosen to review sets out to compare ultraviolet-C versus Proliferative phase occurs within a few days of injury in which cells that were involved in the battle need to tend to their wounds and the regenerate to restore itself to its formal glory as best as possible. The body's way of restoring itself is through use of angiogenesis, granulation tissue formation, wound contraction and epithelialization. This combination acts of getting new blood vessels to the damage area, aid in the formation of cells to fill in the area which leads to scar tissue, allow the skin to flexible in the repair process and finally resurface the wound with new epithelial Patients at Long Term Care Facilities are generally debilitated and elderly people who have incontinence problems. Incontinence makes treating pressure ulcers very difficult because it alters tissue tolerance and reapplying products becomes very costly. Usually negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is used to treat pressure ulcers but it is also very costly and does not match with some wound locations. Collagen plays a vital role in the wound healing process by creating a framework for the adhesion, movement, and production of new cells. This study determined the effects and uses of Type 1 formulated collagen on granulation tissue formation and reepithreelialization in chronic pressure ulcers. Integra is a synthetic wound dressing frequently used to treat burn wounds (Figure 5). It is a bilayer composed of bovine tendon collagen glycosaminoglycan (chondroitin-6-sulphate) cross-linked to it, onto which a silicone (synthetic polysiloxane polymer) membrane is sealed to the upper surface to act as a protective temporary epidermis. The silicone layer is applied as a liquid monomer; curing occurs on the surface of the collagen at room temperature. It serves to control moisture loss from the wound. Water flux across this silicone membrane is the same as that across normal epidermis. The collagen-GAG matrix contains pores ranging from 70 to 200 \u00b5m that are invaded by host fibroblasts upon application to an excised wound bed. The pore size was carefully designed by adjusting the collagen-GAG mixture. In GAG-free collagen, the resulting structure was more closed than in collagen-GAG matrices. Smaller pores can delay, or even prevent, biointegration, whereas larger pores would provide an insufficient attachment area for invading host cells. Freeze-drying procedures followed by slow sublimation are used to control pore size too. The degradation rate of 30 days of the collagen-GAG sponge is controlled by glutaraldehyde-induced cross-links. The polypeptide collagen is used for its low levels of antigenicity (it has minimal rejection potential) and because it exerts a hemostatic effect on vascular wounds. Collagen is already found in skin. It is degraded by collagenase deposited Research Critique This paper will be a research critique on the article \"Frequent Application of the New Gelatin-Collagen Nonwoven Accelerates Wound Healing\", by Schiefer, J.L. and Rath, R, and each section will be examined using our textbook \"Understanding Evidence-Based Practice\". The article's main focus was on determining the effect of healing when using multiple collagen nonwoven applications to chronic wounds. Twelve mini-pigs where used to test this technique and the findings indicated that this method was promising, because the wounds had a faster healing rate when multiple application of gelatin-collagen nonwoven was used as treatment. Analyzing the articles components, we can see that although it does contain preliminary The number of people with diabetes is greatly increasing around the world. A large percentage of this population can be expected to develop diabetic foot ulcers. During the mid-19th century the problem of diabetic foot ulcers was discovered and discussed for the first time (Naves, 2016). In the mid-19th century, Today, despite precise surgical techniques to cut out dying tissue, artificial skin and other high-tech treatments, hard-to-heal wounds remain a huge problem. Diabetic foot ulcers alone strike about 600,000 people annually and lead to thousands of Pressure ulcers are a secondary health condition of spinal cord injury patients. The prevalence of pressure ulcers for spinal cord injury patients can reach up to 95% and for many it can be a recurrent problem. The article that I have chosen to review sets out to compare ultraviolet-C To test for wound healing, excision wounds were created on THE exposed mice. The wound tissues were collected at various time intervals for 14 days after the injury. Looking at RNA concentration and using a spectrophotometer, the changes of expression level between exposed and non-exposed wound tissue were compared. Wound infection especially open wounds can become a serious problem especially for individuals with compromised immune systems such as Diabetes Mellitus, people who do not seek medical treatment In order for Mr Jones' wound to heal, his nutritional status would need to be improved as part of his nursing care. An array of authors have noted that protein in particular is essential in wound healing. Lewis and Harding (1993), state that protein is like a building block in the process of constructing the wound bed. They also note that malnourishment of protein prolongs the inflammatory phase of wound "}
