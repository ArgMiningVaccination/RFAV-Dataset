Learn more about recovery in hospital, at home and where you can get further support.", "sitename": "British Heart Foundation", "date": "2023-01-01", "cleaned_text": "It can take a while to come to terms with having a [heart attack](/informationsupport/conditions/heart-attack), but everyone is different. For some people, their recovery will be quick. For others, it may take longer. Some people worry about having another heart attack, or not being able to do as much as before. Try not to think too far ahead. Many people make a full recovery. It just takes time. You may have times when you feel well, followed by days when you feel less well. This is normal and it's important not to be too hard on yourself. Heart attack recovery in hospital After receiving treatment, you'll usually be in hospital for a few days. The length of your stay will depend on what treatment you've had and how well you begin to recover. - If you've had [coronary angioplasty or stents](/informationsupport/treatments/coronary-angioplasty-and-stents), it's likely to be two or three days. - If you've had [coronary bypass surgery](/informationsupport/treatments/coronary-bypass-surgery), it's likely to be about a week. During your stay, you'll be monitored and have tests to see how well your heart is recovering. When you first arrive in hospital, you'll likely be admitted to a coronary care unit (CCU). During your stay, you might be moved to a cardiac ward. You won't be discharged from hospital until your doctor is certain you're well enough to go home. Heart attack recovery at home You should take it easy early on, gradually building up how much you do. Try to get up, wash and get dressed, even if you don't feel like doing so. Do some light household activities like making a hot drink, or get back into the habit of doing the usual things like the washing up. Keep active by going up and down stairs, walking around the house or by going for a short walk. These small activities might make you feel tired or groggy at first but keep going. If they make you feel very unwell, contact your GP or cardiac rehab nurse if you're already in touch with them. If you've had a stent inserted it's common to experience a 'settling down' discomfort which may feel similar to the pain you had at the time of the heart attack. If you get chest pain: - use your GTN spray as prescribed - if the pain doesn't stop after using the spray twice, or within a few minutes, call 999 for an ambulance. You might find it helpful to have someone stay with you for the first few days or weeks once you return home. They can give you a hand around the house and help you build your confidence. Although your loved ones might be tempted to 'wrap you in cotton wool', it's important you are as independent as possible. Remember to: - Take your hospital discharge letter to your GP or ask a loved one to do it. This is so the GP knows about your heart attack and the treatment you've had. - Make an appointment to see your GP within the first couple of weeks of being home so that you can get a repeat prescription for your medicines. - Take your medication at the correct times. - Attend your hospital follow up appointment. Your wellbeing It's common to feel anxious, panicky or depressed during your recovery. It's important to talk about these feelings, either to a trusted loved one, your GP, a cardiac rehab nurse, a clinical psychologist or counsellor.

Your medication You'll need to start taking medication every day, some of which you'll continue taking for the rest of your life. Some examples of medicines you will be prescribed are: [antiplatelets](/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/medical/drug-cabinet/antiplatelets)like clopidogrel or ticagrelor are commonly prescribed for one year. Most people are also prescribed lifelong aspirin [ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) you to have only if needed. It's important to take your medication every day even if you feel well. This is to: - reduce the risk of you having another heart attack - protect your stents from blocking - prevent or treat [angina](/informationsupport/conditions/angina)attacks that can sometimes happen even if you've had treatment - help strengthen your heart - reduce the risk of further heart muscle damage - lower your [cholesterol](/informationsupport/risk-factors/high-cholesterol)level if it's high and protect your arteries from further narrowing. If you have any concerns or are worried about side effects from your medication, don't stop taking it. Instead, keep a diary of any side effects and make an appointment with your GP or speak to your pharmacist to discuss them. They may be able to recommend alternatives. Are you finding it hard to get medical help? We know that many of you are experiencing delays to treatment at this time, or have questions and concerns about getting medical help. We've created this set of information to help you with these issues. Cardiac rehabilitation [Cardiac rehabilitation](/informationsupport/support/practical-support/cardiac-rehabilitation) (cardiac rehab) is a crucial part of your treatment. It's a programme usually run by a team which includes experienced cardiac nurses, physiotherapists and exercise specialists. Its purpose is to help you recover as well, and as quickly, as possible. Each programme is different, but usually involves: - regular assessments such as pulse and blood pressure checks - advice and talks from healthcare professionals such as a dietitian and clinical psychologist - exercise sessions - group discussions - relaxation training. Sessions usually run for six to twelve weeks, once or twice a week. Anyone who's had a heart attack should be referred for cardiac rehab. You'll be invited for an assessment soon after you leave hospital and start when it's safe and appropriate for you. This is usually after about four weeks.

There are many things you can do to be healthier and reduce your risk: - don't [smoke](/informationsupport/risk-factors/smoking) [eat healthily](/informationsupport/support/healthy-living/healthy-eating) [be physically active](/informationsupport/support/healthy-living) - keep to a healthy weight and lose weight if necessary - cut down on [alcohol](/informationsupport/support/healthy-living/healthy-eating/alcohol) - control [high blood pressure](/informationsupport/risk-factors/high-blood-pressure) - control [cholesterol](/informationsupport/risk-factors/high-cholesterol)levels - control blood sugar levels (if you have [diabetes](/informationsupport/risk-factors/diabetes)). You can make lots of small choices that build up to big changes. For example, try [home cooking](/informationsupport/support/healthy-living/healthy-eating/recipe-finder) your favourite takeaway dish instead of ordering it in.
