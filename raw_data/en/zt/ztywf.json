Doesn't it then become crucial for all of us to first and foremost address, balance and even enrich our emotional state, as this is pertinent to enhancing our healing and well-being! We have had some of the toughest times of our life in these last few years and it's all-natural that all of us are carrying the baggage in the form of duress and are not in an emotional equilibrium either; Here are 8 emotional wellness activities you can start doing right away at home to boost personal emotional healing... Yoga is essentially a top-notch spiritual discipline that helps one achieve a harmonious union between mind and body, through controlled asanas (Yogic postures) and breathwork. The constituents of Yoga are many: (e.g. The Kalesvara Mudra assists in eliminating addictions, the Tse Mudra that lifts that relieves depression and grief, the Surabhi Mudra assists in relieving pain and inflammation etc.) and Super Brain Yoga (Another one of Master Choa Kok Sui's - Founder of Modern Pranic Healing unique fix known for aura balancing and also for sharpening the mind and strengthening the Aura.) Please note the patented method below: Read more about the benefits of [Yoga & Meditation.](/wellness_packages/journey-through-yoga/) As the name suggests, this is a physically therapeutic process of indulging in platonic, non-sexual and non-invasive physical intimacy to fulfil the human needs of acceptance, love, appreciation, approval and warmth. This form of therapy is found to be safe, and something that specifically supports our innate need, or cravings, for basic human touch. The physical aspect of cuddling helps heal the emotional us... you can try this with your partner, child, pet or even your favourite cuddle toy! These Salt Baths cleanse the aura off negative elementals and are best advised of being done daily... this is when you apply salt to your rinsed body and leave the salt on your body for a minute (While having your tongue touch the palate/roof of the mouth for the entire period). After a certain number of breaths, simply rinse the salt off and lo and behold, you would now have cleansed your Aura! This Pranic Healing practice makes you feel emotionally lighter, while therapeutically cleansing you... this is an amazing prerequisite of any spiritual practice. Laughter helps secretes endorphins which helps people get out of an unsettled or a depressed mood; Laughter therapy hence is a non-invasive and non-pharmacological alternative treatment for stress and depression. 4.2 SLEEP THERAPY: [Sleep Therapy](/wellness-packages/specialised-wellness) is another fabulous [mental & physical health enhancer](/blog/mental-health-the-gamechanger-for-2021/) that relaxes and repairs the self during sleep (you can self-induce a healthy sleeping pattern by reducing exposure to blue light 2-3 hours before sleep time, do breathing exercises to relax the mind, have a cleansing shower etc.). Even eating a [nutritious diet](/wellness-cuisine/) rich in Omega 3 fatty acids, Probiotics, leafy greens etc. and staying off caffeine are known to naturally stimulate the mood.

Even Music & Sound Therapy is a form of guided meditation where the music therapeutically addresses our physical, emotional, cognitive, and social needs. These forms of meditation improve respiration, lower blood pressure, improve cardiac and cognitive health while also reducing stress and muscle tension! Crystal, though a rock formation has certain unique attributes that make it an ideal healing tool... for starters, Crystal has a 'consciousness of its own'; This simply means that it has the power to bring forth or radiate healing properties to the wearer/user as per its own constituency. The pink/rose quartz crystals are known to radiate loving energy to the wearer; the clear crystal works on the physical and emotional level; The labradorite crystal lends healing cleanse & spirituality to the wearer; The Hematite crystal provides protection from negativity, and there are others one can use as need be.) This is an ancient alternative medicine technique and something that one can try as long as one is receptive to it. While wearing or using healing crystals, one can also 'charge' and 'program' the crystal to provide the owner with the benefits of its various properties; lastly, crystals should also be regularly cleaned by soaking them in salt water (for a few hours or overnight). Affirmations is the 'Secret' to Manifestation! When we affirm with a clear, calm and believing mind, we can call upon the energy of the universe to manifest anything that we want or need. These affirmations empower the energy of the emotional body and can help fix the mind, body and soul. The Magic of this Secret needs to be sincerely tried first hand, and then you will become a believer for life... but there is just one catch: You need to affirm positively so that these manifestations supplement your emotional health, instead of depleting you (by ridding you with guilt, unhappiness, etc. kind of negative elementals). This is a simple technique of positively giving thanks and feeling grateful & thankful for someone, something or anything in life; this is an ancient technique of Karma cleansing whereby being thankful and acknowledging the act or the person, in-turn brings us good Karma. The fact of the matter is that 'gratitude' whenever done with the right intention, brings forth positive energy and abundance to us, and this heals the self, both emotionally and physically! One can even create gratitude rituals (like journals, morning prayer of gratitude etc.) that can be done daily. This practice enhances our overall well-being, while also positively impacting the energy surrounding us. Know more about Atmantan's [Emotional Healing Retreat](/wellness_packages/holistic-health/).
