As such, TimelyCare providers do not supply long-term medications for chronic illness and encourage patients to see their primary care providers at least once a year. TimelyCare providers do not provide prescriptions for controlled substances, lifestyle medications, or other potentially high-risk drugs. If a prescription is clinically appropriate, it will be sent to a local pharmacy of your choice. When you are filling out your intake information, you will select a local pharmacy that is convenient for you. Care Navigators can also help you find a pharmacy that is close to you if needed. TimelyCare is not an online pharmacy and cannot fill prescriptions. If a prescription medication is part of your treatment plan, it will be sent to the pharmacy of your choice.
