Reclaim and properly support a culture which is student- and patient-centered at every juncture (remind ourselves every day of our roots; love our roots). 7. Establish and sustain a viable, profitable national, international and regional presence in higher education, continuing medical education and professional formation (spread our wings). These \"Starter Goals,\" which NCNM's Board of Directors approved in 2007, are the basis of our KPIs and strategic plan, A Framework for Action. That plan is now under way. While firmly grounded, structures also remain flexible to meet ever-changing situations. Teams and processes are in place. Our NCNM Alignment Model and Source documents hold space for our future dreams to become reality. Four years later, our plan has led to expansion and growth in all four main areas of focus: people, programs, facilities, funding. Through Continuing Medical Education courses and our newest graduate credential in botanical medicine, we are inviting health care professionals to experience natural medicine as a way of integrating effective healing processes into their practices. The campus footprint has expanded fourfold, including a new lecture hall in the NCNM Annex to open by January 2011. Adjacent to the proposed Student Center and complementing the clinic grounds is the new Min Zidell Healing Garden, which will be open before the winter solstice of 2010. Our student population continues to grow, with the likelihood of reaching an enrollment of 600 next year. By the end of the next fiscal year, our NCNM Clinic and our community clinics will have attracted more than 50,000 patient visits. Our first post-graduate certificate program in Botanical Medicine was approved within days of the end of this fiscal year, and our part-time programming in the ND, MSOM and MAc programs is in the pipeline for accreditation consideration. Even the food cart is a more permanent installation, with enhanced facilities for students, staff and patients. In many ways, what has occurred in the past year constitutes what the Chinese call Ta Kuo - \"Preponderance of the great.\" For some time, NCNM has been preparing for this crossing to a more steadfast greatness. What we are building now and into the foreseeable future is firmly based in our confidence, clarity and commitment. And the NCNM community is enthusiastically embracing the change and saying \"yes.\" We say \"yes\" within the landscape of serious upheaval in primary care in the American health care terrain. We are unapologetic and fearless in our commitment to the idea that natural medicine is the medicine of the future. Our passion and our momentum are emerging everywhere. Whether we're addressing pervasive issues such as childhood obesity and nutrition, chronic pain and disease, cancer, heart disease and stroke prevention, the energy is positive, growing and focused. The entire NCNM community (students, faculty, staff, patients, alumni and board) is moving inexorably to fill the growing and critical need for primary care physicians. We see the day when NCNM is recognized as the standard-bearer among all those providing health care to the people of this world. Beneath our many tangible and visible accomplishments, lies a deeply aligned sense of purpose, a belief in and a commitment to the medicine we teach. We at NCNM are actively creating a shift, a new future for medicine. Listen carefully: You can hear the resounding \"YES\" from all corners of our community! Nancy Wastcoat Garbett, MEd David J. Schleich, PhD Chair, Board of Directors President The more we grow, the more we grow. Progress begets progress. Giving attracts giving. And so 2010 was a year of tipping points\u2014the year we moved beyond survival to resilience and growth. 2010 was a year when more and more members of the NCNM community embraced the vision of a college with the obligation, the motivation and the resources to advance the medicine we love and serve; the vision of a college that propels that medicine into a world yearning for it, as a river yearns for the sea. After years of flux and uncertainty, NCNM has moved boldly toward understanding and refining our strengths and potential, and defining an abundant, important and compelling future. In 2007, we developed seven \"Starter Goals\": 1. Sustain, maintain and enhance existing and new institutional and programmatic accreditation (stay in the game). 2. Grow our recurrent, annualized revenue stream to $20 million by the end of fiscal 2013 (play the game well and accumulate energy). 3. Grow our annualized donation and sponsorship revenue to $1 million by the end of fiscal 2013 (leverage the stakes, gather friends). 4. Establish a multi-purpose campus for 800 full-time and 200 part-time students, and 40,000 patient visits by the end of fiscal 2013 (set the target, optimize capacity, drive professional formation). 5. Brand NCNM as NUHM, a multi-program university of natural medicine and research with our naturopathic and classical Chinese medicine roots as our sustaining, prevailing core by the end of fiscal 2014 (achieve an identity as a higher education center, equal player). 2009-2010: The Tipping Point\u2014The Year of \"YES\" We say \"yes\" within the landscape of serious upheaval in primary care in the American health care terrain. We are unapologetic and fearless in our commitment to the idea that natural medicine is the medicine of the future.4 NCNM 2009-2010 Annual Report NCNM 2009-2010 Annual Report 5 and alternative medicine. In fact, the very term \"CAM\" is transforming to the word \"integrated,\" suggesting a coming together of allopathic and natural medicine systems. Hospitals and clinics have been opening integrative medicine centers with little fanfare or media attention, and preventive health care is being met with greater understanding and acceptance. While we welcome this much-anticipated convergence, it is our primary mission to maintain the integrity of naturopathic and classical Chinese medicine philosophical foundations so that these systems remain intact, whether they function as standalone systems or are included within \"integrated medicine.\" As more people turn to healthy living and natural medicine, a growing body of evidence also points to a parallel challenge. There is a critical shortage of primary care physicians. Here in Oregon, lawmakers addressed that crisis in 2009 by expanding the prescribing authority of naturopathic doctors, signifying a deepening awareness about the education and training that NDs receive and the role they can perform as primary care physicians. A horizon where natural medicine professionals are widely embraced as primary care colleagues, once a distant horizon, is a reachable shore for NCNM alumni. Our Campus A short year ago NCNM proudly began showcasing the long-awaited NCNM Clinic, expanding the college footprint in South Portland and defining the southern boundary of our emerging campus. R&H Construction teams put the finishing touches on the 18,000 square-foot facility, and the doors to the NCNM Natural Health Center on First Avenue and Pettygrove Clinic closed for the last time. Staff, faculty and students moved boxes and equipment from the two separate clinical operations of naturopathic medicine and classical Chinese medicine into the new facility, integrating all clinical services on campus. By August, the clinic was open for business and in late September, dignitaries\u2014led by Mayor Sam Adams, State Senator Laurie Monnes-Anderson, State Senator Ginny Burdick and House Representative Mary Nolan\u2014gathered with the college's extended community in the NCNM Clinic courtyard to celebrate its Grand Opening. The day represented a leap forward. A new era had begun for NCNM. NCNM's founders saw natural medicine at a crossroad. The profession's philosophical roots and therapeutic modalities had become increasingly marginalized as the allopathic model became more prominent in 20th century Western medicine. Naturopathic doctors and practitioners realized that they literally held the profession's future in their hands; if they failed to preserve their legacy, it would disappear. And so they created a safe haven for natural medicine, patiently working and waiting until the tides of public opinion changed once more. Generations of NCNM graduates inherited our founders' deep belief in the healing power of nature, along with their stubborn tenacity\u2014traits that have helped the practice of natural medicine thrive. The turbulent waters of change, not only in economic regulation and stabilizing liquidity and investment, but also in terms of a rapidly transforming health care arena, continued to unsettle our nation this year, touching each of our lives. In the midst of much political turmoil, a more quiet health care revolution is taking place throughout the nation. A recent National Institutes of Health study reported that nearly 40 percent of Americans now turn to so-called complementary Introduction Generations of NCNM graduates inherited our founders' deep belief in the healing power of nature, along with their stubborn tenacity\u2014 traits that have helped the practice of natural medicine thrive.New Vistas, New Horizons 6 NCNM 2009-2010 Annual Report NCNM 2009-2010 Annual Report 7 As the fiscal year came to a close, NCNM's six-month negotiation to purchase an additional facility for the campus was nearing completion. The 5,000 square-foot building occupies the northern boundary of NCNM's four city-block campus footprint, close to the Administration building and to the main Academic building. Soon, students will be walking the short distance between buildings. The new acquisition is an ideal multi-use structure for the campus with the potential to accommodate a large lecture hall, classrooms and conference rooms. Even as the college invested in its future through campus expansion, current facilities were continuously being upgraded and improved. At the close of this academic year, scheduled improvements were ramping up to refurbish classrooms and the student lounge. Work was also under way to prepare the construction of a new and improved Divine Caf\u00e9, the college's food services operation. As ever, students contributed enthusiastically to enhancements on campus. They received permission from NCNM administrators to create and install a 35-foot mural, \"The Roots of Natural Medicine,\" painted by local artist, Kolieha Bush. The colorful artwork, representing the origins of natural medicine, was permanently installed in the Academic building in April. Commissioned by NCNM's SGA and AWARE students groups, the new artwork pays tribute to indigenous women and men, natural medicine's forebears. The NMSA installed two maps in the same corridor, complete with current data about licensing and regulatory conditions in American states for naturopathic and classical Chinese medicine. In a year all about building capacity for a rapidly unfolding future, NCNM is laying a solid foundation for its future while maintaining its strong links to the traditions of the past\u2014traditions that have secured its reputation as the nation's founder and leader in natural medicine education, research and patient care. Unveiling \"The Roots of Natural Medicine\" Each change opened space for even more development. Adjacent to the new clinic, an old building was demolished and the complicated process of transforming a patch of unoccupied ground into the Min Zidell Healing Garden began. The garden, a generous gift to NCNM from the Zidell family in honor of their mother, helps NCNM realize the next in a medley of long- cherished dreams: A botanical teaching garden for its students and an oasis in the heart of its campus. The college began the search for a landscape design partner that could meet the design parameters and requirements for the new garden, while fulfilling the vision of a botanical garden integrating the needs of both naturopathic and Chinese medicine into one cohesive and beautiful landscape. A Request for Proposal process allowed college administrators and the Zidell family to consider a handful of Oregon's top landscape firms. By June 2010 that process was nearly completed, preparing the way for the exciting next steps of design collaboration and groundbreaking. In March NCNM welcomed the donation of a life-size bronze sculpture of Sun Simiao, the greatly revered Chinese physician. The statue was a gift from the prominent Chinese sculptor, Huo Bao Zhu, a friend of the CCM program, and the City of Portland.Such developments, however, require a framework for action. In May 2010 NCNM began its Master Planning process, which will provide a vision and rationale for campus growth and development to accommodate increased enrollment in the future. By permanently locating the campus in South Portland, the college is now busy creating a sustainable plan that meets City of Portland and regional zoning requirements, and allows city and transportation agencies to incorporate NCNM's long-term goals into their respective plans and priorities. NCNM is located within the North Macadam Urban Renewal area, one of the City's key areas of development. Transportation planning is currently under way by the City and State of Oregon that will significantly affect the area. NCNM brought on board some of Portland's most respected urban and land use planners to help fast-track a three- phase Master Planning process, with an anticipated 2013 completion date. By the end of the 2009-2010 fiscal year, NCNM was well within sight of submitting a Conditional Use Master Plan to the City of Portland. Once approved, NCNM's remodeling and expansion projects will be streamlined, greatly reducing anticipated timeframes for completion dates. Sun Simiao sculptureNCNM Master Planning Committee meets with the Portland Development Commission and NCNM neighbors8 NCNM 2009-2010 Annual Report NCNM 2009-2010 Annual Report 9 Research As more Americans turn toward natural medicine, there is a growing need for clinical studies that demonstrate its safety and effectiveness. To address that need, NCNM's Helfgott Research Institute\u2014under the direction of Dean Heather Zwickey, PhD\u2014 is training NCNM students in the key research areas and methodologies. All over America research funding opportunities declined this year, as institutions like the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) refocused priorities and coped with reduced budgets. With one eye on these market conditions and one eye on the future, Helfgott operations were restructured this year. To assure sustainability, a core group of investigators and staff re-examined how to bring research into NCNM's core curriculum. The primary catalyst for this change was a project first funded by NCCAM in 2007, the R25 Research Education grant. The R25 project supports Helfgott in training NCNM's naturopathic and Chinese medicine faculty in evidence-informed practice (EIP), expanding curriculum development from the classroom to clinical education, and advanced research training. Always energetically creative, Helfgott developed Mini-Med, an innovative weekend immersion program that provides a faculty training ground in teaching research concepts while introducing natural medicine to high school and college students. The hands- on Mini-Med experience drew young pre-med scholars from across the nation to learn about natural medicine from NCNM's expert faculty. The depth and breadth of Helfgott's researchers are exemplified by Agatha Colbert, MD. This Helfgott senior investigator completed an apprenticeship in acupuncture and practiced for several years before joining the NCNM faculty. Dr. Colbert initiated a research program to define the electrical characteristics of acupuncture points by measuring the electrical properties of the skin. Her research on therapeutic magnets and carpal tunnel syndrome has appeared this year in numerous peer-review publications. Helfgott Post-Doctoral Fellow, Kim Tippens, ND, LAc, and Research Project Coordinator, Erin Connelly, MA, collaborated with Portland's Working Class Acupuncture to study the community acupuncture model of health care delivery. Community acupuncture clinics\u2014a recent innovation in acupuncture service delivery that provides a low-cost, The 2009-2010 year unfolded a wide front of important, strategic changes not only on the college campus but also within its educational programs. NCNM's Interim Provost, Andrea Smith, EdD, and her team of academic leaders tirelessly gave attention to academic facilities development, refining of resources, program development, curriculum design and enrichment, faculty development, and student services enhancements\u2014always with a clear goal of sustaining and strengthening NCNM's reputation as the natural medicine educator of choice. Excellence in classroom and clinical education, research skill development and patient care comprise the foundation upon which NCNM's reputation rests. Even as the college opened the doors of its new teaching clinic, plans were under way by NCNM's Program Development Team and the Provost's Planning Council to develop new and innovative curricula to complement current academic programs. The most recent example of this is the newly approved Post-Graduate Certificate in Botanical Medicine, to be launched in fall 2011. Created to broaden NCNM's reach among professionals in both mainstream and natural medicine, the new certificate curriculum will integrate traditional herbal wisdom with the most up-to-date medical and scientific information.Our Teaching Centers of Excellence Building for the Future Excellence in classroom and clinical education, research skill development and patient care comprise the foundation upon which NCNM's reputation rests.10 NCNM 2009-2010 Annual Report NCNM 2009-2010 Annual Report 11 NCNM also was the proud host of the 6th Annual Naturopathic Gathering in 2009, the profession's annual assembly of physicians and students bringing naturopathic elders together with new generations of practitioners to discuss vitalistic medicine in practice and theory. The event drew a capacity crowd to NCNM's Great Hall. NCNM honored Dr. Gerald Farnsworth, an NCNM founder, with its 2009 Beacon Award at the event. School of Classical Chinese Medicine The goal of the School of Classical Chinese Medicine is the cultivation of clinical practitioners rooted in the ancient traditions of the medical scholar. NCNM's CCM program, one of the few offered in the world, is contributing strongly to a resurgence of interest in the ancient classical texts. In keeping with its focus on transmitting intact the art, science and spirit of classical Chinese medicine to future practitioners, the CCM department, led by Dean Laurie Regan, PhD, ND, has focused this year on incorporating China's ancient texts into the core curriculum, helping students to become scholars while promoting the classical mission of the CCM program. This commitment is more than transmission of ancient practices; it further defines the unique philosophy and practice of classical Chinese medicine as a comprehensive body of knowledge rather than merely a collection of modalities that can be assimilated by other medical professionals. At the same time, CCM administrators and faculty are dedicated to incorporating concepts of evidence-based medicine into the curriculum. One of the first to do this is a new member of the CCM faculty, Associate Professor Roger Batchelor, DAOM, LAc, with his first-year course titled \"Bridging Heaven and Earth: Ways of Knowing\" for first-year students. Dean Regan is developing out - come statements that include evidence-based medicine for future competency expectations of NCNM graduates. The department continued to foster collaborations with other institutions of higher learning. Visiting educators from Brown University and Goddard College came to NCNM this year to discuss potential joint educational ventures. The department has a Memorandum of Understanding with Guangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Nanning, China, and continues its close relationship with that educational institution. The CCM Visiting Scholar program brought a number of renowned experts to campus, including two esteemed Chinese master teachers, Dr. Zeng Rongxiu and Dr. Wu Kanheng; and Manfred Kubny, PhD, one of the world's foremost authorities on Bazi Suanming. Professor Rihui Long talks with CCM students and facultyAssociate Professor Roger Batchelorcommunity-based treatment\u2014may improve access to acupuncture and offer a viable low-cost strategy for chronic disease management. Helfgott is one of NCNM's most important outreach ambassadors to the biomedicine community. The Helfgott team continued its innovative partnership again this year with Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU). Not only did the 5th Annual Symposium for Portland Area Research on Complementary and Alternative Medicine (SPARC) conference occur, with Helfgott as a key catalyst, but the team worked closely with Oregon Collaborative for Integrative Medicine to bring Dr. Avidad Haramati from Georgetown University to speak at a SPARC pre-conference event.Typical of Helfgott's higher education community partnership focus was the creation of The Pacific Northwest Anti-Inflammatory Reference Cookbook. Helfgott Senior Investigator, Pat Elmer, PhD, worked with OHSU's Clinical & Translational Research Institute (OCTRI) Bionutrition Unit for an NIH-sponsored study on the health effects of this diet on persons with impaired glucose tolerance, which led OCTRI staff to publish the nutritional cookbook. Helfgott also hosted a meeting to introduce the first multi-school practice-based research network, developed this year by Senior Investigator, Carlo Calabrese, ND. The observational research will allow investigators to collect whole-system data on naturopathic practice. School of Naturopathic Medicine The naturopathic medical community is constantly striving to improve ND curricula, and important milestones have been accomplished in recent years. An important undertaking nearing completion through the leadership of Dean Rita Bettenburg, ND, and in partnership with the deans from our sister schools within the Association of Accredited Naturopathic Medical Colleges, is the development of both knowledge- and practice-based competency requirements for ND program graduates. This project has been years in the making and will result in NCNM having program outcome statements that clearly define competency expectations of its graduates before they enter practice. Competencies will include methods of evaluating outcomes in all academic and clinical areas of the ND program. This ambitious project is expected to assist NCNM in meeting future accreditation standards set by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME). NCNM received the CNME's vote of confidence this year with an accreditation affirmation for a period of five years, the longest reaffirmation period the agency provides. The School of Naturopathic Medicine welcomed new Associate Dean of Naturopathic Medicine, Margot Longenecker, ND. In addition to her other duties, Dr. Longenecker is responsible for clinical education, and will work closely with the dean of clinical operations. A 1998 graduate of NCNM, Dr. Longenecker taught at the University of Bridgeport's College of Naturopathic Medicine after completing her two-year residency. She also co-directed the Integrative Medicine Center at Griffin Hospital in Derby. A former board member of the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians, Dr. Longenecker practiced medicine in New Haven prior to joining NCNM. Another significant addition to NCNM's naturopathic medical administration is Residency Program Director, Melanie Henriksen, ND, LAc, who will develop and expand NCNM's residency program opportunities. Among these was the addition of an oncology residency, the result of a collaboration with the Oncology Association of Naturopathic Physicians. NCNM students Erin Sharman and Nicci Lambert 12 NCNM 2009-2010 Annual Report NCNM 2009-2010 Annual Report 13 Dr. Jennifer Tufenkian assisting patients at the NCNM ClinicNCNM developed a year-long series of monthly public presentations at Portland's celebrated Lan Su Chinese Garden to kick-off the Chinese New Year in February. The series, \"Ancient Chinese Cosmology: The Grand Cycle of Nature,\" shows how traditional Chinese symbolism is associated with the months of the year, and with human physiology and health. The popular series was launched by CCM Founding Professor, Dr. Heiner Fruehauf. Student enrollment is steadily increasing as the reputation of the School of CCM grows nationally and internationally. At the same time, the department proactively has been examining ways of expanding its program offerings to meet the needs of a changing student population. It is also growing its faculty with the addition this year of Brenda Hood, PhD, a classical Chinese studies scholar who recently returned to North America after 20 years of study in China. The department was also pleased to add Robert Quinn, MAcOM, DAOM, to its full-time faculty. Both Drs. Hood and Quinn will begin their full-time positions in the 2010-2011 academic year. Patient Care Following a year of concentrated planning to create a teaching clinic on campus, the grand opening of the new NCNM Clinic received abundant media coverage, raising public awareness about the clinic and the college. Students and faculty attributed much of the success of the problem-free integration of the naturopathic and Chinese medicine programs into a single, high-quality clinical operation to the Dean of Clinical Operations, Jill Sanders Stanard, ND. Clinical staff and faculty focused even more attention on patient satisfaction, recruitment and retention this year. While it was expected to take time to build the number of patient visits back to levels experienced prior to the move, numbers were already rising by year-end as more people learned about the new clinic through advertising, media coverage, tours and regularly scheduled Open Houses, featuring presentations and free introductory patient mini-visits. The Clinical Operations department models a culture of continuous improvement\u2014within the NCNM Clinic, and in the school's 14 community clinics, which are spread throughout the Portland metropolitan area. The new teaching clinic provided a valuable opportunity to examine efficiencies in all areas. For example, improvements were realized in medicinary inventory control and distribution as NCNM's Retail Operations worked with the clinic to implement a point-of-service inventory system. The clinic also introduced a number of new service offerings this year. Prominent among them was a new aesthetic medicine program, which opened in April after the clinic received a gener - ous donation of Mistral phototherapy skincare equipment. Other new services include shiatsu massages, colonic hydrotherapy and massage therapy. New staff\u2014including a community clinic manager and a patient services coordinator\u2014were added to strengthen NCNM's expand- ing community clinic operation. These staff members, charged with increasing the level and quality of service to a growing number of patients requiring low-cost health care, refined numerous polices and procedures to better meet the needs of patients, students and faculty. NCNM's community clinics were awarded two grants this year: A Clear.com grant for 15 months of free wireless Internet service in all of NCNM's community clinics to expedite and improve patient communications; and a United Way grant, shared with its Coalition of Community partners, to assess present and future information technology needs. NCNM Clinic lobby14 NCNM 2009-2010 Annual Report NCNM 2009-2010 Annual Report 15 Advancement Despite a continued depressed economic environment, the Advancement department kept building steadily its critical high profile with NCNM alumni, Program Partners, the new Board of Regents and other friends. The college's Right Place, Right Time capital campaign, in the last months of its silent phase, is build- ing momentum. One element of the overall capital campaign, described in detail in NCNM's Case Statement, is the Green Brick Road project. As friends of the college buy bricks, those donations gradually assemble into a path of pavers and benches and other installations engraved with the names of donors throughout the campus. The Right Place, Right Time capital campaign tells the story of NCNM's dreams not only for a beautiful, expanded and integrated campus, but also for resources to enrich and strength- en our teaching and learning mission, classroom by classroom, clinic treatment room by clinic treatment room. The vision of a healing garden, rooftop gardens, a day care center, continuously improving equipment, new classrooms and more, are all part of the campaign. The opening of the NCNM Clinic brought community and stakeholder attention to what we can do, and joyfully reminded us that there are many individuals, groups, companies and agencies who believe in us and will help us get there. For example, before the year was over, the college took its first steps toward the creation of the donor-funded Min Zidell Healing Garden, slated for construction in 2010-2011. In the last few years, NCNM has described a future that makes NCNM accessible, efficient and progressive. The recent additions to the campus footprint demonstrate that the college's goal\u2014 to raise $25 million by 2015\u2014is realistic and attainable through continued donor cultivation and partner relationships. Future plans include a beautifully landscaped campus with a lecture auditorium, research facility, student services center, and a cafeteria\u2014not to mention a new library, medical spa and Chinese tea house. As the fiscal year ended, negotiations for the lecture hall were nearly complete. In addition, the former First Avenue clinic building will soon house a proposed new graduate degree program, continuing education programming, and improved facilities to accommodate an essential academic division of the college, NCNM's Helfgott Research Institute. NCNM's administrative teams are the engine that propels the college forward. From major multi-departmental initiatives to individual staff efforts, the often unheralded work of our admin- istrative staff is a significant factor in NCNM's success. Here are some highlights from the past year. Admissions NCNM's Admissions team never stops refining its student recruit - ment strategies and activities. The school maintained its steady, managed growth in enrollment this year, reaching 517 students. The newest winter cohort, now in its second year, nearly doubled enrollment over last year, with 31 new students. The Admissions outreach campaign, supported by NCNM alumni, faculty, staff and students, continued to play an energetic role in attracting more ND students than any other school in North America. In March, the Admissions department relocated to new and improved office space, offering ADA-accessibility for visitors and students, and providing private offices for the Admissions counselors.The Changing Face of NCNM Our Administration The Right Place, Right Time capital campaign tells the story of NCNM's dreams not only for a beautiful, expanded and integrated campus, but also for resources to enrich and strengthen our teaching and learning mission, classroom by classroom, clinic treatment room by clinic treatment room. 16 NCNM 2009-2010 Annual Report NCNM 2009-2010 Annual Report 17 In fulfilling the department's support role, it produced high- quality brochures, banners and table-top cards, invitations, print ads, T-shirt designs and much more. Marketing & Communications was also responsible for planning, promoting and coordinating the day-long, highly visible and very successful NCNM Clinic Grand Opening event\u2014working side-by-side with other college departments. NCNM faculty, staff and senior students gladly accepted speaking opportunities arranged by the department throughout the year. NCNM was well represented at a variety of events, including the Archimedes Movement Conference, Body Mind Spirit Expo, AsiaFest, Port of Portland, the Portland Marathon, Muddy Boots Festival, the University Club and the Susan G. Komen Foundation Conference, to name just a few. NCNM was also the main sponsor of the South Portland Neighborhood Association's summer concerts program series. The department continues to market to or communicate with all of its audiences, from new patients and city officials to its neigh- bors in South Portland, making new friends and supporters as it tells the world at large about NCNM\u2014and about natural medicine. Student Services Student Services, the lifeline for NCNM students, provides a wide range of resources needed to assist students in successfully completing their education. This year the department also focused on student life after graduation through professional formation. The department launched a small but growing business center that includes information on starting a business, securing business loans, and provided training courses for students on business management, health care billing manage - ment and patient record-charting practices. In addition to working with the new ND residency director to develop more residency opportunities for graduates, preparations for NCNM's first Natural & Integrative Medicine Career Fair for natural medicine students, graduates and alumni, are under way. The career fair is scheduled to take place in August 2010.The department also has expanded its efforts to help achieve diversity within the NCNM community by introducing training for program deans and faculty, and by building a stronger infrastructure that is inclusive and supportive of diversity. The new director of counseling services, hired in May 2010, will play a significant role in these developments and in programs for students. In addition to holding NCNM's first December graduating cohort ceremony, the department hosted the 2010 Commencement at the Portland Art Museum's Mark Building in June. More than 100 students graduated in a ceremony characterized by pageantry and pride of achievement. NCNM also honored two naturopathic leaders of distinction. Dr. Les Griffith, a 1975 graduate, who co-founded Bastyr University, received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree; Dr. Shirley Snow\u2014legendary for her advocacy of naturopathic licensure in Florida and instrumental in achieving approval for ND licensure in New Hampshire\u2014was awarded an NCNM Presidential Medallion for her lifetime of work.NCNM alumnus, Dr. Les Griffith, accepts an honorary NCNM degree at the 2010 CommencementThis year has been significant to NCNM in powerful partner collaborations. We formed alliances with important new supporters. Generous contributions by Welch Allyn and Radiancy for state-of-the art medical equipment have greatly enhanced the NCNM Clinic's ability to serve a new and diverse population of patients. Our partners are helping our students develop and build many new, entrepreneurial and professional skills. For example, the new Bob's Red Mill Intercollegiate Cup student scholarship contest was launched at the Northwest Naturopathic Physicians Conference. The 3rd Annual ZRT Cup, sponsored by ZRT Laboratory, attracted contestants from every naturopathic program in North America. The popular college bowl competition takes place during the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians Conference and showcases the extraordinary skills and knowledge of our upcoming graduates. In addition to building new alliances, Advancement pays tribute throughout the year to the NCNM community\u2014faculty, staff, alumni and Board of Regents\u2014for their work and accomplish- ments. The alumni events that Advancement hosts have been increasingly successful. This year, more than 350 people attended the annual Sweetheart Ball and more than 100 vendors and 300 attendees participated in NCNM's Health Biz Expo events. NCNM's Continuing Education program, administered through the Advancement department, continued developing new alumni offerings in pursuit of NCNM's mandate to be the \"Trainer of Choice\" for natural medicine. NCNM's CE program collaborates with state associations, NCNM Partners and NCNM's academic departments to produce high-quality CE courses in the classroom and online. As the program expands its offerings, it has seen concomitant growth in class participation and revenue. Marketing & Communications It's no accident that NCNM is now included in the Portland Business Journal's Book of Lists as one of the top schools in Oregon. NCNM made its mark again this year in many ways\u2014 advertising, media coverage, a revamped website and a growing number of major NCNM publications and other collateral. In addition to the annual production of the course catalog, viewbook, annual report and other publications, NCNM's new quarterly newsletter, Nexus, was launched this year. Marketing & Communications also increased NCNM's presence in the growing social media world, with regular postings on Facebook and Twitter.

Society for Acupuncture Research, Chapel Hill, NC, March 19-21, 2010 Our People Accomplishments Our rigorous natural medicine curricula and excellence in research attract the best and brightest, making it no surprise that NCNM consistently appears in peer-review journals and other notable publications. Our faculty is comprised of talented physicians, practitioners and scientists with a considerable breadth of experience\u2014recognized experts in their fields. Our students, who are educated by some of the finest natural medicine practitioners in the world, also are honored for their achievements. Although too numerous to mention in full, the instances noted below illustrate the broad range of academic and professional recognition achieved in the 2009-2010 year. Student, Faculty and Staff Honors & Highlights NCNM student researchers Jeremy Mikolai, Andrew Erlandsen and Andrew Murison presented their internationally acclaimed study of ashwagandha at the esteemed Scripps Conference on Natural Products Research and won first place honors in the category of basic science, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews. They also received media attention from the Portland Business Journal, as well as national publications. Dean of the School of Naturopathic Medicine, Dr. Rita Bettenburg, was appointed president of the prestigious Council on Naturopathic Medicine Education (CNME). The CNME is the programmatic accrediting agency of naturopathic medical education for four-year naturopathic colleges and programs in the U.S. and Canada. Student Derek Andre won the first annual Bob's Red Mill Intercollegiate Cup student scholarship contest held at the Northwest Naturopathic Physicians Conference. Derek was awarded a $5,000 scholarship and the first-place trophy for his YouTube video about the glories of oats and his 10-minute conference presentation, \"Food as Medicine.\" Selected Publications Thong T, Colbert AP and Larsen AP .

It is expected that the introduction of part-time programs will generate new income by attracting previously untapped demographic groups. We anticipate that it will also create more accurate revenue projections as current students formally choose this alternative. The uncertain U.S. economic environment continued to influence NCNM budgeting and fundraising strategies this year. As a result, contingency reserves were increased for 2009-2010 in two key revenue areas. An enrollment contingency of more than $400,000 was created; however, with registration numbers greater than expected, this fund was largely unused. The college also set a clinic revenue contingency of $500,000 as a safeguard against a possible decline of patient-generated income due to the consolidation of the two former teaching clinics into the new NCNM Clinic. This contingency was not required since patient counts were higher than anticipated. To summarize, 2009-2010 was a highly successful year for NCNM. The college's balance sheet was strengthened by a significant increase in assets followed by a drop in liability/debt. As a result, the U.S. Department of Education composite ratio\u2014the federal government's critical measure of an institution's financial health\u2014rose from 1.6 in June 2009 to 2.0 in June of 2010\u2014a 25% increase.

Unrestricted assets increased during the same time period: As of June 30, 2009, the college reported $3,618,584 in unrestricted net assets; by June 30, 2010, that figure was $5,311,075\u2014an increase of $1,692,491 (21%). In 2009-2010, NCNM's total assets increased by $630,640 to a total of $19,554,390. Overall enrollment, as measured in winter quarter, rose during the last five years. Adding the winter admit option in January 2009 augmented the upward trend by adding students who could not matriculate the previous fall due to incomplete prerequisites or for personal reasons. In January 2010, the college admitted 32 new students compared with 24 new students the previous year. These figures, when added to incremental increases in fall quarters, signify an enrollment trend we anticipate will continue in coming years. Following the renewal of the Higher Education Act in 2009, the federal government mandated that all schools switch to Federal Direct Lending versus the Federal Family Loan program. NCNM successfully completed this conversion in spring 2010, ensuring a smooth transition for our students in the important financial aid arena. One trend which will require careful monitoring in the future is the increasing number of students choosing part-time schedules each term. Current revenue projections are based on the number of full-time students, figures that become less accurate as this percentage declines.
