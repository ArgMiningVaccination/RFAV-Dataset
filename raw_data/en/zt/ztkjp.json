Prolly gonna not shock some people but Ashwagandha has been hailed as this miracle herb cures stress, non addictive you know the deal most of us here who purchased it had or still has these views. While i understand that Ash works for some people the long term effects are the opposite of the claimed effects. While i cant deny ash's effect on Anxiety its not worth the side effects for me. Firstly speaking ashwagandha isn't just an adaptogen its a GABAergic substance while not as potent or intoxicating like alcohol or benzos theres a distinct Gaba feel I can feel its not as powerful as xanax for me but there a resemblance to a Gaba like feel muscle relaxation, a general sense of clam IDGF feeling although the i dont give a shit feeling is not that strong so im less likely to get into fights unlike Xanax. \"Ashwagandha treatment significantly increased GABA levels in the corticohippocampal lysates over both control and ethanol-treated animals. Ashwagandha has been previously reported to have GABA-mimetic activity by acting on both GABAA and GABAB receptors and may also have glycine mimetic action.\" This effect can be certainly felt with a dose of 3-5 grams of Ash which is recommended for anxiety disorders. This could potentially mean withdrawal however this is dose dependant but low doses of Ash anything under a gram basically does nothing for me. Secondly since the popularity of Ashwagandha has blown up over the past years lots of people having been consuming this drug( yes i said drug). This has lead to the documentation of a side effect that is now seen as a common effect of Ash which is moderate to severe irritability and anger. While this effect appears at different stages for different people at different intensities if you use Ashwagandha regularly at therapeutic doses( doses that you can actually feel) your likely to run into this effect which is the result of an overactive thyroid gland while short term use might not be that concerning long term effects of overstimulating the thyroid might not be to good for you. In summary while it has its uses personally for me it can be only used temporarily for certain events like interviews or group presentations while it has its uses its definitely not as harmless as i orginal was lead to believe. EDIT: i have 20:1 root extract 1 pill= 1000mg of normal ash root POWDER EDIT again please take the time to understand what this means as people seem to think it means something like 3 grams "}
