Echinacea stimulates the overall activity of the cells responsible for fighting infection and makes our own immune cells more efficient at attacking bacteria and viruses. It is known to shorten the duration of colds and flus. Echinacea root makes a [powerful tincture](https://www.growforagecookferment.com/how-to-make-a-tincture-elderberry-echinacea/), but is also good in a tea. It does have a bit of a bitter taste, but works well when combined with other, better tasting herbs.

Ginger I drink ginger in my tea every morning! I love the spicy bite that it gives, and I believe it is part of why I rarely get sick. Ginger can be made into a healing [medicinal syrup](https://theherbalacademy.com/ginger-syrup/), or fermented as a [ginger bug](https://www.growforagecookferment.com/how-to-make-a-ginger-bug/) to make tasty ginger ale or [ginger beer](https://www.growforagecookferment.com/fermented-apple-ginger-beer/). Ginger is antiviral, antimicrobial, and an immune stimulator. It activates T-cells which are important for the immune system, and is also decongesting and good for sore throats. Immune Boosting Herbal Tea Blend Recipe Making this herbal tea blend is easy. I generally do approximately equal parts of each dried herb, and I keep some in a little jar so that I always have some on hand. If you'd like to use fresh ginger instead of dried, you can always leave that out of the blend until you are ready to make the tea, then add the fresh root. To make the tea, bring 1-2 tablespoons of the tea blend mixture per cup of water to a boil, then simmer for 15-30 minutes or more. The longer you simmer, the stronger the tea will be! Drink 1-3 times per day when you feel the very beginnings of a sickness coming on, or even if you feel like you may be in an immune compromised situation, such a a long plane ride. Continue taking for up to 2 weeks if needed. The best part about this immune boosting herbal tea blend is that it actually tastes good! The combination of the elderberries, rose hips, and ginger give it a nice berry flavor with a sweet and spicy kick from the ginger. It's a treat to drink when the winter sickies come on!
