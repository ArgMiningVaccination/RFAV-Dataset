PEDIARIX should not be used for the birth dose of hepatitis B. The North Dakota Departm ent of He alth (NDDoH) h as discovered that som e providers have been inadvertently vaccinating child ren with invalid do ses of vaccine. All vaccines have a four-day grace period for minim um ages and intervals. However, the grace p eriod should n ot be used to schedule immunizations. It should be used only in extrem e circum stances. Invalid doses occur when immunizations are not adm inistered in acco rdance with the Advisory Comm ittee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidelines. The most commonly identif ied iss ue resulting in invalid vaccinations is vaccines administered at inappropriate ages. If an invalid vaccine do se is adm inistered, the doses m ust be entered into the North Dakota Immunization Infor mation System (NDIIS) as \"invalid.\" The parent/guardian of the child must then be notif ied and the child should be appropriately revaccinated. The follow ing guidelin es are provided to assist providers to ensu re that vaccines are adminis tered appro priately. A schedule showing the m inimum ages and intervals for each vaccin e can be found in appendix A of the Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventab le Diseases Manual (\"pink book\"). ickenpox) vaccine sho uld not be adm inistered if the child is younger than one year of age.

Influenz a Update For current infor mation about influenza activ ity in North Dakota, visit the No rth Dakota Departm ent of Health's influenza website at www.ndflu.com . The Centers for Disease Con trol and Prevention (CDC) influenza w ebsite has up-to-date inform ation about influenza activity throughout the United States, as well as inform ation about influenza vaccine, vaccine shortages, testing, anti-viral m edication and prevention. The CDC inf luenza website is ava ilable at www.cdc.go v accin e (PPV-23) should be routinely adm inistered to all adults age 65 and older. The vaccine also should be used for people age 2 and older who h ave chron ic illn esses o r are immunocomprom ised. One dose of PPV-23 should be adm inistered to adults older than 65 and to pe ople who have a chron ic illness or immunocomprom ised. Routine revaccina tion of immu nocompeta nt PPV-23 is not reco mmended . High-risk individu als who received one vaccin e dose before age 65 should receive one m ore dose after age 65. The second dose should be given at least five years after the first dose. Prevention Partnership m embers should enter adult p neumococcal imm unizations into NDIIS, as well as all vaccinatio ns. Although people 65 and older need only one dose of PPV-23, m any have received m ore than one dos e because th ey did not re call receiving PP V-23. Entering PPV-23 and all other immuniz ations into the registry pr events the administration of extra doses of vaccine. Elim inating unnecessary extra doses of vaccine not on ly saves m oney, but also prev ents vaccin Immuniza tions ente red into NDIIS also are easily identified if a vaccine lot need s to be reca lled. Continuous Temperature Monitor Wheels The North Dakota Imm unization Pro gram has recei ved num erous calls from providers indicating that the continuous tem perature m onitor wheels sent to Prevention Partnership Providers in March are not working properly. If you have a problem with the m onitor, please call the company at 800.323.2448. If your monitor is not wo rking properly, contin ue to send in your manual te mperature logs m onthly.

If a child com es into the clinic two days early for an imm unization, and he or she is younger than the m inimum age for the vaccin e, can I imm unize th e child ? A. Yes. There is a four-day grace period for adm inistering vaccin es. However, immunizations m ay be given no earlier than four days before the m inimum age. 2. What is the difference b etween the Evans and Aventis Pasteur brands of influenza vaccine? A. Evans brand influenza v accine (Fluv irin ) is ap proved for use am ong people age 4 and older. Aventis Pasteur brand influenza vacc ine (Fluzone) is approved for use in people age 6 m onths and older. Influenz a Vaccine Dosage Age Group Dose Route 6-35 m onths * .25 m L IM 3-8 years* .50 m L IM 9 years and older .50 m L IM * If a child is younger than age 9 and has never received a flu shot, tw o doses of influenz a vaccine sho uld be admini stered a t least four w eeks apart, if vaccine is available. Influenz a vaccine sh ould not be held for use as a second dose. 3. What should be done if a .50 m L dose of infl uenza vaccin e is acciden tally given to a child younger than age 3? A. A .25 m L dose should be given on schedule in four weeks if it is the child's first influenza vaccination. A \"double\" dose shoul d not be considered two doses. This is a m edication adm inistration error. 4. What should be done if an injection is gi ven via the wrong route (IM instead of SC)? A. Vaccines sh ould always be given by the route recomm ended by the m anufacturer. However, the Advisory Comm ittee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recomm ends that vaccines given by the wr ong route be counted as valid with two exceptions: hepatitis B or rabies vaccine given by any route other than IM should be considered invalid and should be repeated. 5. Would a dose of 1 m L of 10 m cg Engerix-B\u00ae (two vials of the pediatric dose) be the same as 1 mL of 20 m cg (one vial of the adult dose)? A. The pediatric for mulation of Engerix- B\u00ae is not licensed by the Federal Drug Adm inistration (FDA) for use in adults. A dults 20 years of age and older should receive 1 mL (10 m cg) of either the pedi atric or adult form ulation vents \"Influenza 1 - ACIP unization n.
