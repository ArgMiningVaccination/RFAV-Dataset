DMH contracts with a network of community -based, private providers and also provides direct specialized community services through the: 1) Mental Health Services Division; 2) School Mental Health Program; and 3) Comprehensive Psychiatric Emergency Program. The Department also provides inpatient services at Saint Elizabeths Hospital. Mental Health Block Grant Statutory Criteria Criterion 1: Comprehensive Community-Based Mental Health Service Systems The DMH programs, services and initiatives described under this criterion are organized by relevant Block Grant Aims and the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Eight Strategic Initiatives. Block Grant AIM: To promote recovery, resiliency and community integration for adults with serious mental illness and children with serious emotional disturbances and their families. SAMHSA Strategic Initiative #1: Prevention of Substance Abuse and Mental Illness Goal 1.1: With primary prevention as the focus, build emotional health, prevent or delay onset of, and mitigate symptoms and complications from substance abuse and mental illness. Early Identification and Intervention Services : A number of services are being implemented under the DMH Child and Youth Services Division (CYSD) system of care (SOC). They include services for: 1) women/mothers identified as depressed with children age birth to 2 (Healthy Start Project); 2) children 0 -5 in child development centers with a focus on child and family - centered, and program consultation (Healthy Futures); 3) parents and children age 6 and under who have shown emotional and disruptive behavior across various social settings (Parent Infant Early Childhood Enhancement Program); 4) children in grades Kindergarten through First to enhance school related competencies and reduce social, emotional and school adjustment difficulties (Primary Project); and 5) prevention, early intervention, treatment services provided by the School Mental Health Program. Block Grant AIM: To ensure access to effective culturally and linguistically competent services for underserved populations including Tribes, racial and ethnic minorities, and LGBTQ individuals. Attachment A-1 Page 1 of 31 OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 36 of 345 Mental Health Services Division (MHSD) : This Division provides specialized mental health services that are not otherwise readily available within the DMH service system or the private sector. The service components include a same day urgent care clinic and pharmacy. The specialty teams are described below. The specialty teams are Multicultural, Intellectual/Developmental Disabilities, and Deaf/Hard of Hearing. The majority of intake consumers seen are assigned to the private clinics in the DMH provider network for ongoing care, since except for the specialty teams, long-term community support is not provided. Multicultural Services - This team serves ethnic and regional groups from Asian/Pacific Islands who speak Vietnamese, Chinese and Thai languages. This group makes up 6% of the population served. Ethiopians of different ethnic backgrounds make up 18 -20% of the consumer base. The three (3) major Ethiopian languages spoken by consumes are Amharic, Oromo and Tigrinya. Approximately 60% of the multicultural consumers are Spanish speaking from Central and South American countries. The remaining are consumers from other African, American, Middle Eastern and European countries who are English or French bi -lingual. Some of the DMH certified mental health rehabilitation services (MHRS) providers that serve multicultural and multilingual populations are also Addiction Prevention Recovery Administration (APRA) certified substance abuse treatment programs and facilities. They include: Latin American Youth Center (LAYC) - serves immigrant Latin youth by operating a regional network of youth centers and public charter schools. LAYC offers multilingual, culturally sensitive programs in five (5) areas: 1) educational enhancement; 2) workforce investment; 3) social services; 4) art and media; and 5) advocacy. Neighbors' Consejo - serves the Latino community by focusing on chronic homelessness, mental health, terminal disease, domestic violence, and low income individuals. The programs and/or services include: stabilization -housing; access to recovery after care; and mental health services. One DMH MHRS provider that serves individuals from diverse ethnic communities is also a Federally Qualified Community Health Center (FQCHC). Mary's Center - is an FQCHC serving primarily low- income, immigrant families. It provides compre hensive and integrated health care, education, and social services. A large portion of the services are devoted to pregnant women and their infants in predominantly Latino areas in Ward 1. Intellectual/Developmental Disability Services (IDD) -This team responds to the psychiatric, rehabilitation, and support service needs of individuals with IDD and mental illness diagnoses. The IDD team focuses on the provision of mental health services and psychiatric treatment to the Attachment A-1 Page 2 of 31 OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 37 of 345 adult mentally ill and intellectual/developmentally disabled population in a community -based treatment and supportive care environment as an alternative to institution -based psychiatric care. This team works closely with the Department on Disability Services (DDS) on joint service planning a nd currently has a total of 129 consumers being served, 105 of whom are also enrolled in DDS. Altogether, DMH is currently serving 232 individuals in its community system who meet the definition of co -occurring MI/MR, with 187 of those also enrolled in DDS. Deaf /Hard of Hearing Services - This team ensures that consumers receive the full array of MHRS based on individual need that includes but is not limited to counseling, psychotherapy, community support, medication, etc. They also receive supports such as outreach, home visits, referral to employment, and other services. MHSD staff provides assistance during the diagnostic/crisis screening of children if requested, and provide clinical consultation and education regarding the psychosocial aspects of deafness and the specialized communication needs of deaf/hard of hearing clients/consumers to all components of DMH. One DMH MHRS provider services individuals who are deaf and hard of hearing. Deaf-REACH- is committed to maximizing the self-sufficiency of deaf and hard -of-hearin g people who need special services. It is the only agency in the District whose mission is specificall y to serve deaf individuals facing serious mental illness, developmental disabilities, or other challenges. Programs and services include: community residence facilities, supported independe nt living, community support, supported employment, HIV prevention, day habilitation, and pre-vocational services. Sexual Minority Youth Assistance League (SMYAL) : Founded in 1984, SMYAL is the only Washington, D.C. metro area service organization solely dedicated to supporting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth. Its mission is to promote and support self-confident, healthy, productive lives for LGBTQ youth ages 13 -21 as they journey from adolescence into adulthood. To fulfill this mission, SMYAL addresses five (5) focus areas: 1) life skills and leadership development; 2) counseling and support; 3) health and wellness education; 4) safe social activities; and 5) community outreach and education. During FY 2011 SMYAL provided training on engagement of LGBTQ youth to two (2) DMH child providers (Hillcrest Children's Center and First Home Care Corporation). Emergency Services : These DMH operated services include same day urgent care, psychiatric emergency services, and adult mobile crisis services. Same Day Urgent Care Services - This service, operated by the DMH Mental Health Services Division, is intended to intervene to prevent relapse or full -blown crisis by alleviating presenting problems. Promotion of emotional health is enhanced beyond the services typically provided by a community clinic that serves individuals with major mental illnesses. This is achieved as follows: 1) adult and child consumers for intake may walk -in unscheduled and be evaluated the same da y; 2) there is same day access to a psychiatrist; 3) psychotherapy services are available on a scheduled basis through the Residents' Clinic; and 4) there is also an on -site pharmacy that Attachment A-1 Page 3 of 31 OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 38 of 345serves individuals without insurance, all walk -in consumers who see a psychiatrist can also have their prescriptions filled that day. As of June 30, 2011, the Same Day Urgent Care Clinic served 1,107 consumers. This includes 987 adults and 120 children Comprehensive Psychiatric Emergency Program (CPEP) - provides emergency psychiatric services for persons 18 years and older. This 24 -hour program includes: crisis assessment and stabilization; acute psychiatric and medical screening and assessment; observation and intensive psycho -pharmacological and psychotherapeutic services. There are four (4) components: 1) psychiatric emergency services (PES); 2)extended observation beds (EOB); 3) adult mobile crisis services (MCS); and 4) homeless outreach services (see Criterion 4). Psychiatric Emergency Services (PES) and Extended Observation Beds (EOB) - includes two (2) observation beds (used for consumers who may need additional time to stabilize before discharge to the community )and two (2) restraining beds (reserved for persons who present a danger to self or others). These individuals are usually escorted by police and admitted involuntarily. Restrained consumers require one -on-one observation and monitoring and in some instances, require staff to handle their violent or combative behavior. As of June 30, 2011, there were 2,946 individuals who received psychiatric emergency services. Adult Mobile Crisis Services (MCS) - is staffed by a multidisciplinary team and offers crisis intervention and medical support to adults who are mentally ill in their homes, community facilities, and in the street . The daily hours of operation are 9:00 a.m. - 1:00 a.m. MCS works closely with the police. The primary activities include: 1) respond to adults throughout the District who are experiencing a psychiatric crisis and are unable or unwilling to travel to receive mental health services; 2) spend as much time as needed with consumers to ensure crisis stabilization, make an appropriate disposition, and provide necessary follow -up service s; 3) be available to address the concerns of the individual in crisis, family members, concerned citizens, mental health providers, and other referring agencies; and 4) offer a range of se rvices including but not limited to on - site crisis intervention and stabilization, assessment for voluntary and involuntary hospitalization, and linkage to other services such as ongoing mental health care, crisis beds, substance abuse detoxification and treatment, and medical care. As of June 30, 2011, there were 1,585 service responses, of which 1,450 were face -to-face. In addition to the Same Day Urgent Care Clinic, CPEP adult MCS, the DMH CYSD contracts for child and youth mobile crisis services. DMH also contracts with Children's Nation al Medical Center for child emergency services. Other Activities Leading to Reduction of Hospitalization :The DMH has a number of programs and initiatives in place that lead to a reduction in hospitalization. Attachment A-1 Page 4 of 31 OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 39 of 345 Crisis Stabilization - Each Core Service Agency (CSA) must have an on -call system for crises and provide a crisis plan for each consumer in their Individual Recovery Plan (IRP). The Access HelpL ine also receives referrals for crisis services. Crisis Beds - The DMH currently funds two (2) providers for a total of 15 crisis beds. These include eight (8) at Jordan House and seven (7) at Crossing Place. At the end of June 2011, total utilization rate was 88.21 %. Local Hospitals for Acute Care - DMH continues to use local hospitals to provide acute care for involuntary patients, as well as voluntary admissions. Peer Transition Specialists - During FY 2010, the Office of Consumer and Family Affairs, Saint Elizabeths Hospital, and the Integrated Care Division collaborated on the implementation of this initiative aimed at helping consumers leave the Hospital. The role of the Peer Transition Specialists (PTS) is to assist individuals in the care of the Hospital, who have been determined ready for discharge, make a smooth transition to community living. In FY 2010, ten (10) PTS were hired and trained and 8 were working in FY 2011. The PTS are able to draw upon lived experiences as well as their training to provide encouragement and support to those who are returning to the community. This initiative is supported with Olmstead funding. Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) - This evidence -based practice provides intensive, integrated, rehabilitative, community-based services for adults with SMI. ACT consumers typically have experienced multiple psychiatric crises, housing and employment instability, and have been unable to maintain linkages to traditional clinic -based mental health services. ACT services are provided to consumers in accordance with an IRP developed in collaboration with the consumer, ACT team, and other involved service providers, family members or community support systems. As of June 30, 2011, there were 13 provider ACT teams serving 1,091consumers. DMH conducts its own fidelity assessments on an annual basis utilizing the Dartmouth Assertive Community Treatment Scale (DACTS); results are tabulated and provided to ACT providers. Each team must provide an improvement plan for low Fidelity scores and any system related issues identified through the Fidelity process will be addressed in an overall ACT work plan and carried out through the course of the fiscal year. Integrated Care Division (ICD) - is dedicated to reducing the inpatient census/reducing admissions at Saint Elizabeths Hospital (SEH) by identifying consumers who need a comprehensive array of services that include mental health, non-mental health, and informal supports to integrate to their fullest ability in their communities and families. ICD coordinates, manages, and evaluates the care for these consumers to improve their quality of life and tenure in a community setting. The target population includes: 1) consumers who are discharge ready but who are reluctant to leave and/or have complex needs; 2) consumers who are discharge ready and have been at SEH for 6 months or more; and 3) consumers who have been admitted to an inpatient setting three (3) or more times in the 12 -month period immediately prior to the current hospitalization. The overall goal is to reduce the census at SEH by avoiding admissions through more intensive community supports and facilitating discharge for the targeted populations. The Attachment A-1 Page 5 of 31 OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 40 of 345 ICD is actively involved in the assessment of SEH consumers who should be referred to communit y-based ACT teams. The ICD also oversees the Integrated Community Care Project (ICCP), operated under contract by New Directions at Washington Hospital Center . Intensive discharge planning and coordination is required to develop the most person-centered, comprehensive plan for successful community living. This planning takes 1 -4 months including the consumer and the consumer's family/guardian, SEH staff, New Directions, and any community vendors who will also deliver services, with support from the ICD. Federal and District Performance Indicators - Complying with federal and the Dixon Exit Criteria challenged DMH to establish baseline measures to effect adult and child System of Care improvements to meet the following performance targets: 1) decrease the number of children/youth and adults re -admitted to inpatient care within 30 days of discharge; 2) decrease the number of children/youth and adults re -admitted to inpatient care within 180 days of discharge; and 3) eighty (80%) of children/youth and adults discharged from inpatient care must be seen within seven (7) days in non -emergency outpatient setting. Community Support vs. Case Management Services : Under the MHRS program DMH and its providers bill for Community Support and not Case Management. DMH strives to create an effective, welcoming, community support system that is based on the consumer's strengths and choices, promotes recovery through the attainment of individualized goals to help the consumer develop the skills to live the best possible quality of life, and provides aggressive outreach to maintain consumers in the community. The DMH provides community support to consumers in a number of ways by both DMH practitioners and private providers and is based on the individual consumer's (child/youth or adult) treatment needs as determined through the individualized recovery planning process where attainable and mutually agreeable goals and objectives are developed. Each consumer is assigned a clinical manager and qualified practitioner to coordinate consumer care, often across multiple provider agencies and to provide rehabilitation services, treatment and supports. The consumer's clinical manager is responsible for assessing with the consumer each of the consumer's major life domains and the areas of need that will be addressed. Goal 1.2: Prevent or reduce consequences of underage drinking and adult problem drinking. Four (4) DMH certified MHRS providers (2 child and youth serving CSAs and 2 adult CSAs) are also Addiction Prevention Recovery Administration (APRA) certified Substance Abuse Treatment Programs and Facilities . Goal 1.3: Prevent suicides and attempted suicides among populations at high risk, especially military families, LGBTQ youth, and American Indians and Alaska Natives. During FY 2011, a course was offered through the DMH Training Institute by The Trevor Project on \"Reducing Suicide among LGBTQ Youth: Research, Public Policy and Educational Programming. There were 23 attendees. Also, the Sexual Minority Youth Assistance League (SMYAL) has received a mini -grant under the DMH SAMHSA State/Tribal Youth Suicide Prevention Grant. Attachment A-1 Page 6 of 31 OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 41 of 345 The District's Behavioral Health Assessment and Plan describes suicide prevention initiatives in section J. This description includes the: 1) 2009 Suicide Prevention Plan (Attachment J-1); 2) SAMHSA State/Tribal Youth Suicide Prevention Grant awarded in FY 2010 (Capital CARES); 3) DMH Access HelpLine Suicide Lifeline Network; and 4) collaboration with the Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority (WMATA) to address suicide prevention within the public transportation system. Goal 1.4: Reduce prescription drug misuse and abuse. Saint Elizabeths Hospital monitors the use of benzodiazepine prescription use for more than 90 days. SAMHSA Strategic Initiative #2: Trauma and Justice Goal 2.1: De velop a comprehensive public health approach to trauma During FY 2011, five (5) courses were offered through the DMH Training Institute on trauma related issues. They included: 1) creating cultures of trauma informed care; 2) trauma recovery and empowerment profile (TREP); 3) working with adult survivors of trauma; 4) staff support training in trauma informed care; and 5) updates on diagnosis and treatment of psychological trauma. The attendance across the 5 courses ranged from 21 -50, for an average of 34 attendees. Goal 2.2: Make screening for trauma and early intervention and treatment common practice. In Ap ril 2007, Saint Elizabeths Hospital (SEH) launched a Trauma -Informed Care (TIC) Training Initiative with support from Joan Gillece, Ph.D., National Technical Assistance Center National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors (NASMHPD). This initiative involved five (5) mandatory all staff trainings. The events through FY 2011 include the following: 1) TIC training for all clinical staff as part of new employee orientation, required annually for all clinical staff, and added as part of non -clinical staff employee orientation; 2) all nursing shifts trained, Comfort Plan introduced, sensory items provided and consultations with staff and patients provided; 3) Comfort Plan becomes an official Hospital chart document and is completed and updated as needed by nursing staff; 4) a ll Hospital units have private rooms for patients and a Comfort Room ; and 5) NASMHPD conducted training on Trauma, Addiction, Mental Health and Recovery (TAMAR); a 15 -session, manualized, supportive and psychoeducational group therapy for trauma survivors focused on affect modulation. Goal 2.3: Reduce the impact of trauma and violence on children, youth, and families. Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral (TF-CBT) : This psychotherapeutic intervention is designed to help children, youth, and their parents overcome the negative effects of traumatic life events such as child sexual or physical abuse; traumatic loss of a loved one; domestic, school, or community violence; or exposure to disasters, terrorist attacks, or war trauma. The Attachment A-1 Page 7 of 31 OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 42 of 345 program can be provided to children 3 to 18 and their parents by trained mental health professionals in individual, family, and group sessions in outpatient settings. The DMH Child and Youth Services Division (CYSD) launched a TF-CBT initiative in FY 2009 by training 10 providers in this evidence -based model. Many of the providers lost the capacity due to staff turnover. Currently, three (3) core service agencies (CSAs) provide TF -CBT (Community Connections, Latin American Youth Center, and Family Matters). In FY 2011, a new Trauma Learning Collaborative (TLC) project called TLC DC II began for the child and youth Choice Providers. The training timeline includes the: 1) pre-work phase (July -December 2011); 2) learning sessions and action periods (January -September 2012); and 3) evaluation (October-December 2012). Homicide Survivor Response Project : Mobile Crisis Services (MCS) is partnering with the Executive Office of the Mayor (EOM) Office of Victim Services and the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) to provide 24 -hour response to homicide survivors following homicides in the District. MCS provides homicide survivors with initial non -medical stabilization and mental health assistance, including linkage to ongoing grief and loss counseling and/or other mental health care. If a homicide survivor is experiencing a psychiatric crisis, MCS can assess the individual a nd link them to the appropriate level of psychiatric care. MCS is able to provide follow-up services including: completing linkages to ongoing grief and loss and/or other mental healt h care (when appropriate), providing transportation to initial appointments, accompanying family members to the medical examiner's office (when asked), and attending vigils and funerals (when asked). Goal 2.5: Reduce the impact of disasters on the behavioral health of individuals, families, and communities. Disaster Mental Health : While DMH responded to local emergencies, disasters or participated in full scale exercises, it did not establish a Director for Disaster Mental Health until 2007. This role ensures DMH's capacity to support 10 of the 16 Emergency Support Functions (ESF) identified in the District of Columbia Response Plan (DRP) and National Response Framework (NPF) in the event of a public emergency or disaster in the District. In addition, the Director oversees DMH safety and continuity of operations. District agency partners include the Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency (HSEMA), Department of Health's Health Emergency Preparedness Response Agency (HEPRA), and the Department of Human Services (DHS). In FY 2011 a new partnership was formed with the D.C. State Mental Health Planning Council. This partnership began with the kick-off session that launched the D.C. Mental Health First Aid Program and will continue with funding in FY 2012. The primary activities include: 1) provide Disaster training for DMH's Emergency Response Teams, and volunteers; 2) develop a Training Plan for DMH Disaster Response and update DMH's All Hazards Response Plan and Continuity Plan; 3) build capacity for a Mental Health response within the FEMA Region III states; and 4) fund Disaster Mental Health training opportunities. Also, a Disaster Mental Health training series was launched in FY 2010 and continued in FY 2011that included: Advanced Psychological First Aid (PFA) with Special Attachment A-1 Page 8 of 31 OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 43 of 345 Populations; Abuse and Suicide Prevention; Intervention and Postvention in Disasters; Stress Management and Self Care; Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM) and Nature and Recognition of Post Traumatic Syndromes; Disaster Mental Health Screening and Assessment; and Core Principles of Crisis Counseling Program. SAMHSA Strategic Initiative #3: Military Families Goal 3.3: Promote the behavioral health of military families with programs and evidence- based practices that support their resilience and emotional health and prevent suicide. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Department of Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (VASH) Program : In 2008, HUD -VASH began a cooperative partnership that provides long-term case management, supportive services and permanent housing to vulnerable veterans who are homeless. The District's effort is led by Department of Human Services (DHS). The 2011 Point in Time Survey identified 515 veterans living in the District. Of that number, 42% report experiencing a mental health issue, 1 in 3 report living with a physical health disability, and 2 in 5 report living with a chronic health condition. In 2010, 105 of the most vulnerable, veterans who were chronically homeless living with serious medical conditions were housed. The VASH- Plus approach customized the process to reduce the wait times for being housed, bringing it in line with the housing first model. Currently, there are approximately 150 units of transitional housing and more than 200 units of permanent supportive housing (PSH) for veterans who are formerly homeless. The DMH Homeless Outreach Program (HOP) has partnered with DHS to identify eligible veterans who are homeless for the VASH voucher program. DHS received these vouchers through an agreement with the Veterans Administration. HOP's role is to provide outreach, engag ement, and referral services. Veterans Family Reunification Project : This project was implemented by Positive Kinship Bonding (PKB), supported by FY 2010 Mental Health Block Grant funds and implemented in FY 2011. The purpose of the project is to enhance the family reunification process for formerly homeless veterans enrolled at the Southeast Veterans Service Center (SEVSC) through counseling and referral services. The target population includes both male and female veterans enrolled at the SEVSC and Chesapeake Veterans House. The participants range in age from 25 -50. PKB provides 1:1 counseling, group counseling/therapy and information/educational sessions to discuss various issues facing veterans during the reunification process. Planning meetings are held with veterans to discuss ways to engage family members and friends toward building a strong social network that would provide ongoing support. Events are also planned to bring the veterans together with each other and their significant others. These events include a \"dinner for two\", sporting events, local recreational activities, movie night and health and fitness activities. The case management staff at SEVSC (where appropriate) will be invited to attend and participate. All events are processed during group therapy/counseling sessions held weekly by the PKB licensed professional staff.

Health Reform Implementation Committee (HRIC) : The HRIC was established to ensure the smooth implementation of health reform in the District. The planning efforts related to implementation of the Affordable Care Act will be coordinated and planned through the HRIC and its subcommittees. The HRIC is further discussed in Section N of this Application. Health Home Planning Initiative : This initiative began in FY 2011 and is a partnership between the Department of Health Care Finance (DHCF), the Department of Health (DOH), and the Department of Mental Health (DMH). The objective is to obtain a planning grant from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to determine the feasibility of implementing a health home in the District. The HRIC and this planning initiative is further discussed in Section N of this Application. Goal 5.5: Foster the integration of primary and behavioral health care. Office of Accountability Quality Improvement Initiatives : The DMH Office of Accountability (OA) is implementing two (2) initiatives related to the integration of primary and behavioral health care: Co-morbidity Reviews - The purpose is to ensure that medical/physical as well as, psychiatric patient care needs are fully integrated and documented in the record of Saint Elizabeths Hospital patients. Quality Improvement Initiative - Medical Co -Morbidit y- The purpose is to increase the number of community consumers linked to primary care providers. Chronic Care Initiative in Mental Health: The D.C. Chronic Care Initiative (CCI) primary goal is to improve the health status of adults with SMI in the District who have chronic disease or who are at high risk for developing chronic illness due to modifiable risk factors. This project is discussed in more detail in the step 1 of the Plan. Integration of Mental Health Services into Primary Care Settings : DMH work ed with Georgetown University Department of Psychiatry and the District of Columbia Primary Care Association (DCPCA) to identify different strategies to link primary and behavioral health care. This project is discussed in more detail in the step 1 of the Plan. Mental Health Block Funded Health Related Projects : FY 2010 and FY 2011 funded projects that address mental health and primary health issues include: 1) a health promotion campaign specifically for homeless men and women, 2) mental health services for low income seniors to improve their mental and physical health; 3) trainings on HIV/AIDS/STI and pregnancy prevention for transition age youth and the professionals who work with the m;4) support services for children/youth with SED and co-morbid health issues; 5) combining resiliency principles with culinary arts and dance to promote wellness for youth; and 6) support services Attachment A-1 Page 12 of 31 OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 47 of 345 including nutrition and fitness for families with children diagnosed with ADHD who are also obese or at -risk of becoming obese. Strategic Initiative #6: Health Information Technology Goal 6.1: Develop the infrastructure for interoperable EHRs, including privacy, confidentiality, and data standards. The District's strategy for interoperable EHR, including health information exchange and health insurance exchange will be developed under the auspices of the HRIC, which is further described in Section N of this Application. The DMH plans for a new practice management system, which would include an EHR, are described in Section E of this Application. Goal 6.2: Provide incentives and create tools to facilitate the adoption of HIT and EHRs with behavioral health functionality in general and specialty health care settings. In 2007, the District of Columbia Regional Health Information Organization (DC RHIO) initiative was launched to create a regional health information exchange (HIE) framework, infrastructure, and system. The core objective of the initiative was to enable multiple hospitals, clinics, and other health care institutions to rapidly and securely access medical history information about patients, so as to yield improvements in the health of the population, enhance the patient experience of care (including quality, access, and reliability); and reduce, or at least control, the per capita cost of care. The DC RHIO was funded via a 3 yea r grant award from the District and managed by the District of Columbia Primary Care Association (DCPCA). The Center for Health Information and Decision Systems (CHIDS) at the Robert H. Smith School of Business, University of Maryland College Park developed a multi dimensional assessment model for the DC RHIO, evaluated its performance along multiple areas and offered a set of recommendations to guide DC RHIOs future evolution. The research and associated recomm endations are based on the information and documents provided by key stakeholders of the DC RHIO, an environmental scan of HIE efforts across the nation, best practices published in the literature, and benchmarking with three (3) leading HIE efforts. These activities are described in the September 2010 report, \"The District of Columbia Regional Health Information Organization (DC RHIO) Current Progress and the Road Ahead.\" The District's work on HIT and EHR, will be coordinated through the HRIC as further discussed in section N of this Application. DMH's plans for a practice management system that would include an EHR are described in Section E of this Application. There is legislation pending before the District Council that would amend the District's Mental Health Information Act to facilitate sharing of mental health information with primary and specialty health providers. Once enacted, this will remove a barrier to full participation in the RHIO and other health information exchanges as well as facilitate integration of primary and behavioral healthcare. Attachment A-1 Page 13 of 31 OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 48 of 345 Block Grant AIM: To increase accountability for behavioral health services through uniform reporting on access, quality, and outcomes of services. SAMHSA Strategic Initiative #7: Data, Outcomes, and Quality Goal 7.1: Implement an integrated approach for SAMHSA's collection, analysis, and use of data. During FY 2011, DMH continued to engage in data development, integration and tracking activities. One example is the development of the Child and Youth Dashboard. This initiative grew out of the DMH Child and Youth Services Division (CYSD) need to engage in better monitoring of access to services, as well as better monitoring of service delivery. Also, during FY 2011, the District's Medicaid, health and mental health agencies began a Health Home Planning Initiative. The data development issues involved: 1) identifying the mental health consumers who were frequent users of primary health services (inpatient care facilities except Saint Elizabeths Hospital); 2) their service utilization patterns regarding health problems and medications; 3) service utilization regarding mental health problems including whether they were connected to the DMH Integrated Care Division; and 4) costs associated with mental health and primary health. This is further described in Section N of this Application. The description of projects that follows is related to SAMHSA collection, analysis and use of data. Data Infrastructure Grant (DIG) : The DIG helps DMH develop the infrastructure needed to support uniform data reporting along other State Mental Health Agencies (SMHAs) and across local agencies for quality improvement. The primary D IG goals are to: 1) ensure data integrity and create an information system storage and retrieval capacity; 2) develop infrastructure to support quantitative planning and service quality improvement; 3) develop a management information system that is compliant with the SAMHSA National Outcome Measures (NOMs) and Uniform Reporting System (URS) requirements; 4) administer an annual Mental Health Statistics Improvement Program (MHSIP) Consumer Perception of Care Survey. This survey is conducted with both adults served by the District's mental health system and parents and guardians of children and adolescents who receive services. Two of the NOMs are derived from the MHSIP, the assessment of Functioning and Social Connectedness. DMH has made significant progress in increasing the capacity to collect data that has not been collected in the past from independent mental health programs that are not linked to the main information system claims database. Enhancements have been made to capture supported employment, supported housing, employment status, living arrangement, medication status, and evidenced -based practices. Details about the Mental Health Statistics Improvement (MHSIP) surveys and the CSR surveys are included in Section F of this Application. Attachment A-1 Page 14 of 31 OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 49 of 345 Goal 7.2: Create common standards for quality of care, outcomes measurement, and data collection to better meet stakeholder needs. Community Services Review (CSR) : DMH established a Community Services Review Unit within the Organizational Development Division, Office Programs and Policy in FY 2009. This Unit performs a major role in the formal Dixon CSR reviews by providing logistical support for DMH reviewers and helping to provide reviewer training. It has also provided focused reviews and created targeted technical assistance interventions to assist the provider network with clinical practice issues. Details about the FY 2011 reviews are included in Section F of this Application. Provider Scorecard : In FY 2010, the Office of Accountability (OA) implemented the Provider Scorecard that was piloted in FY 2009. Further details about the Provider Scorecard are found in Section F of this Application. Applied Research and Evaluation (ARE) Unit : The DMH ARE Unit within Organizational Development has been providing data since October 2009. This Unit implements both measure ment and capacity -building activities that enhance the use and application of data to improve system functioning and quality of care. Further details about ARE and its activities are included in Section F of this Application. Saint Elizabeths Hospital Data Analysis and Reporting : Provides ongoing quantitative data to the hospital, DMH, and other stakeholders in order to enhance the quality of clinical practice and performance. Further details about the Saint Elizabeths Hospital data reporting activities is included in Section F of this Application. Strategic Initiative #8: Public Awareness and Support Goal 8.1: Increase public understanding of mental and substance use disorders and how to access treatment and recovery supports for behavioral health conditions. D.C. Mental Health First Aid Program : During FY 2011, the D.C. State Mental Health Planning Council (D.C. SMHPC) used Mental Health First Aid, a public education program that introduces participants to risk factors and warning signs of mental health problems, their impact, and common treatments; to launch the Judge Aubrey E. Robinson, Jr. Memorial Mental Health Lecture Series. The D.C. SMHPC developed the District of Columbia Mental Health First Aid (D.C. MHFA) Program and p artnered with the Department of Mental Health (DMH) on its implementation. The components of the program include: 1) a 4 -hour Kick -Off to introduce the concept to up to 100 participants (May 2011); 2) four (4) community orientation sessions throughout the District for up to 50 participants each (June -August 2011); and 3) a 12 -hour Certificate Course for up to 30 participants (September 2011). DMH will add a second 12 -hour Certificate Course also in September. The National Council for Community Behavioral Healthcare conducts all program components. The D.C.

The grant programs repre sented are teen pregnancy prevention, family mentoring home visits for sanctioned customers, employment training, summer health and wellness for youth, and employment programs for job search and development. The D.C. Mental Health First Aid Program will conduct a pr esentation at this Conference on August 5, 2011. D.C. Public Libraries : The D.C. Mental Health First Aid Program will conduct a presentation for library services employees at all levels. Most of the District libraries serve many diverse custome rs because they are a public facility. Individuals who are homeless and/or who have mental he alth issues constitute a large portion of the library customers. The District Public Libraries want to be able to understand how to interact with these customers, maintain a safe workplace , and provide them with available resources. This presentation will be conducted on August 11, 2011. D.C. Mental Health First Aid Expansion Program : The D.C. Mental Health First Aid Expansion Program will receive Homeland Security funding in FY 2012. It will include twelve (12), 12-hour courses and one (1) Instructor's Course. Criterion 2: Mental Health System Data Epidemiology DMH has reported in the Block Grant the estimates of the need for mental health services based on the original 1999 and 2003 edition of the Study of Mental Health Need and Services in the District of Columbia; conducted by the University of Texas. These estimates are based on the National Co -morbidity Survey (NCS) and related surveys and are projected to the District based on data from the U. S. Census. This data is presented under Planning Step 2 in the Application to reference the historical estimation of prevalence. The study Behavioral Health in the District of Columbia: Assessing Need and Evaluating the Public System of Care ( RAND 2010 ) also provides prevalence estimates of mental health. The data sources included national survey data (BRFSS, NSDUH, NSCH, and YRBS ), administrative data, claims data, and data from focus groups and stakeholder interviews. The findings are also presented under Planning Step 2 in the Application. Criterion 3: Children's Services Children's System of Care Plan : During FY 2011, the DMH Child and Youth Services Division (CYSD) continued its efforts to develop and finalize a 3 -5 year plan for children's Attachment A-1 Page 16 of 31 OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 51 of 345 mental health services in the District. The broad goal of the planning has been to look not only at traditional mental health service interventions but also at the public health aspects of early detection, health promotion, and prevention. Some of the specific objectives include: 1) reduce the number of youth in out -of-home residential settings and re-invest saved dollars to expand intensive outpatient services; 2) increase services to the 0 -5 age group; 3) improve the level of family involvement at all levels of the system; and 4) implement a wider array of evidence -based practices (EBPs). The final draft of this 3 -5 year plan has been circulated for comment to stakeholders within the District's child and youth system. The intent is to finalize the plan upon receipt, review, and revision of the feedback provided. Early Childhood Prevention and Intervention Projects: These projects are presented below. Early Childhood Mental Health Consultation Project (Healthy Futures) - This project involves child and family -centered, and program consultation for children age 0 -5. It is currently serving 24 child development centers throughout the District. One (1) early childhood mental health specialist is placed in each center one (1) day per week to help identify children who need mental health interventions. As of June 30, 2011, the project had achieved the following: 1) 359 Early Childhood Teacher/Staff Consultations ; 2) 71 Early Childhood Parent Consultations ; and 3) 34 Early Childhood Presentations/Trainings. The program outcomes from the inception of this project (May 2010) have been positive. Georgetown University is providing project evaluation services. Parent Infant Early Childhood Enhancement (P.I.E.C.E.) - This program targets children ages 6 and under with significant emotional/behavioral concerns who are often disruptive in pre - school, early school or home settings. It provides comprehensive assessments, relies heavily on parental involvement, . and normally lasts 12 -16 we eks for a given child/family. The staff have been trained on two (2) evidence -based practices: Incredible Years and Parent Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT). Social marketing for the program has begun for pre -sch ools, child care centers, physicians, etc. Primary Project - This program is targeted to students with mild school adjustment problems and operates in 13 schools. Utilizing a standardized screening assessment, identified students are then connected with trained Child Associates, who work in child led play interventions for 30 minutes per week over 12 -15 weeks. The findings for first and second years show significant improvement as measured by the Teacher Child Rating Scale or TCRS (Pre to Post) on all four (4) domains including: Task Orientation, Behavior Control, Assertiveness, and Peer Sociability. The program had to be reduced in scope in School Year 2010/2011 due to funding issues. DMH has continued to fund the overall supervision of the program and expects to restore funding in School Year 2011/2012. Services provided by local school systems under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA): The former D.C. Community Services Agency (DC CSA) operated two (2) psychoeducational programs with support from the D.C. Public Schools. They included: 1) the Therapeutic Nursery served children ages 3 -5, and 2) the Psychoeducation Program served children ages 6-12. These programs were transferred to the Child and Youth Services Division in FY 2010; however they ended by June 2010. Attachment A-1 Page 17 of 31 OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 52 of 345 School Mental Health Program (SMHP) : The SMHP began with a SAMHSA Safe Schools Healthy Students Grant that provided school mental health services to 17 Public Charter Schools. In 2002 when the federal funding ended, DMH funded 10 of the Charter schools and expanded into 16 D.C. Public Schools (DCPS/Spingarn Cluster) with appropriated local dollars. The SMHP continued to expand and during School Year 2010 -2011 it operated in 59 schools (50 DCPS and 9 Public Charter). It operates a 2 -tiered staffing model for the 59 schools. The SMHP provides full -time clinician services in the 45 Tier 1 schools and part -time services in the 14 Tier 2 schools. Of the 59 schools, 50 are in D.C. Public Schools (DCPS) and 9 in Public Charter Schools. Decisions about which schools participate in the SMHP program have been made jointly by DMH and staff within the Chancellor's office for the DCPS. These decisions are based largely on school readiness and the availability of other resources (e.g., school counselors and social workers). The SMHP continues its model of providing not only direct treatment but also intervening via consultations with teachers, parents and others. It also provides general information/presentations to staff that are more focused on primary prevention. For School Year 2010/2011, the total number of referrals seen fell somewhat (6%) but there was a significant jump in some key service areas (e.g., family therapy up 24% and home visits up 79%. There was also a sharp 50% drop in the number of students referred for outside services. This is likely reflective of the degree of professional skill that SMHP staff are providing in a wide array of interventions. Also, being able to bill directly also provides an incentive. The SMHP began using the Ohio Scales in School Year 2007/2008 to measure changes in problem severity as viewed by the student, the parents and by staff. The data over the past 3 years have consistently shown a significant reduction of behavioral and emotional symptoms after treatment as perceived by these groups. Wraparound Initiative : This is a family -driven, team -based process for planning and implementing services and supports. Through the Wraparound process, Child and Family Teams create plans that are geared toward meeting the unique and holistic needs of children and youth with complex needs and their families. It is an effort to address the overreliance on the use of psyc hiatric residential treatment facilities (PRTFs) and non -public school placements for treatment and/or education of youth with intense mental, emotional, or behavioral health needs. This initiative is a collaboration between DMH and District child -serving agencies that began with the care management contract to DC Choices in June 2008. The purpose of the contract is to implement community -based alternative services for District youth at risk for or returning from an out-of-home (PRTF) placement and for youth who have experienced multiple placements and/or hospitalizations. The D.C. Wraparound program served a total of 228 children/youth for the period of April 1, 2010 - March 31, 2011. Of this total, 177 were part of the DCPS School Wra paround project and the remaining 51 were from the Community Wrap program, which is directl y tied to children/youth who can be diverted from PRTF s. Establishing a Primary Family-Run Organization - DMH has established a partnership with one (1) Family -Run Organization, Total Family Care Coalition, to ensure that there Attachment A-1 Page 18 of 31 OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 53 of 345 is a family member as co -trainer in tra inings delivered within the DMH System of Care. The Family-Run Organization provides peer -delivered family support to families enrolled in the Wraparound and Child and Family Team process services . The Family -Run Organization will: 1) develop an orientation manual that clearly defines what family voice and choice really mean, and how to maximize the benefits of the Wraparound services for their child; 2) play a key role in the ongoing development of the District Children's System of Care; 3) expand to support and train family advocates for families of children with SED; 4) provide advocates who reflect the cultural and geographic profile of the populations of focus; and 5) serve as a centralized hub for information and referral assistance to families. During FY 2010, Total Family Care Coalition, through a contract with the Children and Youth Investment Corporation Trust, provided peer - delivered family support and 1:1 supervision and coaching for children with SED and their families. The CYSD will continue to offer peer -delivered family support services through Total Family Care Coalition for families enrolled in the Wraparound Child and Family Team process and to suppor t the DMH core service agencies (CSAs) in engaging families. Residential Treatment Center Reinvestment Program (RTCRP) : The RTCRP conducts clinical monitoring for District children and youth placed in PRTFs, which includes DMH, Child and Family Services Agency (CFSA) or any other fee -for-service Medicaid placement. For the past year, DMH has also been monitoring all MCO children and youth after 30 days of placement. The primary activities include: conducting site visits, participating in treatment team meetings, facilitating and supporting discharge planning, and monitoring youth for six (6) months post discharge in the community. Choice Providers : DMH continues to support the concept of a limited number of Choice Providers. The basic concept is to have more comprehensive and accessible services. The six (6) Choice Providers get some additional contracted dollars (ranging from $15,000 - $125,000) that can be used primarily for non -traditional services that are not otherwise covered by Medicaid (flex funds). CFSA has continued to provide funding to support the Choice Provider program in FY 2011. Child and Youth Mobile Crisis Services : DMH continues to contract with Catholic Charities to provide Children and Adolescent Mobile Psychiatric Services (ChAMPS) for children and youth ages 16-21 and their families living in the District including children and youth in foster care placed in homes in Maryland and Virginia. ChAMPS provides on -site crisis stabilization via rapid response (within 1 hour of a call), and whatever follow -up visits needed to stabilize the family situation and/or connect the family to needed support services. The overall goal of the program is to maintain youth in the community and avert inpatient hospitalization, inappropriate use of emergency room services, and avoid placement disruptions. As of June 30, 2011, ChAMPS received a total of 751 calls, of which 547 were deployable, and a response was made to 376 calls with an intervention provided. Juvenile Behavioral Diversion Program (JBDP) : The new Juvenile Mental Health Court began in January 2011. JBDP is a mental health based solution or specialty court that provides intensive case management to youth in the juvenile justice system with serious mental health concerns. The juvenile appears before the court for frequent reviews so the court may stay abreast of the progress. Routine and frequent contact allows the court to address challenges or Attachment A-1 Page 19 of 31 OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 54 of 345 problems as they arise and for community mental health and treatment partners to provide input on a regular basis. Each juvenile is assigned a probation officer for coordinating case management, community supervision and monitoring to guide and support the youth through this process. DMH will provide mental health services . Criterion 4: Targeted Services to Rural and Homeless Populations and to Older Adults Rural: The District of Columbia is urban and does not include any rural areas. Therefore, there are no services targeted to rural populations. District of Columbia Homeless Services Initiatives : The Department of Human Service s (DHS) is the lead agency responsible for the coordination of homeless services in the District, and its policy is informed by the Interagency Council on Homelessness. DHS contracts with The Community Partnership for the Prevention of Homelessness, an independent non -profit corporation to administer the District's Continuum of Care services funded through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) on behalf of the city. Permanent Supportive Housing Plan (Housing First): The District of Columbia embraced the Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) initiative to end chronic homelessness, and toward this end, DHS was charged with implementing a person-centric approach to implement this policy. Permanent supportive housing is a \"housing first\" approach and is defined as long-term, community -based housing that has supportive services for homeless persons with disabilities. The District's mental health consumers were also beneficiaries of this PSH initiative. Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Department of Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (VASH) Program : This initiative is described under SAMHSA Strategic Initiative #3, Military Families. The District's Department of Human Services is the lead agency. The DMH Homeless Outreach Program provides outreach, engagement, and referral services for eligible vetera ns who are homeless that participate in this supportive housing initiative. Homeless Prevention and Rapid Re -Housing Program: DHS and the Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) administer the Homeless Prevention and Rapid Re -Housing Program (HPRP). DHS contracted with four (4) eligibility providers that screen applications for this funding in addition to agencies that will provide case management, housing inspection, and legal assistance. DMH has a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with DHS that allows the DMH Homeless Outreach Program (HOP) to do case finding and screening. The individuals are then processed through one of the eligibility centers that provide intake and assistance in obtaining the services for which they qualify. The HPRP funding for DMH/HOP staff is still available and will likely be exhausted by the end of FY 2011. The DMH/HOP will continue to respond to DHS for continuing HPRP needs in particular and for homeless service assessments in general. DMH Homeless Services : The DMH Homeless Outreach Team works closely with The Community Partnership for the Prevention of Homelessness (TCP). The data from the TCP January 2011 Point in Time Survey indicates th at: 6,546 homeless singles and individuals in families were counted in the District of Attachment A-1 Page 20 of 31 OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 55 of 345 Columbia; 2,509 individuals and families were chronically homeless according to the HUD definition; 305 were unsheltered on the night of the survey; Virtually the same number of persons are homeless who were homeless during the 2010 Point in Time Survey (6,539); and 1,274 were identified as having a serious and persistent mental illness. Homeless Services Activities Programs and Activities : During FY 2011 , DMH Homeless Services included the following programs: 1) Homeless Outreach Program (HOP), 2) Psychiatric Residency Program, and 3) Hermano Pedro Drop -In Center. Homeless Outreach Program -The DMH HOP provides outreach, engagement, linkage, psychiatric treatment and follow-up services to individuals who are homeless. HOP consumers live on the streets, in abandoned vehicles and buildings, in temporary residences as well as low- barrier shelters and transitional programs. Reunification assistance is provided for individuals stranded in the District who are homeless and mentally ill through a collaborative relationship between HOP, Greyhound, and Travelers' Aid. The HOP data for adults and children engaged for the period October 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011 is presented in the table that follows. Adults (unduplicated count) 866 Children (unduplicated count) 95 Adults, Children & Families (face -to-face) 2,344 Psychiatry Residency Training - During FY 2011, the Community Psychiatry/Homeless Outreach Rotation was temporarily suspended, though Psychiatric Residents continued to engage homeless residents a t the Court Urgent Care Clinic and at CPEP. Planning for resuming the Homeless Outreach Rotation occurred during FY 2011, and fourth year Residents will be placed in community -based settings (homeless shelters programs, drop-in programs, and street outreach programs). They will also participate concurrently in an academic course on Homeless Outreach and Comm unity Psychiatry conducted jointly by Homeless Services and CPEP. Plans for FY 2012 are slated to have two (2) residents work with homeless consumers once a week for 4 hours; each resident would be at this rotation for 3 months and would serve with either DMH/HOP or a fixed -based homeless service site identified by HOP. Hermano Pedro Day Socialization Program -This program provides a drop in center service for individuals who are homeless to attend during the day when many night shelters are closed. It was designed to offer hospitality services such as laundry facilities, lockers, showers, clothing, breakfast, lunch, service referrals and socialization activities. The referrals include: food stamps, Medicaid, disability benefits, housing referrals, employment and GED, and linking individuals to mental health, health, and substance abuse services. In addition, the program provides counseli ng, transportation assistance, and socialization groups (anger management, addictions), and social activities (movies, etc.). Attachment A-1 Page 21 of 31 OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 56 of 345Children, Youth and Families -The DMH HOP has hired staff to work with children/youth and their families who are homeless. The activities include but are not limited to the following: Regular visits to programs for families and children who are homeless; Make referrals and connect parents and children who are homeless to other DMH programs and services, including as appropriate school mental health, Multi-Systemic Therapy (MST), Community-Based Intervention (CBI), etc.; Provide training as necessary to family providers and the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department (in collaboration with the DMH Training Institute and The Community Partnership for the Prevention of Homelessness as appropriate); Arrange emergency or crisis services as needed; Assist with housing resources as appropriate; Develop Family Emergency Rounds case coordination activity to meet monthly with all providers of family services working with families who are at risk of losing their children, their housing or in psychiatric or substance abuse crisis; Regular participation in mont hly meetings (Family Focus Group, DMH Children's Provider meeting); and Coordinate care with School Mental Health Program staff, Access HelpLine, Mental Health Rehabilitation Services (MHRS) providers, Children's National Medical Center, etc. The anticipated result of this work is that DMH will engage 100 or more children/youth who are homeless each year, which is consistent with target for Dixon Exit Criterion #16 - Engagement of Homeless Children and Youth. The Dixon Court Monitor approved this Exit Criterion in the January 2010 Report to the Court; it is now in inactive monitoring status.

The State's priorities and goals must be supported by a data driven process. This could include data and information that are available through the State's unique data system (including community level data) as well as SAMHSA's data set including, but not limit ed to, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, the Treatment Episode Data Set, and the National Facilities Surveys on Drug Abuse and Mental Health Services. Those States that have a State Epidemiological Outcomes Workgroup (SEOW) must describe its composition and c ontribution to the process for primary prevention and treatment planning. States should also continue to use the prevalence formulas for adults with serious mental illness and children with serious emotional disturbances that have been historically reported. States should u se the prevalence estimates, epidemiological analyses and profiles to establish substance abuse prevention, mental health promotion, and substa nce abuse treatment goals at the State level. In addition, States should obtain and include in their data sources information from othe r State agencies that provide or purchase behavioral health services. This will allow States to have a more comprehensive approach to identify ing the number of individuals that are receiving behavioral health services and the services they are receiving. In addition to in -state data, SAMHSA has identified several other data sets that are available by State through various Federal agencies such a s the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services or the Agency for Health Research and Quality. States should use these data whe n developing their needs assessment. If the State needs assistance with data sources or other planning information, please contact planningdata@samhsa.hhs.gov.

Activities that Support Individuals in Directing the Services Page 41 of the Application Guidance Narrative Question: SAMHSA firmly believes in the importance of individuals with mental and substance use disorders participating in choosing the services and supports they receive. To achieve this goal, individuals and their support systems must be able to access and direct their services and supports. Participant direction, often referred to as consumer direction or self direction, is a delivery mode through which a range of services and supports are planned, budgeted and directly controlled by an individual (with the help of representatives, if desired) based on the individual's needs and preferences that maximize independence and the ability to live in the setting of his/her choice. Participant -directed services should include a wide range of high -quality, culturally competent services based on acuity, disability, engagement levels and individual preferences. The range of services must be designed to incorporate the concepts of community integration and social inclusion. People with mental and substance use disorders should have ready access to information regarding available services, including the quality of the programs that offer these services. An individual and their supports must be afforded the choice to receive services and should have sufficient opportunities to select the individuals and agencies from which they receive these services. Person centered planning is the foundation of self -direction and must be made available to everyone. The principles of person centered planning are included at www.samhsa.gov/blockgrantapplication. Individuals must have opportunities for control over a flexible individual budget and authority to directly employ support workers, or to direct the worker through a shared employment model through an agency. People must have the supports necessary to be successful in self direction including financial management services and supports brokerage. In addition, individuals and families must have a primary decision -making role in planning and service delivery decisions. Caregivers can play an important role in the planning, monitoring and delivery of services and should be supported in these roles. In the section below, please address the following: Either summarize your State's policies on participant -directed services or attach a copy to the Block Grant application(s). What services for individuals and their support systems are self -directed? What participant -directed options do you have in your State? What percentage of individuals funded through the SMHA or SSA self direct their care? What supports does your State offer to assist individuals to self direct their care? Footnotes: OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 89 of 345DMH does not currently offer any services that meet SAMHSA's definition of participant- directed or self-directed services. DMH affords consumers \"choice\" with regard to the selection of community-based providers and individual practitioners. Consumers are encouraged to actively participate in the development of treatment plans. DMH rules and policies relating to consumer choice and participation in treatment planning are attached and marked as Attachments D-1 th rou gh D-6. C onsumers are also encouraged to exercise their rights as further described below. However, the DMH system does not currently afford individuals with opportunities for control over a flexible individual budget and authority to directly employ support workers, or to direct the worker through a shared employment model through an agency. There is a robust consumer grievance system, known as FAIR (Finding Answers, Improving Relationships). FAIR is managed by the Office of Consumer and Family Affairs (OCFA). DMH funds two (2) consumer-run organizations: 1) the Consumer Action Network (CAN); and 2) the Ida Mae Campbell Wellness and Resource Center. Both CAN and the Ida Mae Campbell Center provide training and advocacy support to consumers. CAN and University Legal Services, the District's PAIMI provide support to consumers in filing and pursuing grievances. DMH also funds the Total Family Care Coalition, which is the family support organization. The roles of CAN, the Ida Mae Campbell Center and the Total Family Care Coalition and their roles within the public mental health system are further described in the response to Section L, Involvement of Individuals and Families. DMH also contracts with the local chapter of the National Alliance for Mental Illness (NAMI- DC) to provide a range of family and consumer education and training activities as well as family-to-family support and community outreach. I n December 2010, DMH OCFA sponsored its third Annual Olmstead Conference in collaboration with the D.C. Office of Disability Rights. The theme was \"Community Inclusion- Building Resources and Safety Nets.\" Approximately 250 consumers and staff attended. OCFA will work with the D.C. Office of Disability Rights to plan and sponsor another Olmstead Conference in FY 2012. In 2011, DMH's Training Institute collaborated with the Ida Mae Campbell Foundation to provide additional consumer-focused training. Training topics produced through this collaboration included: Introduction to Intentional Peer Support, Self Employment, Self Advocacy 101, Introduction to Self-Determination, and Introduction to Supported Employment.

Quality Improvement Reporting Page 43 of the Application Guidance Narrative Question: SAMHSA expects States to base their administrative operations and service delivery on principles of Continuous Quality Improvement/Total Quality Management (CQI/TQM). These CQI processes should identify and track critical outcomes and performance measures that will describe the health of the mental health and addiction systems. These measures should be based on valid and reliable data. The CQI processes should continuously measure the effectiveness of services and supports and ensure that services, to the extent possible, reflect their evidence of effectiveness. The State's CQI process should also track programmatic improvements; and garner and use stakeholder input, including individuals in recovery and their families. In addition, the CQI plan should include a description of the process for responding to critical incidents, complaints and grievances. In an attachment, please submit your State's current CQI plan. Footnotes: OMB 345The DMH Office of Accountability (OA) ensures that service standards are upheld according to the DMH vision, mission, values and performance objectives and that mental health care practices adhere with District and federal standards and national state-of- the art practices and evidence-based practices. OA also implements the compliance plan mandated by the Deficit Reduction Act (DRA). OA includes the Division of Quality Improvement (DQI), which is the organizational unit responsible for organizing, directing and coordinating quality improvement of services and supports. DMH does not have a formally adopted CQI plan. However, there is an established quality improvement framework that is used by OA and DQI to organize, direct and coordinate quality improvement of services and supports. That framework is described below. Quality Improvement Committees : There are two standing Quality Improvement Committees at DMH. The first is the Internal Quality Committee (IQC), which was established in 2007. This committee is chaired by the DMH Deputy Director for Accountability and meets monthly. The IQC is made up of representatives from the Mental Health Services Division, the Comprehensive Psychiatric Emergency Program, Saint Elizabeths Hospital, and the Division of Quality Improvement. The IQC is responsible for the ongoing examination of quality improvement issues in the following areas: LOCUS/CALOCUS o Use of this tool for quality improvement in service delivery MHSIP o Use of consumer satisfaction data for Quality Improvement Initiatives Critical Incident Mortality Review Committee o Trending of mortality data with related recommendations for best practices Annual Quality Improvement Initiatives (QII): quarterly and yearly results o Covering defined areas o Data submitted by providers Provider Scorecard o Reflects performance of providers in the areas of Quality, Compliance and Financial o Trending analysis o Reflects various aspects of consumer utilization across the service delivery system The second standing committee is the DMH Quality Council, which was established in 2003. This committee is chaired by the Director of Quality Improvement and its members consist of Quality Improvement Directors from DMH providers. The Quality Council meets quarterly and OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 173 of 345receives direction and information from the IQC. The Quality Council focuses on the following areas: Sharing of quarterly QII results Analyzes LOCUS/CALOCUS data provided by OA Provider reports on quality activities Quarterly provider presentations of significant quality activities and best practice The DMH quality improvement initiatives are guided by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) 2001 report, \"Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century\" which examined the quality of the healthcare system in the United States. The Quality Chasm report developed a framework and strategies for improvements in quality and identified six aims for high quality healthcare and ten rules for the redesign of the healthcare system. The Six Aims are: Safeavoiding injuries to patients from the care that is intended to help them. Effective providing services based on scientific knowledge to all who could benefit and refraining from providing services to those not likely to benefit (avoiding underuse and overuse, respectively). Patient -centeredproviding care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values and ensuring that consumer values guide all clinical decisions. Timelyreducing waits and sometimes harmful delays for both those who receive and those who give care. Efficientavoiding waste, including waste of equipment, supplies, ideas, and energy. Equitable providing care that does not vary in quality because of personal characteristics such as gender, ethnicity, geographic locations, and socioeconomic status. A copy of the letter announcing the 2011 Quality Initiatives is attached and marked as Attachment F-1. Recent Quality Improvement Activities 1. Health and Wellness (Integration of Physical Health and Mental Health) Co-morbidity Reviews - In 2008, OA began a hospital co -morbidity study of consumers with medical and psychiatric diagnoses. The Co -morbidity Reviews are part of the effort to achieve the highest quality of care possible for patients at Saint Elizabeths Hospital by ensuring that medical/physical, as well as, psychiatric patient care needs are fully integrated and documented in the record. The initial audits involved chart reviews and showed some improvement in the integration of medical and psychiatric information in documentation and treatment planning. It OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 174 of 345was determined that the information needed for the audits was transferred from the chart to the AVATAR electronic medical record. The auditors were trained on how to locate information critical to the co -morbidity review (i.e., progress notes, assessments, treatment plans, lab results, vital signs, nursing assessment, psychiatric assessment, physical exam, risk assessments for falls, choking, dementia, and bowel obstruction, and referrals for outside medical treatment). During this process it was discovered that some of the information required for the co -morbidity review was either not present in the electronic record or not fully recorded in the record due to the evolving functionality of this system. The co -morbidity reviews using the AVATAR system were scheduled to resume in June 2011. Quality Improvement Initiative - Medical Co-Morbidity - This QI Initiative to increase the number of consumers linked to primary care providers began in 2009. In FY 2011, the QI Initiative requires CSAs to track two (2) groups of consumers, using a sample provided by DMH. The first group is a random sample of 15 consumers that providers monitor across all four (4) quarters. The second group is a random sample of consumers proportional to the size of the agency. The consumers in the second group will change each quarter. Each CSA reviews these records on a quarterly basis to ascertain whether: a) The CSA has any current documentation on the consumer's general medical condition from the primary care provider and; b) The CSA's IRP includes a plan for addressing medical problems identified on Axis III. This includes the utilization of Schizophrenia Quality Improvement Plan (SQIP) brochures, posters, and handbooks for health teaching. For the purposes of this QI Initiative, general medical conditions should be listed on Axis III. Examples of current documentation from the primary care provider include: a physical examination performed within the year, laboratory results from the primary care provider within the year, current list of medications from the primary care provider. CSAs with consumers in the sample who have an Axis III diagnosis and do not meet criteria (a) or (b) should request the primary care treatment records and revise the IRP to include a plan for addressing medical problems by the following quarter. FY 2010 data for consumers linked to a primary care physician (PCP) shows that during the first quarter 84% were linked, and by year end 97% of consumers had been linked to a PCP. FY 2011 data for the second quarter shows that 73% of consumers had a physical examination in a year, 51% had lab results within a year, and 72% had a current list of medication from the PCP. 2. Provider Scorecard In FY 2010, the OA implemented the Provider Scorecard that was piloted in FY 2009. This process included revision of the tools used to collect data for the Scorecard, as well as site visits and other data collection activities. The OA staff conducted chart reviews at 22 core service agencies (CSAs) in order to collect data for the Quality Review section of the Scorecard. The OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 175 of 345Provider Scorecards assess three (3) domains for each provider: Quality, Financial, and Compliance with regulations. The results of assessments in these areas allow DMH to give each CSA a rating on a Five Star scale. Only providers who could be assessed across all domains were issued a Scorecard in FY 2010. Sixteen (16) providers were assessed across all three (3) domains, and were issued an overall Scorecard score for FY 2010. The overall Scorecard score for each CSA was published among all providers on February 28, 2011. The FY 2011 Scorecard will incorporate revisions based on feedback from DMH Senior Staff and community providers. It will be published to the general public in January or February 2012. Data Reporting Capabilities and Quality Improvement Activities In addition to the work of OA and DQI, as well as the IQC and QC, there are other programs within DMH generating data that is used for quality improvement purposes. Applied Research and Evaluation (ARE) Unit : The DMH ARE Unit within Organizational Development has been providing data since October 2009. This Unit implements both measurement and capacity-building activities that enhance the use and application of data to improve system functioning and quality of care. The Director is also the principal investigator for the DIG. ARE facilitates the use of data within DMH and address es specific questions with research and evaluation methodology. That is, to understand the nature of the data currently being collected, refine and enhance its quality, aggregate it into meaningful new configurations and to design targeted, small scale studies. ARE is comprised of a multidisciplinary team of individuals wit h a primary emphasis on collecting and using data from particular DMH program areas. By looking at the data across programs, program staff will be able to identify resources and strategies being used by other programs to enhance their data collection, utilize methods and IT infrastructure, or collaborate with other program areas. The primary activities include: 1) conduct data analyses and develop reports for federal, state and local programs; 2) keep abreast of the literature and national trends; 3) provide accurate and timely reports; and 4) support quality improvement efforts. Enhancements have been made to capture data for the following programs and/or activities: Care Coordination; School Mental Health Program; Child and Family Services Agency (CFSA) initiatives; Housing; Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facility; Community-Based Intervention; and evidence-based practices. ARE has developed a data reports and deliverable schedule to provide the following reports on a monthl y, quarterly or annual basis: LOCUS/CALOCUS; Key Performance Indicators; Client Level Outcomes Assessment; Child and Youth Services Division Reports; CFSA Utilization; ChAMPS Performance Statistics; Child and Youth Services Dashboard; Crisis Intervention Officer Monitoring; Integrated Care Evaluation; Mental Health Statistics Improvement Program (MHSIP); and URS Tables. The analysis of the MHSIP and the CSR data are included as Attachment F -2. OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 176 of 345Saint Elizabeths Hospital Data Analysis and Reporting : Provides ongoing quantitative data to the hospital, DMH, and other stakeholders in order to enhance the quality of clinical practice and performance. The data analysis and reporting activities include: 1) risk management and unusual incident investigations; 2) hospital wide data collection; 3) database development and management; 4) data analysis and presentation; 4) in-depth studies; 5) performance improvement initiatives and implementation; and 6) audit development and implementation. Repo rts include: PRISM Report- monthly data publication which documents 12-month trends in 17 key performance indicators in the areas of: census, unusual incidents, medication, and clinical practice. Trend Analysis-yearly data publication that presents trends in census, admission, discharge and transfer information, demographic characteristics of the individuals in care, length of stay, readmissions, clinical profile captured in all five (5) axes of DSM- IV-TR, medication related data, and unusual incidents. Analysis results are presented visually in charts or tables, along with bullet points describing key findings and interpretations in every section. Clinical Audits- there are a total of 25 monthly audits, each of which has 12 to 50 indicators. In some audits, the sample size is 20 % while in others; the sample size is two (2) per clinician. Audits include: IRP and multi- disciplinary practice audits - IRP observation, clinical chart audit, discharge, and transfer; Disciplinary audits: initial/update assessments and progress note of each discipline (psychiatry, psychology, medical, nursing, social work, and rehabilitation); and Other treatment related audits: treatment mall facilitation, therapeutic progress note, COD, involuntary emergency medication, tardive dyskinesia, and restraint/seclusion. OMB and CSR Analysis (SAMHSA Strategic Goals 7.1 and 7.2) Mental Health Statistics Improvement Program (MHSIP) Surveys-Adults : 2011 MHSIP Survey- DMH is in discussion with the Consumer Action Network (CAN) to conduct the 2011 adult MHSIP Survey and the Youth Services Survey for Families (YSS-F). 2010 MHSIP Survey- This survey was conducted between October 1, 2010 and December 30, 2010. Rando m sampling (probability sample) was used with adult consumers who received two (2) or more mental health rehabilitation services (MHRS) during the period December 1, 2009 throug h June 30, 2010. In an attempt to mitigate low response rates and inaccurate contact data, oversampling was used. Also, in order to encourage the best possible response rates an incentive ($10.00 gi ft card) was given. Translation services included bi-lingual Spanish/English surveyors and Language Access Line services were also available. The mixed methods design included: 1) four (4) attempts by telephone; 2) surveys mailed after four (4) phone call attempts or for anyone with inaccurate phone information (i.e., disconnected, wrong number); and 3) attempted outreach at point of service (but were unable to fully implement prior to survey end date). The Adult MHSIP Survey was implemented by DMH Contractor, RightSource LLC, who employed adult consumer surveyors from the District mental health system. Sample: The sample overview includes: 1) overall eligible sample 12,843; 2) over-sample 1,119; 3) optimal sample for 95% confidence level (+/-5) 373; 4) surveys completed 355; 5) overall response rate 31% (number of surveys/over-sample); 6) telephone survey 9% success rate per call (2,465/227); and 6) mail survey 30% success rate per mailing (395 mailed/50 returned to sender/120 surveys). Demographics: The adult demographics include the following:1) gender (n=347) with 204 males and 143 females; 2) ethnicity (n=347) with 6 Hispanic and 341 non-Hispanic; 3) race (n=347) with 314 African-American, 7 Caucasian, 18 Other, and 2 Asian; 4) age (n=347) with an age r ange of 18-78 and the mean = 47. Survey: The MHSIP Survey consists of 28 items, rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree). The seven (7) domains include: 1) Perception of Access; 2) Perception of Quality and Appropriateness; 3) Perception of Outcomes; 4) Perception of Participation in Treatment Planning; 5) General Satisfaction; 6) Social Connectedness; and 7) Functi oning. Attachment F-2 OMB 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 180 of 345Positive Responses: The adult consumer percentage of positive responses includes: 1) Overall = 81%; 2) Access = 80%; 3) Quality and Appropriateness = 84%; 4) Outcomes =70%; 5) Participation in Treatment = 78%; 6) General Satisfaction = 83%; 7) Functioning =76%; and 8) Soci al Connectedness =75%. Differences by Demographics and Diagnosis: There were no significant gender differences on the MHSIP domains. There were no significant age differences on MHSIP domains. A trend was observed for differences in participation in treatment. Individuals in the 65-84 age group perceived less participation in their treatment than other age groups. Consumer ratings of satisfaction in this area tend to decline with age. There was no significant difference between African-American and the \"Other\" ethnic group on MHSIP domains. Individuals with psychotic disorders rate the \"Quality and Appropriateness\" of their care significantly lower than individuals with mood disorders. They also tend to perceive lower \"Participation in Treatment.\" Differences in Perception of Care and Outcomes by Providers: A highly significant difference between providers emerged on ratings of \"General Satisfaction,\" with the difference between the largest provider (Community Connections) and other small providers accounting for this difference. A trend emerged on \"Access\" to services with consumers from Life Stride and Community Connections rating \"Access\" the highest, and consumers from Washington Hospital Center (WHC) and \"Other\" providers the lowest. A trend was observed for overall survey results, with Community Connections and Life Stride receiving the most positive average ratings overall, and McClendon Center, WHC, and the \"Other Provider\" group receiving lower ratings. Recommendations for Quality Improvement: The results show a differential pattern of perceived satisfaction based on gender, race/ethnic, and service type and amount. Some of the proposed quality improvement activities for these variables might include: 1) Gender- a. additi onal item-level analyses to determine which specific aspects of access and treatment participation might be perceived barriers for females versus males in the sample, b. training and resource development on assisting male consumers feel comfortable asking questions about their treatment and developing treatment goals, and c. work with core service agencies (CSAs) to develop strategies that will improve access for women (i.e., including transportation, child care, flexible hours; 2) Race/Ethnicity- a. for African-American consumers an area for practice devel opment includes the development of culturally responsive engagement strategies and implementation guidelines and b. A specific resource for the development of a quality improvement initiative is Cultural Competence Standards in Managed Care Mental Health Services: Four Underserved/Underrepresented Racial/Ethnic Groups; and 3) Service Type and Amount- a. provide results to ACT Program Manager for integration into fidelity monitoring quality improvement efforts, specifically assertive engagement component of fidelity scale, and b. build motivational interviewing concepts into training for ACT teams. Attachment F-2 Page 2 of 5 OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 181 of 345 Improvement Program (MHSIP) Survey- Youth: 2010 MHS IP Survey- The Youth Services Survey for Families (YSS-F) used the same proce dures as the adult survey related to: 1) time period of survey; 2) random sampling procedure; 3) oversampling; 4) incentive for participation; 5) translation services; 6) mixed methods design; and 7) contractor. Sample: The sample overview includes: 1) overall eligible sample 2,698; 2) over-sample 1,011; 3) optimal sample for 95% confidence level (+/-5) 337; 4) surveys completed 278; 5) overall response rate 27% (number of surveys/over-sample); 6) telephone survey 12% success rate per call (1,418/167); and 6) mail survey 29% success rate per mailing (386 mailed/34 returned to sender/111 surveys). Demographics: The child demographics include the following: 1) gender (n=273) with 169 males and 104 females; 2) ethnicity (n= 272) with 12 Hispanic and 260 non-Hispanic; 3) race (n= 272) with 255 African-American, 3 Other, and 2 Caucasian; 3) age (n=267) with an age range of 5-18 and the mean = 11.27. Survey: The YSS-F Survey consists of seven (7) domains that include: 1) Perception of Access to Services; 2) Satisfaction with Services; 3) Perception of Positive Outcomes of Services; 4) Perception of Participation in Treatment Planning; 5) Perception of Cultural Sensitivity; 6) Social Connectedness; and 7) Functioning. Positive Responses: The parent/guardian percentage of positive responses includes: 1) Overall = 76%; 2) Access =76%; 3) Satisfaction with Services =75%; 4) Outcomes = 63%; 5) Participation in Treatment = 75%; 6) Cultural Sensitivity = 90%; 7) Social Connectedness = 83%; and 8) Functioning = 64%. Overall survey scores are lower than the scores for adults, at 76%. Differences by Demographics and Diagnosis: There were no significant gender, age and diagnosis differences on the YSS-F domains. Ratings of \"Cultural Sensitivity\" varied significantly by provider. Community Connections and First Home Care had the highest mean ratings. Launch and Scruples had the lowest mean ratings. Ratings of \"Social Connectedness\" varied significantly by provider. Type and Amount of Service Predictors for Parental Perceptions of Care: Higher frequency of Community-Based Intervention (CBI) contacts predicted lower ratings on: Access, Participation in Treatment, Cultural Sensitivity, Outcomes, Functioning and Overall perception of care and outcomes. Higher frequency of Counseling contacts predicted lower ratings on Attachment F-2 Page 3 of 5 OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 182 of 345Participation in Treatment. Higher frequency of Community Support contacts predicted higher ratings on General Satisfaction. Recommendations for Quality Improvement: Rates of perceived progress in achieving outcomes and improved functioning have increased, but continue to be the lowest rated domains for both children and adults. Parental perceptions of involvement in treatment have decreased from 84% in 2009 to 75% in 2010. Additional analysis is needed to determine characteristics of consumers who perceive greater or less involvement in treatment. Also, specific providers should be targeted to improve teaming and engagement in treatment. Certain providers consistently received higher ratings across domains, relative to others. This pattern was particularly pronounced within the adult sample. MHSIP results mirror the Community Services Review (CSR) results. There is a need to: 1) identify and disseminate best practices for high performing agencies, and 2) develop peer learning communities to support development in key areas of practice. Higher rating of CBI significantly predicted lower ratings on mos t YSS-F domains. Additional data needs to be collected to: 1) analyze provider level data; 2) conduct quality reviews of CBI services; and 3) analyze additional CSR data on CBI consumers. Community Services Review (CSR): DMH established a Community Services Review Unit within the Organizational Development Division, Office Programs and Policy in FY 2009. This Unit performs a major role in the formal Dixon CSR reviews by providing logistical support for DMH reviewers and helping to provide reviewer training. It has also provided focused reviews and created targeted technical assistance interventions to assist the provider network with clinical practice issues. Summary of Children/Youth Findings- The Child/Youth CSR was completed in May 2011 - with a total of 87 cases reviewed. Trained DMH staff reviewed 33% of the cases. Human Syste ms and Outcomes (HSO) provided case judging for most of the cases reviewed, including all of the cases that were reviewed by DMH staff to ensure inter-rater reliability. In terms of child status, DMH scored at a 77% level, which is highly consistent with past reviews. Areas of strength continued to be child safety (82%), appropriate home and school placement 91% and physical well-being (97%). The Dixon performance standard measures system performance - with a requirement for an 80% positi ve rating. For 2011, DMH scored at a level of 59%, which is considerable improvement over prior years - 49% (2010) and 48% (2009). Some of the major areas of weakness in past c hild/youth reviews showed marked improvement, including service team formation (59% vs. 45% for last year), service team functioning (49% vs. 33%) and long-term guiding view (48% vs. 32%). Attachment F-2 Page 4 of 5 OMB 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 183 of 345As in prior years, there is large variability in scores across the individual CSAs. It is clear that the targeted training interventions have had a positive impact on lower performing CSAs, but the issue of c onsistency continues to be elusive, particularly for the smaller CSAs. Staff turnover is an issue, as it underscores DMH efforts to create a certification process for the Community Support Worker (CSW) positions within CSAs. Turnover supports the need for continued emphasis on clinical supervision and feedback to CSWs and therapists. Overall, the child review is encouraging but with continued efforts needed. Summary of Adult Findings- The Adult CSR Review was conducted in February 2011 and inc luded intensive reviews of 78 adult consumers of mental health services. HSO continued to oversee the quality and integrity of individual reviews via the case judging process. The overall FY 2011 results for consumer status was that 80% of the cases had an acceptable rating, which is exactly the same as last year. There were three (3) areas that continued to show high marks in the measurement of consumer status; with safety at 88%, living arrangements at 83%, and satisfaction with services at 91%. Areas of social network (65%), education/work (46% and 61%, respectively) and economic security (69%) were identified as areas that need continued improvement. The FY 2011 result for system performance was at 78%, which is very consistent with last year's performance of 77% and slightly below the Court requirement of 80% for system performance. The overall functioning of service teams was up somewhat from last year (63% vs. 60%); Individualized Recovery Plans (IRPs) were acceptable in 78% of the cases, an increase of 4% from 2010. As in 2010, the larger agencies (with a larger sample size) were much more likely to score well. Green Door and Community Connections were singled out as providing \"considerable amounts of quality services.\" The key factor to success appears to be internal CSR commitment and capacity to measure and improve quality practice. HSO made an important finding in noting that for the first time, the problem issues that were frequently identified were more unique to a given CSA as opposed to the system as a whole.

Consultation With Tribes Page 43 of the Application Guidance Narrative Question: SAMHSA is required by the 2009 Memorandum on Tribal Consultation to submit plans on how it is to engage in regular and meaningful consultation and collaboration with tribal officials in the development of Federal policies that have Tribal implications. Consultation is an enhanced form of communication, which emphasizes trust, respect and shared responsibility. It is an open and free exchange of information and opinion among parties, which leads to mutual understanding and comprehension. Consultation is integral to a deliberative process, which results in effective collaboration and informed decision making with the ultimate goal of reaching consensus on issues. For the context of the Block Grants, SAMHSA views consultation as a government to government interaction and should be distinguished from input provided by individual Tribal members or services provided for Tribal members whether on or off Tribal lands. Therefore, the interaction should include elected officials of the Tribe or their designee. SAMHSA is requesting that States provide a description of how they consulted with Tribes in their State. This description should indicate how concerns of the Tribes were addressed in the State Block Grant plan(s). States shall not require any Tribe to waive its sovereign immunity in order to receive funds or in order for services to be provided for Tribal members on Tribal lands. Footnotes: OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 185 of 345There are no Tribes located within the District of Columbia. No consultation is required.

Service Management Strategies Page 44 of the Application Guidance Narrative Question: SAMHSA, similar to other public and private payers of behavioral health services, seeks to ensure that services purchased under the Block Grants are provided to individuals in the right scope, amount and duration. These payers have employed a variety of methods to assure appropriate utilization of services. These strategies include using data to identify trends in over and underutilization that would benefit from service management strategies. These strategies also include using empirically based clinical criteria and staff for admission, continuing stay and discharge decisions for certain services. While some Block Grant funded services and activities are not amenable (e.g. prevention activities or crisis services), many direct services are managed by other purchasers. In the space below, please describe: The processes that your State will employ over the next planning period to identify trends in over/underutilization of SABG o r MHBG funded services1.

State Dashboards (Table 10) Page 45 of the Application Guidance Narrative Question: An important change to the administration of the MHBG and SABG is the creation of State dashboards on key performance indicators. SAMHSA is considering developing an incentive program for States/Territories based on a set of state -specific and national dashboard indicators. National dashboard indicators will be based on outcome and performance measures that will be developed by SAMHSA in FY 2011. For FY 2012, States should identify a set of state -specific performance measures for this incentive program. These state -specific performance indicators proposed by a State for their dashboard must be from the planning section on page 26. These performance indicators were developed by the State to determine if the goals for each priority area. For instance, a state may propose to increase the number of youth that receive addiction treatment in 2013 by X%. The state could use this indicator for their dashboard. In addition, SAMHSA will identify several national indicators to supplement the state specific measures for the incentive program. The State, in consultation with SAMHSA, will establish a baseline in the first year of the planning cycle and identify the thresholds for performance in the subsequent year. The State will also propose the instrument used to measure the change in performance for the subsequent year. The State dashboards will be used to determine if States receive an incentive based on performance. SAMHSA is considering a variety of incentive options for this dashboard program.

The NOMs include: 1) reduced utilization of psychiatric inpatient beds (children/youth and adults discharged and re-admitted within 30 days and 180 days of discharge); 2) use of evidenced based practices (children/youth and adults); and 3) client perception of care (Youth Services Survey for Families and Mental Health Statistics Improvement Program Survey social connectedness and level of functioning). State Measures The District performance measures that have been reported in the Mental Health Block grant are related to the 19 Exit Criteria and performance targets to vacate the longstanding Dixon Court Order. At the end of July 2011, fourteen (14) of these criteria had been moved to an inactive monitoring status as depicted in the chart that follows.

Action Plans: DMH has continued the \"linkage meetings\" between various child-serving agencies and other stakeholders regarding linkages between providers and inpatient care facilities, residential treatment, etc. These meetings serve as a forum for discussion of continuity of care issues and problem resolution (i.e., re-admission to inpatient care, and service linkage leading to discharge).

DMH Adult Services Use of EBPs : The primary EBPs used by the DMH adult serving programs are Assert ive Community Treatment (ACT) and Supported Employment. Issues Related to the Use of EBPs : The District's reporting of EBPs has been somewhat limited in part because the majority of the practices implemented are not Medicaid covered services. The Department of Health Care Finance (DHCF), state Medicaid agency, has submitted and/or is in the process of submitting State Plan Amendments (SPAs) to cover several EBPs. This includes the submission of a SPA to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for Med ication Assisted Treatment (MAT), if approved, will allow for blended funding from Medicaid and Department of Health. Also, proposed SPAs include: 1) Medication Management; 2) Fa mily Psychoeducation; and 3) Screening Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT).

Some of the challenges include: 1) difficulty translating EBPs into a fee-for-service Medicaid service; and 2) inadequate provider networks (e.g., shortage of qualif ied child psychiatrists willing to participate in Medicaid, poor retention of providers trained in EBPs). Goal 3: Client Perception of Care The performance measures reported are the SAMHSA required measures related to social supports/social connectedness and level of functioning. These measures for children and youth ar e derived from the Youth Services Survey for Families (YSS-F) and for adults the Mental Health Statistics Improvement Program (MHSIP) Survey.

Suicide Prevention Page 46 of the Application Guidance Narrative Question: In September of 2010, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and Defense Secretary Robert Gates launched the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention. Among the initial priority considerations for the newly formed Action Alliance is updating and advancing the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention, developing approaches to constructively engage and educate the public, and examining ways to target high -risk populations. SAMHSA is encouraged by the number of States that have developed and implemented plans and strategies that address suicide. However, many States have either not developed this plan or have not updated their plan to reflect populations that may be most at risk of suicide including America?s service men and women -- Active Duty, National Guard, Reserve, Veterans -- and their families. As an attachment to the Block Grant application(s), please provide the most recent copy of your State's suicide prevention plan. If your State does not have a suicide prevention plan or if it has not been updated in the past three years please describe when your State will create or update your plan.

Involvement of Individuals and Families Page 46 of the Application Guidance Narrative Question: The State must support and help strengthen existing consumer and family networks, recovery organizations and community peer advocacy organizations in expanding self advocacy, self -help programs, support networks, and recovery -oriented services. There are many activities that State SMHAs and SSAs can undertake to engage these individuals and families. In the space below, States should describe their efforts to actively engage individuals and families in developing, implementing and monitoring the State mental health and substance abu se treatment system. In completing this response, State should consider the following questions: How are individuals in recovery and family members utilized in the development and implementation of recovery oriented servic es (including therapeutic mentors, recovery coachers and or peer specialists)? Does the State conduct ongoing training and technical assistance for child, adult and family mentors; ensure that curricula a re culturally competent and sensitive to the needs of individuals in recovery and their families; and help develop the skills necessary to match goals with services and to advocate for individual and family needs? Does the State sponsor meetings that specifically identify individual and family members? issues and needs regarding the beha vioral health service system and develop a process for addressing these concerns? How are individuals and family members presented with opportunities to proactively engage and participate in treatment planni ng, shared decision making, and the behavioral health service delivery system? How does the State support and help strengthen and expand recovery organizations, family peer advocacy, self -help programs, support networks, and recovery Consumer and Family Affairs (OCFA) advis es DMH leadership on issues about consumers receiving services in the mental health system. OCFA advocates for education and support of consumer and family member needs for self-management and recovery through budget initiatives, conferences, employment and other appropriate activities. As discussed briefly in section D, the OCFA manages the DMH grievance program, which is known as FAIR (Finding Answers, Improving Relationships). The OCFA devises and encourages initiatives to support peer counseling, wellness/recovery living, crisis planning and family support and has introduced consumer -run programs through various budget and grant initiatives. Consumer- Run/Family Organizations DMH funds two (2) consumer-run organizations: 1) the Consumer Action Network (CAN); and 2) the Ida Mae Campbell Wellness and Resource Center. Both CAN and the Ida Mae Campbell Center provide training and advocacy support to consumers. CAN is an Independent Peer Advocacy Program. CAN's goal is to help guide mental health consumers through the process by promoting recovery and self advocacy. The primary activities include: 1) rights and recovery training; 2) direct advocacy; and 3) grievance resolution. CAN has also provided support to DMH with regard to other services, including consumer satisfaction surveys, consumer self-advocacy, training and outreach. The Ida Mae Campbell Wellness and Resource Center (WRC) is a contracted consumer -run, self -help center. In FY 2011, the WRC provided a variety of supports to consumers including: o training (financial literacy, computer); o workshops (self -advocacy, intentional peer support, self determination and self employment, WRAP); o an annual mental health day that includes HIV/AIDS testing on site; o Mind Body and Soul HIV/AIDS Support Group; o Syringe, Treatment, Advocacy, Resources and Training (START) that reflects the core elements of the harm reduction philosophy adopted by the Westminster Presbyterian Church in the District, and o \"Double Trouble\", a program for addressing issues of both mental illness and addiction. DMH has established a partnership with the Total Family Care Coalition, a family -run organization. Total Family Care Coalition provides peer-delivered family support and 1:1 supervision and coaching for children with SED and their families enrolled in the Wrap Around and Child- Family T eam process, through trained family support partners. See Attachments D- 3, D-4, D-5 and D -6 for further details about DMH policies regarding services to children, youth and families as well as the role of the family support partners in the delivery of services. In addition, DMH contracts with two (2) of the six (6) Healthy Families/Thriving Communities OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 222 of 345Collaboratives (Georgia Avenue and Far Southeast) to provide Psychiatric Residential Treatment Diversion uti lizing the Child and Family Team process. Each of the professional teams includes a F amily Support Partner to provide peer-delivered services to families and their children. DMH also contracts with the local chapter of the National Alliance for Mental Illness (NAMI- DC) to provide a range of family and consumer education and training activities as well as family-to-family support and community outreach. NAMI, along with DMH and the District Metropoli tan Police Department (MPDC), participated in the Crisis Intervention Collaborative, which was established to improve the outcomes of police interactions with people with mental illnesses. The Crisis Intervention Collaborative addresses the diverse professional development needs of officers at various levels of their law enforcement careers. The Crisis Intervention Officer (CIO) Initiative's framework is based on a survey of crisis intervention response initiatives from law enforcement jurisdictions across the country. Since its beginning in the spring of 2009, a total of 287 MPDC officers have participated in the 40-hour training and are now fully certified (of which 266 are still active). The goal is to train approximately 15% -20% of the MPDC patrol officers; currently 8% of patrol officers have been certified. A major part of this training is to help ensure that everyone receiving emergency calls understands why and how to dispatch mental health calls to a CIO -certified office r. In December 2010, DMH OCFA sponsored its third Annual Olmstead Conference in collaboration with the D.C. Office of Disability Rights. The theme was \"Community Inclusion- Building Resources and Safety Nets.\" Approximately 250 consumers and staff attended. OCFA will c ollaborate with the D.C. Office of Disability Rights to plan another Olmstead Conference in FY 2012. Peer Specialists/Recovery Specialists/Transition Specialists The OCFA currently contracts with twelve (12) consumers who work in different areas of DMH. This inc ludes: 1) three (3) in administrative support roles, 2) eight (8) working as Peer Transition Specialists with the Integrated Care Division; and 3) one (1) with the Office of Accountability who has conducted satisfaction surveys for the D.C. Community Services Agency transition process. The Peer Transition Specialists work with consumers who are transitioning from Saint Elizabeths Hospital back to the community, providing support and skill-building activities to facilitate a smooth transition that will result in extended community tenure for the transitioning consumer. DMH has also developed a certification program for peer specialists. The curriculum and program were developed over an 18-month period by a group of stakeholders primarily comprised of consumers with extensive technical assistance, coordination and support from the Division of P olicy Support. . The first training class convened in June 2011. Twelve (12) consum ers were selected for the first class, by a selection committee consisting entirely of consumers, most of who are working in peer counselor or peer specialist roles within the public mental health system. The certification program requires 70 hours of classroom work and 80 hours of field practicum. At the successful completion of the classroom work and field OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 223 of 345practicum, individuals will be fully certified to work as peer specialists. The certification rules are currently pending a legal sufficiency review. DMH plans to access Medicaid funding for certified Peer Specialists by using a billing modifier on existing service codes (e.g., ACT, Community Support, and CBI). The current state plan allows for credentialed, unlicensed staff to bill for specific components of MHRS under supervision of a qualified practitioner. The DMH certification program is designed to satisfy the credentialing requirement as well as the CMS requirements for billing for peer specialist services. DMH plans to offer the certification training annually. OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 224 of 345IV: Narrative Plan M. Use of Technology Page 47 of the Application Guidance Narrative Question: Interactive Communication Technologies (ICTs) are being more frequently used to deliver various health care services. ICTs are also being used by individuals to report health information and outcomes.

Support of State Partners Page 48 of the Application Guidance Narrative Question: The success of a State's MHBG and SABG will rely heavily on the strategic partnership that SMHAs and SSAs have or will develop with other health, social services, education and other State and local governmental entities. States should identify these partners in the space below and describe the roles they will play in assisting the State to implement the priorities identified in the plan. In addition, the State should provide a letter of support indicating agreement with the description of their role and collaboration with the SSA and/or SMHA, including the State education authority(ies); the State Medicaid agency; the State entity(ies) responsible for health insurance and health information exchanges (if applicable); the State adult and juvenile correctional authority(ies); the State public health authority, (including the maternal and child health agency); and the State child welfare agency. SAMHSA will provide technical assistance and support for SMHAs and SSAs in their efforts to obtain this collaboration. These letters should provide specific activities that the partner will undertake to assist the SMHA or SSA with implanting its plan. This could include, but is not limited to: The State Medicaid Agency agreeing to consult with the SMHA or the SSA in the development and/or oversight of health homes for individuals with chronic health conditions or consultation on the benefits available to the expanded Medicaid population. The State Department of Justice that will work with the State and local judicial system to develop policies and programs that address the needs of individuals with mental and substance use disorders that come into contact with the criminal and juvenile justice systems; promote strategies for appropriate diversion and alternatives to incarceration; provide screening and treatment; and implement transition services for those individuals reentering the community. The State Education Agency examining current regulations, policies, programs, and key data -points in local school districts to ensure that children are safe; supported in their social -emotional development; exposed to initiatives that target risk and protective actors for mental and substance use disorders; and, for those youth with or at -risk of emotional behavioral and substance use disorders, to ensure that they have the services and supports needed to succeed in school and improve their graduation rates and reduce out -of-district placements. The State Child Welfare/Human Services Department, in response to State Child and Family Services Reviews, working with local child welfare agencies to address the trauma, and mental and substance use disorders in these families that often put their children at -risk for maltreatment and subsequent out -of-home placement and involvement with the foster care system.

SO ORDERED. BY THE COURT DATE: November 19, 2010 _____________/s/_____________ Lee F. Satterfield Chief Judge Attachments Copies to: Judges Senior Judges Magistrate Judges Executive Officer Clerk of the Court Division Directors Library Daily Washington Law Reporter 2 Attachment N-6 Page 2 of 12 OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 247 of 345SUPERIOR COURT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA Juvenile Behavioral Diversion Program Description Introduction It is estimated that between 65 to 70% of juveniles involved in the delinquency system are diagnosed with a mental health disorder.1 In addition, many juveniles re- offend, even while they are involved with the juvenile justice system. A diversion program would help connect juveniles with a mental disorder to appropriate mental health services and supports and increase public safety. It is ag reed that \"it is crucial that we deal not only with the specific behavior or circumstances that bring [juveniles] to our attention, but also with thei r underlying, often long-term me ntal health and substance abuse problems.\"2 Moreover, a diversion program is consistent with the policy underlying juvenile court, which is the care a nd rehabilitation of children who violate the law, while protecting the community. In May 2010, Chief Judge Lee F. Satterfie ld established an implementation group to develop the criteria and procedures for a juvenile behavioral diversion program. Representatives from the Family Court, the Department of Mental Health (DMH), the Office of the Attorney General (OAG), the P ublic Defender Service (PDS), Court Social Services (CSS), and the D.C. Courts' Res earch and Development Division (R&D) met several times to develop criteria and procedures for the program. Based on its 1 Teplin, Abram, McClelland, Dulcan and and McReynolds, 2004. 2 Shay Bilchik, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Protection, U.S. Department of Justice, Mental Health Disorders and Substance Abuse Problems Among Juveniles (July 1998), available at www.childrensprogram.org/media/pdf/mentalhealthdisorders.pdf. 1 Attachment N-6 Page 3 of 12 OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 248 of 345discussions and information of other jurisd ictions' programs, the implementation group developed the following criter ia and process. The Juvenile Behavioral Diversion Program (JBDP) is established as a problem- solving court. The R & D Division will eval uate the program at the end of its first year of operation to determine its effectiveness. Th e Program is an intensive non-sanction based program designed to link juveniles and stat us offenders to, and engage them in, appropriate mental health services and s upports in the community in order to reduce behavioral symptoms that resu lt in contact with the court an d to improve the juvenile's functioning in the home, school, and community. Priority for admission to JBDP will be provided to juveniles. The Program is voluntary. Program Goals The program's goals are as follows: To connect the juvenile and status o ffender with appropriate mental health services in the community; To provide support for and involve th e respondent's parents, guardian, or custodian in me ntal health treatm ent for their child; To provide a period of engagement with me ntal health serv ices that is monitored by the court in order to increase treatment engagement by respondents and their families; To increase the number of respondents able to remain in the community with the appropriate me ntal health services a nd supports and to reduce the number of respondents who otherwise without such se rvices and support might be detained; 2 Attachment N-6 Page 4 of 12 OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 249 of 345 To reduce the individual's contact with the criminal justice system as a juvenile and later as an adult; and To reduce crime in the community and protect public safety by reducing the number of tim es that juveniles with mental disorders reoffend. Eligibility Criteria The initial hearing judge, respondent's counsel, CSS of ficer, or the Assistant Attorney General (AAG) m ay identify a responde nt who ma y be eligib le for certification from the juvenile calendar judge to the JB DP. The juvenile calendar judge may also identify a respondent who may be eligible. The attorney appoin ted to represent the respondent at the initial hearing shall remain th e attorney for the respondent in the Program. In order for the respondent to partic ipate in the Program, he or she must be available to participate in community-based se rvices. It is not a disqualification if the respondent is in respite care or is placed in shelter care. Age The respondent may be any age under 18 years old. Clinical Criteria In order to participate in the program, the juvenile or status offender must have an Axis I mental health disorder or be at signi ficant risk of receiving an Axis I diagnosis. The respondent ma y also have an Axis II developm ental disability, if he or she is able to participate in the program, but he cannot solely have an Axis II diagnosis. 3 Attachment N-6 Page 5 of 12 OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 250 of 345The Court has available for its considerat ion prior evaluations of the respondent. The program will rely on prior diagnoses and recognizes that various assessment instruments may have been used to make a diagnosis. CSS administers a risk assessment for all respondents who have contact with the court system. If CSS identifies a respondent who is at risk of mental illness and there is no availa ble prior assessment, DMH shall conduct a further assessment of the respondent. This assessment will be completed by DMH at its Howard Road child psychiatry group. Based on its consideration of prior or curre nt assessments for a mental disorder, DMH shall determine whether the respondent has or is at risk of having a qualifyi ng diagnosis. No information learned from the respondent during the course of the CSS screen and the DMH assessment shall be discoverable. Criminal Criteria The OAG will review the following inform ation regarding the respondent: any prior contacts with the court; the na ture a nd circumstances of the prior contacts; the nature and circumstances of th e present contact; and any relevant social factors. If a respondent's charges involve certain offenses, he or she is ineligible to participate in the Program. Attachment A lists the excluded offenses. A respondent may have been adjudicated delinquent in prior cases. However, in the prio r cases, if the respondent was found to be involved in the listed excluded offens es, he or she is ine ligible to participate in JBDP. The OAG reserves the right, based upon the indivi dual factors in a respondent's case, to override any criminal eligibility factor either to permit or decline to allow a respondent to enter any program track. 4 Attachment N-6 Page 6 of 12 OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 251 of 345There are three tracks (Track I, Track II, and Track III). Track I is available for the charges listed on Attachment B. The re spondent does not enter a plea on this Track. A respondent may enter a consent decree and be e ligible to enter on Track I. In addition, generally, the individuals who would be elig ible for this Track must have no prior convictions or have entered any consent decr ees in prior cases. The OAG, however, will always review prior convictions and consent decrees to determine wh ether the nature and circumstances underlying the conviction or c onsent decree, including whether appropriate mental health services and supports we re provided to the respondent, support a determination that the individual remains eligible for Track I. Attachment C lists the charges for whic h a respondent would be eligible for certification to the JBDP in Track II. This Track involves a respondent who enters a plea and is certified to the program pre-dispos ition by the juvenile calendar judge. Attachment D lists the ch arges for whic h a respondent would be eligible for certification to the JBDP in Track III. This Track involve s a respondent who is certified to the program by the juvenile calendar judge at disposition or after a motion to revoke probation has been filed. Certification to the Juvenile Behavioral Diversion Program Prior to certification to th e JBDP, the OAG and DMH shall have determined that the respondent meets their respective elig ibility criteria. CSS will sc reen in the Juvenile New Referrals courtroom. Based on that sc reening, CSS will recommend to the judge in New Referrals whether the respondent should be further assessed by DMH. If a further assessment is recommended, the respondent will be ordered to attend a further 5 Attachment N-6 Page 7 of 12 OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 252 of 345assessment and a date shall be set in the Ne w Referrals courtroom for the assessment at Howard Road. The Court may also order a parent, guardian, or caretaker to attend the assessment. CSS will also notify the OAG of the identification of the respondent based on its screen. The OAG will then review the case to determine whether the respondent meets criminal eligibility criteria. The DMH assessment and OAG's review will be completed prior to the first status before the juvenile calendar judge. If both the OAG and DMH report to the juvenile calendar judge that the juvenile meets eligibility criteria, the juvenile judge will then certify the case to the JBDP judge and schedule the matter for a status before the JBDP judge within seven (7) days. If a juvenile is identified as a candidate for the JBDP when the case is pending before the juvenile calendar j udge, and after adjudication or a plea or post disposition if the juvenile is on probation, the OAG will re view the case to determine whether the respondent m eets criminal eligibility criteria and the DMH will review the case to determine if an assessment is required. DM H shall schedule a mental health assessment at Howard Road, if one is needed. The OAG and DMH review and DMH assessment will be completed within ten (10) days. If the OAG and DMH report to the juvenile calendar judge that the juvenile meets eligib ility criteria, the juve nile judge will then certify the case to the JBDP judge and sche dule the matter for a status before the JBDP judge within seven (7) days. When a respondent is deemed eligible for the JBDP, the Suitability Committee will review the case to determine if the juveni le is suitabl e to participate, including, but not limited to, amenability to treatment and community support. The Suitability Committee shall have all available inform ation regarding the respondent's history 6 Attachment N-6 Page 8 of 12 OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 253 of 345(criminal, medical, educational and social). The Committee will be composed of the following: a CSS officer, a psychiatrist or psychologist, a DMH representative and an APRA representative, as appropriate. Neither the JBDP judge nor counsel shall be present for or participate in the Suitabili ty Committee's review. The Committee shall meet two (2) times a week, or as needed, to review eligible candidates for the JBDP. The Committee shall meet prior to the first stat us before the JBDP judge. The Committee shall provide the judge and counsel with its determination of whether the juvenile is suitable or unsuitable for the Program. If th e Committee determines the respondent is not suitable, it shall suggest appr opriate treatment or service alternatives. The JBDP judge will then certify the respondent back to the juvenile calendar judge with the specific recommendations from the Committee. Diversion Supervision The program involves a multi-disciplinar y approach. Collaboration between involved ag encies is critical. The Program team will determine an appropriate individual plan for the respondent. The plan will be made part of a Participation Agreement entered into by the respondent, respondent's counsel, re spondent's parent, guardian, or custodian, the Assistant Attorney General, and the JBDP judge. The plan will include participation in mental health treatment and reporting to CSS. It may also include substance abuse treatment and drug testing, if appropriate. The judge may order the parents and other caretakers of respondents into parenting classes, family counseling, medical and psychiatric treatment, or othe r appropriate programs. In addition, if appropriate, the 7 Attachment N-6 Page 9 of 12 OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 254 of 345judge will appoint an Education Attorney to assist in addressing th e educational needs of the respondent. The JBDP judge will hold status hearings every two weeks to determine the respondent's compliance with treatment. The co nstant reviews m ake sure that services are in place and service adjustments can be made quickly, as appropriate. The frequency of hearings may change based on the juvenile's compliance. The judge will make every effort not to schedule a cour t hearing more than once a m onth that would require the respondent to be absent from school. At the hearing, the following will be present: respondent; parent, guardian, or custodian; AAG; CSS officer; and a DMH integration coordinator (a cross-trai ned clinician). No statements made by a respondent in the JBDP shall be discoverabl e or used against the respondent in any prosecution. The respondent's participation or lack of par ticipation in the program will be used to determine the respondent's compliance in the program and may be used at any detention or disposition hearing. Prior to the hearing, CSS will provid e a written report on the respondent's compliance with the Participa tion Agreement. The JBDP judge shall determine whether the respondent has successfully completed th e program for Track I and II, based on the judge's judgment that the respondent has s ubstantially complied with the Participation Agreement and any court orders. The responde nt's participation in the program shall generally be for a four (4) to six (6)-month pe riod from the date the formal agreement is entered, but no longer than twel ve (12) months. The judge may shorten or lengthen the period, depending on the compliance and engagement of the respondent with services and supports. 8 Attachment N-6 Page 10 of 12 OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 255 of 345For respondents who were certified to the Program's Track I, at the time the JBDP judge determines that the respondent has completed the Program, the case will be dismissed with prejudice and the proceedings shall thereupon terminate. For respondents who were certified to the Program's Track II , upon successful completion of the program, the Assistant Attorney General will dismiss the case pursuant to Superior Court Juvenile Rule 48(a). For respondents who were on probation when they were certified to the Program's Track III, CSS may recommend that the judge terminate the order of probation at any time it determines that the purpos e of the order has been achieved. Termination Criteria A juvenile who is rearrested on probable cause for any delinquent offense may be terminated from the diversion program. A charge does not necessarily require term ination. The OAG will review the nature and circumstances of the offense and exercise discretion as to whether the juvenile should be terminated. A juvenile may also be terminated from the program if he or she has failed to comply with the diversion program requireme nts for at least 30 days, or if he or she has lost contact with his service provider or CSS for at least 30 days, or a petition to revoke probation has been filed. If the respondent is terminated from the program or decides to terminate her or himself from the Program, the case(s) will be certified back to the juvenile calendar judge. A respondent terminated from Track I will be certified to a juvenile calendar judge for a status hearing. A respondent who is terminated from Track II will be certified to the juvenile calendar judge for dispositi on. A respondent who is terminated from 9 Attachment N-6 Page 11 of 12 OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 256 of 345Track III will be certified to the juvenile calendar or judge from which the referral was made for whatever action deem ed appropriate by the judge assigned to that calendar. This certification may be made instead of, pr ior to, or after a probation revocation hearing and disposition is held. Evaluation of Juvenile Behavioral Diversion Program The R&D Division shall establish performan ce measures to evaluate the Program. The R&D Division shall conduct a one-year eval uation of the Program that will consid er various measures to assess the identified goals, including re-arrests during the period of supervision and after the peri od of supervision ended, comp liance with mental health treatment during the period of supervision a nd after the period of supervision ended, attendance at court hearings, completion of program, and school attendance. The Program will be reviewed to determine whet her protocols and/or processes should be modified in an effort to better serve the best interests of each child, their families, and the community. 10 Attachment N-6 Page 12 of 12 OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 282 of 345 SPECIAL ORDER Subject Crisis Intervention Officer Initiative Number SO-10-07 Effective Date September 13, 2010 Related to: GO-OPS-308.04 (Processing of Persons Who May Suffer From Mental Illness) GO-OPS-309.01 (Barricade/Hostage Situations and Other Unusual Incidents) SO 00-19 (Compliance with Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act) SO 03-09 (Juvenile Mental Health Services), TT 03-076-10 (Transportation of Juveniles in Need of Mental Health Services), effective date 03/23/10 Rescinds: TT 06-073-10 (Crisis Intervention Office r Initiative) effective date 06/22/10 DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA I.

BACKGROUND The Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) created the Crisis Intervention Officer Initiative to provide skills to members t hat are necessary to effectively deal with persons of diminished mental capacity and to provide professional assistance to these individuals. The Crisis Intervention Officer Initiative does not require members to make a diagnosis of whether subjects are mentally ill or what form of mental illness subjects may have, but rather to use reasonable judgment to recognize behavior which is outside the norm in which subjects pose a danger to themselves or others, and their behavior appears to the average person to be caused by mental illness. Attachment N-9 Page 1 of 9 OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 283 of 345 II. POLICY It is the policy of the MPD when handling in cidents involving persons of diminished capacities to de-escalate the situation and encourage professional resource intervention to resolve the encounter in the safest possible manner in the best interest of all the involved parties. Proper intervention techniques can assist in resolving the immediate implications of the encounter and hasten the intervention by professional resource personnel. III.

State Behavioral Health Advisory Council Page 49 of the Application Guidance Narrative Question: Each State is required to establish and maintain a State advisory council for services for individuals with a mental disorder. SAMHSA strongly encourages States to expand and use the same council to advise and consult regarding issues and services for persons with or at risk of substance abuse and substance use disorders as well. In addition to the duties specified under the MHBG, a primary duty of this newly formed behavioral health advisory council would be to advise, consult with and make recommendations to SMHAs and SSAs regarding their activities. The council must participate in the development of the Mental Health Block Grant State plan and is encouraged to participate in monitoring, reviewing and evaluating the adequacy of services for individuals with substance abuse disorders as well as individuals with mental disorders within the State. Please complete the following forms regarding the membership of your State's advisory council. The first form is a list of the Advisory Council for your State. The second form is a description of each member of the behavioral health advisory council. Footnotes: OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 332 of 345DMH in consultation with the District Office of Boards and Commissions has revised the 1988 Mayoral Order establishing the planning council. The proces s of revising the Mayoral Order began in 2010, prior to the change in administration and the issuance of the instructions from SAMHSA regarding establishing a behaivoral health advisory council. DMH elected to proceed with updating the Mayoral Order establishing the Sate Mental Health Planning Council, rather than stopping the process, because the existing order is very old and needed to be updated to reflect the current organizational structure in the District and for use in membership recruiting. As DMH begins to engage in more extensive planning with APRA about behavioral health, we will explore the expanding the State Mental Health Planning Council to include substance abuse and substance use disoreders. The revised order is currently pending signature by the Mayor. After the revised order is issued, DMH will work with the Mayor's Office of Board and Commissions to recruit new members so that all vacancies are filled. A copy of a letter from the State Mental Health Planning Council chairman commenting on the District's FY 2012 Mental Health Block Grant application is attached and marked as Attachment O-1.

Comment On The State Plan Page 50 of the Application Guidance Narrative Question: SAMHSA statute requires that, as a condition of the funding agreement for the grant, States will provide opportunity for the public to comment on the State plan. States should make the plan public in such a manner as to facilitate comment from any person (including Federal or other public agencies) during the development of the plan (including any revisions) and after the submission of the plan to the Secretary. In the section below, States should describe their efforts and procedures to obtain public comment on the plan in this section. Footnotes: OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: Columbia FY 2012- FY 2013 Mental Health Services Block Grant Application will be published on the Department of Mental Health (DM H) website and comments solicited from the public (inclusive of Federal, District and other public and private agencies). Also, DMH will compile a list of specific community-based organizations that will be asked to review and comment on the Plan. The comments will be integrated at the various stages of the planning process (development, implementation, and submission), as appropriate. The D.C. State Mental Health Planning Council served as the first level of review and comments are included in their letter in this Application. DMH and the Planning Council have received input from the Addiction Prevention and Recovery Administration (APRA) related to areas of mutual interests and projects for funding consideration. APRA will be asked to review and provide input on the Plan as their review of this document did not occur prior to the September 1, 2011 due date. Since the District's FY 2012 -FY 2013 Block Grant Application will be submitted to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) before the comment period is completed, for any changes deemed warranted by the Planning Council and DMH a Plan Amendment will be developed. Any amendment will be forwarded to SAMHSA upon completion. Page 1 OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 07/19/2011 Expires: 07/31/2014 Page 345 of 345 "}
