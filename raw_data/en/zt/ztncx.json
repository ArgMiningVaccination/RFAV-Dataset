Participant data from a 2017 national survey on TKM usage was divided into two groups based on the children's TKM use reported by parents. The female participants' children had a higher rate of experience in using TKM (8.1%; p = 0.029). Additionally, 91.4% of the parent group with a child who used TKM turned out to have used TKM, which was higher than 71.9% of the parents whose children never used TKM (p < 0.001). As for the awareness on the use of TKM, 44.0% of the parents with a child who experienced TKM answered they were aware of it, while only 35.3% of the parent group whose child never experienced TKM did so (p = 0.033). The present study suggests that parental experience in using TKM could have an impact on the children's TKM use reported by parents. Further study is necessary to assess which parental factor (awareness level, medical disorder to be treated, therapy, therapeutic efficacy, the purpose of visit, sex, age, etc.) has a close relationship with TKM usage experience of their children.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-04-01", "cleaned_text": "The Use of Traditional Korean Medicine (TKM) by Children: A Correlational Study between Parent's Perception and Their Children's Use Reported by Parents [https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9040385](https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9040385) [Integrative, Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-healthcare-09-00385), [2](#B2-healthcare-09-00385), [3](#B3-healthcare-09-00385)]. CAM approaches include natural products (e.g., herbs, vitamins and minerals and probiotics), and mind body practice such as yoga, meditation, chiropractic, acupuncture, relaxation techniques, tai chi, qigong, and hypnotherapy [ [4](#B4-healthcare-09-00385)]. The use of CAM is increasing in many countries of the world [ [5](#B5-healthcare-09-00385)]. Approximately 88% of the member states of the World Health Organization (WHO) are using CAM through the development of national policies, laws, regulations, and applied programs [ [6](#B6-healthcare-09-00385)]. In East-Asian countries such as South Korea and China, traditional medicine has been the form of medical care treating the diseases of the people. Currently, it is still taking a crucial part in health care along with conventional medicine (CM) [ [7](#B7-healthcare-09-00385), [8](#B8-healthcare-09-00385)]. In East-Asian countries such as China, Korea, and Taiwan, traditional medicine practitioners are considered as doctors, as is the case with the doctors who provide CM [ [9](#B9-healthcare-09-00385), [10](#B10-healthcare-09-00385)]. Traditional Korean medicine (TKM) doctors use acupuncture, electro-acupuncture, pharmacopuncture, herbal medicine, chuna, cupping, moxibustion, and other forms of intervention to treat their patients [ [11](#B11-healthcare-09-00385)]. In Korea, 14% of the total population and 7.6% of those in their 20 s or younger, are using TKM, and 10% of the total male population and 18.1% of the total female population visited TKM clinics [ [12](#B12-healthcare-09-00385)]. The purpose of using TKM was treating a disease (94.1%), improving health (18.4%), and cosmetic purposes (4.0%) [ [13](#B13-healthcare-09-00385)]. [14](#B14-healthcare-09-00385), [15](#B15-healthcare-09-00385)]. Additionally, parents' experience with using medical services can have varying effects on their children [ [16](#B16-healthcare-09-00385)]. Some well-known factors impacting the health and the usage of medical services during pediatric and juvenile periods include respective family structure, parental education level, and their social-economic status [ [17](#B17-healthcare-09-00385), [18](#B18-healthcare-09-00385), [19](#B19-healthcare-09-00385), TCM clinics, and 84.3% of their children used TCM clinics, while 80.3% of them reported that they used both TCM clinics and CM clinics. Yeh [ [24](#B24-healthcare-09-00385)] used the National Health Insurance data of Taiwan to analyze the overall usage of TCM and reported that about 20% of the children under 20 used TCM clinics. In the field of TKM, Choi [ [25](#B25-healthcare-09-00385)] conducted a survey of 300 parents who used the TKM clinic and had a child under 19. As a result of the said survey, it was resulted that 81% of the children experienced and visited TKM clinics for the purpose of treating respiratory disease (21.6%) gastrointestinal disease (10.6%,), and skin disease (9.2%). Park [ [26](#B26-healthcare-09-00385)] surveyed 702 parents who used daycare centres and reported that 55.3% of the children's age from 1 to 13 used TKM clinics, mainly for the purpose of treating respiratory disease (34.5%), gastrointestinal disease (17.2%), and skin disease (13.8%). As such, the previous studies on the usage of traditional medicine among children or adolescents under 20, were mainly conducted as cross-sectional studies. In three studies [ [23](#B23-healthcare-09-00385), [25](#B25-healthcare-09-00385), [26](#B26-healthcare-09-00385)], the study samples were not representative of the general population of the country. Yeh [ [24](#B24-healthcare-09-00385)] used the representative data of the general population of Taiwan. However, the study was intended to investigate the usage of TCM in the entire population, including children. [13](#B13-healthcare-09-00385)]. In order to effectively integrate TKM into the healthcare system, it is necessary that policies are developed and implemented based on accurate statistics of TKM. To fulfil this requirement, the national survey on TKM use data from 5000 Korean participants was used in order to examine the correlation between parental awareness of TKM use and the use of TKM by their children. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Data Sources [https://www.koms.or.kr/main.do](https://www.koms.or.kr/main.do), accessed on 18 November 2020) run by the National Institute of Korean Medicine Development (NIKOM). Approval was obtained to use and analyze the data from the NIKOM, which was commissioned by the government to conduct the above-mentioned survey and analyzed the micro-data which was provided by the said organization to conduct this study. 2.2. Sample Selection [Figure 1](#healthcare-09-00385-f001). 2.3. Analysis Items 2.4. Statistical Analysis 3. Results 3.1. The Information on and Characteristics of the Children of the Participants [Table 1](#healthcare-09-00385-t001)). Regarding the question about their children, 872 participants answered that they had a child (or children) under the age of 19, accounting for 17.4% of all participants ( [Table 1](#healthcare-09-00385-t001)). The majority of these contributors answered that they only had one child that fell into that particular age group (n = 425, 48.7%), which was followed by those with two children in the corresponding age group (n = 393, 45.1%). When asked whether their children had any experience of using TKM over the past 12-month period, 209 answered they had, while 663 answered none (24.0% and 76.0%, respectively). 3.2. The Demographics of the Parents and Their Children's TKM Use Reported by Parents [Table 2](#healthcare-09-00385-t002)). Interestingly, female participants were more likely to have children with experience of using TKM (p = 0.029). Furthermore, the chance of having a child with experience of using TKM was higher in Chungcheong (n = 116, 13.3%) and Gyeongsang (n = 225, 25.8%) areas compared to the capital area (n = 371, 42.5%). Participants in their 50 s (50 to 60 years or older) showed a higher value compared to participants that were 40 years old or younger (30 to 40 years or younger) (p = 0.042). There was also no difference in employment status in terms of the children's TKM usage reported by parents. No tendency of significance was observed with the household income as well. Participants with higher education levels (university or higher education) were more likely to answer that their children had experienced using TKM. However, the difference was not statistically significant. As for the types of government health care coverage, the groups without a child who experienced using TKM had a higher rate of having workplace health insurance coverage. Similarly, the group with children with experience of using TKM had a higher rate of having private medical insurance. However, these differences were non-statistically significant. Additionally, no significant differences were observed based on household income or area of residence. 3.3. The Opinion of the Parents on Using TKM and Their Children's TKM Use Reported by Parents [Table 3](#healthcare-09-00385-t003)shows whether the children's TKM use reported by parents changed depending on the parents' ideas or experience in using TKM. This analysis revealed that the group with a child having experienced using TKM had a higher rate of having experienced TKM themselves, compared with the group without a child who experienced TKM (p < 0.001). Overall, the participants' satisfaction with the TKM did not show a significant difference. Also, parents of the children with experience of using TKM showed a higher level of awareness of TKM (p = 0.033). The parents pre-conceived ideas regarding TKM did not result in a statistically significant result. The group with a child who experienced using TKM (n = 198, 94.7%) had a higher number of participants who answered that they were willing to use TKM in the future, compared to children who did not experience using TKM (n = 565, 85.2%) (p = 0.003). The group with children with experience of using TKM was more willing to recommend TKM to others (p < 0.001). 3.4. Perception of the TKM Effectiveness for Diseases and Their Children's TKM Use Reported by Parents [Table 4](#healthcare-09-00385-t004)shows the analysis result on the perception of the treatment effectiveness for 16 diseases by the parents based on the children's TKM use reported by parents. The group in which the children experienced TKM in 14 out of the 16 diseases showed a higher level of perception on the treatment effect for each of the diseases. Of these, the group where the children experienced TKM for two diseases showed a perception level on the treatment effect that was higher by 10% compared to the group in which the children never experienced TKM. The said difference was statistically significant (Common cold rhinitis: p = 0.011, skin disease: p = 0.002). 4. Discussion [26](#B26-healthcare-09-00385)], and in another, 81% [ [25](#B25-healthcare-09-00385)]. However, caution should be practiced when interpreting these results as the target populations were from a daycare center within a self-governing district or the outpatients of a TKM clinic who were familiar with TKM pediatric practices. Especially, the value of 81% provided in Choi [ [25](#B25-healthcare-09-00385)] was in contrast with the result of this study, where the proportion of the children who experienced TKM was 17.4%. It is believed to be because of the bias in the selection of the participants, who were selected from the patients who used the TKM clinic of the researcher. In this study, certified national statistics were used and thus based on a representative, standard sample of Korea's general public; therefore, it is believed that the result can be generalized. Also, this study supports the findings in some preceding studies [ [25](#B25-healthcare-09-00385), [26](#B26-healthcare-09-00385)] that TKM clinics are used to treat the respiratory disease and skin disease in children. However, the said study could not cover the analysis on the purpose for the parents to use TKM clinics due to the limitations of the questions in the questionnaire, making it necessary to use caution in interpreting these findings, as it was assumed using the perception of treatment effect by parents based on the children's TKM use reported by parents. [27](#B27-healthcare-09-00385)]. Also, the demographics of these areas are heavily leaning toward the older population compared to children [ [27](#B27-healthcare-09-00385)]. [28](#B28-healthcare-09-00385)]. However, this study does not clarify the factors and correlations. Therefore, care is needed as one attempts to interpret it. Future studies are needed to investigate what is the true tendency of female and people in their 50 s or older in their use of TKM and what are the factors that contribute to such a result. Based on such findings, it would be possible to employ a more detailed approach to the use of TKM by the children. [29](#B29-healthcare-09-00385)], a time when individuals are the most active in terms of economic activities. In addition, if both parents of the children are working, it would be more likely that they would experience time or money obstacles, when trying to seek out using TKM. The findings of this study suggest that if the accessibility to TKM is improved for individuals in their 50 s, the younger parents in their 30 s to 40 s, and females, it would be possible to improve accessibility for their children. Also, in the group where the children had experienced TKM, the proportion of those with a higher level of education was higher among those who gave positive answers concerning the experience of the parents, intent to use in the future, and willingness to recommend. This can be interpreted to be because of the financial resources, desire to be healthy, and interest among these higher-education groups. However, further study is needed in order to clarify this correlation. [30](#B30-healthcare-09-00385)]. This is based on the national policy that the health care insurance coverage is to be provided for the treatments with a clear scientific basis to treat severe diseases. While CM treatments have accumulated scientific evidence all over the world, CAM treatments and traditional treatments differ between countries, making it difficult to build up scientific evidence. Therefore, it is necessary to accumulate scientific evidence for the treatment effectiveness and safety by means of exchange and harmonization of traditional medicine and CAM with international organizations such as the World Health Organization taking the leading role. If such a worldwide basis of evidence is built, it could be possible to integrate traditional medicine and CAM treatments into the healthcare coverage, eventually contributing to the improvement of the health of the public. [31](#B31-healthcare-09-00385)], which has gradually been implemented through community health centers [ [32](#B32-healthcare-09-00385)]. As such, in order for the State to maximize the effectiveness of childhood health management, mainly via TKM, a policy-based approach is needed such that the parents of these children may be provided with health management programs through TKM, as well. [5](#B5-healthcare-09-00385), [33](#B33-healthcare-09-00385)], vitamins and minerals, probiotics, yoga, qigong, meditation, tai chi, relation techniques, and hypnotherapy are rarely used in TKM clinics, and health insurance coverage of TKM treatment [ [11](#B11-healthcare-09-00385)] includes acupuncture, electro-acupuncture, pharmacopuncture, herbal medicine, chuna, cupping, and moxibustion. Therefore, it is difficult to compare the usage status and perception of TKM and CAM at the same level and generalize the results of this study. 5.
