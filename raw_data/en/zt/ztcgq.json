Students interested in learning more about the Pharm.D./Ph.D. program should contact Dr. Taifo Mahmud (taifo.mahmud@oregonstate.edu or 541-737-9679). This dual degree option would app eal primarily to students who have a passion for research and who want to spend most of their time working in research and new drug development, but who also want to have access to clinics and professional practice settings. This option requires roughly 3 and a half t o 4 years of work after completing the Pharm.D. Pharm.D./MBA Program The OSU College of Pharmacy offers a Pharm.D./MBA d egree option in collaboration with the College of Business. This degree option is available to students a fter admission to the Pharm.D. program. A separate admission process is required and acceptance t o the MBA program is not guaranteed. Students interested in learning more about the Pharm.D./MBA p rogram should contact Jeffrey Ruder (jeffrey.ruder@oregonstate.edu or 541-737-3424). Residencies and Fellowships (Advanced Patient Care Education) Although not required for licensure as a pharmacist, some students choose to pursue advanced postgraduate education, such as residencies and fellow ships. Residencies are experiences designed to provide practitioners greater confidence and skill i n direct patient care, and to provide leadership in roles such as clinical care coordinators for health car e systems. Fellowships are research focused experiences that prepare practitioners for roles in a cademia or other research based settings. 19 Experiential Education The intensity, breadth, and duration of professional experience provided at Oregon State University College of Pharmacy produces graduates who are prepa red to participate in patient care and implement innovative pharmaceutical care programs in their pe rsonal pharmacy practice. Students progress from being observers of the healthcare system to active in volvement in providing patient care in specialized settings. Early and continuing opportunities for stude nts to apply classroom knowledge in pharmacy practice settings are at the center of the profession al curriculum. Similarly, students will interact wit h students from other health professions to gain perspectiv es required to deliver healthcare in a collaborative team setting. A variety of experiences tailored to student specific interests assure that we achieve our goal of creating competent, confident, creative and caring independent pharmacy professionals. P1 Year Fall Term: Introductory Pharmacy Practice 1. Introduction to c ertifications, skills and attitudes expected of pharmacy professionals. Students will develop the n ecessary knowledge in the areas of professionalism, teamwork and required legal preparat ion for experiential education. Both general and specific concepts of jurisprudence and bioethics relati ng to the practice of pharmacy will be covered. Preparation to participate in experiential educatio n including: Board of Pharmacy Intern regulations, C V preparation, interviewing skills, HIPAA, etc. Winter and Spring Terms: Legal and ethical concepts relating to pharmacy prac tice presented in fall term will be built upon in subsequent terms. Over the course of the year, students will have the op portunity to rotate through a variety of practice settings. Each student will be assigned to a community pharmacy for half of the year (Community Pharmacy Orientation Clerkship), while the other hal f of the year will be spent in various health care settings. Sites are located between Eugene and Salem. If students are commuting, it may be possible to make arrangements for student assignments in their city of residence. Transportation is the responsibility of the student. Goals: By the completion of the P1 year, students will be p repared for experiential training in pharmacy settings and have the tools to effectively interview f or a summer internship. An understanding of the unique role that pharmacists play in the health care team is developed during the lab portion of the course and discussed in depth in the classroom. Students will have the opportunity to participate in immunization clinics, in addition to patient outreac h events in the local community. All required paperwork and site visit reports become part of the student's experiential portfolio. Total Experiential Hours: 71 hours 20 P2 Year Fall, Winter, and Spring Terms: Introductory Pharmacy Practice 2. Students will be a ssigned to assist in the ongoing provision of patient care at sites throug hout the Willamette Valley, with specific focus on patient counseling in the community pharmacy setting and ambulatory care pharmacy. Assignments are made by the experiential education office. If stude nts are commuting, it may be possible to make arrangements for student assignments in their city of r esidence. Transportation is the responsibility of the student. Goals: Students develop an understanding of the impact of health challenges and treatment options on the lives of patients. Students gain a longitudinal p erspective on disease management and the difficulties encountered within our healthcare system . Empathy, cultural awareness and patient advocacy evolve as a consequence of one-on-one intera ctions with patients. Total Experiential Hours: 61 hours P1 and P2 Years Summer Terms: Institutional Pharmacy Orientation Clerkship. Studen ts complete an orientation clerkship in Hospital Pharmacy lasting 80 hours. Assign ments to pharmacy sites are made in collaboration with, and must be approved by, the exp eriential education office. Goals: By the beginning of the P3 year the student will h ave mastered an understanding of drug distribution in Community and Hospital settings. They will be comfortable in interactions with patients, colleagues and other health professionals. Students ar e familiar with basic regulatory constraints for each setting and are able to participate as a team m ember in the delivery of foundational aspects of patient care. Documentation of competencies achieved and self-reflective exercises are included in the student's portfolio. Total Experiential hours: 80 hours 21 P3 Year Fall, Winter and Spring Terms: Introductory Pharmacy Practice 3. Students are assig ned to community and hospital pharmacy sites for the entire year. The sites are located throughout the Willamette Valley and transportation is the responsibility of each studen t. Goals: The goal is to provide students with an opportunity to integrate knowledge, skills, and attitude into practice while enhancing patient and interprof essional communication skills through consultation and interviewing diverse array of patients. By the e nd of this experience, students will become proficient in providing patient consultations, providing extensi ve evidence base information regarding medication selection, administration, and monitoring. In additio n, students will become proficient in obtaining and documenting accurate medication history information, communicating with other health care professionals, and selecting and executing appropriate pharmaceutical care plan. Core activities include but not limited to the following: preparing pharma ceuticals, patient interview and consultations, medication therapy management, medication reconcili ation, physical assessment, administration of immunizations, interprofessional team communication, patient monitoring, and participation community outreach events. A summary of competencies m astered as well as a copy of the case presentation and patient care project will be includ ed in the student's portfolio. Total Experiential hours: 120 hours P4 Year Summer/Fall/Winter/Spring Terms: Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience. The P4 yea r begins almost immediately after the completion of the P3 ye ar. Each student will complete seven different rotations of six weeks each, 40 hours per week. Studen ts are assigned one six-week period during the year to take as their \"off block.\" One rotation must take place in a rural setting or with an underserved population that has limited access to health care serv ices. 4 Required Rotations: 1. General Adult Medicine 2. Hospital / Health Systems 3. Community 4. Ambulatory care 3 Electives: Student can choose from among a large variety of pat ient and non-patient care rotations. At least one elective must be in a patient care setting. Students return to campus each term for seminars geared towards pharmacists in training preparing to enter the work force. 22 Goals/Outcomes: Build upon the didactic lectures and introductory e xperiential training the student has experienced in the P1 through P3 years. By the time the student completes their fourth year they are prepared to enter any pharmacy practice setting to deliver optimal and evidence based patient focused care to a wide variety of patient population. Stud ents maintain a copy of the project and presentation they complete at each rotation in their portfolio. Continuing self-assessment and self-improvement are important aspects of the educational process throughou t the P4 year. Total Experiential hours = 1680 hours In Summary: Introductory Pharmacy Practice Education = 320 hour s Advanced Pharmacy Practice Education = 1680 hours Total = 2000 hours Students are eligible for intern licensure upon ente ring the Pharm.D program, at the start of the P1 year. As a P1, students will have the opportunity to function as an \"academic intern,\" but are not elig ible to work in a paid internship position. Upon successful completion of the P1 year, students are able to apply and work as a paid intern. The College will be responsible for counting intern ship hours throughout the Pharm.D program. Upon successful completion of the program, the College wil l notify the Oregon Board of Pharmacy that a student is now eligible to sit for the NAPLEX and MPJ E exams. If a student has plans to practice in another state, h e/she must comply with the Board of Pharmacy rules for that state. 23 Section 3: Academic and Professional Standards Introduction Welcome to the pharmacy profession and a life-long le arning process. There is no question that in your career you will make a difference in the lives you touch. Patients, colleagues and the public in general place a high degree of trust in the expertise of ph armacy professionals. Pharmacists commit to fulfill that trust by maintaining intellectual and behaviora l competencies required to excel in their chosen profession. The Oregon State University College of Pharmacy is co mmitted to providing students, staff and faculty a welcoming environment in which to learn and work. W e promote community that is founded on collegiality, mutual trust, and respect. The College has a similar commitment to the public in assuring that professional students and, upon graduation, pharm acists have the essential attributes and abilities required to provide quality patient-centered care t o a diverse population. The Oregon State University Student Conduct Regulati ons define several expectations of students. The College of Pharmacy professional program has defined additional academic and behavioral expectations and characteristics considered essential to being a stu dent pharmacist and pharmacist. Individuals who choose to become student pharmacists do so with the und erstanding that admission, progression and graduation are dependent upon their capacity to per sonally demonstrate essential characteristics defined by the College and profession of pharmacy. Academic and Professional Standards for students enroll ed in the Oregon State University Pharm.D. program are outlined on the following pages. You mus t follow these standards whether at OSU in Corvallis, OHSU in Portland, or at a clinical site o n a rotation. Academic policies, policies that provi de for student and patient safety, and other requirements of the professional program are detailed. Also included are specifics of how policies are implemented , consequences of failing to meet standards, and appeal procedures. Every attempt has been made to be comprehensive, but every situation may not be specifically addressed. The College of Pharmacy Academ ic and Professional Standards committee has the responsibility to implement and interpret academ ic and professional policies and to determine how to respond to situations not specifically addressed. 24 Essential Characteristics of Student Pharmacists The Essential Characteristics of Student Pharmacists ( \"Essential Characteristics\") identified below are drawn from a number of different resources that gover n the professional expectations of pharmacists, including but not limited to the national Pharmacy Code of Ethics, the Oath of a Pharmacist, and the Pledge of Professionalism. The Essential Characteristi cs are intended to ensure that student pharmacists and pharmacists educated at the College of Pharmacy have the capacity to meet federal and state regulations and policies that pertain to pharmacy, an d to meet or exceed expectations that the public has for professional competence and behavior among ph armacy professionals. Academic and professional environments present differ ent challenges, but the Essential Characteristics required to succeed in pharmacy are common to both se ttings. Students in the College must observe and fulfill the Essential Characteristics, which have been divided into the following relevant categories: Intellectual Ability, Empathetic and Collegial Comm unication Skills, Psychomotor Skills, Respect for Diversity, High Ethical Standards, and Behavioral an d Social Expectations. Under each category are examples that describe and cl arify these Essential Characteristics. Intellectual Ability Comprehend, interpret and analyze new information Reason and carry out evidence-based decision making Use critical thinking skills and problem solving to e valuate information from multiple sources and synthesize a plan of action Thrive in a rigorous foundational and clinical scienc e-based curriculum Participate in self- and programmatic-assessment inte nded to sustain a continual improvement process Be curious and pursue life-long learning Empathetic and Collegial Communication Skills Formulate concise, accurate synopses of essential info rmation Contribute in a meaningful and collaborative manner in group discussions Interact constructively with other members of a healt h care team Communicate difficult concepts orally and in writing at an appropriate level for specific patients or audiences Listen empathetically and develop rapport Appropriately display, and interpret, non-verbal com munication signals Communicate fluently in English Effectively utilize resources to communicate in non- English languages 25 Psychomotor Skills* Participate effectively in preparation and distribu tion of sterile and non-sterile drug products Utilize and analyze information from varied sensory i nputs Participate in drug administration, including injec tions Carry out tasks required for objective and subjective assessment of patient health Discern critical elements of a problem through observa tion Respect for Diversity Communicate in a manner that respects all individual s Proactively seek ways to provide an inclusive envir onment that addresses unique patient needs Provide care without judgment of a patients' personal choices or situation Individualize care with consideration of cultural no rms for the patient Individualize care with consideration of unique ther apeutic needs or challenges High Ethical Standards Maintain confidentiality Act with compassion, empathy and altruism Accept responsibility and provide leadership Abstain from illicit drug use Act with integrity and expect the same of professiona l colleagues Behavioral and Social Expectations Demonstrate a history of appropriate behavior in pers onal actions Perform effectively and display sound judgment while under stress Perform appropriately in academic or professional se ttings Address disagreements with tact and avoid public alterc ations Exhibit the capacity to adapt to change readily and adjust responses in dynamic, unpredictable situations Accept constructive criticism and adapt behavior *Students may be able to be admitted and progress to graduation while not possessing selected psychomotor skills. In the instance of a documented di sability, the College will work to provide reasonable accommodation. The absence of some skills, h owever, may limit the variety of settings in which a pharmacist can work. 26 Requirements for Progression Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) students must meet uni versity requirements and standards and adhere to the university Student Conduct Regulations ( http://oregonstate.edu/admin/stucon ). The College of Pharmacy has adopted additional requirements to assure that all pharmacy graduates have the best possible educational background and preparation for their pharmacy practice careers. College of Pharmacy standards may vary from or exceed the univer sity standards in order to ensure compliance with policies, regulations and expectations specific to the pharmacy profession. Students are expected to meet specific academic and p rofessional requirements to matriculate in the College of Pharmacy and to progress to each successive year of the professional program. Each student's standing is reviewed at the end of every term, or at any time in the interim 'for cause'. The review includes core pharmacy term GPA, cumulative GPA, and other characteristics identified as being essential to student pharmacists and pharmacists. The professional Pharm. D. degree program at Oregon State University is designed to be completed within four years. The program combines didactic cour ses, structured clinical practice opportunities, and, optimally, significant work experience to educ ate pharmacists that have both in-depth and up-to- date knowledge to be change agents in their chosen p rofession.

To graduate with the Pharm.D. degree, students: Must have met all requirements defined for progressio n through the first, second, third, and fourth professional years Must successfully complete all required and elective ro tations with a passing grade Must fulfill the Essential Characteristics of Student Pharmacists identified by the College. 28 Academic and Professional Policies University Requirements and College Requirements Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) students must meet uni versity requirements and standards and adhere to the university Student Conduct Regulations ( http://oregonstate.edu/admin/stucon ). The College of Pharmacy has adopted additional requirements to assure that all pharmacy graduates have the best possible educational background and preparation for their pharmacy practice careers. College of Pharmacy standards may vary from or exceed the univer sity standards in order to ensure compliance with policies, regulations and expectations specific to the pharmacy profession. Disability Access Services The College of Pharmacy will provide reasonable and appropriate accommodations to students with qualifying disabilities to maximize their opportuniti es for success. If a student suspects a disability may be limiting his or her performance, he or she is respo nsible for contacting Disability Access Services (DAS) as soon as possible, at 541-737-4098. The University will determine whether accommodation s can be offered based on a number of factors, including whether a student has a qualifying disabilit y and whether the requested accommodations would effect a fundamental alteration of the pharma cy program. DAS will work with the student to determine whether the student has a qualifying disabil ity to scope potential accommodations. The College will determine, through the Academic and Pr ofessional Standards Committee, whether any requested accommodations will effect a fundamental al teration of the program. Students with accommodations approved through DAS are responsible fo r contacting the faculty member in charge of the course prior to or during the first week of the t erm to discuss implementation of approved accommodations. To request accommodations, students must follow the proc edures described at http://ds.oregonstate.edu/prospective/ , which include registering online, providing approp riate documentation, completing a DAS orientation, and ma king requests for accommodations each term. Students with disabilities are offered many different types of auxiliary aids to ensure access and accommodation to education. These auxiliary service s and aids include (but are not limited to): accessible formats, alternate testing, note-taking serv ices, interpreting services, and tape texts. Students must submit requests for auxiliary aids each te rm. If a request is submitted after the relevant deadline, DAS will make every reasonable effort to a ccommodate the request but cannot guarantee that such a request can be met. Untimely requests may resul t in delay, substitutions, or denial of accommodation Bachelor's Degree Requirement Pharm.D. students must complete a bachelor's degree bef ore the beginning of their third professional year. Any student not completing the bachelor's degre e prior to their third professional year will be placed on Suspension and will not be allowed to conti nue until the bachelor's degree is complete. A 29 printed official transcript verifying completion of the degree requirement must be submitted directly to the Director of Student Services/Head Advisor. Prerequisites Students may register for only those courses for which t hey have completed the stated prerequisite courses. Exceptions are allowed only with approval of the College of Pharmacy Academic and Professional Standards Committee. Students are responsi ble for verifying that they have completed all prerequisites. They must not enroll in any course for which they lack a prerequisite. If enrolled in such a course by mistake, they must immediately drop it. Enro llment in a course for which a student lacks a required prerequisite will result in an automatic fa iling grade for that course. Incompletes Incompletes (I grades) in core professional pharmacy courses must be removed within three weeks after the date that marks the beginning of the next term o r advanced clerkship. Failure to remove an Incomplete within three weeks will result in a faili ng grade for the class, unless the student has petitioned and been granted an extension by the Col lege of Pharmacy Academic and Professional Standards Committee, and the student will be placed o n Suspension. Repeating Core Pharmacy Courses A student may re-enroll in a pharmacy course or clerk ship one time for the purpose of earning a grade above C- or earning a P in a P/N course. If the stude nt receives a grade below C- or N the second time they take a course or clerkship, he or she will be pl aced on Suspension and may be dismissed from the professional program. Students who fail a required advanced clerkship (PHA R 780, 785, 790, or 792) will not be allowed to continue in previously scheduled clerkships. The stude nt must reschedule and successfully complete an equivalent advanced clerkship experience that will fulfill the requirements of the failed clerkship, pr ior to continuing in the advanced experiential program. The College of Pharmacy Academic and Professional Standards Committee, the Director of Student Service s, and the Director of Experiential Programs will work with the student to explore possibilities for rem ediation, if appropriate, before the student reenrolls in the clerkship experience. Leave of Absence The Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) program is a four -year program. Students may take up to five years to complete the program with approval from the Coll ege of Pharmacy Academic and Professional Standards Committee. Any student wishing to use the fif th-year option (sometimes called \"flexing\") must first petition the College of Pharmacy Academic and Professional Standards Committee for approval. Students should contact the Director of Stu dent Services/Head Advisor for specific instructions regarding the petition. Academic Integrity The College of Pharmacy does not tolerate academic d ishonesty. Similarly, students must not tolerate dishonesty in the behavior of their colleagues. Stude nts that engage in academic dishonesty may face Dismissal from the Pharm.D. Program on the first offen se. 30 Academic dishonesty includes but is not limited to falsi fying or cheating on an examination, plagiarism resulting from incomplete citations of source material , and other unprofessional behavior as described in College and University policies. For situations that involve group work, faculty membe rs have a responsibility to clearly define which assignments permit group work and which do not. The C ollege expects all Pharmacy students to give appropriate credit to others whose ideas are cited. St udents must actively participate and accept responsibility in group assignments when all members of the group receive the same grade. For work turned in for individual credit, the student must ha ve independently completed the work and accept personal responsibility for all work submitted. Definitions and examples of Academic Dishonesty are fou nd on the OSU website under the Office of Student Conduct ( http://oregonstate.edu/admin/stucon/achon.htm ). If there is any question as to what constitutes plagiarism or other forms of academic disho nesty, students should actively seek clarification from the instructor. Examination Policies Students are expected to conduct themselves during ex aminations in a manner that will not be disruptive to other students. If health or personal sit uations may require a student to disrupt the class (e.g. if a phone must be left on to be available for a sick child), the student should notify the instruct or prior to the exam. Personal needs (restroom, eating) should be addressed pr ior to the exam period. All electronic devices must be turned off and put awa y. Coats, hats and other 'outerwear' should be removed. Students should raise their hand to attract an instruct or's attention during an examination, rather than coming to the front of the room. Upon completion of an examination, students should not engage the instructor in conversation and should refrain from discussing the examination whi le in earshot of the classroom where the examination is being administered. Instructors will be available whenever possible during examinations. Students are expected to avoid behavior that might c ause an instructor to be concerned about academic dishonesty. Only approved electronic devices (e.g. approved calc ulators) are permitted. Phones, entertainment electronics, and computers must be off and not visible to the student or instructor. All papers must be inside a folder or backpack and pu t away. Students should keep test papers and scoring sheets cover ed when they are not being used. If a student receives approval to take an examination at a time other than the originally scheduled time, the student will be asked to sign a st atement verifying that they have not 31 received information related to the examination fro m other students and will not discuss the examination with students that have not yet complete d the examination. Students are encouraged to bring any perceived error s on tests or assignment documents to the attention of the instructor or proctor. Clarificatio ns, if deemed necessary by the instructor, will be posted on the classroom board and students' attention will be directed to the board. Class Schedule and Required Assignment Policies Class, recitation, lab and exam schedules are establ ished early in each term. Non-emergency personal plans should not conflict with scheduled examinations or required assignments. Parents should make arrangements for child care on sc heduled no-school days for their children who regularly attend school. When making personal plans, students should assume that it may be necessary for them to be available until the end of finals week. Students will not be admitted to examinations if they arrive after a student has already completed the examination. Generally, no additional time will be allowed if a student arrives late for an examination . The instructor does have discretion to allow addition al time, if there are extenuating circumstances. If at all possible, students are required to contact instructors prior to any examination, or assignment due date, if they will be unable to attend the exam ination or submit the assignment when scheduled. The remedy for excused absences is at the discretion of the course coordinator and is published in individual course documents. Documentation of the rea son for excused absences may be required. Unexcused absences from examinations will result in a f ailing grade. Student Guidelines Regarding Course Materials To protect privacy rights, intellectual property rig hts, and the quality of the teaching and learning experience, the College of Pharmacy has adopted the following policies and guidelines governing course materials. Course materials include presentation mate rials created by instructors or other students, materials distributed in support of class activities, co urse assessments, and audio or video recordings. Except as provided below, students shall not give, sell , publish, or otherwise distribute any materials, in any medium, of any course given at the OSU College of Pharmacy, without the written consent of the course instructor and the Dean of the College of Pharmacy. Students currently enrolled in a course may, with the prior permission of the course instructor or guest lecturer, make audio or video recordings of course content, for use in study or other noncommercial purposes. If students intend to record photographs, video, or audio that includes other students, they must also obtain prior per mission from the included students. Students currently enrolled in a course may distribute recordings to other currently enrolled OSU College of Pharmacy students for use in study or o ther noncommercial purposes arising from participation in the course, but they must ensure that recordings are distributed only in 32 private forums. Any online distribution or posting of such recordings must be made on a password-protected site, such as the student Wiki. If granted permission to use recordings or content fr om faculty or student presentations (e.g. slides, figures, charts) in their own presentations, p apers, or other scholarly activities, students must cite the source of those recordings or content app ropriately. Students should exercise special caution when creating or distributing audio, video, or image recordings of patients. Students must not create or d istribute recordings of patients without securing the permission of everyone identifiable in the recording and their course instructor or preceptor. 33 Experiential Education Policies All pharmacy students have additional responsibilities t o themselves, the College, their preceptor, and the profession to maintain the highest professional st andards while in professional practice settings. These professional standards, or experiential program guidelines, are identified in experiential program manuals that will be made available to pharmacy stud ents. Pharmacy students that fail to adhere to experiential program guidelines are subject to discip linary action and removal from the practice site, which may delay or prevent graduation from the prof essional program. Several guidelines are emphasized below, but experiential program manuals sh ould be consulted for a complete description of expectations. 1. Students must be licensed as a pharmacy intern with th e Oregon State Board of Pharmacy, as well as any state in which they will complete a cle rkship experience. 2. Students must exhibit professional appearance in both manner and dress as specified by the preceptor. If appropriate, students must wear a name tag or ID badge approved by the College and identifying them as an OSU/OHSU student. Students may not use nametags from places of employment while completing clerkship experiences. 3. Students are obligated to protect patient confidenti ality and respect all confidences. 4. Students are expected to display active participation and initiative in seeking learning opportunities. 5. Students are expected to display respect and courtesy t o the preceptor. Disagreements should be addressed in private as part of an overall learnin g process. 6. Students must be punctual. Changes in previously appro ved schedules must be communicated to and approved by the preceptor. 7. Students are encouraged to communicate with healthca re professionals and patients. Communications that involve professional judgment sho uld be discussed with the preceptor prior to implementation. 8. Students must be familiar with and observe all laws an d regulations governing the practice of pharmacy and should seek clarification from the prec eptor when necessary. 9. Students must fulfill the Essential Characteristics of Ph armacy Students identified by the College. 34 Student and Patient Safety Policies Disclosure of Criminal Activity Pharm.D. students must immediately disclose any crimina l activity, alleged criminal activity, arrests, or other encounters with law enforcement that occur whi le enrolled in the Pharm.D. program to a faculty mentor or member of the Office of Student Services. Failure to do so could result in Dismissal from the Pharm.D. program. Disclosure of Board of Pharmacy Action Pharm.D. students must also immediately disclose any act ion taken against them by a Board of Pharmacy, including but not limited to warning, pro bation, and revocation of licensure. Failure to do so could result in Dismissal from the Pharm.D. Program. Criminal Background Check and Drug Screening Pharmacists are entrusted with the health, safety, and welfare of patients, access controlled substances and confidential information, and operate in settin gs that require the exercise of good judgment and ethical behavior. Accordingly, the College of Pharm acy requires all pharmacy students to complete Criminal Background Checks and recommends that all ph armacy students submit to Drug Screening. Criminal Background Checks and Drug Screening have b ecome standard requirements for employment in pharmacy and placement in clinical rotations and early experiential rotations. Criminal Background Checks and Drug Screening may also be required for li censure. Students who cannot participate in clinical rotations and early experiential rotations d ue to criminal or other activities of concern that a re revealed in Criminal Background Checks or Drug Scree ning may be unable to fulfill the requirements of their College program. Therefore, it is in everyone' s interest to conduct Criminal Background Checks and Drug Screening early to resolve any issues prior to co mmitment of resources by the College and by students. The following College policies regarding Cr iminal Background Checks and Drug Screening were developed in accordance with national standards and t he November 2006 Report of the AACP Criminal Background Check Advisory Panel. Purpose The purposes of criminal background checks and drug scr eenings include: To enhance the safety and well-being of patients, To ascertain the ability of accepted applicants and enrolled pharmacy students to eventually become a licensed pharmacist, and To bolster the public's continuing trust in the pharma cy profession, Application The policies regarding Criminal Background Checks an d Drug Screening apply to all applicants accepted into the Doctor of Pharmacy program. Accepted appli cants must submit to the Criminal Background Checks, regardless of any previous criminal background checks that may have been conducted for the applicants. Criminal Background Checks and Drug Scre enings are only completed on accepted 35 applicants, and, therefore, the results are not a fact or in the initial admission decision process. The College, however, may rescind an initial offer of ad mission should the results of either the Criminal Background Check or a Drug Screening show that the s tudent has engaged in behaviors that are not consistent with the Essential Characteristics of Studen t Pharmacists or are otherwise indicative of an inability to fulfill the requirements of the College program for which they were admitted. Decisions to rescind admission are made on a case-by-case basis aft er a formal committee review by the College of Pharmacy Academic and Professional Standards Committee (\"APSC\"). The APSC will communicate its decision and the reason or reasons for its decision to the affected student. Accepted applicants whose offer of admission is rescinded based on the results of the Criminal Background Check or a Drug Screening may appeal the decision through the standa rd College of Pharmacy appeals process. Background Check The College of Pharmacy requires that students submit to a Criminal Background Check using a vendor designated and approved by the College. Criminal Bac kground Checks typically involve access to court records containing local, state, or federal incident s of arraignment, trial, and disposition; law enforcement agency records containing incidents of co mplaint, investigation, arrest, and indictment; and, correction agency records containing informatio n about probation, parole, and incarceration. In addition, a sex offender registry check and Departme nt of Motor Vehicle driving history check will be completed. Frequency: All persons accepted to the professional program must su bmit to a Criminal Background Check prior to matriculation. The College may require students to sub mit to a Criminal Background Check again prior to advancing into the third professional year, which tak es place on the Oregon Health and Sciences University campus. While unusual, it is possible that specific clerkship sites or practice settings will require that students submit to additional Criminal B ackground Checks. Procedure: Students will be contacted directly by the College-a pproved vendor for background checks. It is important that students carefully follow directions pr ovided. Results of background checks are sent directly to the College. Results are stored separatel y from the student's academic file. Committee Review Standards: The APSC will review all Criminal Background Checks . The College may rescind an offer of admission, dismiss a student, or place a student on Warning, Prob ation, or Suspension, based on information revealed in the results of the Criminal Background C hecks. The College may refer students to the Oregon Pharmacy Recovery Network, a non-profit organizatio n that counsels pharmacists regarding chemical dependency, if a background check reveals recent cri minal offenses related to alcohol or drugs. 36 OHSU, individual experiential sites, and the Oregon State Board of Pharmacy will make independent decisions about the results of a student's Criminal Back ground Check. If OHSU refuses to allow a student on campus due to the results of a Criminal Background Check or the Oregon Board of Pharmacy refuses to issue an intern license, the student will not be ab le to complete the professional program, resulting i n dismissal from the professional program. Similarly, if an individual experiential site refuses to accept a student, progression will likely be delayed and it ma y not be possible for the student to complete the professional program. If the College is unable to fin d alternative experiential sites the student may, therefore, be dismissed from the College for failure t o make reasonable progress in the pharmacy program. Confidentiality/Record Keeping: All records related to background checks are stored se parately from academic files. Only members of the APSC and faculty associated with experiential edu cation have access to Criminal Background Check results. College Disclaimer: The Criminal Background Check process does not guara ntee the safety of students, patients, faculty, or staff. An acceptable criminal background check, as de fined by the College, does not guarantee the student will be eligible to complete the program or obtain a license to practice pharmacy upon graduation. OHSU, experiential sites or the Oregon State Board of Pharmacy may apply different standards or uncover new information not revealed in previous record searches. Payment Process: All expenses associated with a Background Check are the responsibility of the student or applicant. Refusing Background Check: A student will not be allowed to matriculate in or c ontinue in the Pharm.D. program if: He or she does not consent to required Criminal Backgr ound Checks, He or she has an unsatisfactory history revealed by th e results of a Criminal Background Check, He or she does not meet the eligibility requirements for Oregon Intern Licensure. 37 Drug Screening The College strongly encourages students to submit to a Drug Screening prior to matriculation. The test provided by the College's designated vendor will, at a minimum, screen for Amphetamines, Metabolites, Marijuana Metabolites, Opiate Metabolite s, and Phencyclidine (PCP). It may also screen for additional illegal drugs or controlled substances. Frequency: All professional students should participate in a Drug Screening prior to beginning the Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) program. Additional future screening may be required \"for ca use\" upon the College's reasonable suspicion that a student is en gaged in the misuse of drugs or use of illegal drug s at any time during the professional program. Specific clerkship sites or practice settings may also require additional Drug Screenings. If a faculty member, preceptor or colleague believe s there is sufficient cause for Drug Screening, the request with rationale will be submitted to the APSC. The APSC will make all decisions regarding whether to administer a mandatory Drug Screening fo r cause upon reasonable suspicion that a student is engaged in the misuse of drugs or use of illegal drug s. The decision of the committee is final. The College will pay for the first \"for cause\" Drug Scre ening. Failure to comply with an APSC request to undergo Drug Screening for cause will be grounds for Suspension and, potentially, Dismissal. Procedure: Students who agree to submit to the Drug Screening wi ll be contacted directly by the College-approved vendor for Drug Screenings. It is important that stud ents carefully follow directions provided. Results of Drug Screenings are sent directly to the College. Re sults are stored separately from the student's academic file. Committee Review Standards: If a student fails an initial Drug Screening, the med ical director of the testing center will contact th e student to discuss issues that might have resulted in a f ailed Drug Screening. The student may be cleared at that point or referred to take a second D rug Screening. The school is not notified unless the results of a second Drug Screening are positive, in wh ich case the results will be forwarded to the College and referred to the APSC. If the College of Pharmacy is notified of a positive Drug Screening prior to matriculation, the student' s offer of admission will be rescinded and the student w ill not be allowed to begin the Pharm.D. program. Current students with an unsatisfactory Drug Screening will be referred to the Oregon State Board of Pharmacy and the APSC. The APSC will determine the student's standing in the College. Additionally, they will be referred to the Oregon Pharmacy Recove ry Network, a non-profit organization that counsels pharmacists regarding chemical dependency. Confidentiality/Record Keeping: 38 All records related to Drug Screening results are stor ed separately from the student's academic file. Only members of the APSC and faculty associated with expe riential education have access to the drug screening results. College Disclaimer: The Drug Screening process does not guarantee the safe ty of students, patients, faculty, or staff. Payment Process: All expenses associated with a Drug Screening are the r esponsibility of the student or applicant. Refusing Drug Screening: Drug screening is required by many practice settings in which students are placed for Introductory, Transitional and Advanced clerkships. It is likely tha t the College will be unable to identify adequate s ites with the required diversity of experiences for stude nts who refuse drug screening. A student who refuses an initial drug screening will be dismissed at any time during his or her progression if appropriate clerkship sites, that do not require drug screening, are not available during the standard clerkship placement process. Students that agree to drug screening at a time after the first two weeks of the P1 year will likely be significant ly delayed in their professional program. APSC determines whether a student should undergo a dru g screening 'for cause' based on a demonstrated failure of the student to meet the Essent ial Characteristics of a Pharmacist that the APSC reasonably believes may be tied to substance abuse. A st udent who refuses drug screening 'for cause' will face Suspension and then considered for Dismissal from the Pharm.D. Program. Experiential Site Requirements Specific Experiential Sites may require students to co mplete background checks, drug testing, immunizations, or other requirements on a more frequ ent time frame than required by the College. Students are responsible for the cost associated with th ese requirements and should check with Experiential Directors about additional requirements when selecting experiential sites. Confidentiality, Diversity, and Harassment Training All pharmacy students receive training on issues relatin g to confidentiality (including Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act training), diver sity, and harassment. These training sessions assure that student, staff, faculty and patient information is handled appropriately and that students, staff, faculty and patients find an environment that is welc oming and respectful. Training sessions offered by the College occur early in the first professional yea r and again before pharmacy students move to the OHSU campus, and they are mandatory. Individual expe riential sites may have additional training requirements. 39 Identification Pharm.D. students are required to wear a nametag whil e representing the College at any experiential site or event. The nametag must be approved by the Co llege and identify them as an OSU/OHSU student. Students may not use nametags from places of e mployment while completing clerkship experiences. Immunizations All Pharm.D. Each student must have complete immunization records on file with Student Health Services by the start of their first professional year; and students must hav e had, at least, the first in the series of three Hepatitis B vaccinations by the end of October of the ir first professional year. If immunization records are not complete or the Hepatitis B series has not be en started by that time, registration for winter term classes will be blocked and the student will be placed on Suspension. The complete Hepatitis B series must be completed by the end of the first professiona l year. A Hepatitis B Surface Antibody blood titer is required by the end of the second professional year. Annual TB screening is required of all pharmacy stude nts. Students should review the categories outlined on the TB Annual Monitoring Form provided by the College and follow procedures appropriate for their category. Individuals with a history of BCG vaccination ARE NOT exempt from this requirement. P3 students are required to meet OHSU's immunization st andards. Specific clerkship sites or practice settings may also have site specific immunization stand ards. Information regarding OHSU's immunization requirements can be found at http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/student- services/joseph-trainer-health-wellness-center/student -requirements/index.cfm . This immunization policy is necessary to protect the h ealth of students and patients. Therefore, students who do not maintain current immunizations or complet e an annual TB screening may have holds placed on their registration or be referred to the Academic and Professional Standards Committee. Blood-Borne Pathogen Training Blood Borne Pathogen training assures safety for healt hcare professionals and patients in situations where body fluids may be present. Mandatory training sessions are held at several points in the professional curriculum. Additional training may be r equired by specific experiential sites. CPR and First Aid Certification Students must have a current First Aid Certification and Adult CPR certification at the time of matriculation to the College of Pharmacy. Adult CPR certification that includes training on an Automati c External Defibrillator (AED) is recommended. Altern ative certification may be substituted, but must be approved by the Director of Student Services/Head Ad visor. Online certification, or recertification, for CPR or First Aid is NOT accepted. 40 CPR certification must be current while enrolled in the College of Pharmacy. Newly admitted students may not begin the program if proof of current CPR a nd First Aid certification is not provided prior to the first day of fall term classes. If a student's CPR certi fication lapses, a registration hold will be placed fo r the following term and the student may not progress un til proof of current certification has been received by the Director of Student Services/Head A dvisor. Immunization Certification Successful completion of the Immunization Certificate Program is required of all professional students prior to beginning the second professional year. Stude nts will be provided one copy of the immunization certification certificate. A fee will be charged fo r each additional copy requested. Bodily Fluid Exposure and Needle Stick Policy Post-Exposure Procedures Student pharmacists experiencing a body fluid exposure should immediately cleanse the wound or mucous membrane with soap and water, or if contact is to the eye(s), flush with water for several minutes. Exposure involving a known HIV positive sour ce should be considered a medical emergency and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) should be initiate d within 2 hours of exposure per CDC recommendations. The exposure should be reported immediately to the ap propriate personnel at the site and at the College of Pharmacy. The student pharmacist should im mediately contact the Director of Experiential Programs and seek care for necessary medical testing and evaluation for post-exposure prophylaxis. Advanced Pharmacy Practice Education (APPE) If the exposure occurred at an APPE site, the studen t should immediately notify the preceptor and the Director of Experiential Programs. The student shoul d seek immediate medical evaluation and care with employee health at the site or, if directed, with t he nearest urgent care/emergency department, health care facility or personal physician of choice. The p receptor should provide guidance to the student regarding the procedure to follow regarding post-exp osure medical care and the student should comply with the preceptor's instructions. The Director of Exp eriential Programs and the Director of Student Services should be notified as soon as possible regarding the incident. The individual who is the source of any potential b lood borne pathogen should be informed of the exposure by the preceptor or the Director of Experie ntial Programs, not by the student. The preceptor or Director of Experiential Programs should arrange for consent to be obtained from the source for the appropriate medical testing. Introductory Pharmacy Practice Education (IPPE) If the exposure occurred during a patient visit for IPPE, the student should immediately notify the Director of the IPPE Program, the Director of Exper iential Learning and the Director of Student Servic es. The student pharmacist should seek immediate medical ev aluation and care. The source should be informed of the exposure by the Director of the IPPE Program or the Director of Experiential Programs. 41 Other College of Pharmacy Sponsored Events If the exposure occurred during a College of Pharmac y sponsored event other than IPPE or APPE, the student should immediately notify the faculty advisor or the preceptor involved in the event, the Director of Experiential Programs, and the Director of Student Services. The student should seek immediate medical evaluation and care. The source sho uld be informed of the exposure by the faculty advisor or preceptor, not the student. Laboratory Testing Laboratory testing should be conducted for HIV, Hepat itis B and Hepatitis C based on current guidelines and available source patient data. Laboratory testing should be conducted immediately after the exposure. Additional testing may be required over the next few weeks or months. Results of laboratory testing should be reported directly to the student. Costs of Treatment APPE and IPPE sites are under no obligation to prov ide medical evaluation or treatment if needed. Some APPE sites will treat the student as they do employees but sites are under no obligation to do this. Students should learn the policies and procedures to fo llow at each site by discussing them with their preceptors. In all cases, the cost of treatment is the responsibility of the student. The College of Pharmacy does not provide reimbursement for costs related to exposure. St udents are required to have health insurance and are expected to use their insurance to cover costs of treatment. Reporting Form Students should make reports using the Incident Report Form in the appendices. 42 Other Policies and Requirements Email All pharmacy students are required to activate and us e their ONID e-mail account. Official correspondence from the University (including the Col lege of Pharmacy) will be sent to the ONID e-mail account. Students are responsible for information sent to their ONID account. Forwarding ONID emails to another email account is not recommended. Failur e to receive e-mail because your alternative email account is no longer valid or for any other reason re lated to use of an alternative email account will no t be an acceptable excuse for missing information or a ssignments communicated from the College or University. Third year pharmacy students will be assigned an OHSU email account. Third and fourth year pharmacy students are required to check both their ONID email accounts and their OHSU email accounts and will be held responsible for any information sent to eithe r e-mail account. Dress Code Students enrolled in a professional program are expec ted to dress in an appropriate manner. Typically, classroom and laboratory settings are informal, but st udents should adapt their dress to that which is commonly observed on the specific campus at which the y are attending classes. Business casual attire is commonly expected in practice settings or in educati onal settings where patients are present. Guidance from preceptors or instructors regarding site or campu s specific expectations should be respected. In all settings, students should be well groomed and u se good judgment as to what constitutes attire that is 'too casual' for a professional program. Stude nts who wear attire that is unprofessional may be asked to leave the site or classroom. Students with re peated violations will be referred to the Academic and Professional Standards Committee. Professional Student Orientation Program Professional student orientation programs are held pri or to the beginning of each professional year. Attendance is required and students are responsible for all information presented. If a student cannot attend an orientation, they must contact the Directo r of Student Services/Head Advisor at least two weeks in advance. Intern Licensure All incoming Pharm.D. students are required to apply for their intern license prior to matriculation. The OSU College of Pharmacy requires that all Pharm.D. st udents have an Oregon intern license. Any student that is unable to get licensed by the Oregon Board o f Pharmacy (OBOP) will not be allowed to matriculate or continue in the Pharm.D. program. Th e actual licenses will distributed within the first t wo weeks of the fall term. Your intern license allows you to participate in str uctured educational activities in a pharmacy immediately upon entering pharmacy school. These act ivities will progressively develop your competency in a practice setting, so that you are pr epared to assume the full scope of responsibilities of an intern by the end of the first professional year. 43 Please note that during the first year of you profe ssional program your license only allows you to act as an intern while completing course requirements for the professional program. You cannot use you licens e for any non-academic purposes, such as employment a s an intern, until you have satisfactorily completed the first year of the Pharm.D. program. It may be necessary for students to obtain an intern l icense in additional states, if they choose or are assigned to advanced clerkships outside the state of Ore gon during the fourth professional year. General and Professional Liability Insurance Each College of Pharmacy student is covered under ge neral liability and professional liability insurance through a commercial insurance policy purchased by t he Students of the Oregon University System. This insurance delivers liability insurance on an occurrenc e basis, with primary limits of not less than $1 million/$3 million. This policy covers students only when they are engage d in activities that constitute a required component of the professional pharmacy program. This policy does not cover activities a student engage s in as a component of his or her personal professional development plan that are not required c omponents of the pharmacy program, such as outside work as a pharmacy intern or volunteering at outreach events. In order to ensure that students are adequately cover ed during these outside activities, students are required to maintain individual liability insurance coverage. Student Health Services First and second professional year students are requir ed to pay OSU student health fees. Student health fees provide access to OSU's student health services, but do not provide for a personal or group health insurance plan. Third and fourth professional year stu dents are required to pay OHSU student health fees, which provide access to OHSU's student health servi ces. Student Health Services Records Requests Students can request copies of immunization documentat ion or other records from OSU's or OHSU's Student Health Services, as applicable. Such request s may take up to two weeks to process and students should plan accordingly. See their websites for more information and forms: http://studenthealth.oregonstate.edu/forms http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/student-services/josep h-trainer-health-wellness-center/ Student Health Insurance Requirement Pharmacy students are exposed to risks in experiential practice sites and on the OHSU medical campus. Additionally, many experiential practice sites requi re students to have adequate health insurance. Therefore, all students are required to purchase an O HSU student health insurance plan. While necessary due to the high level of coverage it provid es, this health insurance plan carries considerable cost and students should plan their personal budgets ac cordingly. 44 A student may be able to request that another health insurance plan, such as a plan provided by a spouse's employer, substitute for the OHSU plan. Student s must follow all OHSU procedures for requesting such a substitution. Waivers are only grante d to students who have another plan that is comparable in coverage. There is also a possibility th at a pre-existing health condition could result in an insurance requirement waiver. Contact OHSU Student H ealth Services for more information about pre- existing conditions and the insurance requirement. Waiver applications for new students are due 30 days b efore the first day of fall term classes. Waiver applications for continuing students are due before th e first day of fall term classes. Waivers must be renewed annually. The OHSU health insurance plan's enrollment and waiv er procedures are described in detail on the OHSU Student Health Services website: http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/student-services/josep h-trainer-health-wellness-center/insurance- plan/index.cfm 45 Student Standing in the College of Pharmacy The Academic and Professional Standards Committee (\" APSC\") may, at any time, review a student's standing in the College of Pharmacy. APSC is charged with ensuring that students are aware of academic performance or behavior which is not consistent with Essential Characteristics of Student Pharmacists and that, therefore, places their completion of the Pharm.D. program at risk. Academic performance and behavioral concerns are often evaluated independ ently but have equal significance in determining whether a student is meeting the Essential Characteri stics of Student Pharmacists. Severe, continuing or repeated academic or behavioral problems can result i n dismissal from the Pharm.D program. APSC, when necessary, provides Student Standing inform ation to communicate performance deficits, insufficient student progress, and lack of progress in a student addressing academic or behavioral problems. APSC and the College's Director of Student Services/Head Advisor provide students guidance regarding what the College expects from a student to increase their opportunities for success in the College. Student performance and progress are evaluat ed on a case-by-case basis, utilizing the experience of APSC members. APSC uses good faith, info rmed, academic judgment to determine appropriate recommendations for each student's situati on. The following Student Standing notifications may be received by students who are demonstrating performance deficits or insufficient progress in the Pharm.D. program. Warning Warning status is cautionary and identifies student per formance which may place a student's completion of the Pharm.D. program at risk. Students are placed on warning status if they have a t erm core pharmacy GPA of less than 2.5 or receive 2 or more C grades in core or elective professional c ourses in a term. Students may also be placed on Warning status if they engage in behavior that does n ot meet the Essential Characteristics of Student Pharmacists. The first time students are placed on Warning status, they must meet with the Director of Student Services/Head Advisor to discuss their situati on. The second time students are placed on Warning status, they must meet with the Director of Student Services/Head Advisor and develop a holistic action plan for overcoming academic and non-academic barriers to success. They must subsequently execute this action plan. The third time students are placed on Warning status, they are automatically placed on Probation. Probation Probation status identifies an academic or behavioral concern that places the student's completion of the Pharm.D. program at serious risk. Probation may be accompanied by a delay in progression at the determination of the APSC. 46 Students are placed on Probation status if they have a term core pharmacy GPA of less than a 2.0 or if they receive a C- or lower grade in any core or ele ctive professional course. A third warning automatically results in Probation. Student behavior that is a significant departure fro m the Essential Characteristics of Student Pharmacists will also result in Probation status. Such behavior includes, but is not limited to, violations of Academic Integrity policies, criminal violations, repeated or intentional violation of college polici es, or significant breaches of the University Student Condu ct Code (see http://oregonstate.edu/studentconduct/home/ ). Students on Probation status must follow recommendation s of the APSC and the Director of Student Services/Head Advisor. Students on Probation status must meet with the Director of Student Services/Head Advisor following each term to review t heir progress and standing in the College. Students that successfully fulfill the recommendations prescribed will be removed from Probation status. Students that fail to follow or are unsuccessful in f ulfilling the recommendations will be suspended and evaluated for dismissal from the College. Students who are placed on Probation status for a second time will also be evaluated for dismissal from the College. Suspension Students that have failed to make adequate progress, o r who have displayed severe or repeated departures from the Essential Characteristics of Studen t Pharmacists, may be placed on Suspension status. The College will place an indefinite hold on the progression of a student placed on Suspension status until APSC can adequately evaluate whether the student will be allowed to continue in the Pharm.D. program. Students engaged in an appeal of t heir dismissal from the College will also be placed on Suspension status. Students placed on Suspension status will not be allowed to progress in the Pharm.D. program. APSC will review the status of a student on Suspension no later than the beginning of the next academic term. After review, ASPC may recommend immediate Dismissal from the College, recommend that the student be continued on Suspension status pending receip t of additional information, or prescribe a plan to address specific concerns that resulted in the st udent's Suspension status. If a plan for progression is developed by APSC, the student will be c hanged to Probation status. If at any time it becomes evident that the student will not be able t o address concerns and graduate within the required five year window, the student will be dismissed immedi ately. Dismissal Students will be dismissed from the professional progra m if they are not making adequate academic progress, or if they fail to constructively address pro fessional or behavioral concerns. 47 Petitions, Appeals, and Grievances Petitions Requests to deviate from the Academic and Professiona l Standards, requests to deviate from the normal curriculum, and requests for other exceptions to Coll ege policies, rules, or standards must be approved by the college Academic and Professional Standards Co mmittee using the following process: 1.

The Federal government regulates drug approvals, drug manufacturing and labe ling and, in general, those aspects dealing with the product. Therefore, as Pharm.D. students and phar macists, you will deal mostly with the Oregon Board of Pharmacy or the pharmacy board in the stat e where you practice. As a Pharm.D. student, you will need to obtain an Int ernship License in order to work in a pharmacy and accrue internship hours necessary for professional lice nsure. In Oregon, you become eligible for an internship license upon matriculation to the first pro fessional (P1) year. Do not take the responsibilities that go with this license lightly. Under Oregon law and rules, pharmacy interns have the same responsibilities as a registered (licensed) pharmacist wi th the exception of the final check of the prescription. The college's professional curriculum is d esigned such that you should accumulate enough intern hours to be eligible to take the NAPLEX and M ultistate Jurisprudence Examination (MJPE) immediately following graduation. Internship licenses are not issued by the College of Pha rmacy, but by the pharmacy board(s) for the state(s) in which you plan to intern. Internship licen sure requirements vary from state to state. Most state pharmacy boards recognize intern hours earned in another state, but they usually require that you use the forms from the state where you will receive yo ur initial license. For example, you might want to be licensed in California, but because of our curricu lum, you will be earning intern hours in Oregon. You would need both California and Oregon intern license s. It is your responsibility to check with the pharmacy board in the state where you plan to pract ice. Links to all of the state pharmacy boards can be found at the National Association of Boards of Pharmac y website. ( www.nabp.net ) The College of Pharmacy maintains an excellent worki ng relationship with the Oregon Board of Pharmacy. Indeed, several faculty members have served or are currently serving on the Oregon Board, including John Block, Professor Emeritus, Ann Zweber, Senior Instructor and former Board President, and Roberto Linares, Assistant Instructor. The Board hol ds one of its meetings each year at the college. In the beginning of your P1 year, Board staff will m eet with your class to answer your questions and help you with the intern license application. The Board a lso meets with the required pharmacy law course. Professional licensure is required to practice as a Pha rmacist in the United States. This licensure is not conferred by the OSU College of Pharmacy, but by th e pharmacy board in the state where you graduated from pharmacy school. Pharm.D. graduates mu st successfully complete the NAPLEX and MJPE in order to be licensed. These are computer adaptive exams offered throughout the year at commercial testing centers. All states recognize the NAPLEX and m ost states the MJPE. The latter will have specific questions covering pharmacy law in the state where you will be initially licensed. Should you later reciprocate to another state, you will need to take the drug law exam (usually the MJPE) for that state. 64 Oregon Board of Pharmacy The Oregon Board of Pharmacy was established by legis lative action in 1891. The mission of the Oregon Board of Pharmacy is to promote, preserve, and protect the public health, s afety and welfare by regulating the practice of pharmacy and the quality and distribution of drugs and medical devices. The Board of Pharmacy has the responsibility to regul ate the practice of pharmacy and enforce the laws pertaining to drug outlets, pharmacists and the sale of drugs within the state of Oregon. The Board of Pharmacy generally meets every other month for a two -day meeting where cases are presented and current issues confronting the Board are decided. These meetings are open to the public. The Oregon Board of Pharmacy consists of seven members . Five of these members are licensed pharmacists and two are representatives of the public . Each member of the Board is appointed by the Governor, subject to the advice and consent of the Se nate, for a period of four years. No member of the Board serves more than two consecutive full terms. The Board is supported by the agency staff, which incl udes an Executive Director, Administrative Director, Office Manager, and Pharmacy Recovery Net work Program Director. Office staff includes a Project Manager, Pharmacist Consultant (Public Inform ation Officer), Administrative Secretary, and Receptionist. Three Licensing Representatives manage the licensing of pharmacists, interns, preceptors, technicians, wholesalers and drug outlets. Compliance staff consists of a Compliance Director, Compliance Secretary, and five Pharmacy Inspectors. The Oregon Board of Pharmacy invites students, pharma cists, and the public to participate in meetings, ask questions, and request information or clarification at any time. We look forward to working with you to promote, preserve, and protect the public health, safety and welfare. Oregon Board of Pharmacy 800 NE Oregon St., Suite 150 Portland, Oregon All incoming Pharm.D. students are required to apply for their intern license prior to matriculation. The OSU College of Pharmacy requires that all Pharm.D. st udents have an Oregon intern license. Any student that is unable to get licensed by the Oregon Board o f Pharmacy (OBOP) will not be allowed to matriculate or continue in the Pharm.D. program. Th e actual license will be distributed during the firs t two weeks of fall term. Your intern license allows you to participate in str uctured educational activities in a pharmacy immediately upon entering pharmacy school. These act ivities will progressively develop your competency in a practice setting, so that you are pr epared to assume the full scope of responsibilities of an intern by the end of the first professional year. Please note that during the first year of your prof essional program your license only allows you to act a s an intern while completing course requirements for t he professional program. You cannot use you license for any non-academic purposes, such as employmen t as an intern, until you have satisfactorily completed the first year of the Pharm.D. program. The Oregon Board of Pharmacy will run a separate bac kground check for licensure. They will not accept the background check required by the College of Pha rmacy. Please read the Intern Regulations - Division 031 ver y closely before submitting your application. As an intern you are responsible for knowing and upholding these regulations. Other States internship license prior to starting Pharmacy School (assuming they can present a letter of acceptance to a Pharm.D. program). Students interested in interning outside Oregon should consult the Board of Pharmacy for the state in which they would like to intern to determine licensure requirements. Internship paperwork generally requires the signatur e of the Director of Student Services/Head Advisor. Please complete and submit internship paperwork allow ing at least one week for processing. 66 Section 6: Student and Professional Organizations Student Organization Chart Executive Council Officers 2013-2014 President: Patrick Jessina McGregor 67 Oregon State Student Pharmacists (OSSP) Oregon State Student Pharmacists (OSSP) is a combinat ion of the student branches of several professional pharmacy organizations, including: American Pharmacists Association (APhA) National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA) Oregon Society of Health-System Pharmacists (OSHP) American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) Oregon State Pharmacy Association (OSPA) American College of Clinical Pharmacy (ACCP) Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy (AMCP) OSSP also includes pharmacy student groups from OSU's campus.

I will consider the welfare of humanity and relief of human suffering my primary concerns. I will apply my knowledge, experience, and skills to the best of my ability to assure optimal drug therapy outcomes for the patients I serve. I will keep abreast of developments and maintain prof essional competency in my profession of pharmacy. I will maintain the highest principles of moral, ethi cal, and legal conduct. I will embrace and advocate change in the profession of pharmacy that improves patient care. I take these vows voluntarily with the full realizat ion of the responsibility with which I am entrusted by the public. Developed by the American Pharmaceutical Associatio n Academy of Students of Pharmacy and the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy Council of Deans Task Force on Professiona lism, June 26, 1994. 75 Appendix C: Code of Ethics Preamble Pharmacists are health professionals who assist ind ividuals in making the best use of medications. This code, prepared and supported by pharmacists, is int ended to state publicly the principles that form th e fundamental basis of the roles and responsibilities of pharmacists. These principles, based on moral obligations and virtues, are established to guide pha rmacists in relationships with patients, health professionals, and society. A Pharmacist respects the covenantal relationship b etween the patient and pharmacist. Considering the patient-pharmacist relationship as a covenant means that a pharmacist has moral obligations in response to the gift of trust received from society. In return for this gift, a pharmacist promises to help individual achieve optimum benefit from their medications, to be committed to their welfare, and to maintain their trust. A Pharmacist promotes the good of every patient in a caring, compassionate, and confidential manner. A pharmacist places concern for the well-being of th e patient at the center of professional practice. I n doing so, a pharmacist considers needs stated by the patient as well as those defined by health science . A pharmacist is dedicated to protecting the dignity of the patient. With a caring attitude and a compassionate spirit, a pharmacist focuses on servi ng the patient in a private and confidential manner . A Pharmacist respects the autonomy and dignity of e ach patient. A pharmacist promotes the right of self-determinatio n and recognizes individual self-worth by encouraging patients to participate in decisions abou t their health. A pharmacist communicates with patients in terms that are understandable. In all c ases, a pharmacist respects personal and cultural differences among patients. A Pharmacist acts with honesty and integrity in pro fessional relationships. A pharmacist has a duty to tell the truth and to ac t with conviction of conscience. A pharmacist avoid s discriminatory practices, behavior or work conditio ns that impair professional judgment, and actions t hat compromise dedication to the best interest of patie nts. A Pharmacist maintains professional competence. A pharmacist has a duty to maintain knowledge and ab ilities as new medications, devices, and technologies become available and as health informat ion advances. A Pharmacist respects the values and abilities of c olleagues and other health professionals. When appropriate, a pharmacist asks for the consult ation of colleagues or other health professionals or refers the patient. A pharmacist acknowledges that c olleagues and other health professionals may differ in the beliefs and values they apply to the care of the patient. A Pharmacist serves individual, community, and soci etal needs. The primary obligation of a pharmacist is to individ ual patients. However, the obligations of a pharmaci st may at times extend beyond the individual to the co mmunity and society. In these situations, the pharmacist recognizes the responsibilities that acco mpany these obligations and acts accordingly. A Pharmacist seeks justice in the distribution of h ealth resources. When health resources are allocated, a pharmacist i s fair and equitable, balancing the needs of patient s and society. Developed by the American Pharmaceutical Associatio n Academy of Students of Pharmacy and the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy Council of Deans Task Force on Professiona lism, June 26, 2004. 76 Appendix D: Pledge of Professionalism As a student of pharmacy, I believe there is a need t o build and reinforce a professional identity founded on integrity, ethical behavior, and honor. This deve lopment, a vital process in my education, will help t o ensure that I am true to the professional relationship I establish between myself and society as I become a member of the pharmacy community. Integrity will be an essential part of my everyday life, and I will pursue all academic and professional endeavors with hon esty and commitment to service. To accomplish this goal of professional development, as a student of pharmacy I will: DEVELOP a sense of loyalty and duty to the profession by con tribution to the well-being of others and by enthusiastically accepting responsibilit y and accountability for membership in the profession. FOSTER professional competency through lifelong learning. I will strive for high ideals, teamwork, and unity within the profession in order t o provide optimal patient care. SUPPORT my colleagues by actively encouraging personal commi tment to the Oath of a Pharmacist and the Code of Ethics as set forth by the p rofession. DEDICATE my life and practice to excellence. This will requi re an ongoing reassessment of personal and professional values. MAINTAIN the highest ideals and professional attributes to ensur e and facilitate the covenantal relationship required of the pharmaceutic al caregiver. The profession of pharmacy is one that demands adheren ce to a set of ethical principles. These high ideals are necessary to ensure the quality of care e xtended to the patients I serve. As a student of pharmacy, I believe this does not start with graduati on; rather, it begins with my membership in this professional college community. Therefore, I will stri ve to uphold this pledge as I advance toward full membership in the profession. I voluntarily make this pledge of professionalism. 77 Appendix E: Incident Report Form 78 INCIDENT REPORT FORM (Page 1 of 2) This form is to be used to report bodily fluid expo sures, needle sticks, and similar injuries to Colle ge of Pharmacy faculty, staff and students.
