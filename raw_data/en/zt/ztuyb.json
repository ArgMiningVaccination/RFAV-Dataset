Thyroid hormones May increase thyroid hormone levels Drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system (eg, warfarin, calcium channel blockers, antiseizure medications) May increase the risk of bleeding or lower blood pressure with calcium channel blockers or sedation with antiseizure tricyclic antidepressants) Can increase the effect of these drugs and make people too drowsy Acetaminophen and valproic acid May increase the chance of liver injury Antiseizure medications May increase effect of these medications and may increase adverse effects Lithium May increase lithium toxicity Barbiturates and other sedatives May intensify or prolong effects of sedatives because its volatile oils have additive effects Iron supplements May reduce iron absorption via tannins in the plant Warfarin May increase risk of bleeding because chamomile contains phytocoumarins, which may have additive effects Drugs with estrogenic effects (eg, tamoxifen, hormone replacement therapy, oral contraceptives containing estrogens) May interfere with the estrogenic effects of these drugs Cyclosporine May increase cyclosporine serum concentrations Insulin, sulfonylureas May lower blood glucose Thyroid replacement therapy May decrease levothyroxine serum levels Warfarin May decrease response to warfarin Antihypertensives May augment antihypertensive and blood pressure-lowering effects Chemotherapy drugs May interfere with the action of chemotherapy drugs due to antioxidant effects Anticoagulants (eg, warfarin) Increases the risk of bleeding Antidepressants May trigger mania Drugs with anti-estrogenic effects (eg, tamoxifen, anastrozole, and fulvestrant) May decrease May increase the sedative effect Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine (for tuberculosis) May decrease the effectiveness of the BCG vaccine Ephedra Stimulant drugs (eg, caffeine, epinephrine, phenylpropanolamine, pseudoephedrine) Increases the stimulant effects of other drugs, increasing risk of irregular or rapid heartbeat and hypertension MAOIs May intensify effects of these drugs and increase risk of adverse effects (eg, headache, tremors, irregular or rapid heartbeat, hypertension) Antimigraine drugs (eg, ergotamine\u2014see table ) May increase heart rate and blood pressure because it has additive vasoconstrictive effects Antiplatelet drugs May increase risk of bleeding because feverfew inhibits platelet aggregation (has additive effects) NSAIDs Increased risk of bleeding, because both feverfew and NSAIDs may potentially cause bleeding Warfarin May increase risk of bleeding because warfarin may have additive effects Antihypertensives May augment antihypertensive and blood pressure-lowering effects Antiplatelet drugs May increase risk of bleeding because these drugs enhance garlic's inhibition of platelet aggregation and fibrinolytic effects May levels Protease inhibitors (eg, saquinavir) Blood level of protease inhibitors reduced by garlic Warfarin May increase risk of bleeding by augmenting warfarin's anticoagulant effects Tacrolimus (oral) Can increase blood levels of tacrolimus, possibly enough to injure the liver Antiplatelet drugs May increase risk of bleeding by augmenting inhibition of platelet aggregation Warfarin May anticoagulant effects Antiseizure medications (eg, phenytoin) May reduce efficacy of antiseizure medications because contaminants in ginkgo preparations may reduce antiseizure effects Antidepressants May precipitate serotonin syndrome in patients on other antidepressant medications MAOIs (eg, tranylcypromine) May intensify effects of these drugs and increase risk of adverse effects (eg, headache, tremors, manic episodes) NSAIDs May increase risk of bleeding by augmenting inhibition of antiplatelet aggregation Warfarin May anticoagulant effects Antihyperglycemic drugs (eg, glipizide) May intensify effects of these drugs, causing hypoglycemia Aspirin and other NSAIDs May increase risk of bleeding by augmenting inhibition of antiplatelet aggregation Corticosteroids May intensify adverse effects of corticosteroids because ginseng has anti-inflammatory effects May have immunostimulant effects and thus may attenuate the immunosuppressive effects of corticosteroids Digoxin May increase digoxin levels Estrogens May intensify adverse effects of estrogen MAOIs Can cause headache, tremors, and manic episodes Opioids May reduce the effectiveness of opioids Warfarin May increase risk of bleeding by augmenting warfarin's Antihypertensives Berberine content may Berberine may increase hypoglycemic effects Warfarin and heparin May increase effects of warfarin and heparin, increasing risk of bleeding Warfarin May reduce efficacy of warfarin, increasing risk of thromboembolism Thyroid hormones May decrease the efficacy of thyroid hormone drugs Anticoagulants and antiplatelets May increase risk of bleeding Sedatives (eg, barbiturates, benzodiazepines) May intensify or prolong the effects of sedatives Antiparkinsonian medications May antagonize effects of levodopa and worsen Parkinson disease May reduce metabolism of ropinirole and thus cause dopamine toxicity Hepatotoxic drugs May increase hepatotoxicity Antihypertensives May increase salt and water retention and increase blood pressure, making antihypertensives less effective Chemotherapeutics May decrease effects of paclitaxel and cisplatin Corticosteroids May increase adverse effects of corticosteroids Digoxin May decrease levels of potassium, which increases risk of digoxin toxicity Diuretics May intensify the potassium-wasting effects of most diuretics and interfere with the effectiveness of potassium-sparing diuretics (eg, spironolactone) MAOIs May intensify effects of these drugs and increase risk of adverse effects (eg, headache, tremors, manic episodes) Warfarin May decrease effectiveness of warfarin Anticoagulants (such as warfarin) May increase risk of bleeding Antiseizure medications May decrease the effectiveness of antiseizure medications Benzodiazepines May increase sedative effect Methamphetamine May increase the adverse effects of methamphetamine Antihyperglycemic drugs May intensify effects of these drugs, causing hypoglycemia Protease inhibitors (eg, indinavir, saquinavir) May interfere with metabolizing enzymes, lowering blood levels of indinavir Sirolimus May decrease sirolimus clearance in renal transplant patients with hepatic impairment Warfarin May increase risk of bleeding by increasing effects Antidepressants May cause a rapid heart rate Anticoagulants (eg, warfarin) May increase blood levels causing increased risk of bleeding Anti-inflammatory drugs Increased blood levels and possibly adverse effects Immunosuppressants May decrease effectiveness of immunosuppressants Antihyperglycemic medications Can decrease blood glucose, triggering hypoglycemia Antihypertensive medications Can decrease blood pressure further Antidepressants May increase serotonin levels causing serotonin syndrome when given with serotonergic drugs, manifested by a rapid heart rate, anxiety, gastrointestinal symptoms, severe muscle rigidity, and possible seizures Levodopa May decrease the effectiveness of levodopa Antiplatelets and anticoagulants (eg, warfarin) May increase effects and may cause bleeding Estrogens (eg, oral contraceptives and other products) May decrease effectiveness of estrogens Cyclosporine and tacrolimus May reduce blood level of cyclosporine, increasing risk of organ transplant rejection Digoxin May reduce blood level of digoxin, making it less effective, with potentially dangerous results Iron supplements May reduce iron absorption MAOIs May augment effects of MAOIs, possibly causing very high blood pressure requiring emergency treatment Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors Increases metabolism of these drugs, reducing their efficacy Oral contraceptives Increases metabolism of these drugs, reducing their efficacy Oxycodone, methadone, and tramadol Decreases serum concentrations and analgesic drugs Photosensitizing drugs (eg, lansoprazole, omeprazole, piroxicam, sulfonamide antibiotics) May increase sun sensitivity Protease inhibitors May reduce blood level of protease inhibitors, reducing their efficacy SSRIs (eg, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline) May augment effects of these drugs Tricyclic antidepressants May augment effects of these drugs Warfarin and other anticoagulants (eg, direct-acting oral anticoagulants) May reduce blood level of warfarin and rivaroxaban, increasing risk of thromboembolism Sedatives (eg, barbiturates, effects of sedatives Antibiotics (eg, cephalexin, tetracyclines, quinolones) May decrease absorption and effect of the antibiotics when taken within hours of zinc Cisplatin, penicillamine, and chelate integrase inhibitors (eg, dolutegravir) May be inhibited or inactivated * Caution is required when dietary supplements are used because these products are not standardized and thus vary considerably and because information about their use is continually changing. The theoretical status of many published interactions does not obviate the need for cautious use. Before prescribing any drug, health care practitioners should ask patients whether they are taking dietary supplements and, if so, which ones. Practitioners must identify any potential adverse interactions of drugs and supplements taken by a patient and then determine appropriate drugs and dosages. Sale of supplements containing ephedra is banned in the US. This substance is true, natural licorice, not the more common, artificially flavored licorice reuptake inhibitors. "}
