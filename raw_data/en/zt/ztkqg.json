If you are struggling with acne, eczema or fatigue, liver detox is a good place to start.", "sitename": "Homeopathy with Tracy", "date": "2022-09-16", "cleaned_text": "Signs your liver needs a gentle detox Did you know that hundreds of your body functions are carried out by your liver? Three of the most important functions of the liver: - Detoxify chemicals - Process nutrients - Regulate hormones When your liver is congested you feel sluggish and irritable, especially first thing in the morning and after lunch. When it's healthy and clear, you feel bright and energised throughout the day. When was the last time you felt that way? How to know if you need a liver detox How many of these can you tick? - Poor sleep - Morning fatigue - Mid-afternoon slump - Poor memory and concentration - Mood swings or irritability - Sensitive to noise - Bloating, gas - Constipation or diarrhoea - Migraine or frequent headaches - PMS - Hot flashes or night sweats at [perimenopause](http://homeopathywithtracy.co.uk/blog/peri-menopause-re-framed/) - Acne, including adult acne - Eczema or itchy skin - Low immunity Drugs, medication and your liver Have you ever taken over-the-counter medicines such as: - painkillers - antihistamines - acid reflux medicine Or maybe prescribe medicines such as: - antibiotics - anti-depressants - birth control - accutane They all contain chemicals that block your body's normal processes. All drugs need to be processed by the liver, stomach, gut, kidneys, blood and lymphatic system. Two main causes of liver toxicity 1. Coffee, alcohol, sugar and processed foods The typical 21st-century diet includes some of those, at least for most people. These are rarely the main issue though. 2. Drugs and hormones These are the main cause of liver toxicity. Women take more medication than men. - Courses of [antibiotics](http://homeopathywithtracy.co.uk/blog/antibiotics-gut-health/)for tonsillitis or UTI - Painkillers for headaches and period pain - Birth control and/or morning after pill and medical abortion - Anti-histamines and steroids for allergy - PPIs (Gaviscon, Lansoprazole etc.) for heartburn - Laxatives and diarrhoea drugs for bowel issues - Cannesten and Fluconazole for candida Most people grow up with visits to the GP and the pharmacy and take medicine when they don't feel well. Not because they want to, but because they want to get on with their life. Does this resonate with you? (That was the story of my life until my mid-twenties when I went to see a homeopath for the first time.) It's a simple fact that drugs, hormones and other medication build toxicity in the liver. This is a hidden cause of many chronic health issues.
