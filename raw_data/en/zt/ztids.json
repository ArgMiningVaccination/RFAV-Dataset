The vision for Africa, particularly in the post Covid-19 world, is that people in every corner of Africa, have timely access to safe, effective, quality medicines, vaccines, medical devices, diagnostics and technology. The increased burden of infectious, neglected tropical, communicable and non-communicable disease is growing rapidly in Africa, coupled with the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance and pandemics. All medicinal products require effective regulation and multi-disciplinary approaches from appropriate training and capacity building right through to manufacturing and regulatory agility, inspections, effective safety surveillance and ultimately timely access for patients. The key to optimising sustainability in the supply of medicinal and healthcare products for diseases disproportionately affecting Africa includes a fully established Africa Medicines Agency (AMA), and once the fifteenth country in Africa has ratified the Treaty, the AMA will come into existence. It will foster regulatory system strengthening and reliance across Africa towards faster and expanded access to medicines, vaccines and biotherapeutics for patients. AMA will coordinate existing regulatory harmonisation efforts in the region and provide regulatory guidance, scientific opinions and a common framework.
