[Spider veins](https://www.yourveincarecenter.com/vein-disease/spider-veins/) are a common byproduct of the aging process, but they are not restricted to the senior set. These visible red and blue vein networks can appear during any season of life, causing cosmetic embarrassment when they occur in prominent areas like the lower legs and face. If you are fed up with hiding your spider veins, maybe it's time to say goodbye to them for good. When it comes to eliminating the pesky vessels, what options do you have? Are natural remedies a viable option? Why do spider veins occur? To determine the best way to treat spider veins, it is helpful to know why they form in the first place. Spider veins usually develop in a network that might resemble a spider's web or a starburst pattern. They may be red or blue, and some of them can become quite large. The most common areas to find spider veins are on the leg, particularly behind the knee, and on the face. However, these visible vessels can show up nearly anywhere on the body. Causes of spider veins vary and might include: - Hormonal fluctuations - Injury or trauma to the skin - Excessive sun exposure - Some medications, including anabolic steroids - Excessive alcohol consumption (facial veins) The primary risk for spider veins is genetics, which means if one or both of your parents have them, you are more apt to develop them as well. Other factors that could increase your likelihood of developing these networks include obesity, a sedentary lifestyle or long periods on your feet during the day. Options in Natural Spider Vein Remedies Natural remedies are often the first choice for spider vein sufferers that don't want to resort to medical treatment to eliminate the vessels. The natural approach is attractive because it does not require a prescription or therapy administered by a physician. Many of these solutions are as close as the neighborhood grocery store. Some of the most popular natural remedies for spider veins include: Apple Cider Vinegar Apple cider vinegar is touted for addressing a wide range of conditions and concerns, including spider veins. The substance is known to improve healthy blood flow and circulation which is thought to reduce the formation of spider and [varicose veins](https://www.yourveincarecenter.com/vein-disease/varicose-veins/). Most recommendations entail applying the apple cider vinegar directly to the skin. In some cases, users are advised to wrap a piece of cloth in the vinegar and then wrap it around the area for a period of 20 to 30 minutes at a time. Diet Eating foods that reduce inflammation and promote healthy blood flow is also thought to keep spider veins at bay. Foods that are high in fiber and antioxidants support the overall health of the body, including the circulatory system. Other nutrients to watch for in your daily fare might include magnesium, potassium and omega-3 fatty acids. At the same time, avoiding saturated fats, processed sugar, alcohol and sodium may go far in the maintaining healthy circulation over the long term. Herbal Supplements Supplements are another popular remedy for spider veins as well as a myriad of other ills. Spider veins, in particular, respond well to the external application of witch hazel, as well as oral doses of gingko biloba, bilberry and horse chestnut. Other supplements commonly recommended for spider veins include garlic, turmeric and cayenne pepper. If your veins are causing symptoms like heaviness or aching in the legs at the end of the day, butcher's broom might be a good choice. Essential Oils Essential oils are another natural solution for a wide range of health conditions. When it comes to nipping spider veins in the bud, the best oils to keep on hand include: - Tea tree - Geranium - Cypress - Lemongrass - Lavender - Yarrow Essential oils can be applied via a hot or cold compress, in a bath or as a massage oil. Some oils can also be used directly on the skin, but it is essential to be sure the oil is not one that will cause irritation or burning. Massage Massage is thought to work on spider veins because it is an effective way to stimulate healthy blood circulation. This approach can also relieve pain and swelling that is sometimes associated with spider veins. Massage should only be performed by a licensed therapist and preferably by someone with experience treating spider veins. Is going natural the right choice? Natural remedies are often a first option in treating any condition, including spider veins. The products are usually readily available, do not require a prescription and are not overly expensive. Because they are natural, the solutions are often touted as the healthier option as well. However, natural products are not always as safe as one might assume. These treatments are not approved by the FDA, while treatments performed in our office at the Vein Care Center do have FDA approval. We can discuss both non-approved and approved treatment options at your consultation to help you understand the difference and make the right choice for you. Some supplements can also have side effects or interact with other medications. It is always best to let your doctor know before you take any herbal supplement to ensure it is appropriate for you. While natural ingredients may improve circulation, which can help to lower your risk for spider veins, they are not effective in eliminating the visible vessels that have already appeared. Some may diminish their appearance for a short period, but since they are not treating the source of the issue, the effects will not be long-lasting. When Natural Treatments Don't Work If you have tried natural treatments to your spider veins to no avail, there is another solution. [Sclerotherapy](https://www.yourveincarecenter.com/vein-treatment/sclerotherapy/) is a minimally-invasive procedure that can be performed right in your doctor's office without the need for incisions or anesthesia. Instead, a sterile solution is injected into the affected veins that causes the vessel to seal closed and collapse. The vessel is reabsorbed by the body over time and is no longer visible on the skin's surface.

This procedure continues to be a top choice for patients at the Vein Care Center that would like to say goodbye to spider veins with permanent results.
