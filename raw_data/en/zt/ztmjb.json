It helps us to relax, clears our mind and releases negative energy and unwanted thoughts. Using crystals for meditation is a powerful way to deepen your meditation, as well as achieve a specific outcome during your meditation. On a spiritual level, meditating with crystals can help to raise your consciousness and awareness, deepening your intuition and bringing insight. Whether you're a frequent meditator or you're just getting started, and regardless of how long you've been working with crystals, bringing these two energetic practices together unlocks a new way to take care of yourself. And with so many different stones available, there's truly a crystal for every kind of meditative experience you could wish for. If you're not sure what your goal for your meditation practice is, it's fun to experiment and meditate with different healing stones and crystals to get a feel for their energies and how they can enhance your practice. Once you pick up on the different combination of energies, you can begin to incorporate a variety of different meditations into your daily life. And while there are some stones that are particularly useful, any stone or crystal can be used for meditation. Let crystals be the tools to help you start and maintain your meditation practice, connect with a specific intention or goal, and move into deeper states of meditation. The more you begin to practice meditating with crystals, the more you'll want to experience different energies. Here are some different ways you can incorporate meditating with crystals into your everyday life: Must-Have Tools, Crystals and Stones for Meditation We always recommend everyone have two crystals for meditation\u2014quartz crystal and selenite crystal. As some of the best crystals for a mediation practice, these are our go-to stones for when you're just starting out. There are also some other energy tools you can use to enhance your meditation. Clear Quartz This is one of the best crystals for meditation because it can be programmed with your specific intention for your meditation. If you're asking a question looking for a mental breakthrough, this is the stone you need. Clear Quartz crystals bring clarity of the mind and help you to become more focused and clear about your dreams. They also amplify the energy of any other crystal, making it ideal to use in any other crystal meditation. Selenite This crystal is beneficial for meditation because it helps you to clear your mind and relax your body. Selenite healing properties facilitate the release of negative energy and energy blockages to energetically cleanse your body. This crystal also brings a flow of positive energy to raise your vibration and elevate your state. While any Selenite crystal is a powerful tool for meditation, a pair of Selenite harmonizers help you to achieve balance, equilibrium, and peace through your meditation session. Incense Sacred smoke has been used to help induce meditation for centuries. Pick a scent of incense that resonates with you to help you find peace as you enter a meditative state. Frankincense Resin is one of our favorite meditation incenses. Palm Stones Palm stones or touchstones are a great tool for beginners or seasoned meditators. They're stones that are larger than normal tumbled stones, so they fit comfortably in the palm of your hand. As you meditate, hold one stone in each hand and feel the energy of the stones flowing into your body and calming your mind. They also give you something tangible to connect with, making your meditation a physical practice, as well as a mental and emotional one.
