Here's what you should know about the different forms of external energy therapy for functional medicine. What is External Energy Therapy? External energy therapy is the practice of balancing the energy channels or fields that exist within the body in order to achieve wellness. Practitioners of external energy therapy believe that disruption or blockage in these energy channels will often result in the symptoms of illness or disease. There are several different kinds of energy therapies\u2014some, like reiki and qigong, are ancient practices and have been used to treat chronic pain, stress, anxiety, and other somatic illnesses. What Are the Different Types of External Energy Therapy? There are two main forms of external energy therapy: - Bioelectromagnetic-based therapies, which include the use of pulsed or alternating current electromagnetic fields to target symptoms of depression, stress, and pain. This includes Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulators (TENS), and Pulsed Electromagnetic Field (PEMF) - Biofield therapies, which focus on healing the energy biofield that surrounds every human body. This includes therapeutic touch, reiki, and qigong What Are the Benefits of External Energy Therapy? As a drug-free and non-invasive form of functional medicine, external energy therapy offers multiple benefits to patients. It can: - Reduce chronic and acute pain - Treat symptoms of depression and anxiety - Improve mobility, and help with pain associated with knee osteoarthritis - Improve mood and emotional well-being - Improve sleep - Reduce fatigue, especially in patients undergoing chemotherapy What to Expect During an External Energy Therapy Session Your external energy therapy session will differ depending on the type of treatment that's right for you. A certified practitioner at One Source Integrative Medicine will begin your initial appointment by asking you a series of detailed health questions to get to know your complete health history, including your mental and emotional health. From there, the practitioner will recommend a form of external energy therapy that's right for you. Qigong, reiki, and therapeutic touch sessions typically last anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes in length. Bioelectromagnetic-based treatments occur in clinical settings and involve magnetic coils to send magnetic pulses to the affected parts of your body. These sessions typically last no more than 30 minutes. Patients of either form of external energy therapy report immediate results, but often prefer recurring appointments to maintain their levels of wellness.
