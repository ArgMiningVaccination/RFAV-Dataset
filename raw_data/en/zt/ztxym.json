It holds special significance for our vast world of pharmacy. New areas of research are increasing our pharmaceutical knowledge base at an exponential rate. Areas such as genomics, proteomics, nanomedicine/nanotechnology, pharmacoepidemiology, and pharmacoeconomics hold significant promise for the future, as we seek to discover novel approaches to continuously improve our translational research outcomes and the pharmaceutical care that we deliver to our patients. Our UHCOP Curriculum and Assessment Committees are diligently working together to redesign, update and continually assess our cutting-edge professional curriculum and to ensure that we are incorporating important areas, such as the aforementioned, that will enable our graduates to better create and lead our nation's future healthcare delivery systems. The continual process of updating/re-engineering our professional program curriculum is a critical step in positioning our College and its graduates to help lead the national initiative of improving our US Healthcare System's effectiveness and efficiency. The Texas Medical Center (TMC), under the leadership and vision of its new CEO Dr. Robert Robbins, is also in the process of re-engineering its strategic plan. I recently attended an exciting TMC Strategic Planning Retreat where discussions centered upon elevating the TMC and its member institutions to even greater national/international prominence in the key areas of teaching, research and clinical care delivery (http://tinyurl.com/tmc-plan1-14 ). Our College of Pharmacy and University will play key roles in the development of the new TMC Strategic Plan. This important initiative comes at a critical juncture that should have a tremendously positive effect upon our region, state, and the future of our nation's healthcare system. Our University of Houston, under the leadership and vision of Chancellor Renu Khator, has established a new Health Sciences Center. The new UH Health Sciences Center will bring together UH's wide-ranging health-related educational and research programs together with new innovative future programs into a multi-campus academic health sciences center that will help provide critical improvements for our nation's future healthcare system. This important initiative will also lead to enhancing interprofessional education and healthcare team-building opportunities which will replace traditional academic and professional silos. This will provide a sound foundation for providing collaborative solutions to problems that have plagued our \"siloed\" U.S. healthcare system for decades. I look forward to providing you with important updates surrounding our new UH Health Sciences Center and our College's collaborative role in this exciting strategic initiative. F.

University of Houston College of Pharmacy 3COLLEGE NEWS UH College of Pharmacy Dean F. Lamar Pritchard, Ph.D., R.Ph., recently announced appointments to several key administrative leadership positions and the creation of a new administrative/ academic department within the college. \"I am very pleased that we are able to move forward with these important UHCOP organizational updates as our team continues to strive to accomplish the laudable goals set forth by our Vision 2020 Strategic Plan,\" Pritchard said. Clinical Associate Professor Andrea L. Smesny, Pharm.D., MPH, R.Ph., who served at the assistant and associate dean levels over academic affairs for the professional program since 2004, has been appointed Executive Associate Dean of the college. Her new responsibilities include overseeing the Development and Business offices; serving as liaison with UH on university- wide initiatives; leading new initiatives and coordinating execution of formal agreements with other UH units and external parties; overseeing and moving key college initiatives forward (strategic plan, accreditation, etc.); and advising the dean on personnel and budget matters. Paige Pitman, Pharm.D., MBA, B.S. ('94), clinical assistant professor, has been appointed as the new Assistant Dean of Student & Professional Affairs for the Pharm.D. program. From 1999 to 2007, Pitman served as a UHCOP faculty member and director of Pharm.D. Admissions & Recruiting before taking a position in health- system pharmacy. She returned to the college in 2010 as a faculty member and director, Institutional Based Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences. Pitman succeeds Barbara Lewis, M.A., LPC-S, R.Ph. (B.S. '74), who has retired from the college. Responsibilities for the Pharm.D. Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experiences (IPPEs) have been split between clinical associate professors Lynn Simpson, Pharm.D. ('97), and Cathy Hatfield , Pharm.D. Simpson will serve as Director of Ambulatory IPPEs and Hatfield, who has been spearheading the college's interprofessional education (IPE) collaborations with medical and nursing schools, will serve as Director of Institutional IPPEs. The new Department of Pharmaceutical Health Outcomes and Policy was established to allow faculty, students and staff members to focus on the national priority of providing patients, clinicians and policymakers with the scientific evidence to make informed health decisions. The department will be chaired by Professor Rajender R. Aparasu, Ph.D., M.Pharm., FAPhA, and comprised of faculty members Susan Hua Chen, M.D., Ph.D.; E. James Essien, Fleming, and Sujit Sansgiry, Ph.D. A phase-out of the Pharmacy Administration graduate degree name has been approved by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. Pritchard Announces Leadership Appointments, New Department Smesny Aparasu Simpson Hatfield Pitman UH College of Pharmacy recently welcomed two new members to the Dean's Advisory Council: NASA's Lakshmi Putcha Business Council's Michael Wright . A pioneer and expert in Space Pharmacotherapeutics, Putcha is chief pharmacologist and technical manager of Pharmacotherapeutics Laboratories at NASA Johnson Space Center. With two master's degrees and a doctorate in Biopharmaceutics and Clinical Pharmacokinetics from UH, Putcha is the only clinical pharmacologist at NASA who directs and conducts research and development for optimizing pharmacotherapeutics in space. Putcha is a recipient of numerous honors and awards at NASA, including the Special Space Flight Achievement Award, Certificate of Commendation and Space Act Award. She holds adjunct faculty positions at UH, The University of Texas Medical Branch, Texas Southern University and the University of Florida, and is a Fellow of the American College of Clinical Pharmacology. Wright is a graduate of the University of Northern Iowa and a highly decorated veteran of the Vietnam War. A senior lobbyist for Hoffmann-LA Roche for 37 years, Wright has worked with policymakers on a variety of topics including Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement, patient access and rights, scope of practice issues, taxation, and tort reform. Wright most recently was Director of Public Affairs for the Texas Pharmacy Association. He has been a member of TPA for more than 25 years, including serving on the TPA Board of Directors and as Vice Chairman of the TPA Foundation. He is active in multiple organizations in the Austin area, including serving on the RxWiki Corporate Advisory Board and the Dell Hospital NW Circle of Friends. DAC Welcomes NASA's Putcha, Pharmacy Business Council's Wright Putcha WrightUH College of Pharmacy has hit several milestones in the implementation of its multifaceted Hispanic Healthcare Initiative, which is designed to deliver - and prepare students to deliver - culturally and linguistically appropriate care to underserved Hispanic patient populations in Houston and across Texas. In September, the college established an affiliation agreement with Vecino Health Centers, a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) with two clinics based in neighborhoods with predominately Hispanic/Spanish-speaking patient populations. The college also recently welcomed the appointment of Clinical Assistant Professor Nancy Chung, Pharm.D., BCACP, a 2011 UHCOP graduate and ambulatory care pharmacist with Spanish language proficiency and experience working with Hispanic/Latino patient populations through residency training in Austin and Orlando. Chung's practice site will be at Vecino's Denver Harbor Family Clinic east of downtown. Student experiential activities through the clinic are expected to Vecino Health Centers' Dr. Don Briscoe, medical director, and Daniel Montez, CEO, welcome UHCOP's Nancy Chung, Pharm.D., BCACP, to the Denver Harbor Family Clinic in east Houston. Matthew White/UH photo begin soon, with IPPE students coming on board in the spring 2014 semester and ambulatory care APPE students starting in the summer. The clinic is expected to serve as a preferred APPE site to provide abundant opportunities for students who've completed the Spanish for the Global Professions certificate program to practice their linguistic and cultural competencies. The affiliation also is expected to yield new pathways for interprofessional education, as Denver Harbor serves as the main longitudinal site for Houston Methodist Hospital's Family Medicine Residency Program and a rotation site for medical students/interns from area medical institutions. UHCOP students and faculty will also participate in health fairs, disease management, and preventative care programs alongside Vecino's medical staff, nurses, residents and students. \"The affiliation with Denver Harbor and the collaboration between practitioners and students in pharmacy and other health professions will present a unique learning and service opportunity to provide enhanced patient care for the community,\" Chung said. Chung is finalizing a formal application to the Texas State Board of Pharmacy for prescriptive authority under protocol of the Denver Harbor physicians for drug therapy management of diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia, as well as risk reduction of metabolic syndrome. \"Hypertension, diabetes and obesity are the most common disease states that we see, often in the same person,\" said Don Briscoe , M.D., Denver Harbor's medical director and chairman of the Family Medicine department/program director of the Family Medicine Residency at Houston Methodist Hospital. \"These patients often have multiple medications and don't understand how and why they are using them; the risks to their health from their conditions and from their treatments; and non-medical things that they can do to improve their health. \"We believe that pharmacists and students will have a big role in aiding these patients.\" 4 University of Houston College of PharmacyCUIDADOCUIDADOCUIDADO FARMAC\u00c9UTICOCUIDADOCUIDADOCUIDADO FARMAC\u00c9UTICO Even before UHCOP had established a formal affiliation with Vecino Health Centers, UH pharmacy students have been assisting the FQHC with community health fairs. Chip Lambert/UH photoAffiliation Introduces Pharmacist-led Care to Vecino FQHC Clinic in Denver Harbor AreaLow health literacy is a major risk factor in poor health outcomes across the U.S., and is associated with medication non-compliance, misdiagnosis, and increased emergency department utilization and inpatient admissions. According to the 2006 National Assessment of Adult Literacy report by National Center for Education Statistics, 41 percent of Hispanics scored at the \"below basic\" level in a health literacy performance assessment. With the support of a $6,000 UH New Faculty Research Program award, Chung has initiated a 12-month project to assess rates of low health literacy in Spanish-speaking patients at the Denver Harbor Family Clinic, to understand potential areas of interventions for low health literacy, and to assess potential healthcare consequences. The project will utilize pre-assessment survey and a validated health literacy assessment tool (Short Assessment of Health Literacy for Spanish Adults) to assess ability to read and understand common medical terms. The scores then will be compared against appointment data from the clinic's electronic medical records to assess whether low health literacy is associated with missed clinical appointments along with identification of demographic or societal factors that may influence low health literacy in the patient population. Project to Assess Health Literacy of Spanish-speaking PatientsProject to Assess Health Literacy of Spanish-speaking PatientsA cornerstone of the UH College of Pharmacy's Hispanic Healthcare Initiative is increasing the linguistic and cultural competencies of Pharm.D. students to enhance communication and ultimately improve health outcomes among Spanish-speaking patient populations. The program provides Pharm.D. students additional training in Spanish language and Hispanic culture through a certificate program through UH's Department of Hispanic Studies and placement in community and clinical experiential sites where a significant portion of the patient population has been identified as having limited English or exclusively Spanish language proficiency. Four students have both elements of the program, with another eight who have completed the first class. Pharm.D. candidate Habeeba Nizamdin said the program was invaluable on her ambulatory/primary care APPE at a Harris Health System clinic in south Houston. \"I used it (Spanish) so much, and it gave me an opportunity to have a lot of patient interaction, which I thrive on,\" Nizamdin said. \"I counseled in Spanish on asthma, especially proper use of inhalers; warfarin; diabetes; hypertension; and the importance of diet and exercise, which impacts so many disease states. It's amazing to see how patients open up, get more comfortable and share more, and we know that every detail from patients can be helpful for effective counseling and education.\" Although Pharm.D. candidate Chestley Miller grew up in a bilingual household, he said the certificate program and the daily practice on his APPEs helped expand and improve his \"medical Spanish\" vocabulary. \"I'm planning to return to the Mission/McAllen area and work in community pharmacy, so it's been beneficial to gain more familiarity in formal Spanish, especially in making medical presentations,\" he said. \"I think the preceptors and patients appreciated having others available to counsel and translate.\" Jose Dino, Pharm.D., pharmacist-in-charge at the Walgreens in northwest Houston where Miller and fellow program participant Martin Newtown did their advanced community APPE, said he was impressed by the students' skills. \"I told them directly, 'Your Spanish is better than mine,'\" said Dino, a native of Mexico. \"It's such a help to the patients to have someone who can use both technical and common terms to explain their medications.\"Spanish Certificate Students Put Skills, Knowledge into Practice at Experiential Sites Martin Newton, Habeeba Nizamdin and Chestley Miller were among the first pharmacy students to complete the Spanish for the Global Professions certificate program in UH's Department of Hispanic Studies.Chip Lambert/UH photo University of Houston College of Pharmacy 5 6 University of Houston College of PharmacyAt the Mading Society induction reception in October, UH College of Pharmacy honored R. Louis Rumsey, R.Ph. ('79), with the 2013 Alumnus Pharmacist of the Year Award and L. David Sparks, R.Ph., FACA, FIACP, with the 2013 Meritorious Service Award. Rumsey is owner and pharmacist-in-charge of the independent Elam Road Pharmacy in Dallas, and a member of the Dean's Advisory Council (DAC) at the college. \"Louis is a shining example of the importance of alumni engagement to help ensure a bright future for the College of Pharmacy,\" said UHCOP Dean F. Lamar Pritchard , Ph.D. \"His work as Chair of the DAC Advocacy Committee will pay dividends for the college for many years. Louis has worked collaboratively with DAC co-chairs Bruce Biundo and Carole Hardin-Oliver to establish a new standard in the area of quality leadership of the DAC.\" A newly inducted member of the college's Mading Society, Rumsey has been honored by the Texas Pharmacy Association as the 2009 TPA Pharmacist of the Year and by the TPA PharmPAC as the 2010 PharmPAC Person of the Year (the latter award now bears his name). \"I was very surprised and very honored to be named Alumnus of the Year by the college,\" Rumsey said. \"I have always appreciated the great education that I received at UH College of Pharmacy, which has allowed me to have a very fulfilling and honorable career. When someone asks me, 'What college did you go to?' I am always very proud to say, 'The University of Houston College of Pharmacy.' When someone asks me, 'What do you do?' I am always very proud to say, 'I am a pharmacist.' I am very blessed to be in a profession that helps people.\" The college also recognized PCCA's CEO L. David Sparks, an adjunct faculty member of the college, a member of its Mading Advocates Rumsey, Sparks Earn College's Gratitude for Service to Profession, College Society and a past member of the UHCOP DAC. Sparks is a Fellow of the American College of Apothecaries and the founding director of the International Academy of Compounding Pharmacists. He was named as one of the \"50 Most Influential People in Pharmacy\" by American Druggist in 1999; the Outstanding Alumnus by the Southwestern Pharmacy Alumni Foundation of Southwestern Oklahoma State University in 2000; and the John W. Dargavel Medal recipient by the National Community Pharmacists Association Foundation in 2006. \"This well-deserved recognition for one of pharmacy's true pioneers whose lifelong efforts have enhanced the quality of healthcare delivery worldwide,\" Pritchard said. \"We're very proud of Chairman Sparks and feel very fortunate that he has been a long-standing supporter of the college and pharmacy education.\" PCCA and UHCOP have been partners in pharmacy education for over a decade, with UH Pharm.D. students undergoing their required basic training in compounding as well as having the opportunity to take advanced compounding courses at PCCA's state-of-the-art facility in Sugar Land. Many UH alumni also have gone on to work at PCCA. Sparks also has been praised for his efforts at the state and national level to protect the practice of compounding pharmacy. \"I was very humbled by the honor, and I'm proud of having the opportunity to contribute in some small way to the education of the next generation of professional pharmacists,\" Sparks said. \"It's been a great experience working with these bright young minds and share in their enthusiasm, energy and interest in pharmacy. \"The great affiliation between PCCA and the college would not have been possible without the contributions of the entire team at PCCA and the administration and faculty at the college over the years.\" Sparks, PCCA President Jim Smith and Pritchard also acknowledged the major role of Sparks' late wife, Kay Sparks, R.Ph., FACA, FIACP, who passed in January 2012, in the success of PCCA and the education of UHCOP students since the couple joined the company in 1989.

David Sparks, who was introduced by PCCA President Jim Smith, far left, and joined by Sparks' son Bryan and daughter-in-law Bonnie.Jessie Villarreal/UH photos UH College of Pharmacy has initiated its transition to the Pharmacy Curriculum Outcomes Assessment (PCOA) exam and the Objectively Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE)/OSCE-like exams for the assessment of Pharm.D. students' skills and knowledge. The exams now are required for every UHCOP Pharm.D. student in the first, second and third year of the program as a formal assessment and embedded in courses within the curriculum. \"The combination of these two assessment tools will provide a more robust system by which the college can evaluate the knowledge, skills and application of our students as well as the effectiveness of our curriculum to provide these skills,\" said Elizabeth Coyle, Pharm.D., BCPS, FCCM, assistant dean of Assessment and clinical professor. \"Many OSCE-like assessments have traditionally been part of our courses, such as patient counseling and Therapeutics case exam. We will now utilize the students' performance in these practical exams in conjunction with performance on the PCOA.\" The comprehensive PCOA exam was administered in January 2014 to the P1-P3 classes by representatives of the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, which developed the 220-question exam covering basic biomedical sciences; pharmaceutical sciences; social, behavioral and administrative sciences; and clinical sciences. Adopted by the UHCOP faculty last May, the PCOA replaces the in-house \"Milemarker\" tool used by the college for nearly a decade to determine and assess knowledge and progression readiness. With the benefits of greater standardization of exam questions and more accurate benchmarking to national data, the PCOA assessment is formative in the P1 and P2 years, and summative for the P3s. Minimum competency must be met for the P3 students to progress to APPEs. Developed in the 1970s, the OSCE is part of the licensing requirements to practice medicine in the U.S. and both medicine and pharmacy in Canada. According to a 2010 survey article in the American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education, only 11 out of 88 College Implements Mandatory PCOA, OSCEs for Assessment Coyleresponding pharmacy programs consistently held multi-station OSCEs using standardized patients. However, interest in such programs in pharmacy academia has been on the rise nationwide. The OSCEs and OSCE-like exams throughout the curriculum evaluate student knowledge in scenarios that highlight their skills and abilities in a practical setting, such as patient counseling, resolving prescription fill issues, physical assessment, case workup and presentation, IV admixture, errors and omissions, and interprofessional practice. The summative OSCE for P3 students will be administered in April 2014. Subscribe to Interactions Refill for college news delivered to your computer or mobile device.

UHCOP graduates taking the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination (NAPLEX) and the Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Examination (MPJE) for the first time in the May 1-Aug. 31, 2013, testing period achieved a 100 percent pass rate on both exams. The results were released by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy. The \"perfect performance\" by UHCOP graduates exceeds the national and statewide averages for the two exams in the same testing period. \"On behalf of the entire college, I extend our sincere congratulations and appreciation to the May 2013 class,\" said Dean Lamar Pritchard , Ph.D. \"It's a true testament to our new graduates' commitment to the profession and providing the best possible care to their patients, as well as the commitment of our faculty, staff and preceptors to excellence in pharmacy education.\"100% of UH Graduates Pass Licensure Exams on First Try During May-August Period University of Houston College of Pharmacy 7UH College of Pharmacy and interprofessional education partners Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and Texas Woman's University (TWU) are expanding their efforts to develop and evaluate how pharmacy, medical and nursing students can improve their communication techniques and enhance understanding of the role each team member plays in patient safety. The college began collaborating with each institution on separate interprofessional education (IPE) projects over three years ago, with UHCOP-TWU students working side-by-side on high-fidelity simulated patient mannequins and UHCOP-BCM students conducting in-home medical check-ups with predominately home-bound patients across the Houston area. Over the past year, the three institutions have coordinated their efforts by integrating their respective pharmacy, nursing and medical students into healthcare team-based projects. The core competencies for interprofessional collaborative practice developed by the Interprofessional Education Collaborative (IPEC), which comprises the primary academic associations for the major health professions in the U.S., serve as guiding principles for the UH, BCM and TWU effort. \"Interprofessional care models are the future of healthcare delivery,\" said Elizabeth Nelson , M.D., senior associate dean for Medical Education and primary investigator on a National Institutes of Health grant focused on IPE. \"Understanding the skills and goals of each component of the healthcare system allows us to provide the best patient-centered care possible. \"Innovative, efficient outcomes-based care focused on the patient should be everyone's goal. In the best world, our unique skills create synergies, not silos.\" UHCOP's IPE initiatives have been spearheaded by Catherine Hatfield , Pharm.D., clinical associate professor and director of Communication, Patient Safety at Core of Expanded Programs in Interprofessional Education Institutional Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experiences. \"We've collectively decided to focus our initial efforts on improving communication and eliminating or at least reducing communication errors,\" Hatfield said. \"More Americans die from medical errors than breast cancer, AIDS or car accidents, and The Joint Commission has reported that miscommunication is among the leading causes of serious medical errors.\" The latest projects emphasize communication among pharmacy, medical and nursing students through a case-presentation/recommendation exercise and a patient safety role-playing scenario related to a medication error using a standardized patient. With the goal of identifying further IPE opportunities, Hatfield and Nelson have been appointed as an ex-officio member of the curriculum committee at each other's institution. \"The collaboration to-date has been fantastic, and the future is only limited by learning more about each other's institutions,\" Nelson said. \"Representation on each other's committees will allow us to think creatively about natural educational touchpoints and where we might create new opportunities.\" UH Pharm.D. student Bobby Clay, center, and Baylor College of Medicine medical student Richard Auzenne (UH Biology '10), left, and Texas Woman's University nursing student Mary Moon explain their respective roles in a medication error as part of a role-playing scenario with a standardized patient.Chip Lambert/UH photo Stay ConnectedStay Connected https://www.facebook.com/UHCOP http://www.linkedin.com/groups/University- University of Houston College of PharmacyAlexis Bertsch, Research Administrator Lupita Rangel Curiel, Program Coordinator 2Ty Hall , Secretary 2 Barbara Knight, Development Coordinator 1Miranda McMorris, Financial Analyst 2Sheree Pearce , College Information Turner, Zamora-Loa, Executive SecretaryStaff AppointmentsStaff AppointmentsUH College of Pharmacy's Department of Clinical Sciences and Administration has welcomed two additions - Nancy Chung, Pharm.D., BCACP, and Nicholas Beyda, Pharm.D., BCPS - to its faculty ranks. Chung joined the college as a clinical assistant professor of ambulatory care. Her clinical site is at the Denver Harbor Family Clinic, a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) in east Houston operated by Vecino Health Centers (see story on page 4). After receiving her Pharm.D. from UHCOP in 2011, Chung completed a PGY1 residency at Florida Hospital Celebration Health in Orlando, Fla., and a PGY2 ambulatory care specialty residency at Blackstock Family Practice, CommUnityCare and The University of Texas in Austin. During her residency training, she received teaching certificates from the University of Florida and UT-Austin. Board certified in ambulatory care, Chung's research and practice interests include outcomes research in diabetes, metabolic syndrome, hypertension and indigent care. Beyda has joined the college as a Research Assistant Professor after completing the two- year Infectious Diseases Pharmacy Fellowship at UHCOP and St. Luke's Health System, where he continues to have a clinical/research affiliation. Before entering the fellowship program, Beyda completed a PGY-1 residency at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center in Shreveport. Beyda earned his Pharm.D. from the Harrison School of Pharmacy at Auburn. Beyda's research interests include antifungal pharmacokinetics/ pharmacodynamics and mechanisms of resistance; host immune response to Candida species; and rapid diagnostics for bloodstream infections.Ambulatory Care, Infectious Disease Specialists Join College Ranks Beyda ChungRural Liberty County northeast of Houston has the unenviable distinction of being among the Texas counties with the highest number of hospitalizations for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). According a 2010 report by the Texas Health Care Information Council based on 2005 data, there were 15,424 hospitalizations for asthma and 26,718 hospitalizations for COPD in adult Texans and Liberty County was among the top 10 counties for COPD admission rates. In response, a pharmacist-led education and adherence project based at a Walgreens in the Liberty County city of Cleveland has been launched to help patients with uncontrolled asthma/COPD manage their conditions. The project team comprises Walgreens/UHCOP PGY1 Community Pharmacy resident Tompkins, Pharm.D. The team also is working with the Health Center of Southeast Texas, a Federally Qualified Health Center in Cleveland, for referrals and follow-ups. Yen Phan, Pharm.D. ('12), a Walgreens pharmacy manager in Houston, conducted the background research and literature reviews for the project design while serving as the inaugural Walgreens/UHCOP community resident. Hardin-Oliver said she was spurred to act after reading a 2011 Houston Chronicle article about the high rate of asthma Walgreens Residency Project Targets Uncontrolled COPD/Asthma hospitalizations in the county which falls within her district. \"I took it very personally,\" Hardin-Oliver said. \"We have the ability to impact public health in a significant way, and I think this is something we can expand to other areas. People are starting to grasp how education and counseling by pharmacists can bring about real improvements in health outcomes.\" The residency program recently received a 2014 American Pharmacists Association Foundation Incentive Grants for Practitioner Innovation in Pharmaceutical Care award to reduce costs for patients. Participants may be eligible for such incentives as free spacers and nebulizers when prescribed by physicians, as well as peak-flow meters for asthma patients and co-pay assistance for pulmonary function testing for COPD patients. \"A primary reason for non-adherence is the patient's confusion or misunderstanding of which inhaler to use when and the proper technique to ensure they receive the appropriate amount,\" Bhatt said. A veteran of disease state management programs (including asthma and diabetes), Masilamani said the community setting has an advantage over ambulatory care clinics where similar pharmacist-led programs have a well-established track record of effectiveness in improving health outcomes. \"In clinics, you always hit a wall of being able to work with 150-200 patients per year, but community pharmacists see patients every day, so it's a perfect opportunity to implement clinical pharmacy services to a larger patient population,\" she said. \u00a9Backyard Productions/Stockfresh FACULTY NEWS University of Houston College of Pharmacy 9Rajender R.

The disruption of renal natriuretic receptors could cause sodium imbalance and development of hypertension, which affects more than 70 million Americans and is a major risk factor for stroke, heart failure and other renal and cardiovascular diseases. Professor Mustafa F. Lokhandwala, Ph.D., and Research Assistant Professor Anees A. Banday, Ph.D., are examining the role of a specific protein in activating anti-oxidant genes to protect renal/kidney dopamine receptors from oxidative damage and in turn allow renal hormone dopamine to maintain sodium homeostasis. The protein, called Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 or simply redox-sensitive transcription factor NRf2, controls the flow of genetic information from DNA to mRNA by binding to specific DNA sequences. Supported by a four-year, $1.3 million National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) grant awarded in September, the research conducted by Lokhandwala and Banday could offer novel insight into the mechanism as it relates to an antioxidant-based therapeutic approach to such chronic diseases as hypertension. Kidneys play a pivotal role in regulating blood volume, sodium balance, pH and blood pressure, and dopamine via activation of renal dopamine receptors is an important factor that works to control sodium balance and subsequently maintains normal blood pressure, Lokhandwala said. \"Any dysfunction in the renal dopamine mechanism would lead to excessive sodium reabsorption, volume expansion and ultimately hypertension,\" Lokhandwala said. \"There are various factors that play a role in causing an increase in blood pressure, one of which is oxidative stress. \"When you increase levels of reactive oxygen species - or free radicals - in the body, and specifically in the kidney, they cause damage to the functioning of hormonal systems in such a way that you are predisposed to development of hypertension and other disorders.\" Oxidative stress causes a dysfunction of renal dopamine receptor function, such that during elevated levels of reactive oxidative species, dopamine is unable to promote sodium excretion because its receptor function is not functioning properly. This leads to sodium retention and hypertension. \"What we've discovered is when you elevate levels of reactive oxidative species, there are various changes that take place when this happens,\" Lokhandwala said. \"There are various endogenous factors that come in to fight the reactive oxidative species, including the endogenous antioxidant enzymes that get activated to reduce the oxidative stress. Certain transcription factors lead to the formation of these antioxidant enzymes in the body, including the kidney.\" The investigators are conducting experiments using the plant- derived polyphenol resveratrol, a constituent of red wine and a variety of foods, which is among compounds believed to play a major role in the sequence of activities which ultimately results in reducing blood pressure. \"We've found that in transgenic mice resveratrol can lower oxidative stress by activating the transcription factor NRf2, restore renal dopamine receptor function and decrease blood pressure,\" Lokhandwala said. The results of their research could have significant implications not only in the understanding and treatment of hypertension, but on countless other disease states in which oxidative stress is believed to have a role. \"Oxidative stress is present in many disease states, so you can take these compounds to be beneficial for other disease states, such as neurological disorders, cancer and diabetes,\" Banday said. \"Fruits and vegetables are natural sources of anti-oxidant compounds and can be taken over a long time without negative effects, which is always something that has to be taken into account with drugs. Most drugs right now address the symptoms, but we're trying to find the mechanism. In cardiovascular medicine, if you fix one thing, it has profound benefits on other things.\" The investigators' recent work has published in the journals Hypertension and the American Journal of Physiology: Renal Physiology . Professor Mustafa Lokhandwala and Research Assistant Professor Anees Banday are studying how activation of anti-oxidant genes protects renal/kidney dopamine receptors from oxidative damage and in turn averts the development of hypertension.

Shah, Pharm.D. ('08), clinical assistant professor, are pursuing several industry-sponsored projects to address Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Clostridium difficle (C.diff.) is the leading cause of infectious diarrhea in the health system environment - linked to 14,000 American deaths each year - and seen as an emerging threat in the community setting. On the forefront of the fight against CDI, Garey and Shah have received support for four new projects totaling more than $400,000 from Merck & Co., Cubist Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Summit Corporation LLC. Their collaborative projects range from the evaluation of potential new antimicrobial agents and characterization of microbial factors for CDI recurrence to the development of a novel system to quantify CDI's effect on patient quality of life. For two of the projects, Garey and Shah are performing analyses on investigational drugs - identified by the sponsors as CB-183,315 and SMT19969 - as potential novel antimicrobial agents for C.diff. associated diarrhea (CDAD). The third project is a clinical epidemiological study to identify the pathobiologic characteristics of C.diff. strains that increase a patient's risk for CDI recurrence. As part of an ongoing surveillance project, the researchers previously isolated 30 primary/recurrent CDI strain pairs - believed to be one of the world's largest collections - from hundreds of stool samples obtained at a Houston hospital. Using state-of-the-art epidemiology and microbiology techniques, this study will evaluate virulence factors in an effort to determine what microbial factors increase a patient's likelihood for CDI recurrence. In the fourth project, Garey and Shah are working to develop and validate a novel instrument to measure the impact of CDI on a patient's health-related quality of life (HRQOL). According to the CDC, HRQOL is related to both self-reported chronic diseases and their risk factors. Interpretation and publication of HRQOL data can help identify needs for health policies and legislation, allocate resources based on unmet needs, guide the development of strategic plans, and monitor the effectiveness of community interventions. The UHCOP team believes that the new instrument will be invaluable in assessing HRQOL of patients enrolled in interventional studies to prevent recurrent CDI. Garey, Shah Use Multiple Strategies in Fight Against C.diff. Infection Garey Shah 12 University of Houston College of PharmacyUH College of Pharmacy is playing a unique role in clinical trials of a drug as a potential neuroprotective agent to prevent or limit nerve damage in acute spinal cord injuries (SCI) resulting from trauma, most commonly from falls and car accidents. Representing the only college of pharmacy within the North American Clinical Trial Network (NACTN), UHCOP Professor Diana S-L. Chow, Ph.D., is spearheading the clinical pharmacokinetic analyses for the NACTN-led investigation of the drug Riluzole in acute SCI patients. Established in 2004 by the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation, which was named in honor of late actor Christopher Reeve and his late wife, the NACTN comprises 10 clinical sites, a data management center and a pharmacology center (UHCOP). Best known for his portrayal of the iconic \"Superman\" in four films, Christopher Reeve was paralyzed after sustaining a spinal cord injury in a horseback-riding accident. Riluzole is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a progressive neurodegenerative disease also known as \"Lou Gehrig's disease.\" In ALS patients, the degeneration and death of motor neurons reduces the ability of the spinal cord to initiate and control muscle movement, often leading to total paralysis. Although there is no treatment to stop or reverse ALS, Riluzole is the only drug approved by the FDA to slow its progression. Riluzole has multiple mechanisms of action, including blockage of sodium channels in neurons and glia and reduction of glutamatergic excitoxicity. In numerous preclinical studies, the drug also has been shown to be neuroprotective in animal models of spinal cord injury. The Phase I safety and pharmacological study of Riluzole was funded from the Reeve Foundation, U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), Mission Connect (a project of the TIRR Foundation) and AOSpine North America Inc. It was initiated in 2010 and concluded with the enrollment of the 36th patient in 2011, with follow-up of the patients during the subsequent years. Last year, the DOD provided an additional $2 million to support the next phase of the studies. Chow's ongoing NACTN role is to conduct pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analyses of the plasma Riluzole concentrations of the study patients. Robert G. Grossman, M.D., professor of Neurosurgery at Houston Methodist Hospital and principal investigator for NACTN, said the PK/PD analyses is UH Plays Key Role in Clinical Trials for Acute Spinal Cord Injury an essential component of the project. \"NACTN is very fortunate to have Dr. Chow's expertise in clinical pharmacology, population pharmacokinetics and drug metabolic clearance,\" Grossman said. \"It was very important to have a pharmacological component to the investigation, which is a unique contribution of the Riluzole trial to the field of SCI research. \"In prior SCI clinical trials of various drugs, the investigators didn't know the systemic exposure to the drug or the metabolism of the drug. Therefore, this trial was an innovation in spinal cord injury clinical research.\" The phase I clinical trial indicated that the use of Riluzole was safe and resulted in an improvement in motor function of patients. An important finding was the documentation of the significant intersubject variability of Riluzole concentrations in the blood among the acute SCI patients. \"There was an almost 20-fold difference between the achieved lowest and highest concentrations in different patients\" Chow said. \"Most drugs reach a steady state in 4-5 biological half-lives, which is 24-48 hours post-dose for Riluzole. However, in SCI, the patient's physiology is changing rapidly as the body responds to the injury, and the distribution as well as the metabolism of the drug change. \"As a result, we observed the highest concentrations in the blood initially, but it decreased as days went by, although the daily dose remained the same. This points to the importance of measuring and monitoring drug levels to be certain that you have an effective dose in the patient, and that is a major goal of the Phase 2 trial.\" Grossman said the differences in metabolism/absorption among patients may require an individualized approach. \"To obtain the most effective therapeutic level of drug for each patient, it may be necessary to adjust the dosage according to the blood level the way you do with antibiotics or anticonvulsants to be sure you get an effective dose,\" he said. Results of the initial work by the Houston team and fellow NACTN members have been published in the Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine and the Journal of Neurotrauma as well as presented at conferences of the American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists, the American College of Clinical Pharmacology, the National Neurotrauma Society and the Society for Neuroscience. UHCOP's Diana Chow, center, and Methodist Hospital's Robert Grossman, M.D., professor of Neurosurgery, and Elizabeth Toups, RN, M.S., CCRP, clinical trials manager, are investigating the efficacy of the drug Riluzole as a novel neuroprotective therapeutic agent for acute spinal cord injury.

STUDENT NEWS NCPA, SNPhA Chapters Continue to Rank Among Nation's Elite Two of UH College of Pharmacy's largest student organizations - the Student National Pharmaceutical Association (SNPhA) and the National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA) - have propelled their chapters into ranks of the nation's elite. UH's SNPhA chapter finished fourth in the nation and second in the region, as well as in the top 3 among \"large\" chapters, at the SNPhA Annual Conference in New Orleans. The chapter also received the 2013 National Convention Registration Award among the \"large\" chapters, with 36 attendees from UH. \"The success of our chapter is due to the passion that is instilled in its members; as a chapter, we are committed to our profession, the underserved community, and fulfilling our duties,\" said the chapter's 2012-13 president Ashley Tran, who was one of seven nationwide finalists for the J.B. Hills SNPhA President of the Year Award. In addition, members Diana Garcia and Patrick Maranon were elected to national offices of National Corresponding Secretary and Region IV Facilitator, respectively. Garcia served in the latter position during 2012-13. Michael \"Danny\" Jean, who completed his term as National Vice President at the conference, was appointed to the new national position of Head of Interprofessional Affairs. Class of 2017 P1 students David Pham and Tracey Thomas were selected at attend the Rite Aid Leadership Academy. The UH chapter of the National Community Pharmacists Association took home its second consecutive First Runner-up finish for the Chapter of the Year competition at the NCPA's 115th Annual Convention & Trade Exposition Oct. 12-16 in Orlando. The chapter award, which includes $1,000 in support, and outstanding member award are presented by the NCPA Foundation with support from McKesson. In addition to the chapter honors, member Esther Thomas was among 32 students recognized as the NCPA Student Chapter Outstanding Members of the Year. The UHCOP chapter has undergone a major resurgence in recent years, including having three consecutive students elected to two- year terms on the Student National Leadership Council (one of whom was elected National SLC President). \"Being named first runner-up two years in a row is a huge accomplishment for us,\" said current Chapter President Ally Thrall. \"It goes to show how involved our students are, and it definitely feels good to be recognized for our hard work. In my opinion, independent pharmacy is the life of pharmacy. I think UH students are passionate about all of the different opportunities within pharmacy and are interested in learning about all of the different options they have in the future.\" Tam Nguyen, Thrall's predecessor, said the chapter owes much of the credit for its success to the support from faculty co-advisors Lynn Simpson and Catherine Hatfield as well as independent pharmacy advocates such as Bruce Biundo. \"The chapter's ranking is a direct reflection of the strong work ethic in our membership and support from our independent pharmacists,\" Nguyen said. \"Our ranking helps build momentum and excitement for the new school year, especially for our new officers and incoming P1 students. Being ranked First Runner- up two years in a row is a validation that we got it 'right' here at UHCOP.\" UH NCPA Chapter co-advisor Lynn Simpson, Chapter President Ally Thrall, Chapter Vice President Katie Shake Williams, National Student Leadership Council Member and past UH Chapter President Bobby Clay, and NCPA Associate Director of Management and Student Affairs Whitney Cowart show off the chapter's First Runner-up certificate at the national convention.

Clinic providing basic primary health care to Houston's homeless population for more than a decade. The Houston Outreach Medicine, Education and Social Services (H.O.M.E.S.) Clinic in downtown Houston is a collaboration between UHCOP students and volunteer faculty and medical students and faculty from Baylor College of Medicine and The University of Texas Health Science Center (UTHealth). Over the past year, H.O.M.E.S. has received recognition from the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP) and the Texas Medical Association (TMA) to expand and enhance essential healthcare services for Houston's homeless population. The clinic operates under the auspices of the nonprofit Healthcare for the Homeless- Houston (HHH), which was founded by BCM physician Dr. David Buck. H.O.M.E.S. MODEL H.O.M.E.S. photos by Chip Lambert/layout by Georgina Mondshine UH College of Pharmacy's collaboration with Baylor College of Medicine and UT Health Science Center to provide primary care for Houston's homeless population is opening eyes at the state and national level. 16 University of Houston College of Pharmacyis open every Sunday to ensure access to needed services on a day when most other healthcare providers are closed while also reducing the use of hospital emergency rooms for non-life-threatening conditions. More than 3,000 patients have been served through the clinic since its launch in 2000. In 2013, H.O.M.E.S. was recognized by the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy as one of four recipients of the Student Community-Engaged Service Award and grant monies totaling $16,000. H.O.M.E.S. also was recently honored with the 2014 John P. McGovern Champion of Health Award from the TMA Foundation, which includes a $5,000 grant that the clinic's leadership team plans to use for expanding immunization outreach, purchase new diagnostic and other equipment and educate students about caring for the homeless. The UHCOP H.O.M.E.S. team also has worked with Walgreens to offer free seasonal flu immunizations to clinic patients, with UH pharmacy students providing immunizations to more than 200 homeless individuals at H.O.M.E.S. or affiliated service centers since fall 2012. \"I'm elated that the HOMES Clinic team is being acknowledged for serving the homeless community for more than a decade,\" said Kim Anh Pham, who is serving as the clinic's first executive director from UHCOP. \"Being a part of HOMES Clinic has not only helped me in deciding what I want to do in my pharmacy career, but it also gave me insight to the needs of the homeless population. \"I've gained a deeper understanding of how homelessness could happen to any of us as a result of life-changing events or circumstances that are often beyond a person's control.\" Opposite top, UH Pharm.D. student Yuanli Li counsels a H.O.M.E.S. patient on his medication as BCM medical students Gregory Low and Meredith Wise complete their notes.

Clinic Executive Director Pham said the AACP grant monies primarily will be used to restock and expand the on-site pharmacy's supply of common medications, including inhalers for asthma and other lung conditions, antibiotics, vaccines and psychiatric drugs. Pham's fellow student contributors on the grant submission included Henrietta D. Abodakpi, Habeeba Nizamdin and Bobbie Quach as well as UHCOP Clinical Associate Professor David A. Wallace, Pharm.D. ('98). UHCOP's Wallace has been a fixture at HOMES almost every Sunday since the clinic opened, serving as faculty advisor, preceptor and clinical pharmacist. \"It's very rewarding to see the students grow not only in their technical and clinical knowledge and skills, but also in their empathy and awareness of the complex medical, mental health and social needs within this patient population,\" he said. In addition to the student volunteers, the continued success of the clinic's operation is due to the efforts of Wallace and the attending physicians who volunteer their time: Dr. Thomas Lin, Dr. Dana Clark, Dr. Meena Eswaran, and clinic/HHH founder Buck. \"It has been thrilling to see HOMES Clinic and HHH serve as the launching point for Edward Fox Photography/courtesy of AACPcontinued next page University of Houston College of Pharmacy 17In an effort to learn more about the challenges and success stories of providing health care for the homeless population, two UH College of Pharmacy Pharm.D. students attended the three-day Street Medicine Institute's 9th Annual International Street Medicine Symposium in Boston. UH students Haruna Kato and Kim Anh Pham, who serves as the executive director of the Houston Outreach Medicine, Education and Social Services (HOMES) Clinic, learned from numerous leaders and practitioners in the field of \"street medicine\" and visited several homeless shelters and healthcare service centers. According to the institute, \"Street medicine is the provision of medical care directly to those living and sleeping on the streets through mobile services such as walking teams, medical vans and outdoor clinics. Street Medicine is the first essential step in achieving higher levels of care through assertive, coordinated and collaborative medical management.\" \"I met with student leaders from across the country, and had a great time in exchanging ideas and sharing stories,\" Pham said. \"I am ecstatic to be a part of a growing movement in collaborative care for the homeless population.\" In a separate but related project, Pharm.D./Pharmaceutics doctoral student Henrietta Abodakpi also helped spread the word about street medicine through integration of three sessions of UTHealth's \"Street Medicine Lecture Series\" into the UHCOP Pharm.D. convocations. Streamed live from the UTHealth campus to UHCOP's main and TMC campuses, the lectures featured the testimonial of a former homeless individual as well as insights from service providers. \"One's concept of a homeless individual can be very one dimensional from the outside, so I think the lecture series gave pharmacy students a different perspective on homelessness,\" said Abodakpi , who serves as the H.O.M.E.S. Clinic senior chair at UHCOP. \"Although part of our training is to be objective and separate our emotions and personal beliefs from the patient, I believe being able to empathize with your patients prompts you to provide the best care.\"Street Medicine Students gain deeper awareness of healthcare delivery in homeless population H.O.M.E.S. continued from p. 17 UH pharmacy students Mai Nguyen and Heidi Day provide free seasonal flu immunizations at the Way Station at Palmer Memorial Episcopal Church in November as part of a collaboration of Walgreens and H.O.M.E.S.

Houston's budding health professionals and as they go into practice continuing this work, emerge as leaders within a healthcare arena where it is sorely needed, and make this their career,\" Buck said. One of the unique strengths of the clinic is its connection to the patient electronic medical records (EMR) of Harris Health System, where many H.O.M.E.S. patients have sought medical care at some point. Access to the Harris Health EMR by authorized members of the clinical team presents a unique opportunity to provide a continuum of care in a patient population for which stable housing and other issues may pose obstacles to routine or regular health care. UHCOP Dean F. Lamar Pritchard , Ph.D., said H.O.M.E.S. is a prime example of the impact of interprofessional teams in delivering basic health services to the underserved through collaborative education and practice models. \"One of the most critical healthcare challenges we face nationwide is poor medication adherence, with an estimated total annual cost upward of $300 billion due to increased hospitalizations and other factors,\" Pritchard said. \"The HOMES Clinic and safety net providers such as HHH play a vital role in receiving basic health care when few other options are available and preventing potentially serious complications resulting from interruptions in their drug therapies.\" Buck said he hopes the experience of working in collaboration will stay with the medical and pharmacy students throughout their careers. \"Part of what we need to change (in health care) is the 'silo' mentality,\" Buck said. \"One of the more inspiring pieces of the clinic is how we and the students get to learn from each other and work together to utilize the different skills that each profession brings to the table.\" 18 University of Houston College of PharmacyUH College of Pharmacy and Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center have established an unconventional experiential program to give fourth year Pharm.D. students an immersive introduction to life in health- system pharmacy residencies and practice. Students in the Longitudinal Clinical Experiential Program commit to completing four of the five required Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences at Memorial Hermann. Piloted with four students in the 2012-13 academic year, the program has expanded to five students in the current academic year. Brian Gulbis , Pharm.D., BCPS, clinical specialist in Cardiovascular Surgery and PGY1 residency program director at the hospital, said the Memorial Hermann LCEP was modeled on a similar program at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit for Wayne State University pharmacy students. \"This program allows the students to be more competitive for residencies, which have become more difficult in finding a match because the applicants far exceed the number of slots available,\" he said. \"We're able to do more activities with highly motivated students, instead of retraining every six weeks with new students, while also enhancing patient care.\" LCEP students are expected to engage in many resident-level activities, including journal clubs and completing a full-fledged research project with IRB approval, data collection and analysis to be presented at state or national meetings. Students in the program also assist with discharge counseling of patients to ensure continuity of care. \"As preceptors, getting this quality of student makes it fun to teach,\" said Jennifer Gass, Pharm.D., M.S., BCPS, Cardiology ICU clinical specialist and LCEP coordinator at Memorial Hermann. \"It creates a very symbiotic and motivating experience for everyone.\" Student Sean Garcia said the journal clubs and case presentations were the most challenging aspect of the LCEP. \"It takes a lot of preparation to become knowledgeable and confident about your topic, which tests your time-management skills throughout the rotation,\" Garcia said. \"We do about 90 percent of what the residents do, and although it is challenging at times, I learn a lot at the end of the day.\" While the program limits the variety of institutions and operational differences to which students are exposed, LCEP students and their preceptors believe the benefits outweigh any missed opportunities for networking and career development. \"In reality, when you consider the number of preceptors they interact with at our institution, we have a lot of contacts ourselves,\" Gulbis said. \"You also have to take into account the depth of those interactions, as opposed to the more limited assessment that typically can be provided from one rotation.\" LCEP student Stephanie Bowman said the LCEP program reinforced her decision to pursue post-graduate residencies. \"I love my clinical responsibilities and ability to provide direct patient care, and I think the variety of activities are preparing me to be an above-average resident next year,\" Bowman said.

Albert Schweitzer Fellow, Paul Ambrose Scholar Jag Maturi is committed to helping others, but sometimes the only way to tell his service focus on a given day may boil down to what he's wearing: He is a licensed real estate consultant, certified peace officer/reserve deputy constable, professional model and third-year student in the Pharm.D. program. Maturi has earned the distinction of being the first UH pharmacy student selected for the 2013-14 Houston-Galveston Schweitzer Fellows Program, the local arm of the international organization created in honor of renowned physician- humanitarian-Nobel Laureate Albert Schweitzer. Slated to graduate as a \"Schweitzer Fellow for Life\" in April 2014, Maturi has spent the past year volunteering at least two Saturdays every month at the nonprofit Indian Doctors Charity Clinic in southwest Houston. Maturi assisted the clinic's physicians with therapeutic recommendations for about 400 patients, including suggesting appropriate lower-cost generic alternatives. \"It was a great opportunity to learn a lot about patient diagnosis and what goes into operating a nonprofit community outpatient clinic,\" Maturi said. He also is the latest UHCOP student selected for the Paul Ambrose Scholars Program, a collaborative initiative between the Association for Prevention Teaching and Research (APTR) and the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Named in memory of a public health advocate who perished in the 9-11 terror attacks, the program aims to foster the next generation of leaders to address the public health challenges identified in the national Healthy People 2020 initiative.The program brings together students and practitioners across a range of health-related disciplines for a three-day symposium in Washington, D.C., as well as an extensive network of mentors and connections in the public health field. U.S. Public Health Service Pharm.D. candidate Martin Newton is one of only four pharmacy students - and only 17 students across six health-related disciplines nationwide - selected for a unique \"early commissioning\" program offered through the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS). Students selected for the competitive Senior Commissioned Officer Senior Training and Externship Program (SRCOSTEP) become Commissioned officers and receive full pay and benefits of an active duty officer for up to 12 months while finishing their education. In return, program participants agree to work for the USPHS-sponsoring agency as a Commissioned Corps officer immediately after graduation for a period equal to twice the sponsored time. Newton will be assigned to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. \"Having grown up with my father in PHS allowed me some familiarity with the service and what I would be doing,\" Newton said. \"I was also able to meet many healthcare professionals in the PHS, which gave me a great understanding of what life and a career in the service are like.\" NCPA National Office For his Legal & Regulatory Affairs experiential rotation last summer, Pharm.D. candidate David Young received an insider's view of the National Community Pharmacists Association's advocacy and outreach activities at the organization's national headquarters in Alexandria, Va. A member of NCPA throughout his Pharm.D. education, Young said the experience provided him with an abundance of knowledge and contacts to help him toward his goal of having his own pharmacy. During the six-week rotation, Young wrote articles for the association's magazine and student e-newsletter, helped organize an ownership workshop, made an in-house presentation on niche services, and attended Senate conference meetings and seminars on health exchanges. \"I also did a lot of work on health exchanges to give members the tools they need for the roll-out and be able to help customers with issues related to the exchanges,\" Young said. \"I was fortunate to get an up-close look at what's working and what's struggling in the independent setting. It was the best rotation you could do to learn about independent pharmacy and the importance of advocacy.\" Pharm.D. candidate Martin Newton is one of only four pharmacy students nationwide selected for a competitive program of the U.S. Public Health Service.Joe Gayle/UH photo In April, Pharm.D. student Jag Maturi will be the first UHCOP student to earn the distinction of Schweitzer Fellow for Life from The Albert Schweitzer Fellowship's Houston-Galveston Chapter. Aaron Nelson/UH photoSummer Observership Program at Methodist Offers Preview of Health-system Options, Roles A team of clinical pharmacists at Houston Methodist Hospital - several of whom are UH College of Pharmacy alumni - is providing Pharm.D. students with an inside look at the diverse roles and opportunities in health-system pharmacy before they begin the experiential portion of their education. Students observe pharmacy staff in various pharmacy locations and learn about the roles of residents and pharmacists in clinical, operational, management, informatics and medication safety. The observers are introduced to a range of practice and operational/management activities through rounding and attending meetings and presentations/journal clubs as well as engage in quality and process improvement projects. \"Even when I was in school, I knew I wanted to do a residency but I wasn't sure where to start,\" said cardiology clinical specialist Kimberly A. Nguyen, Pharm.D. ('02), who led the initiative with the support of committee members Linda Blanton, R.Ph. ('74); Sara Hart, Pharm.D., (B.S. '74). \"Certain functions and roles may not be covered until later in your education, so the observership gives a broad exposure to hospital pharmacy,\" Nguyen said. \"Not only do you get a preview of what to expect in your experientials and career, but it's a way to jump-start your professional development and potentially have an edge when pursuing residencies.\" Although not directly connected to UHCOP, the program has hosted a UH pharmacy student every year since its inception in 2010. Andrew Mulder, the most recent observer from UHCOP, said he was inspired to see how the pharmacists make decisions to positively impact patient care every day. \"I hadn't expected how much the clinical pharmacists collaborate and support each other (and) how they work as a team with physicians, nurses and other healthcare professionals,\" Mulder said. \"I was surprised that we weren't just doing simple paperwork, but working on significant projects that we were able to present at multiple meetings.\" An article on the program was published in the American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy in November 2012. Above, students Andrew Mulder (UH) and Sara Qureshi (UT), center, are pictured with current Observership committee members Kathryn Pidcock; Beverly Lukawski, Pharm.D.; Sara Hart; Kimberly Nguyen; and Linda Blanton (committee member Earl Sampson is not pictured).

Nets National Kappa Epsilon Award The UH Upsilon chapter of the Kappa Epsilon Professional Pharmacy Fraternity was awarded the Outstanding New Member Recruitment Award at the national organization's 49th Annual Convention in Richmond, Va. The local chapter was recognized for dramatically reversing a downward trend in membership over recent years due to graduations and other factors. Chapter leaders initiated several recruitment projects, including producing a recruitment video and extensively promoting the chapter's Silk Rose Jubilee event for breast cancer awareness, that resulted in a 500 percent jump in membership in a year. photo courtesy of Kappa Epsilon/Upsilon Chapter Officers and members of the Kappa Epsilon pharmacy fraternity's Upsilon Chapter display the Outstanding New Member Recruitment Award they received at the national organization's annual convention.

Class of 2015 President and a Dean's Advisory Council student representative, rarely passes up an opportunity to improve his knowledge and skills. Ohonba welcomed his nomination and selection to participate in Cardinal Health's annual Student Leadership Conference, which provides a forum for the future leaders of pharmacy to develop their skills while interacting with their peers from more than 25 colleges of pharmacy across the country. More than 150 students, including several from UHCOP, have benefited from the conference over the years. The students spend three days at Cardinal's corporate offices in Houston, listening to presentations from leaders of the profession and engaging in a variety of exercises to challenge their leadership, communication and presentation skills as well as their ability to collaborate with others. \"We focused on personal growth and team development through workshops on r\u00e9sum\u00e9/CV development and financial acuity and hearing from health professionals in various fields about their failure/success stories,\" Ohonba said. \"The friendships that I made from the conference are ongoing as we have created a social network group to remain connected and share our continued growth with each other. \"The skills I have learned will stay with me far beyond pharmacy school.\" Tony Ohonba works on a financial planning exercise with fellow Cardinal Health Student Leadership Conference participants. photo courtesy of Cardinal HealthASP Earns Regional Award for Awareness, Screening Activities in 'Operation Heart' Outreach The UHCOP Chapter of the American Pharmacists Association- Academy of Student Pharmacists (APhA-ASP) brought home the Operation Heart Award at the APhA-ASP Region 6 Midyear Regional Meeting Nov. 1-3 in Oklahoma City, Okla. The regional award recognized the chapter's Operation Heart activities - led by project chairs Kim Anh Pham and Omaida Hernandez-Ray - during the 2012-13 academic year. In total, more than 1,000 Houston-area residents benefited from direct wellness screenings (blood pressure, cholesterol and glucose) and several thousand people were reached through cardiovascular health education activities. Large-scale projects undertaken by the chapter included recruiting the entire P2 class to help \"coach\" community members toward their blood pressure results, weight and diet/exercise goals as part of an initiative by the American Heart Association- Gulf Coast affiliate; and performing more than 300 screenings at a soccer tournament hosted by the Spanish language ESPN Sports Radio affiliate KGOL AM 1180, which included an interview with Hernandez-Ray in Spanish about heart health that was broadcast to approximately 250,000 listeners. Chapter President-elect Ashley Trojcak and Chapter Vice President Daniel Nguyen were honored at the regional meeting with Student Recognition Certificates for their leadership roles on several chapter initiatives, including setting up a multi- organizational town hall meeting at UH on the Affordable Care Act, securing consecutive City of Houston Mayoral Proclamations for American Pharmacists Month, and creating a pharmacist recognition program and patient-casted video promoting pharmacy.

The initiative to establish IPSA was started by students Jag Maturi and Harin Kalyanji to share Indian/Pakistani cultural heritage as well as pursue service projects aimed at promoting health and wellness among the Houston area's growing Indo-Pak community and beyond. Open to all pharmacy students, the organization has grown to 50 members since gaining official recognition from UH. IPSA has hosted a Diwali celebration, a \"Bollywood\" fitness class, cricket social, and food-and-game nights with traditional ethnic cuisine and games such as carrom (similar to billiards or shuffleboard), said IPSA President Anna Zulfiqar . As part of its service mission, members have participated in several health fairs at area Hindu temples and throughout the community. \"A lot of students in pharmacy school have said I was the first IPSA's 2013-14 officers include Mathew.photo courtesy of Salman FarooqiIndian friend they've had, so it's a great opportunity to gain and share understanding of other cultural backgrounds for the benefit of students' professional and intellectual growth,\" said fellow IPSA officer Sherin Korah . With student chapters becoming officially recognized by ACCP only as recently as last fall, several students are actively recruiting members to establish a UHCOP chapter of the national organization. Despite the recent development, ACCP is not entirely new to UHCOP students. For years, students have been eligible to join on an individual basis and a team of UH pharmacy students just missed advancing to the quarterfinals of last year's ACCP Clinical Pharmacy Challenge. Development of the chapter is being coordinated through a committee within the Student Society of Health-System Pharmacists. \"The most exciting part about ACCP is the drive to discover and implement new research into pharmacy,\" said Pharm.D. candidate Jennifer Parma , who initiated the process to get a chapter after attending an ACCP annual meeting as a P2. UH Pharmacy Summer Camp Back in Session June 24-27 for High School Seniors, Juniors The UHCOP Pharmacy Summer Camp, which is designed to expose high school students to the wide-ranging and rewarding career opportunities in pharmacy and the health sciences, has been extended an extra day to run June 24-27 for the 2014 session. With support from a Walgreens Diversity Grant, the college hosted its first summer camp last year for 15 high school juniors and seniors from across the Houston area as well as the Rio Grande Valley, El Paso and San Antonio. Participants interacted with pharmacy practitioners, learned about UHCOP faculty members' current research in basic and clinical sciences, and performed a \"mock\" compounding exercise. Other activities included a field trip to the Houston Health Museum and a tour of the Texas Medical Center. Chip Lambert/UH photo The 2013 Pharmacy Summer Camp included a trip to the Health Museum of Houston, where the campers interactive exhibits and learned about UHCOP faculty members' current research projects. Camp tuition is $250, which includes breakfast and lunch. Each day's activities will begin at the college's TMC Campus (registration fee excludes any parking fees).

Founded in 1949, the IPSF represents approximately 350,000 pharmacy students and recent graduates in 70 countries worldwide. Students in the American Pharmacists Association-Academy of Student Pharmacists are automatically members of IPSF and eligible to participate in networking, advocacy and education programs in support of pharmacy practice on a global scale. In recent years, UHCOP students have attended the IPSF World Congress in such exotic locales as Bali, Indonesia, and Slovenia. During their 2-week stay in Houston, the students visited with UHCOP students, faculty, alumni and preceptors in a variety of community, clinic and health-system pharmacists, including Kelsey Seybold Clinic/KelseyCare Advantage, PCCA, TIRR Memorial Hermann, Walgreens and exchange students (seated center) Omneya Elmorshedy and Svenja Laarhuis visited with UHCOP alumni (seated) Kirti Gandhi, Denise Martinez Jonathan, and (back row) Dominic Vu, Candice Bailey, Hannia Qureshi and Marilia Cordova new KelseyCare Advantage headquarters in Pearland.Chip Lambert/UH photoExperiential training within the Texas Medical Center is highly sought not only by pharmacy students across Texas, but around the world. During the 2013-14 academic year, UH College of Pharmacy is hosting its third contingent of students pursuing a postbaccalaureate Pharm.D. degree at the National University of Singapore (NUS). To date, UHCOP faculty and preceptors at fellow TMC institutions have provided experiential training to more than a dozen NUS students in such areas as infectious diseases, solid organ transplant, cardiology/critical care, and a variety of ambulatory care specialties. The Houston-based rotations also allow extensive interaction among NUS and UHCOP students as well as pharmacy residents and fellows at the experiential sites. \"We've built a great relationship with NUS to offer their students high-level clinical training experiences that enhance the students' knowledge and skills in patient care and clinical research,\" said Kevin W. Garey, Pharm.D., M.S., FASHP, professor and chair of the Department of Clinical Sciences & Administration. \"The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, and we'd like to see it evolve into a bilateral exchange of students and faculty members.\" UH is one of several U.S. institutions with which Singaporean university contracts for overseas experiential clerkships, said NUS Assistant Professor Priscilla How, Pharm.D., BCPS. \"Collaboration with overseas pharmacy schools and institutions, such as UH College of Pharmacy, increase the variety of sites and specialty/ therapeutic areas for our students and enhance their learning experience,\" How said. \"The availability of well-trained, qualified and experienced clinicians serving as clerkship preceptors makes UH a good fit for our Pharm.D. students.\" As her stay in Houston came to a close, Doreen Tan, Pharm.D., BCPS (AQ-Cardiology), said she was inspired by everything she learned and experienced both at home and abroad through the NUS program. \"It's a privilege to return to the classroom and learn from the experts about so many advancements that have occurred in pharmacotherapy or that weren't covered when I was in the B.S. program 14 years ago,\" said Tan, a cardiovascular specialist at Singapore's Khoo Teck Puat Hospital. \"A lot of people were skeptical of my decision to go back to school, but I feel that I've come out a stronger clinician.\" Chuang Shen Hui, Pharm.D., who completed the NUS program in 2012 and serves as a senior pharmacist specializing in renal medicine at Tan Tock Seng Hospital in Singapore, said observing a combined kidney and liver transplant in person during her solid organ transplant rotation was \"something that I'll remember for life.\" The photo above features one of the first cohorts of postbaccalaureate Pharm.D. students from Singapore and UHCOP Pharm.D. students, front row, during their clinical pharmacy experiential training with St. Luke's Health System and UHCOP row. Joe Gayle/UH photoUH, TMC Preceptors Training Pharm.D. Students from Singapore ALUMNI NEWS Horton Awarded NCPA Independent Pharmacist of Year Honor UH College of Pharmacy alumnus Ed Horton, R.Ph. ('74), was honored as the National Community Pharmacists Association's Willard B. Simmons Independent Pharmacist of the Year. The owner and pharmacist- in-charge of Tanglewood Pharmacy in Stephenville, Texas, Horton received the award at the 115th Annual Convention & Trade Exposition Oct. 13 in Orlando, Fla. The award recognizes an independent pharmacist for exemplary leadership and commitment to independent pharmacy and to their community. It is named in honor of someone who exemplified these qualities: Willard B. Simmons, a former executive secretary of NCPA (then the National Association of Retail Druggists) and long-time NCPA Foundation trustee. \"To receive this tremendous honor and be recognized by your colleagues is the pinnacle of my career,\" Horton said. \"Part of what's helped me be successful and be considered for this award is the great staff around me today and in the past, as well as my wife of 40 years Carolyn, who was my first technician/office manager. \"After all these years, I still enjoy coming to work and the reward of knowing that I am helping people feel better. It's not only been an honor to receive the award, but also in the number of patients and others who've taken the time to call or write to congratulate me.\" Horton was one of three UHCOP students who participated in a pilot rotational program, which has since become the norm in pharmacy schools throughout the U.S. Horton became owner of the Kemp Family Pharmacy the next year. In 1985, he sold the pharmacy to move back to West Texas where he was raised. In 1986, he opened Tanglewood Pharmacy and Medical Supplies, which today includes walk-in patients, institutional care, drug rehabilitation facilities, mentally handicapped facilities, hospice care, home infusion, compounding and hormone replacement therapy. Horton gained a reputation as a pioneer in the industry for the extremely effective way in which he interacted with patients about the importance of their medications and how to utilize them properly. \"Back then, you didn't talk to patients,\" Horton said. \"When we did those first rotations in community and hospital settings, we learned how to counsel patients. That's what stuck with me and how I built my practice; it was my niche before you had to do it. I'm sure I wasn't the only one doing it, but it was unique.\" His pharmacy has been voted the best pharmacy in Erath County every year since 1997 by readers of the Stephenville Empire Tribune newspaper, and he was also voted the best pharmacist in 2002. He was recognized with the Distinguished Alumnus Award by his alma mater in 2007. Horton is a member of NCPA, the Texas Pharmacy Association (including serving as a Director from 2002-2005 and President for 2007-2008), the American Pharmacists Association and the Alliance of Independent Pharmacists of Texas (including currently serving on its Board of Directors). \"Our profession has to stay involved in the political arena,\" he said. \"We have to remember that one signature could wipe out this profession or any profession.\" Although Horton said he doesn't believe pharmacists necessarily need to be authorized to diagnose patients, he's a strong advocate of pharmacists gaining provider status at the national level and be compensated for their knowledge and expertise, including making therapeutic recommendations. \"If we could get paid half of what we save, you'd see a lot of cost- effectiveness while improving patient health,\" he said.

(B.S. '72), MPH, FASCP, and wife Kathy McClaugherty recently published a memoir of their inspirational journey with their late son Neal and the gifts he shared with countless others. The book - titled \"Neal: Champion, The Journey: Morning to Afternoon\" - recounts the many challenges of not only caring for Neal, a nonverbal quadriplegic born with cerebral palsy who passed in 2010 at the age of 27, but ensuring that he lived up to his maximum potential. Yet, the McClaughertys said the book is more about Neal's impact in his Friendswood community and beyond, as told in first-hand accounts by those in his network of caregivers, teachers, family members, neighbors and friends who were touched by his spirit and his smile. Among the chapters are tales from Neal's days as a student and public relations manager for the girls basketball team at his school, where a banner bearing his name hangs in the gym; attending a summer camper for special-needs children, which also served as an experiential site for several former UHCOP students; and simply enjoying a range of hobbies and interests, including watching movies and basketball games, playing golf, bowling, shopping at electronics stores, and hanging out with friends and classmates. \"We felt like it was something we needed to do to help other families in similar situations,\" Larry McClaugherty said. \"We also wanted to show our profound appreciation and love for the people who helped care for and reach out to Neal. It was a tough story to tell, but there were so many positive chapters to Neal's life. It was an emotional process, but I believe it was also therapeutic to have some closure.\" Neal McClaugherty also leaves a legacy for those he never met, including the construction of an \"all- access\" playground in his name for children with disabilities and a Texas Pharmacy Foundation scholarship endowment established in Neal's name to benefit UHCOP students (a portion of the book's proceeds will support growth of the TPF fund).

I had not been sure that I would ever hold him. I did the very same thing I did the first time for the last time. I cradled him as close as I could and I whispered into his ear that his Dad and I were there. Larry was holding his hand. I whis - pered how much we loved him and told him he was going home and he was free.\" ~ Neal's Mom, Kathy ~ \"God blessed us with a child that was more unique and exceptional than we could ever imagine. The child we named, NEAL. We selected that name because it meant CHAMPION. There are many angels that are all around us and Neal was one. His mother is another. However, in our eyes, the angels included our com - munity, family, friends, the church, the schools, the basketball girls, and the medical community. These precious angels in Neal's world are what made the journey from \"morning to afternoon\" manageable. Neal and our family did experience many lows during the journey but there were many \"magical moments\", God moments or as someone re - cently said \"God winks.\" Our dream now is that this book inspires families like ours with courage and faith that you, too, can make it.\" ~ Neal's Dad, Larry ~ \"Neal's impact on all our lives was never something I could measure in words. Neal was larger than words, bigger than life, and more impactful than any philanthropist I have ever heard speak. As Neal's basketball coach I learned just how impactful he was with his life when I watched him interact with his teammates, and his teammates with him. I have often shared the thought that life is about building relationships with others, and if \"success\" is measured by the relationships we build and nurture, Neal was certainly successful.\" ~ Former Friendswood Lady Mustangs head coach Angela Spurlock ~N E A LC H A M P I O NNEAL: CHAMPION The Journey : Morning to Afternoon The Home of The Triple-Dimpled Smile NEAL: CHAMPION The Journey : Morning to AfternoonBiundo Lauded as TPA's Pharmacist, PharmPAC Member of Year UH College of Pharmacy Dean's Advisory Council Co-Chair Bruce Biundo, R.Ph. (B.S. '61), has been recognized with the Texas Pharmacy Association's highest honors for his leadership and commitment to the organization and the pharmacy profession. After receiving the R. Louis Rumsey TPA PharmPAC Member of the Year Award at the 2013 TPA Spring Leadership Symposium, Biundo was named 2013 TPA Pharmacist of the Year at the organization's Annual Meeting & Expo. Biundo's service in TPA includes eight years on the TPA PharmPAC Board of Directors, including two years each as chair- elect and chair, and TPA vice president in 2010-11. In addition to his most recent TPA honors, Biundo was recognized with TPA's Education Excellence Award in 2008. He also has been active at the local level for many years, including serving as president of the Houston Area Pharmacy Association and the UH Pharmacy Alumni Association; a longtime member of the college's DAC; and pharmacy preceptor since the early 1980s. \"One of the biggest challenges in political advocacy is getting individuals involved because we've been conditioned to think that someone's doing it,\" Biundo said. \"You've got to be optimistic about the process. Although change is inevitable, 'the change' isn't inevitable. Legislators can't know all of the issues, so if you're not there to tell your story, someone else will tell their own.\" An independent and chain community pharmacist for most of his career, Biundo has been a consultant specializing in men's health for more than 16 years at PCCA. He has published nine articles in the International Journal of Pharmaceutical Compounding on a variety of issues related to testosterone and the male aging process. \"I feel very fortunate to be working in an area of pharmacy that I enjoy,\" Biundo said. \"It's like the 'icing on the cake' to be recognized and rewarded for doing what you truly enjoy. \" Biundo was nominated by TPA President-elect Charlotte Weller, R.Ph., Pharm.D., who has served alongside him on the boards of TPA and TPA PharmPAC. \"I cannot say enough about Bruce; he is such a good man that is committed to our profession,\" Weller said. \"He is a good leader, and the epitome of a great pharmacist.\" Fellow UHCOP alumna and 2013-14 her DAC co-chair for his tireless efforts championing the college and pharmacy. \"Bruce is a tremendous mentor to me, and I heartily congratulate him on the well-deserved awards,\" she said. \"His impact on our profession has improved the practice of pharmacy in Texas, and he continues to be a major force for pharmacy and for UH.\" Bruce Biundo's advocacy for pharmacists has earned him the highest honors from the Texas Pharmacy Association and the TPA PharmPAC. photo courtesy of PCCA 26 University of Houston College of PharmacyHardin-Oliver Takes Stakeholder Engagement Online in Presidency Texas Pharmacy Association (TPA) President and UH College of Pharmacy alumna Carole Hardin-Oliver, R.Ph. (B.S. '83), Walgreens pharmacy district supervisor, said TPA's leadership and member advocates will continue working to advance the profession on various fronts during her term. Since taking office, Hardin-Oliver has been engaging with pharmacists, students and community leaders with the mission of building consensus on pharmacy issues and sharing the experience via the TPA website. The \"Unite Pharmacy Tour of Texas with Carole\" video blog is documenting her travels and meetings across the state. In the \"Texas Stars\" feature, Hardin-Oliver is spotlighting pharmacists making a difference in their communities. One of the earliest entries featured UHCOP's own Alera Porter, Pharm.D. ('02), whose CPR training and quick action helped save the life of a man who went into anaphylactic shock following an insect sting. \"We must go forward through this interim year, working together, focused together, on the profession of pharmacy and casting off all perceived differences and past troubles to determine what our actions will be to drive the recognition and empowerment of pharmacists in health care,\" said Hardin-Oliver, who also serves as co-chair on the UHCOP Dean's Advisory Council. Hardin-OliverCritical Care Society Honors Alumnus for Leadership, Outreach UH College of Pharmacy alumnus Prasad Abraham , Pharm.D. ('98), BCPS, has become the first pharmacist to receive the Dr. Joseph and Rae Brown Award from the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM). Presented to Abraham at the SCCM's 43rd Critical Care Congress in January 2014, the award recognizes a member who has significantly advanced multiprofessional quality care for critically ill and injured patients at the regional or local level. Abraham is a critical care clinical specialist, preceptor and director of the PGY2 critical care residency program at Grady Health System in Atlanta and holds adjunct faculty appointments at Mercer University and Emory University. He serves as president of SCCM's Southeast Chapter and the membership chair for the Critical Care Pharmacotherapy Trials Network, an investigator network created in 2007 with the goal of \"conducting rigorous, multi-centered trials focused toward pharmacotherapy.\" Sandralee Blosser , M.D., FCCM, immediate past president of the Pennsylvania chapter sponsoring the award, said Abraham was selected not only for his outstanding leadership of the Southeast chapter but also for his public outreach and mentoring project for high school students. \"His goal for the (high school) project was to allow these students to shadow practitioners and to introduce them to the world of critical care,\" Blosser said. Abraham said project was in response to a growing need to promote the specialty field across all disciplines. \"One of the things we're realizing is that fewer people are getting into critical care,\" he said. \"The most exciting feedback from the students was their awareness of the team interaction: the respect and value the pharmacists, physicians, respiratory and physical therapists, nurses and social workers have for each other's roles.\" Such collaboration is part of SCCM's foundation, Abraham said. \"I was surprised, humbled and honored by the award, but I couldn't have done it on my own; the credit goes to the leadership team with the chapter and at the hospital,\" Abraham said.

Louis Rumsey ('79) Sarah Lake Wallace ('00) and David Wallace ('98) The 2013 inductees each received a crystal mortar and pestle engraved with the UHCOP logo. At the event, the college also recognized its \"Pharmacy Philanthropist\" level supports - those who have given $100,000 to the college - with red blazer embroidered with the UHCOP \"coat of arms.\" The society's Pharmacy Philanthropists are Catherine Neill ('79) and William Neill, John P. Gee ('71) and May Kan Gee, Vishnu D. Gupta and Kanta K. Gupta, David DeVido ('64) and Rosemarie DeVido. The Mading Society was established in 1997 to recognize individual donors for lifetime giving of $10,000 and corporate/foundation donors for cumulative giving of $25,000. The society was named in memory of Cora and Reagan Webb Mading, the first major benefactors of the college. Webb Mading was a registered pharmacist who owned as many as 12 drugstores, the largest independent drug store chain in Houston at the time. Upon his death in 1953, the Mading estate bequeathed $20,000 to UHCOP. For more information on the Mading Society, please contact UHCOP Director of Development Kim Jordan at 713-743-0859 or kajordan4@uh.edu.

University of Houston College of Pharmacy 29GIVING NEWS 30 University of Houston College of PharmacyStock, Property Among Non-cash Giving Options to Advance College Two recent gifts to UH College of Pharmacy's building fund highlight the range of giving non-cash giving options available to supporters. Alumni Paul Lott, R.Ph. FASCP, recently signed over several hundred shares of publicly traded stock to the college, a move they also made several years ago in establishing a scholarship endowment for UH pharmacy students. \"It's a 'win-win' option because the college benefits by receiving the full amount of the proceeds, while we benefit by not having to pay capital gains tax and receiving charitable gift credit,\" Andries-Lott said. \"The college has been very good to us by providing a great education and rewarding careers, so we're happy to help out when we can.\" When it came time to upgrade his vehicle, UHCOP faculty member Mohammad Asghar gave his retired auto to the college for auction proceeds. \"It was only within the last year that I learned about this option, and I thought it was a great way to support the college,\" Asghar said. \"It was a surprisingly simple process.\" Other non-cash giving options include: Life insurance policy; Residence/vacation home, or special collections/other property (such as art, antiques, etc.); Oil and gas interests; Charitable gift annuity, charitable remainder annuity trust or charitable reminder unitrust; and Bequest in will. Prospective donors are encouraged to consult with their financial advisor before making a gift. For information about all giving options to support the college, please contact Kim Jordan, college development director, at kajordan4@uh.edu or 713-743-0859.Throughout their lives, Charles and Mona (Falcon) Trahan have been mindful of their humble backgrounds and the obligation to help their community, including the creation of an endowed scholarship at UH for Pharm.D. students. The new scholarship caps an eventful year for the Trahan's, who celebrated not only the 50th anniversary of their marriage but also of Charles' graduation from UH College of Pharmacy (which included returning to UH for the Golden Cougar Walk with classmates during the Class of 2013 Commencement last May). \"We had a good number of classmates attend, some I had not seen since graduation night in 1963,\" Charles Trahan said. \"It was wonderful to see the young graduates and my classmates. After about 5 minutes of talking, it doesn't seem like it's been 50 years.\" A few years after graduating from UHCOP, Charles Trahan struck out on his own as independent owner/pharmacist of Trahan's Drugs in Jennings, La. During his 26-year career in pharmacy, Trahan served 14 years on the Louisiana Board of Pharmacy, including four years as president, and was recognized with the Louisiana Pharmacists Association's Bowl of Hygeia and many other honors for his professional and community service. \"The No. 1 enjoyment you have in pharmacy is the people who become patrons, building a relationship with them and watching their children grow up and mature into adults,\" he said. \"We also hired many high school students and still have relations with them as they have become adults in different walks of life. \"When people come into your pharmacy and say they have to choose between food or medication for their family, you have to do what you can to help them.\" The Trahan's sold the pharmacy in 1995 when he and Mona went into her family's Falcon Rice Mill in Crowley, La., which was started in 1942 by Mona's parents. In 2011, the mill was sold to two Trahan children and their spouses to continue operating into its third generation. It's a source of family pride that the mill uses only Louisiana-grown rice in its branded products. The mill has not only supported local rice farmers and the economy, but it also has given thousands of pounds of rice to area food banks over the years. With five children and 13 grandchildren, the couple also takes great pride in their respective family lineage. The Trahan and Falcon families migrated to Louisiana in the 1760s. \"Mona and I have been so blessed and fortunate in our lives, and we want to share it,\" Charles said. Mona and Charles Trahan recently established a scholarship endowment for Pharm.D. students at UH College of Pharmacy. Trahan Endowment Caps Year Celebrating 50th Anniversary, UHCOP Golden Cougar Status photo courtesy of Charles and Mona TrahanAmerican Pharmacies, Good Neighbor Pharmacy Support Care Lab UH College of Pharmacy's goal of creating a state-of-the-art Pharmacy Care Lab has received a major boost from American Pharmacies and AmerisourceBergen/Good Neighbor Pharmacy, with each organization providing a gift of $25,000 toward the project. Headquartered in Corpus Christi, American Pharmacies (APRx) is a for-profit, member- owned buying cooperative launched in 2002 to protect and promote the interests of independent community pharmacies. The new Pharmacy Care Lab will allow students to develop high- level, practical wokplace skills under realistic conditions, said UHCOP alumnus Alton Kanak, R.Ph. (B.S. '69), who serves on the APRx board of directors and the Dean's Advisory Council at the college. Those skills will make UH graduates even better prepared to enter the retail workforce and become entrepreneurs and catalysts for improved patient care. \"To keep independent pharmacy alive, we must start with the students,\" Kanak said. \"Independent pharmacy allows for maximum innovation in your practice. You decide how you want to run your pharmacy. I am proud to see such a strong focus on entrepreneurship and workplace skills. We are excited about the direction of the program and expect great things from the new care lab.\" For more than 30 years, Good Neighbor Pharmacy has been working to ensure independent community pharmacy maintains its integral role in today's dynamic healthcare environment. The network has grown to more than 3,200 members throughout the U.S., Puerto Rico and Guam, all working to provide improved access to quality care. \"AmerisourceBergen and Good Neighbor Pharmacy work together to provide practical, useful tools to help customers attract patients into the pharmacy and retain them through expanded services while helping them to operate their business more efficiently,\" said Alan Wilson, corporate vice president, Buying Groups. \"We believe in the personalized care patients receive at an independent community pharmacy. That's why we've created a selection of programs and services to care for these patients and help our customers succeed. \"From our managed-care network and patient-care services to advertising and marketing tools that help our customers attract more patients, seeing our independent community pharmacy customers thrive is how we define our success.\" American Pharmacies board member Alton Kanak, left, and AmerisourceBergen/Good Neighbor Pharmacy's Alan Wilson, right, present Dean Lamar Pritchard with a gift of $50,000 to help create a state-of-the-art Pharmacy Care Lab for the college. Chip Lambert/UH photo $25K Gift Boosts Fadal Scholarship's Impact on Future Pharmacists Few pharmacists are fortunate enough to be in practice long enough to provide care for three generations of patients, and it's a laudable achievement that Johnnie Fadal Jr., R.Ph. ('60), hopes other pharmacists have the opportunity to experience. To help ensure that future pharmacists on that path, Fadal recently provided a gift of $25,000 to amplify the impact of his existing endowed scholarship for Pharm.D. students at the college. Now entering his 54th year of practice, Fadal said his professional longevity said the distinction is one of his great joys and a constant reminder of his professional duty. The Waco-area native continues to work relief after retiring in 2000 from a nearly 40-year career with Eckerd, including 35 years at the same pharmacy. \"The most important thing about being a pharmacist is, 'Never forget the position of trust you hold with your patients and within your community,'\" Fadal said. Although Fadal was signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates to play professional baseball, he admits homesickness and an obligation to follow his father's advice to become a pharmacist like three of his uncles led him to UHCOP. Yet, Fadal has no regrets about the path of his life. \"It's a highly respected profession that allows you to make a good living, so it worked out very well for me,\" he said. \"If you don't go into it with a caring heart and a willingness to take the time to help your patients understand their medications, you're going to be miserable. If you go into it with a sincere heart to help people, I guarantee that whatever you put into it, you'll get double back.\" A past president of the Central Texas UH alumni club, Fadal fondly recalls treating famed Cougar basketball coach Guy V. Lewis to his favorite steakhouse whenever UH played then-conference rival Baylor University in Waco.
