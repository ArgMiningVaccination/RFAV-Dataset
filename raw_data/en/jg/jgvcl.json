Given widespread access to vaccines, this tracker is no longer being updated. COVID-19 vaccination has emerged as [one of the biggest 2021 storylines](https://www.hrdive.com/news/5-questions-to-ask-before-adopting-a-coronavirus-vaccine-policy/592559/) for the HR industry, factoring heavily into workplace reopening decisions and a variety of other policies. However, the topic may be difficult to track due to the many differences between vaccination rollout plans in each U.S. jurisdiction. To help readers who employ essential workers determine the timelines by which their workers will be eligible for vaccination, HR Dive is tracking which essential workers are included in state vaccination rollout plans.

NOTE: This tracker utilizes information made available by state governments through their websites. While some states may not identify specific worker groups for vaccination within their planning documents, some refer to the definition of \"essential critical infrastructure workforce\" as defined by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), a federal agency under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. CISA [maintains an overview document](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Version_4.0_CISA_Guidance_on_Essential_Critical_Infrastructure_Workers_FINAL%20AUG%2018v3.pdf) that describes which groups of workers meet this definition, which may be useful to employers operating in such states. Additionally, this tracker includes only the groups of essential workers that are specified in each state's rollout plan. Others may be eligible for vaccination, such as individuals in certain demographic groups or those with certain health conditions. Please view each state's vaccination plan for more details. "}
