Vitamin C Everyone is familiar with vitamin C. You can find this supplement on store shelves from various brands. But a plant based vitamin C supplement is derived from actual fruits and berries, whereas non-plant based Vitamin C supplements are partially made from acetone. Acetone is a chemical solvent that is also used to remove nail varnish. Iron Plant based iron supplements are made with Murraya Koenigii leaves. The [Murraya Koenigii](http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/PlantFinder/PlantFinderDetails.aspx?kempercode=d441) plant, also called curry leaf, is rich in iron. However, non-plant based iron supplements are made with sulphuric acid, which is a mineral acid that is widely used in chemical fertilizers. Omega-3 Omega-3 is hard to get in the diet, so it's essential to take omega-3 supplements. However, if you're a vegan or vegetarian, it's important to take a plant based omega-3 supplement, which is made from algae. Non-plant based omega-3 supplements are made with fish guts, which goes against the vegan and vegetarian lifestyles. What are the Benefits of Plant Based Supplements?
