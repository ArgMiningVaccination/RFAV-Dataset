[ Time Frame: One year beginning on day 14 after the second dose of immunization ]Protective effect against COVID 19, after 14 days following the full course of vaccination among healthy population aged 18 years old and above. Comparison of the proportions of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the two vaccine groups and the placebo group. All confirmed cases are all confirmed by DSMB blind examination. - Proportion of severe cases of SARS CoV 2 pneumonia and deaths in the two vaccine groups and the placebo group. [ Time Frame: One year beginning on day 14 after the second dose of immunization ]To evaluate the protective effect after 14 days following 2 doses of immunization of preventing severe cases of SARS CoV 2 pneumonia and deaths caused by COVID 19, among healthy population aged 18 years old and above. Comparison of the proportions of severe cases of SARS CoV 2 pneumonia and deaths in the two vaccine groups and the placebo group. - Incidence of any adverse reactions/events [ Time Frame: 12 months ]Observe the incidence of any adverse reactions/events within 30 minutes after each dose of vaccine Observe the incidence of adverse reactions/events at 0 ~ 7 days and 8 ~ 21/30 days after each dose of vaccine. Observe the incidence of serious adverse events (SAE) from the beginning of the first dose to 12 months after the whole course of immunization. - Comparison of levels of neutralizing antibodies in infected versus non infected participants [ Time Frame: After 14 days after 2 doses of immunization ]To explore the protective level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody against diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. - Number of ADE/VED cases [ Time Frame: 28days after full course of immunization. ]The occurrence of ADE/VED after immunization. - 4-fold growth rate, GMT and GMI of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody at day 28 [ Time Frame: 28days after full course of immunization. ]To evaluate the 4-fold growth rate, GMT and GMI of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody 28days after full course of immunization. - GMT of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody at 6 and 12 months [ Time Frame: 6th month and 12th month after 2 doses of immunization. ]The GMT of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody in 6th month and 12th month after 2 doses of immunization.
