Aminah Keats Experience with Naturopathic Medicine The program was very challenging but gratifying at the same time. Creating bonds with fellow classmates was also a great pleasure. As I entered my final year of study, I thought that I would join a practice near my hometown in New Jersey after graduating. However, this plan changed after my advisor suggested that I look into an integrative oncology residency. I followed her advice and quickly became interested in learning more about the role of naturopathic medicine in oncology care. I then completed a 2-year, hospital-based residency at Cancer Treatment Centers of America. That was about 13 years ago and I continue to specialize in naturopathic oncology care today. In my practice I emphasize patient-centered care by treating each patient with kindness and respect. Along with this standard, I provide patients with information and a number of different strategies that can be implemented utilizing nutrition, herbal medicine, supplementation and lifestyle factors with the goal of making the internal environment as inhospitable to cancer cells as possible. With these tools in hand my goal is to have patients feel empowered, optimistic and motivated to make significant changes to their health.
