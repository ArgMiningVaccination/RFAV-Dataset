Do not force your child to pass the stool at your convenience. Instead, train the child to understand the signals he experiences when he has an urge to pass the stools and then make him sit on the toilet seat. Remember, the urge to pass the stool only happens when the rectum is loaded with stools. When the rectum does not have stools, the child will sit and simply strain but will not pass any stools and this would be frustrating for the child as well as parents. - Teach your child about the importance of passing the stools with the urge, in case he is busy playing and avoids the urge. - Parents can develop a plan and take turns in training the child for toilet training to avoid the child associating the act of passing stool with one parent only and depending on the availability of that parent. - Do not make the transitions in the diet suddenly. The process should be gradual. - When there is a change of routine, prepare your child mentally beforehand so that the change of routine does not come as a surprise to the child. - Do not make your child rush through the morning routine. Either you may shift the routine early or be okay with the idea that the child shall pass the stool in the afternoon or evening. - Add adequate fiber to the diet. Encourage the child to eat fruits, vegetables, and salad. You may either make a routine twice where the whole family comes together to eat fruits. Praise the child for this behavior so that he continues to do the same. - Have adequate water intake: Remind the child to drink water often in the day time. If reminded often, it could become a habit later on. - Encourage the child for regular physical activity: Encouraging your kid to increase his/her physical activities, such as playing, cycling, skipping, etc., can help prevent or manage constipation effectively. You can also participate along with your children. This will help to keep you fit as well as improve the bond between you and your kids. - Besides constipation, if you note a change in behavior of your child like staying alone, being quiet, becoming reserved and depressed, you may try to coax the child to speak about the reason for the change in his/her behavior. Be supportive and listen to your child. Do not put the blame on the child. - If you think that constipation affecting your child is because of certain medicines that your child is taking, speak to your doctor about it. If in spite of following all the above care tips, your child continues to suffer from constipation, you need to consult the doctor to rule out other possible medical causes of constipation.
