Nine vaccines are examined. It is found that governments, mainly the US (with some not-for-profit entities) decisively supported corporate investments, either for R&D, manufacturing, or both, by nearly EUR 9 billion, i.e. on average EUR one billion of grants per vaccine, with, however, vast variance across companies. Moreover, almost EUR 21 billion was allocated to companies through Advance Purchase Agreements. While the EU and MS support through Advance Purchase Agreements was key to de-risk the production of vaccines, the role of EU and MS support in directly supporting R&D was marginal compared with the US federal government. The study assesses the necessity for continuing public support to R&D on vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 future variants of concern and possibly other coronaviruses. After highlighting current market failures, new incentive mechanisms in the public interest for vaccine R&D are suggested to grant equity and accessibility, as well as rewards in line with risks.
