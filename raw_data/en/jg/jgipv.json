They can be taken as part of a larger cleansing regimen often involving fasting, exercise, colonics, sauna or steam cleansing. Detox supplements work with specific areas of the body that excrete unnecessary compounds such as the liver, skin, kidneys and intestines which are responsible for getting rid of any harmful substances that may be in the body due to poor air or water quality, lack of proper nutrition or exposure. There are many benefits from taking detox supplements: glowing skin, improved energy levels, better sleep and may improve optimal functioning of the bodys system can often result from adding detox supplements to a daily routine. Allowing the liver to do its best to remove toxins is a great way to support all systems of the body. Kidneys and intestines both need a little extra love and appreciation sometimes for all the hard work they do in digestion and excretion. Everything in our body is connected and we must do our best to make sure the communication between different areas is running as smoothly as possible. "}
