They differ from the children born before them in that they are highly sensitive, have a certain deep wisdom, appear to have paranormal abilities from a very young age, and often ask the most 'difficult' questions. People soon coined all sorts of names for these children, such as New Age Children, Indigo Children and Star Children.To me they are simply children, but children who took the leap in evolution before they were actually born. Not long ago we entered a new age, the Aquarius Era. The energy of this era will make us realise that we are not human beings with souls, but souls with human beings as their vehicles. Furthermore, that these souls are energetically interconnected, that we are all 100% energy, that our bodies are energy, that thoughts are energy, that emotions are energy, and that disease is nothing but a batch of information blocking the free flow of energy. This wisdom is embedded in the hearts of these children of the new age. They are however unlucky enough to have been born during the final convulsions of that old era, the Pisces Era. During this era we became aware of our intellect, our logic, and we began to use the left side of our brain to such a degree that at some point we almost forgot about the right side of our brain. Using the left side gave people a slightly distorted view of the world: while they used to realise that KNOWing was deeply rooted in the heart, KNOWledge had now been placed in the left side. Of course the intellect is extremely important, but at times it can actually become overloaded. Do people then keep common sense in mind? Relying so heavily on the intellect can even result in masses of people accepting mere ideas as truths. However, when they do not connect to the field of such a 'TRUTH' but to the truths of their hearts, they discover that this 'TRUTH' is not so true after all. The Pisces Era is the era of Newton and Descartes, where matter and the intellect form the basis for dealing with all sorts of issues. This vision sees every living creature as a machine consisting of parts which can be repaired or replaced. It is considered wrong for man to be ill, and even death must be avoided or postponed as much as possible. At all costs, the machine must be repaired by using methods which sometimes defeat the object. Whatever happened to the age-old Hippocratic oath? (*) By the end of the 20th century, English scientist Rupert Sheldrake introduced the concept of morphic fields. A morphic field could be described as a field of energy holding certain information. People who are tuned to the resonance of such a field can pick pick up the information from this field. An anthill, for example, has its own morphic field so that the ants connected to this field know what their tasks are. The morphic field of the anthill could be defined as as the communication, the memory, the consciousness of the entire ant population. Human beings also have their morphic fields. Every family, disease, village, country, the earth and the cosmos - EVERYTHING has a morphic field! All these fields are somehow also interconnected. Children of this new age are very sensitive to these fields and easily pick up information from them. Just look at how quickly a child can use a computer or another complicated piece of equipment which used to take us ages to figure out. This also explains the situation where over a short period of time so many people can become very anxious about, for example, a much-dreaded disease. A disease has its own morphic field: the more people tune in to it, the more information its field will contain. One of the elements in this field is fear. Fear of disease, fear of death, fear of pain and goodness knows which other negativity it might hold. By being occupied with a disease, they connect with its morphic field. They consequently disconnect from their OWN knowing and are drawn into that field. This affects their immune systems, which carries the risk of them actually opening the door to the disease. Then it is just a piece of cake to persuade a large number of people into doing anything and everything not to get the disease. Such as vaccinating. Babies are not connected to that field of fear. A baby lives its life on the basis of its own source, its own heart and its own knowing! In the Netherlands, a large number of babies are now vaccinated against 7 different pathogens when they are 6 to 8 weeks old. As mentioned above, such a child is much more intuitive and therefore much more sensitive to morphic fields. On being injected with the vaccine, such a child is given an information overdose. (After all, vaccines too are energy, so they contain information and are linked to morphic fields.) This is information about the disease itself as well as the additives. The additives have frequencies which are harmful to the system because in large doses they are mainly toxic to humans. Even in small doses, however, this information is toxic to sensitive persons - both adults and children. At a telepathic level, this child is given the information or message that its self-healing abilities are no good and that society will make sure it will not become ill. This cuts right into its connection with its own SOURCE, its self-healing abilities. The more vaccines are injected, the more difficult it becomes for such a child to connect with its source. It stops the child from finding its INTERNAL 'light' and makes it dependent on the light produced by an EXTERNAL source. This is tricky, because it can be pretty dark out there. This explains why so many people apparently desperately need antidepressants nowadays. There is a growing number of people who have lost the ability to connect with their internal lights, their sources, which makes them turn to external help, help which in fact only aggravates the situation. Injecting young children with the information about diseases immediately connects them with the fields of those diseases. The related fear, insecurity and anxiety are all 'part of the deal'. This information impairs access to the self-healing abilities even more, adversely affects the immune system, weakens health, and increases the feeling of inner anxiety. These factors consequently lead a child astray from its spiritual path and prevent it from achieving full spiritual growth in life. Communication with its inner self is disrupted, which only intensifies the search for external sources of light. This in turn connects them with the morphic fields which link us to a world of illusion. I have met many children who had not been vaccinated and children who were so well detoxified that they no longer had any trace of the vaccine information. What strikes me, and often their parents as well, is that all these children are more radiant, have twinkles in their eyes (remember, the eyes are the mirror of the soul), have better self-healing abilities, and a better functioning immune system. If you realise that the source to which they are connected is love in its purest form, you can imagine that these children are usually filled to the brim with love. To me, excessive vaccination is an obsolete method, and the influence of the left side of the brain on knowledge is too extreme. So extreme, in fact, that people had lost sight of the changing character of the era. We are gradually entering an era in which we can take a holistic-energetic approach to diseases and can apply the principles of quantum physics to health care. An era in which people will be truly healthy instead of being wrapped up in ideas of fear and pain, instead of doing anything they possible can not to feel the pain and therefore not being able to recognise alternative options. Achieving this situation will require a change in awareness. As far as I can see, many people are already well underway. I hope with all my heart and soul that this development will continue so that many, many children of the new age will not have to tackle any artificial obstacles in fulfilling their spiritual tasks. (*) Hippocratic oath 'I swear by [Apollo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo) the healer, [Asclepius ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asclepius), [Hygieia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygieia) and [Panacea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panacea), and I take to witness all the gods, all the goddesses, to keep according to my ability and my judgment, the following oath and agreement: I will prescribe regimens for the good of my patients according to my ability and my judgment and never do harm to anyone. I will give no deadly medicine to anyone if asked, nor suggest any such counsel. I will not give a woman a pessary to cause an abortion. But I will preserve the purity of my life and my arts. I will not cut for stone, even for patients in whom the disease is manifest; I will leave this operation to be performed by practitioners, specialists in this art. In every house where I come I will enter only for the good of my patients. To consider dear to me, as my parents, him who taught me this art; to live in common with him and, if necessary, share my goods with him, to teach the art without fee and covenant; I will impart a knowledge of this art to my own sons, and to my teacher's sons, and to disciples bound by an indenture and oath according to the medical laws, and no others. All that may come to my knowledge in the exercise of my profession or in daily commerce with men, which ought not to be spread abroad, I will keep secret and will never reveal. If I keep this oath faithfully, may I enjoy my life and practice my art, respected by all humanity and in all times; but if I swerve from it or violate it, may the reverse be my life. I will keep myself far from all intentional ill-doing and all seduction and especially from the pleasures of love with women or men, be they free or slaves. This oath was amended in 2003. January 2013 Marianne Lucardie Spiritual Healer and Natural Therapist Marianne Lucardie - Uijldert Marianne (1952) is a holistic-energetic therapist and has had her own practice since 1988. She never really planned to become a therapist. At the age of 32 she discovered 'by chance' that she had paranormal abilities - she had always thought everyone could see and feel as much as she did. Because of a lack of proper training options for people with her gift in the 1980s, she followed many different courses. Anatomy, physiology and pathology courses at one educational centre, clinical homeopathy at another centre, a course in essential oils at yet another, etc. Until she discovered that her hands could pick up the resonance of remedies which helped her determine which remedy someone needed, no matter if this was an essential oil, a vitamin or a flower remedy. This lead her to develop a special healing method called the Flower Regression Therapy, which she still uses today. In 1998 Marianne found out that vaccinations did not have as positive an effect as people claimed, and since then she has also been treating people suffering from post-vaccination syndrome. Over the years, she has come to understand how a person gets disconnected from his source, his spiritual self, and that more holistic-energetic healing should be used to re-establish the connection with that source.
