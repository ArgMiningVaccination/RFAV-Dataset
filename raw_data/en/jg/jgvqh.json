Opportunities for innovation lie at the interfaces of disciplines \u2014 where individuals with diverse viewpoints communicate, examine problems through prisms that reflect very different perspectives, and share distinct ideas from highly disparate fields. This is what germinates new solutions to what were previously perceived as intractable clinical problems. The broad scope of the clinical and fundamental investigations summarized in this report highlight the qualities that are at the core of our department \u2014 our desire to nurture intellectual diversity, embrace individual freedom, encourage flexibility, and promote spontaneity and originality. We foster and celebrate these qualities because imaginative and inventive surgeons and investigators, students, residents, and fellows who are given the opportunity to work in diverse collaborations and teams have always been central to the creation of new pathways leading to therapeutic breakthroughs. It is the inspiration and ingenuity of our academic community that contribute to the arena of ideas, which has always distinguished surgery at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard medicine. This report is but a snapshot of the environment and activities within our department and its highly interdisciplinary collaborations in the medical, biological, chemical, mathematical, computational, and engineering sciences. As the pace of these scientific and technological advances accelerates, we have many meaningful opportunities to advance the care of our patients in every clinical discipline of surgery. As you will read in this report, our department has a robust research enter- prise with nearly $20 million dollars in funding and 40 NIH grants, as well as some 400 publications generated by our faculty and students. The impres- sive work within our department continues to attract the brightest young women and men, who perform cutting-edge science that crosses boundaries. The individuals whose research is highlighted in this report represent the very best of our department and the medical center. One and all, they are dedicated to fulfilling our mission \u2014 of serving our communities, improving health through innovation and discovery, and preparing future leaders in American surgery. \"We need to cut passages between shafts we have already dug instead of merely digging the same old shafts deeper and deeper.\" Stringfellow Barr (1897-1982), author and educatorElliot L.

Research programs in Surgery at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) include Cancer Biology, Inflammation, Development, Vascular Biology, Cardiothoracic research, Transplantation- Immunology, Obesity-Nutrition-Metabolism, Wound Healing, Epithelial and Endothelial Biology, Bioengineering, and Clinical Outcomes. The Office for Surgical Research provides an administrative infrastructure to facilitate research in the Department of Surgery. Surgical Research is headed by Per-Olof Hasselgren, MD, PhD, who is Vice Chairman for Research in Surgery at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) and the George H.A. Clowes Jr. Professor of Surgery at Harvard Medical School. Susan J. Hagen, PhD, who is Associate Vice-Chair for Research in Surgery and Associate Professor of Surgery at Harvard Medical School, assists with the management of Surgical Research. Surgical Research activities are supported by an administrative pool, with Rachel St. Fort as the former Administrative Supervisor and Molly Jay as the Administrative Assistant. Surgical Research has the following responsibilities: 1) Pre-award review and approval of all grant submissions in the Department of Surgery. This includes assisting in the process of submission of grant applications (collaborative or T32 grant applications) and interaction with the BIDMC Office of Sponsored Programs; 2) Management of research space, including laboratory and office space. For this, the allocation of research space within the department is overseen, shared tissue culture facilities are maintained, and the department is represented at various institutional committees and subcommittees dealing with research space at the BIDMC; 3) Organizing research seminars and other departmental research functions; 4) Tracking academic benchmarks in the Department of Surgery (grant submissions, grant funding, publications, etc.) and preparing the Annual Research report; 5) Organizing laboratory and shared equipment maintenance and telecommunications; 6) Supporting and mentoring junior faculty in the establishment of research laboratories; 7) Interacting with and providing information to surgical residents who plan to spend time in the research laboratory; 8) Obtaining visas for foreign scholars in research and in assistance with preparing applications for Harvard Medical School appointments for research fellows and instructors in surgery research; 9) Making recommendations concerning research faculty appointments and reappointments in Surgery (working with the Department of Surgery Appointment, Reappointment, and Promotion Committee); and 10) Assisting the chairman with the development of existing and new research areas within the Department of Surgery, including both short- and long-term strategic planning and recruitment. Research Faculty All divisions in Surgery have at least one active research program. Overall in 2011, research in the Department was conducted by 204 individuals, including: 44 faculty, 59 postdoctoral research fellows, 27 research assistants, 14 surgical residents, two nurse educators/practitioners, and many under- graduate, graduate, or medical students. Numerous research coordinators, administrative assistants, and administrative coordinators provide important administrative support for research efforts in the department.2 | Beth Israel Deaconess Medical CenterOverview of Surgical Research Many faculty members in the Department of Surgery have received and continue to receive both national and international prominence related to research. Several faculty members continued to serve or were appointed to NIH study sections or serve as ad hoc members of study sections, and a number of research faculty members serve on editorial boards or are editors for national and international journals. In 2011, many of the Research Faculty in Surgery were invited speakers around the world. Faculty members spoke in interesting locations that varied from Norway (Junger), Cape Town, South Africa (Callery), Tokyo (Hagen) and Nagoya Japan, (Hasselgren) Egypt (Jones), Hawaii (Tseng), Switzerland (Koulmanda), London (Otterbein), Qatar (Arredouani), and Chile (Sanda). Surgery investigators also received prestigious awards in 2011 including the Egil Amundson Medal (Junger), the Kenneth W. Warren Lectureship Award (Blackburn), the AHPBA Travel Grant Award (Kent), Young Investigator Awards from the American Transplant Congress and International Society for Applied Cardiovascular Biology (Peterson), the University of Rochester School of Medicine Alumni Service Award (LoGerfo), and the Eleanor and Miles Shore Scholars in Medicine Award from HMS (Poylin). Research faculty in the Department of Surgery also participated in teaching endeavors. These include acting as mentors in the NIH in-service teacher program, MIT Bioengineering Undergraduate Research Program, Biomedical Science Careers Program, Project Success, Undregraduate Research Oppor- tunities Program, and Research Scholars Institute Summer Program. The Vascular and Endovascular Surgery Division remains actively involved in the William J von Leibig research training program for both medical and posdoc- toral students. Several of the surgical research faculty teach at Harvard Medical School in the Body, Cell Biology, Pharmacology, and GI Pathophysi- ology courses and most of the surgeons in the department participate in the surgical clerkships. Research Funding All research, both basic and clinical, in the Department of Surgery is supported by external funding and more than two-thirds of this funding is in the form of NIH grants. In 2011, Surgery held: 41 NIH investigator-initiated grants and industry-partnered grants; one Department of Defense grant, and one F32 training grant, for a total of 18.9 million dollars in total awarded grant funding ( Figure 1) . It should be noted that in 2011, Surgery funding levels continued to be robust, exceeding 2006-2008 levels despite considerable budget restraints imposed on the NIH ( Figure 1) . This level of continued funding is due to the persistence and acclaim of our research programs. The level of funding is also remarkable considering that a number of faculty members who contribute substantial grant funds to the research effort are also clinically and administratively very active. The current distribution of external funding among the different divisions in the Department of Surgery is illustrated in Figure 2 . The Transplantation Surgery and Vascular/Endovascular Surgery divisions have the largest external funds, constituting more than 50% of the total departmental funding. Figure 2Figure 1: Total (direct and indi- rect, federal and non-federal) awarded funds during the 5-year period 2006-2011*. * No data was collected in 2010. Department of Surgery Research Annual Report 2011 | 3Overview of Surgical Research T32 Training Grants In 2011, the Department of Surgery continued its longstanding NIH training grant in Vascular Surgery research (PI, Frank LoGerfo, MD). Investiga- tors in Surgery also actively participated in a GI Surgery Research Training Grant, which is a joint training grant among the three Harvard Medical School teaching hospitals, led by Richard Hodin, MD, (PI), at Massachusetts General Hospital, with Per-Olof Hasselgren, MD, PhD, serving as a member of the executive committee. An additional NIH training grant for transplant immunology research is based at Brigham and Women's Hospital and is led by John Iacomini, PhD. Surgical Residents and Research Residents Scholarship Program A Clinical Scholarship Program, directed by Jim Rodrigue, PhD, Marc Schermerhorn, MD, and Scott Johnson, MD, was launched in 2011 that paired all nine first-year categorical General Surgery residents with a faculty research mentor. Mentors guide the residents throughout the year as they acquire the requisite skills to develop and implement a clinical research project. Residents were given one month of protected time, in the Spring/ Summer of 2012, to complete their clinical research project. The objectives of the Clinical Scholarship Program are to provide residents with a robust foundation for scholarship early in their training, increase their academic productivity, and enhance their opportunities to compete for outstanding fellowships and extramural research funding. Providing this experience early in the training program will facilitate residents' interest in scholarship, research, and an academic career. The curriculum includes participating in monthly Surgical Outcomes Club meetings; completing assigned readings; and attending presentations on five core research competencies, including clinical study design, biostatis- tics, communicating about research, ethics and regulatory issues, and grant writing. Residents are expected to prepare, submit, and present their research at the annual Harvard Medical School Department of Surgery Research Day, as well as submit abstracts for presentations at conferences and manuscripts for publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Residents Research Rotation Over the past few years, approximately 10 residents per year elected to spend time in a basic or clinical research laboratory as part of their surgical training. In 2011, however, 14 residents elected to do research ( Figure 3 ). Most of the residents performed research in a basic science laboratory doing bench research. The present policy is to have residents dedicate time to research between their third and fourth clinical years. The majority of residents perform research in laboratories within the Depart- ment of Surgery, but some residents spend time in other departments at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center or in laboratories off-site in Boston (for example, MIT, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Boston Children's Hospital) or other institutions, including research laboratories abroad. Figure 34 | Beth Israel Deaconess Medical CenterOverview of Surgical Research An important aspect of a Residents' research training is obtaining funding. The process that has been adopted in the department in past years is for the resident who plans to go into the laboratory to write and submit at least two credible grant/fellowship applications (typically applying at sources such as various national surgical societies, NIH, and the American College of Surgeons) - those applications are usually written together with and supported by the research mentor with whom the resident will work. If the applications are not funded, training grants in the department or other funds within the individual laboratories can frequently provide support. It is only rarely that the resident has to rely on departmental financial support for the time in the laboratory. To assist residents in obtaining funding, the Office for Surgical Research has made available a 63-page booklet entitled \"Funding Sources for Surgical Residents\" ( Figure 4 ), which describes various funding sources, deadlines, financial support available, and application forms. This booklet is updated annually. It is also available electronically at: www. bidmc.org/~/media/Files/CentersandDepartments/Surgery/Residents%20 Funding%20Sources_2009.ashx Research Abstract Competition The annual Research Abstract Competition was held again in 2011 to coin- cide with the George H. A. Clowes Visiting Professor event in the Department of Surgery. The abstract competition was open to all research trainees in the Department of Surgery, including postdoctoral research fellows (includes residents on a research rotation), and graduate and undergraduate students working in research labs in the department. The winners of this competition in the basic science and clinical research categories received a cash prize. The abstracts submitted in 2011 were truly outstanding, with eight clinical and 33 basic science abstracts submitted for the competition. Peer-review grading by members of the surgical faculty identified seven basic science and four clinical abstracts as semi-finalists for the competition, which were presented to a judging panel that included the Clowes Visiting Professor, Jeffrey B. Matthews, MD. The semi-finalists in 2011 were: Basic Science Ana Tellechea, PharmD DSC Inhibits Interferon- Signaling in Human Smooth Muscle Cells to Contain Pathological Vascular Remodeling of Transplant Arteriosclerosis\" Mentor: Christiane Lassaletta, MD in Acute Ischemia-reperfusion Injury Swine\" Mentor: Frank Sellke, MD Marco Hefti, MD \"Disordered ATP Signaling Leads to Dysregulated Breast Cancer Cell Motility\" Mentor: Wolfgang Junger, PhD Figure 4Department of Surgery Research Annual Report 2011 | 5Overview of Surgical Research Akihiro Masuzawa, MD \"Autogeneic Mitochondrial Transplantation for Myocardial Protection Ischemic in situ Blood Perfused Heart\"Mentors: James McCully, PhD, Rodney Bensley, MD \"Ultrasound-guided Percutaneous EVAR Success is Predicted by Mentor: Marc Schermerhorn, MD Martin Dib, MD \"Is Viable Tumor after Radiofrequency Ablation a Predictor of Post-Transplant Recurrence After Liver Transplantation for Hepatocellular Carcinoma?\" Mentors: Douglas Hanto, MD, PhD, and Michael Curry, MD Denis Gilmore, MD \"Real-Time Image Guided Lymphatic Mapping and Nodal Targeting in Lung Mentor: Yolanda Colson, MD, PhD During Exercise\" Mentor: Aris Veves, MD, DSC This year's first place prize in the basic science category was awarded to Harwig Moll, PhD, and in the clinical research category was awarded to Denis Gilmore, MD. Surgery Seminars Surgical Horizons In the fall of 2011, Surgical Research began a new seminar program in the Department of Surgery entitled \"Surgical Horizons.\" The objective of the Surgical Horizon's Seminar Program is to invite young emerging leaders, as well as senior leaders, from both surgical and non-surgical disciplines\u2014 including those who work in the engineering, physical, and social sciences\u2014 whose endeavors promise to dramatically alter the landscape of care for the surgical patient. The Surgical Horizons program includes a lecture from the invited speaker and a dinner in honor of the speaker attended by a small group of invited faculty and residents. Additional meetings with surgical faculty and residents also occur. The faculty hosts and speakers for 2011 are listed below: September 12, 2011 John V.

The last report was published in 2009 and highlights the program of our research faculty in Surgery. \"Novel Resuscitation Strategies\" \"We Deliver! Polymers Inflammatory Agonists and Biomarkers in Sepsis and SIRS\" \"Seven Secrets of the Prepared Investigator\" \"Qualifications Necessary for Clinical Staff to Effectively Manage Current Projects in the Retina Service\" \"An Overview of the Society of Clinical Research Associates (SoCRA)\"Department of Surgery Research Annual Report 2011 | 7Overview of Surgical Research The Annual Research Report for 2009 ( Figure 5 ), can be found at: http://www.bidmc.org/Research/Departments/Surgery/~/media/Files/ Research/Annual%20Reports/2009%20DeptOfSurgeryAnnualResearchReport.ashx Affi nity Research Collaboratives (ARC) In 2011, the Department of Surgery, in collaboration with BIDMC Research and Academic Affairs, launched a new grant program to promote interdisci- plinary bench-to-bedside research in the Department of Surgery that investi- gates innovative solutions to unmet clinical needs. This program was devel- oped by Christiane Ferran, MD, PhD, with assistance from Surgical Research. Eleven projects across multiple diciplines were submitted for competitive review. The projects lead investigator had to be a full-time member of the Department of Surgery, and the project had to involve four to five investiga- tors across diciplines. Successful applicants were awarded funds to nucleate the group in year one; to support seminars, group meetings, etc. Competitive renewal of the project will result in substantial grant funds that can be used to prepare preliminary data for grant applications. The successful ARC projects are listed below: Per-Olof Hasselgren, MD, PhD: \"Transcription Factors, Wasting\" Carl J. Hauser, MD: \"Activation of Innate Immunity by Surgery and Injury\" Samuel J. Lin, MD: \"The Use of Functional Electrochemical Stimulation in Nerve Paralysis Rehalibitation\" Frank LoGerfo, MD/Aris Veves, MD, DSc: Health, and Disease\" Appointments, Reappointmen ts, and Promotion Committee Surgical Research is involved in the Appointments, Reappointments, and Promotion Committee formed in 2003 to assist the chairman. The purpose of this committee is to review the credentials of faculty members who are being considered for reappointment or promotion at Harvard Medical School (HMS). In addition, the credentials of new faculty being recruited are reviewed by the committee before the individual is proposed for appoint- ment at HMS. The Committee is chaired by Per-Olof Hasselgren, PhD, and presently consists of eight members of the surgical faculty at the professor or associate professor level. The committee meets monthly. Research Facilities and Spaces In 2011, research in the Department of Surgery occupied approximately 27,979 square feet of space including wet labs, special purpose rooms (cold rooms, tissue culture rooms, and shared equipment rooms), and office space. Although the greatest number of research faculty and staff in Surgery are located on the 8th floor of the Dana/Research West building on the East Campus, Surgery also has research space in several different locations. These spaces include (in square feet): 8,053 in CLS (Center for Life Sciences), 13,152 Figure 58 | Beth Israel Deaconess Medical CenterOverview of Surgical Research in Dana/Research West, 488 in Slosberg-Landy, 2,638 in Research North, and 1,069 in Stoneman. Clinical research space (in square feet) includes: 452 in Palmer, 1,501 in Feldberg, and 626 in the Lowry, Deaconess, and Shapiro buildings. The overall dollar density in 2011 for research space in the Depart- ment of Surgery was approximately $200/sq foot. Tracking Academic Performance In addition to a strong performance in obtaining external research grant funding (see Figure 1), publications are an additional benchmark of the academic performance in surgery. There were 121 published original articles and 53 in press articles in 2011, many of which were in high impact journals such as PNAS, Nature, Plos1 , journals in Immunology, Gastroenterology, JAMA, Biochemical Journal , etc. There were 31 review articles contributed in 2011 and a number of case reports, commentaries, and educational mate- rials. Of particular note in 2011 were two in press books edited by Daniel Jones, MD, and colleagues; \"Pocket Surgery: The Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Handbook with contributions from Drs. gren, Poylin, and Slavin, and with from Drs. Evanson, Hamdan, Hasselgren, Jones, Lee, Lin, Sanda, and Wagner. Below is the integrated bibliography for 2011; faculty in Surgery at BIDMC are highlighted in bold.

In a landmark article published in Nature in March 2010, we established that molecular patterns from mitochondria act as DAMPs (damage-associated molecular patterns, a.k.a. 'alarmins') when they are released from injured cells. DAMPs found so far include mitochondrial DNA and formylated pep- tides that activate immunity through formyl peptide receptors (FPR1, FPRL-1 and FPRL-2) as well as Toll-like receptors. These insights have opened an entire new field of translational investigation into disease processes where cell damage and death predispose to inflammation. Mt-DAMPs cause PMN and endothelial cell (EC) activation in vitro and induce lung injury in vivo. PMN and EC conversion to their inflammatory phenotypes is a critical event predisposing to organ failure. We have a longstanding interest in the events leading to PMN activation, especially the role of Ca 2+ influx. We have now established novel systems that can evaluate PMN-EC interactions in vitro using \"real-time\" permeability changes. So we now routinely perform ex vivo experiments that evaluate the interactions between PMN and EC, the two major cell types involved in acute inflammatory lung injury. Using these systems, we have now investigated the mechanisms by which bacterial DNA and mt-DAMPs activate PMN-EC adherence and activation programs. We are also studying the endosomal Toll receptors by which mitochondrial DNA is sensed. These new findings will lead to a better understanding of the path- ways by which tissue injury leads to inflammation and organ failure in a wide variety of illnesses.

Massive bleeding in polytrauma: how can we make progress? Crit Care 2011;15(5):196. Carl J. Hauser, MDDepartment of Surgery Research Annual Report 2011 | 39Division of Acute Care Surgery Research Focus We are studying the inflammatory response to trauma. In trauma patients, ex- cessive activation of immune cells can cause severe secondary organ damage and post-traumatic complications that are a leading cause of death among patients who survive their initial traumatic injuries. Our goal is to define the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in this inflammatory process and to develop new therapeutic strategies that improve clinical outcomes after trauma. There are several ongoing projects focusing on these goals. In one project, we study the feasibility of modulating neutrophil responses with pharmacological agents that influence ATP signaling. This concept is based on our intriguing finding that ATP release and autocrine feed forward signaling through purinergic receptors is a critical early event in immune cell activation. We found that purinergic signaling is an indispensible requirement for the activation of neutrophils and other immune cell types including T-cells. Another project focuses on ATP that is released from damaged tissues and by bacteria and how these often large amounts of ATP influence the innate purinergic signaling mechanisms of neutrophils and other immune cell types. In a third project, we investigate how purinergic signaling is linked to the much better known and well-characterized calcium signaling in immune cells. In this project, we have been focusing on the development of new methods to record ATP signaling in real time. We have several ongoing clinical projects to study the role of ATP release and purinergic signaling in patients. Ongoing collaborations with former labora- tory members in Japan (Drs. Sumi and Inoue) focus on the questions how injury everity and mode of injury influence the levels of ATP and its degra- dation products in plasma. We also study how injury influences the expres- sion of the many purinergic receptors that allow immune cells to respond to extracellular ATP and its products. Finally, we are investigating how hyper- tonic resuscitation fluids, which we found to induce the release of ATP, affect inflammation, immune cell function, and clinical outcome in trauma patients.

Wolfgang Junger, PhDDepartment of Surgery Research Annual Report 2011 | 43Division of Acute Care Surgery Research Focus My laboratory investigates the signaling pathways that regulate the responses of the vascular endothelium to injury. Endothelial cells are constantly adapt- ing to changes within the extracellular environment and responding in ways that are usually beneficial but at times, could be deleterious to the organ- ism. Dysregulation of these tightly regulated physiological events results in endothelial dysfunction, which plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis, sepsis, ischemic stroke, diabetic vasculopathy, and patho- logical angiogenesis, among others. More specifically, we are focused on the signaling pathways activated by sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and the role of S1P in the regulation of endothelial responses to injury. S1P, a bioactive sphingolipid present at high levels in plasma and lymph, regulates multiple cellular responses by activating the endothelial differentiation gene family of G protein-coupled receptors (EDG-1-5, renamed S1P1-5R). To better understand the role of S1P in the regulation of endothelial cell func- tion, we have established several in vitro and in vivo systems. Using pharma- cological modulators of S1P receptors and genetic models, we have shown that S1P is a critical modulator of endothelial cell migration and endothelial barrier function in vitro, as well as angiogenesis, vascular permeability, and vascular inflammation in vivo. Interestingly, we found that vascular responses to S1P depend on the balance of expression of two of its receptors, S1P1R and S1P2R. Indeed, while activa- tion of S1P1R promotes vascular permeability and endothelial inflammation ( Figure 1). In addition, our studies have revealed the molecular mechanisms underly- ing the antagonistic effects of S1P1R and S1P2R in the regulation (PI3K), phosphatase PTEN, which antagonizes the actions of PI3K. In agreement with this model, we found that PTEN activity was required to inhibit endothelial cell migration and induction of endothelial permeability by S1P2R. Our findings emphasize the importance of understanding how S1P signaling is regulated in the endothelium. Since S1P receptors can be pharmacologically targeted by specific agonists and antagonists, understanding how S1P signal- ing is regulated both in health and disease will be critical in the design of new therapies to treat disorders of vascular permeability, inflammation, and vas- cular growth. We are presently using molecular and cell biology approaches in combination with animal models in order to further elucidate the signaling pathways activated by S1P receptors in several pathophysiological conditions, such as sepsis and stroke. Our ultimate goal is to develop new therapeutic and diagnostic approaches for vascular disease. Translational Research In collaboration with Jonathan Edlow, MD, Nate Shapiro, MD (Emergency Medicine Department, BIDMC), and Magdy Selim, MD, PhD, (Neurology Department, BIDMC) we are currently conducting a clinical study to investi- gate the role of S1P and the endothelium in stroke. We are currently analyz- ing plasma S1P levels and the levels of other endothelial markers from stroke patients to test if they can be used as biomarkers to predict stroke outcomes. In addition, in collaboration with Scott Rodig, MD, and Michael Kluk, MD, PhD, (Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital), we are in- vestigating the role of S1P signaling in lymphoma progression and spreading.

Sepsis is another example of dysregulation of endothelial responses to injury. During sepsis, the endothelium becomes hyperactivated and exhibits increased permeability and activation of inflammatory and coagulation pathways, which results in edema, endothelial dysfunction and organ failure. Using a mouse model of endotoxemia to induce systemic inflammation, we found that pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of S1P2R signaling results in less morbidity and less vascular permeability and inflammation in several organs, including kidney, liver and lung. In addition, our in vitro studies showed the critical role of S1PR2 in the pro-coagulant and pro-adhe-sion phenotype of the endothelium during inflammation. This manuscript is currently under review in Blood . In addition, we established the Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (MCAO) mouse model of stroke. In this model, transient cerebral ischemia is induced by inserting a 6-0 nylon monofilament into the internal carotid artery to block the middle cerebral artery. Then, reperfusion is established by removing the filament. Blood flow in the territory of the middle cerebral artery is monitored during the entire procedure by Laser Doppler. Using this model, we found that S1P2R plays a critical role in the regulation of brain edema and hemorrhagic transformation, two serious complications of current stroke reperfusion therapies. We are currently studying the mechanisms involved and the contribution of each cell lineage to the phenotype observed. Finally, in collaboration with Drs. Scott Rodig and Michael Kluk (Depart- ment of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital) we obtained interesting data on the role of S1P in classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Using molecular and cell biology approaches, we found that S1P potently induces motility of the classical Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines KMH2 and SupHD1 through nist, reduced S1P-induced migration. In addition, assessment Teresa Sanchez, PhDDepartment of Surgery Research Annual Report 2011 | 45Division of Acute Care Surgery of primary tumor samples from patients with Classical Hodgkin lymphoma revealed a subset of cases with very strong, membranous expression of S1P1R in Hodgkin-Reed Sternberg cells. Our data indicate that S1P1R is an attrac- tive pharmacologic target in cases of Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma which exhibit elevated S1P1R expression.

To this end, there are several funded and non-funded trials underway along with many collaborative efforts. Several of our projects are in collaboration with the Cardiothoracic Research Group in our Division (see the report by Drs. McCully and Levitsky). With them, we are examining the role of collagen type XI on aortic aneurysm formation. Collagen type XI alpha-1 (Col11a1) is thought to play an impor- tant role in collagen synthesis and brillogenesis and is known to occur in vascular tissues including the aorta. Preliminary evaluation of genomic DNA from patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms showed mutations in exon 6A of Col11a1. The purpose this study is to determine changes in Col11a1 DNA, mRNA, and protein, which may be the key element for the aneurysm forma- tion. We collaborate with the same group to examine the role of autogeneic mitochondrial transplantation for myocardial protection in the ischemic in situ blood perfused heart, which is a trial that aims to evaluate the ef cacy of autogeneic mitochondria from skeletal muscle that are transplanted into the blood perfused ischemic heart. Several collaborative clinical research projects have been developed between the Division of Cardiac Surgery and other groups within HMS and BIDMC. The most notable is with the Division of Cardiology at BIDMC as part of a national multicenter trial to investigate newer percutaneous aortic valve replacement options. The U.S. CoreValve\u00ae Pivotal Clinical Trial uses the Medtronic CoreValve\u00ae System, which is a minimally invasive, non-surgical treatment option for patients requiring aortic valve replacement who are considered at extreme or high risk for conventional surgical aortic valve replacement. CoreValve\u00ae is delivered via transcatheter aortic tion CoreValve\u00ae system received CE Mark in March 2007 and has been implanted in more than 12,000 patients worldwide in 42 countries outside the United States. Another major focus on the clinical investigational front has been in collabo- ration with the Cardiac Anesthesia group in understanding mitral valve geometry and three dimensional changes utilizing various repair techniques and different annuloplasty rings. Our collaboration with investigators at the University of Pennsylvania resulted in a multicenter NIH grant to look at echocardiography's predictive value after mitral valve repair. The goal of this project is to investigate changes in mitral leafl et geometry, which can be problem after myocardial infarction and the incidence is likely to increase with the aging population. We are also continuing our collaboration with the Vascular Surgery Divi- sion to further our research on aortic aneurysms and aortic dissections. This has been an on-going collaboration and together we have initiated studies involving complicated Type B aortic dissections (TAG 08-01), descending thoracic blunt thoracic aortic injuries (RESCUE).

Hagberg, MDDavid Liu, MD56 | Beth Israel Deaconess Medical CenterDivision of Cardiac SurgeryDepartment of Surgery Research Annual Report 2011 | 57Division of Cardiac Surgery Research Focus The primary focus of the laboratory is to elucidate the mechanisms and subcel- lular localization of biochemical and molecular events contributing to myocar- dial cell death. In particular, we are interested in the discriminant and/or coordinate contribution of necrosis and apoptosis to myocardial cell death in the mature and aged male and female with particular emphasis on the devel- opment of novel and speci c cardioprotective protocols. Our studies utilize models of stunning and ischemia/reperfusion injury in the isolated Langen- dorff perfused rabbit and the in situ blood perfused pig heart to determine the relative contribution of these pathways in the aged as compared to the mature male and female cardiac surgical patient. Our current research is focused on the following studies: Integrated Transcriptomic/Proteomic Analysis of Cardioprotection Large scale database studies have demonstrated that aged women undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) have a signi cantly higher operative mortality (4.5%) compared with that of men (2.6%; P < 0.0001) and have a signi cant increase in the incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction as compared to men (4.5% vs. 3.1%; p < 0.05). In the analysis of co-morbidities and anatomy relating to early mortality, it was noted that preoperative risk factors are more prevalent among women than men. These factors include age above 70, angina class 3 or 4, urgent operation, preoperative intraaortic balloon pump usage, congestive heart failure, previous percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, diabetes, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease and smaller coronary artery size, and smaller mean body surface area as compared to men. After adjusting for all co-morbidities including body surface area, female gender is an independent predictor of increased mortality following coronary artery bypass surgery, with a risk adjusted operative mortality of 3.81% for women as compared to 2.43% for men. The present paradigm to alleviate surgically induced ischemia/reperfusion injury requires the use of cardioplegia, however, in recent studies we have shown that the cardioprotection afforded by cardioplegia is signi cantly decreased and left (LVEDP) and infarct size are signi cantly increased in the aged female as compared to the aged male heart. Recently we have shown that the cardioprotection afforded by cardio- plegia is modulated by RNA and protein synthesis and that the inhibition of these mechanisms signi cantly decreases cardioprotection. While the mechanisms for reduced cardioprotection in the aged female remain to be fully elucidated, previous studies have shown that RNA transcription and translation are signi cantly decreased in the aged heart and that mRNA levels in the aged female are signi cantly decreased as compared to males under normal and pathological conditions. Our data led us to hypothesize that the mechanisms modulating cardioprotec- tion afforded by cardioplegia involves RNA and protein synthesis in the aged female and that these mechanisms directly contribute to increased morbidity and mortality in the aged female. To test this hypothesis we designed a series of studies to demonstrate that the cardioprotection afforded by cardioplegia is modulated by RNA and protein synthesis in the aged female. James D. McCully, PhD Associate Professor of Surgery Lab Members Akihiro Masuzawa, MDKendra M. Black, MS Sidney Levitsky, MD Cheever Professor of Surgery 58 | Beth Israel Deaconess Medical CenterDivision of Cardiac Surgery For this study, we constructed rabbit heart cDNA libraries and isolated and 5' sequenced 8647 rabbit heart cDNAs and have identi ed and stored .3000 non-redundant cDNAs with a mean insert size of 1.67 kb. These non-redun- dant cDNAs have been used to construct rabbit heart microarrays to allow for the parallel determination of relative abundance levels of the multiple tran- scriptomic /proteomic products associated with global ischemia and with the cardioprotection afforded by cardioplegia. Our published (Physiol Genomics. demon- strate partially the global isch- emia and that cardioprotection is modulated by RNA and protein dependent mechanisms. Transcriptomic and proteomic enrichment analysis indicated that global ischemia down-regulates genes/proteins associated with the mitochon- drion function and energy production and cofactor catabolism, generation of precursor metabolites of energy. In contrast, cardioplegia signi cantly increases genes/proteins mitochondrial function and signi cantly up-regulates the biological processes of muscle contraction, involuntary muscle contraction, carboxylic acid and fatty acid catabolic processes, fatty acid beta-oxidation and fatty acid metabolic processes. These preliminary studies provide the basis for the integration of the genomics and proteomics data to enhance biochemical understanding in terms of signaling pathways, biological processes, and compartmentalization and allow for the development of protocols leading to enhanced cardioprotection in the aged female through directed modulation of cardioprotection. The laboratory focus in this area is to: \u0081 Identify co-regulated RNA transcripts and functionally related gene groups and protein biomarkers to allow for enhanced cardioprotection in the aged female. \u0081 Develop methodologies allowing for the beneficial therapeutic modulation of molecular biomarkers to enhance cardioprotection and ameliorate cardiac morbidity and mortality following cardiac surgery in the aged female. Autogeneic Mitochondrial Transplantation for Surgical Cardioprotection Cell-based therapies for myocardial repair or regeneration have shown great potential; however, debate as to the ef cacy of speci c cell populations, the logistics of cell harvesting and expansion, the mechanisms of cell-based myocardial repair or regeneration remain to be elucidated. Most importantly dif culties over cell isolation, immune tolerance, cellular engraftment and integration remain. Therefore strategies to augmenT-cell delivery, cell function/ survival are crucial in permitting successful myocardial repair/regeneration through cellular therapy. Recently, we demonstrated ( Figure 2 ) that autogeneic mitochondria isolated from the patient's own body, from remote skeletal tissue unaffected by isch- emia, and then directly injected into the ischemic zone of the myocardium during early reperfusion, and signi cantly enhances post-ischemic functional recovery. Our studies also demonstrated that transplanted mitochondria are viable, respira- tion competent, maintain membrane potential, are present in the myocardium for at least 21 days after injection and are distributed from the epi- to the sub- endocardium at signi cant distance from the site of injection. James D. McCully, PhD Sidney Levitsky, MD Figure 1Department of Surgery Research Annual Report 2011 | 59Division of Cardiac Surgery The isolation and preparation of autogeneic mitochondria from remote skeletal muscle is rapid and can be performed in less than 90 minutes\u2014a time frame reasonable within the clinical interventions of both coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention for coronary elevation myocardial infarction (PCI-STEMI). Autogeneic mitochondrial transplantation provides immunological advantages for practical application without the use of anti-rejection drug therapy. The transplantation of autogenic mitochondria could be used either as an exclu- sive intervention to ameliorate myonecrosis and enhance myocardial function or could be used as a primary intervention prior to subsequent auto-, allo- or xeno-geneic cellular regenerative interventions. The laboratory focus in this area is to: \u0081 Demonstrate that autogeneic mitochondrial transplantation enhances myocardial protection in the blood perfused CABG and PCI-STEMI in situ heart model. \u0081 Optimize mitochondrial storage time in syringe, storage temperature, needle bore size, rate of ejection, mitochondrial sub fraction, the concentration of mitochondria injected, the injection route/delivery technique, the number of injection sites and the location of injection sites for use in CABG and PCI- STEMI to enhance the amelioration of myonecrosis and enhance functional recovery. \u0081 Identify specific mechanism(s) through which autogenic mitochondrial transplantation significantly enhances post-ischemic functional and significantly myonecrosis using biochemical /immunohistochem- ical, NMR and integrated transcriptomic of Collagen Type XI Alpha-1 on Aortic Aneurysm Formation The laboratory is also involved in the analysis of the role of collagen type XI alpha-1 in human aortic aneurysm formation. The major disease processes affecting the aorta are aortic aneurysms and dissections and these diseases represent a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially in ages above 65. Aortic aneurysms tend to expand asymptomatically until a catastrophic event occurs such as aortic rupture or dissection. The most common location for aneurysms is the infrarenal abdominal aorta, followed by the ascending thoracic aorta and abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) is a complex and chronic process that results from the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. The average age of patients with AAAs is 75 years and the affected men to women ratio as high as 6:1. In contrast, the average age of patients with TAA is 65 years, and men are at a slightly increased risk compared to women (1.7:1). Despite the high incidence of AAAs and TAAs in the general population and the catastrophic consequences of rupture, relatively little is understood with respect to aortic aneurysm pathology and pathogenesis. Therefore, the elucida- tion of the molecular mechanism leading to aneurysm formation will provide valuable information and will help to develop accurate diagnostic tests in order to detect the disease in its early stages.James D. McCully, PhD Sidney Levitsky, MD Figure 2 60 | Beth Israel Deaconess Medical CenterDivision of Cardiac Surgery Recently (Ann Thorac Surg 2009; 88:506-513) we showed that ATAAs have greater disorganization of extracellular matrix constituents as compared to control and that ATAAs have an increase in collagen 1(XI) within regions of cystic medial degenerative lesions ( Figure 4 ). We also showed, using real-time quantitative RT-PCR, that in ATAA tissue samples collagens type V and 1() are signi cantly and linearly increased as compared to control (P<0.001). Western blot analysis also showed that collagens 1() and V were signi - cantly increased and were linearly correlated with the size of the aneurysm (P<0.001 for both). These results demonstrated that increased collagen 1() and collagen V mRNA and protein levels are linearly correlated with the size of the aneurysm and provide a potential mechanism for the generation and progression of aneurysmal enlargement. The laboratory focus in this area is to: \u0081 Demonstrate the clinical and diagnostic utility of collagens 1() and V alterations in the detection and analysis of ATAAs in humans Research Support \"Autogenic Collaborator: Sidney Levitsky, MD Accomplishments in the Past Year Research Progress We developed an isolated perfused mouse heart model for use with wild type and knock-out mouse models.

Our primary focus is outcomes-oriented clinical research. We are collaborating in translational basic science research to understand the contri- bution of neuropeptides to the physiologic process of infl ammatory bowel disease. Basic Research Investigation into the role of neuropeptides in the pathophysiology of infl am- matory bowel disease (IBD) is the initial translational science project of the division. Vitaliy Poylin, MD, was awarded the Eleanor and Miles Shore 50th Anniversary Fellowship Program for Scholars in Medicine for 2011-2012 to support this investigation. The Fellowship program was established to help junior faculty, women and men, at the point in their careers when they must teach, do research, compete for grants, publish, or practice (if a clinical faculty member) at the same time they may be assuming increased family or other responsibilities. Neuropeptides have been studied extensively in the setting of infl ammation in vascular disease. There has been some animal investigation in IBD, but few human studies. This effort to characterize the impact of neuropeptide changes in human IBD is one of the rst investigations of this subject. We anticipate analyzing multiple control and affected specimens using an adapted assay for neuropeptide activity. We hope that this initial effort will promote further investigations that lead to an understanding of the mechanisms underlying IBD. Clinical Research Our division comprises a cross-section of providers from nurses to nurse practitioners to physicians. Our clinical research focus is currently two-fold: minimally invasive surgery and optimizing clinical outcomes for colon and rectal surgery patients. In minimally invasive colon and rectal surgery, we are leaders in single incision laparoscopic colectomy, robotic colon and rectal surgery and minimally invasive transanal surgery. We have developed and matured a prospective database of colon resection patients at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and this evolving structure supports our investiga- tions. We have multiple open IRB investigations that involve surgical resi- dents, nurses, nurse practitioners and physicians. We developed and re ned a fast-track management program for colectomy patients that is the springboard for our investigations into quality and safety. We continue to initiate projects that meld the possibility of best patient care practices with optimal outcomes and educational experiences.

Blackburn, MD, PhD, and collaborators in the Center for the Study of Nutrition Medicine (CSNM), and basic bench research led by Jin-Rong Zhou, PhD, and collaborators in the Nutrition Metabolism laboratory (NML). In the CSNM, active research projects include surgical metabolism and the study of protein sparing therapy in the prevention of starvation in patients with sepsis and trauma, prevalence of protein-calorie malnutrition in the hospitalized patient, the human metabolic response to ketosis without calorie restriction which lead me to my current focus on healthy living and the prevention and treatment of overweight and obesity and their related comor- bidities. It includes the role of fatty acids and proteins on energy biochemistry, the nutrient effects of bioactive components on cellular and molecular func-tion, and the metabolic correlates of weight loss following surgical treatment of obesity. Multidisciplinary collaborations and the dissemination of best practices in both surgical and nonsurgical interventions for the treatment of obesity and obesity-related diseases are ongoing priorities, as are several novel collaborations that bring together neurocognitive science and the science of exercise and eating behavior. The collaborators who participate in our scien- tific endeavors are as follows: Daniel B. Jones, MD, MS, Surgery, Section of MIS, BIDMC Ben Schneider, MD, Surgery, Section of MIS, BIDMC Christina C. Wee, MD, MPH Medicine, BIDMCChristos Mantzoros MD Medicine, BIDMC Alvaro Neurology, BIDMC Edward Horton, MD, Medicine, Joslin Diabetes Center David Nathan, MD, Massachusetts General Hospital The focus of basic research in the NML is the study of the role that diet and nutrition may play in the prevention and treatment of certain types of cancer such as breast, prostate, pancreatic and bladder cancers, and to investigate the mechanisms of action of active dietary and nutritional components. Research strategies include application of an integrated research system to evaluate the efficacies of dietary/nutritional regimens, to elucidate underlying cellular, molecular and epigenetic mechanisms of actions, to identify novel anti-cancer components, and to define risk factors of cancer development and progression for designing effective nutritional regimens for cancer prevention. Specific projects in each group are outlined below. Center for the Study of Nutrition Medicine We're studying the neurocognitive correlates of diet and physical activity patterns in lean and obese subjects with the Berenson-Allen Center for Noninvasive Brain Stimulation. The work is progressing. This is leading-edge research\u2014the first to demonstrate a link between variations in healthy eating, brain structure, and cognitive processes. Our findings suggest the need for novel and specific neurocognitive resources to translate nutrition advice into healthy dietary behaviors at the individual level. To enhance the safety of weight loss surgery, we've developed and studied an achievable and effective progressive resistance training (PRT) exercise protocol for severely obese patients.

Novel studies in this area will target the relations between exercise-induced changes in brain structure, neurochem- istry, and executive function; alterations that might affect dietary impulse control. We have further collaborations with the Berenson-Allen Center for Nonin- vasive Brain Stimulation in the area of enhancement of the brain circuit of inhibitory control in obese patients undergoing laparoscopic adjusted gastric banding and brain fNIRS-based methodology for the assessment of inhibitory control over food in obesity. Nutrition Metabolism Laboratory One important research contribution from the NML is the establishment and application of clinically relevant animal models of cancer progression and metastasis for nutritional intervention research. The models include orthotopic tumor animal models of prostate, breast, pancreatic and bladder cancers; an orthotopic prostate tumor model of androgen ablation-induced progression of androgen independency; an orthotopic breast tumor animal model of insufficient estrogen-induced tamoxifen-insensitive breast cancer; and genetically modified animal models of prostate, breast, and pancreatic cancers. These animal models provide important in vivo systems to evaluate the efficacy of dietary active components in the prevention and treatment of cancer and to elucidate the mechanisms of action. By using these clinically relevant animal models, we continue to identify effective dietary/nutritional regimens for cancer prevention. We are the first group to demonstrate the synergistic combination effect between soybean and tea active components on preventing breast and prostate cancers. We are also among the first few research groups to propose metabolic syndrome as a potential etiological risk factor for the development and progression of several types of cancer, and in particular, maternal metabolic disorder status as a risk factor for cancer in offspring. We are actively conducting the related research. We are applying cell function-guided extraction, fractionation and purifica- tion strategies to identify active components from Chinese herbal medicines for the prevention and therapy of cancer. In addition, we are investigating the roles that nutritional components may play in targeting cancer stem cells. Our research findings can be directly translated into future clinical investigations. Identified novel etiological risk factors may provide potential novel targets for cancer chemoprevention and therapy.

Intervention and assessment activities have been conducted according to the protocol and manual of operations. Specific accomplishments during this year include the following: Weight Loss Intervention Weight loss for participants assigned to the Lifestyle Intervention of the trial has been excellent. On average participants lost 8.6% at year 1; 4.7% at year four; and 4.5% at year seven. The intervention has been effective in all age, gender, and race/ethnicity groups. Across all clinics, 68% of participants had a >5% weight loss at year one and 47% had a > 5% weight loss at year seven. Fitness increased by 13.5% at year one and 2.4% at year four, relative to baseline. All centers have maintained the regular contact schedule with Lifestyle participants and conducted study wide campaigns. Diabetes Support and Education (DSE) The classes for DSE participants are considered optional and are used primarily for retention purposes. In year one, four classes were offered, with 1 class on diabetes required. In subsequent years, three optional classes were provided. Attendance averaged 2.9 classes per participant in year one, and 1.6, 1.4, and 1.2 classes in years two-four respectively. During months 49-60, attendance averaged .50 sessions per year; during months 61-72, it has averaged .41 sessions per year; during months 73-84 it has averaged .36 sessions per year. Participant Retention The primary outcome measures in Look AHEAD, related to CVD mortality and morbidity, are collected by phone interview at six-month intervals and as part of the annual clinic visit. Outcomes interviews (with deaths excluded) were completed by 94.6% of participants at 84 months. Although partici- pants sometimes miss one of these contacts, they are often willing to complete the subsequent contact. Currently 5.1% of the total sample is considered \"inactive\" because they have missed their two most recent outcomes assess- ments (excluding those who are deceased). If the participants who did not transfer from the UCLA site are omitted from these calculations, only 4.2% of the remaining cohort is inactive. Outcome Visits The study has completed the majority of the year eight visits on our partici- pants. Several new measures have been added to the eight-year visits (with an ARRA funding supplement). These include self-report measures of falls and physical activity. George L. Blackburn, MD, PhD Jin-Rong Zhou, PhD BIDMC/Joslin Look AHEAD TeamDepartment of Surgery Research Annual Report 2011 | 79Division of General Surgery Safety/Adjudication The Safety Committee has continued to review all serious adverse events. The Adjudication Committee has increased its membership since the number of study outcomes has accelerated. Publications and Presentations To date, there have been 80 peer-reviewed presentations and 56 peer-reviewed manuscripts. Six other manuscripts are currently under review. The year four data have been published in Archives of Internal Medicine and several other year four papers are currently under review. The June 2011 meeting of the American Diabetes Association will include a full symposium devoted to presenting four year results from the Look AHEAD trial. Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) Review The DSMB met in May 2010 and reviewed all aspects of the study. The DSMB was impressed with the study progress to date and had no concerns. The subsequent meeting of the DSMB was cancelled due to issues related to conflict-of-interest for DSMB members. NIH is currently working to reconsti- tute the DSMB membership. ARRA Supplement The ARRA supplements ended in September of 2011 and the goals of the supplement were successfully accomplished. The year eight exam was expanded to include a questionnaire on falls and vitamin supplements and the questionnaire on physical activity. In addition, the ARRA supplements allowed sites to provide home visits as needed to collect outcomes data on this aging cohort, and to continue to offer intensive lifestyle programs. To accomplish the aims of the ARRA Supplement, the Joslin Diabetes Center and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center increased the hours of the research assistant on the study to allow additional time to assist with collection of data. In addition, the effort of a lifestyle interventionist was increased to permit further efforts to maintain the outstanding weight losses seen to date in Look AHEAD. Planning for the Future Look AHEAD continues to devote significant time and effort to delivering the ongoing intervention and conducting assessments of all participants. In addition, the Look AHEAD study group has developed a genetics working group to consider future funding in this area. A grant application has been submitted to extend our genetic analyses and participants are currently being consented for a future GWAS study. The steering committee has also begun to actively plan for the close-out of the trial. A time-line of key activities has been developed and each committee is considering how best to complete assessment and intervention activities and to communicate the results to the participants and the scientific community. The study group is considering future grant applications that would allow for further follow-up of this well characterized cohort and/or provide novel approaches to long-term weight loss interventions.

Blackburn, MD, PhD Jin-Rong Zhou, PhD80 | Beth Israel Deaconess Medical CenterDivision of General Surgery The Joslin Diabetes Center/Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center site: The study has continued to proceed very smoothly at The Joslin Diabetes Center/ Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center site. Our average weight loss for participants in the lifestyle arm is 8.3% at 1 year and 7.9% at 2 year, 6.4% at year 6 and 4.6% at year 8. We have been able to retain most participants in the trial and completed the outcomes assessment on 83% at year 7. Members of our group are participating in writing groups for manuscripts related to 4 year results. Boston Nutrition Obesity Research Center (BNORC) - Administrative Core The Boston Nutrition Obesity Research Center (BNORC), administratively based at Boston Medical Center (BMC), provides resources and support for studies in the area of nutrition and obesity. Funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Center was established to explore the natural history of obesity, to investigate energy metabolism in health and disease, and to educate and train new investigators in these areas. Progress in the last year is as follows: Understanding How Patients Value Bariatric Surgery Christina Wee, MD, (PI) and the team studied over 650 patients seeking WLS and examined their expectations, motivations, and the lengths they are willing to undertake to undergo these procedures. We also explored the factors associ- ated with unrealistic weight loss expectations and patients' willingness. Lifestyle Intervention Study in Adjuvant Treatment of Early Breast Cancer (LISA) The goal of this project is to determine if a telephone and mail-based indi- vidualized lifestyle intervention program focusing on weight management can improve outcomes in postmenopausal women with early stage breast cancer. The LISA study has enrolled 313 patients overall. The patient count at BIDMC is currently 24. The funding for this study has been reduced and this study is closed for enrollment. All cancer clinical trials were suspended and audited by an independent auditor. We fulfilled all of the auditors' require- ments and the suspension was lifted. Neurocognitive Correlates of Binge Eating Disorder This study, led by Miguel Alonso-Alonso, MD, sought to explore the neurocognitive correlates of binge eating disorder using brain stimulation to modulate activity in areas linked to inhibitory control. This study was a double-blinded placebo-controlled pilot study where a total of 16 subjects were randomized to receive ten days of 20 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), left DLPFC, or sham stimulation. Participants were assessed using a combination of clinical (binge diaries, questionnaires on eating behavior, mood and obses- sions), and experimental (a multi-choice buffet meal test, computer-based tasks and neuroimaging) measures. George L. Blackburn, MD, PhD Jin-Rong Zhou, PhDDepartment of Surgery Research Annual Report 2011 | 81Division of General Surgery Eff ects of BMI on Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) Currently, researchers do not design tDCS studies to account for BMI differ- ences between subjects. However, the amount of cranial fat varies with BMI. tDCS is gaining popularity as a research tool for neuromodulation and understanding how the effects of tDCS differ due to subject variability is of critical importance to ensure consistent results as more studies are conducted in diverse subject pools. Miguel Alonso-Alonso, MD, and team partnered with Dr. Marom Bikson at the neural engineering laboratory at the City College of New York to deter- mine if BMI would affect the current distribution when tDCS using models of brains from subjects with varying BMIs. As of December 2011, the team had developed a repository of 5 MRIs to develop models from and was in the process of building the 3D models. Neuroband This project will involve testing the effectiveness of tDCS in modulating activity in patients undergoing gastric banding to replicate the brain changes seen in patients who underwent roux-en-Y gastric bypass and attempt to improve the overall weight loss of these patients. A brain fNIRS-based methodology for the assessment of inhibitory control over food in obesity The aim of the group under the leadership of Alonso- Alonso is to develop a novel methodology for its objective assessment via brain changes using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Compared to other available techniques (i.e., fMRI), fNIRS is faster and more affordable, convenient, and comfortable for subjects, and thus, easier to incorporate into routine clinical practice. Neurocognitive Evaluation of a Dietary Intervention with Diff erent Carbohydrate Sources (Fructose, Glucose, High Fructose Corn Syrup and Sucrose) This is an ancillary study proposal related to the parent project being conducted at another facility. It is entitled: \"A Comparison of the Metabolic Effects of Fructose, Glucose, High Fructose Corn Syrup and Sucrose at Normal Population Consumed Levels on Liver and Muscle Fatty Infiltration, Insulin Resistance, Glucose, Insulin, Leptin, Ghrelin, Postprandial Triglycer- ides, LDL Particle Size, Uric Acid and Appetite in Adults Aged 20-60 Years Old.\" Testing Causality in the Association Between Exercise and Neurocognitive Gains: A Translational Research Study We propose to conduct a multidisciplinary research study to investigate whether or not the grey matter volume changes that are observed after increased, intensive exercise are directly responsible for enhanced cogni- tive function. This investigation addresses a fundamental question that is of high relevance in the field, due to the vast range of implications for athletic training, cognitive development, neurological disorders, age-related cognitive decline, and obesity. To accomplish this, we will use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to disrupt brain activity during cognitive performance, both before and after an exercise intervention, and assess whether exercise can lead to increase resistance to disruption by TMS.George L. Blackburn, MD, PhD Jin-Rong Zhou, PhD82 | Beth Israel Deaconess Medical CenterDivision of General Surgery The Relationship of Medications that Cause Hypoglycemia and Glucose Control to Weight Loss in Year-One of the Look AHEAD Study We hypothesize that the use of insulin and sulfonylurea drugs and the degree of diabetic control associated with their use will be inversely proportional to weight gain and will give both greater hypoglycemia and weight gain than other diabetic drugs being tracked in the Look AHEAD database during the first year of the trial in the intensive lifestyle intervention. Nutrition Metabolism Laboratory Tanshinones as Eff ective Therapeutic Agents for Prostate Cancer Progression The goals of this study were to define the therapeutic efficacy of tanshinone I (T1) and tanshinone IIA (T2A), alone and in combinations on prostate cancer progression in clinically relevant animal models of prostate tumor progression, and to identify the cellular and molecular biomarkers associ- ated with therapeutic activities of T1 and T2A to gain insights into possible mechanisms of action. In 2011, we conducted the LNCaP tumor animal study to determine the effects of T1 and T2A, alone and in combinations on the growth of androgen-sensitive prostate tumors. Since cryptotanshinone (CT) is another major tanshinone in Danshen, we also evaluated its effect on the growth inhibition of LNCaP tumors so that the anti-LNCaP activities of all three major tanshinones could be compared simultaneously. In brief, male SCID mice were fed the AIN-93M diet for one week of adaptation before being inoculated orthotopically with 2 x 106 of LNCaP cells. Mice were randomly assigned into one of the following experimental groups (n=12/ group) and treated with the assigned experimental treatments: (1) Control (100 l corn oil as vehicle), (2)-(3) T1 in corn oil at 100mg/kg BW by BW by 200/200 mg/kg BW. Food intake and body weight were measured weekly. At the end of the experiments (12 weeks after cell inoculation), the mice were sacrificed; primary tumors were excised and weighed. A tumor slice from each primary tumor tissue was carefully dissected and fixed in 10% buffer- neutralized formalin, paraffin-embedded, and sectioned at 4 m thickness for immunohistochemistry. An aliquot of each tumor sample was used to extract total RNA for real-time PCR. The results are shown as follows. We found that: \u0081 Both T1 and CT showed dose-dependent effects on inhibiting the growth of LNCaP tumors, but to our surprise, T2A did not show significant effect. \u0081 Interestingly, CT also showed significant activity. Our in vitro studies showed CT had the least potent activity against prostate cancer cell growth with IC50s around 25-50 M, compared with T1 or T2A. This increased bioactivity of CT may be in part due to its higher bioavailability since it was reported that CT had higher bioavailability than other tanshinones. \u0081 The combination of T1 and T2A did not show further enhanced activity in inhibiting the LNCaP tumor growth, suggesting that the combination may not be synergistic or additive. \u0081 Both T1 and T2A did not significant inhibiting LN metas- tasis, but CT inhibited LN metastasis and the inhibitory effect at 200mg/kg BW was significant. This finding suggests that CT may have potent anti-growth and anti-metastasis activities against LNCaP tumor in vivo.George L. Blackburn, MD, PhD Jin-Rong Zhou, PhDDepartment of Surgery Research Annual Report 2011 | 83Division of General Surgery \u0081 The treatments did not significantly alter food intake or body weight, confirming that tanshinones at the efficacious doses do not have significant side effects.

Fueled by a robust clinical practice that focuses on treatment of pancreatic malignancies, cystic lesions, pancreatitis, and complex biliary conditions in a multidisciplinary setting, we perform over 200 major pancre- aticobiliary operations per annum. A prospective database of over 4000 opera- tions and 750 pancreatic resections has been developed and maintained from this practice, and provides the substrate for our investigations. Areas of emphasis have been the development and critical analysis of clinical pathways and other systems initiatives for optimal patient care. Separate investigations are centered on technical and perioperative management aspects of surgical care for diseases of the pancreas and biliary tree. Also explored has been the impact of surgical complications associated with these operations. We are now also embarking on Quality of Life analyses for these disease processes. We are currently building a Quality Scorecard for Pancreatic Surgery that refl ects the Institute of Medicine HealthCare Quality Domains. Accomplishments in the Past Year Research Progress One of our primary endeavors has been in caring for patients with incidentally identi ed, asymptomatic pancreatic lesions. This clinical focus by our group has led to a landmark publication that describes the predominance of malig- nant and premalignant pathologies encountered in this scenario. Other work has contributed to a better understanding of managing cystic lesions of the pancreas - particularly Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm (IPMN). We continue to establish parameters of recovery following pancreatic resections. We have de ned benchmark outcomes for pancreatic resections in the elderly cohort (> 75 y.o.) featuring our interdisciplinary collaboration with geron- tology consultation. We have also described the importance of optimal operative performance, including minimizing blood loss, as well as the negative infl uence of preopera- tive hospitalization for patients requiring pancreatic resection. We are also very interested in the emerging concept of \"borderline resectable\" pancreatic tumors, and have illustrated the predictive capacity of CT angiograms for this problem. In addition, through collaboration with our Radiology and Oncology consultants, we de ned the value of Cyberknife radiotherapy for pancreatic cancer, both on locally advanced disease, as well as the situation of positive margins following resection. Other investigations have focused on technical approaches to pancreatic surgery, and we have contributed to two Consensus Conference monographs on pancreatic cancer surgery. We are deepening our investigations relating to quality metrics in high-acuity pancreatic surgery including mortality and readmission rates, offering compelling root-cause analyses of each. We remain active in the leadership of all major national and international specialty soci- eties in HPB and GI Surgery. Mark P .

Assessing the ideal body image for Ghanaian women and men Obesity and the linked illnesses are highly prevalent in Accra, the capital and largest city in Ghana. General reasons for obesity include genetics, lack of exercise, and increased dietary intake. Another possible reason for obesity is culture. This study assesses the cultural ideal body image for both men and women and compares gender differences in perception of ideal body image. The study expands to other regions of Ghana for comparative analysis. We also have two additional clinical studies underway. First is \"Knowl- edge, attittude, and practice: Self-breast examinations as a screening tool in resource poor communities.\" The second is the Clinical Scholarship Program (in collaboration with Ranjna Sharma, MD, and Ali Links, MD). This study examines atypical hyperplasia of the breast and the role of excision following lesion removal by core biopsy.

Duda, MD, MPHDepartment of Surgery Research Annual Report 2011 | 97Division of General Surgery Research Focus The focus of my laboratory is to understand how Helicobacter pylori infec- tion facilitates gastric atrophy, which is an important initiator of cancer development along the gastric cancer cascade ( Figure 1 ). Gastric cancer is the third most common cancer and the second most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Despite the global prominence of H. pylori infection and gastric cancer, little is known about how this infection-mediated cancer develops. Gastric atrophy occurs when mature epithelial cells, namely parietal and chief cells, die rapidly during infection. We thus approach our work by studying mechanisms that regulate cell survival and death in gastric epithelial cells. In particular, we are interested in the role of inflammation in parietal and chief cell death that is caused, at least in part, by mucosal barrier dysfunction at tight junctions. Tight junction dysfunction allows the permeation of luminal contents across the mucosa, which is particularly toxic to epithelial cells in the stomach in addition to being essential for perpetuating inflammation. We recently found that pro-inflammatory cytokines increase mucosal permeabili- ty by transcriptionally regulating tight junction proteins and that ammonia, a luminal cytotoxin elicited by H. pylori , kills gastric epithelial cells by a newly described mechanism (see the Research Progress and Bibliography sections). In a second approach, we study how survival and death mechanisms are regu- lated in gastric epithelial cells to gain an understanding of how these path- ways are blocked in cancer development. This approach has been challenging, since gastric parietal cells do not express any of the classical BCL-2-family proteins like BCL-2, BAX, BAK, etc. In the past year we identified brain- type N-methyl- d-aspartate channels, which are calcium transport channels, in parietal cells and studied the role of these channels in regulating apoptosis mechanisms. In both cases, we are interested in uncovering therapeutic tar- gets to block gastric atrophy and cancer development during infection.

In the past year, we found that IL-1 , via p38 MAPK activation, significantly decreased barrier function in gastric epithelial cells. When we explored the mechanism behind this change in barrier function, we learned that the stomach expresses one particular tight junction protein, claudin-18 ( Figure 2, blue box ), which is responsible for limiting the paracellular flux of H+ across the mucosa; when knocked-out, there is severe mucosal injury and gastric atrophy in the stomach within three days of birth due to acid back-diffusion from acid secre- tion. IL-1 IFN blocked expres- sion in vitro, which resulted in robust paracellular flux. We found that more than 80% of gastric glands have no claudin-18 in H. pylori -infected stomach, suggesting that this important change in tight junction structure alone drives an increase in paracellular flux, mucosal injury, and gastric atrophy during infection. We plan to use the claudin-18 knockout mice to explore the features of infection that are responsible for cancer development. In addition to important changes in claudin-18 expression we found that claudin-7, which is not normally expressed in the stomach, was highly up-regulated by IL-1 in vivo and in vitro in H. pylori -infected mice. While claudin-7 is a tight junction component, the interesting aspect of its localiza- tion in H. pylori infection is that claudin-7 shows robust apical staining that is similar to the localization of mucins and trefoil factor. This unexpected finding suggests that claudin-7 may be protective in some way, but knockout will be required to understand its role in barrier function. At present, the cytoplasmic localization of claudin-7 suggests that it is an infection-mediated tumor promoter with no role in regulating tight junction function. The results of our work on IL-1 , claudin-18, and claudin-7 were accepted for presentation at the FASEB meeting in April (2012) and the Digestive Diseases Week meeting in May (2012) as oral presentations. NMDA Channels, Calcium (Ca 2+) Infl ux, and Cell Death Mechanisms in Gastric Cells In the past year, we discovered that gastric epithelial cells express N-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA) channels, which are brain-specific glutamate channels NMDA channels consist subunits, NR1 and NR2, have glutamate and glycine regulatory binding sites, require zinc, and the open channel is inhibited dose-dependently by magnesium and other pharmacological blockers ( Figure 3 ). We found that ammonium, a cyto- toxin liberated by H. pylori , reduces epithelial cell viability by excessive Ca2+ permeation through NMDA channels and concluded that NMDA channels may be essential to regulate cell survival and death pathways in H. pylori infection. To examine NMDA channel activation in H. pylori infection, we showed that ammonium increased Ca2+ permeation in gastric epithelial cells in a cAMP-dependent manner, which was blocked by NMDA NR2B receptor, open channel, and cell signaling antagonists. Wild-type H. pylori (producing ammonium), but not urease mutant H. pylori (no ammonia production), showed extensive Ca2+ permeation that was blocked when NMDA receptor expression was repressed. The mechanism used to affecT- cell viability was that Ca2+ entered cells and activated proteases, including cathepsins and calpain. Ca2+ was vacuoles Susan J.

Inositol-3-phosphate- dependent release of Ca2+ from ER and protease activity damaged mitochon- dria, reduced ATP, and transcriptionally up-regulated the expression of cell death effectors\u2014all of which ultimately killed the cells. Additional data showed that NMDA receptor expression is transcriptionally up-regulated in surface epithelial cells by H. pylori in vitro, consistent with in vivo expression studies in H. pylori infected mice. In parietal cells, however, NMDA receptor expression is down-regulated early in infection before any mucosal changes are evident. We are currently working to understand the role of NMDA channels in parietal cells, which may prove to be essential in regulating their survival program in collaboration with cell signaling pathways activated during acid secretion. This work was published in December 2011 (see references) and also resulted in an editorial about the importance of this new finding. Administrative Accomplishments I continued to work as Associate Vice-Chair for Research in the Department of Surgery. Accomplishments this year were successful completion of a new administrative infrastructure in my office, which consisted of writing new job descriptions, hiring, and training two new employees. Rachel St. Fort (photo, right) was hired as the new Research Administrative Supervisor for Research and Molly Jay (photo, below) was hired as the new Administrative Assistant for Research. With Wendy Dasgupta, our prior Administrative Coordinator, a mechanism to collect data on scholarly publications by investigators in Surgery was instituted by creating a sophisticated database that is collected by Division in myNCBI. This listing of publications is distributed to the Faculty in Surgery and will be highlighted quarterly in Surgery Notes . We better integrated non-clinical and clinical faculty/staff by encouraging participation in Surgical Grand Rounds and departmental faculty meetings. My office assisted with the set-up of Affinity Research Collaboratives (ARCs), headed by Dr. Ferran. I got the T32 (training) grant program up and running with administrative support and the first T32 grant application will be submitted in January 2012. I instituted and the office administratively supported a new seminar series, \"Surgical Horizons,\" which hosts a research seminar once per month that features an emerging leader in surgery. In 2011, I also organized a series of group meet- ings for clinical staff, to better support that group in surgery. I also continued to direct the Microscopy, Histology, and Confocal Core Facilities at BIDMC and to provide oversight and consultation for imaging experiments in the hospital and for members of the Harvard Digestive Diseases Center, for which I serve as the imaging core director. I also serve as Director of the Electron Microscopy Core within the BIDMC Microscopy Core Facility and in the past year, developed tomography as a new technique to visualize microscopic structures in 3D.

Hagen, PhD Andrea Calhoun at the new JEOL 1400 Electron Microscope102 | Beth Israel Deaconess Medical CenterDivision of General SurgeryDepartment of Surgery Research Annual Report 2011 | 103Division of General Surgery Research Focus The research in our group is focused on mechanisms regulating the cata- bolic response to sepsis and injury in skeletal muscle. Sepsis and injury (and a number of other conditions as well, including cancer, AIDS, uremia, and starvation) are associated with muscle wasting ( Figure 1 ), mainly reflecting ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation of the myofibrillar proteins actin and myosin. This response in skeletal muscle has severe clinical conse- quences, including muscle weakness and fatigue, delayed ambulation with risk of thromboembolic and pulmonary complications, and prolonged stay in the intensive care unit. Our research supports a model in which myofilaments are released from the sarcomere through a calcium/calpain-dependent mecha- nism followed by ubiquitination of actin and myosin by the 26S proteasome. The gene expression of calpains and several components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, in particular the ubiquitin ligases atrogin-1 and MuRF1, is upregulated in atrophying muscle, supporting the concept that increased gene transcription is an integral part of muscle wasting mechanisms. Currently, the transcriptional regulation of genes in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is examined. In particular, the roles of the transcription factors C/ EBP and and NF-kB as well as the nuclear co-factors p300 and PGC-1 and in the regulation of atrogin-1 and MuRF1 expression are examined. In addition, the role of calcium in sepsis-induced and glucocorticoid-regulated muscle proteolysis is examined, in particular with regards to changes in store- operated calcium entry and regulation of calcium-calmodulin protein kinase II and PI3K/Akt/GSK3 signaling. In recent studies we have found evidence that p300-regulated acetylation of certain transcription factors and probably other nuclear proteins as well regulates protein breakdown in catabolic muscle. Our current under- standing of some of the molecular mechanisms involved in muscle wasting, in particular the role of transcription factors and nuclear co-factors, is summa- rized in Figure 2. The long-term goal of our studies is to define molecular mechanisms responsible for sepsis-induced muscle proteolysis and to define molecule(s) that can be targeted to prevent and treat muscle wasting in sepsis and other catabolic conditions. Transcription factors involved in muscle wasting are regulated by multiple posttranslational modifications. For example, the transcription factor C/ EBP can be activated by acetylation and phosphorylation. Indeed, recent experiments in our laboratory have provided evidence that C/EBP is acety- lated at multiple sites in dexamethasone-treated myotubes and in the same experimental model, silencing of the histone acetyl transferase p300 blocks dexamethasone-induced protein degradation in cultured myotubes. Thus, the regulation of protein degradation in atrophying muscle is complex and factors influencing protein degradation in catabolic muscle are regulated at multiple levels.

We have focused on minimally invasive surgery, bariatric surgery, and technical skill acquisition. Bench-top work last year has led to better models and simulators, and may lead to a new understanding of hormonal regulation of obesity. The Section for Minimally Invasive Surgery has trained medical students, resi- dents, research fellows, clinical fellows, and surgeons worldwide in advanced laparoscopic techniques and founded the the Carl J. Shapiro Simulation and Skills Center. Education research is focused on establishing a technical skills laboratory validating new teaching tools and instituting curriculums for Harvard Medical School students and BIDMC residents. Research assesses team simulation in the unique mock laparoscopy endosuite. BIDMC was the first Level I Comprehensive Education Institute accredited by the American College of Surgeons in New England. In 2009 BIDMC reac- credited SASC. We continue to collaborate with Nice Medical School Simula- tion Center in France. In collaboration with Ram Chuttani, MD, of GI Endoscopy (Department of Medicine at BIDMC) we have developed new natural orifice transluminal endoscopic approaches to pancreatic resection in the animal model. NOTES techniques may achieve comparable outcomes with faster recuperation. Collaborative efforts have also worked towards developing better simula- tors. With S. De, PhD at RPI we have been awarded $10 million of NIH R01 grants to create a virtual reality laparoscopic simulator for teaching laparo- scopic procedures, electrosurgical principles, FLS testing, and NOTES. The aim of the NOTES project is to design and simulator to develop NOTES procedures and then use simulator to train surgeons safely. There are ongoing NIH Collaborative Projects among the Center for Modeling, Simulation and Imaging in Medicine (CeMSIM), Rensselaer Poly- technic Institute (RPI), Carl J. Shapiro Simulation and Skills Center, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), and the Tufts University. There are three ongoing NIH funded projects (#1-3) and a project on trainer for virtual electrosurgery (#4). The project descriptions follow. 1. Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Skills Trainer (VBLaST) 2. Virtual Natural Ori ce Transluminal EndoScopic Surgery (VR-NOTES) simulator 3. Generation (Gen) 2 cognitive simulator 4. Virtual Electrosurgery Trainer (VEST) Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Skills Trainer Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS), is a set of five basic tasks which has been approved for skills training and credentials in North America. The Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Skills Trainer (VBLaST) is a virtual reality trainer that replicates the FLS tasks for skills training. In this project, a specialized interface with haptic feedback was built at CeMSIM, RPI to replicate the FLS box for the VBLaST. Currently in the project, three tasks of the FLS namely, Peg Transfer, Pattern Cutting and Ligating Loop have been implemented. Daniel B.

MIS 108 | Beth Deaconess Medical CenterDivision of General Surgery Construct and convergent validity for the Peg Transfer task have also been completed with subject pool of medical students, residents, Fellows and attendings from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Validation study for the Pattern Cutting and Ligating Loop simulations are planned to be undertaken in early December of 2011. Virtual Natural Orifi ce Transluminal EndoScopic Surgery (VR-NOTES) simulator NOTES is an emerging technology which is currently undergoing FDA approved clinical trials in U.S. The surgery has also been performed at many places around the world. Due to its experimental nature, NOTES requires extensive testing/training in animal or virtual simulator models before successfully transitioning to humans. The instrumentation used for NOTES is derived from traditional endoscopic surgery and may require changes for which a realistic test bed is needed. Animal models are expensive and have to be replenished after each procedure. In order to provide a training and testing platform for NOTES, the VR-NOTES simulator is being developed at CeMSIM, RPI. A need analysis study was performed at the 2011 Annual NOSCAR conference to iden- tify, the procedure that should be simulated for NOTES along with the possible routes, type and number of channels of the scope for interaction. NOTES-Cholecystectomy was chosen as the target procedure based on the overwhelming response from the study participants. Both transgastric and transvaginal approaches are being modeled in the VR-NOTES simulator. Currently, the VR-NOTES simulator has virtual organ models through which a fly through simulation can be done along the predetermined path for trans- gastric approach. A haptic interface with realistic flexible endoscope is being developed to interact with the VR-NOTES simulator. Generation (Gen) 2 cognitive simulator The virtual reality simulators that have been developed so far have been focused on either part-task or procedural simulations with an overall goal of increasing the psychomotor skills of the trainees. Though there are some simulators that can give you evaluations at the completion of the procedure, no real-time feedback systems exist for giving feedback to the trainee on the fly. Moreover, creating an environment as close to real surgery as possible including, the operating room environment, devices, and noises in the room, would make the training very realistic. To test this hypothesis, the Gen 2 simulator is being currently developed at the CeMSIM, RPI. The simulator will train on the LAGB procedure using SILS technique. The models and simulation that was developed for our previous simulator for LAGB using multi-port laparoscopic technique (Gen 1) is being used for the Gen2 simulator. In addition, a virtual operating room is being currently modeled to provide a realistic environment for the trainee and increase the cognitive fidelity of the simulator. A cognitive feedback module will be devel- oped in 2012 and validation studies are planned for the end of 2012.Daniel B. Jones, MD, MS, FACS VBlaST Haptic Interface VBlaST Transfer VBlaST Ligating Loop Task VBlaST Pattern Cutting TaskDepartment of Surgery Research Annual Report 2011 | 109Division of General Surgery Virtual Electrosurgery Trainer (VEST) Electrosurgery is an important technique that needs to be mastered. Training in electrosurgery is difficult since using in vitro models produce dangerous smoke and active energy should be used at all times. Moreover, clear under-standing of the principles of electrosurgery is needed to effectively operate the devices. A virtual reality simulator for electrosurgery will be a valuable tool since the procedure can be repeated any number of times without the need to change the models, clearing smoke or using an actual energy source. The virtual electrosurgery trainer (VEST) is an ongoing project at the CeMSIM, RPI, that currently includes basic modules to teach possible ways of patient injury during an electrosurgery procedure. VEST can simulate, insulation failure, capacitive and direct coupling. An interface with two ports for trocar and tool placement whose motion are captured by optical and gyroscope sensors was built to interface the VEST for testing. The system was successfully demonstrated to the expert surgeons during the SAGES meeting in Boston this year. Collaborative studies with Christina Wee, MD, study risk assessment among patients considering weight loss operations This NIH RO1 funded project assembles a racially diverse cohort of 650 patients recruited from two bariatric centers and a cross-sectional sample of 600 primary care patients from the community in order to examine the perspectives and experiences of patients seriously contemplating weight loss surgery and those who are less likely to undergo surgery. Goals of the project are to better understand patients' preferences and value for weight loss and outcomes of bariatric surgery, identify factors and patient characteristics that predict greatest value and benefit from surgery, and identify barriers and factors that influence decision-making among those not already committed to this treatment. An important overarching aim of the project will be to better understand the factors and barriers that might explain current observed racial variation in the use of bariatric surgery and after several years this ongoing data base will provide a robust too for clinical investigation.

Electrochemical Activation and Inhibition of Neuromuscular Systems through Modulation of Ion Concentrations with Ion-Selective Membranes This is a collaborative project with the Han group at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is focused on innovation in basic neuroscience. We are developing a electrochemical nerve stimulation and blocking method using a microelectromechanical systems device ( Figure 1 ), which modifies local ion concentrations at the peripheral nerve surface ( Figure 2 ). 2. Perforator Identifi cation Using Near-Infrared Imaging Using a real time, light emitting diode-based imaging system to exploit invis- ible near-infrared (NIR) light for assessment of flap physiology, the perforator flaps were assessed with NIR fluorescence angiography using indocyanine green, an FDA-approved NIR fluorophore. This process permits patient- specific planning, image-guided creation, and intraoperative assessment without the need for lasers or ionizing radiation. We are currently looking at ways to quantify perforator flap perfusion and identifying vascular compromise. We have created two indices for arterial occlusion and venous congestion in which we are able to perform a cutaneous assessment that will provide information about vascular status. In addition, we are completing projects looking at the importance of perforator number, dominance, and location to flap perfusion. This collaborative large animal project is conducted by Bernard T. Lee, MD, and John V. Frangioni, MD, PhD, (Medicine, BIDMC). Near-Infrared Imaging For Intra-operative Assessment of Perfusion in Vascularized Bone Flaps Free vascularized bone transfers are a versatile and valued technique for reconstructing large bone defects resulting from post oncologic resections, trauma, infections, and congenital defects. However, vascularized bone transfers carry significant risks. Estimates in the literature of total flap loss after reconstruction are as high as 14%, with complication rates of 21-43%. Therefore, it is imperative that techniques are established to effectively monitor viability of vascularized bone grafts to improve surgical outcomes. NIR fluorescence imaging provides a composite intraoperative evaluation of perfusion in real time. This study was designed to investigate the ability of NIR fluorescence imaging to assess perfusion and viability of vascularized bone flaps. Assessment of Perfusion in a Partial Face Transplantation Model with a Near-Infrared Imaging System Composite tissue allografts (CTAs) have many applications in microsurgery including partial face composite tissue allotransplantation. Partial face CTA has recently been achieved in human subjects with success; however, signifi- cant risk of complications still exists with major concerns of tissue ischemia and rejection. As a result, it is imperative to establish techniques to effectively Figure 1. Microelectromechanical systems device. Figure 2. Confocal microscopy showing decreased ion concentra-tion around nerves (green signal outlined by the hashed oval). 124 | Beth Israel Deaconess Medical CenterPlastic and Reconstructive Surgery monitor the viability of transplanted microsurgical grafts in order to decrease the failure rate of composite tissue flaps. NIR fluorescence imaging system is capable of providing a composite intra-operative evaluation of perfusion in real time and has been shown to assess tissue perfusion. This study was designed to investigate the ability of NIR fluorescence imaging to effectively monitor and assess perfusion and viability on harvested partial face CTAs. Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging to Effectively Monitor Viability of Composite Tissue Facial Flaps New techniques are required to effectively monitor the viability of trans- planted microsurgical grafts. Because NIR photons travel deep into tissues (up to 1cm), optical imaging is capable of providing an intra-operative evalu- ation of CTA status in real time. Our team has developed and validated a novel NIR optical imaging technique using spatial frequency domain imaging for effectively monitoring oxygenation and assessing tissue perfusion and viability over a large field of view (18 x 14 cm). Clinical Pilot Study Using Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging to Assess Oxygenation of Perforator Flaps during Breast Reconstructive Surgery There currently exists no reliable method for passively monitoring tissue oxygenation and perfusion during reconstructive surgery. Standard of care still relies on the surgeon's experience to assess flap viability based on clinical signs, such as color, temperature, capillary refill, and bleeding. It has been shown that early detection of vascular complications improves the rate of flap salvage; therefore, newer methods that allow for a reliable objective measurement of flap viability are desperately needed. Our team has developed a novel imaging system using spatial frequency domain imaging to measure oxygenation over a large field of view (18 x 14 cm). Following validation on large animals approaching the size of humans, this imaging system has been translated to a clinical pilot study where perforator flap oxygenation was assessed intraoperatively. Clinical Research In 2011, the Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery worked on several clinical research projects, which focused on craniofacial and breast recon- structive surgery. Head, Neck, and Face Surgery 1. Real-time Intraoperative Computed Tomography Monitoring of Fracture Reduction The aim of this exploratory study was to assess the potential impact of real- time intraoperative CT scanning (xCAT\u00ae ENT) during surgical reduction of fractures ( Figure 3 ). 2. Outcomes Following Surgery for Skin Cancer of the Head and Neck The aim of this study is to evaluate contributing factors related to the devel- opment, diagnosis, and management of patients with skin cancer of the head and neck. A retrospective analysis of patients with skin cancer of the head and neck is being done. Skin cancer rate, clinical outcomes, and the various Figure 3. 3-D reconstruction using interoperative CT scanning. Department of Surgery Research Annual Report 2011 | 125Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery contributing factors related to development, diagnosis and management of skin cancer will be analyzed. 3. Evaluation of the Nasal Airway Using an Acoustic Rhinometer The aim of this study is to compare patency of the nasal airway before and after a procedure of the nose in patients complaining of nasal obstruction and in patients not complaining of nasal obstruction, and to correlate this with the patients' symptoms and data gathered from acoustic rhinometry. Breast Surgery 1. Evaluation of Plastic Surgery Outcomes in an Academic Medical Center In recent years, a significant body of research in the United States has focused on measuring clinical outcomes and improving quality of care in surgery. Such work is receiving heightened attention in our increasingly value-driven healthcare system. In this context, establishment of an institutional database for plastic surgery outcomes would be a valuable tool in assisting surgeons, patients and payers in choosing safe, effective, and efficient interventions. 2. The Outcomes of a DIEP Flap Program The newly developed DIEP flap program at the BIDMC is a financially viable program that increases utilization of breast reconstruction and improves outcomes and patient satisfaction. Specific aims of the study include: \u0081 Analyzing the breast reconstruction rate before and after the institutionaliza- tion of a sub specialized DIEP flap program at an academic medical center. \u0081 Comparing clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction with breast reconstruc- tion, before and after the institutionalization of a sub specialized DIEP flap program. \u0081 Calculating both the overhead costs of starting a DIEP flap program and the average cost of a DIEP flap. \u0081 Comparing costs of implant, TRAM, and DIEP flaps and analyzing the reimbursement schema for DIEP flaps. \u0081 Breast Anatomy and DIEP Flap Analysis A recent published paper suggested that the incidence of complications resulting from DIEP flap reconstruction of the left breast differed from that that of the right. This may be attributed to variations in their anatomy. The team will investigate and analyze factors that cause differences and variations in breast anatomy. The research will also assess the harvest times of the recip-ient vessels in the right breast compared to the left, as well as a comparison of the operating times for performing the microsurgery on each breast. 3. Post-mastectomy Breast Reconstruction after Previous Lumpectomy and Radiation Therapy: Analysis of Complications and Satisfaction This is an ongoing study in post-mastectomy breast reconstruction. Few studies have looked at the effect of prior radiation in the setting of breast- conservation therapy (BCT) on surgical complications and patient satisfaction with breast reconstruction after a salvage mastectomy. Our studies examine 126 | Beth Israel Deaconess Medical CenterPlastic and Reconstructive Surgery whether a history of BCT leads to higher rates of complications and dissatis- faction with subsequent breast reconstruction. As this topic is complex and ongoing, we continue to monitor and develop new research projects in this evolving clinical area. 4. The Outcomes of Breast Reconstruction following Partial Mastectomy This study aims to analyze breast reconstruction rates following partial mastectomy, comparison of clinical outcomes and evaluation of patient satisfaction as well as calculation of the cost of using different reconstructive techniques. A retrospective cohort analysis of breast reconstruction proce- dures following partial mastectomy is being undertaken. 5. Breast Cancer Recurrence Following Post mastectomy Reconstruction Compared to Mastectomy with no Reconstruction Continuing advances in breast reconstruction have provided surgeons with a multitude of reconstructive options. Concerns remain, however, about the effects of the various reconstructive methods on the ultimate oncologic outcomes. This study compares incidence, detection, and the management of recurrent breast cancer in a large series of patients treated with mastectomy alone or with mastectomy and various forms of reconstruction. 6. Impact of Complications on Patient Satisfaction in Breast Reconstruction The development of a complication after surgery can be difficult for both the patient and the surgeon. There is a growing body of literature that evaluates patient satisfaction after breast reconstruction; however, few studies directly focus on the impact of surgical complications on satisfaction. This study analyzes the effect of complications on general and aesthetic satisfaction after breast reconstruction. 7. The Impact of Nipple Reconstruction on Patient Satisfaction in Breast Reconstruction. Nipple reconstruction is an integral part of the breast reconstruction process. This study evaluates the effect of nipple reconstruction on patient satisfac- tion. We found that patients with breast reconstruction who undergo nipple reconstruction have a higher general and aesthetic satisfaction compared to having breast reconstruction alone. Patients should be fully counseled about the potential benefits of nipple reconstruction when undergoing breast recon- struction. 8. Complications in a Large Series of Breast Reductions Though there are currently hundreds of articles about breast reduction, there are no single group series of approximately 1000 patients. This will be one of the largest single group series every analyzed. The study assesses complica-tions and their associated comorbities. It focuses upon which co morbidities increase the risk of complications in this very commonly performed plastic surgical operation. Department of Surgery Research Annual Report 2011 | 127Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery 9. \"AirXpanders Patient Activated Controlled Tissue Expander System for Breast Reconstruction\" The research project evaluates the safety and performance of the AirX- pander Tissue Expanders System in women who are having or have had a mastectomy and plan to have immediate or delayed breast reconstruction surgery, and require tissue The study is designed to demonstrate that the AirXpander Tissue Expander System will perform the same function as saline expanders, stretching the skin and/or tissue of the chest wall to provide for permanent breast implants following mastectomy. Under guidance, it is hoped that the Expanders system will allow the patient to complete the expansion process at home. In addition, it will attempt to eliminate the connection between the external environment and the implanted device, and may reduce the risk of infection from repeated needle injections. 10. Silicone Gel-Filled Mammary Prosthesis Clinical Study In November of 2006, the FDA approved the use of silicone gel-filled implants with the stipulation that all currently enrolled patients continued to be followed through their five year cycle. The IRB-Approved \"Inamed Corporation Silicone-Filled Breast Implant Adjunct Clinical Study\" involves the collection of clinical data regarding the use of silicone mammary implants for reconstruction in both cancer and non-cancer patients. The studies have been closed to enrollment since November of 2006 and in September of 2011, we completed the follow up of all patients enrolled in the Mentor study. The Inamed Study is nearly its completion and should be closed by the begin- ning of 2012.

In all of our research, we have invited and incorporated the participation of medical students, resi- dents, and fellows. Members of both Samuel Lin, MD, and Bernard Lee, MD, research teams meet weekly to evaluate and report on current projects, to brainstorm new potential studies, and to develop research time-lines and strategies in moving the projects forward, including the formulation of presentations, abstracts, and original articles. Over the course of the year, research in plastic surgery has taken major strides in both organizing and participating in collaborative projects. Lin is now closely linked with scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (see paragraph below) and Lee is working closely with John Frangioni, MD, PhD, and members of his research laboratory (Medicine, BIDMC). Both ongoing projects are attempting to solve major clinical problems by applying basic scientific principles in order to develop new and innovative clinical applica- tions. Samuel Lin, MD, as Co-Principal Investigator of the project, with Ahmed Ibrahim, MD, and collaborators at MIT published an article about electro- chemical nerve stimulation and blocking in Nature Materials (right). Dr. Lin and this group were awarded an Affinity Research Collaborative (ARC) Grant by Surgery at BIDMC to foster this collaboration. Dr. Bernard Lee and team members, John Nguyen, MD, and Ahmed Ibrahim, MD, continue to work as a project team dedicated to research on reconstruc- tive microsurgery. Throughout 2011, the team has particularly focused upon near-infrared imaging to assess preoperative assessment of perfusion in recon- structive surgical flaps, flap viability, as well as oxygenation of perforator flaps in breast reconstructive surgery. This work, as it evolves, may lead to surgical breakthroughs in reconstructive microsurgery and surgical trans- plantations, including face transplants. Donald Morris, MD, completed two 5 year long IRB approved studies of silicone gel breast implants utilized in both aesthetic and reconstructive breast surgery. Over 300 patients were enrolled during the life of the study. One of the major ongoing accomplishments as a Division is our ongoing ability and commitment to recruit and work with young residents, medical students, and researchers. All faculty members are gifted mentors who are able to motivate, inspire and involve younger learners in both basic scientific and clinical research. This collaborative model extends to all of our work in the Division, including our ongoing fellowship programs: body contouring, aesthetic and reconstructive breast surgery, and hand/microsurgery fellowships.

Teaching, Training, and Education Undergraduate and Medical School Courses The Division of Plastic Surgery was active in teaching student clerkships and 4th year medical students for HMS course, SU514M.1, a course that Department of Surgery Research Annual Report 2011 | 137Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery was directed by Bernard Lee, MD, and Samuel Lin, MD. In 2011, we had 11 HMS student clerks rotate through the Division. Each student spent one month in the Division. We had hosted three international medical students who were on observational rotations. The Division was part of the Dept. of Surgery's elective rotation for two- week rotations of Harvard Medical Students, HMS III's. In 2011, we helped mentor three students. In addition to mentoring ongoing students, the Division sponsored several hour-long wound healing and suturing training seminars for each group of rotating students assigned to the BIDMC. Sponsored three postgraduate Clinical Fellows, four student clinical fellows and one high school summer research intern. Reena Bhatt, MD, 2011-2012, gave a talk on medical careers in plastic surgery to medical students at HMS. Peter Kim, MD, presented two formal lectures for second year medical students at Harvard Medical School. The presentations included one on \"Hand Anatomy\" and a second on \"Performing a Hand Consultation.\" Graduate School and Graduate Medical Courses All faculty members introduced plastic surgery residents and fellows, as well as surgical interns special challenges and approaches in microsurgery and working with surgical flaps. Residents, fellows and medical students are invited to participate on papers, abstracts and presentations. Drs. Lin, Lee, Miller and Tobias sponsored two educational sessions on non- surgical fillers. Drs. Lee and Lin sponsored and taught two head and neck cadaver labs. Peter Kim, MD, taught a hand and upper extremity cadaver lab, which included a practicum on Femoral Free Flap Cadaver Dissection. Peter Kim, MD,presented three one-hour lectures to Emergency Medicine Residents at Harvard Medical School. The lectures included: 1) Hand Anatomy and Performing a Hand Examination in the ER; 2) Upper Extremity Splinting Workshop; 3) Treatment of Facial Abscesses Drs. Lin, Lee, Morris, Tobias, Slavin and Upton all participated in the Core Curriculum and Journal Club of the Combined Harvard Plastic Surgery Resi- dency Program. Simon Talbot, MD, while a BIDMC Hand / Microsurgery Fellow, provided weekly tutoring sessions for three month to doctoral students in the devel- opment of biomedical devices, Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences ES227. In 2011, faculty members helped mentor thirteen EMED, interns, fourteen General Surgery Interns, six orthopedic interns, two podiatry residents, and 21 plastic surgery residents. We also sponsored four fellows: aesthetic and reconstructive breast surgery, body contouring, hand/microsurgery, and a post-graduate hand preceptor. In addition, we were also actively involved in training the BIDMC Orthopedic Hand Fellow and seven PGY 2 Orthopedic residents who were assigned to the hand services. 138 | Beth Israel Deaconess Medical CenterPlastic and Reconstructive Surgery Bibliography (January - December 2011) Peer-Reviewed Publications in Print or Other Media Research Investigations Bar-Meir ED, Lin SJ, Momoh AO, Tobias AM, Colakoglu S , Yueh JH, Slavin SA, Lee BT.

My main research focus is diabetes and its complications, with particular emphasis on wound healing and cardiovascular disease. Approximately 90% of my effort is dedicated to research, 5% for teaching, and an additional 5% for administrative and other relevant professional activities. I run my own basic research laboratory that mainly explores the findings of the translational research and tries to identify mechanisms that are related to the observed results. My laboratory works closely with Dr. Frank LoGerfo's laboratory and other laboratories in the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and is funded by NIH grants. I also collaborate with Dr. Mooney's labora- tory at the Wyss Institute and Harvard Engineering School; the main aim of our collaboration is the development of new wound-healing products. This collaboration has resulted in grant applications that are currently being considered for funding by NIH. Clinical (Translational) Research Translational research is the major part of my research activities. My work mainly focuses on the interaction between neuropathy and microvascular disease in the development of diabetic foot ulceration and the subsequent wound healing impairment. This work has been supported by NIH funding and nonprofit organizations. I collaborate with investigators from various departments of my hospital, the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and investigators from other institutions, such as the Brigham and Women's Hospital and the McLean Hospital, to conduct additional translational research. I conduct investigator-initiated research studies that examine the effects of various FDA-approved medications on cardiovascular function. These studies, although funded by the industry, have been conceived, designed and executed by my unit and focus on possible new mechanisms through which these medi- cations exert their beneficial effects. Finally, in the past I have served as the leading investigator and the leading author in industry sponsored multicenter trials that investigated the efficacy of new therapeutic interventions for the management of diabetic foot ulceration. My group is also interested in the etiology of diabetic foot problems and the pathophysiology of wound healing in diabetes. We are currently conducting a larger prospective study that will evaluate the role of microvascular dysfunc- tion in foot ulceration and wound healing failure. In collaboration with the Department of Radiology, we employ a 3 Tesla (3T) magnetic resonance scanner that can access metabolic activity through measurements of the concentrations and reaction rates of the high-energy phosphorus cellular compounds in humans by employing magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy methods. The main advantage of this technique is that it can give a direct non-invasive assessment of muscle metabolism. As a first step, we evaluate the effect of diabetes and its complications on the leg blood flow and metabolic function. In addition, in collaboration with Roy Freeman, MD, examines the natural history of the progression of peripheral neuropathy in diabetic patients. Finally, I am collaborating very closely with Atul Malhotra, MD, from the Harvard Center on Sleep Neurobiology and Sleep Apnea, to examine the effects of sleep apnea on vascular reactivity.

To achieve that end, I have pursued several complementary avenues of investigation including: (1) health services research, including large administrative databases, registries, and institutional databases; (2) biobanking pancreatic malignancy; and (3) deci- sion analysis and decision modeling. My investigative achievements have centered on building predictive models for pancreatic cancer and related diseases. Using large national databases, I have led research on current perioperative morbidity and mortality for pancreatic cancer and for pancreatectomy that are widely cited in the surgical and pancreatic cancer fields. Disparities in diagnosis, receipt of care, and outcome are among my active areas of inquiry. We have also used national data to build simple, widely applicable risk scores for pancreatic and liver surgery that can be easily calculated by hand or on a computer or handheld device (e.g. http://www.umassmed.edu/surgery/toolbox ). We have used institutional data to explore predictors of receiving all components of care; the learning curve in pancreatic surgery; the effect of sequencing options such as neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgical resection on pancreatic cancer outcome; and the application of major vascular resection in order to allow for more patients to have potentially curative surgery. With the eventual goal of integrating molecular information in risk prediction and determining best strategies for individual patients, I have established a novel pancreatic biobank, with whole blood, serum, plasma, and patient tissues, together with potentially biomarker-rich fluids such as pancreatic juice and cystic fluid. In collaboration with basic scientists, we have embarked on microRNA and proteomic profiling of these fluids to identify markers of malignancy as well as response to therapy. With Drs. Marc Schermerhorn (Chief, Vascular Surgery) and James Rodrigue, PhD, (Transplant Institute), I have been charged by our Chair, Elliot Chaikof, MD, PhD, to build a collaborative Health Services Research effort in the BIDMC Department of Surgery beginning in 2012.

We have been working to create research databases in these areas and, in collabo-ration with the medical and radiation oncology services, additional programs for hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma. I am also interested in applying tools from decision analysis to determine the best treatment options for patients with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma. Accomplishments in the Past Year Research Progress In conjunction with staff from the Transplant Institute, we have been working to convert our current clinical patient management system to a research-friendly data repository. We are also working with an industry sponsor to investigate a novel antibody that may aid in the prevention of delayed graft function in high-risk deceased donor renal transplant recipients. Individual Accomplishments During the summer and fall academic terms, I completed 25 credits toward my Masters in Public Health at the Harvard School of Public Health. I was also asked to review abstract submissions for the annual American Trans-plant Congress in the category of deceased donor kidney transplantation. I continue to serve as an ad hoc reviewer for a number of transplant publications. Invited Presentations I presented talks to the BIDMC Gastroenterology and Medical Oncology Divisions on the topics of liver transplantation and surgical management of hepatobiliary malignancies. Teaching, Training, and Education Undergraduate Courses I continue to lecture to the HMS2 class during their Gastroenterology Section on liver transplantation. Additionally, I hold a weekly tutorial session for a small group of HMS3 students during their general surgery rotation. We discuss core topics in general surgery, transplantation, and related specialties during a weekly case-based conference. Graduate Medical Courses I am responsible for the weekly transplant surgery rotation-speci c lecture for medical students, residents, and fellows on our service. Lectures I have created or revised include kidney, liver, and pancreas transplantation, living and deceased donors, acute liver failure, hemodialysis-access techniques, peritoneal dialysis, management of hepatocellular carcinoma, and management of bile duct injuries. I created a lecture for the general surgery resident curriculum on cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Amy R.

Evenson, MDDepartment of Surgery Research Annual Report 2011 | 167Division of Transplantation Research Focus Basic Research My current laboratory research effort is focused on the ability of carbon monoxide (CO) at low concentrations to be protective in rodent and large animal models of ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and delayed graft func- tion (DGF), allograft rejection and survival, and in hepatic regeneration. This work is in collaboration with Leo E. Otterbein, PhD, in the Transplant Insti- tute, one of the foremost experts on the biologic effects of CO. CO is a product of HO-1 action on heme and has potent anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and anti-proliferative effects. It is of great interest that the CO effects are observed with intermittent exposure, e.g., 1 hour per day. DGF is a common complication of kidney transplantation, occurring in 20%-50% of deceased donor kidneys, and is associated with decreased short-term and long-term function, decreased graft survival, increased risk of rejection, and increased costs. We have developed a novel kidney allograft model of DGF in swine that allows us to examine the ability of CO to prevent IRI and the resulting DGF, as well as acute and chronic rejection. We have shown that treatment of the recipient with intra-operative inhaled CO using a novel CO gas delivery system is effective in restoring kidney function more rapidly than in non-CO treated animals and accelerating the recovery of renal function post-transplant. We are currently determining the optimal treatment regimen (dose, duration, timing), studying whether CO treatment will allow longer cold storage time, what role O2 plays in the efficacy of CO, and importantly, whether treatment of the donor and the allograft will further limit DGF. We believe the mechanisms of protection in the recipient and donors are different with regard to the innate immune response to IRI. We are currently investigating the molecular mechanisms by which CO decreases DGF utilizing immunopathology and gene expression profiling using highly sensi- tive RT-PCR and Affymmetrix gene arrays. Data has shown decreased cell death and enhanced epithelial cell repair in CO treated animals with a likely component being more rapid recruitment and differentiation of stem cells. We have also shown that CO enhances rapid and early hepatocyte proliferation in mice after hepatectomy and importantly helps preserve synthetic func- tion. We have shown that the mechanism appears to involve a CO mediated increase in hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) secretion from stellate cells. The HGF generated binds to and activates cMet receptors on hepatocytes to accelerate hepatocyte proliferation through an Akt-cyclin dependent pathway. Further studies in a cirrhotic liver resection model have shown CO is able to down-regulate the increase in fibrosis that occurs in cirrhotic mice subjected to hepatectomy. These findings have obvious clinical application. Clinical Research The Center for Transplant Outcomes and Quality Improvement within the Transplant Institute has, as part of its strategic plan, decided to focus a sig- nificant portion of its resources and efforts on examining the role that health care inequalities play in determining access to treatment for chronic kidney disease and kidney transplantation (both living- and deceased-donor trans- plants) and how they influence post-transplant outcomes. We have reviewed health care inequalities in transplantation and, in fact, have identified areas where the field had overlooked areas of inequality heretofore not recognized. Douglas W. Hanto, MD, PhD Clinical Director, The Transplant Institute Lewis Thomas Professor of SurgeryAssociate Surgeon-in-Chief Staff Member Helen Snook168 | Beth Israel Deaconess Medical CenterDivision of Transplantation We found that there was significant information documenting the pervasive- ness of racial and socioeconomic disparities in transplantation, but data regarding other high-risk populations remained elusive. For example, there have been relatively few articles published reflecting age- and gender-based disparities. We found that additional criteria such as religion, housing status, immigration status, geography, and literacy should also be considered in future research of disparities in transplantation. Finally, while data surrounding kidney transplantation are sparse, the study of disparities in other fields of transplantation such as liver and pancreas has largely been neglected and we believe that future research should aim to paint a more comprehensive picture of disparities across the transplantation landscape, highlighting the most vulnerable populations and procedures. An important original observation is that one must design intervention trials that target not just one stage along the pathway to transplantation, but many dif- ferent stages to have a significant impact. We are currently utilizing social network analysis to examine shared risk between potential donors and recipients in a given network, clarifying the likelihood of finding an appropriate match through either direct donation or paired exchange. A detailed hypothesis paper was published in 2011 (see Ladin K; bibliography.). We are studying whether network factors explain low living-donor kidney transplantation among African-American patients. A second major project has been to better understand why blacks, who repre- sent over a third of patients needing transplants, receive just 13.4% of living donor kidney transplants. We have examined whether age, gender, marital status, family size, employment, education, functional limitations, blood type, hypertension, BMI, diabetes, health behaviors, psychiatric history, and dialy- sis type explain racial disparities in the rate of living-donor presentation and transplantation using a single-center (BIDMC) sample of 752 potential kidney recipients and 654 potential donors evaluated between the years 2004-2009. We found that black patients had a significantly lower number of potential donors evaluated and their rate of living-donor transplant or any transplant was lower than white patients. After 18 months, 47%, 21%, and 27% of white patients had at least one potential donor evaluated, received a living- donor transplant, or had undergone any transplant, respectively, compared to 31%, 6%, and 13% of black patients (p<0.001). Prior studies have suggested that if patient characteristics and distribution of commonly cited risk factors were similar for blacks and whites, disparities in transplantation would di- minish significantly. This hypothesis, however, had not been tested in the past. Using statistical methods not previously applied to this question that com- puted the counterfactual outcomes (if white patients had the distribution of covariates observed in black patient and vice versa), we have been able to show that 46% of white patients and 32% of black patients would have had a potential living donor evaluated within 18 months if the covariate distri- bution were reversed by race. This suggests to us that lower rates of donor presentation cannot be explained by differences in typical socio-demographic or medical variables and that donor factors may be more important than pre- viously thought. This paper was submitted for publication in 2011 (see Ladin K; bibliography). Douglas W.

Douglas W. Hanto, MD, PhD172 | Beth Israel Deaconess Medical CenterDivision of TransplantationDepartment of Surgery Research Annual Report 2011 | 173Division of Transplantation Research Focus The focus of my group is the study of allogeneic and xenogeneic (both fetal and conventional) islet transplants placed into cynomolgus monkey (macaque, Macaca fascicularis ) in novel anti-in- fl ammatory (cytoprotective) strategies as a means to enable immune tolerance and nurture resilient (\"cytoprotected\") islets to cure Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) in new-onset diabetics or in recipients of islet transplants. The major project in my group is to understand the molecular and cellular basis of tolerance to islet allograft and xenograft rejection. By necessity this includes an understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of diabetogenic autoimmunity. In particular, we pursue a promising new area for translational application to understand the mechanism and role of infl ammation in trans- plants. Our aim is to design new therapeutic and diagnostic approaches and test them in animal models. It is necessary to understand the overall effects of infl ammation from pro- to anti-infl ammatory models as a means to establish tolerance to islets in an autoimmune host. Thus we aim to follow extremely exciting data, concentrating efforts to cure diabetes through the prevention of islet graft rejection or recurrence of autoimmune disease. Infl ammation plays a critical role in determining the fate of allografts. To unravel the roles of graft in ltrating hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) should provide a new understanding of the biolo- gy of the allograft response given the knowledge concerning the crucial role of ILCs in governing infl ammation in other systems. There is essentially a \"mir- ror image\" system of helper T-cells and ILCs (including ILC1, ILC2, ILC17, and ILC22). preliminary data suggests, HSCs, particularly HSCs posi- tive for the orphan nuclear hormone receptor ROR gamma t (RORgt+), are closely related to graft in ltration by ILCs, at least RORgt+ ILCs. We know exactly when a transplant is placed and can detect the rapid appear- ance of intra-graft HSCs. For this we utilized RORgt indicator mice, giving us an unexpected view of LSK HSCs, including esoteric RORgt graft in ltrating non-T-cells. Yet the fate of graft in ltrating HSCs and the role or even pres- ence of graft in ltrating ILCs has not been well established. Our studies have focused upon RORgt+ HSCs, but we have yet to establish the exact phenotype of these RORgt+ILCs. Moreover, RORgt negative ILCs almost certainly will be found within these allografts. In essence, we will obtain a database that may allow us to characterize and then dampen detrimental infl ammation in its earliest stage before the advent of adaptive immunity and signi cant tissue damage. The knowledge and perspective to be obtained may provide invalu-able basic and clinical guidance in the eld of transplantation. One new, unfunded project in the lab aims to image islet transplants using \"color-coded\" T-cells. In this system, T-cell subsets express different colors and can be followed in vivo after islet transplantation. Using this system we have identi ed important characteristics of graft in ltrating HSCs and ILCs. The following represents a list of funded projects: 1. Tolerance induction for primate islet transplantation. 2. New strategy of tolerance induction in non-human primate islet allograft model. 3. Tolerance primate islet. 4.

Koulmanda, of Surgery Research Annual Report 2011 | 177Division of Transplantation Research Focus Research efforts in my group have undergone a transition from laboratory- based transplant immunology to clinical research. One current focus is the evaluation and follow-up of living kidney donors. We are interested in prac- tices in U.S. transplant centers regarding living donor evaluation criteria and are also interested in living donor follow-up. The latter was recently funded by the NIH to permit more detailed and long-term living donor follow-up at the BIDMC. Another research area of focus involves studies of immunosuppressive regi- mens in renal transplantation. We recently completed an analysis of the SRTR transplant database, which determined factors that predict bene t from IL-2 receptor blockade. This work was followed by an invited editorial in the Jour- nal of the American Society of Nephrology discussing the use of IL-2 receptor antibodies versus anti-thymocyte globulin. We are also interested in the use of sirolimus, particularly analyzing BIDMC data on converting patients from cal- cineurin inhibitors to sirolimus. This work generated a state-of the-art review article on the clinical use of sirolimus and another review article concerning the mechanism of action of sirolimus. We were also involved in an important analysis of the BIDMC experience us- ing donor-after-cardiac-death kidneys as part of a steroid withdrawal proto- col. We are currently investigating the BIDMC experience using low-dose anti-thymocyte globulin for induction and are exploring the role of continued immunosuppression in patients with failed grafts who are back on dialysis. I also serve as the site principal investigator for international multicenter trials of basiliximab, conversion from cyclosporine to sirolimus, the novel calcineu- rin inhibitor ISA 247, the novel Jak kinase inhibitor CP-690,550 and the use of ramipril for proteinuria induced by sirolimus.

Mandelbrot, MDDepartment of Surgery Research Annual Report 2011 | 179Division of Transplantation Research Focus My group focuses primarily on the gas molecule carbon monoxide (CO) and the potent therapeutic effects it has when used at low concentrations in mod- els of shock, transplantation and vascular injury. Our work stems from the study of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which has been labeled a protective gene. HO-1 genera tes CO endogenously as it catabolizes heme. More recently, we have expanded our studies to include biliverdin (BV) and more specifically biliverdin reductase (BVR) that converts BV to biliru- bin (BR). BV has been shown to exert potent protective effects in a number of in vitro and in vivo models with the assumption that it is the powerful anti-oxidant effects that underlie the mechanism of action. To address certain questions, we have generated conditional knockout mice for HO-1 and BVR allowing us to delete either gene in a tissue-specific manner. More recently we discovered that BVR colocalizes with Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) and regulates the response of the cell to bacterial endotoxin. Func- tionally, this interaction prevents the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and improves survival in a model of acute hepatitis in mice. We furthered these findings in a paper published in PNAS in 2011 where we demonstrate that BVR becomes nitrosylated and, as such, translocates to the nucleus where it binds to the TLR4 promoter to block expression. We con- clude that BVR is an innate regulator of the inflammatory response. Studies are now underway using the BVR conditional knockdown in macrophages in acute liver injury and regeneration. Figure 1 summarizes our recent findings with BVR. Biliverdin is now under pre-clinical evaluation for treatment of inflammatory disorders with a new biotech company Viridis Biotech for lead-ing the development. We also maintain a very active bacterial sepsis program, where we have shown that inhaled CO can protect mice from acute severe bacterial sepsis and shock. One mechanism by which CO provides protection is via enhanced activation of the inflammasome. This is evidenced by augmented caspase-1 activation and IL-1 expression as well as bacterial clearance in the peritoe- num. Shown in Figure 2 is our working model of inflammasome activation in macrophages treated with bacteria \u00b1 CO. Of note is that CO targets the bac- terium versus the macrophage, acting to drive ATP release from the bacteria that in turn activates the macrophage. We conclude that CO acts to sense the environment for the presence of bacteria. The binding of endotoxin to TLR receptors activates HO-1 as signal 1. The CO generated then diffuses into the environment and if a bacteria is present, ATP will be generated that acts as signal 2 binding to the P2X7 receptor and fully activating the macrophage to kill. Such a model, much like Tcell activation, permits a elegant system of in- nate inflammatory regulation, preventing unnecessary cell activation. We continue our work in models of vascular injury related to arteriosclero- sis, which leads to chronic rejection, as well as vascular trauma. We have elucidated that CO augments vascular repair via select targeting of calcium channels which lead subsequently to downstream activation of Akt and NO generation via eNOS. Further that CO enhances recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells to repair the injured vessel in mice. Inhaled CO is currently in clinical trials to improve kidney function after transplantation. Data generated in a large animal model was the proof-of- concept study that led to the clinical trial. Figure 1 Figure 2Leo E.

Robson, MD, PhD, FRCPDepartment of Surgery Research Annual Report 2011 | 189Division of Transplantation Research Focus My clinical research program has three primary objectives: (1) to enhance patient-centered outcomes in the context of clinical transplantation, (2) to characterize the outcomes of living kidney donors, and (3) to reduce disease burden and mortality by identifying effective strategies for increasing the sup- ply of organs for transplantation. Enhance patient-centered outcomes in the context of clinical transplantation The World Health Organization (WHO) has stressed the importance of a patient's subjective perception of life in the context of his or her value systems, goals, expectations, and standards when evaluating the benefits of medical or surgical intervention. Consistent with the WHO's emphasis on patient- centered research, we are conducting studies designed to help patients priori- tize their goals for transplantation and to make informed choices based on these priorities, to enhance provider-patient communication around patients' treatment preferences and goals, and to facilitate transplant providers' clinical decision-making. In other transplant-related studies, we are evaluating the effectiveness of behavioral health interventions to optimize self-management behaviors (e.g., medication adherence), maximize quality of life, enhance cognitive functioning, improve sleep hygiene, and reduce caregiving burden and distress within family systems. All of these studies share the common goal of reducing disease burden and optimizing transplant outcomes that are important to patients and their families. Characterize the outcomes of living kidney donors For adults with end-stage renal disease, kidney transplantation using a healthy living donor has many advantages over deceased donor transplanta- tion, including shorter or no dialysis exposure, immediate graft function, lower perioperative morbidity and mortality, better quality of life, and better long-term graft and patient survival. Indeed, living donors now account for nearly half of all kidney transplant performed in the United States. The trans- plant community and changes in federal regulations have brought attention to the need for more systematic study of living donor outcomes. The lack of such data is an important problem because, without it, the transplant community will continue to have considerable variability in informed consent processes for living donors and their recipients, as well as limited data to inform clinical practice and policy development. We have the most ambitious multisite, prospective living donor cohort studies ever funded by the National Institutes of Health. Currently in its first year, this cohort study will assess donor outcomes and their predictors over a 2-year period initially, with the intention of continuing assessments in subse- quent years to better characterize long-term outcomes. We are evaluating surgical, medical, functional, and psychological outcomes, as well as impor- tant secondary outcomes such as donation costs (direct, indirect), satisfaction, decision stability, and miscellaneous consequences (e.g., problems getting and/or maintaining health or life insurance) associated with donation. Additional aims of the study are to identify the donor, recipient, and center variables that are most strongly associated with living donor outcomes and to identify disparities (race, gender, age, income) in donor outcomes and factors that are associated with such disparities. We are hopeful that once these outcomes and their predictors are known, we can further develop and refine educational strategies and informed consent processes for both living donors and their James R.

Identifying eff ective strategies for increasing the supply of organs for transplantation The success of transplantation is limited largely by the extreme shortage of transplantable organs. A key part of my research program, therefore, is the empirical evaluation of methods to reduce the escalating gap between the demand for transplantation and the insufficient supply of organs. We are tackling this problem on several parallel tracks of scientific inquiry, with funding from the National Institutes of Health and the Health Resources and Services Administration. First, we have developed a community-based research partnership with the New England Organ Bank and the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles to evaluate strategies for increase organ donor registrations in the Commonwealth. Nearly all registered organ donors signed up in the RMV office or on their website, so this is an important portal for public education programs. However, fewer than half of all licensed drivers have registered as organ donors, so we are investigating the effectiveness of RMV clerk training, community outreach programming, and media-based interventions on organ donor registration rates. Second, donation after circulatory death (DCD) has been endorsed by the Institute of Medicine and the Health Resources and Services Administra- tion as an important strategy for increasing the availability of transplantable organs. In the last decade, while rates of donation after neurological death have remained stable, there has been a nearly 10-fold increase in the number of DCD donors. Although DCD now accounts for 12% of all deceased donor cases in the United States, its growth potential has not been fully realized because of process deficiencies, less favorable attitudes among healthcare providers, and lower rates of consent among family members. Consequently, we are initiating a multisite study to evaluate performance processes in poten- tial DCD donors at several medical institutions in New England, to charac-terize DCD knowledge and attitudes of critical care providers, and to identify determinants of family consent for DCD. We believe that identifying areas for improvement in the DCD process and the education of critical care staff, as well as a better understanding of the salient explanatory factors in the dona- tion decision will enable targeted interventions to be developed to increase DCD consent rates. Third, we know that minorities and low-income patients with end-stage renal disease receive live donor kidney transplantation at substantially lower rates, relative to Whites and those with adequate financial resources. We have iden- tified factors contributing to such disparities in living donation and are now evaluating a novel intervention to increase rates of live donor kidney trans- plantation in these disadvantaged populations. In a randomized clinical trial funded by the National Institutes of Health, we are evaluating the relative effectiveness of educational interventions delivered in an individual, group, or family home setting, with or without the presence of family members and friends. To date, the House Calls intervention has shown to be particularly effective at reducing many of the modifiable barriers faced by minorities and low-income patients who want to pursue the live donor kidney transplant option.

Rodrigue, PhD Accomplishments in the Past Year Research Progress In the past year, we have moved into the final phase of our House Calls study and I am now preparing an NIH competitive renewal. Our preliminary analyses suggest that a psycho-educational program delivered in the patient's home (i.e., old-fashioned house calls) increases patients' willingness to consider live donor kidney transplantation, yields more living donor inquiries, and contributes to a higher number of actual live donor kidney transplants, relative to standard care (i.e., education provided by physicians and nurses during a routine clinic visit). These findings essentially replicate what we found in a similar study we conducted in Florida several years ago. We will now evaluate the medical cost offsets associated with the House Calls inter- vention and evaluate its effectiveness using a peer-based educational approach. I am also developing a manual for the House Calls intervention, as it is now being implemented in two other federally funded studies and in The Nether-lands. We are in the first year of our multisite Kidney Donor Outcomes Cohort (KDOC) study. The start-up phase was lengthy and complex, since we are coordinating research activities across six transplant centers, 11 investiga- tors, three separate cohorts (donors, recipients, healthy controls), five assess- ment time points, and a new online data collection system. Despite the many practical challenges, we enrolled our first living donor participant in October and now have over 30 total subjects in various phases of assessment - with a recruitment goal of 720 participants. We completed one large-scale study in which we randomized DMV offices in Florida to receive either an enhanced organ donation intervention on-site (staff training, donor family volunteers, etc.) or simple placement of organ donation materials in the waiting room (i.e., usual care). DMV offices that received the enhanced organ donation awareness campaign showed a signifi- cantly higher aggregate monthly donor registration rate than those offices receiving usual care, controlling for baseline donor registration rates and region. We also found that donor registration rates dropped when we with- drew the enhanced intervention. Lower donor registration rates were signifi- cantly associated with DMV service regions with more minorities, less educa- tion, and lower income. We have since formed a strong research collaborative with the New England Organ Bank and the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles and have begin implementing a similar study here in the Common- wealth, with the explicit goal of increasing donor registrations by 25% across the state. We are making excellent progress on our unfunded studies as well. These include studies examining medication adherence post-transplantation, risk factors for alcohol relapse following liver transplantation, and long-term psychological outcomes after living kidney donation.

Through use of basic and translational sci- ence, we are pursing this goal. At a basic level, we are analyzing the molecular pathways that foster com- mitment to T-cell tissue destructive- and tissue protective-subsets as well as those that decommission such commitments. We have learned that T-cells adopt tissue-destructive or tissue-protective modes of action on the basis of cues present within the micro-environment in which they recognize foreign antigen. These cues largely relate to molecular texture of inflammation and inflammatory cells present within the antigen bearing micro-environment. We use this knowledge to design molecules and regimens that foster immune tolerance. In the absence of biomarkers to identify patients with impending rejection, decreasing or discontinuing immuno-suppressive therapy is fraught with dif- ficulty. To aid in the management of patients on standard therapy or deploy- ment of potentially tolerizing therapies we have also identified molecular sig- natures that are present in peripheral blood mononuclear cells well in advance of clinically evident kidney transplant rejection. The validity of this signature is now being tested in doubled blind trials. Area being developed for funding We have discovered a molecular pathway that directs a variety of immune and inflammatory cells into either a healing or destructive mode. Initial studies reveal that we can use antibodies to guarantee many immuno-inflammation cells adopt a healing phenotype.

Department of Surgery Research Annual Report 2011 | 201Division of Transplantation Research Focus My laboratory is focused on T-cell immunobiology, with an emphasis on transplantation and translational immunology. I was the first to demonstrate that T-cell costimulatory blockade could prevent allograft rejection and induce tolerance. These findings helped lead to the development of Orencia (Abatacept - FDA approved for rheumatoid arthritis) and belatacept (filed for FDA approval in renal transplantation). My work also established a paradigm shift in the design of tolerance-inducing strategies, by demonstrating that T-cell tolerance to transplants requires the death of alloreactive T-cells, and moreover that commonly used immuno- suppressive drugs inhibited this event. More recent work in my laboratory has focused on pathways that control PI3K metabolism, a key checkpoint in T-cell growth and differentiation. We recently discovered that Toll-like recep- tors expressed on T-cells function as direct sensors of inflammation, and that this T-cell intrinsic function is required for optimal immune responses and protection against pathogens.

We believe a deeper understanding of the biology driving these processes will help us design new approaches to treat human diseases of the kidney. Our work centers around two important questions: 1) what are the molecular components that guide the formation of new nephrons from kidney progeni- tors cells, and 2) what molecular pathways are active during the repair pro- cess after acute kidney injury? Answers to the first question will aid in design- ing a regenerative medicine approach, which is to use nephron progenitors to treat failing kidneys by inducing new nephron formation. To accomplish this we need to understand how nephron development occurs during organogen- esis so that we may encourage the same events in adult diseased kidneys and molecularly monitor the results. The second question is designed to identify potential therapeutic targets, such as signaling pathways, to promote kidney repair after organ transplantation. We view both these questions in the con- text of regenerative medicine. That is, to learn how to coax progenitor cells into new functional nephrons to treat failing kidneys, or enhance the recovery of surviving cells after an injury. We have been addressing the questions above using transgenic mice to perform lineage tracing and microarray profiling of distincT-cell popula- tions during kidney development and repair. This helps us understand the cell activities occurring in these processes and the molecular events control- ling them. Further, such mice permit us to examine the role of various genes during development and repair through functional analysis (e.g. using loss-of-function and gain-of-function alleles). Our work makes extensive use of transgenic mouse strains expressing fluorescent proteins and cre-recombinase in specific kidney cell populations. Using a Six2-GFP-Cre mouse strain I cre- ated in my postdoctoral work with Andy McMahon, PhD, we can culture em- bryonic kidneys with labeled nephron progenitors to observe and/or perturb nephron morphogenesis to learn details about this process ( Figure 1 ). We have also altered our traditional kidney explant cultures to adopt a low- volume explant culture technique (see Figure 2 ) recently published by the laboratory of Jamie Davies. We are using this culture system to observe how nephron patterning is altered when the Wnt and Notch signaling pathways are modified at later time points in nephron development. Taking advantage of existing strains, we are tracing the lineage of the Sim1-expressing cell population in the kidney. A Sim1-cre mouse strain was developed by Bradley Lowell's lab here at BIDMC for studies in the brain. Through our previous work, we had examined Sim1 and noted a restricted domain of expression during nephron development. We are now using this mouse strain to map out what mature nephron segments the Sim1-expressing population contribute to as the kidney matures ( Figure 3 ). Building on my previous work on nephron progenitors and characterizing the molecular anatomy of the kidney in the GUDMAP.org project, we have been performing expression analysis and building new transgenic tools to study cell activities in development and repair. In 2011, we designed and created three new transgenic lines to label specific kidney cell populations previously inaccessible to molecular analysis. These transgenic mice are designed to label the mature proximal tubule with RFP, and express an inducible form of cre-recombinase. These new tools will enable us to perform detailed analysis of the cellular events that occur during acute kidney injury. Further, they will also permit us to functionally test the role of signaling pathways in the repair M.

We are focused on the role of HO-1 and BVR in the pathogenesis of DNA damage, cancer, and inflammation-associated disorders. Together with Leo Otterbein, PhD, we demonstrated that HO-1 is a critical regulator of DNA repair pathways and hypothesized its contribution in cancer, premature aging and other diseases. These projects are currently ongoing in the laboratory. Further, we have uncovered novel properties of BVR functioning as a signaling molecule and mediating anti-inflammatory effects of BV. We continue to explore a role of BVR using our newly gener- ated BVR-fl/fl conditional knockout mice. Heme oxygenase-1 and carbon monoxide in DNA repair, cancer and aging Using biochemical and molecular biological approaches, we are working towards understanding how CO and HO-1 are implicated in the regulation of normal and cancer cells biology. Our preliminary data suggest that cancer cells maintain low levels of enzymatically active nuclear HO-1 which contrib- utes to malignancy, while application of heme degradation products or intro- duction of enzymatic activity of HO-1 drives cancer cell death ( Figure 1 ). Our data suggests that CO, at low, safe concentrations inhibits prostate cancer growth in a tumor xenograft model in nude mice by accelerating apop- tosis and inducing growth arrest, in part, through restoration of mitochon- drial respiration. Further, CO sensitizes cancer cells to doxorubicin treatment while preserving normal tissues, making it an ideal candidate for regulating toxicity to mitochondria. We propose that HO-1 and CO act on upstream mitochondrial pathways to modulate responses to chemotherapy based on the metabolic and genomic phenotype of the cells; activating repair/survival in normal cells and blocking repair/accelerating apoptosis in cancer cells. A focus of our study is the role of HO-1-derived CO regulating mitochondrial biogenesis, influencing oxidative respiration and blockade of glycolysis-driven proliferation and survival of cancer cells in the presence of chemotherapeutics. We are currently working with HO-1 conditional knockout mice to specifi- cally delete HO-1 expression in prostate epithelial cells as well as stroma cells (inflammatory cells) in TRAMP and PTEN/p53-fl/fl-Cre-probasin transgenic mice to test the role of HO-1 in cancer development and progression. Biliverdin reductase signaling during the infl ammatory responses We are studying the role of the bile pigments, which act specifically via BVR during inflammatory responses. We showed that BVR, acting as a receptor for BV, mediates its effects through Akt-IL-10 signaling to inhibit TLR4 expression ( Figure 2 ). Our hypothesis is that BVR is a major signaling molecule that is activated upon conversion of BV to BR and has potent anti-inflammatory effects in the innate immune system. We have generated BVR-fl/fl conditional knockout mice and we are currently testing evaluating cell specific deletion of BVR in mice models of inflammatory disorders.

Figure 3Department of Surgery Research Annual Report 2011 | 211Division of Transplantation Briefly, na\u00efve HO-1 knockout Hmox1-/- mice exhibit excessive tissue levels of H2AX while administration of genotoxic stressors or irradiation in HO-1-deficienT-cells resulted in loss of ATM/ATR and Brca1 induction with dysfunctional -H2AX foci and marked elevations in DNA damage. HO-1 induction or exposure to CO induced homologous recombination (HR)-medi- ated DNA repair through ATM/ATR. In vivo, mice exposed to CO, followed by a genotoxin (adriamycin) or radiation-induced injury led to diminished tissue DNA damage and improved survival. In this study, we characterized a role for HO-1 and the gasotransmitter CO in orchestrating appropriate DNA repair, and provide a mechanism for their potent cytoprotective effects in various pathologies. In continuation of our recent work with BV and BVR and stemming from our publication in JBC; 284(32):21369-78), we show that BV activates eNOS and NO through a calcium/CAMKK-dependent mechanism in macrophages (PNAS 108(46):18849-54). S-nitrosylation of BVR in to directs nuclear translocation of BVR and inhibi-tion of TLR4 via direct effect on TLR4 promoter. This mechanism is a novel addition to the anti-inflammatory effects of the bile pigments and BVR. To further dissect the role of BV/BVR, we have characterized our recently generated BVR-fl/fl conditional knockout. Our preliminary data suggest that myeloid-specific deletion of BVR (crossing of BVR-fl/fl to Cre-Lyz transgenic mice) results in a proinflammatory phenotype in alveolar and peritoneal macrophages. We are now exploring the role of the bile pigments and BVR specifically in immune cells as well as endothelial cells. Further, we continue to dissect the role of CO and HO-1 in bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitors and platelets following vascular injury proposed in my AHA funded project.

My interests span a broad range of disciplines that share the ultimate goal of identifying novel tumor antigens and mechanisms of immune tolerance to prostate tumor antigens, and harnessing such anti- gens and mechanisms to break immune tolerance for immunotherapy of prostate cancer (PCa). A major strength of the research strategy we use is the availability of humanized mouse models that allow speedy testing of novel vaccine formulations in a way that emulates the human system. We recently discovered a number of prostate tumor-associated antigens that represent promising targets for immunotherapy of PCa. To this end, we are currently optimizing strategies for inducing human HLA-restricted T-cell responses to the prostate tumor antigens (e.g. ERG, SIM2 and other anti- gens) identified by unbiased, genome-wide array and proteomic studies of clinical prostate tumor samples and derived, well characterized representative cell lines. By a stepwise approach of screening epitope targets in HLA-A2.1 binding studies, immunization of human HLA-A2.1 transgenic mice to identify immunogenic peptides, and active and passive immunotherapy in mouse models (including HHD/TRAMP/Pb-ERG triple hybrid transgenic mouse) to determine which of these peptides provide the most suitable targets for effective, human HLA-restricted, anti-tumor immunity in vivo. Coupling the targeting of such novel TAA with modulation of Tim-1 or androgen pathways, to overcome T-cell tolerance, is a rational avenue toward inducing effective, prostate cancer-specific immune responses. These studies are expected to lead to clinical trials of new strategies for prostate cancer immunotherapy. A new line of research in the laboratory is devoted to the molecular profiling of dendritic cell (DC) and T lymphocyte subsets in the context of prostate cancer, with the goal of unraveling key molecules that drive immune toler- ance to tumors. Our data show that a major shift in T-cell differentiation is taking place in the lymphoid organs following malignant transformation of the prostate. This shift is accompanied by major dysregulations in both transcriptome and metabolome of T-cells, and suggests possibility manipula- tion for an optimal modulation of anti-tumor immunity. A better under- standing of this shift at the molecular level might lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic agents to be included in vaccine formulations. Likewise, dendritic cell manipulation through their scavenger or toll-like receptors, using antagonist or agonist agents, seems to ameliorate the outcome of anti- tumor vaccines. Efforts at molecular dissection of DC biology in the context of prostate cancer are ongoing using the class A of scavenger receptors (MARCO and SRA-I/II) as a model system. Finally, we are working in collaboration with PIs from the BIDMC/Surgery, Johns Hopkins, and the University of North Carolina to target the highly prostate cancer-specific antigens ERG and SIM2 using peptide-loaded nanoparticles that are specifically directed to dendritic cells to induce cyto- toxic immune responses, and to evaluate synergy of concurrently enhancing the T-cell response component by overcoming PD1 and LAG3. This will be the first study to construct and use nanoparticle-targeted prostate cancer peptide vaccines in the preclinical setting and we anticipate this work will lead to a first-in-man trial of this strategy.Mohammed Simo Arredouani, PhD Assistant Professor of Surgery Lab Members Haydn Kissick, PhDLaura Dunn 216 | Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Urology Mohammed Simo Arredouani, PhD Research Support \"Targeting tim-1 to circumvent immune tolerance in prostate cancer\" Department of Defense, PC081107 06/01/2009-05/31/2012 PI: Steven P. PhD Co-I: Simo Arredouani, PhD Accomplishments in the Past Year Research Progress In our efforts to identify novel targets for PCa immunotherapy, we have used human prostatectomy specimens and the branched DNA platform to validate differential gene expression and have identified several promising antigens that are being processed for immunogenicity. This is supplemented with the use of specific human cell lines and mass spectrometry to identify HLA-A2.1- and HLA-DR-restricted, immunogenic peptides. Using various mouse models, we have performed gene expression profiling of T-cell and dendritic cell subsets in the context of prostate cancer. We have revealed important dysregulations in key pathways that drive cell activation and differentiation. T-cell differentiation is also investigated using in vitro systems to address gene expression and metabolic changes that drive T-cells to commit to specific lineages such as regulatory T-cells and Th17 cells. A better understanding of these changes will help identify drugs that could be used to manipulate immunity and improve vaccine outcome. After we have demonstrated that castration enhances cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) responses to prostate tumor-associated antigens, we sought to deter- mine the mechanisms driving this enhancement. Gene expression profiling of CD4 T-cells from prostate-draining lymph nodes of castrated mice showed a significant upregulation in IL-17 and IL-17R, among others. Increase of IL-17A and IL-17F was validated by RT-PCR. Treatment of immunized mice with IL-17 resulted in diminished CTL responses in WT mice and enhanced responses in a transgenic mouse of prostate cancer (TRAMP mouse). The enhancement seen in the TRAMP mice was accompanied by a drop in the number of regulatory T-cells. The mechanism leading to this interesting discrepancy is being addressed using a IL-17 KO mouse.

Multi-institutional Cancer Program Retreat, Ft-Lauderdale, | Beth Israel Deaconess Medical CenterDivision of UrologyDepartment of Surgery Research Annual Report 2011 | 219Division of Urology Research Focus Our basic science research focuses on studying and characterizing unique and specific human cancer stem cell molecules with goals to further understand and define the molecular make-up of a human cancer stem cell, to determine the molecular differences between cancer stem cells and normal cells, and to identify potential cancer stem cell molecules that may be targets for novel treatments for human cancers. Our model to carry out these studies is embryonal carcinoma in the form of established human cancer stem cell lines derived from human germ cell tumors. Embryonal carcinoma cells are the malignant version of human embryonic stem cells derived from human embryos and embryonal carci- noma cells are true pluripotent cancer stem cells, which can be induced to differentiate into non-stem cell cancer cells. Thus, embryonal carcinoma is an excellent model for studying unique molecules expressed by human cancer stem cells and also to study their function as both cancer stem cells and their differentiated non stem-cell cancer cells. Using this model, we have discovered a novel cancer stem cell marker in embryonal carcinoma called podocalyxin. Podocalyxin is a cell surface protein with very limited expression in human cells; it is expressed in subsets of blood cells and functions as a cell adhesion protein to allow blood cells to migrate into surrounding tissue (the spread of cancer within patients is thought to use similar mechanisms), and podocalyxin is expressed in kidney podocyte cells where it functions as a specific scaffolding protein to form large multi-protein complexes. Our identification of podocaxylin in human cancer stem cells was the first report of podocalyin in either human cancer or human stem cells. Since this discovery, numerous laboratories have discovered podocalyixn in many human cancers including breast and prostate cancers. In fact, these studies have also shown that podocalyxin is a marker for an aggressive phenotypic behavior of cancer cells. Podocalyxin has also been identified as highly expressed in embryonic stem cells further confirming the close relationship of embryonal carcinoma with embryonic stem cells. Our continued studies of podocalyxin have shown that it is the molecular carrier of the TRA antigens; TRA markers have been widely used for decades within the stem cell community to study human stem cells. The TRA markers have also been identified as potential serum markers for testis cancers. With the identification of podocalyxin as the carrier of the TRA molecules, studies can now be done to further the initial findings of the TRA antigens in human cancers and stem cells. Our current studies on podocalyxin are now focused in two directions; the first direction is to determine the function of podocalyxin in human cancer stem cells by identifying other molecules in cancer stem cells that interact with podocalyxin. We have identified six true podocalyxin-interacting proteins including a glucose transporter - the molecules responsible for supplying energy (glucose) to all cells. We are now characterizing the glucose transporter-podocalyxin complex and we are excited at the prospect of iden-tifying the first interaction between a glucose transporter and a cell adhesion protein. Indeed, in almost all human cancers, glucose transporters are highly over-expressed, but very little is known about the underlining molecular mechanisms that drive this process. The second direction with our studies of podocalyxin is more clinically oriented; we are exploring the expression of podocalyxin in human blood William C.

Clinical Research Clinical research is quite active and deals with diagnostic urologic oncology, sexual rehabilitation and qualitative analysis of urologic teaching. Our most active clinical research project is directed at the characterization of active surveillance as a management option for treatment of prostate cancer. Currently we have over 150 patients collected over 10 years and followed a strict active surveillance protocol refereed by a 20 core saturation biopsy technique performed every 12 - 18 months. We are currently gathering statis-tical data as to predictive indices characterizing these patients that progress vs those that do not progress. For example, those patients with a PSA density less than 0.085 seem to do well with a progression rate of only 20% over 8 years. Research Support Intramural Funding Urology Division, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Accomplishments in the Past Year Research Progress Basic Science In our research studies we have confirmed that the stem cell/cancer cell adhesion protein podocalyxin forms a specific complex with the glucose 3-transporter in human cancer stem cells and have published a research paper entitled: \"The Human Cancer/Stem Cell Marker Podocalyxin Interacts with the Glut-3 transporter in malignant pluripotent stem cells.\" Also, we have discovered a novel temperature dependent mechanism which regulates the differentiation of human cancer stem cells and are further studying this new regulation system. Finally we are investigating the use of podocalyxin as a specific marker for metastatic cancer cells. Clinical Our results regarding active surveillance were presented at the New England AUA Meeting. For this work the study population consisted of 111 consecu- tive patients who were prospectively enrolled with low risk prostate cancer with intent to cure from January 2003 to January 2009 by one urologist (WCD). All patients were followed with 20-core saturation biopsy tech- nique. The inclusion criteria were clinically localized cancer (T1c-T2), less than 3 positive cores, Gleason score 6 or less, and no more than 50% of core involved. The criteria for progression, and therefore treatment were: > 3 posi- tive cores, increase in grade (Gleason score >7) and > than 50% of any core involved with cancer. Patients were monitored with an office visit every 6 months and restaging 20-core saturation biopsy Radiotherapy were performed in patients who progressed.William C. DeWolf, MD W. Mike Schopperle, PhDDepartment of Surgery Research Annual Report 2011 | 221Division of Urology From the 111 patients who fit the entering criteria, 3 withdrew the protocol before an endpoint was reached. Therefore 108 patients were analyzed in the final cohort. The mean age of the study group at the time of the first biopsy was 62 years. The median time of follow-up was 25 months. The median number of total biopsies was 2 (range, 1-5). Ninety five patients had at least one saturation re-biopsy. The progression rate was 26% (28/108). Fifty one patients (54%) had a negative first re-biopsy. Of the patients who progressed 54% did so due to an increased number of positive cores. Univariate analyses revealed PSA density, using cut point the median value 0.08 ng/ml/ cc (p=0.0048), PSA velocity (p=0.01) and family history of prostate cancer (p=0.01) were predictors of progression. PIN and atypia were non predic- tors of progression. Most of the patients who progressed did so at second biopsy (17 patients). The median time to progression was 24 months. Of the patients who progressed 11 underwent RRP. Of those 10 patients (91%) had organ confined, low volume disease with negative margins, 4 had Gleason 3+4 and one patient had a T3b disease. Interestingly, 2 of 4 (50%) patients, who had Gleason 7 as criteria of progression on needle biopsies, had Gleason 6 on the final RP specimens. In our study PSA density, PSA velocity and family history of prostate cancer are predictors of progression in univariate analysis. Most of the first re-biopsies (54%) had no cancer. In the group of patients with negative first re-biopsy there was still subsequent progression revealing a 30 months lead time bias as noted by Kaplan Meier curves. Of the patients who progressed and underwent RP, 91% had a final pathology with organ-confined and low volume disease. In our setting AS with delayed intervention appears to be a safe and viable option in selected men with low risk prostate cancer.

Efforts to develop new biomarker targets for prostate cancer detection have been centered in the ongoing leadership by the Sanda Lab of the Harvard- Michigan-Cornell Prostate Biomarker Clinical Center, and NIH U01 that Dr. Sanda has led as PI since 2005. Among various accomplishments of the Biomarker Clinical Center over the past year was co-leadership and comple- tion of a national trial of PCA3 as a urine test to identify men at risk of prostate cancer. The Sanda Lab's research toward developing new prostate cancer vaccines was expanded in 2011 by establishment of a program to develop peptide vaccine for prostate cancer delivered by nanoparticles, funded through a prestigious, $1 million Challenge Grant from the Prostate Cancer Foundation (Sanda, PI). The BIDMC vaccine project includes collaborators at University of North Carolina (J. Desimone) and Johns Hopkins (C. Drake) and was the top-ranked proposal from among scores of projects submitted to the PCF Challenge Grant peer-review process. A notable milestone in the Sanda Lab in 2011 was establishment of an inde- pendent research effort by Dr. M. Simo Arredouani, who was promoted to Assistant Professor and continued to build his independent research program in prostate cancer immunotherapy after transitioning from his earlier role as Instructor in the Sanda Lab. Clinical Research The clinical research focus in the Sanda laboratory concerns prostate cancer clinical outcomes. These studies include the PROST-QA consortium, a national consortium of prostate cancer referral centers (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Cleveland Clinic, MD Anderson Cancer Center, MGH, UCLA, University of Michigan, and Wash- ington University) wherein combined evaluation of cancer control, satisfac- tion with care, and quality of life provides comprehensive characterization of prostate cancer care quality. This study, led by Dr. Sanda, has enrolled over 1800 participants, treated by over 40 physicians nationwide, and is the largest ongoing, NCI-funded prospective study of prostate cancer quality of life. Initially findings from the cohort had been described in a publication in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2008, and new findings to enable individualized prediction of sexual outcome after prostate cancer treatment were published in JAMA in 2011. Dr. Sanda also leads a national study funded by NIH to compare effective- ness of robot-assisted laparoscopic and open prostatectomy. The study is on track to complete accrual of 600 patients in mid 2012, and is the largest prospective study evaluating outcomes of robot-assisted surgery nationwide.

With regard to kidney cancer outcomes projects, we recently received seed funding to develop a multi-center project to prospectively evaluate patients following kidney surgery. In particular we are interested in short-term recovery issues after both open and robotic kidney surgery. We have over 400 patients in our clinical database and the last 150 have been evaluated prospectively using validated quality of life instruments. Pilot data from this work was recently presented at the American Urologic Association (AUA) annual meeting in Washington D.C. and has been submitted for publication. Our team has a high volume of advanced kidney cancer surgical cases and we are interested in recovery trends, particularly in the group needing cytoreduc- tive nephrectomy. By prospectively evaluating their health related quality of life we found most patients after cytoreductive nephrectomy recovered to near baseline HRQOL by 4 weeks postoperative. The HRQOL was measured using 2 validated questionnaires which were found to be sensitive to changes after surgery as displayed in Figure 1. This work will be presented by our team at the European Urologic Association annual meeting in Paris, February 2012. We are also interested in investigating cost-effectiveness of various approaches to kidney surgery ( Figure 2 ). We recently evaluated the costs of open, laparo- scopic and robotic partial nephrectomy at BIDMC. Our results demonstrated similar variable costs for all 3 approaches but increased fixed costs related to robotic equipment. The overall costs could be mitigated by improve- ments in surgical volume, time, and disposables. This work was also recently presented at the New England section of the AUA in Orlando, October 2011 and has been submitted for publication. With regard to robotic simulation, our team has developed a completely new method of simulating a robotic prostatectomy using inanimate porcine tissue (Figure 3 ). Our high-fidelity tissue based simulator is reproducible and allows urology residents, fellows, and attending surgeons alike to practice robotic surgery in a safe environment prior to operating on patients. A video of our simulator recently won first prize at the World Congress of Endo- Urology held in Chicago in October, 2010. We are currently validating this simulator in a prospective fashion by comparing performance among novice, intermediate and expert robotic surgeons.

We were able to analyze our pilot data of prospective evaluation of patient-reported quality of life after kidney surgery on the first 71 patients and submit this for publica- tion. Additionally we have now evaluated HRQOL and clinical outcomes in 42 patients after cytoreductive nephrectomy which will be presented at the EUA in Paris in 2012. We have also set up and transferred our data to a RedCap-based system which is web-based and allows for improvements in collaboration between institutions. Using this system we are able to follow clinical outcomes and prospectively assess HRQOL through web-based surveys We have completed a comparison of hospital costs associated with partial nephrectomy, the first such analysis, which has been submitted for publica- tion. We continued our validation of the robotic prostatectomy simulator and have neared completion of that study, recruiting 18 subjects to take part in a vigorous evaluation and validation testing.

OR supplies contributed greater cost for RPN and LPN than OPN (p<0.0001), while inpatient stay costs higher for OPN compared to LPN and RPN (p<0.0001). Sensitivity analysis of variable costs demonstrates that RPN and LPN can represent less costly alternatives to OPN if hospital stay for RPN and LPN is < 2 days and OR time < 204 and 196 minutes, respectively. Inclusion of fixed costs always made OPN less costly than LPN or RPN.

Wyers, MD Assistant Professor of Surgery Department of Surgery Research Annual Report 2011 | 235Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery Research Focus Our laboratory is focused on the development of biologically-inspired materials, devices, and pharmacotherapeutics based upon the principles of molecular engineering and nanofabrication technologies. Ongoing research is directed at the following: 1. Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine Engineering blood vessels: After decades of research, small to medium (4-7 mm) diameter prosthetic vascular grafts continue peri-anasto- motic intimal thrombogenicity, failure to develop an endothelialized lumen. A bio-inspired design, motivated by the molecular structure, supramolecular organization, and micro-structural architecture of natural collagen and elastin fiber networks establishes an important para- digm for the artery replacements of the future. Our research addresses this challenge on multiple levels: (1) We are working to determine the molecular features of collagen and elastin fiber analogues that influence the mechanical behavior and physiochemical properties of protein-based fiber networks. Elastin and collagen analogues are produced by biosynthetic and chemical schemes and processed into fiber networks by a range of micro-fabrication techniques. We employ both solution and solid-state methodologies to define essential material structure-property relationships of these materials. (2) We seek to identify the micro-scale characteristics of protein fiber reinforced biopolymer composites that dictate mechanical responses relevant to the design of an arterial substitute. This encompasses the study of the mechanical behavior of both single and multicomponent fiber network composites by static and dynamic mechanical testing under physiologically relevant condi- tions. (3) We are defining the morphological and structural remodeling of collagen and elastin fiber reinforced vascular constructs in vivo. Acellular constructs, as well as conduits seeded with living cells, are subject to investigation in relevant animal models. Specifically, we are interested in the effect of the local biological and mechanical environment on short- and long- term conduit properties, including patency and biostability. Materials for soft tissue repair: Although abdominal wall repairs are the most common class of operations performed by general surgeons in the US, results remain far from ideal due to chronic inflammation, poor integration of implanted biomaterials, and infection. In preliminary studies, we have developed biomaterials to serve as artificial fascia for the repair of abdominal wall hernias. These materials are generated from purified proteins and do not contain residual antigenic and inflammatory factors found in donor animal and cadaver tissue products. Currently, we are investigating the addition of various bioactive constituents, as well as the application of fabrication techniques to enhance our control over the patch microstructure. Our objectives are optimal integration with host tissue, rapid development of neovasculature, cellularity within and around the patch, and durability in the presence of bacterial infection. Cell transplantation: A major obstacle in islet transplantation is the high rate of primary nonfunction and early islet destruction, which has been observed after intraportal islet infusion, both in animal models and in clinical trials. Substantial evidence now suggests that an acute blood mediated inflam- matory injury is largely responsible for the observed functional stunning or destruction of islets and may well amplify subsequent immune reactions. Elliot L. Chaikof, MD, PhD Johnson and Johnson Professor of Surgery Chair, Department of SurgerySurgeon-in-Chief Lab Members Jeffrey M. Caves, PhD Erbin Dai, MDCarolyn A. Haller, PhDWookhyun of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery We postulate that molecularly engineered systems, including conformal barriers, anti-thrombotic fusion proteins, and heparan sulfate glycomimetics that limit inflammatory and pro-coagulant responses at the graft-host inter- face will reduce early islet destruction and, thereby, enhance islet engraft- ment. In dampening the early innate inflammatory response, a concomitant improvement in long-term islet survival may be attained by modulating the evolution of an adaptive immune response. 2. Vascular Biology Targeted therapies to promote vascular wall healing: The treatment of lower extremity vascular disease through the use of balloon or laser angioplasty, stenting, or atherectomy remains limited by a significant incidence of reste- nosis. Thus, new approaches that target thrombotic and inflammatory events, which contribute to restenosis and delayed vessel wall healing are required. We postulate that thrombin and purinergic dependant pathways can be inhib- ited by antibody mediated targeting of thrombomodulin, CD39, and CD73 to the site of vessel wall injury. Moreover, we hypothesize that nanoparticles produced from recombinant protein polymers will provide an effective mechanism for site-specific delivery of resolvins and their metabolic precursors that will further accelerate both the resolution of the inflammatory response and the reconstitution a func-tionally intact endothelium. As such, we anticipate that by abrogating early inflammatory and thrombotic responses, intimal hyperplasia will be limited after catheter-based interventions. Preventing and treating aortic aneurysms: The cause of an aortic aneurysm remains poorly understood and successful pharmacotherapy is lacking despite the role of aneurysms as a major source of morbidity and death. Unregulated inflammatory and tissue repair processes underlie the maladaptive response of the vascular wall that leads to aneurysm formation. Thus, there is great motivation for understanding the interplay between the complex biochemical, cellular, and biomechanical phenomena, which control inflammation and tissue repair in the vascular wall. We postulate that expression and shedding of the heparan sulfate proteo- glycan syndecan-1 may provide an important mechanism that inhibits abdom- inal aortic aneurysm (AAA) formation by limiting proteolytic or inflamma- tory activity and by promoting local reparative responses. The experimental approach within this project area is designed to yield fundamental knowledge regarding the regulated expression and shedding of syndecan-1, which we believe is an important molecular determinant modulating inflammatory and tissue repair processes in the vascular wall. 3. Chemical Biology and Materials Science Design of anti-thrombogenic surfaces: This project is directed at identifying and harnessing biologically inspired designs to limit blood clotting on artifi- cial surfaces. Thrombomodulin (TM), a transmembrane protein expressed by endothelial cells, is an established negative regulator of thrombin genera- tion in the circulatory system. We are utilizing molecular engineering and bioorthogonal chemistry to site-specifically immobilize a biologically active recombinant human TM fragment onto the luminal surface of small diam- eter prosthetic vascular grafts. In addition, we are developing computational models that describe surface induced coagulation events under flow as a design tool for this effort.Elliot L. Chaikof, MD, PhDDepartment of Surgery Research Annual Report 2011 | 237Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery Chemoenzymatic synthesis of P-selectin glycoprotein-1 (PSGL-1): Selec- tins (L, E- and P) are class of vascular endothelial molecules that play an important role in the recruitment of leukocytes to inflamed tissue. In this regard, PSGL-1 has been identified as the best characterized ligand for P-Selectin. PSGL-1 binds to P-Selectin through the interaction of core-2 O-glycan expressing Sialyl Lewis x oligosaccharide and three tyrosine sulfate residues. Some of the challenges associated with the synthesis of PSGL-1 are i) obtaining the hexasaccharide component with the Sialyl Lewis x portion in the peptide ii) synthesis of tyrosine sulfates in the peptide backbone. The Chaikof lab is currently investigating chemical ligation approaches to synthe- size these glycosulfo peptides and mimics that can pave way for studying their biological activity within PSGL-1.

Since infl ammation is critical to many disease processes, we are exploring therapeutic use of these genes or their bioproducts in vascular diseases including atherosclerosis, micro and macrovascular complications of diabetes, islet transplantation, liver injury and transplantation, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, among other diseases. This interest is based on our original nding that these genes serve a broad cytoprotective function in endothelial cells (EC). Expression of A20 (and other homoestatic genes including A1, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) in EC protects the cells from apoptosis and is potently anti-infl ammatory through blocking activation of the transcription factor NF- B, a key de ner of their homeostatic potential (Figure 1 ). While we usually study EC cells, we have expanded the work to pancreatic -cells, in which A20 retains its anti-apoptotic an anti-infl ammatory potential and thus is an ideal candidate to genetically engineer islet grafts for the treat- ment of type I diabetes. The speci c projects currently in the lab are as follows: A20 and Vascular Remodeling A20 serves an anti-atherogenic function in smooth muscle cells (SMC) via inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis of neointimal SMC. This translates into prevention but also regression of lesions of neointimal hyperplasia following balloon angioplasty of rat carotid arteries and protec- tion from transplant arteriosclerosis (TA), thanks to an additional modulation of the immune response, skewing it towards an immunomodulatory and away from a pathogenic phenotype, in a paper that was accepted for publication (Transplantation 2011, in press). This work received the Young Investigator Award at the American Transplant Congress. Extensive analysis of these in vivo results and of gene expression microarrays from A20-over-expressing and A20-silenced human SMC has identi ed novel targets of A20 in EC/SMC that help explain this positive outcome. Over- expression of A20 in EC and SMC transforms the molecular signature of the vessel wall to change its response to injury, in part through modulation of IFN signaling in SMC. This later nding was presented by Dr. Herwig Moll and won the Annual Surgery Research Award in the basic science category for Residents and Postdoctoral Fellows at BIDMC. Interestingly, we have also unraveled that high glucose/hyperglycemia decreases A20 levels in the vasculature of diabetic patients and animals. In response to high glucose, A20 undergoes unique post-translational modi - cations (PTM), i.e. the proteasome. Loss of A20's atheroprotective effect is part of the molecular basis for increased risk of atherosclerosis in diabetes. This work was recently published in PLoS One (see Bibliography ). In addition, A20 demonstrates anti-angiogenic function in retinal endothelial cells. Diabetes-related degradation A20 would signi retinopathy. mapping/mutating sites to generate a glycoslation resistant protein. Christiane Ferran, MD, PhD Professor of Surgery Lab Members Elzbieta and Surgery Intriguingly, A20 de ciency as seen in heterozygote mice seems to protect from the development of aortic abdominal aneurysms (AAA) by modulating differ- entiation status of SMC, through modulation of microRNA patterns. This work received the Excellence in Research Award at the American College of Surgeons Clinical Conference (presented by Dr. Scott Damrauer), and is being nalized for publication. The Hepatoprotective Functions of A20 We recently showed that A20 protects mice from lethality in models of acute toxic hepatitis, lethal radical hepatectomy, and prolonged warm ischemic time by promoting hepatocyte survival, protecting them from necrosis through a PPAR-dependent mechanism, containing infl ammation and unexpectedly promoting their proliferation by shutting down the cell cycle inhibitor: p21waf1 and also promoting IL-6 proliferative signals by shutting down SOCS-3. This work is accepted for publication in Hepatology. Systems Biology approach to further uncover the molecular basis for the pro-regenerative function of A20 in the liver demonstrated that its bene ts largely rely on optimizing energy production through improved lipid/fatty acid metabolism, and down-regulated infl ammation. This peutic non-alcoholic steatotic hepatitis (NASH), a hypoth- esis we will pursue. Interestingly, we have also unraveled in loss-of-function experiments, using A20 heterozygote mice (A20 +/-), of delays liver regeneration, and drastically increases lethality (50% lethality) following 2/3 partial hepatectomy, an otherwise safe procedure. These results are extremely important in light of the newly described A20 (tnfaip3) gene polymorphisms, recognized as susceptible loci for several infl ammatory and autoimmune diseases. Although A20 heterozygote mice are phenotypically normal, by interrogating the transcriptome we found subtle baseline differ- ences affecting lipid metabolism and circadian rhythm that could account for the drastic difference in outcome following liver resection. This work received an award at the ATC and is being nalized for publication. Additionally, we recently discovered that Hepatocyte Growth Factor upregu- lates A20 in renal epithelial cells and endothelial cells without promoting against infl ammation. These results could be particularly important for the design of preventive or pre-conditioning regimen that would limit infl amma- tion in many disease processes including prior to major vascular interventions and organ transplantation. This work will be published in 2012 in the Journal of Cellular Physiology. We are also working on de ning at the molecular level the intracellular targets that account for the function(s) of these proteins, and on establishing a structure/function analysis to map the domains associated with their different functions. In collaboration with Dr. Roya Khosravi-Far, we discovered that A20 is involved in the resistance of cancers to TRAIL and Chemotherapy. We have de ned mechanisms of A20-mediated resistance of tumor cells to death, which uncovered leads for novel anti-cancer therapeutics. The versatility of A20 functions in cancer is intriguing: its upregulation in solid tumors (glioblas- tomas) is a marker of malignancy, while its loss is associated with >70% of B cell lymphomas. Our overall goal is to translate our ndings to the clinic. We have engaged in some proof of principle large animal models of vascular remodeling and liver resection, with the hope that de ning speci c domains and targets responsible Christiane Ferran, MD, PhDDepartment of Surgery Research Annual Report 2011 | 243Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery for the function(s) of A20 and other homeostatic genes may allow the develop- ment of peptide-based therapies and drug-design strategies. Clinical Research on A20 Given our results unraveling a striking phenotype in A20 heterozygous mice upon challenge with liver resection and other models of vascular injury, we were interested to see whether A20/tnfaip3 gene polymorphisms could also affect the rate of liver regeneration in recipients of living donor liver trans- plants. Recently, a certain number of GWAS have identi ed multiple polymorphisms in the tnfaip3 region that associated with increased susceptibility to infl am- matory and auto-immune diseases. At least three of these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affected A20 mRNA levels or function. Accordingly, we collaborated with Dr. Elizabeth Pomfret at the Lahey Clinic to study in a pilot group the impact of A20 gene polymorphisms on liver regeneration in recipients and donors of living donor liver transplantation. Funding for this proposal was recently secured through the NIH. Genotyping living liver donors for A20 gene polymorphisms could be one of the rst reliable param- eters for donor selection, and for infl uencing the type of resection that could be safely performed (left lateral, extended right, full right or full left). It could also predict donor and recipient prognoses, and inspire A20-based therapies in liver transplantation.

Additionally, we have been successful in expanding our work demonstrating the bene cial effect of A20 in preventing intimal hyperplasia in model of transplant arteriosclerosis. Extensive analysis of these in vivo results and of gene expression microarrays from A20-over-expressing and A20-silenced human SMC has identi ed novel targets of A20 in EC/ SMC that help explain this positive outcome. Over-expression of A20 in EC and SMC transforms the molecular signature of the vessel wall to change its response to injury, in part through modulation of IFN signaling in SMC. This result set the basis for a fellowship grant proposal that was submitted by Dr. Moll to the Austrian Government, and has laid ground for a novel R01 proposal that we plan on submitting in the next few months. We discovered that partial knockdown of A20 predisposes to aortic abdominal aneurysms. This result is partially based on a novel effect of A20 on SMC differentiation. We are exploring the molecular basis for that and in particular the impact of A20 on TGF /BMP signaling in the vasculature. We have also expanded our work on the effect of A20 upon liver regenera- tion and demonstrated that this gene has the unique capacity to promote liver regeneration via decreasing the expression of the cell cycle brake p21waf1 but also through decreasing SOCS3 to improve IL-6 proliferative signals. This data is being revised for publication in Hepatology. As part of the liver work, we have also demonstrated that partial loss of A20 is a critical determinant of life and death following liver resection in mice. In other words, we unraveled a signi cant phenotype in A20 heterozygous mice facing injury such as liver resection. This was also true in models of proliferative retinopathies, and of transplant arteriosclerosis. These results are extremely important given the newly discovered SNPs in the A20 region that have been associated with decreased expression or function of A20 and increased susceptibility to auto-immune and infl ammatory diseases. Accord-Christiane Ferran, MD, PhDDepartment of Surgery Research Annual Report 2011 | 245Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery Christiane Ferran, MD, PhD ingly, not all of us are created equal for A20, i.e. in the face of diseases. To test this hypothesis in a clinical setting resembling our animal models, we have strated a collaboration with Dr. Elizabeth Pomfret at the Lahey Clinic to study, in a pilot group of recipients and donors of living donor liver transplantation, the impact of A20 gene polymorphisms on liver regeneration. Funding for this proposal was recently secured through an R21 NIH grant allocated to our laboratory. Based on the intriguing properties of A20 and its multifacetted mechanisms of action that hold hope for novel therapies, I have been asked to edit a book on the multiple therapeutic facets of A20, to be published by Landes Biosciences and Elsevier. This book is now well in progress with the help and assistance of Ashley Rogers, MD, who recently joined my group.

Specifically, I am focused on the role of purinergic signaling in the endothelium exposed to various insults, including pro-inflammatory factors, high glucose, or hypoxia, such as observed in diabetes or sleep apnea. Extracellular nucleotides play a significant biological role in many tissues and cell types as signaling molecules regulating cellular functions under both normal and pathophysiological conditions. They are released in tissue fluids and plasma in response to differenT-cellular stimuli and as result of tissue damage and cell death. Extracellular nucleotides exert their biological action via specific purinergic P2 receptors that are classified into two main groups: P2X, ligand-gated ion channels and P2Y, G protein-coupled receptors. We showed that in endothelial cells (EC) extracellular nucleotides initiate many important signal transduction pathways, including FAK, paxillin, and ERK, that lead to cytoskeletal rearrangements, increased cell migration, and EC proliferation. These data suggested the involvement of P2 receptors in regulation of angiogenesis and were further supported by the additional find- ings showing a connection between P2Y receptors and v3(5) integrins. Moreover, we identified a new nucleotide-induced signaling pathway of eNOS activation in EC that is calcium and PKC -dependent but does not require the activities of PI3K/Akt, AMPK or ERK. Importantly, this new pathway is functional in EC cultured under high glucose conditions, suggesting that extracellular nucleotides can override the damaging effects of high concen- trations of glucose, by maintaining NO bioavailability. We also elucidated a new pathway of AMP-activated activation by extracel- lular nucleotides in EC. AMPK is recognized as a key energy regulator and a primary protective kinase in diabetes mellitus. These data, complemented by our new results showing that extracellular nucleotides increase the levels of intracellular ATP, indicate that purinergic signaling might have an impact on metabolic diseases. Importantly, we examined our in vitro data in the animal model and confirmed activation of eNOS and AMPK in mouse aortas following ATP administration. Further, we demonstrated protective effects of ATP admin- istration in diabetic ApoE-null mice, and showed decreased expression of oxidative stress proteins and pro-inflammatory molecules in aortic arches, and attenuated steatosis and inflammation in the livers. Given the similarity in molecular targets of high glucose and hypoxia/inter- mittent hypoxia in the vasculature, we hypothesized that the protective effects of purinergic signaling observed in EC exposed to high glucose could also be pertinent to patients with obstructive sleep apnea. The R21 grant proposal aimed at investigation of the role of extracellular nucleotides in sleep apnea has been just awarded. I intend to use new results obtained in this project in my next R01 application this fall. I believe that others and our data documenting important functions of extra- cellular nucleotides in vasculature, strongly suggest that purinergic recep- tors may be new targets in treatment of diseases associated with endothelial dysfunction. My long-term plan is to investigate purinergic mechanisms in EC in the context of vascular complications associated with diabetes and sleep apnea.

Our prelimi- nary results indicate that in endothelial cells exposed to 1-4 h of intermit- tent hypoxia, the expression of several genes, including eNOS, VCAM-1, VEGF, A20, and selected P2 purinergic receptors, is modulated. We validated these data using skin biopsies obtained from sleep apnea patients and aortas isolated from mice exposed to intermittent hypoxia for four weeks, in collab- oration with Dr. Malhotra (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston) and Dr. O'Donnell (University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh). Moreover, we demonstrated that extracellular nucleotides may modulate intermittent hypoxia responses in EC. The data obtained in this study are the basis for two papers under preparation. We have recently demonstrated that extracellular nucleotides acting via P2 receptors upregulate expression of two \"protective\" genes, A20 and A1 in human EC. Furthermore, extracellular nucleotides activate eNOS, even under high glucose levels. The molecular mechanisms of these purinergic regula- tions of A20 and A1 expression and eNOS activation are currently under investigation. In collaboration with Drs. Gerasimovskaya (University of Colorado) and Yegutkin (University of Turku, Finland) we showed that extracellular nucleo- catabolism is decreased in vasa vasorum (VVEC) isolated from pulmonary artery adventitia of neonatal calves exposed to two- week chronic hypoxia compared to controls. Our data indicated that chronic hypoxia decreased ANTPDase-1/CD39 and ecto-5'-nucleotidase/CD73 activi- ties, leading to increased basal ATP and ADP levels. We also demonstrated a higher proliferative response to low micromolar concentrations of ATP and ADP in VVEC previously exposed to chronic hypoxia and enhanced perme- ability due to impaired vascular barrier function in these cells compared to controls.

Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis and Vascular Biology Meeting, Chicago IL; April 2011.Department of Surgery Research Annual Report 2011 | 255Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery Research Focus My large research group is extensively involved in four main areas of vascular biology research: 1) evaluating mechanisms responsible for prosthetic graft failure; 2) prevention of intimal hyperplasia (IH) in vein grafts; 3) developing and testing novel biomaterial surfaces for drug delivery, tissue engineering, and vascular prosthetic grafts; and 4) examining the role of neuropeptides in diabetic wound healing and heart failure. Prosthetic graft failure Anastomotic intimal hyperplasia (AIH) is the most common cause of delayed prosthetic arterial graft failure and delayed failure of vein grafts. As graft healing occurs, genes are either up- or down-regulated as compared to a quiescent arterial wall. We study altered gene expression that results in endo- thelial cell activation as well as cellular proliferation, migration and extracel- lular matrix production by smooth muscle cells, leading to AIH. Based on our previous work we identified two gene targets, myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) and thrombospondin-2 (TSP- 2), which are upregulated in AIH. Both of these targets are known to affect vascular cells. Our current work is focused on understanding the biology of these molecules and developing prosthetic grafts that can deliver silencing RNA (siRNA) to the vessel wall to silence these two targets and hence miti- gate the development of AIH. Results from these projects have been presented at several national and international meetings and have resulted in manuscripts. Intimal hyperplasia Similar to AIH, IH in vein grafts is responsible for vein graft failure. Using a canine model of vien bypass graft and advanced tissue sampling with laser capture microdissection (LCM) we followed simultaneously the tran- scriptome response of endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells of the vein wall at several time-points after graft implantation, compared with unim- planted control vein samples. This was followed with a systems biology analysis to define targets for gene silencing that are most likely to have the greatest impact in ameliorating implantation injury. This work has also been presented at several national and international conferences. Biomaterials Development and Testing The Biomaterials research we do in the lab is lead by Mauricio Contreras, MD, in collaboration with our industry partner, Biosurfaces Inc. In this productive collaboration, we have designed and patented new biomaterials that are ideal for drug delivery systems and tissue engineering scaffolds, and for vascular prosthetic grafts. Assembled through electro-spinning, these modified (polyester based) materials provide a unique distribution of highly porous networks of nanofibers that resemble the structural architecture of extracellular matrix, thus fostering cellular adhesion and improve overall healing. In addition, one of the great advantages is that while these materials are being synthesized, different biological/pharmaceutical agents can be incorporated into the biomaterial, such as antibiotics, antithroblolitic agents, growth factors (VEGF) to promote endothelial cell healing, or SiRNA to knock down gene expression. Upon release, these agents have been shown to maintain their biological activity. Furthermore, our electro-spinning tech- Frank W. LoGerfo, MD William McDermott Professor of Surgery Lab Members Mauricio A. Contreras, MDLeena Pradhan-Nabzdyk, Vascular and Endovascular Surgery nology is performed at low temperatures, unlike standard polymers which are extruded at high temperatures via melt spinning. Using this technology we have designed several new products that we have tested in vitro and in our in vivo models. Some of these products include: 1) a naonofibrous bioactive prosthetic sewing cuff for valvular prosthesis with fabric (polyester) in their design; 2) a bioactive prosthetic vascular graft for ventricular assist devices; and 3) a conduit for arterial localized gene delivery. In addition, we are in the process of designing new applications using this technology for infection resistant catheters and surgical sutures, as well as new prosthetic vascular graft for AV fistula access with self-sealing properties. Neuropeptides in wound healing The neuropeptide-diabetic wound healing research we do in the lab is lead by Dr. Leena Pradhan-Nabzdyk in collaboration with Dr. Aristidis Veves (Podi- atry). To study this area, we first developed important in vivo and in vitro models. Current findings from our diabetic rabbit neuroischemic model of wound healing suggests that in the skin of diabetic rabbits, the expression of neuropeptides such as Substance P (SP) and Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is down- regulated whereas the expression of inflammatory cytokines is upregulated. Neuroischemic wounds have the slowest healing rate and post-injury focused upregulation of cytokines is not achieved in wounds from our diabetic rabbit model. We have employed this model to test therapeutic efficacy of tempera- ture-sensitive hydrogels in collaboration with Lynntech Inc. (Texas). Based on the positive results of this Phase I study we applied for funds to carry-out a Phase II study at the NIH. Our in vitro studies using dermal vascular endo- thelial cells are specifically designed to monitor the role of neuropeptides in angio- genesis in a hyperglycemic environment. The results of this study suggest that hyperglycemia inhibits angiogenesis whereas SP and NPY both restore it. Similarly in dermal fibroblasts, hyperglycemia inhibits proliferation and migra- tion whereas SP and NPY restore it. All of these findings were published and presented at national and international meetings in 2011 (see below). In addition to investigating the role of neuropeptides in wound healing, we are also investigating their role in diabetic heart failure. Heart failure (HF) is a major cause of mortality in the United States, affecting nearly 5 million Americans and causing 300,000 deaths annually. Approximately 15 to 25% of patients with HF are diabetics and it has been suggested that diabetes may play an important role in the pathogenesis, prognosis, and response to treat- ment of HF. Advanced HF is related to marked insulin resistance. Coronary artery disease and cardiomyopathy are major causes of HF in diabetics. In addition, diabetes is known to cause both peripheral and auto- nomic neuropathy. The goal of this project is to investigate the role of SP, NPY and Calcitonin Gene Related Peptide (CGRP) in diabetic heart failure. Similar to our wound healing studies, we observed that expression of SP and NPY and their receptors are down-regulated in the right atrium of the diabetic patients compared to the non-diabetic patients. More importantly, the low ejection fraction correlates with reduced neuropeptide expression. Parts of these results are also published and presented at national meetings in 2011.Frank W. LoGerfo, MD Leena Pradhan-Nabzdyk, PhDDepartment of Surgery Research Annual Report 2011 | 257Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery Research CenterDivision of Vascular Endovascular Surgery Applications Submitted Pradhan-Nabzdyk, PhD \"Novel therapeutic approaches for foot ulceration\" NIH/NIDDK, R24DK091210-01 04/01/12-03/31/13 MPI: David Mooney, Leena Pradhan-Nabzdyk, PhD Accomplishments in the Past Year Research Progress Mechanisms of Prosthetic Arterial Graft Failure In the past year, we successfully published our results based on in vitro effects of TSP-2 siRNA treatment. In brief, the results indicate that, single trans- fection with TSP-2 siRNA allows suppression of TSP-2 protein expression for more than 30 days, does not affect human Aortic Smooth Muscle Cell (HAoSMC) migration or proliferation but significantly improves their attach- ment to fibronectin. We also successfully transfected and silenced TSP-2 in HAoSMC 3'modification of TSP-2 with cholesterol even in smaller amounts significantly silenced TSP-2 gene. Part of these results will be presented at Academic Surgical Congress, Feb, 2012. In collaboration with Biosurfaces Inc., we are developing electrospun (e) prosthetic grafts made of Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) polymer to which siRNA could be adsorbed. Our results indicate that HAoSMC attach signifi- cantly more and are more viable on ePET and ePET-ePGA combination graft materials compared to commonly used PTFE. PGA or Polyglycolic Acid is a biodegradable polymer and is used for slow delivery of biomaterials. These results were presented at the European Society for Vascular Surgery meeting in Strasbourg, France where Dr. Nabzdyk received 2nd place award as a young investigator. When grafts were dip-coated with siRNA, adsorption to ePET was also greater when compared to PTFE. Overall, siRNA adsorption to both grafts increased with siRNA complexed to and siRNA adsorption was greater Frank W. LoGerfo, MDDepartment of Surgery Research Annual Report 2011 | 259Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery in ePET compared to PTFE. Repeated dipping of ePET into siRNA also increased adsorption. This work was presented at New England Society for Vascular Surgery, Sept, 2011, Providence RI. We could successfully deliver fluorescently tagged siRNA complexed with PEI from ePET grafts to HAoSMCs either by placing cells on top of siRNA-PEI coated grafts (reverse transfection) or by placing siRNA-PEI on of HAoSMCs (forward transfection) and using confocal microscopy we could visualize robust growth of cells in both cases ( Figure 1 ). Moreover, we could successfully silence TSP-2 gene in HAoSMC by forward transfection method. This work will be presented at Academic Surgical Congress, Feb, 2012, Las Vegas, NV. Prevention of intimal hyperplasia (IH) in vein grafts About 250,000 coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG) and 80,000 lower extremity vein graft implantations are performed each year with an average cost of 44 billion dollars. Over 50% of CABG fail within 10 years, and 30-50% of lower extremity vein grafts fail within 5 years. Although some pharmacological therapies such as aspirin and dipyridamole, as well as statins have shown modest benefit in improving CABG outcome, there has been no corresponding benefit for lower extremity vein grafts. The primary objective of this project is to identify high profile targets for gene silencing to amelio- rate the injury associated with implantation of vein grafts. Canine femoral artery interposition bypass using reversed autologous cephalic vein grafts were harvested, along with contralateral cephalic vein controls, after 2, 12 and 24 hours and 7 and 30 days (n=3 for each time point). RNA was puri- fied from laser capture microdissection (LCM)-isolated endothelial cells (EC) and medial smooth muscle cells (SMC), converted to cDNA, and prepared Affymetrix 34-90% for ECs and 79-100% for SMCs. Our results demonstrate a robust genomic response beginning at 2 H, peaking at 12-24 H, declining by 7 D, and resolving by 30 D. Gene ontology and pathway analyses of differentially expressed genes indicate that implantation injury affects inflammatory and immune responses, apoptosis, mitosis, and extracellular matrix reorganization in both cell types. Through back propa- gation, an integrated network was built, starting with genes differentially expressed at 30 D, followed by adding upstream interactive genes from each prior time point. This identified significant enrichment of IL-6, IL-8, NF- B, dendritic cell maturation, glucocorticoid receptor, and Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells (TREM-1) signaling, as well as PPARa activation pathways in graft EC and SMC. Interactive network-based analyses identified IL-6, IL-8, IL-1a, and Insulin Receptor (INSR) as focus hub genes within these pathways ( Figure 2 ). Real- time PCR was used for the validation of two of these genes: IL-6 and IL-8, in addition to Collagen 11A1 (COL11A1), cornerstone of the back-propaga- tion ( Figure 2 ). In conclusion, these results establish causality relationships clarifying the pathogenesis of vein graft implantation injury, and identifying novel targets for its prevention. This work has also been presented at several national and international meetings and is currently being prepared for manuscript submission. Based on these data and data from the AIH project, we have started testing siRNA in vivo. The first target to be tested was MARCKS. IH was created in a rat carotid artery balloon angioplasty denudation model and saline, control Frank W. LoGerfo, MD Figure 1 Figure 2260 | Beth Israel Deaconess Medical CenterDivision of Vascular and Surgery Frank W. LoGerfo, MD or MARCKS siRNA were delivered without any transfection reagent or with PEI using distending pressure. At 5 days we get some IH development which is robust at 21 days. Preliminary data suggest that although we can effectively silence MARCKS gene (80% knock-down) using PEI, there is no reduction in IH development. This underscores our point that more than one gene needs to be simultaneously silenced to have a positive outcome. Base on our previous in vitro studies wherein we could simultaneously silence 3 genes, we are currently conducting studies geared towards silencing more than one gene in this in vivo rat model. Nanofi brous Bioactive Prosthetic Sewing Cuff Valve-replacement surgery has dramatically altered the natural history of valvular heart disease. Unfortunately valvular prosthesis with fabric (poly- ester) materials in their design, continue to be a serious problem due to infec- tion. Therefore, the design and development of a new bioactive (molecularly engineered materials) polyester sewing cuff, assembled through micro- fabri- cation (nanofiber) techniques, that would be anti-thrombogenic, promote/ foster cell healing and be infection resistant is not only necessary, it is well justified and warranted. To this end, we developed a novel nanofibrous sewing cuff with antimicro- bial (Moxifloxacin or Moxi) (recombinant hirudin properties was synthesized (BioCuff). Evaluation of physical (tensile strength and suture retention) and surface (SEM) properties between control and BioCuff sewing rings showed no significantly difference between these two properties. Release pharmacokinetics of Moxi and rHir under static and stringent wash conditions for 30 days was then evaluated, with both agents shown to be released at biologically-active levels over this time period. In vitro biologic activity (antimicrobial and antithrombin) of washed BioCuff materials persisted over the entire wash period, confirming a significant amount of each agent remained with the BioCuff after washing. Anti- thrombin activity from the washed BioCuff materials was also confirmed with the whole blood assay, which showed extended clotting times for the BioCuffs (greater than 6-fold) as compared to controls. BioCuffs also demonstrated superior antimicrobial, antithrombin and healing properties as compared to controls after implantation into subcutaneous pockets (with and without S. aureus) in the rabbit dorsum. Overall physical and biologic properties of the BioCuff did not change after implantation for 14 days as compared to unimplanted BioCuffs. Using our in vivo rabbit subcutaneous implantation model, all explanted BioCuff sewing rings had retained their shape and form after being subcu- taneously implanted in a rabbit for 2 weeks. Upon explantation, there was a visual difference between control and BioCuff sewing rings that had been challenged with S. aureus. Control sewing rings ( Figure 3 ) had gross signs of infection, as indicated by purulence directly around the sewing ring. In stark contrast, BioCuff sewing rings ( Figure 4 ) had no evident signs of infection and showed excellent incorporation into the surrounding tissue. These rings were removed from the same rabbit, indicating the sensitivity of testing two different materials within the same animal. No evidence of infection was seen with control or BioCuff sewing rings that were implanted but were not exposed to bacteria. Histologic examination of these cuffs confirmed the gross findings in that control sewing rings ( Figure 5 ) had a significant inflam- matory response with limited tissue incorporation compared to BioCuff sewing rings ( Figure 6 ). Figure 3 Figure 4 Figure 5 Figure 6Department of Surgery Research Annual Report 2011 | 261Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery Frank W. LoGerfo, MD A Novel Bioactive Conduit for Assist Devices Ventricular assist devices (VAD) are prone to two major complications: thrombosis and infection, resulting in significant morbidity/mortality. The high frequency with which these events occur is the impetus behind this research study, particularly, targeting the prosthetic vascular graft segments that connect to the VAD. Our goal was to create a new Dacron (electrospun) prosthetic vascular graft with antithrombotic and infection-resistant incorporating recombinant-Hirudin (rHir) as well as Ciprofloxacin (Cipro) and assess the release from this new bioengineered vascular graft in vivo (CCA) in a canine model. For this, test conduits (BioSpun-VAD or Hemashield) were used. Upon initial observation, the Hemashield conduits, were grossly flat, suggesting complete conduit occlusion. In contrast, the BioSpun-VAD conduits were patent, with the wall fully distended. Similar to the 60 day explants, there was increased capsular formation around the Hemashield conduits as compared to the BioSpun-VAD conduits. Histology was performed on patent specimens that were retrieved at 30 and 60 days following conduit implantation. The histology and immunohistochemistry results demonstrate that the healing that takes place on the BioSpun-VAD conduits is unique and different from other biomaterials implanted within the vasculature. Future Studies: Beyond this contract, future development of the BioSpun- VAD conduit would require additional implantations at 60 days in order to increase the power of the study as well as longer implantation periods (6 months/2 years). With these promising results, our next goal outside the contract is to seek out a strategic partner to further develop this new VAD product. Localized Gene Delivery from Implantable Arterial Devices The specific objectives for our STTR Phase II study were to: 1) synthesize control and MARCKS siRNA-loaded nanofibrous polyester materials, 2) characterize physical properties, 3) examine siRNA release and cellular uptake, 4) assess MARCKS siRNA knockdown of targeted cellular mRNA and protein expression in rat and human vascular smooth muscle cells, 5) implant control and MARCKS siRNA-loaded nanofibrous materials in rat carotid artery denudation 6) evaluate explanted arterial segments using histological, morphometric and molecular biology techniques. This research study is ongoing. Our study using surgical balloon EC/CCA denuda- tion and siMARKS-loaded nPET-PBT implants ( Figure 7 ) will be completed within the next couple of months, followed by histology and immunohisto- chemistry analysis. Neuropeptides in Diabetic Wound Healing One of the most debilitating complications of both Type I and Type II diabetes is the development of chronic non-healing foot ulcerations leading to severe morbidity and mortality. The cause of impaired wound healing in diabetes is multi-factorial and includes vascular, neurologic and inflammatory alterations. Impaired diabetic wound healing exists exclusively in skin areas that are affected by peripheral neuropathy and there is growing evidence that cutaneous peripheral nerves regulate immune and cytokine response via mediators such as the neuropeptides substance P and neuropeptide Y. Figure 7262 | Beth Israel Deaconess Medical CenterDivision of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery Our lab has shown that these neuropeptides not only control cytokine release from immune cells but also affect endothelial cell function. A previous study from our lab that employed the rabbit ear wound healing model has shown that diabetes affects the focused inflammatory cytokine response to injury and dysregulated neuropeptide gene expression but this study did not directly assess the role of vascular ischemia and neuropathy, two of the major contrib- uting factors of diabetes-associated complications. Additionally, we have developed a neuroischemic model of wound healing to understand the phenotypic changes and evaluate changes in gene and protein expression of neuropeptides, their receptors and inflammatory cytokines (Figure 8 ). In New Zealand White rabbits with alloxan-induced diabetes, one ear served as a sham and in the other ear we generated ischemia (ligation of the central and rostral arteries), denervation (resection of central and rostral nerves) or neuroischemia (ischemia along with resection of the corresponding nerves) followed by four 6mm punch biopsy wounds in each ear. Animals were euthanized ten days after wounding. Our results indicate that non-diabetic sham and ischemic wounds healed better than diabetic sham and ischemic wounds, with no such difference in neuroischemic and denervation wounds. Pre-injury, SP and NPY protein expression was lower and DPPIV, the enzyme that converts NPY into its angiogenic form, IL-8, CXCR1 which is the IL-8 receptor and IL-6 was higher in diabetes. Post-injury, the fold change over baseline in gene expres- sion of SP, NEP, the enzyme that breaks down Substance P, NPY and DPPIV was lower in the neuroischemic wounds in diabetes. SP protein expression was decreased and NPY2R was increased in the neuroischemic diabetic wounds. Morevover we see that the number of infiltrating immune cells are significantly lower in diabetic wounds irrespective of the type of surgical intervention. These results using a novel and relevant diabetic animal model, suggest that in diabetes, reduced expression of neuropeptides, a chronic-proinflammatory state and failure to mount an acute post-injury inflammatory response contribute to wound healing impairment. We used this rabbit model to test the therapeutic efficacy of temperature sensitive hydrogel from Lynntech Inc., through a formal STTR award we have with them. The hydrogels have thermoresponsive and biodegradable properties, with the added property of strong adhesion to cell surfaces. These are composed of PNIPAAM and poly Lactic acid-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) functionalized with GGGRGDS polypeptide units. The biodegradable blocks are incorporated into the thermoresponsive blocks to vary the degradability, biocompatibility, hydrophilicity, and mechanical properties. The incorporation of PNIPAAM provides the hydrogels with thermorespon- sive properties. Also, the hydrophobic behavior, which leads to chain collapse and aggregation of the PNIPAAM blocks at physiological temperatures additionally, provides enhanced exudate removal and entrapment to help keep the wound site fairly clean. The results from this study showed a significant improvement in the diabetic neuroischemic wounds treated with the active hydrogel compared to the control hydrogel. Data also suggest that the active hydrogel increases immune cell infiltration in these wounds. Based on these data, we have applied for a Phase II award. We are also using this wounding model in collaboration with investigators at the Wyss Institute at Harvard to develop new therapeutics for wound treat- ment. With this group the goal is to design bioengineered treatment modali-Frank W. LoGerfo, MD Figure 8Department of Surgery Research Annual Report 2011 | 263Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery ties for treatment of diabetic wounds. Currently we are awaiting a decision on a R24-NIH-NIDDK award in collaboration the Wyss investigators. The current in vitro project is directed towards understanding the effect of neuropeptides on fibroblasts exposed to hyperglycemia more specifi- cally on the migration and proliferation of fibroblasts. Our results show that compared to 5 mM, 30 mM glucose significantly decreases migration of Adult Dermal Fibroblasts (ADFB) at 12 and 24 hr (p<.01, and p <.001, respectively). Co-treatment with 100 nM SP to 30 mM D-glucose increased the migration of ADFB though not to the level of normoglycemic (5 mM glucose) pattern. Whereas, the addition of 100 nM SP to 5 mM glucose decreased migration of ADFB at 12 hr and 24 hr, suggesting a homeostatic role of SP. Although not significant, addition of 100 nM NPY to 30 mM D-glucose showed an increased trend in migration of ADFB. No statistically significant changes were observed with the addition of 100 nM NPY to 5 Mm D-glucose. Compared to 5 mM glucose, 30 mM glucose significantly decreased prolif- eration of ADFB by days 4 and 5. The addition of 100 nM SP to 30 mM of D-glucose increased proliferation of ADFB at days 3, 4, and 5 (p < .001). Similarly, the addition of 100Nm NPY also increased proliferation of HDFB at days 3, 4 and 5 (p < .01, p < .001, and p < .001, respectively). We also saw that hyperglycemia increases the protein expression of NEP, the enzyme that breaks down SP without affecting the receptor of SP, NK-1R in ADFB. Addi- tionally, hyperglycemia decreases the activity of MMP2 and MMP9 in ADFB, which cannot be restored by SP. These results suggest that SP has its effect on fibroblast migration via mecha- nisms other than affecting the activity of MMP2 or MMP9. Efforts are ongoing to further decipher the mechanisms by which SP and NPY restore the function of ADFBs exposed to hyperglycemia. Neuropeptides in Cardiac Complications We are also looking at the expression of neuropeptides in human right atrial tissue and human saphenous veins of diabetic and non-diabetic patients. Our published results suggest that gene and protein expression of SP its receptor NK1R and, NPY receptors, NPY2R and NPY5R, is significantly reduced whereas that of NPY and NPY1R are unchanged in the right atrium of diabetic patients compared to non-diabetic patients. The results from saphenous vein are summarized in Table 1 and indicate that the expression profile is the opposite in saphenous veins compared to atrial muscle of diabetic patients.Frank W.

LoGerfo, MD NIH T-32 Training Program Harvard-Longwood Research Training Program in Vascular Surgery (T32): Director: Frank W. LoGerfo, MD This training program is designed to provide two years of intense basic research training in vascular surgery for academic clinicians. The training program in its sixteenth year, addresses the absence of adequate research training for vascular surgeons as it applies to specific areas of clinical disease. Trainees pursue a program of research activity supplemented with course work in research design, ethics, statistics and evaluation of published research in the areas of molecular and cell biology, biomechanics, coagulation and thrombosis and angiogenesis. Clinically relevant problems such as atherogenesis, IH, prosthetic/host interactions and thrombosis will be the main focus of these research proj- ects. Trainees carry out their research projects under the guidance of a faculty advisor selected from 20 renowned vascular researchers based at four Harvard Medical School hospitals (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Brigham and Women's, Children's Hospital (Boston) and Joslin Diabetes Institute) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Upon completion of the program, trainees are capable of independent research and possess the scientific and research background needed to obtain peer-reviewed grants. Selection of trainees is based on candidate's demonstrated ability and career choice of academic practice. Applicants are resident physicians who have completed either 2/3 years of clinical Postdoctoral experience (surgical residency) or 5 years of clinical training (i.e. are board eligible). Only those applicants with career goals in academic surgery, with a keen interest in basic research in vascular surgery are compatible. Trainees in the program are not involved in any clinical activities unless research related. Frank W.

LoGerfo, MDDepartment of Surgery Research Annual Report 2011 | 271Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery Research Focus My clinical research group has an active interest in outcomes research on a local and national level. Our main interest is to compare outcomes after open surgery and endovascular surgery for a variety of vascular diseases, including aortic aneurysm, carotid disease, and lower extremity arterial disease, to help guide patient selection for each type of procedure. We have access to national data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (a 20% sample of all non-federal hospital admissions). This administrative database allows us to evaluate in-hospital outcomes after open vascular surgical or endovascular procedures in large cohorts of patients, representative of the entire nation, as well as allowing estimates of national rates of various vascular interventions (open and endovascular) over time. We have also recently purchased data from statewide databases that also include procedures performed without an admission to the hospital that may be missed by other administrative data- bases with only inpatient admissions. Since BIDMC is a participating hospital for data collection, we have access to the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data. These data consist of detailed and surgery-specific preopera- tive, intraoperative, and 30-day postoperative information with a specific risk adjustment variable for mortality and morbidity. Open surgical vascular operations as well as major endovascular operations such as AAA repair, TAA/A repair, and ruptured aneurysm repair are collected in this database and thus we can perform detailed evaluations of surgical outcomes as well as comparative analysis between open and endovascular procedures. BIDMC has recently joined the Vascular Study Group of New England (VSGNE), and in doing so we now have access to their regional, multi-institu- tional database. This registry consists of prospectively collected clinical data concerning open and endovascular treatment of carotid, aortic aneurysmal, and lower extremity peripheral arterial disease. Follow-up data is available to one year. Data elements include not only baseline patient demographics but also detailed intraoperative and perioperative information, making this a veritable wealth of information from which we can derive risk factors and outcome predictors. I sit on the executive committee and research advisory committee for the VSGNE. The VSGNE has now been adopted nationally by the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) as the Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) and will combine data from regional registries such as VSGNE. I serve on the executive committee for the SVS VQI, as well. Working with Bruce Landon, MD, from the School of Health Policy at HMS, we have developed collaboration with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and have access to data from all Medicare patients. Through this database we have access not only to in-hospital outcomes from Part A files, but with access to Part B files we can adjust for pre-existing conditions based on diagnoses made prior to the index admission. The use of part B files also allows the extra specificity and accuracy from CPT codes submitted by the treating physician, rather than ICD-9 codes submitted by the hospital coders. We also have unique identifiers allowing us to track long term readmission, re-intervention, and survival of patients after open or endovascular treatment. Collaboration with James O'Malley, PhD, from the Department of Health Policy at Harvard Medical School allows us to perform detailed statistical analyses, including propensity score matching of patients undergoing open or endovascular surgery. Marc L. Schermerhorn, MD Associate Professor of Surgery Chief, Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery Group Members Rodney Bensley, MDRuby C. Lo, MDRob Hurks, MDJeremy Darling, BA 272 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical CenterDivision of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery We also have our own database within our institution's vascular division with all vascular procedures captured prospectively. This allows tailored evalua- tion of comorbidities and various outcomes with physician chart review and angiographic review. This allows appropriate risk adjustment for various factors associated with choice of a given treatment strategy.

Schermerhorn, MD Applications Submitted and Pending Review/Funding \"Laparotomy related complications in Medicare beneficiaries\" NIH F32 (Mentor Marc L. Schermerhorn, MD) PI: Tommy Curran, MD Accomplishments in the Past Year Research Progress AAA Repair With access to the Medicare database, we have analyzed outcomes after open and endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms in the Medicare population. Our work has confirmed the perioperative benefit seen in recent randomized trials and demonstrated that these results may be generalized to the entire Medicare population. Additionally, we are the first to demonstrate that laparotomy related problems such as bowel obstruction or abdominal wall hernia require frequent intervention after open surgery, matching the need for aneurysm related reintervention after endovascular repair. With the Medicare database, Dr. Giles and I published a manuscript in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons demonstrating the differences between in-hospital mortality, 30-day mortality, and the combined 30-day and in-hospital mortality. Administrative databases often have access to only in-hospital data, which may bias in favor of endovascular repair given the shorter length of stay. We found that the absolute difference in mortality remained constant with each definition. However, the relative benefit of EVAR is overestimated when using odds ratios or relative risk with in-hospital mortality. We also showed that the period of increased risk of death after EVAR and open repair persists for at least 4 months. We evaluated 30 day mortality and late survival after reintervention and read- mission after EVAR and open AAA repair and presented our results at the plenary session of the SVS and published this in JVS. We also evaluated the volume outcome effect at the hospital level for EVAR and open AAA repair and I presented this at the New England Vascular meeting and it was published in Circulation . We found that while there is a relatively low volume threshold above which centers demonstrate adequate outcomes with EVAR, there is a continued improvement in outcome with increasing volume of open AAA repair such that the busiest centers have the best results. This may impact referral patterns and supports the concept of regionalization for open AAA repair. Dr. Bensley and I have recently submitted a manuscript to the American Surgical Association Annual Meeting and to the Annals of Surgery demon- strating age related trends in overall short-term AAA related mortality and AAA rupture. We found that patients <75 had a decrease in elective AAA repair and at the same time a decrease in rupture rate. However, in those >80 there was an increase in elective repair rate as well a reduction in rupture rate that was greater than that seen in the younger age group. We hypothesize Marc L. Schermerhorn, MDDepartment of Surgery Research Annual Report 2011 | 275Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery that the overall incidence of AAA may be decreasing and that an increase in elective repair in the elderly, likely related to the use of endovascular repair, has caused this greater reduction in elderly ruptures and short-term mortality. Using our institution's experience with EVAR, Dr. Bensley showed that ultrasound guided percutaneous access for EVAR is a safe alternative to cut down with a very high technical success rate that percutaneous failure is predicted by small vessel size. Percutaneous access has a high success rate as well as decreased wound complications when compared to cut down access. Contrary to prior studies identifying that sheath size was a predictor of percu- taneous failure, he has shown that it is actually access vessel size that predicts percutaneous failure. This data was presented at the NESVS annual meeting and has been accepted for publication in JVS. In a similar study, Dr. Hurks examined the benefit of percutaneous access in the ACS NSQIP database. He has shown that percutaneous access is increasing nationally, however, contrary to what our institutional data has shown, the benefits of percutaneous access are not being realized nationally. In fact, patients with percutaneous access were found to have higher rates of DVT. This manuscript is under review for publication in the European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Therapy. Dr. Hurks has also used the NSQIP database to examine cardiovascular outcomes after AAA repair. He showed that traditional risk factors do not predict myocardial infarction in patients undergoing AAA repair. Interest- ingly, he found that nonwhite race showed an increased risk for MI, which could reflect differences in medical management or unequal access to care. His results suggest that risk factors for postoperative MI are different in this patient group, urging the need for further research and better risk assessment. This will be presented at the PVSS winter meeting and submitted for publica- tion in JVS. Using the VSGNE to study gender differences in AAA management and outcomes, Dr. Lo has found that women are undergoing EVAR at higher rates than previously reported, although these proportions are still lower than for men. Additionally, women present at an older age, rupture at smaller aortic diameters, and undergo elective repair at smaller diameters. Thirty-day mortality is higher for women after open repair but is comparable after EVAR. This abstract has been submitted for presentation at the SVS annual meeting. Multiple specialties perform AAA repair Dr. Hurks has used the NIS to look at how the proportions of specialties performing AAA repair has changed after the introduction of EVAR. He has shown that vascular surgeons are performing an increasing majority of AAA repairs driven by the increased utilization of EVAR, and that the majority of repairs are performed by high volume vascular surgeons at medium and high volume hospitals. He also noted that there were differences in mortality asso- ciated with specialty, surgeon volume, and hospital volume. This abstract has been submitted for presentation at the SVS annual meeting. Dr. Sachs evaluated the change in rate of EVAR and open AAA repair in teaching and non-teaching hospitals over time as well as the ACGME resi- dent and fellow exposure to these procedures and found that general surgery residents now get minimal exposure to aortic aneurysm repair while fellows exposure to open repair has decreased but substantially increased for EVAR. This was presented at NESVS and published in JVS.Marc L. Schermerhorn, MD276 | Beth Vascular Endovascular Surgery Thoracic Aneurysm and Dissection Using the NSQIP data, Dr. Bensley has looked at the stroke risk of TEVAR with and without coverage of the left subclavian artery. He also examined if a left subclavian artery revascularization procedure affects this risk. He found an increased risk of stroke with coverage of the left subclavian artery and that a subclavian artery revascularization procedure did not decrease this risk if performed concomitantly, at a separate setting, or not at all. This data was presented at the annual meeting of the Society for Clinical Vascular Surgery and is under review for publication in the Annals of Thoracic Surgery . Using the same database, Dr. Bensley also examined outcomes after open TAAA repair in NSQIP hospitals. While TAAA repair remains uncommon, he found that the 30-day mortality rate was half that previously reported with the NIS (national administrative database) and approaching those reported at high volume single institutions. This was presented at the annual meeting of the SVS and the manuscript will be submitted to Annals of Vascular Surgery for consideration of publication. Laparotomy related complications after laparotomy and laparoscopy Using the Medicare database, Dr. Bensley is analyzing the rate of adhesion related postoperative complications after various abdominal operations. All abdominal operations were reviewed and grouped according to invasiveness into the abdominal and pelvic cavities. Outcomes analyzed were incisional hernia repairs, operative complications (bowel resection and lysis of adhe- sions), and nonoperative admissions for bowel obstruction. He found that major abdominal operations carried the highest risk of adhesion related complications and that laparoscopic operations carried the lowest risk. Abdominal wall hernia related complications carried the highest risk for inci- sional hernia complications. The risk for complications was noted to extend well beyond the perioperative period. This abstract has been submitted to the American Surgical Association annual meeting and will be submitted to the Annals of Surgery for consideration for publication. Lower Extremity Revascularization Dr. Lo used the NIS to show that in patients with lower extremity PAD, women present with more advanced disease, at an older age, and are more likely to be treated with angioplasty than surgical bypass. Though women experience higher in-hospital mortality, amputation rates are comparable and have continued to trend downwards for both men and women. Furthermore, the NIS shows a downward trend in the rates of endovascular lower extremity revascularization but subsequent analysis of state data suggests that rather than an overall decrease in these procedures, more are being performed in an outpatient setting. This has been accepted for presentation at the SCVS annual meeting. I was local PI for the Zilver PTX trial of paclitaxel coated SFA stents published in CCI showing improved patency with the drug coated stent. Carotid Revascularization Dr. Yoshida used the BIDMC vascular database to examine outcomes after CEA and CAS after stratification by high risk and symptom status. He found that current CMS high-risk CEA criteria place patients at an increased risk Marc L. Schermerhorn, MDDepartment of Surgery Research Annual Report 2011 | 277Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery for adverse events following CAS. This was presented at the annual meeting of the NESVS and will be submitted to JVS for consideration of publication. Dr. Hurks has used the state inpatient databases to examine the effect of the Present on Admission variable on outcomes assessment after CEA and CAS. It is difficult to accurately determine symptoms status and outcomes after CEA and CAS using administrative data as strokes can be coded with diag- nosis codes or with specific postoperative complication codes. The use of the POA indicator will allow us to more accurately identify symptoms present on admission to the hospital and strokes that are actual complications of their procedure. Using the POA indicator, he found that the vast majority of the diagnosis codes and a large part of the complication codes were present on admission. This suggests that these strokes were the indication for their inter- vention rather than complications. This has been submitted for presentation at the SVS annual meeting. Using the VSGNE database, Dr. Bensley has looked at gender differences in patient presentation for CEA or CAS. Prior studies have suggested that asymptomatic women benefit less from carotid revascularization. He found that a greater proportion of women undergoing CEA or CAS were asymptom- atic compared to men. However, the rates of stroke or death are comparable to randomized trials. This has been submitted for presentation at the SVS annual meeting. Dr. Bensley has also used the BIDMC vascular database to determine the accuracy of administrative data versus clinical data in outcomes analysis for CEA and CAS. He found that administrative data grossly underestimates the proportion of symptomatic patients, while overestimating the proportion of physiologic high-risk patients. The accuracy of administrative data was a paltry 56% when determining postoperative stroke complications. This has been submitted for presentation at the SVS annual meeting. Dr. Schermehorn published the results of the Gore flow reversal system for carotid stenting published in CCI as well as the CABANA trial, both demon- strating the efficacy of stent systems for treating carotid stenosis in high risk patients. Upcoming Projects Five abstracts have been accepted to the 2012 SCVS annual meeting. Julia Glaser will be giving an oral presentation on the fate of the contralateral limb after amputation. Dr. Lo will be giving a mini presentation on the results from the NIS on gender differences on the presentation, management, and outcomes of lower extremity peripheral arterial disease. Dr. Siracuse will be giving a mini presentation on prosthetic graft infections involving the femoral artery - a 10-year experience. Dr. Bensley will be presenting an electronic poster on isolated iliac artery aneurysms - management and outcomes in the endovascular era. Patric Liang will be presenting an electronic poster on the rise and fall of renal artery angioplasty and stenting in the United States. Additionally, 7 abstracts have been submitted to the 2012 SVS annual confer- ence. These include the results from our institution's registry of tibial angio- plasties performed for critical limb ischemia as well comparing the accuracy of administrative data versus clinical data in determining symptom status and postoperative complications with CEA and CAS. We also submitted 2 abstracts using the VSGNE to analyze gender differences in carotid revas- cularization and AAA repair, an abstract examined physician specialty and AAA repair and how the proportions of repairs per specialty have changed Marc L. Schermerhorn, MD278 | Beth Israel Deaconess Medical CenterDivision of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery after the introduction of EVAR. The final abstract involved the use of the SVS registry to identify which high risk factors predict adverse outcome with carotid endarterectomy and stenting. Proposals submitted to VSGNE's RAC committee include a study looking at the effect of protamine reversal on postoperative complications (specifically bleeding and stroke) and other outcomes following lower extremity bypass and carotid endarterectomy. Another project pending approval is studying gender differences in the potential cardioprotective effects of perioperative beta-blockade during and after major vascular operations.
