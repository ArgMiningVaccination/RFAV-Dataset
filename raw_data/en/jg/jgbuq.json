I made smoothies for the yoga students the other weekend to refuel after class and of course, I included some fat burning, energizing, immune-enhancing, beautifying coco oil. If you are a smoothie-lover like me, then I know you will love this recipe. However, what makes this recipe extra uberlicious is the addition of raw cacao which is raw chocolate powder. At little goes a long way and it's an easy way to get a mega dose of antioxidants. Raspberry Chocolate Smoothie Ingredients: - 1/2 cup frozen organic raspberries - Half banana - 1 tbsp raw cacao powder - 1/2 tsp pure vanilla - Spoonful of room temp organic coco oil - 1/2-1 scoop protein powder (Preferably a vegan soy-free blend) - Almond milk and water \u2014 use as much as you like, just depends on your preference for runny or thick. - 1 tbsp chia seeds (I always add these last so they don't get stuck to the sides of your blender Place all the ingredients into your blender for 30-60 seconds and enjoy immediately. Serves one - perfect for breakfast! If you are making it as a snack, cut the ingredients in half. "}
