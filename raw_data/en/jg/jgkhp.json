Depending upon the member's age, medical condition and location, the PCP choice may cover a variety of practice areas. This includes family practice, general practice, internal medicine, pediatrics and obstetrics. If the member elects to change the PCP assignment, the effective date will be the day the member requested the change.

Pregnancy Termination Services UnitedHealthcare Community Plan covers pregnancy termination if one of the following conditions is present: The pregnant member suffers from a physical disorder, physical injury, or physical illness. This includes a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself. This condition would, as certified by a physician, place a member in danger of death unless the pregnancy is terminated. The pregnancy is a result of rape or incest. The pregnancy termination is medically necessary according to the medical judgment of a licensed physician who attests that continuation of the pregnancy could reasonably be expected to post a serious physical or mental health problem for the pregnancy member by: -Creating a serious physical or mental health problem for the pregnant member or seriously impairing a bodily function of the pregnant member, -Causing dysfunction of a bodily organ or part of the pregnant member or exacerbating a health problem of the pregnant member, orChapter 4 Covered Services36 Arizona Medicaid, CRS, DD, LTC and EPD Provider Manual Confidential and Proprietary UHCCommunityPlan.com/UHCprovider .com Copyrighted by UnitedHealthcare 2018 -Preventing the pregnant member from obtaining treatment for a health problem. The attending physician must acknowledge that a pregnancy termination is medically necessary by submitting the Certificate of Necessity for Pregnancy Termination. The certificate must certify that, in the physicians' professional judgment, one or more of the above criteria have been met. Additional required documentation includes: A written informed consent must be obtained by the care provider and kept in the member's chart for all pregnancy terminations. If the pregnant member is younger than 18 years, or is 18 years or older and considered an incapacitated adult (as defined in A.R.S. \u00a7 14-5101), we require a dated signature of the pregnant member's parent or legal guardian indicating approval of the pregnancy termination procedure. When the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, documentation must be obtained that the incident was reported to the proper authorities. This includes the name of the agency to which it was reported, the report number (if available) and the date the report was filed. This documentation requirement must be waived if the treating care provider certifies that, in their professional opinion, the member was unable, for physical or psychological reasons, to comply with the requirement. Except in cases of medical emergencies, you must get prior authorization for all covered pregnancy terminations from the UnitedHealthcare Community Plan medical director or designee. A completed Certificate of Necessity for Pregnancy Termination and Verification of Diagnosis by Contractor for Pregnancy Termination Requests must be submitted with the prior authorization request. The certificates can be obtained online at azAHCCCS.gov , from the AHCCCS Medical Policy Manual, Chapter 400, Exhibit 410-4 and 410-5. In cases of medical emergencies, you must submit all documentation of medical necessity to UnitedHealthcare Community Plan within two working days of the date on which the pregnancy termination procedure was performed. Sterilization You must comply with the following requirements before performing sterilization. Prior authorization is not required unless the member is younger than 21 years. Sterilization of a member of this age must be medically necessary. A completed Federal Consent Form must be submitted with claims for all voluntary sterilization procedures. Consent requirements require: The recipient to be at least 21 years old at the time of consent is signed. The recipient to be mentally competent. Consent is to be voluntary and obtained without duress. 30, but not more than 180, days have passed between the date of informed consent and the date of sterilization, except in the case of a premature delivery or emergency abdominal surgery. Members may consent to be sterilized at the time of a premature delivery or emergency abdominal surgery, if at least 72 hours have passed since they gave informed consent. In the case of premature delivery, the informed consent must have been given at least 30 days before the expected date of delivery. A copy of the signed Federal Consent Form must be submitted by each care provider involved with the hospitalization and/or sterilization. A witness present when the consent is obtained. Suitable arrangements must be made to help ensure the information in the consent form is effectively communicated to members with limited English proficiency or reading skills as well as those with visual and/or auditory limitations. Before signing the consent form, the member must first have been offered factual information, including: -Answers to questions about the specific procedure to be performed. -Notification that withdrawal of consent can occur at any time before surgery without affecting future care and/or loss of federally funded program benefits. -A description of available alternative methods -A full description of the discomforts and risks that may accompany or follow the performing of the procedure. This includes an explanation of the type and possible effects of any anesthetic to be used. -A full description of the advantages of disadvantages that may be expected. -Notification that sterilization cannot be performed for at least 30 days after consent. -That sterilization consent may not be obtained when an eligible member: Is in labor or childbirth. Is seeking to obtain or obtaining a pregnancy termination. Is under the influence of alcohol or other substances that affect their awareness.

This approach helps ensure our members receive the right care in the right setting at the right time. The prior authorization process assists in meeting this goal. You are required to coordinate member care within our care provider network. When possible, all health plan member referrals should be directed to participating care providers. Referrals outside of the network are permitted with prior authorization approval from us. The prior authorization process is one of the tools we use to monitor the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the services our members receive. Prior authorization allows us to evaluate services for continuity of care, benefit coverage under applicable program guidelines and policies, and cost efficiency before services are rendered. Participating and non-contracted health professionals, hospitals, and other care providers are required to comply with prior authorization policies and procedures. Noncompliance may result in delay or denial of reimbursement. Unless another department or unit has been specially designated to authorize a service, prior authorization requests are routed through the Prior Authorization Intake department. Department nurses and medical directors are available 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., local time. Requests can be made by phone, fax or online. General Referral Information PCPs generally coordinate referrals of members for medically necessary services beyond the scope of their practice. However, specialists and ancillary care providers may request prior authorization for services within their specialty areas. The requestor monitors the progress of referred members' care and see that members are returned to their care when medically appropriate. Services that do not require PCP interaction are: Participating vision providers Participating dentists Participating radiologists Female members who self-refer for their well-woman exam Behavioral health services (refer to Chapter 9)While a referral is not required for behavioral health services, PCPs must consult with the member's behavioral health care providers regarding the member's treatment plan. Our behavioral health care coordinators and medical directors are available for consultation regarding the guidelines. You may sometimes receive requests for prescription refill orders, orders for DME and referrals for specialty care. When a case manager reaches out to an office and requests one of the above items, the office needs to respond as quickly as possible and provide the requested information. Services that Require Prior Authorization for Acute and Dual Complete/One Programs All services rendered by a non-participating care provider require authorization and must have supporting documentation to support the requests. All out-of-state services require authorization with medical documentation to support the request. Any service considered experimental or investigational is not a covered benefit. The following directives apply to all prior authorization requests: The member must be eligible at the time the covered service is rendered. Authorization is not a guarantee of payment. Billing guidelines must be met. All rendering care providers/facilities/vendors must be actively registered with AHCCCS. Important Reminders All services must be a covered benefit as outlined by AHCCCS. All authorization requests may be submitted on UHCprovider.com, by phone or fax. Instructions for submitting prior authorization requests are available online at UHCCommunityPlan.com.39 Arizona Medicaid, CRS, DD, LTC and EPD Provider Manual Confidential and Proprietary UHCCommunityPlan.com/UHCprovider .com Copyrighted by UnitedHealthcare 2018Chapter 5 Medical Management Important Phone Numbers Member Services Available 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Local time, Mon - Fri800-348-4058 TTY Hearing Impaired 800-367-8939 Provider Services Available 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Local time, Mon - Fri800-445-1638 UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete/One Medicare Member Services Available 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Local time, Mon - Fri877-614-0623TTY Hearing Impaired 800-842-4681 ALTCS EPD Provider Services Available 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Local time, Mon - Fri800-377-2055 General Fax: 855-465-3075 Requesting Prior Authorization Use the following steps to obtain prior authorization: Direct requests to UnitedHealthcare Community Plan's Prior Authorization Prior Authorization at 800-377-2055. -Complete the prior authorization form, if applicable, available on UHCprovider.com and fax to 888-899-1499. All requests require: -A valid member ID number. -Name of referring care provider. -Name of servicing care provider. -The current applicable CPT, ICD-10 and HCPCS codes for the services being requested. -The designated place of service. The Prior Authorization department documents and evaluates requests. It checks: The member is enrolled with the health plan at the time of the request and on each date of service. The requested service is a covered benefit. The service is medically necessity and appropriate, using national medical review criteria based on AHCCCS program requirements, applicable policies and procedure, contracts and law. The service is being provided by a participating care provider and in the appropriate setting. Other insurance for coordination of benefits should handle the request first. Responding to Prior Authorization Requests The UnitedHealthcare Community Plan Pre-Service Review Team makes determinations and will notify requesters of approval or denial of authorization within the AHCCCS regulatory requirements: STANDARD Request (i.e., elective/routine/non-urgent) - A decision and notification is made no later than 14 calendar days following the receipt of the request. This time frame may be extended up to 14 days if the member or care provider requests an extension or if more information is needed and the delay is the member's best interest. EXPEDITED Request (i.e., Urgent/STAT) - These requests should ONLY be made when the standard timeframe could seriously jeopardize the member's life, health, or ability to attain, maintain or regain maximum function. A decision and notification will be made no later than 72 hours following the receipt of the request, with a possible extended up to 14 days if the member or care provider requests an extension or if more information is needed and the delay is in the member's best interest. Prior Authorization Denials Denial of authorization requests for medical necessity occurs only after a UnitedHealthcare Community Plan medical director has reviewed the request and determines that the service does not meet criteria. You may speak with a medical director to discuss the decision. Requests are often denied because they lack supporting medical documentation. If more information is requested and not received within the designated time frame, the request may be denied. You can submit additional medical records after receiving a denial of a service request. A new case will be entered into the prior authorization system for review with the supporting documentation. Period of Referral Authorization Referrals and prior authorizations are valid only if the member is enrolled with the health plan on the date of the service delivery. Paper referrals are generally valid for 60 calendar days, beginning with the date the referring care provider signed and dated the referral. However, if the referral covers a consultation or procedure that requires prior authorization, you must perform the consultation or procedure within three days before after the date(s) of service is authorized. If prior authorization is required, please call to verify the prior authorization number and the date(s) of service authorized. Exceptions include: 120 days of continued care. Hematologist/oncologist, radiation oncology, gynecology oncology and allergy referrals are valid for 180 days of continued care.40 Arizona Medicaid, CRS, DD, LTC and EPD Provider Manual Confidential and Proprietary UHCCommunityPlan.com/UHCprovider .com Copyrighted by UnitedHealthcare 2018Chapter 5 Medical Management Specialty Referrals Primary Care Obstetrician PCOs must coordinate a member's care until the first day of the first month following the 60th day after delivery or termination of pregnancy (see Additional PCO Responsibilities, Chapter 2). The assigned PCO or perinatologist should perform EPSDT services for pregnant members younger than 21. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) PCPs may directly refer members with suspected diagnosis of autism to a specialized care provider who may diagnose and treat ASD. Both members and care providers can find the list of behavioral health network providers by using the Doctor Lookup searchable directory feature located on UHCCommunityPlan.com under the Member section. Perinatology Referrals When a PCO or PCP wants to refer a member for a consult to a participating perinatologist, prior authorization is necessary . If a PCO or PCP wants to transfer the entire care of the member while pregnant to a participating perinatologist, the transfer of care requires prior authorization. To arrange for this transfer of care, the PCO should call Healthy First Steps at 800-599-5985. Once the transfer is complete, the perinatologist becomes the member's PCO and is responsible for the member's care for the duration of the pregnancy and 60 days postpartum. The assigned PCO or perinatologist should perform EPSDT services for pregnant members younger than 21 years. Ancillary Referrals You may make referrals to ancillary service providers as follows: Dental All eligible members through the age of 20 may self-refer to a general dentist from the list of participating dentists in the member's provider directory or by calling Member Services. Children younger than 20 years are covered for preventive, therapeutic and emergency services. Adults 21 years and older are only covered for emergency palliative treatment. Dentists must help ensure members' waiting time at the dental office does not exceed 45 minutes for scheduled appointments, unless the dentist is unavailable due to an emergency. Dental providers should schedule time-specific appointments as stated in the Appointment Availability Standards section in Chapter 2. Durable Medical Equipment Send DME requests on a referral from or a prescription directly to the DME provider, Preferred HomeCare. The DME provider must obtain prior authorization if required. Claims and referrals sent to a non-participating DME provider will be denied. Infusion/Enteral Therapy Send medically necessary referrals directly to the participating care provider. That care provider obtains prior authorization before rendering service, if applicable. Laboratory Referrals Refer members to LabCorp unless a practitioner's contract allows onsite laboratory providers for medically necessity. Referrals to non-participating or hospital laboratories require prior authorization. See the Laboratory section in Chapter 4 for more details. Orthotics/Prosthetics (O/P) Send requests for orthotics/prosthetics on a referral form or a prescription directly to the O/P provider. A prescription must always be included with the request. The O/P provider should obtain prior authorization, if required. According to AHCCCS Medical Policy Manual, Chapter 300, Policy 310-P, orthotics are covered for members 21 years and older when all the following apply: -The use of the orthotic is medically necessary as the preferred treatment option consistent with Medicare Guidelines. -The orthotic costs less than all other treatment options or surgical procedures to treat the same condition. -The orthotic is ordered by a physician or PCP. Radiology Refer members to a participating radiology provider or to a hospital participating for outpatient radiology services unless the practitioner's contract allows radiology services to be performed onsite. Refer to UHCCommunityPlan.com under the Radiology section for a list of radiology CPTs that require prior authorization, a prior authorization crosswalk table as well as the link to the Online Notifications and Prior Authorizations portal. Transportation (Member) The use of transportation does not require authorization. Members must set up their own transportation but may be assisted by another person if necessary. If you need to help a member get a ride, call 888-700-6822 or 602- 889-1777. Members receiving behavioral health services through RBHA may receive transportation services only to their first RBHA appointment. RBHA-enrolled members may obtain transportation services through their RBHA provider. Members enrolled in CRS are eligible for transportation based on their CRS coverage type. Vision All eligible members younger than 21 years may self-refer to a participating vision care provider for routine vision services. Members may contact Nationwide Vision for vision care providers.

Additional exams require prior authorization and should be obtained by the PCP/PCO from Nationwide Vision. For members 21 years and older, diagnosis and/or treatment of refractive errors are not covered unless prescriptive lenses or contacts are the sole prosthetic device. Reimbursement UnitedHealthcare Community Plan authorization does not ensure reimbursement for all services provided. You should: Determine the member is eligible on the date of service by using Link, contacting Member Services, using the IVR system, checking their paper roster, verifying eligibility on AHCCCS Online, or using electronic verification. Submit appropriate and requested documentation to support the medical necessity of the requested procedure. Determine if the member has other insurance that should be billed first. Even with a valid prior authorization number, you will be reimbursed only for covered services as designated by your UnitedHealthcare Community Plan contract. If a conflict occurs between the manual and the agreement, the manual controls unless the agreement dictates otherwise. We will not reimburse: Services not determined by UnitedHealthcare Community Plan to be medically necessary. Non-covered services. Services provided to members who are not enrolled on the date(s) of service. Services provided outside the United States. Case Management We provide case management services to members who require service coordination due to complex medical conditions or serious psychosocial issues that affect their ability to obtain appropriate care.

UnitedHealthcare Community Plan pays its in-network PCPs and specialists on a fee-for-service basis. We also pay in-network hospitals and other types of care providers in the UnitedHealthcare Community Plan network on a fee-for-service basis. The plan's UM staff works with care providers to help ensure members receive the most appropriate care in the place best suited for the needed services. Our staff encourages appropriate use and discourages underuse. The UM staff does not receive incentives for UM decisions. Utilization Management (UM) Appeals These appeals contest UnitedHealthcare Community Plan's UM decisions. They are appeals of UnitedHealthcare Community Plan's admission, extension of stay, level of care, or other health care services determination. The appeal states it is not medically necessary or is considered experimental or investigational. It may also contest any admission, extension of stay, or other health care service due to late notification, or lack of complete or accurate information. Any member, their designee, or care provider who is dissatisfied with a UnitedHealthcare Community Plan UM decisions may file a UM appeal. See Appeals in Chapter 15 for more details.44 Arizona Medicaid, CRS, DD, LTC and EPD Provider Manual Confidential and Proprietary UHCCommunityPlan.com/UHCprovider.com Copyrighted by UnitedHealthcare 2018Chapter 6 Early, Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) EPSDT requirements are applicable to CRS Fully Integrated and CRS Partially Integrated Acute enrolled members. Check azahcccs.gov for any changes pertaining to updated benefits and EPSDT requirements. EPSDT Background Medicaid defines EPSDT services as screening services, vision services, dental services, hearing services and \"such other necessary health care, diagnostic services, treatment and other measures described in Federal Law Subsection 42 USC 1396d (a) to correct or improve defects and physical and mental illnesses and conditions discovered by the screening services, whether or not such services are covered under the (AHCCCS) State Plan.\" This means that EPSDT covered services include services that correct or improve physical and mental defects, conditions, and illnesses discovered by the screening process when those services fall within one of the optional and mandatory categories of \"Medical Assistance\", as defined in the Medicaid Act. Services covered under EPSDT include all 28 categories of services in the FederalLaw, even when they are not listed as covered services in the AHCCCS State Plan, AHCCCS statutes, rules or policies, as long as the services are medically necessary and cost effective. Clinicians must help ensure members receive required health screenings in compliance with the AHCCCS EPSDT periodicity schedule, which is available at UHCCommunityPlan.com under the Provider Forms section. It may also be found in Chapter AHCCS Medical Policy Manual, located at azahcccs.gov. The services determined by a PCP to be medically necessary should be provided, regardless of the interval. A well-child visit is synonymous with an EPSDT visit and includes all screening and services described in the EPSDT and dental periodicity schedules. The payment for the EPSDT covers all elements outlined in the AHCCCS EPSDT periodicity schedule. Refer to the AHCCCS Medical Policy Manual policy 430 for exception to the all-inclusive visit for global payment rate. Claims must be submitted on CMS 1500 claim form. You must bill for preventative EPSDT services using the preventative service, office or other outpatient services and preventative medicine CPT codes (99381-99385, 99391- 99395) with an EP modifier. EPSDT visits are paid at a global rate for the service specified in AMPM Policy 430. No additional reimbursement is allowed. AHCCCS EPSDT Tracking Forms, which you may use to document all age-specific required information related to EPSDT screenings and visits, are on UHCCommunityPlan.com in the Provider Forms section. They are also on azahcccs.gov in Appendix B of the AMPM. EPSDT Definitions Early means in the case of a child already enrolled with UnitedHealthcare Community Plan, as early as possible in the child's life, or in other cases, as soon after the member's eligibility for AHCCCS services has been established. Periodic means at intervals established by AHCCCS for screening to check that a condition, illness or injury is not present. Screening means regularly scheduled examinations and evaluations of the general physical and behavioral health, growth, development, and nutritional status of infants, children and youth. Screenings identify those in need of more definitive evaluation. Diagnosis means determining the cause of a condition, illness, or injury through health history, physical, developmental and psychological examination, laboratory tests, and X-rays, when appropriate. Treatment means any of the 28 mandatory or optional services described by federal law, even if the service is not covered under the AHCCCS plan, used to correct or improve physical and mental illnesses and conditions detected by screening or diagnostic procedures.

Billing for Additional Services Billing for a sick visit (CPT codes 99201-99215) at the same time as an EPSDT is acceptable if: An abnormality is encountered or a preexisting problem is addressed while performing an EPSDT service. The problem 50 Arizona Medicaid, CRS and DD Provider Manual Confidential and Proprietary UHCCommunityPlan.com / UnitedHealthcareOnline.com Copyrighted by UnitedHealthcare 2018Cochlear and Osseointegrated Implantation Cochlear Implantation: Cochlear implantation provides an awareness and identification of sounds and facilities communication for persons who have profound, sensorineural hearing loss (nerve deafness). Deafness may be prelingual/perilingual or postlingual. AHCCCS covers medically necessary services for cochlear implantation for EPSDT members. Candidates for cochlear implants must meet criteria for medical necessity, including but not limited to, the following indications: A diagnosis of bilateral profound sensorineural deafness (using age-appropriate standard testing), with littleor no benefi from a hearing (or vibrotactile) aid, as established by audiologic and medical evaluation. Presence of an accessible cochlear lumen structurally suited to implantation, with no lesionsin the auditory nerve and acoustic areas of thecentral nervous system, as demonstrated by CTscan or other appropriate radiologic evaluation. No known contraindications to surgery. Demonstrated age appropriate cognitive ability to use auditory clues, and The device must be used in accordance with the FDA-approved labeling. Cochlear implantation requires prior authorization for medical necessity through UnitedHealthcare. Osseointegrated Implants (Bone Anchored Hearing Aid [BAHA]): Coverage of medically necessary services for osseointegrated implantation is limited to EPSDT members. Osseointegrated implants are devices implanted in the skull that replace the function of the middle ear and provide mechanical energy to the cochlea via a mechanical transducer. These devices are indicated only when hearing aids are medically inappropriate or cannot be utilized due to congenital malformation, chronic disease, severe sensorineural hearing loss or surgery.Conscious Sedation AHCCCS covers conscious sedation for members receiving EPSDT services. Conscious sedation provides a state of consciousness that allows the member to tolerate an unpleasant procedure while continuously maintaining adequate cardiovascular and respiratory function, as well as the ability to respond purposely to verbal command and/or tactile stimulation. Coverage is provided for the following procedures except as specified below: Bone marrow biopsy with needle or trocar. Bone marrow aspiration. Intravenous chemotherapy administration, push technique. Chemotherapy administration into central nervous system by spinal puncture. Diagnostic lumbar spinal puncture, and Therapeutic spinal puncture for drainage of cerebrospinal fluidChapter 6 Early, Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) Additional applications of conscious sedation for members receiving EPSDT services will be considered on a case-by-case basis and require review for medical necessity and prior authorization by UnitedHealthcare for enrolled members. Arizona Medicaid, CRS and DD Provider Manual UHCCommunityPlan.com / UnitedHealthcareOnline.comConfidential and Proprietary Copyrighted by UnitedHealthcare 201642is significant enough to require additional work for a problem- oriented evaluation and management service (E/M). The sick visit is documented on a separate note. History, exam, and medical decision-making components of a separate sick visit already performed during the course of an EPSDT visit are not considered when determining the level of the additional service (CPT code 99201-99215). The current status (not history) of the abnormality or preexisting condition is the basis of determining medical necessity. Modifier 25 must be added to the Office/Outpatient code to indicate that a significant, separate identifiable E/M was provided by the same care provider on the same day as the preventive medicine service. Acute diagnosis codes not applicable to the current visit should not be billed. An insignificant problem encountered in the process of performing the preventive medicine evaluation and management service, and which does not require additional work, is included in the EPSDT visit and should not be reported. Arizona Early Intervention Program The Arizona Early Intervention Program (AzEIP) is a system of professionals working with parents and families of children, from birth to age 3, with developmental delays and/or disabilities. AzEIP provides assistance, encouragement and treatment. It allows early intervention and developmental services to occur in a family's natural environment. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan works with AzEIP and DD support coordinators, PCPs, servicing care providers (therapists/ facilities), CRS and member families. Together, they help ensure the child has medically eligible services, such as physical therapy , speech therapy and/or occupational therapy, in accordance with EPSDT guidelines. Care providers working with this population will receive an AzEIP Request for EPSDT Services and documentation completed by an AzEIP service coordinator. The AzEIP Request for EPSDT services and documentation is faxed to UnitedHealthcare Community Plan for review and then to the care provider. If the care provider feels the services are medically necessary, the care provider faxes back the request with signature, date and diagnosis codes related to the therapy request. The EPSDT coordinator at UnitedHealthcare Community Plan coordinates prior authorization and notifies the AzEIP service coordinator of approved services. AzEIP Evaluations for At-Risk Members (Younger than 3 Years) To help ensure our members younger than 3 years who are at risk of developmental delays and/or disabilities receive services appropriate for their specific condition/situation, we ask you to adhere to the following steps when requesting physical therapy, occupational therapy, or speech/feeding evaluation: After completing the evaluation, the servicing care provider who conducted the evaluation submits an Evaluation Report to the PCP. If the evaluation indicates that the member scored two standard deviations below the mean, which generally translates to Arizona Early Intervention Program (AzEIP) eligibility criteria of 50 percent developmental delay, the child continues receiving all medically necessary EPSDT services through UnitedHealthcare Community Plan. Be sure to: -Request ongoing therapies through our Prior Authorization department at 866-604-3267, and -If you have not already submitted an online referral, please complete one and submit it through AzEIP. If the member is in need of non-medically necessary services not covered by Medicaid but are covered under individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (IDEA) Part C, please notify our EPSDT coordinator at 602-255-8196 or 602-255-8108 if you have not previously submitted an AzEIP referral. Coordination of Therapy Services with CRS Members Enrolled in AzEIP To help ensure follow-up on EPSDT and Arizona Early Intervention Program (AzEIP) referrals for CRS-enrolled members, we coordinate receipt of care with the MSICs as the member's health home. EPSDT services for acute members include coverage for PT, OT, and Speech/Feeding Therapy between ages 0-21. The CRS coverage type determined the payer for these services: Category Criteria Fully Integrated UnitedHealthcare Community Plan Partially Integrated - AcuteUnitedHealthcare Community Plan Partially integrated - Behavioral HealthDD Plan of enrollment (which could be UnitedHealthcare Community Plan DD, or other DD Plan) or member's Comprehensive Medical and Dental Program (CMDP) CRS Only Primary program of enrollment We must review and respond to AzEIP referrals within 10 business days. The following process has been developed to meet the AHCCCS requirement: An AzEIP service coordinator submits a therapy (OT/PT/ST) request to our coordinator for EPSDT and AzEIP services. The coordinator forwards the referral to the appropriate CRS liaison to determine if the MSIC can provide therapy services.51 Arizona Medicaid, CRS and DD Provider Manual Confidential and Proprietary UHCCommunityPlan.com / UnitedHealthcareOnline.com Copyrighted by UnitedHealthcare 2018 The member is over three (3) years and under twenty-one (21) years old.

Therapies are covered under both an inpatient and outpatient basis when medically necessary. Sick Visit Performed in Addition to AN EPSDT Visit Billing of a 'sick visit' (CPT codes 99201-99215) at the same time as an EPSDT is a separately billable service if: An abnormality is encountered or a preexisting problem is addressed in the process of performing an EPSDTservice and the problem or abnormality is significan enough to require additional work to perform the key components of a problem-oriented E/M service. The 'sick visit' is documented on a separate note. History, Exam, and Medical Decision Making components of a separate 'sick visit' already performed during the course of an EPSDT visit arenot to be considered when determining the level ofthe additional service (CPT code 99201-99215).Chapter 6 Early, Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) Behavioral Health Services AHCCCS covers behavioral health services for members eligible for EPSDT services. EPSDT behavioral health services include the services listed in Federal Law 42 USC 1396d(a) necessary to correct or ameliorate mental illnesses and conditions discovered by the screening services whether or not the services are covered under the AHCCCS State Plan.

Enrollment Choice in a County with Choice and Change of Contractor: Arizona Long-Term Care System Contractors The information provided is from the AHCCCS Policy 403, which establishes guidelines, criteria and timeframes for how, when and by whom enrollment choice in a county and contractor change requests will be processed for ALTCS EPD enrollees. This section applies to ALTCS EPD Contractors only (hereafter referred to as contractors). This policy delineates the rights, obligations and responsibilities of: The member, The member's current contractor, The receiving contractor, and The AHCCCS administration. In facilitating continuity of care, quality of care and efficient and effective program operations and in responding to administrative issues regarding enrollee notification and errors in assignment. Enrollment Choice in a Choice County Enrollment choice is available when: An applicant lives in a county with choice, and that county has fiscal responsibility. A member moves from another county to their own home in a county with choice, unless the member's current contractor is available in that county. A member moves from another county to a nursing facility or alternative residential setting in a county with choice, and the current contractor has chosen to negotiate an enrollment change. A member is currently enrolled with a contractor serving a county with choice, but a valid condition exists (see Section B) for requesting an enrollment change to another contractor serving in that county. A former member resides in a county with choice and reestablishes eligibility that results in reenrollment more than 90 days after disenrollment. A member reaches the annual anniversary date. Enrollment choice is not available for: An American Indian member with on-reservation status. A member whose county of fiscal responsibility is not a county with choice (unless the current contractor chooses to negotiate a change). A member who was disenrolled from a contractor in a county with choice but then reestablishes ALTCS EPD eligibility that results in reenrollment within 90 days from disenrollment. A member who moves to a county with choice, and their current contractor is available in that county. Requests for Contractor Changes within a County of Choice An enrollment change from one contractor to another, in a county with choice, can be made outside of a member's annual enrollment choice for the following reasons: Medical Continuity of Care Requests Contractor changes may be approved on a case-by-case basis to help ensure the member's access to care. To provide continuity of care on a temporary basis for the member's period of illness, the current contractor may agree to a reimbursement schedule with the member's care provider rather than approve a contractor change. If both contractors' medical directors approve the change request: The current contractor sends the completed Contractor Change Request (CCR) Form to the requested contractor and the AHCCCS Central Office. Refer to AMPM Exhibit 1620-8. The current contractor tells the member the change is approved and when it takes effect. If the requested contractors deny the request: The CCR Form is returned to the current contractor. The current contractor must notify the member in writing when the change request is denied. The denial notice must include the contractor's grievance, appeal system policy and timeframes for filing a grievance. The current contractor may forward the CCR Form to the AHCCCS chief medical officer (CMO) or designee for a final decision. If the AHCCCS CMO or designee approves the change, 66 Arizona Medicaid, CRS, DD, LTC and EPD Provider Manual Confidential and Proprietary UHCCommunityPlan.com/UHCprovider .com Copyrighted by UnitedHealthcare 2018the CCR Form is returned to the current contractor for submission to the AHCCCS Central Office. If the AHCCCS chief medical officer or designee denies the change request, AHCCCS will provide written notice of the denial. It will include notice of appeal rights to the member and to both the current and requested contractors. Incorrect Network Information or Agency Error The applicant or representative made an enrollment choice based on incorrect information about the facility, residential setting, PCP or other care provider contracting with the chosen contractor. This decision might have been based on information supplied by the network database, marketing materials, or agency error. Such information includes omissions or failure to share network limitations in the contractor's marketing material or database submissions. The current contractor submits a Member Change Report for these requests. Lack of Initial Enrollment Choice In this case, an ALTCS EPD applicant residing in a county with choice was not offered a choice of contractors during the application process. The current contractor submits a Member Change Report for these requests. Lack of Annual Enrollment Choice The member was entitled to participate in an annual enrollment choice but was not sent notice. Or the notice was not received. Alternatively, the member was sent an Annual Enrollment Choice notice but could not participate due to circumstances beyond the member's control (e.g., member or representative was hospitalized, anniversary date fell within a 90-day disenroll/ reenroll period). The current contractor submits a Member Change Report for these requests. Family Continuity of Care The member, either through auto-assignment or the choice process, was not enrolled with the same contractor as their family members. The current contractor submits a Member Change Report for these requests. Continuity of Care Providers The contractor's agreement with the institutional, residential or employment supports care providers from whom the member receives services is terminated. The member or their representative requests to change to a contractor who works with their care provider. The member must be receiving services from the care provider at the time of the contract termination. The current contractor submits a Member Change Report for these requests.Failure to Correctly Apply the 90-Day Reenrollment Policy A member who lost ALTCS EPD eligibility and was disenrolled, yet was reapproved for ALTCS EPD eligibility within 90 days of the disenrollment date but enrolled with a different contractor.

Enrollment is with a contractor serving the geographic service area (or fiscal county) where the home is located. When the member moves to their own home in a county with choice and is not already enrolled with a contractor serving that county, the member must be given an opportunity to choose a contractor. The member will be enrolled with the contractor through the enrollment choice process. Member Responsibilities The member must report a move or anticipated move to the current contractor and AHCCCS. Contractor Responsibilities The current contractor must: Notify AHCCCS that the member moved by sending a Member Change Report. Explain service limitations to a member who moves out of the contractor's service area.

Long-Term Care Services Case Management The UnitedHealthcare Community Plan case manager evaluates the member's health care needs to determine the appropriate residential setting, Level of Care (LOC) and necessary services to safely maintain them in the least restrictive environment. All LTC services require prior notification by the case manager. All facility settings require the appropriate registration, licensure and insurance liability coverage. You must send copies of updated licenses and certificates upon renewal. Not providing this information may result in non-payment of rendered services and termination of your UnitedHealthcare Community Plan agreement. Case managers conduct onsite assessments of members to help ensure the appropriateness of the caregiver. They also assess the type and amount of services being rendered to the member. If we find out a care provider's performance is unsatisfactory, we will contact the care provider with the findings and care issues. The care provider must address the issues and follow up with UnitedHealthcare Community Plan promptly. If a quality management issue emerges, we follow appropriate procedures to help ensure the member receives the highest quality of care. Members residing in nursing facilities or assisted living facility settings are responsible for the Member Share of Cost (MSOC) or Room and Board (R&B) payment as applicable.

This practice results in: A consistent practice that provides voice and empowerment to staff members within your office A qualified, knowledgeable and culturally competent workforce Timely information about initiatives and best practices Services are delivered in a manner that results in achievement of the Arizona System Principles as AMPM Policy 430. Behavioral Health Provider Responsibilities Clarify payment responsibility between behavioral health and physical health services. Payment for AHCCCS-covered behavioral health and physical health services is determined by the principal diagnosis on the claim, except in limited circumstances as described in attachment A of the AHCCCS Contractor Operations Manual (ACOM), Chapter 400. If physical health services are listed on a claim with a principal diagnosis of behavioral health, the member's behavioral health program pays for covered physical health services as well as behavioral health services. If behavioral health services are listed on a claim with a principal diagnosis of physical health, the member's medical/ physical health program is pays for covered behavioral health services as well as physical health services. Payment responsibility for professional services associated with an inpatient stay is determined by the principal diagnosis on the claim. Payment responsibility for the inpatient facility claim and the associated services is not necessarily the same program. Payment for an emergency department facility claim of an acute care facility is the responsibility of the member's insurance carrier, regardless of the principal 73 Arizona Medicaid, CRS, DD, LTC and EPD Provider Manual Confidential and Proprietary UHCCommunityPlan.com/UHCprovider .com Copyrighted by UnitedHealthcare 2018Chapter 9 Behavioral Health diagnosis. Payment responsibility for professional services associated with the emergency department visit is determined by the principal diagnosis on the professional claim. Payment responsibility of the emergency department visit and the associated services is not necessarily the same program. Services associated with a PCP visit for diagnosis and treatment of depression, anxiety and/or attention deficit hyperactive disorder is covered under physical health. PCPs who treat members with these behavioral health conditions may provide medication services including prescriptions and other tests necessary for diagnosis and treatment in accordance with UnitedHealthcare Community Plan guidelines. Use seclusion and restraint only as permitted by A.A.C. R9-21-204. If you use restraint or seclusion, report it on the Seclusion and Restraint Individual Reporting Form (AHCCCS Policy 962 Attachment A). Completely fill out the form and fax to 888-821-5101 or email to specialcare_UB2@optum.com . Direct questions to this email address as well. AHCCCS FFS pays for physical and behavioral health services claims provided by an IHS or a tribally owned and/or operated facility to Title XIX members whether enrolled in managed care or FFS. Principal Diagnosis: The condition established after study to be chiefly responsible for occasioning the admission or care for the member (as indicated by the Principal Diagnosis on a UB-04 claim form from a facility or the first listed diagnosis on a CMS 1500 claim line). The principal diagnosis should not be confused with the admitting diagnosis or any other diagnoses on the claim. Neither the admitting diagnosis nor other diagnoses should be used to assign payment responsibility.

Persistently or acutely disabled (PAD). Gravely disabled (GD). Information about these screenings and court-ordered treatments can be found on the AHCCCS website at azAHCCCS.gov , Behavioral Health Policy & Procedures Manual, Policy 109. If the person appears to meet clinical standards as a danger to self or others; or they are persistently, acutely or gravely disabled; you must determine whether to engage the person to seek inpatient care voluntarily. If this is not a viable option, and the clinical standard is met, the care provider may initiate the pre-petition screening or petition for treatment process for court- ordered evaluation and treatment. Outreach, Engagement, Re-Engagement and Closure Outreach UnitedHealthcare Community Plan provides outreach activities to inform the public of the benefits and availability of behavioral health services and how to access them. We disseminate this information to the general public and through our community partners, to care providers, and other interested parties. Outreach activities may include but are not limited to: Participation in local health fairs or health promotion activities. Involvement with local schools. Routine contact with AHCCCS health plan behavioral health coordinators and/or PCPs. Development of homeless outreach programs. Development of outreach programs to persons who are at risk, are identified as a group with high incidence or prevalence of behavioral health issues or are underserved. Publication and distribution of informational materials. Liaison activities with local and county jails, county detention facilities, and local and county DCS offices and programs. Contact with substance abusing pregnant women/teenagers, when identified through our maternity program, Healthy First Steps. Development and implementation of outreach programs that identify persons with co-morbid medical and behavioral health disorders and those who have been determined to have a SMI. Provision of information to mental health advocacy organizations. Development and coordination of outreach programs to Native American tribes in Arizona to provide services for tribal members.Engagement UnitedHealthcare Community Plan and our subcontracted behavioral health care providers actively engage the following in the treatment planning process: The person and/or person's legal guardian/designated representative per AHCCCS. The person's family/significant others, if applicable and amenable to the person. Other agencies/providers as applicable. For persons with a SMI who are receiving special assistance, the person (guardian, family member, advocate or other) designated to provide it. Behavioral health care providers must provide services in a culturally competent manner in accordance with our Cultural Competency Plan. See Chapter 1 for more information and resources. Re-Engagement Participating behavioral health care providers attempt to re- engage persons who have withdrawn from treatment, refused services or failed to appear for a scheduled service. These attempts are documented in the comprehensive clinical record. Further attempts may include contacting the person, their legal guardian or natural supports who the member has given permission to contact. Closure A CRS member may need to be closed to behavioral health services after re-engagement efforts have been expended. Ending the episode of care can occur due to clinical or administrative factors involving the CRS member in a treatment plan. No-Show Policy For all members receiving SMI services, the participating behavioral health care provider/clinical team must attempt a telephonic contact with member within 24 hours following any missed appointment. If the clinical team cannot reach the member by phone, it completes a face-to-face/home visit within 72 hours following a missed appointment. For all members receiving General Mental Health/Substance Abuse (GMH/SA) services, the clinical team must try to call the member within 24 hours after any missed appointment. If the clinical team does not reach the member on the first attempt, it tries again within 72 hours.75 Arizona Medicaid, CRS, DD, LTC and EPD Provider Manual Confidential and Proprietary UHCCommunityPlan.com/UHCprovider .com Copyrighted by UnitedHealthcare 2018Chapter 9 Behavioral Health Medication Management PCPs may continue with medication management of members who have been treated and stabilized by the RBHA for behavioral health disorders of uncomplicated ADHD, anxiety or depression for no less than six months. However the following conditions must be met: PCP feels comfortable in managing members' psychotropic medications. Treatment is within the care provider's scope of practice and expertise. PCP may request these medications for continuity of care by submitting a completed UnitedHealthcare Pharmacy Prior Authorization Form indicating step therapy has been completed, and the member needs to continue on current medication and dosage for stabilization, unless the medical condition changes. PDL medications requiring drugs requiring step therapy are routinely covered only after a sufficient trial of an indicated first-line agent has failed. Before faxing the completed Pharmacy Prior Authorization Form with documentation, please indicate on the Pharmacy Prior Authorization Form: \"Request for Step Therapy Medication.\" -State if the request is expedited or routine. -To prevent any lapse in medication coverage, or for assistance with this process, contact UnitedHealthcare Pharmacy at 800-310-6826 or fax to 800-853-3844. UnitedHealthcare Pharmacy Prior Authorization Form can be obtained at UHCCommunityPlan.com. Step Therapy Step therapy drugs appearing on the PDL require a trial and failure of a specific covered drug(s) before a member can receive the step therapy drug. These drugs are covered automatically if the members' pharmacy history shows that the required drug(s) have been tried first. If the pharmacy history shows that the required drug had not been tried, the prescriber needs to submit a prior authorization request. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan asks the prescriber to submit information explaining why the member cannot use the required drug(s) first. However, members who have been stabilized on a medication while in service through the RBHA for the treatment of ADHD, anxiety and/or depression will be maintained on that medication when discharged and seeing PCP for medication management. If the PCP identifies a change in the member's condition, the PCP may use step therapy until the member is stabilized again.UnitedHealthcare Community Plan covers the cost of the medication and dose that the member had been stabilized on. Behavioral Health Screenings The PCP should screen members for behavioral health needs during routine or preventative visits. EPSDT and behavioral health screenings for members younger than 21 years need to be completed in accordance to the AHCCCS periodicity schedule. Based on the behavioral health screening and assessment, Best Practice Guidelines, and EBM, PCPs must launch a behavioral health referral to the member's assigned RBHA. For more information go to: UHCCommunityPlan.com. Serious Mental Illness Determination Behavioral health providers must use the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) Scale as a screening mechanism for identifying persons (including enrolled children upon reaching 17.5 years old) who may have functional impairments because of a SMI-qualifying diagnosis. A qualified assessor must complete all SMI evaluations. If the qualified assessor is a behavioral health technician, the evaluation must be reviewed, approved and signed by a behavioral health professional. All persons must be evaluated for SMI eligibility by a qualified assessor, and have an SMI eligibility determination made by the Crisis Response Network, if the person: Requests an SMI determination or Has a score of 50 or lower on the GAF and has a qualifying SMI diagnosis. Instruct any members questioning whether they can be determined SMI to call their LTC case manager. The LTC plan has an SMI coordinator who will assist the case manager and the member with the process. This helps ensure SMI determinations and services are provided as specified in Title 9, Health Services, Chapter 21 AHCCCS Behavioral Health Services for Persons with a Serious Mental Illness (R9-21). For members who are already determined to be SMI, the case manager informs them of their grievance and appeal rights about their services as specified in R9-21. An appeal of a denial of SMI determination goes through the AHCCCS-selected SMI Determination Agency and the case manager. The SMI coordinator assists the member with this process if needed (R9-21). The case manager informs the member of their rights to obtain special assistance from the Office of Human Rights as specified in R9-21.76 Arizona Medicaid, CRS, DD, LTC and EPD Provider Manual Confidential and Proprietary UHCCommunityPlan.com/UHCprovider .com Copyrighted by UnitedHealthcare 2018During the initial LTC assessment of the member and all subsequent reassessments, the case manager completes a screening to see if the member has any of the qualifying diagnosis to be determined as SMI. If they do, the case manager discusses with the member or their legal guardian the SMI determination process to see if this is something they want to pursue. PCP Coordination of Care Responsibilities The PCP helps ensure a member-specific medical record is established when behavioral health documentation is received from the RBHA or behavioral health provider on an assigned member. Even if you have not seen the member, a record must be created. In lieu of establishing a medical record, such information may be kept in an appropriately labeled file. However, it must be associated with the member's medical record as soon as one is established. The PCP will respond to behavioral health provider or T/RBHA information requests pertaining to the behavioral health recipient within 10 business days of receiving the request. The response should include all pertinent information including, but not limited to, current diagnoses, medications, laboratory results, last PCP visit and recent hospitalizations. PCPs may contact the behavioral health provider or RBHAs and request a phone consultation with a psychiatrist regarding the medication management, transition of care and treatment options for a member with a behavioral health diagnosis with co-morbidities. They should call RBHA Member Services, following the prompts for 'Consultations', or fax Policy Form 103.1 Referral for Behavioral Health Services , particularly if they opt to transfer the member's care. For \"type of service requested,\" indicate \"one-time consultation.\" Under \"reason for referral\" section, they should indicate if they are requesting telephonic consultation for medication management, phone number and best time to be contacted. Member does not have to be RBHA-enrolled for PCP to obtain a consultation. If a transfer is recommended, the transition period to the RBHA should take place within 30 days and no later than 90 days. PCPs receive a \"disposition fax\" from the T/RBHA informing them of the member's enrollment status. If you do not receive a disposition fax, contact the T/RBHA and ask to speak to a liaison or behavioral health coordinator. The PCP documents and initials the behavioral health documentation received on one of their assigned health plan members. The signature indicates their knowledge that the member is receiving behavioral health service.Non-Behavioral Health Care Provider Responsibilities PCPs and other care providers should play an active role in the member's behavioral health treatment. No matter the circumstances, the member and their family must be a part of the treatment planning process. Discussing with the member and their family how they are doing in treatment can reinforce the importance of continuing treatment. Doing so also provides them the opportunity to discuss issues. Another key to success is to be aware of what types of treatment (both in terms of services and medications) the member is receiving. This will help support the behavioral health treatment plan. Non-behavioral health care providers receive regular correspondence from the case manager concerning psychotropic medications the member is prescribed. This information should be filed in the member's medical record for easy reference. The PCP should establish a separate record for behavioral health information. Our Quality Management program incorporates monitoring of the PCP's referral to, coordination of care with, and transfer of care to behavioral health providers. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan performs random Behavioral Health Record Reviews (BHRR) yearly on providers that have 10 or more members actively receiving behavioral health services, or in which the PCP is prescribing and/or managing member's medications for the treatment of ADHD, anxiety or depression. Psychotropic Medication Management Members who require psychotropic medications that cannot be managed by a PCP are provided services from either a psychiatrist or a nurse practitioner within psychiatric care experience. Behavioral Health Best Practices and Guidelines PCPs may treat UnitedHealthcare Community Plan members with behavioral health disorders of ADHD, anxiety and depression that are considered \"uncomplicated.\" We define uncomplicated as an individual who does not have multiple behavioral health diagnoses in which treatment/medication is required simultaneously, receiving services for substance abuse, prior inpatient psychiatric treatment within the last year, history of dangerous or harmful behavior toward self or others (includes overdoses and suicide attempts). You can obtain these guidelines on our website at UHCCommunityPlan.com under the Clinical Practice Guidelines Section Chapter 9 Behavioral Health77 Arizona Medicaid, CRS, DD, LTC and EPD Provider Manual Confidential and Proprietary UHCCommunityPlan.com/UHCprovider .com Copyrighted by UnitedHealthcare 2018Chapter 9 Behavioral Health Diabetic Members Admitted to Arizona State Hospital Diabetic members who are admitted to the Arizona State Hospital (AzSH) for behavioral health services will receive training to use a glucometer and testing supplied during their stay at AzSH. Upon discharge, the PCP will be provided with the diabetic information to include the brand and model of equipment the member has been trained on. The PCP must help ensure that members are issued the same brand and model of both glucometer and supplies they were trained on during their admission. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan will coordinate with AzSH to help ensure that the member has sufficient testing supplies to last until the member is scheduled an office visit with the PCP. If the member's mental status renders them incapable or unwilling to manage their medical condition, and that condition requires medically necessary ongoing medical care, UnitedHealthcare Community Plan will coordinate with the RBHA, member guardian, and AzSH to obtain the appropriate discharge placement and follow-up care. AHCCCS Behavioral Health Toolkits AHCCCS has developed a set of clinical toolkits that include assessments and algorithms to assist PCPs in assessing the needs of the children/adolescents (8-17 years old), and adults (18 years and older), the need and type of medication, and if a RBHA referral is indicated. A Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) Toolkit for PCPs who, within their scope of practice, treat members with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) is also available. The toolkits can be accessed online at UHCCommunityPlan.com under the Clinical Practice Guidelines section.

Otherwise, clinicians and group practices should submit changes in writing, using fax or mail, to your state- specific Network Management Team. Facilities or agencies should submit their changes, in writing, using fax or email, to the network manager or facility contract manager. Termination or Restriction of Behavioral Health Network Your participation with Optum can end for a variety of reasons. Both parties may terminate the agreement upon written notice, pursuant to the terms of your agreement. If you need clarification on how to terminate your agreement, you may contact Network Management or your facility contract manager. Network clinicians, group practices and agencies who withdraw from our network are required to notify us, in writing in accordance with your agreement, 90 calendar days prior to the effective date of termination, unless otherwise stated in your agreement or required by state law. With the exception of terminations due to quality-related issues; suspected fraud, waste or abuse; change in license status; or change in ability to participate in federal programs, you are obligated to provide treatment for all members under your care. The timeline for continued treatment is up to 90 calendar days from the effective date of the contract termination, or as outlined in your agreement or until one of the following conditions is met, whichever is shortest: The member is transitioned to another participating clinician. The current episode of care has been completed. The member's benefit is no longer active. Please note that AHCCCS regulations will be followed for member transition. To help ensure continuity of care, we notify members affected by the termination of a clinician, group practice or agency at least 30 calendar days prior to the effective date of the termination whenever feasible. We assist these members in selecting a new clinician, group or agency. You are also expected to clearly inform members of your impending non-participation status upon the earlier of the member's next appointment or prior to the effective termination date, in compliance with your agreement. Network Facilities That withdraw from the network are required to notify us, in writing in accordance with your agreement, 120 calendar days before the date of termination unless otherwise stated in your agreement or required by Arizona state law. To prevent disruption in a member's care, Optum has established a 120 calendar-day transition period for voluntary terminations. If a facility's participation is terminated due to quality, fraud or change in license status requiring immediate 79 Arizona Medicaid, CRS, DD, LTC and EPD Provider Manual Confidential and Proprietary UHCCommunityPlan.com/UHCprovider .com Copyrighted by UnitedHealthcare 2018Chapter 9 Behavioral Health transfer of a member to another facility, UnitedHealthcare Community Plan and the facility coordinate a safe and effective transition of care. Members may not be balance billed. Communication with PCPs and Other Health Care Professionals We expect you to coordinate and manage care between behavioral health and medical professionals and/or other behavioral health clinicians (e.g., psychiatrists, therapists). Coordination and communication should take place at the time of intake, during treatment, the time of discharge or termination of care, between levels of care and at any other point in treatment that may be appropriate. Please help ensure coordination with CRS clinical liaisons for the member's assigned MSIC. Coordination of services improves the quality of care to members in several ways: Behavioral health and medical care providers can create a comprehensive care plan. PCPs know their patient followed through on a behavioral health referral. Potential adverse medication interactions for members who are being treated with psychotropic and on psychotropic medication are minimized. Management of treatment and follow-up for members with coexisting behavioral and medical disorders is improved. Members can transition from one level of care to another safely and effectively. Relapses are reduced. The following guidelines help facilitate effective communication among all treatment professionals involved in a member's care: During the diagnostic assessment session, request the member's written consent to exchange information with all appropriate treatment professionals. After the initial assessment, provide other treating professionals with the following information within two weeks: -Summary of member's evaluation. -Diagnosis. -Treatment plan summary (including any medications prescribed). -Primary clinician treating the member. -Update other behavioral health and/or medical clinicians when there is a change in the member's condition or medication(s). -Update other health care professionals when serious medical conditions warrant closer coordination. -At the completion of treatment, send a copy of the discharge summary to the other treating professionals. -Attempt to obtain all relevant clinical information that other treating professionals may have pertaining to the member's mental health or substance use problems. Some members may refuse to allow for release of this information. This decision must be noted in the clinical record after reviewing the potential risks and benefits of this decision. We, as well as accrediting organizations, expect you to make a \"good faith\" effort at communicating with other behavioral health clinicians or facilities and any medical care professionals who are treating the member as part of an overall approach to coordinating care. Treatment Record Documentation Requirements In accordance with your agreement, you must maintain high-quality medical, financial and administrative records. This includes appointment or scheduling books related to the behavioral health services you provide. These records must be maintained in a manner consistent with the standards of the community, and conform to all applicable laws and regulations including, but not limited to, state licensing, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and/or national certification board standards. To perform required utilization management, practice management and quality improvement activities, we may request access to such records, including but not limited to, claims records and treatment record documentation. You are permitted under HIPAA Treatment, Payment or Healthcare Operations to provide requested records as contractually required. In accordance with HIPAA and the definition of Treatment, Payment or Healthcare Operations, you must provide such records upon request. Federal, state and local government or accrediting agencies may also request such information as necessary to comply with accreditation standards, laws or regulations applicable to Optum and its payers, customers, clinicians, and facilities. We may review your records during a scheduled onsite audit. We may also ask you to submit copies of the records to use for review. An onsite audit and/or treatment record review may occur for a number of reasons, including but not limited to: Reviews of facilities without national accreditation such as The Joint Commission, Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF) or other agencies approved by us. Audits of high-volume clinicians. Routine random audits. Audits related to claims, coding or billing issues. Audits concerning quality of care issues. Audits related to a member complaint regarding the physical environment of an office or facility.80 Arizona Medicaid, CRS, DD, LTC and EPD Provider Manual Confidential and Proprietary UHCCommunityPlan.com/UHCprovider .com Copyrighted by UnitedHealthcare 2018Chapter 9 Behavioral Health The audits may focus on the physical environment (including safety issues), policies and procedures, and/or thoroughness and quality of documentation within treatments records and/ or accuracy of billing and coding. We have established a passing performance goal of 85% for both the Treatment Record Review and Onsite Audit. Onsite Audit or Treatment Record Review scores under 85% will require a written Corrective Action Plan (CAP). Scores under 80% require submission of a written CAP and a re-audit within six months of the implementation of the CAP. However, in some cases, a requesting committee may require a CAP and/or re-audit regardless of the scores on the audit tools. Billing records should reflect the member who was treated, the rendering clinician and the modality of care. Audits related to claims, coding or billing issues may require corrective action. Treatment Record - Content Standards When billing services for more than one family member, separate treatment records must be maintained. We require that all non- electronic treatment records are written legibly in blue or black ink. All treatment records must include the following: The member's name or identification number on each page of the record. The member's address; employer or school; home and work telephone numbers, including emergency contacts; marital or legal status; appropriate consent forms; and guardianship information.

Member Records Storage Guidelines Following are additional guidelines for completing and maintaining treatment records for members. Practice sites and facilities must have an organized system of filing information in treatment records Treatment records must be stored in a secure area and the site must have an established procedure to maintain the confidentiality of treatment records in accordance with an applicable laws and regulations, including HIPAA. The site must have a process in place to ensure that records are available to qualified professionals if the treating clinician is absent. Treatment records are required to be maintained for a minimum period of seven years from the date of service, or in accordance with applicable state or federal laws or regulations, whichever is longer. Termination of the Agreement has no bearing on this requirement. Financial records concerning covered services rendered are required to be maintained from the date of service for 10 years, or the period required by applicable state or federal law, whichever is longer. Termination of the Agreement has no bearing on this requirement. Audits of Sites and Records Onsite and record-only audits may occur with any participating care provider. Both types of audits involve reviewing a sampling of treatment records. The onsite audit also involves a review of policies and procedures, including policies related to hiring and supervision of staff, discussion of services that are offered and a 82 Arizona Medicaid, CRS, DD, LTC and EPD Provider Manual Confidential and Proprietary UHCCommunityPlan.com/UHCprovider .com Copyrighted by UnitedHealthcare 2018Chapter 9 Behavioral Health tour of the facility or office site. Our representatives conduct site visits at clinician offices, agencies such as community mental health centers (CMHCs), facilities, and group care provider locations. On-site audits are routinely completed with CMHCs and facilities without national accreditation. In addition, audits are completed to address specific quality of care issues or in response to member complaints about the quality of the office or facility environment. Facilities and CMHCs that hold national accreditation through organizations such as the Joint Commission, CARF, Council on Accreditation (COA), Healthcare Facilities Accreditation Program (HFAP), National Integrated Accreditation for Healthcare Organizations (NIAHO), Community Health Accreditation Program (CHAP), and/or Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC) receive credit for meeting those standards of care for the identified accredited services or programs without additional review prior to the initial credentialing process. Facilities and CMHCs that are not accredited will be required to participate in an on-site audit prior to credentialing and a re-credentialing audit prior to their specified Re-credentialing timeframe. Any facility or CMHC, regardless of their accreditation status, may be subject to an on-site audit for any member complaints or suspected quality of care concerns brought to our attention. During onsite and record-only audits for all types of care providers, chart documentation is reviewed, including (but not limited to) the assessment, diagnosis, treatment plan, progress notes, monitoring risk issues, coordination of care activities, and discharge planning. This process also verifies that services were provided to members. You are expected to maintain adequate medical records on all members and document in the record all services that are provided. Prior to the audit, you will be notified of the specific types of charts that will be reviewed. Failure to adequately document services that are rendered and/or dates of services may lead to a request for a CAP. Please see the \"Treatment Record Documentation Requirements\" section of this manual for more information. The audit tools are based on NCQA, the Joint Commission and Optum standards. These forms are used during audits and are available at Provider Express for reference: Home page > Clinical Resources > Forms > Optum Forms > Site Audit Tools Compensation and Claims Processing The network rate for eligible outpatient visits is reimbursed to you at the lesser of (1) your customary charge, less any applicable copayments, coinsurance and deductibles due from the member, or (2) the contracted fee maximum, less any applicable copayments, coinsurance and deductibles due from the member. Fee maximums can vary based on different insurance plans and are available upon request.The contracted rate for facilities is referenced in the Payment Appendix of the facility agreement and defines rates applicable to inpatient and/or outpatient care through that facility. When the contracted rates include physician fees, the facility is responsible for payment of all treating care providers and for notifying the care providers that payment will be made by the facility and not us. Financial records concerning covered services rendered are required to be maintained from the date of service for the greater of 10 years, or the period required by applicable state or federal law, whichever is longer. Any termination of the agreement has no bearing on this legal obligation. Crisis Line Cochise, Gila, Graham, Greenlee, La Paz, Santa Cruz, Crisis Line: 877-765-4090 As in any emergency situation, any member, regardless of eligibility, can be referred to an emergency room for an evaluation and possible admission or calling the Crisis Lines listed above.

Members can call Member Services at 800-348-4058 and ask for the contact information for a behavioral health care provider. Referrals to behavioral health care providers are based on where member resides, member request, provider specialty and expertise.

This helps ensure appropriate training, education, and development opportunities are completed. Following the requirements helps provide: A consistent practice of philosophy and provide voice and empowerment to staff members within your practice. A qualified, knowledgeable and culturally competent workforce. Timely information regarding initiatives and best practices. Services that are delivered in a manner that results in achievement of the Arizona System Principles as outlines in the AHCCCS Medical Policy Manual (AMPM) Policy 430. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan may provide specific technical assistance as requested. For required training topics, please refer to AHCCCS Medical Policy Manual 1060. We require attestation from participating care providers that their employees are completing the 90-day new employee trainings as well as the annual employee trainings. Long-Term Care Supported Housing The Arizona Department of Health Services, Division of Behavioral Health Services (ADHS/DBHS) and T/RBHAs have helped ensure a variety of housing options and support services are available to assist members with a SMI live as independently as possible. Recovery often starts with safe, decent and affordable housing so that individuals can live, work, learn and participate in their communities. Safe, stable, and familiar living arrangements are critical to a person's ability to benefit from treatment and support services. For those who can live independently, T/RBHAs have a number of programs to support independent living, such as rent subsidy programs, supported housing programs, bridge subsidy housing assistance while obtaining federal funding, and provider-owned or leased homes and apartment complexes that combine housing services with other covered behavioral health services. Similarly , TRBHA housing programs include rent subsidy programs, owner occupied home repairs, move-in assistance and eviction prevention programs coupled with needed supported housing services to maintain independent living. AHCCCS has adopted the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) model for permanent supported housing programs. The 12 key elements of the SAMHSA Permanent Supportive Housing Program are: a. Tenants have a lease in their name, and, therefore, they have full rights of tenancy under landlord-tenant law, including control over living space and protection against eviction, b. Leases do not have any provisions that would not be found in leases held by someone who does not have a psychiatric disability, c. Participation in services is voluntary and tenants cannot be evicted for rejecting services, d. House rules, if any, are similar to those found in housing for people who do not have psychiatric disabilities and do not restrict visitors or otherwise interfere with a life in the community, e. Housing is not time-limited, and the lease is renewable at tenants' and owners' option, f. Before moving into Permanent Supportive Housing, tenants are asked about their housing preferences and are offered the same range of choices as are available to others at their income level in the same housing market, g. Housing is affordable, with tenants paying no more than 30 percent of their income toward rent and utilities, with the balance available for discretionary spending, Housing is integrated. Tenants have the opportunity to interact with neighbors who do not have psychiatric disabilities, i. Tenants have choices in the support services that they receive. Tenants are asked about their choices and can choose from a range of services, and different tenants receive different types of services based on their needs and preferences, j. As needs change over time, tenants can receive more intensive or less intensive support services without losing their homes, k. Support services promote recovery and are designed to help tenants choose, get, and keep housing, and l. The provision of housing and the provision of support services are distinct. Section 4: Dual Non-SMI Behavioral Health Benefits for Medicaid Members with Medicare Coverage UnitedHealthcare Community Plan provides the behavioral health services for members 18 years and older who are enrolled in AHCCCS for both their Medicaid and Medicare A/B benefit coverage and do not have a SMI.

Change of Contractor / Acute Care Contractors For Acute Care contractors, the AHCCCS policy 401 establishes guidelines, criteria and timeframes for how, when and by whom contractor change requests will be processed for AHCCCS members outside of contractor choice offered upon initial enrollment and the Annual Enrollment Choice (AEC) period. This affects: The member. The member's current/relinquishing contractor. The receiving contractor. AHCCCS. Criteria for Change of Contractor Outside of Initial Enrollment or AEC Period Contractor change requests outside of initial enrollment or the member's AEC period will be granted for members if certain conditions are met. These conditions are: Administrative Actions That May Merit A Contractor Change -A member was entitled to freedom of choice but was not sent an auto-assignment/freedom of choice notice. -A member was entitled to participate in an AEC but: Was not sent an AEC notice, or Was sent an AEC notice but could not take part due to circumstances beyond the member's control. -Family members were inadvertently enrolled with different contractors through the auto-assignment process. Upon receipt of notification by AHCCCS, the member who was wrongly enrolled will be disenrolled from the contractor of assignment and enrolled in the contractor where the other family members are enrolled. Other family members may not change to the contractor to which the new member was auto-assigned. This process does not apply if a member was afforded an enrollment choice during their AEC period. -A member who was enrolled with a contractor, lost eligibility and was disenrolled, then was subsequently redetermined eligible and reenrolled with a different contractor within 90 days from the date of disenrollment. In this case, the member will be reenrolled with the contractor they were enrolled with prior to the loss of eligibility. If this does not occur, AHCCCS, upon notification, will enroll the member with the correct contractor.Chapter 11 Member Rights and Responsibilities95 Arizona Medicaid, CRS, DD, LTC and EPD Provider Manual Confidential and Proprietary UHCCommunityPlan.com/UHCprovider .com Copyrighted by UnitedHealthcare 2018Chapter 11 Member Rights and Responsibilities -Newborns will automatically be assigned to the mother's contractor. If the mother is Title XIX or Title XXI-eligible, she will be given 30 days from notification to select another contractor for the newborn. Newborns of Federal Emergency Services (FES) mothers will be auto-assigned, and the mother will be given 30 days to select another contractor. -Adoption subsidy children will be auto-assigned, and the guardian will be given 30 days from notification to select another contractor. -A Title XIX-eligible member who is entitled to freedom of choice but becomes eligible and is auto-assigned prior to having the full choice period of 30 days will be allowed to request a contractor change following auto-assignment. The member will be given 30 days to request a contractor change. A member who does not make a selection within 30 days will remain with the auto-assigned contractor. Medical Continuity of Prenatal Care A pregnant member enrolled with a contractor through auto-assignment or freedom of choice but who is receiving or has received prenatal care from a provider who is affiliated with another contractor may be granted a medical continuity contractor change if the medical directors of both contractors agree. If other individuals in the pregnant member's family are also AHCCCS-eligible and enrolled, they may remain with the current contractor or transition to the new one if the medical continuity plan change is granted. The member may not return to the original contractor or change to another after the medical continuity contractor change has been granted except during the AEC period. Members who transition to a new contractor or become enrolled during their third trimester must be allowed to complete maternity care with their current AHCCCS- registered care provider, regardless of contractual status, to help ensure continuity of care. Medical Continuity of Care AHCCCS has standards for network composition that result in uniform availability and accessibility of services from all contractors serving a specific geographic area. In unique situations, contractor changes may be approved on a case-by-case basis to help ensure the member has access to care. A plan change for medical continuity is not an automatic process. The member's PCP, or other care provider, must provide documentation to both the receiving and relinquishing contractors that supports the need for a contractor change. The contractors must be reasonable in the request for documentation. However, the burden of proof that a contractor change is necessary rests with the member's medical provider. The contractor change must be approved by both contractor medical directors.When the medical directors of both contractors cannot agree, the relinquishing contractor will submit the request to the AHCCCS chief medical officer (CMO) or designee. The AHCCCS Acute Care Change of Contractor Form (Attachment A) and the supporting documentation must be sent to the AHCCCS DHCM/Medical Management Manager within 14 business days from the date of the original request. The results of the review will be shared with both medical directors. The relinquishing contractor must issue a final decision to the member. If the member request is denied, the relinquishing contractor will send the member a Notice of Adverse Benefit Determination.

UnitedHealthcare Community Plan Quality Management (QM) Program establishes the standards that encompass all quality improvement activities within the health plan. The following three pillars support our success in this endeavor: Clinical quality and excellence. Access and affordability. Customer service and operational excellence. The program's components involve: Measuring performance against established benchmarks for quality improvement (clinical and non-clinical) as identified by the QM program and activities identified in the QM work plan. Reviewing the quality and utilization of clinical care and service, including inpatient and outpatient care provided by hospitals, care providers and ancillary care providers. Helping ensure compliance with applicable regulatory and contractual requirements, including state and federal regulations. Identifying and targeting specific member populations when appropriate, such as AHCCCS, DDD, CRS, ALTCS EPD or Medicare. Analyzing, identifying, and addressing: -Opportunities to improve quality of care - continuity and coordination of care. -Areas of under- and overutilization - areas that will improve patient safety - member and provider satisfaction. -Access to and availability of care. Soliciting member and care provider input on performance and QM activities. The QM program coordinates with Utilization Management and care coordination activities. This involves: Implementing a process to help ensure a \"best effort\" attempt has been made to conduct an initial health assessment of each member's health care needs, including follow-up on unsuccessful attempts to contact a member within 90 days of enrollment. Informing members of specific health care needs that require follow-up and providing, as appropriate, training in self-care and other measures they may take to promote their own health. Implementing procedures for members with special health care needs, including: -Identifying members with special health care needs. -Helping ensure assessment by an appropriate health care professional. -Identifying medical procedures to address and/or monitor the need or condition -Helping ensuring adequate care coordination among providers. -Allowing direct access to a specialist as appropriate. Quality of Care Complaints and Concerns UnitedHealthcare Community Plan Quality Management receives potential quality of care concern referrals from multiple sources, including but not limited to: Members Utilization Management department Case Management department Care providers Regulators Quality of care (QOC) concerns can include but are not limited to: Delays in treatment, diagnosis or service Unexpected death Access/availability of care Medication errors Surgical or clinical procedural error HCAC Member abuse, neglect, exploitation Clinical QOC issues will be investigated by licensed personnel to identify if the allegation is a deviation from standard of care (substantiated) or not. Depending on the severity of the deviation, the case, after review by one of our medical directors, will be presented at the Provider Advisory Committee (PAC) for peer review. Aggregating QOC concerns assists with Chapter 13 Quality Management 102 Arizona Medicaid, CRS, DD, LTC and EPD Provider Manual Confidential and Proprietary UHCCommunityPlan.com/UHCprovider .com Copyrighted by UnitedHealthcare 2018Chapter 13 Quality Management identification of opportunities for improvement within the care provider network. A quarterly summary by care provider is run for all closed QOC concerns. This aggregated data is reviewed for trends by the QM licensed personnel and presented at the PAC and QM Committee. If a trend is noted, both Committees may determine further actions are needed to address the trend. Peer Review Peer review is the mechanism to review suspected substandard or inappropriate care or inappropriate professional behavior by a care provider while providing care to a UnitedHealthcare Community Plan member. If the findings of an investigation show a care provider has potentially provided substandard or inappropriate care, or has exhibited inappropriate professional conduct, we will refer such cases to the PAC for peer review. The PAC may develop a CAP with time frames for improvement, education, counseling, monitoring and trending of data. In addition, recommendations to the Quality Management Committee (QMC) for contract termination and/or referral to the appropriate state, federal or regulatory agencies may be made. All peer review information is confidential. You may file a grievance as a formal appeal as the result of a peer review decision with the medical director. Please see the Appeals and Grievance section of this manual for proper submission guidelines. The medical director must report to the appropriate licensing board any concerns regarding UnitedHealthcare Community Plan network care providers.

For purposes of reimbursements, AHCCCS has adopted HCPCS code T1015 for reporting physical health, behavioral health and dental visits. This procedure code should be reported on CMS Form 1500 claim forms and ADA claim forms. A claim for an FQHC, FQHC-LA, or RHC visit must include all appropriate procedure codes describing the services rendered in addition to visit code T1015.107 Arizona Medicaid, CRS, DD, LTC and EPD Provider Manual Confidential and Proprietary UHCCommunityPlan.com/UHCprovider .com Copyrighted by UnitedHealthcare 2018Chapter 14 Billing and Encounter Submission A visit will be identified by, and reimbursement for the visit, will be associated with, HCPCs code T1015.

Further billing instructions are available in the AHCCCS Fee-For-Service Provider Manual. Billing Service for Medicare Dual Complete UnitedHealthcare Community Plan's claim system automatically processes first the Medicare Dual Complete claims then creates a claim copy and adjudicates the Medicare (secondary) claim. This eliminates the need to submit a secondary claim. Participating care providers in our Medicare Dual Complete product should continue to submit all FQHC/RHC medical claims on a CMS 1500, billing appropriate Medicare codes as well as the AHCCCS T1015 code. Billing Services for Long-Term Care Claims submitted to UnitedHealthcare Community Plan LTC will have all other services denied with a denial code of 0059 - Svc included in Primary Procedure.

Inpatient Hospital DRG - Based Payment Inpatient hospital claims are reimbursed per an All Patient Refined - Diagnosis Related Group (APR-DRG)-based payment system. This affects all acute/general hospitals under provider type 02. The same payment methodology will be used for both in and out-of-state hospitals. Rehabilitation and LTC hospitals are split to a new care provider type and are paid under a per diem rate. Claims for inpatient services covered by a RBHA or T/RBHA, where the primary diagnosis upon admission is a behavioral health diagnosis, are reimbursed as indicated by ADHS. The APR- DRG does not apply to certain hospital types: Claims from a free-standing rehabilitation facility Claims from a free-standing LTC facility -Claims paid both a per diem rate with outlier provision Claims from a free-standing psychiatric facility -These are paid a per diem rate established by ADHS. Claims from an Indian Health Service Facility or tribally operated 638 facility -These are paid at the OMB rate.

Acceptable Claim Forms We require you to use one of two forms when billing for services. This is regardless of whether you are capitated for fee-for-service as per AHCCCS requirements and guidelines. All paper claims submitted are required to be submitted on the 02/12 1500 Claim Form. The 02/12 1500 Claim Form is for all professional services, including ancillary services, ambulatory surgery centers, urgent care centers, professional services billed by a hospital and other providers as required by AHCCCS. A UB-04 form is used to submit claims for hospital inpatient and outpatient services, dialysis services, skilled nursing homes inpatient services, LTC facilities, hospice services and other providers as required by AHCCCS. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan will not process claims received on any other type of claim form. All AHCCCS billing guidelines and requirements must be followed. ICD-10 coding is required in compliance with federal regulations. Submit behavioral health claims and medical record attachments electronically, if possible. Paper claims can also be submitted to: Optum P.O. Box 30760 Salt Lake City, UT 84130-0760 Group ID Numbers UnitedHealthcare Community Plan added a Group ID number to the Member ID cards: AHCCCS/Medicaid, CRS, and DD. If submitting the member's group ID number, please submit in box 11 of 1500 claims form or box 62 of UB-04 claim form. See Chapter 3 for a list of applicable group numbers.

This applies to the application of max-unit guidelines, age/gender guidelines, place of service/procedure combinations, duplicate claim billing, duplicate line-item, and revenue/procedure/modifier combination guidelines. Social Determinants The AHCCCS has found that using specific ICD-10 diagnosis codes representing Social Determinants of Health is a valuable source of information that affects member health. As appropriate, routinely screen for, and document, the presence of social determinants. Provide identified social determinant diagnosis codes on all claims for Community Plan members to comply with state and federal coding requirements beginning with dates of service on and after April 1, 2018. More information about social determinant ICD-10 coding may be found on the AHCCCS website at azahcccs.gov. For further information, please refer online at UHCCommunityPlan.com or your local provider advocate. Billing Multiple Units Reminders when billing multiple units: If the same procedure is provided multiple times on the same date of service, the procedure code must be entered once on the claim form with the appropriate number of units. The units field should specify the number of times the procedure was performed on the date of service. The total bill charge is the unit charge multiplied by the number of units. Ambulance Claims Ambulance claims must include both the ambulance point of origin and destination address, city, state, and ZIP in box 32 of the HCFA form. The accident state must be listed in box 10 and ambulance claims must not bill diagnosis code 799.99. National Drug Code Submit the National Drug Code (NDC) on all claims with procedure codes for physician-administered drugs in outpatient clinical settings. Claims must include NDC and unit of measurement for the drug billed, HCPCS/CPT code and units Chapter 14 Billing and Encounter Submission110 Arizona Medicaid, CRS, DD, LTC and EPD Provider Manual Confidential and Proprietary UHCCommunityPlan.com/UHCprovider .com Copyrighted by UnitedHealthcare 2018of service for the drug billed and actual metric decimal quantity administered. Copayments, Coinsurance and Deductibles Depending on the member's coverage type, the member might be responsible for some of the cost of behavioral health services such as copayments, coinsurance and/or deductible. Bill members for deductibles after claims processing yields an EOB indicating member responsibility. For copayments, we encourage you to require payment at the time of service if a copayment is due. You must collect member payments due to you. Do not charge members before delivering services. Benefit plans often provide for annual copayment or coinsurance maximums. Balance Billing for Covered Services Under the terms of the agreement, you may not balance billUnitedHealthcare Community Plan members for covered services provided during eligible visits, which means you may not charge members the difference between your billed usual and customary charges and the aggregate amount reimbursed by us and member expenses. Clean Claims and Timely Claim Submission Requirements A \"clean claim\" is defined in the Arizona Revised Statutes as one that can be processed without obtaining additional information from the provider of service or from a third party. It does not include a claim from a care provider under investigation for fraud or abuse or a claim selected for medical review by UnitedHealthcare Community Plan. We require the initial claim submission occur within deadlines set forth in your contract. You have one year from the date of service to correct and resubmit claims if the initial submission time period has been met. Not adhering to these requirements will result in a denial. Mail initial claims, medical record attachments and encounters to: UnitedHealthcare Community Plan P.O. Box 5290 Kingston, NY 12402-5290 Timely Filing Guidelines Consult your contract to determine your initial filing requirement. We will not pay a claim initially submitted more than six months after the end date of service, inpatient claims date of discharge or date of eligibility posting, whichever is later. We will not pay a clean claim submitted more than 12 months after date of service unless a shorter time period is specified in the contract or as directed by AHCCCS. Claim payment requirements pertain to both participating and non-participating care providers. The receipt date of the claim is the date stamp on the claim. The date electronically received or the date we receive the claim. Date of payment is the paid date on the check or other form of payment. Claims submission deadlines is calculated from the claim end date of service, inpatient claim date of discharge or the effective date of eligibility posing, whichever is later. Secondary claims must be received within six months from the date of service, even if the primary carrier has not made payment. If the primary carrier makes payment after the six-month time limit, you must resubmit a corrected claim with the primary EOB. Reconsideration Process We are committed to improving the experience on all reconsiderations. Within this informal request, a full medical necessity review is performed without the need to file a formal claim dispute. This offers a faster turnaround time and ease of submission with the ability to submit the request online or by Provider Services. Use the reconsideration process before submitting a claims dispute so that the claim can be reviewed for payment. Some denials appropriate for reconsideration are: No authorization on file/lack of medical necessity Exceeds timely filing Denied for additional documentation Denied for coordination of benefits information Resubmission of corrected claim Previously processed but rate applied incorrectly resulting in over/under payment Resubmission of a bundled claim Include all appropriate and pertinent documentation to support the services provided when submitting the reconsideration request. Reconsiderations can be submitted either online through Link, by calling Provider Services, or by mailing with a Reconsideration Form to the appropriate claims and medical record mailing address as shown on the back of the member's ID card.

Billing Guidelines for Transplants We require the transplant centers to coordinate and prepare the transplant packet containing all invoices for services related to the transplant. No invoices are to be billed outside the transplant packet by subcontractors or non-transplant department within the transplant organization. Claims not included in the packet will be denied. Care Provider Responsibilities Coordinate all professional services associated with the referenced transplantation services. Help ensure and facilitate all required referrals and evaluations needed to complete the pre-transplant evaluation process in a timely manner once the member is referred to the center as a possible candidate. Not providing medical documentation or obtaining prior authorization may result in denial of reimbursement. In a timely fashion, provide all information/documentation requested at no additional charge. Help ensure subcontracted care providers do not bill the health plan directly for service reimbursed under this contract. Submit claims within six months of the date of service for all services provided to AHCCCS members relating to covered organ and tissue transplant services. Contractors are paid at the contracted rates in effect for each covered component after the invoices for all medically necessary services relating to the at component have been submitted to AHCCCS and meet the clean claim criteria pursuant to A.R.S. 36-2904(H). Bill all medically necessary services provided to the transplant recipient related to the transplant using the appropriate diagnosis/CPT codes (see FFS Provider Manual, Chapter 24 on the AHCCCS website.) and procedure/revenue codes, as appropriate to meet clean claim status: -UB-04 (Form B) - All contracted transplant services provided by the facility, including accommodation days, organ acquisition, and related inpatient or outpatient hospital services must be submitted on the UB-04 form using the proper revenue codes and bill types. Services must be itemized as they would be on any non-transplant Chapter 14 Billing and Encounter Submission116 Arizona Medicaid, CRS, DD, LTC and EPD Provider Manual Confidential and Proprietary UHCCommunityPlan.com/UHCprovider .com Copyrighted by UnitedHealthcare 2018encounter and must not include physician or other non-facility services. -HCFA 1500 (Form A) - All physician and other professional services provided as part of the transplant contract, including transportation and medical supplies must be submitted on the HCFA 1500 form using the proper CPT and HCPCS procedure codes. Services must be itemized as they would be on any non-transplant encounter. -Universal Drug (Form C) - Submit on Form C any prescription drugs covered under the transplant contract. Hospital and Clinic Method of Billing Professional Services AHCCCS billing policy requires hospital and clinics billing for professional services bill on a CMS 1500 with the servicing care provider's name in box 31 and your AHCCCS number in box 33. The \"pay to\" name in box 33 may be the hospital or clinic name, but the AHCCCS number must be that of the individual care provider. This number must be used on the CMS 1500 EXAMPLE: Dr. A is a participating physician with Good Care Hospital. The hospital does the billing for Dr. A for any services performed at the hospital. Dr. A's care provider number would be entered in box 33, but the address could be Good Care Hospital. Once UnitedHealthcare Community Plan receives the claim, the payment is made directly to the hospital. If Dr. A bills for services rendered at their private office, the address in box 33 would be the private address, and reimbursement would be made to the address. Call Provider Services for questions. Observation vs. Inpatient Reimbursement Guidelines Observation services are those reasonable and necessary services provided on a hospital's premises for evaluation to determine whether the member should be admitted for inpatient care, discharged or transferred to another facility. Observation services include the use of a bed, periodic monitoring by a hospital's nursing. If appropriate, it includes other staff who evaluates, stabilizes or treats medical conditions of a significant degree of instability and/or disability on an outpatient basis. Amount, Duration and Scope Observation must be ordered in writing by a physician, or other individual authorized by hospital staff bylaws to admit patients to the hospital or to order outpatient diagnostic tests or treatments. The medical record must document the basis for observation services: -Severity of the signs and symptoms of the member -Degree of medical uncertainty that the member may experience an adverse occurrence -Need for outpatient services diagnostic studies that assist in assessing whether the member should be admitted -The availability of diagnostic procedures at the time and location where the member presents -It is reasonable, cost-effective and medically necessary to evaluate a medical condition or to determine the need for inpatient admission -Length of stay for observation is medically necessary Inappropriate Use The following examples are considered inappropriate use of observation care: Substitution for physician-ordered inpatient services that are not reasonable, cost-effective and necessary for diagnosis or treatment Services provided solely for the convenience of the member or physician Excessive time and/or amount of services medically required by the condition of the member Services customarily provided in a hospital-based outpatient surgery center and not supported by medical documentation Reimbursement If the inpatient admission request does not meet inpatient criteria, we will review the case to see if it meets observation criteria. If the case meets observation criteria, the inpatient authorization will be denied. A claim note will be entered to pay the claim at observation. If the reimbursement for observation is greater than the inpatient rate, the claim will be reimbursed at the inpatient rate.

Resolving Claim Issues To resolve claim issues, call Provider Service first. Then use the online tools in Link on UHCprovider.com. Or resubmit the claim via mail with a Reconsideration Form. Allow up to 30 days for us to receive payment for initial claims and 45 days to receive a response to adjustment requests. Using these resources does not constitute the filing of a claim dispute. If you wish to file a dispute, refer to Chapter 15, Care Provider Claim Disputes, Member Appeals, and Grievances. All issues received in Provider Services will be acknowledged within three business days. You will be notified of resolution within 30 business days. Notification of Resolution is defined as telling you your issues have been resolved. It may include a detailed description of the actions to be taken and when to expect full resolution. Provider Central Service Unit The Provider Central Service Unit (PCSU) provides assistance for all our Dual Complete (HMO SNP) care providers to resolve escalated issues.

When calling the PCSU, provide the representative a detailed explanation of specific issues and what was expected under the terms of the contract. To contact PCSU, call 800-718-5360. Tips for Successful Claims Resolution Do not allow claim issues to accumulate or go unresolved. Your contracts only allow a limited time to request an adjustment or reconsideration. If you cannot verify that a claim is on file, contact Provider Services or their local advocate. Do not resubmit claims that have been validated as on file unless you are submitting a corrected claim. This will cause unnecessary duplicate denials. File claims disputes within contractual time requirements. When submitting adjustment requests, provide the same information required for a clean claim with pertinent medical documentation. Explain the dispute, what should have been paid, and why. Reason Code 151, \"Payment Denied/Reduced Info Does Not Support\" identifies the claim/service submitted has exceeded the maximum daily frequency allowed for the procedure. If exceeding the maximum daily frequency is required, submit the medical records justifying medical necessity. If you have questions about the maximum daily frequency of a CPT/HCPCS, review the Reimbursement Policies on UHCCommunityPlan.com. Or call Provider Services. Valid Proof of Timely Filing Attachments Below is a list of documents accepted as valid proof of timely filing: UnitedHealth Group correspondence (data entry send back letter) OR A computer-generated activity page/print screen listing the date the claim was submitted to UnitedHealthcare Community Plan. Submission must contain: -Member name and Identifying information -Date(s) of service -Billed amount -Date submitted to insurance Electronic Claims - Acceptance Report, must include: -Universal Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) acceptance code A1:19 coding and an acceptance date within the timely filing period, OR -A combination of a version of the words accepted by payer, acknowledged by payer or received by UnitedHealthcare Community Plan A billing statement indicating the date in which you found out the member had UnitedHealthcare Community Plan Other insurance carrier Denial/Rejection EOB or letter (e.g., terminated coverage, not their member) A letter from an obstetrical provider indicating they could not complete all the services required to bill the global code, as the patient was no longer in their care or lost coverage. Chapter 14 Billing and Encounter Submission119 Arizona Medicaid, CRS, DD, LTC and EPD Provider Manual Confidential and Proprietary UHCCommunityPlan.com/UHCprovider .com Copyrighted by UnitedHealthcare 2018 Primary carrier EOB showing payment. Date on EOB must be submitted within six months from date of service, even if primary carrier has not made payment. If you have received either a payment or a denial for payment with which you do not agree, UnitedHealthcare Community Plan has provided the following. Third-Party Resources Refer to your contract for submission deadlines concerning third-party claims. Once you have billed the other carrier and received an EOB, the claim may then be submitted to us. Please attach a copy of the EOB to the submitted claim. The EOB must be complete to understand the paid amount or the denial reason. You often have timely filing guidelines documented in your contract which indicate how many days from the date of service you have to submit claims to UnitedHealthcare Community Plan. If the timely filing deadline is approaching, and you have not received the EOB, submit the claim to UnitedHealthcare Community Plan without it to prevent a potential timely filing denial. A corrected claim or resubmission can be submitted once the primary carrier's EOB is received. Any claim received over 12 months from the date of service will be denied. Other carriers' requirements must be met, or the claim may be denied. Coordination of Benefit Standard COB Because UnitedHealthcare Community Plan is the payer of last resort, identify and verify any other insurance coverage for the member. Bill that insurer first. When billing UnitedHealthcare Community Plan, submit the primary payer's EOB or remittance advice with the claim. Secondary claims must be received within six months from the date of service, even if the primary carrier has not made payment. If the primary carrier makes payment after this time limit, a corrected claim must be resubmitted with the primary EOB. Claims are processed according to the AHCCCS Contractor Operations Manual (ACOM), Chapter 400, section 434. Medicare Dual Cost Sharing Some UnitedHealthcare Community Plan members are dual eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare. Claims for dual-eligible members will be paid according to the Medicare Cost-Sharing Policy. We are not responsible for cost-sharing should the payment to the primary payer be equal to or greater than what you would have received under Medicaid. Additional information regarding Medicare Cost Sharing is available in the Dual Complete Provider Manual.Billing Members If a member requests a service not covered by AHCCCS, have the member sign a release form indicating understanding that they are financially responsible for all applicable charges. This form must be signed before they receive services. Arizona Revised Statute \u00a736-2903.01 (K) prohibits care providers from billing AHCCCS recipients, including QMB-only recipients, for AHCCCS-covered services: Upon oral or written notice from the patient that they believe the claims to be covered by the AHCCCS system, a care provider or non-provider of health and medical services prescribed in \u00a736- 2907 should not do either of the following unless the care provider or non-provider has verified through the administration that the person has been determined ineligible, has not been determined eligible or was not eligible or enrolled at the time of services were rendered: 1. Charge, submit a claim to, or demand or otherwise collect payment from a member or person who has been determined eligible. 2. Refer or report a member or person who has been determined eligible to a collection agency or credit reporting agency for the failure of the member or person who has been determined eligible to pay charges for system covered care or services unless specifically pursuant to the statute. Note: \"QMB\" is a Qualified Medicare Beneficiary under the federal program but does not qualify for Medicaid. Under A.A.C. R9-29-301, AHCCCS will only reimburse the care provider for the Medicare deductible/copay/coinsurance amount when Medicare pays first.

Exclusions/Sanction/Debarment Checks You must review federal exclusion lists when hiring/contracting with employees/contractors, health care professionals, or vendors who work on Medicare Advantage, Part D or Medicaid programs to help ensure that none are excluded from participating in federal health care programs. For more information or access to the publicly accessible excluded party online databases, please see the following: Health and Human Services - Office of the Inspector General (HHS-OIG) List of Excluded Individuals/Entities oig.hhs.gov/ exclusions/index.asp. General Services Administration (GSA) List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Non-procurement programs is on the System for Award Measurement site, sams.gov/. What You Need to Do Review applicable exclusion/sanctions/debarment lists to help ensure that none of your employees or contractors is excluded from participation in federal health care programs. Addressing Fraud In accordance with your agreement, you are required to cooperate with the review process to include any requests for medical records. This includes but is not limited to outreach meetings and/ or written correspondence to care providers, record review and/ or site audit, individual case peer-to-peer reviews, and referral for further investigation. Once an intervention has occurred, we monitor the practice patterns of an identified care provider to help ensure the potential fraud, waste or abuse practice pattern has been corrected. In the event that we suspect fraud, waste and/or abuse, the allegation or complaint is forwarded for investigation. The investigation unit determines which claims are appropriate to review. In addition, suspicious billing patterns may be detected through established data tools and analysis. In general, identified claims, along with the care provider that submits these claims, are audited on a prospective basis. In accordance with our policy, audits of previously paid claims are completed on a retrospective basis. All prospective reviews are completed in a timely manner, prior to a payment determination, to assess whether they validate the initial allegation. Any claim submitted that matches suspected patterns under investigation may trigger a request for medical records. In some cases, additional investigative steps may be used to obtain accurate information related to a claim. Upon completion of the investigation, the claim is adjudicated. Either timely payment is made or, in the event that a claim denial is issued, the denial notification includes the care provider's standard dispute rights. Billing records should reflect the member who was treated, the rendering clinician and the modality of care. Audits related to claims, coding or billing issues may require corrective action. Findings of billing inconsistent with our policies by in-network care providers may result in such actions as clarification of proper Chapter 16 Fraud and Abuse 124 Arizona Medicaid, CRS, DD, LTC and EPD Provider Manual Confidential and Proprietary UHCCommunityPlan.com/UHCprovider .com Copyrighted by UnitedHealthcare 2018procedure, a CAP, a change in network availability status, or may result in termination of your provider agreement. In the case of retrospective review, we and our payers reserve the right to pursue recoupment of funds paid. The Credentialing Committee may recommend termination. In that event, the care provider is notified in writing and provided with information about appeal rights, if applicable, and in compliance with state and federal laws. As warranted, care providers will be reported to the Arizona Department of Insurance, licensing board(s), and any other regulatory agencies based on the outcome of the investigation and as required by state and federal laws. Throughout this process, we adhere to state law, ERISA guidelines, and confidentiality standards. Integrity of Claims, Reports and Representation to Government Entities A number of federal and state regulations govern information provided to the government, including the Federal False Claims Act, State False Claims Acts and other regulations and protections. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan requires compliance with the requirements of federal and state laws that prohibit the submission of false claims in connection with federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Federal and state governments have adopted a number of statutes to deter and punish misrepresentations with regard to health care programs. Failure to comply with these laws could result in civil and criminal sanctions imposed by government entities and UnitedHealthcare Community Plan. Federal False Claims Act The federal False Claims Act prohibits knowingly submitting (or causing to be submitted) to the federal government a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval. It also prohibits knowingly making or using (or causing to be made or used) a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by a state Medicaid program, the federal government or its agents, such as a carrier or other claims processor. Civil penalties can be imposed on any person or entity that violates the federal False Claims Act, including monetary penalties of $5,500 to $11,000 as well as damages of up to three times the federal government's damages for each false claim.Federal Fraud Civil Remedies The Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act of 1986 also allows the government to impose civil penalties against any person who makes, submits or presents false, fictitious or fraudulent claims or written statements to designated federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which is the federal agency that oversees the Medicare and Medicaid Programs. State False Claims Acts Several states, including Arizona, have enacted broad false claims laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act or have legislation pending that is similar to the federal False Claims Act. Other states have enacted false claims laws that have provisions limited to health care fraud. Whistleblower and Whistleblower Protections The federal False Claims Act and some state false claims acts permit private citizens with knowledge of fraud against the federal government or state government to file suit on behalf of the government against the person or business that committed the fraud. Individuals who fil such suits are known as a \"qui tam\" plaintiff or \"whistleblower.\" The federal False Claims Act and some state false claims acts also prohibit retaliation against an employee for investigating, filing or participating in a whistleblower action. Establish an effective training program for all your staff on the following aspects of the Federal False Claims Act provisions: The administrative remedies for false claims and statements Any state laws relating to civil or criminal penalties for false claims and statements The whistleblower protections under such laws -All training must be appropriately documented.
