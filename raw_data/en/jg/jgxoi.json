The partnership between TNK Therapeutics and Shenyang Sunshine Pharmaceutical Co. will include TNK's chimeric antigen receptor T cell (\"CAR-T\") technology, Sorrento Therapeutics said Tuesday. Chinese companies have become increasingly active in biotechnology during the past several years, with the encouragement and financial support of the Chinese government. Demographics is one reason: China's elderly population is expected to become a considerably bigger part of that nation's population in coming decades. Moreover, the Chinese government views biotechnology as an important investment area. It designed seven sectors in 2011, including biotechnology, that together would benefit from $1.7 trillion in funding from the government from 2011-15. And in biotech, CAR-T therapies represent one of the most promising new approaches to fighting cancer CAR-T therapies genetically engineer immune cells to seek out and destroy the cancer cells. Therapies have produced dramatic results in early-stage trials in patients with advanced forms of blood cancers, referred to as \"liquid tumors\". These immune cells have been taken from the patients themselves, genetically engineered and then re-infused into the patients. TNK has developed versions of CAR-T that uses \"off the shelf\" cells, which could lower costs by employing economies of scale. One version targets CEA-positive cancers, which are solid tumors. CEA, or carcinoembryonic antigen, is a protein generated by certain cancers, such as colorectal, breast, pancreatic and ovarian cancers. It is normally produced during fetal development. Terms of the joint venture calls for Shenyang Sunshine Pharmaceutical Co., or 3SBio, to contribute $10 million in return for 51 percent of the joint venture, with TNK owning the remainder. TNK will contribute an exclusive license to three versions of CAR-T, including the CEA version. TNK was formed in May 2015 to develop CAR-T therapies from technology developed with a partnership by Sorrento Therapeutics with Conkwest (now NantKwest), a company owned by billionaire biotech entrepreneur Patrick Soon-Shiong, M.D., [Soon-Shiong bought a 19.9 percent equity stake](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2014/dec/15/sorrento-therapeutics-soon-shiong/) in Sorrento Therapeutics in December 2014. Soon-Shiong recently became an investor in Tribune Publishing, the San Diego Union-Tribune's parent company, buying about 12.9 percent of the company. The CAR-T technologies used by TNK combines Sorrento Therapeutics' technology to make fully human antibodies with NantKwest's Neukoplast cell line. These are genetically engineered \"natural killer\" immune cells. In July, Sorrento Therapeutics [entered into a joint venture](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2015/jul/10/sorrento-therapeutics-cancer-soon-shiong/) with another of Soon-Shiong's companies, NantBioScience. The companies said they would contribute $100 million, with 60 percent from NantBioScience and the rest from Sorrento Therapeutics, with ownership divided in the same proportion. Shares of Sorrento Therapeutics closed Tuesday after the announcement at $6.69, down 19 cents for the day. "}
