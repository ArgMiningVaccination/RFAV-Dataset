ICT helps people to commu-nicate effectively, overcoming the limitations of time and space, empowerspeople by providing information and knowledge, provides income generat-ing and learning opportunities, increases government transparency andefficiency, and enables people to express their concerns and to activelyparticipate in decision-making processes. ICT penetration and application vary significantly across the region that makes the benefits of ICT not universal, leading to the creation of thedigital divide between and within countries. Therefore, the challenges facedby various stakeholders and international organizations are to narrow thedigital gap and create digital opportunities by providing people withequitable, affordable, quality and universal access to ICT. The community e-centre (CeC) or telecentre is one way of providing access to ICT to rural communities. CeCs provide access to telephones,faxes, computers, the Internet, photocopiers and other equipment and ser-vices. They enable communities to access new knowledge and informationthat can be incorporated with local knowledge. Examples of services ofsuch centres include provision of information on job and employmentopportunities, education information, government services (e.g. providinglinks to e-government) and technical information on agriculture for theirdaily lives such as information on new varieties, planting techniques, anddisease prevention. In these ways, they serve as \"virtual roads\" or commu-nication highways. Some Centres are used as training centres for localpeople to learn computer and ICT skills. The staff are typically used asintermediary persons to find information. Many CeCs are located in schoolsand libraries where information services can be easily offered. CeCs canalso be used for commercial transactions by small, medium and microenterprises by setting up e-business web sites. The Workshop on Building e-Community Centres for Rural Develop- ment was held in Bali, Indonesia, from 8 to 14 December 2004. The mainobjective of this Workshop was to examine the various issues related toCeCs in the Asia and the Pacific region and share good practices that canbe used as models for successful development and operation of thesecentres. During the Workshop, participants discussed and reviewed the keyconcepts, approaches and challenges for the operation and establishingCeCs and also shared their own experiences.PrefaceivThe Workshop was co-organized by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN ESCAP) and theAsian Development Bank Institute (ADBI).

ORGANIZATION OF THE WORKSHOP A. Organization The Regional Workshop on Building e-Community Centre was jointly organized by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and Pacific (UN ESCAP) and the Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI)from 8 to 14 December 2004 in Bali, Indonesia. The Global Development Learning Network (GDLN) Centre at University of Udayana in Bali, Indonesia provided facilities for the Workshop. The Government of theRepublic of Korea, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Asia-Pacific Satellite Communications Council (APSCC), International Business Machine (IBM), International Rice Research Institution (IRRI) and Microsoft Corpo-ration provided resource speakers for the Workshop. B. Objectives of the Workshop A community centre, which is equipped with ICT to provide informa- tion services is commonly referred to as a community e-centre 1 (CeC, also referred to as a telecenter, tele-cottage, cyber caf\u00e9, or information kiosk). CeCs have sprung up across developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region at a rapid rate. The growing need to become part of the knowledgesociety or knowledge economy has encouraged many countries to take this initiative. Developing the community e-centre is not only about providing ICT equipment, but also understanding the needs of the people who woulduse them, and providing locally useful information content and applications in local languages. In many cases, these centres have been established by development agencies on a pilot basis and often their sustainability is notguaranteed after the initial project period. Experiences show that employment of proper technology, community ownership through participatory development approach, capacity of commu-nity in the use of ICT, and private sector operation contribute to sustainability of the centres. However, there are not enough studies on the issues of how to set up and how to sustain them. Therefore, there is a need to examine variousissues related to community e-centres to develop guidelines or models for successful development and operation of these centres for developing countries to reap the most benefits from ICT for rural development. In recognition of this need, the objective of the Workshop was to: Share experiences of e-community centers for rural development in participating countries Examine issues in operating and establishing e-community cen-ters in rural areas 1In this publication \"e-community \"community e-centre\" are being inter-changeably and refered to as community e-centre or CeC.Organization of the Workshop 3Develop business plans and models for sustainable e-community centers in rural areas Identify policies that can effectively promote community e-centers C. Opening of the Workshop The welcome remarks was made by the Chief, ICT Applications Section, Information, Communication and Space Technology Division, UN ESCAP. She stated that the Asian and Pacific region was home to over 60per cent of world's population, of which more than 60 per cent live in rural areas. Access to ICTs in rural areas was difficult owing to weak telecommu- nications infrastructure, high cost of access to ICT, low skill levels and thelack of awareness on the role of ICTs for development. Therefore, the Plan of Action of the first phase of the World Summit on Information Society (WSIS) recommended establishing rural ICT access points to achieve theInformation Society and CeCs were one way of doing this. She described the CeC as a physical space that provides public access to ICTs for the educational, personal, social and economic development of the community.She said that experiences show there is demand for and acceptance of CeC initiatives. This demand indicated that CeCs produced positive results in improving the socio-economic situations of the people in the community.She expressed the confidence that the Workshop would serve as a forum forthe participants to exchange information and to learn from each other about their knowledge and experience with respect to CeCs. Mr. I.G.B Wijaya Kusuma, Director of the University of Udayana Global Development Learning Network (GDLN) said it was a great honour for their centre to host this important regional Workshop. Mr. Kusuma said the potential of ICT had only recently become evident to their University.Having become aware of its potential through a similar Workshop in Thailand last year, Mr. Kusuma said his University hoped to connect their campus with the rest of the world using ICTs. The University's own ICT centre was still inthe development stage, and Mr. Kusuma hoped his University would benefit from hosting the Workshop, which would give GDLN an opportunity, similar to the participants, to learn from the resource speakers as well. Mr. Ray Renfro, Director, Capacity Building and Training for the ADBI, made his opening remarks by video link from Tokyo, Japan. Mr. Renfro said ADB and ADBI were committed to reducing the digital divideand poverty, and one strategy to help achieve this was through CeCs. Mr. Renfro said that CeCs served as \"virtual roads\" or communication highways and that ADB was pilot testing numerous CeCs around the region. Mr.Renfro said that CeCs enabled communities to access new knowledge and information that could be incorporated with local knowledge. Further, some CeCs were used as training centres for local people to learn computer andICT skills. Mr. Renfro said that through this workshop he hoped participants would obtain the latest knowledge on CeCs based on lectures and case studies, examine key issues and policy ramifications in establishing andOrganization of the Workshop 4operating CeCs in the context of their country, learn from each other the experiences on CeCs, and draft action plans to improve CeCs in their country. Dr. Jeoung-Keun Lee from ADBI noted that the speakers for the Workshop were experts in the field of ICT and development of rural CeCs.He said that, as such, they would be able to share much with theparticipants about recent trends, models and practices. Dr. Lee explained that the Workshop would enable participants to share experiences on CeCs, examine issues in establishing and operating CeCs, develop business models for sustainable CeCs and draft action plans (project proposals) to promote CeCs. D. Attendance A total of 23 participants from 17 developing countries in the Asian and Pacific region participated in the Workshop. The participants weredecision makers in Government ministries, such as IT, telecommunications,economics, finance, agriculture, and regional and urban planning. Threeself-financed observers from Nepal also attended the Workshop. E. Election of officers The Workshop elected the following persons to serve as officers: Chairperson: Mr. Ashis Sanyal (India) Vice Chairperson: Mr. Zainal Arifin (Indonesia) F. Recommendations of the Workshop The Workshop reaffirmed that community e-centres (CeCs) were viable means to provide access to ICT and to be used as a tool to acquireessential information and knowledge for rural community development. Itwas also noted that the establishment of CeCs can narrow the digital dividebetween rural and urban areas and contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). To promote the development of CeCs in the developing economies in the Asian and Pacific region, theWorkshop adopted the following recommendations: 1. All people should have the necessary skills to fully participate in and benefit from the Information Society. To enable thebenefits of ICT to reach rural communities, Governments and other stakeholders, including international organizations, donor agencies and the private sector, are encouraged to assist coun-tries in building capacity in the use of ICT and facilitate theestablishment of community access points in rural areas usingappropriate technologies; 2. International organizations, donor agencies and countries with advanced levels of e-readiness should support developing coun- tries, particularly countries in the region with low levels of ICTdevelopment, to reduce poverty through the development andapplication of ICTs;Organization of the Workshop 53. Universal access to ICT should be a priority, and Governments should consider CeCs in the context of national development policies and strategies and should regard commensurate invest- ment in CeCs as social investment; 4. Public-private partnership should be encouraged at all stages of CeC development to improve the sustainability of CeCs, includ- ing the development of local content and applications, andtraining; 5. Available training modules, common content and applications, should be shared among CeCs to minimize the duplication ofefforts and to share limited resources. A network of implement- ing agencies should be established to share these resources and experiences, and to solve common problems. International orga-nizations including UN ESCAP, ADBI and ADB should develop mechanisms to establish and maintain such a network; 6. To make CeCs more relevant to rural communities, all stake- holders should devote more efforts to local translation and adaptation to create locally relevant content; and 7. An annual regional meeting should be held, and other institu- tional mechanisms suitable to participations developed, to facili- tate this sharing. UN ESCAP, ADBI and ADB are requested to seek funds for this purpose. II. PROCEEDINGS OF THE WORKSHOP A. Overview of community e-centres in Asia and the Pacific Chief, ICT Applications Section, UN ESCAP Background - the Digital Divide The vision of the Information Society identified at the First Phase of the World Summit on Information Society (WSIS) is one which is people-centred, inclusive and development-oriented and where everyone can create, access, utilize and share information and knowledge. To achieve this vision of the Information Society, the WSIS Plan of Action recommended to: Establish rural information, communication and technology (ICT) access points Empower communities, especially those in rural and underserved areas, through the use of ICTs Promote distance learning, training and other forms of educa- tion as part of capacity building programmes Promote international and regional cooperation for capacity buildingOverview of community e-centres in Asia and the Pacific 6Access to appropriate information and knowledge contributes signifi- cantly to economic development and to ensure access to information, ICTis a key enabler. ICT provides an economic and efficient means to acquire information and knowledge. In recognition of this need for information, the WSIS Plan of Action states: \"ICTs allow people, anywhere in the world, to access infor- mation and knowledge almost instantaneously. Individuals,organizations and communities should benefit from access to knowledge and information.\" Between 1992 and 2002, ICT penetration increased significantly in developing countries (figure 1). While the gap is narrowing across all typesof ICT indicators, the gap still exists between developed and developing countries. The digital divide within countries and between different commu- nities must also be addressed before ICTs can deliver on their promise. Developed Developing 100% 2002 Source : ITU 2003, World Telecommunications Report 2003. Figure 1. The digital divide Rural challenges Rural and remote communities have less access to ICTs compared to their urban counterparts. In Asia, the majority of population do not live inurban areas, but are farmers, often living in under-developed and isolated areas. Rural areas are characterized by the following challenges: Low infrastructure for ICT usage Long distance to maintain and repair ICTsOverview of community e-centres in Asia and the Pacific 7Small market size Low affordability, literacy and ICT literacy Low awareness of opportunities and benefits of ICT To provide equitable access to ICTs to rural communities, Govern- ments and civil society organizations have set up community e-centres(CeCs) in rural areas. A CeC is a facility that provides public access to ICT-based services and applications for education, personal, social and economic development. The concept originated in Sweden around 1985. It has now expanded toinclude telecentres, telecottages, community technology centres, community communication shops, village centres, networked learning cen- tres, multipurpose community telecentres digital club houses. CeCs provide ICT-based services in rural and remote areas. They provide opportunities for development through ICT; extend the reach of public services such as education, health and social services; provideinformation of interest to the local community including farmers, local businesses and NGOs; and create new enterprises and jobs opportunities. The key is providing public access. The typical facilities of CeC include: Telecommunications facilities (telephones, faxes) Office equipment (computers, CD-ROMs, printers, photocopiers) Multimedia hardware and software (radio, TV , video) Location for meetings and training Services provided by CeCs include: Communication (telephone, fax, e-mail, Internet and radio) ICT training Agricultural information dissemination E-learning Distance health care E-government services Small and micro-enterprise support There is no universally accepted model or optimal size for CeCs. Every CeC operates with different objectives, services and ICT applicationsunder different conditions. There are four different models - the adoption model, the government model, the commercial model and the school model. CeCs are now being seen as a viable method for bridging the digital divide and means to providing access to ICTs to communities, which havebeen left behind in the shift to an Information Society. In light of this, Governments in the region have developed national policies including the development of CeCs that aim to bridge knowledge, social and economic gaps.Overview of community e-centres in Asia and the Pacific 8Development of CeCs For developing CeCs, communities or organizations must first: Assess the needs of the community - Needs assessment should identify information needs, identify stakeholders and their role, and help to create a sense of ownership Select the service and application - Services and applications vary according to community. The types of services includebasic telecommunication service, information services, e-learn-ing, e-business, e-government and training Develop content and applications - Perhaps the most valuable function of CeCs is the dissemination of information and knowl- edge for development. CeC content can include: information onfarm product prices and input prices (quality seeds/fertilisers); adirectory of general and crop insurance schemes; bus/train time-tables; information on sea conditions; enabling online registra-tion of applications for all sorts of revenue related transactions; online public grievance systems; expert consultations; village newsletters, employment news and so on. To reach the ruralpoor, the content should be relevant to the local situation - ifit's not relevant it will not be used. Therefore, it must bewritten in local language, supported by multi-media, such as voice and image for illiterate people Select technologies - Satellite technology provides a rapid and increasingly cost-effective method of achieving connectivity inremote rural areas. Very small aperture terminal (VSAT) is aparticularly good option for rural communities that are toodistant from fibre backbones or terrains too rough for the line of sight required between terrestrial microwave antennas. Another alternative is the Wireless Local Loop (WLL) for rural areaswithin microwave radio reach of existing fibre optic cable links.The use of wireless networks, and in particular WiFi, has drawna lot of attention as a relatively low-cost way of getting fastnetwork access to rural areas. WiFi is not the only wireless networking technology - packet radio, microware links and even 3G phone networks could all do a similar job Provide training Operate and manage Conduct monitoring and evaluation To capitalize on the potential of this technology, low cost PCs (e.g. simputers, Pengachu (Thailand's low cost computers) and PDAs) need to be developed. An innovative mix of technology to maximize connectivity and to minimize the costs is also needed, and to overcome low literacy rates, CeCs need to employ technologies for easy interaction (e.g. voice recogni- tion, oral or audiovisual output).Overview of community e-centres in Asia and the Pacific 9Problems identified There are many challenges to overcome in setting up CeCs, including the high costs involved in the establishment (initial investment and recurrentcosts) of the centres. The most significant capital costs in offering community ICT services are for hardware and network access equipment. Business plans should factor in the depreciation of equipment; slow service take-up; the highcost of repair and maintenance in remote settings; and potential power,security and technical problems. The possibility of deploying low-cost PCsneed to be examined. To reduce the recurrent costs (rent, electricity, salary ofstaff), many telecentres hire secondary and tertiary students at low wages to serve as facilitators and perform other tasks such as repair and research, and setup the centre within an existing business (e.g. telephone call centres,temples, school, post office, government offices). Another obstacle is the limitation of ICT skilled people. Training in operation and maintenance needs to be provided for the CeCs operator. Awareness of the benefits of ICT also needs to be raised and policy andregulatory issues which impact on ICT usage need to be addressed. Access issues also need to be considered, such as giving careful thought to physical placement, design and staffing to serve men and women and different social groups. Key issues - sustainability When sustainability of a CeC is discussed, it is often interpreted as meaning self-financing and is equated with success. However, sustainabilityhas many other dimensions, such as social and cultural, political, techno-logical, and financial. Social and culture sustainability is measured by whether it empowers people in the community, meets the needs of various groups (men, women,young, old), and allows for community ownership and engagement. Political sustainability is measured in terms of whether a stable regulatory framework to promote and support CeCs has been secured.While technological sustainability is measured whether appropriate technol-ogy options were chosen for the community. Financial sustainability reflects whether a CeC has full financial viability. The centre should be able to recover its capital investment,operational expenses, and replace equipment as needed. A centre could alsobe partially financially sustainable only recovering operational expenses butnot the initial and future capital investment. Most successful projects are those which are either private sector driven or community driven with an emphasis on viability and responsive-ness. Furthermore experiences show that rural communities can pay for theservices and services that are charged for are usually more valued than those that are free.Overview of community e-centres in Asia and the Pacific 10Lessons learned - success factors Some of the key lessons learned so far are: 1. Community ownership is crucial: organizational structures should provide authority, responsibility and management of resources tothe community. 2. Locally relevant content/services should be designed and imple- mented to suit the needs of the community. 3. Technology options that provide affordable and universal local connectivity, including the use of multimedia (e.g. radio, video,TV etc.) need to be carefully examined. 4. Financial and operational sustainability need to be obtained over a period of time. The community-based introduction of ICTs takes time to establish in developing communities. In most developing communities, it will takelonger, between three to five years, which is more than what most donors expect for ICTs to actually become established and a sustainability path to be identified and concluded. Investing in community-based ICTs is a social investment - access to ICT tools requires a social investment to take root in developing communities. Increasingly, this is understood as a role for international development agencies to play in tandem with the private sector andinterested public institutions. Community-based ICTs help to \"make\" the market for CeCs by stimulating awareness, engender new skill development and build a marketfor the eventual development of ICT-based commercial services. Recommendations The development of CeCs should be viewed in the context of national ICT-enabled development strategies. To use limited resources moreefficiently, materials related to appropriate international models and goodpractices need to be collected and disseminated, and training materials andexperiences for problem solving and developing local content and databasesshould be shared through networking between CeCs. B. Bridging the digital divide - the satellite solution Mr. Eui-Kon Koh, President, the Asia-Pacific Satellite Communications Council How to narrow the digital divide One of the main contributing factors to the digital divide is the poor terrestrial network infrastructure. For instance, in China, over 400 millionkilometres of fibre optic cable has been laid, yet there still remain manyunreachable areas, such as remote or mountainous areas. It is not commerciallyviable to build a fibre optic service which is able to cover all of the country.Bridging the digital divide - the satellite solution 11The solution then is to build a better infrastructure. Satellite technol- ogy is the key for this, combined with more training (hardware - computeroperations, and software - Internet-related) along with community and government support. Satellites allow for fast infrastructure build-up, in terms of fast implementation, and it is scalable, in such that infrastructure can be built as networks grow. Unfortunately, satellite equipment is not as affordable as atelephone set. It is however, easy to install, taking less than two weeks to install - which is one of its main advantages. With satellites, there is also the ability to increase the capacity as needed, making it good for upscaling,enabling users to start with their minimum requirement and scale up as needed. The challenge to satellite technology application in the Asia-Pacific region is collaboration. Though there are major advancements in informa- tion technology (IT) development taking place in many countries in the region, when it comes to satellite technology, few are willing to collaboratewith each other, and every country wants to have its own satellite service rather than sharing resources, creating a problem in terms of overcapacity. Despite this, satellite remains perhaps the most promising potential solution to the digital divide. It can reach almost anywhere in the region, making global coverage a possibility. Furthermore, broadband can alsobecome more available through satellite and is easier to install. One of the obstacles to satellite is the cost of bandwidth but as the technology develops the cost of bandwidth is going down, as are equipment costs. Asia-Pacific Satellite Communications Council (APSCC) The Asia-Pacific Satellite Communications Council (APSCC) was founded to promote satellite communications and broadcasting in the Asia-Pacific region under the auspices of the United Nations Office for OuterSpace Affairs and supported by ITU. It has 100 members from Asia, Europe,and North America including satellite manufacturers, satellite operators,launch vehicle service providers, equipment vendors, consultants, and gov- ernment organizations. Membership is open to anyone who is interested in satellite communications, and is free to government organizations. The APSCC mission is to promote satellite communications in Asia- Pacific, provide a forum for discussion and interchange of information,ideas and new technologies in satellite communications, and coordinate theInternational Satcom standard. Asian satellite market overview Satellite technology is well suited to the Asia-Pacific region. Its utilization is expanding, particularly its use in emergency situations. Many regional and global satellite operators have satellites over the Asia-Pacific region, but as a result, overcapacity remains an issue in the region. Despitethis, revenue is continuing to grow due to the development and availabilityBridging the digital divide - the satellite solution 12of technology. If this is to continue, however, government regulatory issues will have to be addressed, and some of the regulatory barriers eased. Regional/domestic satellite operators In the past, having a satellite was, for many countries in Asia-Pacific, akin to having a national airline carrier. It was important for every country to have one airline carrier, and demonstrate that it was not dependent on other nations to fly its nationals. The need for each country to have their ownsatellite resulted in C-Band over-capacity, which is endemic across the region, and which must now be addressed through consolidation. C-Band is largely used in heavy rain areas. Ku-Band which also suffers from over-capacity, isbeginning to address this problem. Capacity is currently around 60 per cent for Ku-Band, but with good government and donor support and with collaboration with other countries it could go up to 75 per cent. There is a global average of 60 satellite deployments a year, and recently, North America has seen a surge in satellite usage, partly as aresult of homeland security issues. As figure 2 shows, the Asia-Pacific region is third in overall satellite deployments, and third in revenues for manufacturers as well (figure 3). Throughout all regions, leasing revenuesare also increasing, on average by 4.4 per cent per year. Satellite service demand in Asia-Pacific Every country in Asia-Pacific has its own domestic satellite broad- casting service. Therefore, a broadcasting and video service is what is mostrequired in the region. Even though almost all content broadcasted on satellite is in English, there is still a need for some local content.

Percentage breakdown of total satellite units by region, 2002-2007Bridging the digital divide - the satellite solution 13demand is also driven by high definition television (HDTV) and broadcast- ing which requires such large bandwidth only satellite can deliver. Broadband services can also provide Internet Trunking Services (ITS) and direct Internet Access Services (IAS) such as enterprise network services, and remote area direct access. It is the utilization of satellite for these Internet access services, which is expected to become the fastestgrowing section of the satellite market in the coming five to six years. Asia-Pacific broadband satellite markets Satellite revenue in Asia-Pacific still continues to come largely from the business sector. China and South Asia dominate the revenue streams in this area, and the industry growth is expected from there. The key to bridging the digital gap is to enable access to the Internet for remote and under-served areas. Through the application of satellite technology, this can be achieved. For community e-centres (CeCs), sustaina-bility is important. With government support and subsidies, this is possible. Satellite services that can be appliced to CeCs include: Intranet/LAN/WAN connectivity - this allows connectivity be- tween enterprise sites, with either one-way or two-way services Enterprise Video distribution - such as business TV , videocasting,Web Conferencing. For this application, training of local staff isimportant.

These needs can be addressedby properly engineered bidirectional satellite links that involve multipletransmitting earth stations. The Very Small Aperture Terminals (VSATs) used by fuelling stations and discount department store chains in the Americas, Europe and parts of Asia demonstrate that such networks arepractical (easy to install and centrally manage), reliable (99.9 per centavailability) and cost effective (saving users as much as 20 per cent overwhat an equivalent terrestrial network would cost). The architecture of atypical VSAT network employing a star topology (i.e. all communications through a central hub) is illustrated in figure 4. VSATs are becoming attractive to smaller enterprises and for big organizations that wish to push the use of satellite communication down further in their operation. The cost of equipment per site has dropped from over US$ 10,000 in 1998 to around US$ 2,000 in 2002. Consumer versionsthat provide high-speed access to the Internet are offered in the UnitedStates for under US$ 500. Figure 4 illustrates the technical concept of how VSAT works. VSAT is able to be shared across countries, and can uplink from anywhere.Hopefully, VSAT will promote collaboration, and will enable an educationnetwork, which will be helpful for developing countries in Asia, as it willallow the information to be gathered and shared, providing a very richresource of information available across the region.

A high- speed, switched, broadband capability allows users to originate and receive high quality voice, data, graphics, and video telecommunications using various technologies on a single converged network. Satellite broadbandmeans connectivity anywhere and at anytime. A broadband data communications service is one that requires a transfer rate greater than that afforded by a dial-up telephone line using a V.92 modem. This places the minimum data transfer rate at about 100 kbps, which is typical of current high-speed access services from a DigitalSubscriber Line (DSL) in its many forms, cable modems, and comparable fixed wireless and satellite high-speed access services. There is also the question of whether the two directions of transmission are of equal speed(i.e. symmetrical) or asymmetrical, such that the inbound speed from server to user is greater than the outbound speed from user to server. From an IT perspective, broadband services support standard office applications includ-ing e-mail and file transfer, and major software systems such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and distance education. Organizations are structur- ing many of their IT applications for use within a standard Web browser,allowing employees and partners to access services within the Intranet and from the external Internet as well. This makes applications seem relatively similar to the network, but the detailed structure cannot be ascertained ingeneral. High-speed access can provide video distribution, telephony and video conferencing, although these may not be deliverable through a browser since they require specialized user terminal devices or other appliances. Figure 5 shows the current challenges. Namely, without access to information, it is difficult to develop good education or infrastructure, and it is difficult to reduce poverty. Yet, without affordable communicationsinfrastructure, access to information is extremely difficult. The key challenge is to increase access to information in order to reduce poverty.

The role of government in increasing access to information is crucial. E-government can play an important role. In e-government interac-tions, the government creates the e-government platform in partnership withcentral government ministries, legislative and judicial authorities and localgovernment and administration (figure 6).

This solution allows subscribers toreceive multiple channels, even on small terminals, by bundling servicestogether. VSAT technology can provide this. VSAT demand is market and technology-driven. Fortunately, innova- tion of satellite broadband technologies means they are getting better and cheaper. Satellites also do not have many of the limitations of terrestrial networks and other wireless networks. For example, PSTN/ISDN/xDSL/ cable modems have bandwidth limitations, limited reach and are difficult to extend. On the other hand, VSAT enables globalization of businesses, with companies able to establish corporate intranets worldwide. VSAT also provides delivery of value-added services, such as broadband Internet access, multimedia entertainment and distance learning. Satellite is also more able to respond to the convergence of voice and data, which has been largely consumer-driven, and which became widely possible through mobile phones. Consumers want even more access, resulting more and more bandwidth. Broadband applications and services Broadband Internet access provides high-speed Internet for Web browsing, e-mail, news, downloads, video online, as well as distance learning solutions such as e-learning solutions based on satellite broadcast, which enable greater interactivity. Together with cost-effective terminal equipment, e-learning solutions provide a rich and colourful educational resource. It is also useful for distance medicine solutions such as tele- diagnostics, remote consultations, remote training and certification. Recommendation of satellite solution Currently, there is a great deal of unused satellite capacity in Asia that could be used for CeCs and other development projects if satellite companies could be found that were prepared to donate their spare capac- ity. In-kind donations of equipment are also needed, in addition to finding a flag carrier who could provide system integration and management. Lastly, assurance of government support is needed. C. Connecting people in rural communities through ICT: the Grameen telecom experience Mr. Rezwan Alauddin, Grameen Telecom Bangladesh: telecom scenario In Bangladesh at present there are around one million landlines operated by the state-owned Bangladesh Telephone and Telegraph Board(BTTB). There are four mobile phone operators with a subscription base inexcess of 3.25 million mobile phones. Mobile phones now out-number thenumber of landlines by 3.25:1. Eighty per cent of the population live invillages never used a phone previously.Connecting people in rural communities through ICT: the Grameen telecom experience 18Rural communication through innovation Grameen Telecom (GTC), through its Village Phone programme, has brought the latest communication technologies to rural villages, helping toconnect them to the rest of the world. GTC has made mobile telephonyservices available to over 35,000 of Bangladesh's 68,000 villages. Previ-ously detached communities are now connected to the rest of the countryand the world. Urban mobile phones have been made accessible to the rural poor, with mobile public call offices managed by \"Village Phone Operators\", generating income and employment in Bangladesh's villages. Village Phones Village Phones (VP) works as an owner-operated pay phone. It allows the rural poor who cannot afford to become regular subscribers, tomake use of the service with loans from Grameen Bank. The project aims to bring the full potential of the information technology revolution to villagers and the poor. The village phone is owner operated, with village phone operators being the main entrepreneurs. Most often, the operator takes a loan from GTC to purchase the phone. Theproject is focused primarily on bringing telecommunications services to thepoor. From this project, it can be seen that telephones can play animportant role in reducing poverty. Telephones have become an instrument against poverty by connecting rural areas to the rest of the world and bringing new opportunities to the rural populations. The project is a collaboration between four business entities - Grameen Bank, Grameen Phone, Grameen Telecom and the village phone operators (VPO). The aim of the project is to have a telephone in everyvillage in the country. Grameen Bank Grameen Bank (GB) is a pioneering micro credit organization. It provides small loans to bank members to enable them to earn a living through self employment. It is a pioneer in this area, by taking risks andbelieving that poor people are bankable. Grameen Bank now has 3.7 million borrowers under 1,267 branches, and provides financial services in 46,000 villages, covering more than 68per cent of all villages in Bangladesh. Customer repayment rates are veryhigh, with 98 per cent of disbursed loans repaid. Grameen Phone Grameen Phone (GP) is the largest mobile phone company in Bangladesh with 2.2 million subscribers and 75 per cent coverage. GP hasthe widest GSM network coverage in Bangladesh, covering 61 out of 64districts. Coverage in rural areas was extended after consultations withGrameen Telecom, taking into account areas which have high telephony demand. Coverage is increasing every day.Connecting people in rural communities through ICT: the Grameen telecom experience 19GP offers subsidized call rates for VPO's which are around 50 per cent lower than normal subscribers. Grameen Telecom Grameen Telecom (GTC) is a not-for-profit rural telecommunication company. Its mandate is to bring ICT services closer to the rural popula-tion. It is responsible for marketing, distribution and administration ofvillage phones through 18 unit offices. GTC unit officers visit the GrameenBank branches in areas where network coverage is satisfactory to provide VP service and prepare a list of villages. Village phone operators Grameen Bank (GB) chooses village phone operators (VPO) from among bank borrowers who reside in those villages and have good repay- ment records. Village phone operators are the most important component inthe programme. They, most often female, are Grameen Bank members.They purchase a phone under the lease-financing programme of the Bankand provide telephone service to people in their village. Each VPO is responsible for providing services to customers for both incoming and outgoing calls, collecting call charges, remitting pay-ments to Grameen Telecom, and ensuring proper maintenance of the telephone set. The operator's income consists of the difference between the charges paid by customers and the airtime charges billed to the operator byGrameen Telecom. Repayment of the loan for the phone set is processedthrough the existing loan granting and collection procedures of theGrameen Bank. Grameen Bank managers at the community level collectmonthly payments from operators, in person, at the village level. Village phone - operation The village phone operation is a tripartite, coordinated service which brings communication technologies to rural areas. GB selects potentialvillage phone operators and provides financial assistance for purchasing thehandset and connection. It also collects bills on behalf of GTC. GP provides network support and subsidised call tariffs GTC provides handsets, manages distribution and billing, and oversees bill collection GP avoids costs of billing and bill collection from rural villag- ers, but has a steady stream of revenue from the VP service The phones are distributed through 18 unit offices in each GB zone. In terms of billing, GP provides raw bill data while GTC processesindividual bills adding both GB and GTC service charges and value addedtax. GTC provides a dedicated VP call centre that provides information tovillage phone operators on bill status, call charges and connection status. For after sales service, GTC has 18 mobile phone service centres that provide the necessary maintenance and technical support to villageConnecting people in rural communities through ICT: the Grameen telecom experience 20phone operators in rural locations. Without these service centres, rural people would have to go to larger towns to get their phones fixed. Through VP connection and tariffs the project provides a steady stream of revenue for GTC. Village phone connection and handset costs are Takas 8,000 (US$ 135), and the fixed line rent is Takas 40 per month. Callcharges per minute are Takas 2.24 at peak hours (US$ 3.7) and Takas 1.24 at off peak hours for local and nationwide calls. VP operators charge around Takas 4 to Takas 6 per customer, depending on the availability of phones in the locality. The average monthly VP bill is Takas 5,200 (US$ 87.5). The average net income of aVP operator is Tk. 4,000 (US$ 68) per month. VP operators account for 3.85 per cent of all GP subscribers, but VP revenues account for 15.5 per cent of all GP airtime time revenues. VP subscriber growth Since 1997, VP subscriptions have grown tremendously, and they have now penetrated into the most rural, remote parts of Bangladesh. It is expected that subscriptions will reach 100,000 by the end of 2004. Social impact of village phones The phones provide village operators with a regular and good earning, averaging US$ 68 per month. This enables many operators to improve their economic circumstances, and often results in a change intheir social status. It also creates new business opportunities for villagers, leading to economic and community empowerment, and increased knowledge andconfidence amongst villagers. A study by the TeleCommons Development Group (TDG) of Canada for the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) concluded, \"The Village Phone Programme yields significant positive social and eco- nomic impacts, including a relatively large consumer surplus and immeasur-able quality of life benefits\". A further indication of the programme's success is its successful replication in Uganda, where there are currently 1,000 village phone operators. Pioneering rural ICT services The VP programme contains many rural development \"firsts\". It is the first rural development micro-credit facility in a developing country to target the creation of micro-enterprises based on information and communicationtechnology (ICT) services. It is the first rural development micro-credit facility in a developing country to assist in the creation of village telephone service businesses using digital, wireless telephony. It is the first private sector ruraltelecom initiative that specifically targets poor village women for establishing micro-enterprise (targeted, micro-level programme), and it is the first private sector telecom initiative with the explicit goal of rural poverty reduction.Connecting people in rural communities through ICT: the Grameen telecom experience 21However, despite its success, it would have been reckless for a GSM company to solely focus on rural Bangladesh because of the small marketand minimal purchasing power. But by combining the skills and expertiseof GB, GP and GTC, it has been possible to profitably serve the telecom-munications needs of the underserved rural poor. D. Social capital and the network effect: implications of China's e-learning and rural ICT initiatives Mr. Alexander G. Flor, Dean and Professor, Faculty of Information and Communication Studies, University of the Philippines Open University Introduction It has been often said that Information and Communication for Development (ICT4D) often neglects the \"C\" in its acronym, and that it is generally focused on information technology: hardware, software, networks or infrastructure. The C - communication - along with other Cs such as content and capacity building, is often a secondary consideration. The difficulty perhaps lies in the fact that the phrase ICT4D has combined two concepts that belong to different levels of complexity.Information is a product that falls under a level different from that ofcommunication, which is a process. Hence, there are problems in putting anoperational handle to the phrase. This is one reason why, in spite of itsmuch vaunted social promise, many are still unconvinced that ICT can bring about large scale societal and national development gains of the sort that will help to reduce poverty. People fail to appreciate the process dimension inherent within the term. However, although information and communication belong to differentconceptual levels, we should recognize the historical, theoretical and opera-tional affinities between information technology science and communicationscience. During the early years of information technology and communica-tion science, one was indistinguishable from the other. The two were considered as one discipline exploring how the mind and signals work, with scientists - Claude Shannon, Warren Weaver, Paul Ashby, Norbert Weinerand Allan Turing to name a few - doing the groundwork. In the course oftime, however, the mathematical-engineering dimension of this grand inquiryeventually split from the socio-communicational, with both branches devel-oping on their own. The former became known as information technology (IT) while the latter was called communication science. Yet, the information and communication sciences share the same roots and may well at somepoint in the future merge back into one inclusive discipline. It was along this line that the University of the Philippines estab- lished a Faculty of Information and Communication Studies in its OpenUniversity. This College puts equal emphasis on the \"I\" and the \"C\" inSocial capital and the network effect: implications of China' s e-learning and rural ICT initiatives 22ICT, offering graduate programmes on computer science and information systems alongside development communication programmes. It specializeson ICT4D with a research focus on social capital formation, critical masstheory, networking and knowledge management. How the aforementioned concepts are related to ICT4D, particularly the first three - social capital formation, critical mass theory, and networking - is the subject of this presentation. It makes use of the example of China, acentralized programmatic ICT4D model as operationalized in the Central Agricultural Broadcasting and Television School, as its empirical referent. The conceptual level Social capital In recent years, economists and sociologists alike have been closely studying a factor which has been deemed as a necessary element in thedevelopment equation. This factor is called \"social capital\", as distin- guished from financial capital, resource capital and intellectual capital. Social capital has been defined as the capacity of groups to work together for the common good (Montgomery, 1998) 2 or as the ability to draw on relationships with others, especially on the basis of trust andreciprocity (Human Development Report, 1998) 3. The sociological defini- tion of social capital is trust, reciprocity and mutuality that are inherent in social relationships (Cox, 1996)4. Robinson and Hanson (1995)5 forwarded an economic definition that describes social capital as the institutionaldimension of transactions, markets and contracts. To the above definitions, another can be added, which may be considered as communicational in nature. Simply put, social capital is theeconomic value obtained in institutional or individual networking. Note thatreciprocity and mutuality, two concepts contained in the sociological defini-tion, are variables central to networks and network analysis. However,social capital must be measured in economic terms. The network effect Perhaps the most popular IT adage is found in Moore's Law, which states that, technology wise, computing power doubles every eighteenmonths. A lesser known IT principle is the Network Effect, otherwise known 2Montgomery, John D. (1998). Social Capital - Research Notes , (Cambridge, Pacific Basin Research Center, John F. Kennedy Center, Harvard University). 3United Nations Development Programme (1998). Human Development Report , (New York, United Nations Development Programme). 4Cox, Eva (1995).

Hanson (1995). \"Social Capital and Economic Cooperation\", Journal of Agricultural and Applied Economics , 27(1), pp. 43-58.Social capital and the network effect: China's e-learning and rural ICT initiatives 23as Metcalf's Law, after the head of the Ethernet development team. The Network Effect states that the total value of a network where each node canreach every other node grows with the square of the number of nodes. This may be illustrated in the following hypothetical scenario: Consider that an NGO has five stand alone Pentium IV personal computersworth US$ 1,000 each. The total hardware resources would amount to US$5,000. The Management Information System (MIS) administrator then in-stalls a local area network (LAN). Once the LAN is installed, the potentialvalue of the system increases exponentially. Let: NV = potential network value of the system V = unit value of hardware resourcesn = number of nodes NV = nV 2 = 5 (US$1,000)2 = US$ 5,0002 NV = US$ 25 M For a system whose hardware resources total US$ 5,000, the potential value reaches up to US$ 25 million when it is networked and connected to the Internet. This exponential increase in value is most likely due to thesynergy produced by the interconnectivity of the nodes. Further, the potential value reflects the access to computing resources in the Internet. Reed's Law David Reed, a sociologist and community development expert, ap- plied Metcalf's Law to social networks and arrived at a similar conclusion. Social capital may increase exponentially through Intranet and Internet connectivity, but why does social capital increase in a networked environ- ment? The following reasons are given: Superimposing electronic networks on social networks allows individuals to cross easily between these networks Electronic networks provide \"doors\" between online communityinfrastructures Access to the world wide web increases the potential social capitalof a community through the augmentation of its knowledge capital For instance, if a NGO has a team of five project officers, individu- ally generating community development assistance projects worth US$ 10,000 each, their total project portfolio would amount to US$ 50,000. When linked as a workgroup via LAN, their potential social capital may increase exponentially, given Reed's Law. Let: NV = potential network value or social capital V = average unit contribution to social capital n = number of nodes in a social networkSocial capital and the network effect: implications of China' s e-learning and rural ICT initiatives 24NV = nV2 = 5 (US$ 10,000)2 = US$ 50,0002 NV = US$ 2.5 B In this particular example, the basis for computing the average unit contribution to social capital by each node was based on the average unitproject portfolio. Due to: (a) the synergy produced in working together as a group; (b) the use of a common platform; and (c) the knowledge resources in the World Wide Web available to them individually and as a group, thepotential social capital of the non-governmental organization may reach as much as US$ 2.5 billion. Critical mass theory In physics, critical mass is the amount of radioactive material necessary to produce nuclear fission. Since the eighties, social scientistshave been applying this term to refer to the number of early adopters necessary to steer the rest of the population into collective action. The Critical Mass Theory developed by Oliver, Marwell and Teixeira (1985) attempts to answer the following questions: What are the preconditions for sustained collective action? When does a development intervention assume a life of its own? The theory was tested through empirical research on, among others, early adopters of rice production technology. In 1987, Markus applied Critical Mass Theory to interactive media. In general, the research found that sustained collective action is achieved when a core of members (10 to 15 percent) within a group or community engages in mutually reinforcing reciprocal behaviour. When such conditions within a critical mass are achieved, then one is assured of a practice spreading throughout the population. An example of this phenomenon is the spread of texting or the use of the SMS functionality in cellular phones in the Philippines. When a core of 10 to 15 per cent of cellular phone users began reinforcing one another's utilization through the exchange of SMS messages, the rest of the populationmigrated to GSM, making it more popular than telephone calls or voice mail. Can we apply Critical Mass Theory on ICT4D, in general, not only when focusing on cellular telephony? Can a critical mass of rural develop- ment users eventually trigger large-scale utilization of ICT in the country-side? Will such large-scale utilization bring about dramatic increases in social capital among rural development user-communities as predicted by Reed's Law? What would be the implications of this to traditional develop-ment sectors such as agriculture, natural resources management, and others? Answers to these questions may be found in China's e-learning and rural ICT initiatives.Social capital and the network effect: implications of China's e-learning and rural ICT initiatives 25The empirical level - China China is the world's largest nation and fastest growing economy. It is Asia's most powerful country with a population of 1.25 billion. However,rural dwellers account for 78 per cent of its population. Agriculture is the main source of livelihood in the rural areas, with the sector accounting for a substantive portion of China's GNP. Chineseagriculture is diverse and technology driven. Yet, it has reached less than half of its potential because of poor education. Rural ICT initiatives Due to centralized planning, China has adopted a radial approach in developing its rural ICT infrastructure. In collaboration with the telecom-munications and education ministries, the Ministry of Agriculture has taken the lead in establishing community e-centres (CeCs) all over China, albeit employing an approach that differs from that of other countries in fourrespects. Firstly, China is simultaneously developing both satellite and fibre optics technology for its rural ICT infrastructure. It currently operates arobust satellite service that has being actively participated by commercialservice providers. Recently, however, it has entered into an agreement withthe Government of Israel for the provision of 500 Very Small Aperture Terminals (VSAT) for its rural satellite broadcasts and Internet access. Hand-in-hand, the development of the fibre optics backbone is well on itsway to completion. The last mile links, however, are concurrently beingaddressed primarily through CeCs. Secondly, CeCs belong to a centralized multi-tiered network at the national, provincial, prefecture, township and village levels. In other coun-tries, CeCs usually start as independent community initiatives and are thusnot networked institutionally. Thirdly, the Ministry of Agriculture is building CeCs upon existing networks of agricultural service providers such as agricultural bureaus,agricultural information centres, local governments and other distance educa- tion institutions. For the past three decades, the Ministry has been establishing an expanded network of farmers' libraries. These libraries are gradually beingretooled and transformed into CeCs thus ensuring density and penetration. Fourthly, CeCs, particularly those under the Ministry of Agriculture, are the basis of the distance-learning network - the Central AgriculturalBroadcasting and Television School (CABTS). Central Agricultural Broadcasting and Television School The Central Agricultural Broadcasting and Television School (CABTS) was established in 1980 with a mandate to provide education andSocial capital and the network effect: implications of China' s e-learning and rural ICT initiatives 26training to enhance agricultural production. Its target audiences are farmers, rural youth, rural women, leaders of rural communities and agriculturalextension workers. CABTS, which has been called the \"cradle of competentfarmers,\" is now the world's largest educational establishment for agricultureand rural development, catering to an average of 900,000 enrolees per year. The CABTS network is enormous. A central school in Beijing administers the network which includes: 38 provincial schools; 330 prefec- ture schools; 2408 county schools; 23,000 township training centres; 60 virtual classrooms, which will soon increase to 560 with Israel's donation of VSAT units; 2,750 administrators; and 45,107 staff members. Since it was established in 1980, CABTS has been employing traditional print, radio and TV-based distance learning delivery. In 2001, however, it began migrating to online teaching and digital learning environ- ments, employing broadband and wireless technologies. It will make full use of the non-commercial Internet backbone and will eventually establish 2000 virtual classrooms all over China. Considering the size of its network and its thousands of nodes, not to mention its centrality and network integrity, CABTS has assumed a very formidable position to tap the social and economic potentials of interconnectivity as described in Metcalf's Law, Reed's Law and Critical Mass Theory. It can serve very well as a model for social capital formation and learner mobilization through distance instruction. In fact, it may be said that the ideal conditions exist for social capital and critical mass formation. To begin with, China has had a long history of collective action. Further, it has strong centralized social structures. More importantly, the norms supporting these structures, such as respect for authority and adher- ence to the common good, are imbedded in society. Further, CABTS was a thriving institutional network even before it developed its online learning network. Reeds Law illustrates that social networks need to be in place before electronic networks can generate the required synergies for social capital. Hence, the migration to online learn- ing was initiated with the proper sequence. In addition, CABTS deals with appropriate subject matter or content. Agriculture and rural development is still a major sector in China, espe- cially considering FAO's observation that only half of the country's agricul- tural potential is being tapped due to the lack of education. Lastly, China has the numbers to reach critical mass. CABTS's 900,000 students per year will expand with the availability of digital online learning technologies. When the number reaches the critical ten to fifteen per cent threshold, then agricultural productivity may double. Further, once this critical mass is reached, then the impact will be felt not only in China but in the rest of Asia as well.Social capital and the network effect: implications of China's e-learning and rural ICT initiatives 27If Reed is right, then: Social capital among farmers' groups in China will increase exponentially A critical mass of farmer-learners will be formed to spearhead productivity not only in China but for the rest of Asia China's agricultural productivity will increase dramatically Social capital formation will become a legitimate preoccupationfor non-formal e-learning programmes E. Digital inclusion: public and private partnerships Mr. Akhtar A. Badshah, Senior Director, Community Affairs, Microsoft Corporation It is widely recognized that technology is a potent force that can empower people to reach their goals and realize their dreams - but for many people around the world, the digital divide keeps that power out of reach. Despite real improvements in access to, and use of, information andcommunication technology (ICT) around the world, there is a wealth of evidence to suggest that the digital divide between and within countries is growing. Today, millions of the world's citizens lack the access and, more importantly, the skills they need to participate in the new information basedglobal economy to realize their full potential. Microsoft hopes to improve those statistics - one person at a time by broadening digital inclusion through a variety of programmes and products developed in tandem withgovernment leaders, educators and development professionals. Over the years, the company, along with others in the industry, has supported community based programmes to provide access to computers. By partnering with International Youth Foundation, Boys and Girls Clubs of America, Partnerships Affirming Community Transformation (PACT), NPower (a national network in the U.S.A. that is putting technology know-how in the hands of non-profit organizations) and others, Microsoft has sought to create innovative solutions to provide access to technology, diversify the IT workforce and strengthen non-profit organizations through technology. Access to technology, however, is only part of the answer. It is equally critical to provide IT skills training, tools and guidance to help people discover what technology can do for them, and what they can do with technology. To address this set of needs, Microsoft created Partners in Learning for K-12 schools around the world and the Unlimited Potential (UP) programme. Unlimited Potential is improving life-long learning for underserved youth and adults by providing technology related skills through community technology and learning centres (CTLCs) or telecentres. Publicly accessible gathering places, whether in the form of libraries, meeting rooms, schools,Digital inclusion: public and private partnerships 28or community centres, represent prime locations where people can go beyond merely having access to technology and can acquire the skills to use it effectively to help themselves and their communities. Through this global programme, technology training will be used to create social and economic opportunities that can change lives, transform communities, and strengthen local economies. The Unlimited Potential programme consists of four components: a grants programme focused on supporting IT skills training and improving thecapacity of CTLCs; a software donations programme; a curriculum that can beused or adapted by CTLCs; and a community technology support network. Unlimited potential grants The Unlimited Potential Grants are available for organizations manag- ing programmes aimed at increasing the technology skills of underserved persons. Project grants will be provided both in countries where Microsoftsubsidiaries are located and where there is no country-level Microsoft presence.The grants are evaluated by Microsoft staff in that country or region and areissued twice a year with deadlines for project proposals in March and October. Since May 2003, cash grants and software totaling nearly US$ 80 million have been provided to more than 260 programmes in 87 countries.Funding has been focused on providing support for IT skills trainingprogrammes and typically used for helping an existing CTLC to strengthenits training programmes by allowing it to hire more trainers, expand course offerings or reach larger numbers of underserved community members. Software donations An expanded software donation programme is to be created for CTLCs so that they have access to the most current applications necessary for community learners to compete in the global economy. Unlimited potential community learning curriculum Together with Microsoft's support of CTLCs, the Unlimited Potential Community Learning Curriculum is a resource that supports community learning and enables individuals to acquire the necessary workforce skills to use technology effectively to help themselves and their communities. Thecurriculum provides quality content for the community (non matriculating)learner that focuses on skill development in the areas of: Introduction to information technology and computer literacy Information and communications technologies Workforce development and preliminary technical certificationpreparation The training emphasis is on real-world applications and the course material is available in multiple languages and may be modified and/orreproduced by the community learning centre, the instructor/facilitator, and/ or the student to enhance the local learning experience.Digital inclusion: public and private partnerships 29Community technology support network To support CTLCs, Microsoft is working with the International Development and Research Center (IDRC) in the creation of technology support networks by offering services for CTLCs such as providing off-line and online resources, tools and workshops that will enable greater collabo- ration and make CTLCs more sustainable. The network will help to aggregate best practices, curriculum, research, tools, solutions, and access to local support services used by community e-centres around the world. F. E-learning project planning for community e-centres Mr. Kyosuke Yoshimura, Learning Solution Executive, IBM Asia Pacific Policy and role of community e-centres Community e-centres (CeCs) support local government functions in forming communities of interest to address key issues across governmentand the private sector. E-learning is the common service to implement through each e-community project. E-community projects need to have appropriate IT professionals and engage in training. They need to identify their target audience and beneficia- ries and need to know how many people they wish to connect to the CeC. Communities of interest can include: Community enhancement: transportation, parks and recreation, education, police, healthcare Economic development: commerce, revenue (tax incentives),education/skill enhancement programmes, infrastructure (power, electric, water) Social protection: welfare, health, education Personal Security: police, immigration and intelligence agencies Developing human resources is a challenge faced by both central and local governments. CeC projects need to have IT professionals who are able to implement the system and need to train officials and citizens to usethe system. E-learning \"Learners\" at a CeC include citizens, workers, students, community decision makers, organizational leaders and rural development professionals. They may want to learn about anything from housing, nutrition, and transportation to healthcare, education (teaching and learning), communica-tions or employment, business and the economy. E-learning is growing rapidly. One of its most important features is that it can provide real-time content, anywhere and anytime, as it is computer-based and interactive. The modes of delivery include CD-ROMs,E-learning project planning for community e-centres 30the Web, satellite and TV . It is fundamentally different from classroom training and should not be considered as a replacement of classroom learning. Through e-learning, more sharing and collaboration is possible. Advantages of technology-based training and education E-learning is moving from skills management to competency man- agement to knowledge management. E-learning can improve learning per- formance and reduce the amount of time needed to learn and acquire knowledge. One of the problems faced by many developing countries in the region is the limited number of good teachers. Through e-learning, a wider audience can be reached and enables teachers to manage more students. E-learning is able to reach a broader segment of population, thereby bringing in mobile and non-traditional students. It promotes class participa- tion and makes academic credits easily transferable. Its curriculum is more flexible and responsive to student's needs and able to continually expand the range of courses that include an online component. Those wishing to introduce e-learning should observe the world's most advanced e-learning institutions and work with government to develop a strategy to leverage technology to implement existing educational goals. It is also important to consult with business to ensure that end-users are properly prepared. Both teachers and students gain from e-learning. Education (teaching and learning) methods are changing, and learners' active participation is becoming more important for the training result. E-training assists e- learning implementation by providing access to the technology used by e- learning. Therefore e-learning helps to implement e-community by using learning technology. E-learning technology develops training content in several ways. The four-tiered e-learning approach is effective for both education and training.E-learning uses Tier 1 and 2 mainly and government officials and citizens learn from information and interaction. Tier 1: Performance support and reference e-materials - learningfrom information Tier 2: Interactive learning, simulations and games - learning from interaction Tier 3: Collaborative learning - learning from collaboration Tier 4: Experience-based learning - learning for co-location CeCs can develop capacity of local community and government by providing users with information and knowledge (e.g. information on agriculture, natural resources), as well as enchaning skills in business management, economics, accounting, trading through vocational trainingand education support. CeCs users include local economy leaders, IT professionals, student and citizens.E-learning project planning for community e-centres 31IT skills training can also accelerate industrial development and employment by assisting users to reach an adequate level of IT competency (quality and quantity), acquire the skills required for e-community initia-tives, expedience to create or enhance performance of new industries andproficiency in the English language. IT literacy has a seven skills category/model defined as European IT driver licence: 1. Basic IT concepts 2. Using the computer and managing files 3. Word processing4. Spreadsheet5. Database6. Presentation7. Information and communication E-training allows users to develop flexibility in their usage of the technology. A well-developed training strategy is a key to successfulimplementation. Therefore, e-training should be discussed as the commoninfrastructure for any e-learning project. For instance, the Venezuela Ministry of Science and Technology (MCT) established and developed a software workforce to improve its globalcompetitiveness and encourage productivity through the use of e-businessapplications. Their training partner's experiences in the software industry, e-business technology and IT training services provided a complete solution forthe government's objectives. The MCT was able to initiate the trainingelement of the software industry development plan quickly and cost- effectively and thereby address their employment, economic and technology issues sooner. High-level professionals from the first class of graduates enterthe market after only one year of training. Further, both training costs perstudent and student dropout rates are lower than the industry standard. Another example is the Japan Institute of Worker's Evolution (JIWE), which provides a job-finding Web site for citizens, and alsosupports skills assessment and e-learning. The mission of JIWE was tosupport citizen re-employment, and to provide classroom seminars andinformation materials to help citizens find jobs. Its challenge was to find a way to provide support services to women who could not visit the training centre because of their responsibilities to care for other family members athome, for example, child care or aged family care. It wanted, therefore, toprovide employment information and e-learning services that could beaccessed anytime and at anywhere, to a wide range of people and help\"Mothers back to work\" - the slogan. Its solution was to use a prototype approach to capture the clients' contents/system requirements, so that it could shorten the development cycle. JIWE provided e-learning curriculumdesign consultation and e-learning contents development and provided an e-learning 24-hour hosting service system called \"Hurray Hurray Net\".E-learning project planning for community e-centres 32This system had e-learning standard compliance as well as a flexible and rich courseware selection. The on-demand hosting system servicesmade it possible to implement the system quickly, and reduce maintenancecosts and provide 24-hour operation. User-friendly web-based e-trainingcontent encouraged users who were not familiar with PC operations to use the service. Users could join in the virtual community from home and exchange their experiences with others. A third example, Mitaka City in Tokyo, is an example of a success- ful e-community application that is also providing an education servicethrough its Web portal. In January 2001, the Mitaka City Board of Education and IBM Japan jointly started a pilot project that effectively utilizes information andcommunication technology such as broadband networks to link four el-ementary schools in Mitaka, aiming at realizing a new school educationsystem based on social participation by schools, guardians and communitymembers. After the achievements of this project, the \"School, Guardian and Community Member Collaboration Education Project of Mitaka City\" ex- panded to encompass all 15 municipal elementary schools in Mitaka. As a result, teachers spend less time on non-specialized areas, and can concentrate on their classes and communication with students. Also,students can get real knowledge and receive joint learning, increasing thecreativity of each individual and improving skills in communication as wellas problem-solving. What makes this project possible is that Mitaka City is connected by broadband, enabling quick, widespread access to the Internet. Along with the educational component of the City's web portal, the portal also providescommunity communication functions such as bulletin boards, school and community information, as well as mentoring services by connecting students, parents, teachers and student counsellors. It also provides e-meeting services,video delivery, home page and e-mail addresses and a secure intranet. ICT infrastructure for CeC Before establishing, a CeC needs to be both the ICT tools and infrastructure. A high-performance backbone network is fundamental to the provision of the CeC. The infrastructure should provide: (1) A local network for the transmission of video, data and telephony; (2) high speed,secure connectivity to the Internet; (3) high speed, secure access to a WAN for connectivity to external nodes; (4) connectivity to wireless access points to provide anywhere/anytime connectivity for users; (5) connectivity to anyexisting e-community and university networks; and (6) the wired LAN facilities to connect the high performance backbone to the individual access points for the training classrooms, the media centre, the breakout roomsand the auditorium.

South-east Asian needs assessment for a global open agriculture and food university Mr. Alexander G. Flor, Dean and Professor, Faculty of Information and Communication Studies, University of the Philippines Open University A needs assessment for postgraduate education on agriculture and natural resources in South-east Asia was conducted with the followingobjectives: to assess the postgraduate agricultural education needs of keyagricultural players in South-east Asia; to identify curricular offerings ofthe Global Open Agriculture and Food University (GO-AFU) in the subre- gion; and to determine institutional mechanisms for GO-AFU operations. It adopted a three-pronged design employing the Delphi Technique; keyinformant interviews; and documents analysis. The findings of the needs assessment study included the following issues: demand for post graduate education in agriculture; competition fromlocal education providers; practicality of the distance mode for agriculturalsciences and research based degrees; and accreditation. In South-east Asia,English as the medium of instruction did not seem to be an issue provided that instruction was done at the postgraduate level. The study found that there are four major open universities offering eight degree programmes dealing with agriculture and related sciences. Further, all ASEAN countries have higher education institutions that offer postgraduate degrees in agriculture, natural resources or related fields.

Prospective enrolees would beexpected to come from both research and extension services of the Ministries of Agriculture and from agricultural universities around the region. The study recommends that CGIAR push through with its plans to establish a Global Open Agriculture and Food University; target prospective enrolees coming from both research and extension services of the Minis- tries of Agriculture and from agricultural universities, as well as agricul- tural researchers and extension workers from the private sector; offer programmes on extension, research and specialized programmes on informa- tion management, knowledge management, bioinformatics and geographic information systems; offer a series of short-courses on practical aspects of food security; seek international and national accreditation; and adopt a network structure with a global centre, regional and national nodes. Background The Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research is establishing a CGIAR Global Open Agriculture and Food University (GO- AFU) for the purpose of sharing the agricultural knowledge generated by CG institutions with agriculture professionals and other key agricultural players in the developing world through open learning and distance educa- tion. The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) has taken the lead in establishing the GO-AFU, employing a network approach. Three regional hubs for the CGIAR GO-AFU - one each in Africa, South Asia and South-east Asia - have been identified for this purpose. In South-east Asia, the University of the Philippines Open University (UPOU) is being considered to serve as the regional focal point. One of the initial activities for implementation is to conduct educa- tional, training needs assessment of key agricultural players representing the following sectors: national agricultural research systems (NARS) and gov- ernment extension workers at the local government; field staff from non- governmental organizations and civil society; and farmers, rural women and out-of-school youth. IFPRI has commissioned the UPOU to undertake the South-east Asian needs assessment study. This presentation discusses the results of the study. Objectives The objectives of the study were to: 1. Assess the post-graduate agricultural education needs of key agricultural players in the South-east Asian region 2. Identify initial curricular offerings of the GO-AFU in South-east Asia 3. Determine institutional mechanisms for GO-AFU operations in South-east AsiaSouth-east Asian needs assessment for a global open agriculture and food university 35Methodology Previous studies conducted in Africa and South Asia essentially included three elements: (a) an Internet discussion forum; (b) key informantinterviews and focus group discussions for ground truthing; and (c) the assessment of secondary data. Because of time constraints, the South-east Asian study slightly modified the procedures for investigation and adopteda three-pronged design employing the Delphi Technique; key informantinterviews; and documents analysis. Results and discussion Post graduate education needs among South-east Asian agricultural professionals Based on key informant interviews, documents analysis, the Internet search and the e-mail Delphi, the need for post-graduate agriculturaleducation in South-east Asia may be described as ambivalent at best and contradictory at worst. The key interviewees and the Delphi responses, in particular, gave conflicting answers, deviated from the guide questions, anddwelt lengthily on the following issues: Demand for post-graduate education in agriculture Competition from local education providers Practicality of the distance mode for agricultural sciences andresearch-based degrees Accreditation Although it was mentioned occasionally, English as the medium of instruction was not regarded as a significant issue provided that the programmes were at the postgraduate level. In general, however, the findings tended to be encouraging for the GO-AFU. Environmental scanning A Global Development Learning Network (GDLN) is currently being planned in Cambodia with key sponsors from Canada and other bilateral sources. This global learning network may cover post-baccalaureate offer- ings in agriculture. In terms of ongoing programmes, an Internet search revealed that there are four major open universities offering agriculture programmes in the sub-region: Universitas Terbuka in Indonesia; the University Open University in Thailand; andthe Ramkhamhaeng Open University, also in Thailand. Collectively thesefour universities offer eight degree programmes dealing with agriculture and related sciences. However, most of these programmes are at the baccalaureate and pre-baccalaureate diploma levels. Only two programmes are at the post-graduate level - the Master of Agricultural Extension programme offered bySukhothai and the Diploma in Agriculture offered by the University of theSouth-east Asian needs assessment for a global open agriculture and food university 36Philippines. The latter is the only programme offered in English; however, it is being phased out due to the lack of enrolees. Practical areas of specialization in the asistance mode The Delphi study identified extension training, specifically participa- tory extension, as the most relevant content for postgraduate agriculturaleducation, particularly in Cambodia and Lao People's Democratic Republic.But this should be agricultural extension in the non-traditional, non-linearsense. To quote from a member of the panel: \"...Lao People' s Democratic Republic agriculture profession- als understand the needs of farmers but they don't necessarily have the skills or ability to identify and develop programmeswhich are based on these needs and which help farmers solvetheir problems. In addition, there is a huge need for analyti-cal thinking and problem-solving skills that will help the LaoPeople' s Democratic Republic professionals better meet the needs of farmers...\" For Viet Nam, postgraduate programmes should address both re- search and extension specializations. The key informant interviews tended to agree with these recommen- dations not only for Viet Nam but for Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand as well, though not for Myanmar, where the need was felt for postgraduateagricultural extension education. The key informant from the Philippines believes that professionals will be interested in enrolling in GO-AFU programmes if they specialize inhigher-order knowledge and skills such as information management, knowl-edge management, bioinformatics and geographic information systems. Thenumerous state universities and colleges of agriculture in the Philippines rarely offer degree programmes in these areas. Further, these can be easily taught via the distance mode unlike research-based programmes such as plantbreeding, agronomy and animal science. This begs the question - Should the GO-AFU focus on postgraduate education or continuing education? Postgraduate education versus continuing education Agriculture is often regarded as a practical area of study and this has been reflected in the findings. Some of the respondents, particularlythose in the Delphi panel, felt that postgraduate education may not beaddressing the majority of the practitioners' needs. Master's and Ph.D.programmes would only serve the requirements of the minority, consisting of researchers and agricultural scientists based in universities and the national agricultural research systems (NARS), thus defeating one of theprimary purposes of distance education and open learning - providingaccess to the majority who cannot be accommodated in residentialprogrammes due to resource limitations. Hence, there were many reserva-tions regarding postgraduate education within this panel. Some felt that, ifSouth-east Asian needs assessment for a global open agriculture and food university 37indeed, a master's degree should be offered, then it should focus on extension and not on agricultural science. A Ph.D. programme on agricul- ture science that is offered via the distance mode would be all the moresuperfluous. Instead, a few suggested a series of short courses on practicalaspects of agriculture that would cater to the dominant requirements offood security, food safety, post harvest handling and marketing. Alternatively, there is always room for a more creative approach. In the second Delphi round, one expert volunteered the following regarding the practicality of GO-AFU programmes: \"... High level manpower training has to be continuous. Since there is a presumption that the mode of delivery is by distance education or through e-courses, we have to be creative in how this can be done considering the constraints... However, this programme need not be for the masses or for a large number of students. We have to target the 'elites', those with high intelligence, who are highly motivated, and have access to certain resources and interest in graduate education. Start with a few leaders, others will follow.\" Whether leaders or followers, do agricultural professionals require a postgraduate degree? Reference was made earlier to the UPOU Diploma in Agriculture. It was initially designed in 1980 as an 11-month programme that would cater to staff members of the Department of Agriculture of the Philippines. The programme was previously offered at the residential mode by the University of the Philippines Los Ba\u00f1os College of Agriculture but eventually figured among the first programme offerings of the UP Open University. Although the programme enjoyed substantial patronage during the initial years, even including graduating students from other countries, enrolment eventually fizzled out during the 2001-2002 school year. A related development was the professionalization of agricultural practice. In the Philippines, Bachelor of Science in Agriculture graduates are now required to take board examinations to practice their profession. It is the only country in South-east Asia that has done so. On the other hand, an increasing number of agricultural professionals in South-east Asia are employees of government, private organizations and agribusiness concerns. These professionals require formal degrees and not non-formal short courses, for their professional advancement. This opinion has been echoed by most of the key informants who felt that there will be a large demand for these programmes, particularly in Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand and Viet Nam. Summary and conclusions The findings of the needs assessment study focused on the following issues: Demand for postgraduate education in agriculture Competition from local education providersSouth-east Asian needs assessment for a global open agriculture and food university 38Practicality of the distance mode for agricultural sciences and research-based degrees Medium of instruction Accreditation In South-east Asia, English as the medium of instruction did not seem to be an issue provided that instruction is done at the postgraduate level. 1. There are four major open universities offering eight degree programmes dealing with agriculture and related sciences. Mostof these programmes are at the baccalaureate and pre-baccalau-reate diploma levels. Only two programmes are at the postgradu-ate level, one of which is being phased out due to a lack ofinterest. However, geography has little bearing on Web-baseddistance learning. Professionals from South-east Asia may nowavail themselves of postgraduate agricultural education fromNorth American, European, South African and South Asianinstitutions through e-learning. Further, all ASEAN countrieshave higher education institutions that offer postgraduate degreesin agriculture, natural resources or related fields. 2. Key informants believe that there will be interest in Master and Doctoral programmes offered via distance mode by the GO-AFUprovided the degrees are internationally and nationally accred-ited. Singapore and Brunei will have no demand for GO-AFUprogrammes. However, countries in the Mekong area will have asubstantive demand for postgraduate programmes in agriculturethat will be offered via the distance mode. 3. Prospective enrolees will come from both research and extension services of the Ministries of Agriculture and from agriculturaluniversities. 4. With some reservations, key informants from regional and inter- national organizations expressed interest in the CGIAR GO-AFUinitiative and would welcome being involved in the planningand implementation phases. 5. The Delphi study identified extension training, specifically par- ticipatory extension, as the most relevant content for postgradu-ate agricultural education, but this should be agricultural exten-sion in the non-traditional, non-linear sense. Postgraduateprogrammes should address both research and extension special-izations. Professionals will likewise be interested to enroll inGO-AFU programmes if they specialize in higher-order knowl-edge and skills such as information management, knowledgemanagement, bioinformatics and geographic information systems. 6. Some of the respondents felt that postgraduate education may not be addressing the needs of the majority of the practitioners.Master's and Ph.D. programmes would serve the requirements ofthe minority, consisting of researchers and agricultural scientistsbased in universities and the NARS, thus defeating one of theprimary purposes of distance education and open learning.South-east Asian needs assessment for a global open agriculture and food university 397. A series of short courses on practical aspects of agriculture that would cater to the dominant requirements of food security, food safety, post harvest handling and marketing was suggested bysome. 8. A consensus was reached among the key informants that GO- AFU programmes should seek both international and nationalaccreditation. 9. Key informants endorsed the network approach that the GO- AFU will adopt, for example, possessing a global centre withregional nodes in Africa, South Asia and South-east Asia withsome variations in specific countries. Recommendations The study offered the following recommendations: 1. CGIAR should push through with its plans to establish a Global Open Agriculture and Food University offering postgraduateprogrammes in agriculture, natural resources and related sci-ences. 2. These programmes should target prospective enrolees from both research and extension services of the ministries of agriculture and from agricultural universities, as well as agricultural re- searchers and extension workers from the private sector. 3. In South-east Asia, primary sources of enrolees are Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Myanmar and Viet Nam.Secondary sources of enrolees are Indonesia and Thailand. Ter- tiary sources are Malaysia and Philippines. 4. The postgraduate programmes should focus on extension and research, in that order of importance. Specialized programmeson higher-order knowledge and skills such as information man-agement, knowledge management, bioinformatics and geographicinformation systems should likewise be considered. 5. A series of short courses on the practical aspects of agriculture that would cater to the dominant requirements of food security,food safety, post harvest handling and marketing should also beoffered. 6. GO-AFU programmes should seek both international and na- tional accreditation. 7. GO-AFU should adopt a network structure with a global centre and regional nodes. It should involve other regional and interna-tional organizations in the planning and implementation. Further,it should also consider working within the ASEAN frameworkof mutual cooperation in South-east Asia, and it should offerprogrammes jointly with national open universities.South-east Asian needs assessment for a global open agriculture and food university 40H. Developing a business plan for community e-centres: operations and management Mr. S. Senthilkumaran, Associate Director, Informatics Division M. S. Swaminathan Research Foundation, India Despite outstanding achievements in the areas of ICT and high technology, two state governments belonging to two different parties in thegeneral election of India early this year have failed to return to power,largely because the rural poor felt that the benefits of these technologiesdid not reach them. Community e-centres (CeCs) may be one way toimprove the life of the rural community and ensure that the benefits of technology are reaching all, including those in rural areas, who need them. Poverty is not only an absence of money. Often communities who have lived for generations in poverty develop a sense of utter hopelessnessand lose their sense of self-respect and dignity. They become increasinglymarginalized and excluded. They lose their voice. What can ICT do to helpthe poor? The last few years have seen many initiatives that deploy ICTs in rural communities in many developing countries, but are they working? Alfonso Gumucio Dagron, development communication specialist with the Rockfeller Foundation, has written: \"Only one out of every one hundred telecentres are really useful for the local community where they have been set-up,in terms of supporting development and social change. This may shock many of those that see ICTs as the ultimate magic solution for poverty, but I challenge anyone to show me thatI'm wrong. Thousands of telecentres have been planted duringthe past five years and millions of dollars have been investedin buying computers and ensuring Internet connectivity; how-ever, every time we are to mention the successful experiences, the same five or six places come to mind. In other words: something smells very bad in cyberland.\" A few successful examples according to Dagron are the Village Knowledge Centres established by the Swaminathan Research Foundationin Chennai, India. Dagron believes this project is a good example of CeCthat really care about providing appropriate information to their constitu- ency. The concept is articulated around community needs, not the opposite. \"Information shops\" have been placed in various villages, and a \"valueaddition centre\" is in charge of building web pages with information that isrelevant to local needs, such as market prices or local weather reports. Thecore concept is to build a \"local web\" that specifically caters to the needsof local communities, in terms of contents, culture and language. Mr. Dagron says, \"There are too many examples of projects that are only bombarding the Third World with computers, in the most irresponsiblemanner and for the benefit only of hardware and software companies. On theDeveloping a business plan for community e-centres: operations and management 41other hand, there are very few, I insist, very few experiences of use of new information and communication technologies that are paradigmatic in the way they contribute to development... this is why the Village Knowledge Centresin Pondicherry are such an important and coherent experience.\" The Swaminathan Research Foundation business, operation and management plan for community e-centres Before setting up CeCs, the Foundation conducted a large-scale consultation with the local communities. Participatory rural appraisal (PRA) was used as a method to identify the information needs of the community. Information on district and village profiles, household details, economic activity of the village, maps, information needs, existing infrastructure such as government institutions, primary health centre, education institution, was collected. As was information on how many people are living below the poverty line. Information was also collected on weak and strong linkages between the information disseminators and rural community, profiles of underprivi- leged communities, market information, details of artisans and small mer- chants, problems of landless labourers and local interaction patterns. This helped to create a micro-plan for the village. The PRA was also used to assess how far the community was willing to go in operationalizing the local centre, by way of making in-kind or cash contributions. This was also used in the identification of a group of individuals who would be consensually chosen by the community for managing the local centre. Field experience indicated that three factors are very important in initiating village knowledge centres, the first of which is community ownership; the community as a whole must endorse the centre. Second, it must be useful; usefulness is more important than the use of latest technology. Lastly, it should not be associated with one group or caste. Community participation is vital in all rural, community-based ICT projects. Having the right community champions is critical to ensuring project success. Community participation should be broad-based and representative, regardless of social and economic status and local community participation should start from the conceptualization stage and be sustained throughout. The community will need to play a major role in determining the key resources, such as the project champion, and the right local institution to partner with. Multi-stakeholder partnerships can be useful for communi- ties, but care needs to be taken in selecting the partners to engage with. New technologies, especially wireless, are increasingly important because they are easier to deploy and may cost less than conventional technologies. What already exists often determines and can limit future options. For that reason, telephony is still very relevant for rural access. Adequate technical skills are required for ensuring/maintaining a robust connectivity infrastructure. Internet technologies offer new options to pro- vide cheaper and more flexible services (e.g. V oIP).Developing a business plan for community e-centres: operations and management 42Constraints must be removed on the basis of a malady-remedy analysis. For example, wired and wireless technologies could be used where telephone connections are not adequate or satisfactory. Similarly, solar power can be harnessed where the regular supply of power is irregular. The approach should be based on the principle that there is a solution for every problem. Connectivity must be able to address the content requirement to be adequate. Economics of scale matters - connectivity is very expensive but can be cheaper if shared. However, emerging technologies (such as VSAT and direct TV) are changing many of these assumptions. Rural communities are typically not attractive for profit-oriented telecommunications companies, and are a result the last mile solution must be self-financed in many cases. Therefore, it is important to assess the various available technology options for the last mile and the first mile (wireless, satellite, V oIP, fibre, etc.), and implement those that are cost-effective and reliable. Building a resource for the technical know-how will be useful. Creation and updating of relevant content to suit local needs is a key factor in the e-community programme. The information provided should be demand-driven and should be relevant to the day-to-day life and work of rural women and men. Also, semi-literate women should be accorded priority for trainings to operate the centre, since this is an effective method of enhancing the self-esteem and social prestige of women living in poverty. Another important technique is the packaging of appropriate con-tent (e.g. in local languages) for specific community needs and choices. Content should be delivered in both conventional and electronic means (use not only web sites, but also community newspapers or radio). Knowledge dissemination should be linked to access to the inputs needed to apply the knowledge for economic activities. It is important to be strategic in generating or procuring content in view of the potentially high cost involved. Equally important as understanding the content is to take the appropriate action based on the information provided (figure 8). E-Community Center Connectivity Content Satisfied Clients\u00a4\u00a4 \u00a4\u00a4 Figure 8. Connectivity and content in a community e-centreDeveloping a business plan for community e-centres: operations and management 43Using the hub and spokes model, CeCs have both connectivity and content. This model is designed to empower rural families with newknowledge and skills and should be designed on the antyodaya (unto the last) model, where the empowerment starts with the poorest and most underprivileged women and men. In this model, the local population has asense of ownership of the CeC. It is client managed and controlled, andinformation provided is demand- and user-driven. The local populationshould be willing to make contributions towards the expenses of the CeC,so that the long-term economic sustainability of the programme is ensured. Contributions in cash or in-kind generate a sense of ownership and pride and create an economic stake in the operation of the centre (figure 9). Figure 9. The hub and spoke modelHub Of next importance is management. Involving youth in the manage- ment and decision-making aspect of CeCs is very important. Managers should be familiar with the technology, willing to learn, and have aninterest in the needs of the community. The management processes shouldbe flexible, collective and where necessary hierarchical with individualaccountability. The community's role in management should typically beadvisory; functional management by the community is not necessary. It is important to find a strong leader with good communication skills who enjoys the confidence of the community. How to convert the CeC into a business model CeCs can create long-term, self-sustaining solutions which reflect local needs, but they require local entrepreneurship, which in turn, can fuel the creation of additional local business community enterprises. The CeCs need to be made available in larger numbers and information exchangemust be available at lower costs if recent ICT advances are to have asignificant impact on development for the world's poorest people.Developing a business plan for community e-centres: operations and management 44The business of CeCs can be increased through several value-added services, for example by providing access to telephone, fax, voice mail, e-mail, SMS and the web. This will increase demand for further IT trainingand access to computers and applications and information about distancelearning programmes and information (weather, government services, news,entertainment), electronic libraries and publications, databases on appropri-ate technologies as well as connectivity and web space for local institutions(schools, health units, local government, NGOs, SMEs, farmers' and pro-ducers' associations). CeCs can also provide administrative, accountancy and bookkeeping services; resources for offices, such as business development, marketing andtechnical support; telehealth, telemedicine and continued education to as well as e-banking, micro-finance and e-commercefacilities; tools and resources for community organization and participationin decision-making; digital recording of multimedia products for localbusiness and culture promotion - examples might include pictures of arts,crafts, tourist accommodation; and local business facilities. Other servicesinclude providing ICT tools (portable computers, wireless telephones, andaudio equipments) for rental, and providing facilities such as printers,photocopying, scanners, digital cameras, conference rooms, library and TV/VCR equipment; and locally relevant services such as birth and deathregistration, land registry, primary produce processing information anddetailed market prices. People in poorer communities could gain through increased knowl- edge of everything from food prices to new business ideas. By providingsuch services, CeCs could also become more financially self-sustaining bytaking a percentage of payments made for non-free information, such ashoroscopes or business courses. In every programme, harnessing the power of partnerships is very important. It is only through partnerships that the gap between \"scientificknow-how\" and \"field-level do-how\" can be bridged. Therefore, for CeCprogrammes to succeed they need to ensure they bring in partners fromsectors relevant to their users, for example in agriculture, education,weather, health and business. I. The Rice Knowledge Bank: what is it and can e-communities benefit? Mr. M.A. Bell, Mr. D. Shires and Mr. A.P . Barclay, International Rice Research Institute Farmers regularly identify access to credit, good prices and knowl- edge as major limitations to improving their livelihoods. Although infor-mation and communication technology (ICT) is recognized as holdinggreat promise to help meet information and knowledge needs, there haveThe Rice Knowledge Bank: what is it and can e-communities benefit? 45been few examples of success. To capture the promise of ICT, the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) developed the Rice KnowledgeBank (RKB) 6 - the world's leading ICT repository of rice-based training and technology information. Since its launch in September 2002, it hasreceived over four million hits. This presentation outlines how the RKBis designed to deliver focused, credible, value-added and demand-driveninformation. The presentation also highlights the role of partnerships inensuring that the information available on the RKB reaches those who canbenefit from it. Highly focused, accurate information combined with a setof committed partners makes ICT successful - it is ICT structured forsuccess. Knowledge - a major need for farmers The major limitations farmers feel they face, almost universally - irrespective of the country they are in - are credit, price and access toknowledge. While recognizing the need to work with a range of players to address the credit and price gaps, IRRI saw a tremendous opportunity to have direct impact on addressing farmers' knowledge gap. In particular,IRRI saw the potential of harnessing the power and promise of ICT to address the knowledge access problem. Can ICT really help farmers? The major question for IRRI was, \"if we develop an ICT-based resource, will farmers really be able to access such knowledge and trulybenefit?\" While the statistics for personal computer access across most of Asia suggest that presently there is little hope, the future may be more promising. Farmers themselves may lack direct access, but IRRI targetsmany research and delivery partners, such as scientists and agricultural extension workers (who educate farmers to produce better crops at a lower cost), who do have access. ICT tools are, therefore, available to the peoplewho work with and train the farmers. Further, the proliferation and increas- ing use of Internet caf\u00e9s suggests that ICT does have potential as a tool to reach farmers directly. Unfortunately, potential alone is of little use. What is the reality? There is cause for optimism in recent informal studies that indicate that every single major NGO and government research and extension partner has in its offices personal computers with CD drives, and most offices haveat least some machines with Internet connectivity. ICT tools are available to the people who work with the farmers. 6Available at www.knowledgebank.irri.orgThe Rice Knowledge Bank: what is it and can e-communities benefit? 46IRRI's response to knowledge needs and the potential of ICT - the Rice Knowledge Bank Seeing the potential and promise of ICT, IRRI developed the Rice Knowledge Bank (RKB), which contains a wealth of information for ricerelated training and extension, and is the world's first digital extension service. The RKB has received critical acclaim as a tool to distil, store and provide access to the vast array of IRRI's training and support knowledgefor rice science and extension (for example, BBC Earth Report, September 2004 7; the Further Readings about the RKB section, below, provides more reviews). This success was not accidental: IRRI devised a clear strategy forthe development of the RKB. IRRI staff recognized that creating a digital repository was only a start. There were plenty of other projects that also had large \"shovel-ware\" repositories - sites where anything and everythingrelated to an area were placed. IRRI saw that, in developing countries, major issues needed to be addressed if the RKB were to serve its ultimate purpose of helping rice farmers improve their rice-based livelihoods whileprotecting the environment. In particular, if the RKB was to be used effectively by farmers and their intermediaries, it was critical that its content be focused, credible, demand-driven and value-added. Focused A great temptation when using the immense power of ICT is to include as much information as possible - the principle that, \"if a little isgood, then more is better.\" Given more than 40 years of science and research, IRRI was well equipped to pursue this strategy. However, the RKB developers recognized early the importance of ensuring that the siteremain focused, containing only knowledge that is relevant to extension and research training and support. This way, the target audience can quickly identify knowledge that is directly relevant to it without having to searchthrough large amounts of irrelevant information. Another aspect of focus relates to the target audience - the rice farmers of Asia are unlikely to gain regular, reliable access to ICT in the immediate- or medium-term future. The RKB was, therefore, designed totarget the farmer intermediaries - research and development workers who already have access to ICT and need access to information to help farmers. Targeting these people is especially effective because many are alreadyeducated and experienced in training farmers. 7Further readings about the RKB: \"Organized free for all\": Rice Today 2(1); \"The Rice Knowledge Bank: strengthening capacity\": 27(2);\"Rice Knowledge Bank: \"How rice farmers benefit from ICT\": www.new-agri.co.uk/04-4/focuson/focuson3.html; \"Rice could get a bounty crop, thanks to the Net\": www.expresscomputeronline.com/20030106/indcomp2.shtmlThe Rice Knowledge Bank: what is it and can e-communities benefit? 47Credible A search of the Internet using the keyword \"rice\" results in some 12.8 million \"hits\" - but which of these can you believe? To address this problem, IRRI ensures that the RKB content is credible and accurate. To achieve this, IRRI instituted and maintains a rigorous quality-control pro- cess, which involves sign-off on content by the relevant IRRI scientists and review by RKB staff. With these mechanisms in place, combined with IRRI's 40 years of proven research results, users can be confident about the quality and relevance of the knowledge in the RKB. Value added The RKB is value-added because it is available in a range of forms suitable to the needs and circumstances of the target users. All the knowledge is assembled and then made available either online, on CD-ROM or in print. The RKB's structure makes it a single-source publishing resource. It was felt strongly from the beginning that RKB content should not just be a series of computer files online. Rather, the RKB presents information in forms that make the knowledge more accessible and more directly usable. Examples of this include: Decision support tools (TropRice and Rice Doctor ), which are computer programmes that lead users easily through a process to solve their particular problem and find possible solutions Fact sheets that present the distilled essence of topics in one or two pages, these \"how to\" sheets allow practitioners to actually implement practices Reference guides on field-related information that are concise and easy-to-read, the RKB does not include the original scientific papers but rather draws on best practices in the private sector to present information in an easy-to-use, fully indexed, book form E-learning courses that have been created to capture and present a selection of key training topics in a form that users can access when and where they want and at a time of their own choosing Demand driven The RKB team recognized that long-term success depended on access methods and content that is driven by user needs. This is ensured through IRRI's extensive in-country networks, which continually identifycountry needs and provide feedback on the relevance and ease of use of the RKB. In addition, the RKB site has extensive, up-to-date usage statistics - providing information on the most searched-for topics and keywords - that help refine analysis of needs. One particular demand-driven innovation is the development of country-specific sites. These sites, the links to which sit under national flag icons on the RKB homepage, contain the best and most relevant local knowledge provided by users in each country. Much of this information isin the local language.The Rice Knowledge Bank: what is it and can e-communities benefit? 48Utilised - the ultimate definition of success? The ultimate success of the RKB is defined by more than just the amount of access to the information. It is also dependent on how success- fully the knowledge is applied to farm practices. One heartening example highlights this process in action. Upon walking into one of the cramped Internet caf\u00e9s that dot the roadside in the impoverished rice-growing areas of north-eastern Thailand, Mr. Ragat Nag,Director General of the Mekong Department of the Asian Development Bank, noticed an enthusiastic group of youngsters taking delight in showing their parents how to use a computer. What intrigued Mr. Nag most waswhat the children were showing their parents. Choosing to ignore the latest computer games, they were viewing pages from Rice Doctor, a diagnostic programme developed by IRRI to help rice farmers manage rice pests anddiseases, and translating the relevant pages into Thai for their parents. Although encouraged by this type of story, IRRI knows that rice knowledge rarely flows this directly from IRRI, through the Internet, tofarmers. As a result, IRRI focuses its ICT and knowledge-dissemination efforts on the intermediaries - those staff members of national agricultural research and extension systems (NARES) and other partners such as NGOswho run extension services. These are the real target users of the RKB. In other words, IRRI trains trainers, who then adapt IRRI research methods and recommendations to local conditions and relay them to farmers. There is little doubt about the success of access to the RKB. The site has registered over five million hits since its inauguration in September 2002and the number of users continues to grow. At present, the RKB averages just over 1,000 visits per day at an average of 12.40 minutes per visit. This equates to almost 10,000 person-days of \"training\" per year delivered topeople where they want it, when they want it. Some argue that this form of training is even more effective than traditional face-to-face methods, as the participants get information on exactly what they want. The access statisticsdo not include internal IRRI traffic or use of the many thousands of RKB CDs already distributed. While the RKB team is happy with these numbers, it aims to turn access into application. Thus, the RKB project continues tolook for better ways to ensure application in both the classroom and the field. User feedback tells us that such application is happening, and it is in field application that we hope to see continued growth. Future of the RKB - application This presentation has so far established what the RKB is and that it is being widely accessed, but what of the second question in this presenta-tion - \"Can e-communities benefit?\" The authors feel that e-communities can and are accessing the RKB, but for real success the RKB must be more cohesively linked to field activities. The RKB team is encouragingeffective application by developing relevant content that grows along with in-country partnerships. The RKB will continue to develop: 1) targeted content with the addition of more locally-sourced and validated content,The Rice Knowledge Bank: what is it and can e-communities benefit? 49and 2) extension of RKB application and use in countries across the region by government organizations, NGOs, universities and training partners, particularly in linking access to field-oriented activities. All future development will continue to ensure that the RKB's focus remains strong, its content always targeted, up-to-date and accurate, and that effective in-country use of this content meets the demands of farmerintermediaries and farmers. Plans are in place to further improve content and to link the RKB to a participatory approach in field delivery, ensuring that knowledge not onlybecomes more widely available, but also more widely applied to help farmers.Success depends on changing old linear delivery modes to participatorymodels that bring together partners skilled in technology (the researchers),delivery (the extension experts) and relevance (inclusion of farmers as key partners). While such efforts are easy in concept, there is no doubt that ultimate success relies on the hard work of the many field workers who makescience a reality by turning ideas into practice and by supporting the oldsaying that \"seeing is believing\" or the old Chinese proverb: \"When I hear, Iforget; when I see, I remember; when I do, I understand.\" The RKB team will improve participation by:1. Working with selected partners who have ICT access and skills, and who are also committed to training and field delivery. IRRIwill help make the knowledge and skills gained through the RKBmore accessible to other in-country partners (extension workers, for example) at a time and place of their own choosing. 2. Expanding the quality and scope of the country-specific informa- tion by capturing the best local knowledge available, thus ensur-ing that RKB material remains demand-driven and easy to use. 3. Transferring to national systems the considerable knowledge of how to develop, maintain and use ICT-based knowledge banks in agriculture. This will help national systems develop their own rice knowledge banks with whatever information they decidemeets their farmers' needs. They will also be able to transferthis knowledge to the field and to other crops. IRRI will helpnational systems develop their own knowledge banks. The RKB Vision The vision that IRRI has for the RKB remains essentially unchanged since its conception - the RKB aims to provide necessary, accurate information in the most appropriate form for the target audience. The current vision states: \"IRRI' s Rice Knowledge Bank is the world's leading provider of rice-related training and technology information, used byfarmers and people who help them to improve the livelihoodsof rice-dependent communities\".The Rice Knowledge Bank: what is it and can e-communities benefit? 50J. Stakeholder partnerships for ICT in rural communities Mr. Sahdev Singh and Mr. Dilip Shinde, Asian Institute of Technology Introduction In recent years, the term \"multi-stakeholder partnership\" (MSP) has gained much currency in development circles. However, there are few documented examples of truly effective MSPs in the realm of Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICT4D). MSPs are about partnerships that are greater than the sum of their parts and about creating lasting and meaningful impact at all levels ofaction. They are meant to promote a more holistic approach to developmentand better governance. Principles governing the management of multi-stakeholder ICT4D partnerships for sustainable development include: 1. Know when to apply a multi-sector ICT partnership 2. Before agreeing to enter into partnership, weigh its merits against the alternatives and risks 3. The interests of all partners should be mutually reinforced 4. Successful partnerships are built on complementary competen- cies and resources that, in combination, meet the parameters ofsome strategic design 5. The resources and competencies contributed to the partnership should be drawn from as close as possible to the core business of the partner organizations 6. Consensus should be sought for a written document identifying: the shared vision of the partnership; the objectives of eachpartner; and the division of roles and responsibilities 7. When evaluating the outcomes of multi-stakeholder ICT partner- ships, care should be taken to identify the incremental contribu- tion of the partnership activities over and above external factors and the next most likely alternative Stakeholder perspectives Different types of organizations in society view multi-stakeholder partnerships in different ways. Business perspective From a business perspective, no single company can deliver on the myriad of expectations surrounding sustainable development articulated byall its stakeholders: staff, shareholders, customers, suppliers, regulators andlocal communities. The reputation of the business, its ability to manage non-commercial risks, its capabilities to meet both internal and external requirements for corporate social responsibility, and its ability to realizeopportunities for growth that benefits those socially excluded, will alldepend on a business model that fully exploits its core competencies, whilstStakeholder partnerships for ICT in rural communities 51concurrently partnering with other organizations who can bring the neces- sary complementarities to form more complete solutions. From this perspec-tive, multi-stakeholder partnerships for sustainable development are thus nodifferent in many of their principles from conventional business-to-businessstrategic alliances. Public sector perspective In the context of the dual forces of economic liberalization and the proliferation of (or demand for) democratic decision-making, both central government and municipal authorities find it increasingly challenging to achieve the right balance between their wide range of civic duties relating to sustainable development. Regulation of the free market is needed to ensure corporate responsibility, the promotion of foreign investment to stimulate employment opportunities, social inclusion, environmental protec- tion, the provision of affordable public services, and responsive governance. In this context, it is not surprising that there are increasing numbers of examples of government departments and agencies seeking partnering op- portunities with business and civil society organizations in order to enhance their capacity to administer the challenges of sustainable development. Civil society perspective The size and influence of this \"third sector\" has been increasing in the last two decades. Recent international studies of its economic contribu- tion have shown it to be significant and growing - particularly in devel- oped countries where a substantial proportion of social services are deliv- ered through civil society organizations (CSOs). Likewise, in developing countries, an increasing proportion of development aid is being delivered through CSOs. Civil society groups can either play an advocacy or cam- paigning role, or they can become part of the solution, drawing on their local knowledge, capacity for innovation and trust of the general public to contribute in partnership to sustainable solutions. Definitions of multi-stakeholder partnershipsThe Bali principles A set of principles for multi-stakeholder partnerships was drawn up in a preparatory conference in Bali, Indonesia 8 in 2002 as input to the World Summit on Sustainable Development. Designed for so-called \"Type II\" partnerships, the principles are as follows: 8\"Annex: Guiding Principles for Partnership for Sustainable Development ('type 2 outcomes') to be Elaborated by the Interested Parties in the Context of the WorldSummit on Sustainable Development (WSSD)\", in the Vice-Chairs' summary of theinformal meetings of the Fourth Summit Preparatory Committee (PREPCOM 4), Bali,Indonesia, 7 June 2002, <http://www.johannesburgsummit.org/html/documents/prepcom4docs/bali_documents/annex_partnership.pdf>Stakeholder partnerships for ICT in rural communities 52Partnerships should: Help achieve the further implementation of Agenda 21 and the Millennium Development Goals, consistent, where applicable, with sustainable development strategies and poverty reduction strategies Be voluntary and self-organizing Be based on mutual respect and shared responsibility of thepartners involved Have a multi-stakeholder approach, arranged among any combi- nation of partner Be international in their impact, beyond the national level Multi-stakeholder ICT partnerships - a definition One of the dangers of the current \"partnership\" movement is that the idea is fast becoming an 'end in itself', rather than a \"means to an end.\" The conclusions of the Digital Opportunities Initiative9 (DOI) suggest that since ICTs are in practice \"enablers\" of sustainable social and economic develop-ment, multi-stakeholder ICT partnerships (i.e. strategic compacts between different ICT players) are likewise enablers and not ends in themselves. The DOI concluded further that the complexity of meeting the challenge of ICTas an enabler of sustainable development requires a holistic approach. The first stage of any multi-stakeholder partnering process is therefore to identify the \"design parameters\" of the desired solution. Only then can one scansociety to find partners with the right suite of competencies, resources andincentives to collaborate in successful implementation. Drawing on these ideas, and the language of the DOI, a new definition for multi-stakeholder partnerships in the field of ICT sector is proposed: Multi-stakeholder ICT partnerships are alliances between par- ties drawn from government, business and civil society thatstrategically aggregate the resources and competencies of each to resolve the key challenges of ICT as an enabler of sustain- able development. The partnering process Multi-stakeholder ICT partnerships for sustainable development will invariably involve new forms of collaboration between non-traditional parties. Partners may, therefore, have quite different organizational cultures, ways oftaking decisions, perceptions of accountability, methods of working and modes of behaviour. A key principle of successful partnerships is their ability to satisfy the drivers and interests of all the partners. Effective partnerships haveto manage cultural differences, build trust and satisfy underlying interests. This requires effort to be placed not only on structural components of the partnership - the objectives and division of roles within a partnership - but also on thedesign of the process of multi-stakeholder partnering itself. Although the \"partnering process\" is likely to be different for different types of partnerships, there are some common steps (figure 10). These are discussed below. 9Digital Opportunity Initiative, Creating a Development Dynamic: Final Report of the Digital Opportunity Initiative, DOI Report 2001 <http://www.opt-init.org/framework.html>Stakeholder partnerships for ICT in rural communities 53Partnership exploration Drawing on the principal conclusion of the DOI, namely that ICTs are enablers of sustainable development rather than ends in themselves, the first task in developing a multi-stakeholder ICT partnership is to understand what the development goal is that the partnership is intended to deliver. In thefirst instance, this is most likely to be chosen by the organization that is selfelected to convene the initial discussions, and is usually developed as asimple and consistent \"theme.\" Over time this theme often transforms, byconsensus, into the overall vision or leading objectives of the partnership. A frequent error of any organization contemplating entering into a partnership arrangement is to launch into discussions with others beforefully understanding their own needs and interests. These include: The organizational drivers and interests to be served by thepartnership Which in-house activity, programme, management system ordepartment the partnering process and resulting partnership willintegrate with The organization's negotiating strategy during the early consulta-tion period The anticipated benefits of the partnership weighed against thecosts and risks Working through these steps will enable each prospective partner to judge the merits of entering into collaboration. However, once this assess-ment is complete it is still not certain that a partnership will develop.Before this can happen a degree of \"buy-in\" has to be generated withinsuitable partner organizations. A targeted process of consultation is the best way to secure this. The consultation should: Establish channels of communication with a range of potential partners and interested partiesBROKERING2.

Common steps in the partnering processStakeholder partnerships for ICT in rural communities 54Develop the strategic design parameters of the partnership dia- logue or solution that will deliver the agreed sustainable devel- opment goal, i.e. \"requirements modeling\" Identify those parties best positioned to bring the right resources and competencies to meet the design parameters, and assesstheir likely capacity to implement the future commitments Agree on a process by which the partners will consult/ negotiatethe terms of the partnership Partnership building A partnership will not progress unless all parties are able to reach consensus over how their underlying interests will be fulfilled and who willtake responsibility for what action. What should be avoided is any one partnerdictating the objectives and terms of the partnership. Building agreement overthe details of any collaborative arrangement requires all partners to adopt astyle of negotiation that accommodates differences in both culture andinterests, and still achieves consensus. Conventional \"adversarial\" styles ofnegotiation often lead to \"win-lose\" outcomes and are therefore, a poor basisfor developing mutually reinforcing partnerships. More likely to be effectiveis a consensual, \"win-win,\" style of negotiation, where mutual understandingand a \"celebration of difference\" are key features. Central to the effectiveness of multi-stakeholder ICT partnerships is the quality of resources and competencies committed by each party, and the degreeto which these match the required design parameters. In addition to the moreobvious resources and competencies, there are also those that are \"hidden\" andyet which might play a key part in the success of the partnership. Theseinclude staff secondments, local knowledge, office and other standardequipment, project management skills, administrative services, mediationskills, influence over and access to key individuals, willingness to adopt aleadership role, an ability to borrow capital at low interest rates, and a capacityto leverage resources from others. Once the vision and objectives of thepartnership are agreed upon, along with a work plan outlining the division ofroles and resources and other required structural components, the final task isto ensure that the partners have the capacity to implement their commitments. Partnership maintenance Whether in networking, dialogue, hardware or software types of partnership, as the partners begin to work together there are bound to betensions. Over time, the partners may need to convene to re-negotiatecertain aspects of their original set of agreements, including, for example,the range of resources committed, key roles of certain partners, and theaddition (or deletion) of new objectives or partners. Conventional organiza-tional management tools such as SWOT analysis and decision-trees haveproven to be useful at this juncture.Stakeholder partnerships for ICT in rural communities 55The need to adapt the configuration of multi-stakeholder ICT partner- ship over time is likely to derive from one or more of the following causes: Unanticipated behaviour of, or between, the different partners Design parameters that lack the strategic complexity to deliverthe intended sustainable development outcome Insufficient capacity of a partner organization to implement itsresource commitments or roles Changes in the external business or political environment Completion of agreed \"milestones\" in the work plan (e.g. theend of the design or construction phase, or the planned reviewof a \"pilot\" or beta site) In addition to occasional re-negotiations, the partners need to be in regular communication with each other, to prevent differences from escalat-ing into disputes, and to solve problems jointly and creatively. The more thepartners interact, the more likely it is that the partnership will be successful. Multi-stakeholder ICT partnerships in international developmentThe Global Knowledge Partnership and ICT4D The Global Knowledge Partnership (GKP), founded in 1997, is a worldwide network committed to harnessing the potential of ICTs forsustainable and equitable development. Within the GKP framework, govern-ments, civil society groups, donor agencies, private sector companies andinter-governmental organizations come together as equals to apply ICTs fordevelopment (ICT4D). GKP recognizes that \"access to information and knowledge is essential if the disadvantaged, the marginalized, and the poor are to improve their lives and lives of their children.\" In the context ofinternational development, the GKP views multi-stakeholder ICT partner-ships as the combined efforts of the public and private sectors and civilsociety stakeholders to: Better inform policy and decision-making on development Encourage shared commitment to common development goals Increase the impact and extend the reach of ICT development initiatives Leverage human and financial resources Maximize the outcomes of applying ICT At the second GKP conference in March 2000, delegates highlighted the importance of multi-stakeholder ICT4D partnerships, recommendingthat, \"the GKP promote the creation of multi-stakeholder partnerships toincrease access to ICTs.\" 10 In response to this, in January 2003, GKP led a 10Global Knowledge Partnership (2002). \"Report of the Global Knowledge Forum Pro- ceedings\", proceedings of the second Global Knowledge Conference (GKII) (KualaLumpur, 2000), p.51 <http://www.globalknowledge.org.my/gkf_report.pdf>.Stakeholder partnerships for ICT in rural communities 56workshop on the theme, \"ICT at the service of development - multi- stakeholder initiatives and lessons learned\". As part of the challenge to\"create\" multi-stakeholder ICT4D partnerships, the GKP has agreed toorganize the ICT4D Platform of the World Summit on the InformationSociety (WSIS). The Platform will showcase a number of multi-sector ICT4D partnerships and, it is hoped, begin the task of developing a strategy for formulating pioneer partnerships integrated with the dual-summit format of the WSIS process. The persistent challenges of ICT4D ICT can make a significant contribution to poverty reduction and development in the developing world. ICTs can improve the effectiveness of disaster relief, for example, through speeding procurement of the more urgent types of humanitarian assistance; enhance the efficiency of health services, in the form of improved record keeping, more accurate diagnosis and information exchange on prevention; and provide access to educational services, for example through distance learning. ICTs are also a means of improving the responsiveness of government to local priorities, disseminat- ing information and opportunities for rural producers and poor urban dwellers to tap into new markets or find employment, and for engaging civil society and business in the reform of public sector institutions. Beyond these more obvious applications, there is growing interest in the value of ICT in international development for two further reasons. The range of communication types available should mean that different tech- nologies can be strategically selected to offer the closest fit with the needs of poor communities. For example, communities within microwave radio reach of fibre optic cable links can make use of a range of Wireless Local Loop (WLL) technologies such as the corDECT system. For those more distant from the countries' infrastructure backbones, or in hilly terrain, Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) satellites are now available and actively promoted by some international development agencies. Connectivity based on VHF or UHF wireless technology is another, narrowband, option. The second is concern over the low level penetration of ICT in the poorer regions of the world. Some interpret this as a future opportunity for business, namely that the mass of rural populations offers an as yet untapped market. Others view the lack of ICT penetration less as a business opportunity and more as a moral imperative for poverty reduction. Either way, as Chapman and Slaymaker 11 argue, \"The contradiction between the potential for ICTs to address the challenges faced by rural and urban development, and the current failure to harness them for this purpose, is striking.\" 11Chapman, Robert and Tom Slaymaker (2002). \"ICTs and Rural Development: Review of the Literature, Current Interventions and Opportunities for Action\", Working Paper 192,London, Overseas Development Institute, <http://www.odi.org.uk/publications/working_papers/wp192.pdf>.Stakeholder partnerships for ICT in rural communities 57The challenges to achieving greater ICT access for poor communi- ties and the subsequent utilization of this access to reduce poverty are many. They include the ineffectiveness of the regulatory regime to attractnew investment; the design of ICT transactions with the private sector that fail to deliver affordable ICT solutions; unprofitable business models for rural ICT access; ICT strategies that fail to exploit the diversity oftechnologies; and content that is irrelevant to the poor communities. K. A survey of rural kiosks in India Ms. Karishma Kiri, Director, Rural Computing Initiatives, Microsoft Corporation Introduction By some estimates, there are as many as 150 rural PC-kiosk projects across India, many of which already have, or are planning, thousands of instalments. Most of these projects were started within the last five years,riding on India's booming IT industry. Reflecting the nation's diversity, these initiatives differ in goals, models, operating paradigms, and geo- graphic distribution. Every sector is involved - large enterprise, entrepre-neurs, universities, government, and NGOs - with motives ranging from turning a commercial profit, to driving socio-economic growth, to stream- lining government bureaucracy. Rural kiosks could provide the first computing experience for as many as 700 million people in India. The sheer number of such people isdifficult to ignore. Indeed, the recent Indian election results are an indica- tion of this segment's frustration and provide a loud reminder of its collective influence. In this political climate, rural technology initiativeswill become even more important. Although the average member of this demographic group lives on less than a dollar a day, even conservative estimates today suggest that rural India has an aggregate discretionary income of US$ 2 billion per year. Yet, they struggle to obtain basics such as drinking water, food, shelter,electricity, and proper healthcare. Despite this, they will often spend what little they have to purchase goods and services beyond these necessities that promise a better life. One of the questions raised in this presentation iswhether computing technology can play a key role in the socio-economic development of rural areas. Early evidence indicates that rural kiosks help impoverished villagers improve their standard of living by expanding livelihood options and empowering them with information, tools, goods, and services (such as education and healthcare). The true challenge is in finding ways to deliverthis benefit broadly and consistently, while making kiosk projects economi- cally sustainable in the long term. As would be expected when the world's most advanced technologies are dropped in the middle of pre-industrialfarming communities, great innovation is required at the interface, both technically and in terms of sustainable business models.A survey of rural kiosks in India 58Points of entry Participants in the rural kiosk space enter with different agendas. One way to segment kiosk projects is by looking at who and why - who started the project and for what purpose. Along these lines, we can broadlysplit kiosk projects into commercial initiatives run by large enterprises, community-oriented entrepreneurial projects, and government-led initiatives. Commercial initiatives Large enterprises see immediate or future opportunities in rural markets. Naturally, increasing the corporate bottom line is a primary driver. Kiosk projects may also raise a corporation's public profile, as they tend togenerate positive press, especially if the projects demonstrate lasting value to the constituent villagers. One prominent example of a commercial initiative is ITC's e-Choupal, which supplies market information throughvillage kiosks to entice farmers to sell directly to ITC. Similarly, EID-Parry in Tamil Nadu supplies sugarcane farmers with agricultural information. Other examples include ICICI's rural banking and micro-loan services andHindustan Lever Limited's e-Shakti online store for rural markets. Backed by large corporations, these projects tend to be independent, self-reliant, and interested in extending their core businesses. Although,they are not driven primarily by a desire to spread computing technology to villages, many observers believe that these projects will endure in the long- term, because their business case is soundly established. Entrepreneurial initiatives Many kiosk projects are run by community entrepreneurs, often in close partnership with NGOs and non-profit foundations. Although it may seemstrange to lump entrepreneurs and NGOs in one category, they are actually driven by similar goals with respect to kiosks: The entrepreneurs are eager to service their communities' needs while making a profit, and the NGOs areintent on having social impact that is economically sustainable and scalable over time. Drishtee, for example, was spun off from an IT service company to better serve its goal of \"connecting India village-by-village.\" n-Logue,incubated by a group including university faculty and entrepreneurs, has a similar vision. TARAhaat is a start-up initiated by a non-profit organization that aims to help develop rural communities via Internet-based services. Most of these projects are experimenting with different services and expansion plans. One unique characteristic of this group is that they see technology as a key component of their mission. They want to see the connected PC playing a key role in empowering villages. Thus, creativeuses of the kiosk PC are encouraged, beyond any one specific application. Government initiatives National and state governments have increasingly focused on intro- ducing IT to rural areas. They are driven by a desire to build IT capacityamongst their citizens, to stimulate economic growth in villages, and to streamline bureaucratic processes. Examples include Kerala's AkshayaA survey of rural kiosks in India 59project, which seeks to make 100 per cent of the State's households computer literate, and Bhoomi, in Karnataka state that enable citizen to access land records online and through kiosks. The Government supplies much of the seed investment for these projects, and in many cases also subsidizes operating costs. Computerizedgovernment services seem likely to endure, especially where they replaceolder bureaucratic processes or are tied to fundamental government-to-citizen (G2C) needs, such as land records or education. Usage scenarios and benefits In industrialized nations, the connected PC offers convenient access to information and services that are already available offline. Inunderserved communities, this benefit is more pronounced and goes farbeyond mere convenience. In many cases, a kiosk brings to the villager information that once was practically unavailable, and services that took days of costly travel are now within biking distance. One study showedthat each kiosk typically saves a village US$ 15,000 annually in costs oftrips into town and lost wages. 12 So, the value of a connected PC in a village can be immense. Enumerated below are some of the more common usage scenarios. Al- though any given kiosk is unlikely to provide all of these services, noneare able to survive without offering at least a few: E-government: National and state governments are both eager to computerize their bureaucracies where possible, and entrepre-neurs, such as Drishtee, have entered the market to aid the Government in making services widely available. Applications range from filling out forms, applying for licenses and birthcertificates, filing petitions and grievances, and printing landrecords (used frequently in official business), and so forth. Education: In most cases today, \"education\" at rural kiosks is about computer-skills training. Those with even just a basic familiarity with word processors and spreadsheets become eligible for relatively well-paying data-entry jobs. In some kiosks, typinglessons are also a source of income. In a few cases, a kiosk offerstutoring services or distance learning for academic fundamentals.Results of school entrance exams can be accessed at some kiosks- this service is in great demand during certain times of the year. Communication: Projects such as n-Logue offer communica- tion services that leverage their unique connectivity solution.These wireless connectivity solutions also provide some villageswith their only phone. For younger customers who are curious 12Based on a 2004 study by Digital Partners and Intel that polled 30 kiosks in three states with village populations averaging 5,000 residents.A survey of rural kiosks in India 60about computers and life elsewhere, e-mail and chat become instant favourites. Less popular, but not unheard of is videoconferencing. In some regions, V oIP is growing in popularity,especially for those who have relatives overseas. Agriculture services: Many kiosks are intended to provide accurate and relevant information to the working villager. Market prices for agricultural products, discussion boards for farmers, and remote consultation with experts are common applications. Usersmay be suspicious of information delivered through kiosks at first, but will issue test questions to the system to verify its usefulness. Entertainment: Video games are a driving application at a few kiosks, mostly among pre-teen kids. Photo services - rent- ing digital cameras and selling prints - are very popular in kiosks that have this capability. In certain areas, listening tomusic, receiving sports updates or watching videos are common. However, at one kiosk visited, the kiosk operator preferred not to allow movie watching, as it dominated kiosk usage. Community/religion: Job searches on the Internet are not un- common. Astrology is taken seriously in many communities, and believers will pay for computer-generated horoscopes. One kioskoperator was able to post a profit solely from sales of astrologi- cal charts. Matchmaking services are also quite popular - often these services are utilized by the family of the prospectivebrides and grooms. Professional services: Health services (telemedicine) can be provided over the Internet, either through e-mail or video-conferencing. Also, banks and insurance companies have begun to tap into the large rural market, by offering basic services online or at nearby kiosks. Beyond the obvious surface value of these applications, rural kiosks also contribute immediate and lasting gains to their local economies. For one thing, the kiosk itself often provides a new livelihood for the kiosk operator and brings with it both income and respect. Most operators express unqualified satisfaction with their kiosks - even when struggling to break even. Another boost comes from computer-skills education and typing lessons which can make a student eligible for data-entry jobs that pay relatively well. Moreover, timely access to fair market prices can consis- tently bring as much as several percentage points of additional profit to farmers for their produce (figure 11). Lastly, kiosks have some less quantifiable, but socially significant effects. In many cases, a kiosk not only brings the first PC to a village, but the first tangible presence of state government or local enterprise. The kiosk can therefore, help to build trust between villagers and the organiza- tion implementing the kiosks. Within the village itself, kiosks can contrib- ute to social cohesion. Often as a result of the entrepreneurial efforts of the kiosk operators, or the nature of kiosk-related activities, groups of villagersA survey of rural kiosks in India 61are brought together, quickly establishing the kiosk itself as a social centre. A final example is increased opportunity for women. Many kiosk operators are women, and for them, the kiosk represents an empowering livelihood outside of traditional village roles. Figure 11. Proud kiosk operators in Tiruvallur, Jategao and Ding Mandi Needs and challenges Given their placement in rural locations among impoverished popula- tions, it is not surprising that rural kiosk projects face similar challenges,even amidst the diversity in geography, culture, and language. In projectafter project, the same obstacles arise. Most projects face the same operational hurdles, first, when setting up kiosks and later, in trying to generate enough revenue to sustain themselves: Start-up costs are high: The minimum cost for a single kiosk installation is typically around US$ 1,000 - the yearly incomeof a rural villager - including both hardware and software. Most often, this investment is made by the village kiosk operators themselves, the majority of whom will be required take out aloan (some will take advantage of government loan programmesdesigned for the poor). Infrastructural obstacles are severe: Many villages only have power for a few hours a day and telephone landlines extend at most to 4 per cent of the rural population. These problems are most easily handled with hardware solutions. These solutions, however,add to the total start-up cost for a kiosk (up to US$ 6,000) and itremains unclear whether this cost can be made up in the long run. Kiosks are critically dependent on good kiosk operators: At the kiosks themselves, the single most reliable predictor of revenue appears to be the entrepreneurial capacity of the kiosk operator. So, successful kiosk projects expend a lot of resources identifyingpotential operators and training them. Preferred traits include asecondary school education, experience with a business, marketingsavvy, middle-to-high social standing in the village, and a family -children often are quickest to pick up new technology, and siblings and parents can help run the shop. The better training programmesA survey of rural kiosks in India 62run for at least several sessions and teach skills ranging from mouse usage to basic bookkeeping and marketing. Kiosks are sensitive to location and population density: Greater foot traffic leads to greater returns. Some of the more profitablekiosks include: one located in a government office complex, and the other in a successful \"mom-and-pop\" pharmacy, located right on the town's main avenue. Some projects will also specifyconditions for a village's eligibility for a kiosk: a minimumpopulation (e.g. 5,000), greater or lesser accessibility from cities,and relevance to the project leader's core business (e.g. crop type). There is no single killer application: Different applications make different kiosks successful. There is no one class of applications that works at all locations, and the primary generatorof revenue at kiosks differs from village to village. Adaptation tolocal needs is necessary if a kiosk project hopes to endure.Diversified offerings also help - gradually, rural kiosks appear tobe converging upon offering a smorgasbord of applications. Rural kiosks, of course, demand considerable innovations in technol- ogy. Indeed, some kiosk projects claim that their primary contribution isitself technological (as with n-Logue's connectivity solution). The standardPC set-up that works in first-world white-collar offices works surprisingly well in rural environments, but there are still a few additional technical problems that should be addressed. In hardware, for example, there arechallenges in the following (figure 12): Power management: Batteries, solar power, UPS, and genera- tors offer more reliable power, but further innovation in low-power systems and power management is valuable. Connectivity: Poor connectivity is handled through VSAT satel- lite dishes or specially developed wireless access corDECT). Mobile wireless, WiFi, and WiMAX tech- nologies are likely to become more important as time goes on. Rugged hardware: Rural PCs are often located in dusty rooms with poor ventilation and no air conditioning. Hardware that isrobust to these conditions and to extremes of weather is desir-able. Inexpensive solutions in common use against dust includevinyl covers and plastic bags wrapped over equipment. Most kiosk operators consistently mention two features they would like to see: Language localization: This is a frequently asked-for feature. Some percentage of villagers can read in their local language,but are less than comfortable with English. Even where thekiosk operator is able to understand English, he or she will request language-localized versions of software for the sake of other villagers or for his/her own ease of use.A survey of rural kiosks in India 63UIs for the illiterate and semi-literate: Many kiosk users want simplified UIs that do not require fluent literacy. One kiosk operator, for example, suggested that the PC should be able tosay words aloud when moving the mouse over text. Other features that could help rural kiosks include the following: Automated PC management: Because kiosk operators have minimal training with PC management, there is a need forsecurity features, system-lockdown capability, and portable pro- file management. Remote management might also be a possibil- ity, but poor connectivity must be taken into account. Disconnected or very-low-bandwidth operation: Since connec- tivity can be unreliable, features that offer nearly seamlessoperation bridging connected and disconnected states would appearto be useful (e.g. automatic download of data when connected). Transliteration and translation software, multilingual sys-tems: India is extremely diverse in the number of languages spoken, and no single language is a nationwide lingua franca . Thus, systems which allow communication across language bar-riers and allow easy switching between languages seem useful. Speech-based UIs and alternative input devices (e.g. pen): Again, these would address issues with literacy and unfamiliarity with mouse and keyboard. These latter features are those that we, as sophisticated computer users, imagine would be useful given our observations. But rural villagers exhibit a lot of patience with their software. Most seemed quite happy to learn the sequence of steps required to engage with the PC - for them, anyinconvenience due to deficiencies in power, connectivity, or usability, palesin comparison to the alternatives, which might require lengthy trips into thecity or tortuous dealings with absurd bureaucracies. Figure 12. Kiosk hardware: n-Logue wireless access tower, solar-charged lamp and UPS, VSAT satellite dish for connectivity Other salient characteristics Beyond usage scenarios and challenges, there are a few additional traits that most kiosk projects share.A survey of rural kiosks in India 64All projects have the socio-economic development of rural regions as a goal: This motive extends even to the front lines - one kiosk operator applied his profits toward a community hand pump. On the kiosk side, target customers are motivated by a desire to improve their living conditions, in contrast to Internet caf\u00e9-goers who mainly seek entertainment or social interaction. Government is frequently involved: Many kiosk projects start either as government initiatives or as entrepreneurial projects to bring government services to rural areas. Even projects that begin as purely commercial ventures often end up partnering with government. Especially as a project scales to hundreds or thousands of villages, the cooperation of government is neces- sary and can expedite expansion. The leading kiosk projects develop their own content asweb-based services: This strategy allows the centralization of development efforts, easy language localization, and reliable transaction monitoring. Business models are still being tested: Most projects are wrestling with different approaches and offerings; breaking even as a business is not trivial. On the other hand, if kiosks succeed in achieving economic growth for rural communities, it changes the business landscape they operate in, possibly weakening their own raison d'\u00eatre . Whatever the case, the future of rural kiosks is difficult to predict. One thing that seems certain is that kiosks will probably evolve rapidly and dramatically before reaching equilibrium. Many projects will fail. A few will survive - though not necessarily in their current form. Alternatives to PC-based kiosks Mobile phones seem the most likely candidate to serve as a viable alternative to PC-based kiosks. In emerging markets worldwide, mobile phones have spread with unforeseen speed. Leap-frogging landline infra- structure, mobile phones are becoming common even among the poor. Providing connectivity at reasonable costs and increasingly greater process- ing power, they could easily supplant PCs as the gateway to information and electronic services. In particular, of the seven classes of kiosk applica- tions listed above, only one or two are dependent on the PC as such. It is also possible that the most compelling scenarios will be hybrid experiences, where a shared-access kiosk provides a full Internet experience occasionally, and pre-paid mobile phones provide a shallow experience continuously. Neither mobile providers nor computing firms have emerged with such a solution thus far. Aside from mobile phones, other hardware that could bring computing to rural populations include TV set-top boxes and other low-cost form factors that offer a feature-poor computing experience. Both of these approaches dramatically reduce the cost of hardware, which is the one input cost that hasA survey of rural kiosks in India 65a hard lower bound. Such devices could be paired with web services that provide much of the frequent-use functionality in PC kiosks. L. From a small beginning to a mass movement - National Alliance for Mission 2007: Every village is a knowledge centre Mr. S. Senthilkumaran, Associate Director, Informatics Division, M. S. Swaminathan Research Foundation Despite outstanding achievements in the areas of ICT and high technology, two state governments belonging to two different parties in the general election of India early this year have failed to return to power, largely because the rural poor felt that the benefits of these technologies did not reach them - a point consistently made by Professor Swaminathan ever since the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF) was established in 1991. MSSRF held an Interdisciplinary Dialogue on Information Technol- ogy: Reaching the Unreached in January 1992 with the support of IDRC. The dialogue revealed that the future of food security in the developing world, especially South Asia, is dependent less on resource intensive agriculture than on knowledge intensity. The concept of Information Village can be traced to the dialogue in 1992. MSSRF believes that information and communication technologies can play a major role in environmentally sustainable rural development, not only reaching the poor but also helping them to achieve food security and social justice. The key step is the value addition made to information in order to render it locale specific. The Information Village Research Project was started in January 1998 in Pondicherry in Southern India. There are certain advantages in Pondicherry. The bio-village programme helps the villagers use the available resources in a sustainable way as an additional source of income by using biological tools. The ICT programme complements the bio-village programme. Bio-village activities include fish pond management, mushroom cultivation, rainwater harvesting, cultivation of pulses, and ornamental fish growing. The main aim of these activities is to stop the degradation of the existing resource base. From earlier research in 11 villages, MSSRF found that the reach of electronic media, especially television, was reasonably high considering the prevalence of poverty in the villages surveyed. There was less than one phone per 500 people. This seemed to indicate that the rural families were ready to subscribe to a cable TV service, even though they were poor. In other words, people are ready to adopt technologies if they see some value in them. By conducting detailed surveys covering 10 per cent of the resident families it was found that the predominant sources of information were the local shopkeeper, the market place, and the input supplier. A considerableFrom a small beginning to a mass movement - National Alliance for Mission 2007: Every village is a knowledge centre 66amount of information transaction takes place between the rural poor households and this also acts as a primary source of information. This is the hub-and-spokes model with Villianur as the hub. The MSSRF field experience shows that community ownership and participationare necessary conditions for success. Setting up of these Village Knowledge Centres was preceded by large-scale consultation with the local communi- ties. In each case, the community provided an accessible rent-free building,electricity and volunteers, many of them women. In turn, the projectprovided all the needed equipment, training and help in collecting data. Theproject volunteers were not paid, but the rural community did have a senseof ownership over the centres. VHF and Spread Spectrum Technology are used for communications and a hybrid solar photovoltaic power to generate electricity. With the help of the University of Berkeley, 802.11g technologyhas been installed in one fishing village. From the field experience, three points were found to be important when starting village knowledge centres. The first is community ownership- the community as a whole must endorse it, it should not be considered ademonstration. Secondly, \"usefulness\" is more important than the use of latest technology. Lastly, it should not be associated with any one group or caste; everyone should be allowed to take part. Creation and updating of relevant content to suit local needs is a key factor in the programme. Prior to commencing content-building activity,extensive consultations were held with the participating village communitiesthrough small group meetings. Based on the requirement of the localcommunity, MSSRF developed several databases to fulfill their require- ments. These are frequently updated. A considerable part of the information is accessed from the local sources. Knowledge of grain sale prices in various markets in and around Pondicherry is critical to farmers during the harvest season. This informa-tion helps the farmers market their produce profitably. Jute bag sellers alsocheck the market information. Farmers, especially before harvesting, and brick-makers check the weather report. Women vegetable sellers and agri- cultural labourers check the vegetable market prices and where farm workis available. From the user register, it was revealed that most of thevillagers used the entitlement database. Many people look up addresses ofdoctors, especially specialists and ambulance services, for their family, andthe addresses of veterinarians for their livestock. The education database describes the courses available in nearby schools, colleges and also neighbouring states along with cost information. Three Village Knowledge Centres are located at coastal villages with 98 per cent of the families involved in fishing. The information require-ments in these villages are different and are more focused on the safety offisherman while at sea and on fish occurrence near shore. These villagesalso receive information on wave heights 48 hours in advance, downloadedFrom a small beginning to a mass movement - National Alliance for Mission 2007: Every village is a knowledge centre 67from the United States of America Navy Web site.13 MSSRF broadcasts the interpreted information through a public address (PA) system for the benefit of fishermen. The PA system is also used for announcing variousgovernment schemes related to fishermen on a regular basis, fish marketdetails, employment news, distribution of rice, kerosene, sugar, etc. in thelocal fair price shops. MSSRF is using both traditional and moderntechnologies to spread the information to the villages. MSSRF also provides potential fishing zone information to the fishing community through the electronic display board. The data is up- dated every three days from the Indiann National Centre for Ocean Information Service (INCOIS) through telephone. More than half the volunteers are women. This was a deliberate decision which has positively resulted in an increase in the number of women users. In the evening some Knowledge Centres provide counselling to women. Many of them form self-help groups and use loans for theeducation of their children and starting up cottage industries. Knowledge Centres help women get training related to new economic opportunities such as incense stick manufacturing, mushroom production, coir roping,ornamental fish growing, etc. In the fishing villages, Knowledge Centres organize training in making ornamental artefacts from shells. Bank loans can also be arranged to the self-help groups to assist them to make market linkages for their products by attending government exhibitions. MSSRF has developed accounting software for self-help groups with the help of the District Rural Development Agency. This assists the groupsto keep their accounts regularly and submit monthly reports to banks and the District Rural Development Agency. In the past, it was found that several self-help groups had difficulty maintaining their accounts properly.Now, the groups can scrutinize their accounts. At present, in Pondicherry, banks and the District Rural Develop- ment Agency largely provide loans to start up dairy units. MSSRF wants tospread information on micro-enterprises to the rural community and, with the help of rural artisans and the District Information Centre has, developed a multi-media CD that contains information on ten micro-enterprises. MSSRF has given training to village volunteers on the use of computers - for typing, formatting pages, picture editing, data analysis and presentation. After the training each village volunteer submits individual project reports and brochures. Following the training, villagers are able toget work, for instance, designing wedding cards, invitations, and typing college project work. Besides providing computer classes for students and conducting computer examinations, MSSRF also provides training in basicsystem maintenance and troubleshooting to the village volunteers. 13https://www.navo.navy.mil/LIBRARY/Metoc/Indian+Ocean/Bay+of+Bengal/MODELS/ SWAPS/Sig+Wav+Ht+and+Dir+Series/index.htmlFrom a small beginning to a mass movement - National Alliance for Mission 2007: Every village is a knowledge centre 68The impact of the Knowledge Centres improved dramatically when a twice-monthly newsletter called \"Nammavur Seithi\" [News of our village]was launched in February 2002. Villagers were encouraged to write articlesabout several issues, while village children also submitted drawings andarticles. Government officials, NGOs and private companies are also pro- viding useful information regularly to the newletter. In 2004, the commu- nity newspaper network was expanded to 35 villages based on the demand.Further more, government departments and All India Radio have included\"Nammavur Seithi\" for dissemination along with regular newspapers. Arural yellow pages carrying advertisements has also been created. Many village elders have traditional knowledge in various fields, but they are not necessarily able to share the information with other people, or may not think that the information is important for others or may even assume that everybody already knows it. During the \"Nammavur Seithi\" content collection,village people were approached in search of traditional knowledge, particularlyin the area of health. Several interactive meetings have also been conductedwith Seva Foundation (SEVA), an NGO. So far, more than 600 herbalremedies related to human and animal health have been collected. MSSRF also worked with the Rajiv Gandhi College of Veterinary and Animal Sciences (RGCOV AS) in Pondicherry to provide animal hus-bandry knowledge through touch screen demonstrations and field leveltraining. MSSRF has partnered with Aravind Eye Hospital in Pondicherryto initiate a movement to prevent blindness in the rural villages. It hasorganized village-level awareness meetings along with paramedical staff. In these meetings, different eye diseases are explained, as are prevention and treatment techniques through diagrammatic presentation. The Hospital nowprovides training for MSSRF Village Knowledge Centre workers on how toidentify long-sightedness, shortsightedness and cataracts. After KnowledgeCentre workers have conducted an eyesight survey of a village they sendthe electronic patient records to Aravind Eye Hospital along with the digital photograph of the problematic eyes. An ophthalmology assistant screens the patient records and finalizes the type of treatment and date. Another initiative is to create TB-free zones with the help of the Tuberculosis Research Centre (TRC). The centre has kindly started toprovide training for village knowledge workers on identifying TB patients. Two experts have been nominated for this purpose by TRC. TRC has provided all the education materials. In the past six years, this project has been the source of several success stories. For instance, based on government entitlements information,several women have received loans and have started their own businesses. Some have obtained training in new business opportunities. Village women volunteers and self-help group members have now established good rela-tionships with government departments and officials and contest localelections. Through market information, farmers are able to get a betterFrom a small beginning to a mass movement - National Alliance for Mission 2007: Every village is a knowledge centre 69price for their grains from different markets. Information provided on various farming techniques and pest control methods has also helped therural community extensively. Many farmers have learnt about inter-croppingand multi-cropping and now use such techniques in their fields. The animalhusbandry database is very popular as are doctors' addresses and the wireless phone (in emergencies) facility. School teachers are using MSSRF's educational CDs to improve science and arithmetic knowledge among local children. Teachers are ableto prepare test papers using the computers in the knowledge centres and issue printed question papers to students. Children, students and anyone else that is interested can get training in MS Office, Adobe PageMaker andAdobe Photoshop. Teenagers who have computer skills can surf the Internet and develop market linkages for their parents and communities with compa- nies making products needed by their village, such as milk powder andfruit juice. Through the Internet, many students receive their public exami- nation results and marked papers, education course details, software devel- opment details, entrance examination results and medical counselling. Manycollege and research students also prepare their project reports using the knowledge centre computers; as do farmers, especially before harvesting, and brick makers who use the Knowledge Centres to check the weatherreport. Employment news provided by the Knowledge Centres has also been found to be very useful. Private companies and employee unions are also using Knowledge Centre systems to prepare their accounts, salarycertificates, subscription details, employee details, etc. This project won the Motorola Dispatch Solution Gold Award and Stockholm Challenge Award, and Scientific American recently selected this project as one of the best 50 projects from all over the world. As a result of MSSRF's experience with Rural Knowledge Centres, the National Virtual Academy (NV A) for Food Security and Rural Prosperity was developed, which aims to bring together experts and grassroots commu- nities. The main objective of the NVA is to assist knowledge to reach every home and hut. The State-level hub located at MSSRF will be the key knowledge resource that will create and maintain Web sites and databases for the local hubs in close collaboration with national and international agencies. It will also serve as the primary data provider tied with research institutions, field stations and government extension departments. The State-level hub links with block level or equivalent hubs in the State. The latter serves a cluster of villages. Therefore, we are developing an information system that connects lab-to-lab, lab-to-land, land-to-lab and land-to-land. The Academy aims to bring frontier technology to resource-poor rural women and men and to empower them to take charge of their destinies. It will help to create large numbers of knowledge managers in villages, most of whomwill be women. In the initial step, six Fellows of NV A have been selected through a rigorous selection process. A further 1,000 Fellows are in the process of being selected from all over India with the help of several partners.From a small beginning to a mass movement - National Alliance for Mission 2007: Every village is a knowledge centre 70MSSRF launched the Open Knowledge Network (OKN) in collabo- ration with OneWorld International. OKN is a human network which collects, shares and disseminates information in local language and seeks tocontribute knowledge about health, local culture and practices, education, agriculture, government schemes, jobs and markets. Through this network, access points from India and Africa share local news through a WorldSpaceSatellite and Internet. The local news is produced in Tamil and Swahili and the meta tags are in English. Until recently the Government of India has not provided permission for Community Radio broadcasting. Therefore, to overcome this restriction and to reach as larger audience as possible, MSSRF have started an Internet radio station. MSSRF conducted a Policy Makers Workshop on 8 to 9 October 2004. The main aim of the workshop was to sensitize policy makers to critical issues in the use of ICTs to promote human development in ruralareas. More than 60 participants took part. One of the recommendations of the workshop was: \"Every village - a knowledge centre: There is a need for developing a master plan coupled with a business plan for extending the benefits of ICT to all the 600,000 villages in India by 2007, which marks the 60 th anniversary of our Independence. The master plan should help to link technology-knowledge-rural women and men in a symbiotic manner. The investment needs will have to be estimated and business plans prepared. A National Alliance for ICT for Poverty Eradication may be established for launching the Every Village - a Knowledge Centre movement. Such an alliance should include the private sector, cooperatives, NGOs, R&D institutions, women's associa- tions, mass media and appropriate government agencies.\" A Jamsetji Tata consultation on forming a National Alliance for Agenda 2007: Every Village a Knowledge Centre was conducted on 19 to 20 May 2004. Some of the important outcomes of the National Consultation were: The National Alliance for Mission 2007, representing a coalition of the concerned will facilitate and accelerate the spread of the rural knowledge centre movement and will function, like the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), without a legal structure. At the village level, on the basis of local dynamics, a committeewill be formed in consultation with the Gram Sabha 14 for managing the knowledge centres. This committee will help to organize training, capacity building, and peer-to-peer learning 14Gram Sabha are Indian traditional village councils. It is a body consisting of persons registered in the electoral rolls of a village or group of villages.From a small beginning to a mass movement - National Alliance for Mission 2007: Every village is a knowledge centre 71among the knowledge workers and local entrepreneurs. These may be Panchayats, self-help groups, common interest groups, human networks or community-based organizations. There are numerous ICT tools - Internet, cable TV, radio,cellphone and the vernacular press. The National Alliance does not believe in the absolute superiority of any particular tool, but rather that using an appropriate mix of these tools would benefit the people the most. The Steering Committee for Mission 2007 comprises governmental and civil society organizations and the media, private sector, professionals and academia. The Mission is to be implemented on the principle of social inclusion, social relevance and gender equity. Transaction costs will be kept low, and fostering the growth of an ICT-self-help movement will create a sense of ownership. This research project was initiated on a small level and expanded during the process from covering 12 villages to now over 600,000 villages in India. Partners include academia, research institutions, government depart- ments, Panchayat Raj institutions, civil society organizations, banks, private companies and industry associations. As the task is large and the time is limited, the only way to achieve the goal is through forging partnerships and forming networks. Through ICT self-help groups, the Alliance will operate rural knowledge centres, community newspapers, Internet and cable radio, e- education, e-health and ICT-based business activities. Under the National Virtual Academy three block level offices have been connected with the help of ISRO. Through this network, services such as e-education, e-medicine, online decision support, interactive farmers'advisory services, Tele-fishery, e-governance, and weather and water man- agement services can be provided. This programme will cover both farming and fishing families, based on the motto: \"Food, water, health, literacy andwork for all and for ever\". Under Mission 2007, ISRO, the Farmers Commission, the Planning Commission and the Ministry of Rural Development are in the process ofsetting up Village Resource Centres in 150 districts, identified as Farmers Distress Hot Spots. Currently, Mission 2007 is setting up regional chapters in four districts with two guiding principles - Antoyodaya and Trusteeship. M. Models of community e-centres for the poor Mr. Wimal Gunawardena, Chairman/Managing Director, TEAMS (Pvt) Limited Introduction: a specific project In the Information Age where information is considered to be a vital resource for achieving our missions and needs, both individually and collectively. Information and communication technologies (ICT) can provideModels of community e-centres for the poor 72a wide array of information, accurately and quickly, to meet people's requirements, facilitating the building of constructive social capital from the point of view of the rural poor. ICT can strongly contribute to poverty reduction by enhancing income generating opportunities including employ- ment for people with a low income. Information plays a crucial role in the livelihood of people, while integrating them into communities, nations and global economies. In Sri Lanka, like in most of the developing countries, the use of ICT has been limited to a small segment of the population, which isconsidered to be the privileged group. The community at large and espe-cially people with low incomes in Sri Lanka have not benefited from ICTdue to the high costs of service providers coupled with the lack of suitableand accessible facilities. Recently, there have been some attempts to introduce ICT to the poor, especially those living in rural areas. One such attempt, under theauspices of the Asian Development Bank and the Ministry of Education,was the Community Information Project for the Poor (CIPP) of Sri Lankawhich was commenced in September 2003. The project involves thetransfer of ICT to members of low-income communities. The main purpose of the CIPP project is to create opportunities for people with low incomes to participate in economic growth by providingthem with vital information. This is a pilot project, in the form of aTechnical Assistance (TA) grant given by the Asian Development Bank.The project is implemented by TEAMS Consultants. The Government ofSri Lanka has developed a vision statement \"e-Sri Lanka: An ICT Develop-ment Roadmap,\" with the goal of taking ICT to every village, business andcitizen. In these terms, the CIPP could be seen as a way of assessing thefeasibility of achieving this goal. Organization of community information centres and models used CIPP involves three major components: (1) Establishment of commu- nity information networks (CINs) in each selected district for the provisionof information services for the poor; (2) capacity building and skillsdevelopment among local stakeholders for managing CINs and for the poorto use information services; and (3) social preparation for sustainability ofthe ICT services by local stakeholders beyond the project period. The project has established community information networks in three selected districts of Sri Lanka - the Gampaha, Ratnapura and KalutaraDistricts. Each network has one district community information centre(CIC) and ten village information centres (VICs). These three networks arecoordinated by a project implementation unit (PIU) operating from theMinistry of Education (figure 13). The project period is 15 months fromSeptember 2003.Models of community e-centres for the poor 73The target group of the project are those who receive a monthly income of less than Rs. 3,000 (US$ 30) and low income groups such asfarmers, labourers, plantation workers and fishermen. The aim of CIPP isthe provision of vital information to the poor for their livelihood improve-ment, not simply providing ICT skills training for the people. However, theproject involves providing basic computer literacy for the beneficiaries toaccess information. Extensive training is also provided to the operators ofCICs and VICs and members of stakeholder groups on the use of computerhardware and software and the Internet. This is to ensure that the localoperators can handle the operation and maintenance of the networks by theend of the project. The project also explores ways in which people of lowincome can access public and private sector services at a minimum cost.The maximum contribution from the communities of the relevant districts istapped to ensure their ownership and active participation. At the inception, the three CINs were established with three different service provision models in mind. The network of the Gampaha districtwas initiated as a model of e-governance linking public entities such asdivisional offices, public extensions service centres, government training/skills development centres, public health centres and state enterprises. Thenetwork of the Ratnapura district started as a model of e-commerce linking private entities such as private clinics, private schools, businesses, etc. Themodel used for establishing the Kalutara district network was a combina-tion of both e-governance and e-commerce. The project anticipated to learnfor future projects from these three networks by taking these as casestudies. In other words, as a secondary project objective, it was envisagedto learn lessons on how e-commerce and e-governance could effectivelyreach the low income people.PIU (Ministry of 10 VICs 10 VICs Figure 13. Structure of community information centresModels of community e-centres for the poor 74The CICs and VICs were established in locations that could be served by various agencies without charging a rent. In choosing thelocations the following criteria were taken into account: Readiness of the agency to provide a suitable area Degree of accessibility to members of poor communities and degree of centrality of the location Provision of appropriate space and infrastructure by the relevant agency to establish the CIC or VIC Safety and security aspects of the location Geographical location Distribution of VICs to represent different rural communities and/or different community cross-sections, economic activities and resources in the district Likely contribution to future sustainability All three CICs are situated in locations provided by Local Authori- ties (Town Councils) in those districts. The VICs are situated in a widerange of locations such as divisional secretariats, local authorities, public libraries, market complexes, cooperatives, NGOs, Buddhist learning centres and divisional education offices. There is one VIC focusing specifically onsoldiers with disabilities which is located at an Army Rehabilitation Centre. The PIU, CICs and VICs were structured with the relevant technical expertise. In addition to the project staff, the Government of Sri Lanka appointed a counterpart staff for the project (a manager at the PIU level and coordinator for each district). With ADB funding, each CIC has beenequipped with 18 computers including a local server, fax machine, scanner, photocopier, digital video camera, multimedia projector, printers, PDAs, mobile phones, telephone, Internet connection etc. The transport require-ments of CICs were facilitated by providing them with a vehicle and five motorcycles. Each VIC has been provided with a computer, fax machine, telephone and Internet connection. Operational details of community information centres In accordance with the vision of the Project, the exact profile of information services to be provided by each CIN was fully tailored to meet the priorities of the community and to be continuously updated. For thispurpose, an information needs assessment survey was undertaken at an early stage of the project to understand and prioritize the community information needs of each project district. From the inception, it was recognized that in order to attract the target group (those with a monthly income of less that Rs. 3,000) there was a need firstly to attract certain \"opinion leaders\" who could act as catalystswithin the rural community to make use of the services provided by theCIPP. These opinion leaders included teachers, Grama Niladharis (villagelevel officials) Samurdhi officials, agriculture extension officials, membersof the clergy, officials of people's organizations (such as farmers' organiza- tions, rural development societies and women's groups). Action was takenModels of community e-centres for the poor 75to attract these village opinion leaders and then in turn to attract the target group with their assistance. The information needs assessment surveyconducted in the three districts included a sample encompassing the target group as well as the opinion leaders mentioned above. The information needs assessment survey provided some insights into the status of accessibility of ICT services for the poor in rural communities in the Gampaha, Ratnapura and Kalutara districts. The availability of and accessto ICT for members of rural and poor communities was found to be very limited in all the three project districts. The survey revealed that for the Gampaha district, only five per cent of the respondents had access tocomputers and only seven per cent considered themselves computer literate; for the Ratnapura district only three per cent of the respondents had access to computers and only six per cent considered themselves computer literate; forthe Kalutara district only four per cent of the respondents had access to computers and only five per cent considered themselves computer literate. The survey also revealed that very few of the respondents in the threedistricts had access to the Internet, e-mail, or facsimile. For example, in Gampaha only two per cent of the respondents had access to the Internet and e-mail; only three per cent had access to a fax; while 47 per cent had accessto telephone facilities. A large percentage of the respondents had access to radio, television and newspaper modes of communication. The number one priority category of information required for each project district differed, but overall the ten most sought-after information categories in these districts were: (i) education; (ii) prices of commodities;(ix) public services; and (x) subsidies. At the very early stage it was recognized that a reasonable quantum of information desired by the poor was not available in electronic form in the Web sites operated by different institutions and departments. Suchinformation was available only in \"hard form\" as leaflets, booklets, manuals and brochures. The CICs were instructed to collect these sources of information. It was decided to serve the poor with information available inboth electronic and hard form to meet all their needs. The survey clearly indicated that the great majority of people required information from both the private and public sectors. As the main purpose of the project was to serve the poor with the information required for livelihood improvement based on their needs, the views of the benefi-ciary groups were given prominence over the second objective of the project which was to learn lessons by trialling the CINs using three different service models. As a result, all three CINs have been serving thepoor with both public and private sector information, a combination of e- governance and e-commerce models. In other words the project recognized that community information services for the poor should be based on themodel of the people's needs rather than being limited to preconceived models such as e-governance and e-commerce.Models of community e-centres for the poor 76The Community Information Networks (CINs) in the project districts have linked district offices, schools, training institutes, job placementcentres, hospitals, markets, private companies and villages, in order to share vital information with local communities, using cost-effective and feasible communication modes. The types of information provided include jobopportunities, education and training opportunities, agriculture services, health and medical information, weather and disaster warnings, public announcements, commodity and crop prices, and banking. Based on the information needs assessment, the project has estab- lished a national level community web site as well as three district level community web sites to collect and disseminate information required by the low-income groups. In each district, important information is collected dailyby the information collectors at the CIC, utilizing motorcycles. Similarly, the information collectors attached to the PIU are responsible for collecting important information at the national level. These project web sites arecontinuously updated by obtaining the views of the district level steering committees. However, there are limitations as many departments and insti- tutes with vital information have no Web sites that could network to theproject Web sites. Important information is collected daily by information collectors, based on an analysis of the demand for information by the target group.The collected information is analyzed, verified and uploaded to the web sites of the project districts immediately. Newsflashes are prepared daily in each district to highlight news and important information in the district.This news is disseminated daily to VICs through electronic mail (e-mail) or facsimile, to ensure that key information reaches target beneficiaries with- out delay. Monthly newsletters are also published in three languagesproviding further information services to the target groups. Information collectors continually feed back information from community groups in terms of their information requirements. Several activities were undertaken to attract target groups to the centres and to assist capacity building and skills development for managing CICs and VICs. The main activities undertaken were: (i) Setting-up andactivating steering committees in all the CICs and VICs; (ii) conducting community awareness and promotional programmes; (iii) conducting train- ing programmes for CIC operators and VIC operators; (iv) conducting basictraining programmes for improving the computer literacy of members of local communities; and (v) developing strategies for the future sustainability of the project. Awareness raising strategies have been developed and implemented in order to create community awareness and promote community participa- tion in the project. The community awareness strategies that have been adopted so far include creating awareness through: (a) the media; (b)ceremonial inaugurations at the CICs and VICs; (c) special workshops; (d) project leaflets, posters, banners; and (e) training programmes.Models of community e-centres for the poor 77Achievements and future sustainability Over the past year, CIPP has served a significant number of rural people in the districts of Gampaha, Kalutara and Ratnapura. According to the records maintained in the CICs and VICs, approximately 31,000 members of the ruralcommunity in the Gampaha district have used the services provided by the Gampaha CIN. Among these users about 41 per cent belong to Samurdhi recipient families (Samurdhi recipients are people with a monthly income ofless than Rs. 1,500, who are given special government assistance for poverty alleviation). These families live below the poverty threshold and are thus classified as the poorest of the poor. Also, according to the records, over 75per cent of the users of the CIN are classified as poor (i.e. have an income of less than Rs. 3000) and the most sought-after information categories/types by the information seekers using the Gampaha CIN were information onemployment opportunities; information related to education; and information related to industries. Although the majority of the users (about 58 per cent) were served with electronic information, about 42 per cent were served withinformation available at the centre in \"hard form\". The CIN of the Ratnapura district has been patronized by over 17,000 rural poor of whom about 36 per cent are Samurdhi recipients. Hereagain, the majority of the users obtained their specific information require- ments via the Web/Internet, while the others were served with information available in the centres in hard form. According to the records maintained,the most sought-after information categories by the information seekers using the Ratnapura CIN were information on employment opportunities; information related to education; and information related to agriculture. About 18,500 rural poor have visited the CIN of the Kalutara district of which about 32 per cent are Samurdhi recipients. Once again the majority of the users visiting the centres obtained specific informationusing Web/Internet sources. According to the records maintained, the most sought-after information categories by the information seekers using the Kalutara CIN were information on employment opportunities; informationrelated to education; and information related to agriculture. The performance of the CICs and VICs and the overall progress of the project was monitored continuously. A mid-term project review was con- ducted by the ADB and the Ministry of Education together with the project consultants. While progress in general was acceptable, project achievements in terms of providing important information to the project target group was found to be inadequate. Consequently, the organizational structure of the project and the implementation strategies were re-structured. In this process, the terms of reference of the consultants (the project team) and the required qualifications of the consultants were re-formulated focusing on \"social mobilization\", \"outreach to the poor\" and \"social preparation at the commu- nity level for sustainability of CINs\". With these changes, social mobilization and associated work became the main focus of the project. The project period was extended by four months, until the end of April 2005.Models of community e-centres for the poor 78It is anticipated that gradually, the community operators will take over information collection, analysis and verification, information uploading to the Web site, publication of news and services to the rural poor so that by the conclusion of the pilot project, the information network can be sustained by the community. Cost recovery measures will also be explored extensively by introducing user fees, paid advertisements, soliciting dona- tions. These measures will be determined by the steering committee of each district. This process is currently taking place. At present, ICT services are provided to the community via CICs and VICs at no charge. Although the main focus is to serve the target group mentioned earlier, any rural Sri Lankan can visit the CICs and VICs and use the computers if they are unoccupied. The project team recognized that a charge levying system needs to be implemented on a cost recovery basis for the CICs and VICs. In order to formulate the rates of the charging system, a rate survey was carried out in the three project districts. The rates are based on the lowest commercial rates for communication services. The main aim of the fee levying system is cost recovery, with no profits anticipated. Further, following the objectives of the project, subsidised rates are proposed for the target group members. It is proposed that the money collected by this charge levying scheme should be deposited in a separate account for each CIN and that proper accounting procedures should be maintained. The analysis of the results of the rate survey revealed that 80 per cent of the survey respondents were willing to pay for the services provided at the Gampaha district CIN, while 67 per cent were willing to pay for the services provided at the Ratnapura district CIN and 62 per cent of the survey respondents were willing to pay for the services provided at the Kalutara district CIN. This is an important factor when considering the design of strategies for the future sustainability of the project. From the very inception of the project, it was recognized that sustainability measures are important to guaranteeing the continuity of community ICT services to the poor. The following sustainability strategies were identified by the project team: 1. Ensure the active involvement and participation of relevant stakeholder organizations, institutions and the community in operating CINs; 2. Promote among the stakeholder organizations and the beneficiary groups the value of the services provided by the project and enhance community participation to improve the utilization ofICT services via community awareness programmes and com- puter literacy training programmes; 3. Establish and activate steering-committees of the CICs and VICs to improve the functioning of CICs and VICs and to facilitate the future sustainability of the CICs and VICs;Models of community e-centres for the poor 794. Develop workable and efficient cost-recovery measures for the sustainability of the CICs and VICs; 5. Encourage commitment by stakeholder organizations to take over the operation and running of the CICs and VICs; and 6. Undertake capacity building measures for CICs and VICs to operate by themselves and minimize the \"dependency syndrome\"on the TA team, towards the end of the TA. Currently, these strategies are being developed into an action plan with the help of the steering committees of the CICs and VICs. Issues faced and lessons learned There are many socio-economic and cultural barriers that need to be overcome to ensure that members of poor local communities freely adopt information and communication technology. Some of the main barriers that have been encountered by the project team during the course of the projectinclude: (a) a general lack of computer literacy; (b) a fear of modern technology and a natural reluctance to use new technology; (c) language barriers; (d) access problems in very remote rural areas; (e) frequent poweroutages, especially in the remote rural areas; (f) the costs involved in adopting information and communication technology; and (g) natural disas- ters including floods, landslides, etc. which cut off entire villages from therest of the world. These socio-economic and cultural barriers that need to be overcome to ensure that members of poor local communities freely adopt ICT, narrow the existing digital divide and empower poor rural communities to seek and achieve a better quality of life. One of the main difficulties faced during the project was the selection of appropriate locations for setting up the district CICs and VICs. This hasbeen difficult because the sites had to meet certain minimum project criteria or requirements. Locating and acquiring sites that meet these requirements or criteria has been difficult. Thus, a number of site evaluations, reviews andchanges had to undertaken in order to set-up the CICs and VICs. Another important constraint, especially in establishing the VICs, has been the technology scarcity in some areas in the project districts. Becausethe aim of the project is to reach poor people, there has been a need to establish the VICs in very rural areas, where services such as telephone connections, Internet connections. are scarce or even non-existent. Thistechnology barrier has delayed the setting up and operation of the VICs in all three districts. Also, undertaking activities such as building renovation and repairs and the provision of services such as electricity, telephoneconnections, Internet connections is quite a time consuming process. This has also delayed the setting up and operation of the VICs. The computer literacy of members of poor communities is very low. Hence, the need for more effective computer literacy training programmes andcommunity awareness programmes has been identified. Several computer literacy training programmes and awareness strategies were implemented and are continuing to be implemented for communities of the project districts.Models of community e-centres for the poor 80A reasonable volume of information desired by the rural poor was not available in electronic form due to limitations of web sites maintained byvarious institutes and departments. Therefore, the users visiting the centres were served with information both in \"electronic form\" and in \"hard form\". In setting up the project web sites, some technical difficulties were encoun-tered. This was mainly in relation to establishing the Web sites in the national languages of Sinhala and Tamil, where the consultants experienced some technical difficulties in adopting existing computer software to construct theWeb sites. However, these problems were resolved subsequently. As mentioned earlier, each of the CINs was established with a predetermined model in mind, models on e-governance, e-commerce and a combination of the two. However, the need as expressed by the CIN users, i.e. the rural poor, was to receive information covering aspects of both e-governance and e-commerce. Thus, perhaps the most important lesson from the project so far is that in a community information system such as the one explored in this project, the service model should be demand drivenand user centred rather than predetermined. This is important in order to achieve its mission and to ensure user support for sustainability. N. Economic analysis of community e-centres for rural development Mr. Jeong-Dong Lee, Associate Professor, Seoul National University and Ms. Hyunjung Lee, Economist, Asian Development Bank Most rural people have much lower levels of economic development and health, education, and general well being than their urban counterparts because of lack of access to universal services and markets. This is due to poor infrastructure provision such as transport and communication networksand deficient institutional systems for financial operations. The ultimate objective of rural development is improvement in the quality of life for rural people by removing the impediments of developing rural economiesand providing basic infrastructure in rural areas. Information and communi- cations technology (ICT) is one of the most effective tools for assisting rural communities to leapfrog over such hurdles to development. ICT is defined as a set of activities that facilitate the processing, transmission, and display of information by electronic means. Generally, ICT has made a great impact on economic growth and social development by: (1) enhancing the productivity and efficiency of existing sectors and industries; (2) creating new business and/or development opportunities, which would not be possible without ICT; (3) facilitating an open economy and promoting a competitive market environment through enhanced information accessibility; and (4) improving quality of life and human well-being through accessibility to various new e-services. However, in order to fully exploit those benefits from applying ICT to the existing economy, it is important to strengthen a set of complementary factors that assist the necessary socio-economic transforma- tion of the economy. These include the mind-sets of people, ways of communicating, the structure of the economy, and the level of literacy.Economic analysis of community e-centres for rural development 81To provide public access to ICT-based services and applications, community e-centres (CeC) have been recognized as a cost-effective facil- ity, especially in rural areas, given the limited resources and number of people who can afford ICT-based services. However, previous experience gained in establishing CeCs raises the issue of CeC sustainability as the most critical issue. Experiences show that although CeC is seen as sustain- able in the long-term once its socio-economic impact is realized, surviving up until that point is difficult due to the lack of a self-sustainability mechanisms and its inevitable reliance on public support. Therefore, due consideration should be given in the beginning, when designing and estab- lishing CeCs, to the long-term sustainability of the operation. In view of this, this presentation emphasizes the importance of flexible investment planning and decision-making processes. As an effective economic analysis tool to analyze flexible decision- making processes, the \"real option\" approach is introduced and explored in this presentation. Real option is defined as the right, but not the obligation, of investment to get the payoff from the investment decision in real assets and thus, it is a contingent claim on its value, which is dependent on uncertain future demand. The establishment of CeCs can be viewed as an initial investment for increasing e-awareness among local communities that creates a variety of follow-on commercial and social development opportu-nities. In this sense, investment in CeC can be regarded as a real option on future development and commercial impact. The real options valuation approach is useful, especially in situations where a high degree of uncer- tainty exists and large up-front investment is needed that will be followed by several subsequent investment opportunities like investment in CeC. The role of ICT for development In the shift from the Industrial Age of the 20 th Century to the Information Age of the 21st Century, there has been a convergence ICT with the market and government. The result is that the commerce sector, through the impact of a number of interlinked forces, has become e- commerce, and at the same time has become globalized and more value oriented. The same is true of sectors such as manufacturing, agriculture, finance, education, health and even governance. The result of this conver- gence has been the facilitating of an open economy and promotion of a competitive market environment; the creation of new businesses and/or development opportunities; and the enhancement of productivity and effi- ciency in existing sectors and industries. Along with the traditional economy, there is now the ICT (Network) Economy. Keywords for this new economy include network externality, path-dependency (lock-in), increasing returns (positive feedback) and criti- cal mass. These keywords both characterize and dictate the success of ICT. In terms of rural development ICT can play an important role in improving the quality of life for rural people. However, that promise has yet to be realized due to the lack of connectivity and accessibility to universalEconomic analysis of community e-centres for rural development 82services and markets among rural communities. Therefore, it is necessary to remove the impediments faced by the developing rural economy and provide basic infrastructure in rural areas to enable the spread of ICT. This would enable ICT to be part of a comprehensive socio-economic development strategy for rural development as a means, not an end. In rural areas, CeC's are a crucial element and key instrument in efforts to bridge the digital divide. CeCs can be defined as shared premiseswhere the public can use basic telecommunications services, access theInternet and utilize ICT applications for their interests. Its functions include increasing accessibility to basic telecommunication services such as tele- phone, fax; expanding access to universal services such as education,health, government and social services through ICT connectivity; andproviding information and services for the commercial interest of thecommunity through ICT connectivity. Whilst CeCs hold much potential, sustainability is a serious chal- lenge. This is due to a lack of self-sustainability mechanisms; CeCs'inevitable reliance on the public supports; and \"high uncertainty in demandand complementary factors\". Given the high uncertainty in demand, flexible investment planning and a strategic decision-making process is needed for CeC establishment and management. Further, comprehensive economic analysis is needed to increase the value of investment by increasing flexibility in the decision-making process. Key elements in designing a sustainable CeC model The major elements required for economic analysis of CeCs in order to design a sustainable CeC model include the analysis of local demand, the supply condition, and the demographic characteristics of the area. Inaddition, the economic impact of CeCs can be affected by the existenceand intensity of a range of complementary factors that support the socio-economic transformation of rural communities into the one that able tomeet the demands of the information age. The supply condition refers to the potential network, terminal, and application options. A local demand analysis must be conducted first to select the optimal mix of those three options. Based on the local demand analysis, the expected impact of a CeC can be measured, including quantitative andqualitative; direct and indirect; and short-term and long-term impact. Generally, for rural economies much higher investment and operating costs are required for utilizing broadband connection. This is caused by thedifficulty of accessibility to backbone infrastructure and despite rapiddevelopments in wireless technology and PLC technology, it still remainsas one of the greatest physical hurdles in designing CeC's investment plans.One way to address this is to expand the broadband infrastructure based on the demands and readiness of rural communities.Economic analysis of community e-centres for rural development 83The difficulty in using this approach is that it is much more difficult to judge what the estimated revenue from several ICT applications might be in rural communities as there is much higher uncertainty in local demand. Compared to urban communities where potential consumers can be relatively easily captured, users in rural areas have often never sat down in front of a computer before, know little about traditional information search methods (perhaps owing to a lack of rural libraries), have little schooling, and have no experience using the Internet or e-mail. To offset the risk caused by this high uncertainty, CeC investment and management planning should be more flexible. Flexibility is the mechanism by which an alternative route to success can be obtained should the preferred route fail because of a risk. Flexibility therefore, implies the potential of bringing a benefit to a project and increasing its value. The more flexible an investment is, the more the management of a project can take advantage of a beneficial event and offset an adverse event. The value created by flexibility is turned into a real financial benefit, thus resulting in stronger sustainability. The real options valuation approach (ROV A) The real options valuation approach (ROVA) is an emerging economic analysis tool, which challenges traditional approaches such as discounted cash flow method and decision-tree analysis. The objective of a traditional economic analysis is to assess the impact of a project on the local, regional or national economy to see if the investment of the project can be justified in terms of economic net present value (NPV) or internal rate of return (IRR) using the discounted cash flow method. This is done by defining the project objectives and rationale; forecasting demand for the project output; choosing the least-cost design or alternative to meet project demands; quantifying economic benefits and costs by NPV or IRR; and establishing that a project will be sustainable in financial, environmental or social terms over its operating life if the economic NPV is positive or IRR exceeds the minimum hurdle rate. These traditional methods tend to undervalue investment opportunities due to the basic assumption that the investment opportunity is not totally reversible or is a now-or-never opportunity. Therefore, one of their major limitations is that they do not consider the flexibility of the investment, such as altering the pace of investment, or stopping investment at some point if conditions are unfavourable without revisiting the issue of uncertainty and risk reduction. This kind of single-point decision process obviously raises the cost of projects that turn out to be failures. The real options approach, on the other hand, can incorporate such flexibility into its decision process as a monetary term and suggest ways to increase the value of flexibility given high uncertainty to make a strategic and forward-looking investment. Real options can be defined as the right to get the payoff from the business or organization's investment decision on real assets. It is a contingent claim on value, which is dependent on uncertain future demand and/or uncertain output volume. It is not only a valuation tool but a way of thinking.Economic analysis of community e-centres for rural development 84The real options methodology emerged from the theory of financial option pricing (table 1).15 Application of real options includes design, evaluation and optimal timing analysis of project or investment plans innatural resources development projects, real estate, manufacturing and infra-structure investments and R&D projects.

For example, the establish- ment of a CeC can be viewed as an initial investment for increasing the e-awareness of local communities, creating a variety of follow-on commercialand social development opportunities in the future. In this sense, investmentin CeC can be regarded as a real growth option, call-like type, on futuredevelopment and commercial impact (figure 14). How to design a sustainable CeC model The procedure for designing a sustainable CeC model is: (1) demand analysis and impact measurement; (2) technological feasibility study and costestimation; (3) complementary factor analysis; (4) business model design; and(5) pilot test and feedback. In the analysis, the rural economy is divided intofarming and non-farming economies, where the latter includes service, trade,and household manufacturing activities except for the farming activities. These activities depend to a large extent on local and regional demand and tend to grow rapidly in the context of agricultural growth. 15Black and Scholes (1973) and Merton (1973)Economic analysis of community e-centres for rural development 85The characteristics of the CeC investment process include: 1.Staged investment : providing telecentres and training, computer centres, network centres, e-service centres; 2.Uncertain outcome : Different outcomes for different regions depending on the associated idiosyncrasies; and 3. Possibility of changes in decision. It is suitable for the ROVM framework (e.g. no further investment or change to alternative form of investment if negligible expected outcome from the earlier stage investment).

For multiple projects, the key point for institutionalization is estab-lishing the staircase for successful projects to develop further with larger investment. The SBIR (Small Business Innovation Research) Programme in the United States is a good example of this. Sustainability is the most critical issue in establishing, managing, and operating CeCs. In this sense, a new economic analysis paradigm suchas the real options valuation approach enables CeC policy makers or operators to enhance its sustainability by creating more options (or opportu- nities) through stage-wise investment, comprehensive periodic reviews, vari-ous e-applications provisions and strengthening of complementary factors. O. Local knowledge management through community e-centres Mr. Sahdev Singh and Mr. Dilip Shinde, Asian Institute of Technology, Bangkok Introduction Local knowledge is knowledge held locally, held by local people. This may appear straightforward, but it is actually more complex than it seems. The focus is on two aspects of local knowledge: \"formal informa- tion\" (i.e. information written following the tradition of scientific method) about a local situation (e.g. epidemiological information about the health of a defined community, and local journal literature), and \"indigenous\" knowl- edge, or knowledge that is imbedded in local traditions, stories, and other repositories of local wisdom. This presentation explores how to combine and integrate such \"local\" knowledge with \"global\" knowledge to facilitate the actions of health workers and managers at the community level. Particular emphasis is given to the role of information and communication technologies (ICTs), specifically the Internet, in this endeavour. Knowledge is the product of many minds, spread over generations and geographical areas, being added to or adapted as it develops over time. Many indigenous practices are spread across a number of countries, or regions, or even parts of the globe, and it is hard to tell where these practices are really local, and where they have been imported. Equally, with the increasing travel and emergence of diasporas, the phenomenon of \"globalization\" 16 has arisen, where local practices travel 16Riggs, F. W. (1999). Globalization, Diasporas and Area Studies: A Think Piece . Updated: 13 October 1999 http://webdata.soc.hawaii.edu/FredR/glocal.htmLocal knowledge management through community e-centres 87with the movements of the labour force or refugees to very distant places, where they may be shared by expatriate communities, modified and thenre-imported to the mother country. Beyond that is the distinction between local formal knowledge - such as locally published books and journals, locally generated epidemiologicalinformation and medical patient records - and local indigenous knowledge,which embraces local customs and practices, often in oral or other traditionalforms of expression, including storytelling, song, theatre and dance (table 2).

Global-local knowledge matrix Knowledge that is generated locally increasingly comes into contact with, and is influenced by, externally produced knowledge. Such external knowledge is provided in journals, through radio and television and, more recently, electronic media such as CD-ROMs and the Internet. This external knowledge can be either: Of generic relevance (clearinghouse information, standards and norms from such bodies as WHO) Knowledge that refers to the local health situation (papers andreports about, or directly relevant to, the local situation, but produced externally). In practice, such external knowledge can be seen as an extension of local knowledge, even though it was created outside the country or region Finally, there is the category of information produced by othercountries and locations in the region, which is likely to be of relevance locally, given some adaptationLocal knowledge management through community e-centres 88Local knowledge may originate locally, be recognized as relevant and collected for dissemination - written up, drawn or photographed, recorded orfilmed - and then transmitted to others. Equally, knowledge can originate elsewhere and be transmitted to the local setting on paper or electronically. Once it arrives, it may be localized (adapted to make it locally appropriate). Local non-formal or indigenous knowledge According to the World Bank, indigenous knowledge (IK) is simply, \"local knowledge\" which is unique to every culture or society and which serves as the basis for local-level decision-making in agriculture, health care, food preparation, education, natural resource management and a hostof other activities in communities. The World Bank 17 believes IK is important because firstly, it pro- vides problem-solving strategies for local communities, especially the poor. It represents an important component of global knowledge on developmentissues. Secondly, indigenous knowledge is an under-utilized resource in the development process. Increasingly, local knowledge is being collected into digital reposito- ries. The effect of such collection is both to help preserve the knowledge andto spread it more widely. By collecting indigenous knowledge in databases and applying the techniques of comparative analysis and scientific method, the value of such knowledge is coming to be appreciated more widely. Thissometimes has unwelcome consequences - when, for example, a foreigncompany attempts to obtain a patent for an item of indigenous knowledge. For example, there have been battles fought over patents granted to some foreign companies for medicinal uses of leaves from the neem tree, which grows in many parts of South Asia - even though such medicinal uses have been known in the traditional culture for over a thousand years. Examples of Western science methods used to assess IK The following are some examples of Western science methods that could be used to assess IK. This list shows that approaches developed indifferent disciplines can be used. These methods should be combined with insiders' assessment. Animal production and healthcare If a community wishes to expand and improve its livestock produc- tion system, the following Western science methods could determine theefficiency of local animal production and healthcare practices and indicate which aspects of the indigenous system could be used, improved, or blended with Western practices: Measure productivity of animals, recording both inputs and outputs 17World Bank. The IK Initiative at a Glance , (World Bank: http://www.worldbank.org/ afr/ik/broch.pdf )Local knowledge management through community e-centres 89Observe the condition of livestock kept in the community (this could be done by visual inspection, weighing and measuring animals, etc.) Test for parasites by investigating faeces of randomly selectedanimals (this will require some laboratory tests) Identify medicinal plants used by the community and test theirefficacy. The medicinal qualities of some plants have already been established in the scientific literature Indigenous paper making Calculate amount of raw materials and energy used in the production process Test quality of paper in the laboratory (do not forget to keep thelocal use in mind when making any statement about the paper'squality) Effect of IK on environment Assess biodiversity in the environment of the study community (e.g. count number of species in an area of a certain size) Measure nutrients in soil Measure runoff and soil erosion from fields Indigenous birth attendants Collect data about course and outcome of deliveries assisted by indigenous birth attendants and analyze results using statistics Investigate condition of instruments used by local birth atten- dants (e.g. whether the instruments are clean, which bacteria they contain, etc.) Indigenous communication Assess number of persons reached by messages transmitted through indigenous channels Measure time needed for transmission Knowledge management and the field of development Contemporary development debate centres on the over-arching issue of \"globalization\" - the idea that the global economy either is, or should be, orshould not be, global in scope. With the global economy comes a host ofother global issues - global culture, global standards, global legislation,global development - and global knowledge. There are many aspects to this debate. Suffice it to say that many people believe that globalization can be destructive to local economies, cultures and environments. Addressing the Global Knowledge II Conference via a video link, World Bank President James Wolfensohn said, \"Knowledge is perhaps the only unquestioned value of globalization\". Even that may have been over-optimistic, as the relationship between local and global information remainsto be fully clarified.Local knowledge management through community e-centres 90To introduce this topic, the work of two key exponents of \"localiza- tion\" - Stiglitz18 and Hines19 - is summarized below. The end-users Who are the end-users of locally relevant knowledge? The categori- zation of target audiences for health information as an example presentedbelow was drafted at a meeting held at WHO's Eastern MediterraneanRegional Office 20: 1. Policy-making levels in the Ministry of Health 2. Health professionals with university training3. Health professionals with full, normal training but not university4. Policy-making levels in the government5. Professionals in health-related fields with university training (managers, accountants, nutritionists, etc.) 6. Technicians in various fields7. Paramedics, health technicians8. Health auxiliaries9. Traditional birth attendants and traditional healers10. Other auxiliary staff, community workers and local NGOs 11. Community leaders (religious, social leaders, teachers, etc.) 12. Public opinion leaders (including social writers)13. The general public, educated (secondary school level and upwards)14. The general public (including village communities, etc.) The breadth of this classification is worth noting - from politicians and civil servants, academics and researchers, to practitioners at all levelsin the public health infrastructure (from central services to community-based services) and right down to the general public. Each group requires information and knowledge tailored to its needs. This is true throughout the world, and is a particularly significant issue indeveloping countries. Knowledge integration The key question is how to bring together global and local knowl- edge, and \"expert\" and indigenous knowledge. 18Stiglitz, J.

Available at http://www.inesglobal.org/hines.html 20Adapted from: World Health Organization, Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office, Cairo, Egypt, unpublished report EM/PUB DOC/4, 1984Local knowledge management through community e-centres 91A number of initiatives are working on this, some focusing on bringing external information into the local sphere and adapting it to make it locally appropriate. Others are strengthening the capability of local information to be recognized and operate locally and to participate in theinternational flow of information. Still others focus on making huge collec- tions of formal health information available. Some of these will be de- scribed below. Information waystations and staging posts: electronic-print chaining The information waystations and staging posts activity provides a number of examples of how knowledge networking can be applied in formulating large collaborative projects. From 1998, INASP-Health hasmanaged the Health Information Forum (HIF), a regular series of meetings bringing together many organizations interested in health information. Right from the start, HIF participants considered technological options for gettinghealth information to health workers in developing countries. The challenge was to develop a coherent, cost-effective approach. An e-mail list was used to extend the discussion as widely as possible (over 2,000 messages weresent), and gradually two concepts arose: Information waystations : local points of access to health infor- mation received electronically Staging posts : \"relay stations\", translating and adapting informa- tion materials in order to make them locally appropriate Thus, information waystations are concerned with bringing the tech- nology to developing countries and training people to use it to obtain health information, while staging posts focus on adapting the information materials received in such a way as to make them more appropriate for local use. The open knowledge network: local content creation and exchange The Open Knowledge Network (OKN) arose from work done by the G8 DOT force between 2000 and 2002. Representatives from government, civil society and the private sector in both developed and developing countries worked on a wide range of initiatives to help bring digital opportunities to the South. Among these initiatives, the creation and exchange of local content was identified as a keystone in any bridge across the digital divide. Without appropriate local content, users could arrive at community access points only to find little of relevance to their lives, almost nothing in their own language and few ways to use this new technology to increase their chance of an improved livelihood. The Genoa Plan of Action therefore called for a \"national and international effort to support local content and applications creation\" that would in particular: 1. Encourage networking among bodies which acquire, adapt and distribute content on a non-commercial basis;Local knowledge management through community e-centres 922. Encourage governments to provide widely-available free-of- charge access to state-owned information and local content,except where it is private or classified; and 3. Encourage commercial publishers to explore possible business models to enhance greater accessibility for poor people torelevant content 21. The consultation process began under the chairmanship of OneWorld International (the civil society DOT force delegate from the UK) withsupport from the Department of International Development (DFID) in theUK. What emerged from six months of consultation and research intoexisting best practice was a proposal that came to be called the \"OpenKnowledge Network\" (OKN). The purpose of the OKN is to promote boththe creation and the exchange of local content as widely as possible acrossthe South. Local content development is closely tied to human develop-ment, and the ultimate goal of the OKN proposal is the empowerment oflocal communities. The following key concepts are included in OKN: Connect to the Internet without going online, using local public access points/CeCs to upload or download information in short,inexpensive bursts Focus on content, not technology, which is always changing.The forms best adapted to one Southern context may be inap-propriate in another Agree on using standards for exchanging digital content world-wide Network knowledge workers and translators across the South Use a network of knowledge hubs to support the local access points Encourage circulation of works that are affordable by Southernusers, while still allowing such users to profit from their owncontributions to the knowledge base. This will require an OpenKnowledge License for proprietary material, which will includethe rights to copy, modify and translate information, to offer it for public distribution among members of the OKN network, and to circulate it further in non-digital formats such as hardcopies, radio broadcasts and community bulletin boards Encourage a market for local information, while maintaining theprinciple that knowledge for development should, wherever pos-sible, be free at the point of use in poor communities 21OKN (Open Knowledge Network). 2002.

Harmonizing ICT with integrated community development: the Sarvodaya experience in Sri Lanka Mr. Vinya S. Ariyaratne, Executive Director, Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement The Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement of Sri Lanka started in 1958 when a high school teacher, A.T. Ariyaratne, took his class and some fellowteachers to one of the poorest outcast villages in the country. 22 Their goal was to live, work, learn and share their youthful energy in service. Now in 15,000 rural villages, this people's self-help movement integrates cultural, social, spiritual and economic development. Sarvodayaserves as a model and inspiration for similar programmes and movementsthroughout the world. The movement's vision is the creation of a societywithout poverty or affluence based on the Gandhian values of truth, non-violence and self-reliance. Rooted in indigenous cultural and religioustraditions, Sarvodaya villages are governed by the ideals of participatorydemocracy. The hallmark of the Sarvodaya Movement is its \"bottom up\" approach. Organized through village-level groups of farmers, women, children, youthand elders, a five-stage development model includes leadership training,technical assistance and ongoing organizational support provided through anetwork of 34 district centres, backed by a secretariat at the Sarvodayaheadquarters in Moratuwa, on the outskirts of Colombo, Sri Lanka. After nearly five decades, the Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement engages nearly a half of the rural communities of Sri Lanka in social,economic and technological empowerment. Throughout changes in thenational government, violent ethnic and political conflict, and rapidlychanging international pressures, Sarvodaya has served as a source ofstability and peace. It offers models of integrated development useful tocultures around the world, including \"high tech\" societies as well asdeveloping countries.This presentation outlines how this unique people'sdevelopment movement in Sri Lanka uses information and communicationtechnology (ICT) as a \"tool for the awakening of communities\". Status of ICT in Sri Lanka The introduction of ICT has not only been slow in Sri Lanka, but it has also been concentrated in the urban centres. However, the very highliteracy rate amongst its population and the presence of large numbers ofunemployed youth provided an opportunity to use the potential of ICT forsocial development in Sri Lanka. Despite significant advances in the 22http:/www.Sarvodaya.lkHarmonizing ICT with integrated community development: the Sarvodaya experience in Sri Lanka 94telecommunications sector, it is evident that up until recently there was no organized mechanism to promote interaction with the rural communitiesthrough IT for their self development. A recent pilot study carried out by the Department of Census and Statistics in Sri Lanka 23 revealed that the percentage of households owning computers in Sri Lanka is 3.8 with a large proportion confined to theWestern Province and the district of Colombo. An estimation of computer literacy of the household population in the age group 5-69 years was also assessed as part of this study. At thenational level, 10 per cent of the above population is computer literate.Western Province reported the highest computer literacy rate of 15.3 percent, and the lowest percentage of five per cent was reported from Uva andNorth Central provinces (figure 16). Figure 16. Computer literacy in Sri Lanka by province The highest computer literacy rate of 20 per cent was reported from the Colombo district. Over 10 per cent literacy rates were reported fromGampaha, Kalutara, Kandy and Matara districts. The Monaragala districtreported the lowest computer literacy rate of three per cent. It is therefore very clear that an overwhelming majority of the rural communities in Sri Lanka, which comprise over 70 per cent of the totalpopulation, do not presently have access to the benefits of ICT. 23(2004). Computer Literacy of Sri Lanka: 2004, A Pilot Study , (Colombo, Department of Census and Statistics).Harmonizing ICT with integrated community development: the Sarvodaya experience in Sri Lanka 95A comprehensive report by the UNDP (2004) also highlighted the importance of involving the rural sector in ICT development in Sri Lanka.24 The flagship ICT programme of the Government of Sri Lanka, known asthe e-Sri Lanka initiative, was launched in 2002. 25 The ICT programme of Sarvodaya has therefore focused on the rural areas of Sri Lanka, and has adopted an integrated approach to introducingICT which is described in this presentation. ICT in Sarvodaya The Sarvodaya Movement was quick to perceive the widening of the gap between the information rich and the information poor. Therefore, the concept of Multipurpose Community Telecentres (MCT) concept was born. Multi-purpose community telecentres 26 Each MCT has its own unique qualities, yet all share a commitment to technology access and a belief that a MCT can be a means forparticipants to increase their self-sufficiency. A successful MCT model offers opportunities to improve education levels, gain job-related skills, and build personal and community capacity. It can offer a place where partici-pants gather together and link with the entire community. An important criterion for success is the degree to which the MCT becomes an integral part of its community. Participants can and should take part in the planningprocess and have a real role in directing and sustaining center operations. Rural regions face special challenges when they try to adopt informa- tion and communication technology. A rural community technology centre is a central location within a rural community or region equipped with computer and telecommunication equipment and services shared by users from a varietyof sectors. For Sri Lanka, the MCT was a new concept with considerable promise for facilitating the use of these technologies. It was hoped that, given the various provisions made in the MCT concept, the pilot phase in the late1990s would not only lead to full ownership, but also help identify self-reliant and self-sustaining management/operations models. Sarvodaya telecentres - the beginnings The \"ICT for Community Development\" programme of Sarvodaya was formally launched in 1998 as a pilot project to set up a rural MCT in the district of Ratnapura, located 110 miles away from the capital cityColombo. This small experiment has today grown into a multifaceted 24United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) (2004). Promoting ICT for Human Development in Asia 2004, Realizing the Millennium Development Goals, Sri Lanka,Regional Human Development Report , (Colombo, UNDP). 25http://www.esrilanka.lk 26Community telecentre is often used to community e-centre.Harmonizing ICT with integrated community development: the Sarvodaya experience in Sri Lanka 96comprehensive rural IT programme which is operational in seven out of the 25 administrative districts of Sri Lanka. These rural MCT allow the Sarvodaya staff members and volunteers to add new dimensions to their conventional development activities. Ini- tially they used the facility for word processing of reports, graphic illustra- tions of village maps, and PowerPoint presentations to educate groups of village residents. Now, the MCT have opened up an extensive array of village development-oriented activities ranging from leadership training, biodiversity conservation and better access to market prices and jobs. At a typical district MCT, people feel at home because it does not stress \"high technology\" as much as real problem solving. A computer, photocopier, fax machine and telephone sit in a tiny room without air conditioning, for a reason - if rural youth had to push the door open to enter, they would feel less welcome. At the centre, they meet young people like themselves who communicate through body language and local termi- nology instead of strict \"computer-talk.\" With help, village youth who have never touched a keyboard or made a phone call can contact a hospital in the city. They can send a fax to the Government office that serves them or e-mail a message to a family member working in the Middle East. It was not easy, however, to identify the best strategies to introduce ICT to rural areas. Anyone visiting the countryside can recognize the daunting obstacles. Despite the high literacy levels countrywide, as de- scribed earlier, computer literacy is extremely low. Even if utilities are available, buying a computer is still beyond the imagination for many Sri Lankans, given the high cost of computer equipment and often unreliable telecommunications. Monthly incomes are barely sufficient to meet basic daily needs. Despite such barriers, social mobilization has found a new life in this Sarvodaya Telecentre experiment. It allows users to bypass geographic and socio-economic barriers with two-way communication compatible with participatory development. Village information circles (VICs) Although the MCT function at the district level at present (the \"T\" in ICT), the foundation for the centre (the \"I\" of ICT) in terms of information generation and use is the village and it is the primary unit of all Sarvodaya development activities. This is facilitated by the Village Information Circle (VIC). VICs are identified as key components for organizing villages to- ward these opportunities. They have become an integral part of existingvillage societies where people get together to think, act and take decisionscollectively. Once it is coupled with other ongoing village developmentactivities such as pre-school education, nutrition, community health, micro-Harmonizing ICT with integrated community development: the Sarvodaya experience in Sri Lanka 97credit and enterprise development, IT leads to a uniquely appropriate information culture within the village. The core values of Sarvodayapermeate each step in the process. Ironically, the most important element is not necessarily the elec- tronic superhighway but rather young people who are living miles away from the MCT. Originally called \"human interfaces,\" they are energeticyouth from the local community itself. In keeping with Sarvodaya's inte- grated village development philosophy, they are not automatically given extensive computer training. Instead they are given a chance to learn aboutthe benefits of ICTs by serving as bridges between their families, neighbours and peers, the world of Sarvodaya and beyond. The current status of MCT Initially, five district centres were chosen to pilot test the usefulness of ICT in the context of village development. To date, several sites have been established through support received from the Novartis Foundation ofSwitzerland and the Nippon Foundation of Japan. Since 1998, the first MCT at Ratnapura has served as a learning site to establish the foundations for expansion nationwide. Through this pilot programme, villagers wereable to obtain access to the following information and services: Information on markets, banking and education, technical assis- tance for economic development Communication via e-mail to other villages, districts, programmes and with relatives abroad Production and presentation of education and training materials,publications, curriculum aids, promotional literature Hands-on training for young people and adults interested in computers and technology-related employment Ratnapura's MCT has attracted a cadre of youth whose high motiva- tion and enthusiasm have enabled them to serve as \"human interfaces\" for the rest of the community. They have become the bridge over the divide between high and low technology; the often overwhelming virtual wealth ofthe Internet and the reality of daily living in rural Sri Lanka. Service to villages is carried out through \"person power\" despite the lack of sophisticated technology. It is precisely that human interface, however, that Sarvodaya can count upon to serve as a bridge between theneeds of villagers and the information resources of the world around them in Sri Lanka and abroad. Telecommunications and distance education can provide opportunities for outreach that works both ways, sharing theindigenous knowledge of rural Sri Lankans with their peers throughout the nation, and offering skill-building in collaboration with other educational institutions and NGOs.Harmonizing ICT with integrated community development: the Sarvodaya experience in Sri Lanka 98Lessons learned The main objective of the Sarvodaya ICT programme was to pro- mote, through the centre, connectivity, access, capacity-building and content creation. Ideally, it was intended to lead to the emergence of a network of knowledge communities linking Sri Lankan villages. Within this overall context, the ICT programme of Sarvodaya has: 1. Successfully demonstrated the feasibility of, and gained experi- ence with, the operation of MCTs as a national modality to provide telephone and consequently Internet connectivity to un-der-serviced communities in rural districts. 2. Provided access to communication networks, information, data and knowledge for unconnected and under-serviced communitiesand made possible avenues for other customers (e.g. NGOs, civil society organizations, private businesses - as a possible income source for sustainability). 3. Assisted in the building of the following needed capacities in the context of the centre programme: Reinforced institutional capacity to manage the centre's sub- programme and enabled the communities to directly link with national programmes such as e-Sri Lanka programme through VGKs (Vishva Gnana Kendra) Provided managerial (including financial and accounting), technical and maintenance skills for staff selected to manage and operate MCTs, with an emphasis on the training-of-trainers approach (at the central and district levels) Contributed to broadening computer literacy at the commu-nity level Introduced e-mail and networking skills and tools, including discussion groups, virtual conferences/list-servers at the com- munity level Imparted Internet usage and browsing skills at the commu- nity level Tested training for the creation and management of Web sites at the community level. 4. Worked in a participatory approach with Sarvodaya village groups and other intended beneficiaries so as to raise awarenessabout the objectives and possibilities of the centres, to developthe operations and scope of the centres, to design knowledgeaccess and management strategies, to assess the acceptance bythe intended beneficiaries and to refine in an ongoing manner user/access guidelines. 5. Contributed towards empowering youth and women's groups through the acquisition of ICT skills, such as computer, e-mail and Internet usage, networking and content creation and specifically, to support Sarvodaya in fulfilling its mandate and remit, enhancing itsHarmonizing ICT with integrated community development: the Sarvodaya experience in Sri Lanka 99capacity to contribute more effectively to a broad-based national dialogue, including remote areas, and various decision-making processes requiring input of community groups' views. 6. Laid the groundwork to create and provide access to content in local languages, in the framework for the centres and the services offered by them, thereby promoting the emergence ofnew livelihoods and employment. 7. Developed curricula, information, programmes and other material for a number of social development-related applications, envi-ronment, education, health, promotion of electronic commerce and support to small, medium-sized and micro-credit enterprises. 8. Developed a basis for evaluations to assess the extent to which centres actually help to empower members of the community, create employment and livelihoods, engender or enhance partici- patory activities and promote national as well as internationalnetworking. Finally, through the activities of the pilot MCTs it was realized that effective management of information requires professionals who understand information and how it is created, organized, sought and used by people in both their work lives and their personal lives. One of the most importantactivities in an Information Society is to maintain a cadre of qualified information personnel. Future prospects Expansion and consolidation With the experience gained so far, Sarvodaya has now established new partnerships with several international agencies to further expand, improve and consolidate its ICT programme. The most recent partnership is with the Microsoft Corporation which provided a grant of Rs.13 million to Sarvodaya as part of the company's third round of Unlimited Potential (UP) 27 grants to recipients around the world. This will help to improve Sarvodaya's centre network to provide increased access to rural underserved communities. Through the Microsoft UP grant, Sarvodaya will be able to expand the facilities to 12 district MCTs. These centres will serve the communitiesand help to provide basic computing courses that can enable rural youth topursue new job opportunities and contribute fully to their local communi-ties and to the country at large. The grant will also facilitate 240 scholar-ships for village youth from underserved areas to acquire basic computerskills. A fully equipped and staffed Multipurpose Community Telecentre 27http://www.microsoft.com/mscorp/citizenship/overview/uprecipients.asp.Harmonizing ICT with integrated community development: the Sarvodaya experience in Sri Lanka 100will also be established in the North-east to carry out training in the former conflict areas. Through this expansion, the telecentres will provide scholar-ships in computer training to students and those out of school over the nexttwo years. This in turn will provide nearly 2,000 young people with newskills and open doors to a new future. The programme supported by Microsoft will directly create new opportunities for 2,400 youth and adults in 480 villages in the country's 12districts, and indirectly for 48,000 village people per annum. Theprogramme will outreach to nearly 200,000 people indirectly through thepromotion of info-culture at grassroots. Research on the use of WiFi technology at the village level Sarvodaya has partnered with the IDRC to develop a pilot project to initiate two virtual villages , in which the potential of ICT will be harmo- nized with the traditions and the development of the rural community. It isplanned to be based upon the ongoing Sarvodaya MCT programme. Thepresent project will develop an extension to two selected centres, toestablish two \"Virtual Villages\" equipped with wireless technology whichwill further develop the use of ICT for development within a traditional village environment. Two \"tele-huts\" will be established in each village neighbouring the \"village-community-bank\"/CBO office (community based organization), andwill be networked (externally) to the district centres. Wireless networks willbe established in each village (internally), networking village access points;three \"static\" ICT points at a temple, school, and ayurvedic practitioner andtwo \"mobile\" ICT points, which will provide access to women, farmers and entrepreneurs. The ICT network will be made functional as a supporting mechanism for the ongoing community development work. Two leading academic institutions in Sri Lanka - the School of Computing of the University of Colombo (UCSC) and the Faculty ofAgriculture of the University of Peradeniya - and a leading women's research organization - CENWOR - will be collaborating partners in this pioneering applied research programme which will investigate through two academic research protocols; ICT technological aspects and socio-anthropo-logical aspects, based on the performances of the two virtual villages. Thetechnology research team will concentrate on the aspects of adaptability ofnetworking technologies to the rural environment, adaptability of opensource technologies and technological bottle-necks. The socio-anthropologi- cal research team will study the aspect of response patterns of diverse community groups including gender, behavioural changes and impact madeby ICT on community life. The replicability and sustainability of the projectconcept will also be evaluated. The research findings of this two-year projectwill be made available to the policy makers and development workers.Harmonizing ICT with integrated community development: the Sarvodaya experience in Sri Lanka 101Conclusion ICT has tremendous potential to help improve living conditions of a large segment of impoverished communities in Sri Lanka. The high literacyrate, the availability of skilled ICT personnel, strong government commitment,vibrant civil society actors and more importantly the enthusiasm of villagepeople, especially of the youth, to experiment and innovate through ICT, areall ingredients which could be positively harnessed for effective use of ICT fordevelopment. The ongoing MCT programme of Sarvodaya is a model of thesuccessful use of ICT as a tool for community awakening. Q. Conducive environments for promoting community e-centres Mr. Jonathan Kushner, Global Strategic Accounts Executive, Microsoft Corporation and Mr. Peter Chong, Corporate Attorney, Far East Region, Microsoft Law and Corporate Affairs Key public policy challenges Bridging the Digital Divide in terms of race, gender, age, income, and location is one of the busiest challenges facing governments and policymakers today. Factors that contribute and exacerbate this divide include: Geographic : terrain, distance and infrastructure Economic : ICT infrastructure remains cost-prohibitive for many communities and nations Technological : Increasing skills required to participate in the ICT economy Cultural : Inequalities in access and participation Political: Long-term investments versus short-term political cycle Sensible and well implemented public policy can do much to bridge the gap between the information \"haves\" and \"have-nots.\" By introducing policiesand incentives to encourage the acceleration of broadband deployment,increasing research and development (R&D) investment, embracing \"AnyTime, Anywhere\" learning, developing a world-class digital workforce,updating legal and regulatory systems, and ensuring that the political will isthere to support these initiatives. ICT can play an integral role in supportingeconomic development in developing countries, regions and communities. To achieve this, a conducive and enabling environment is needed. The key characteristics of such an environment include: Pro-innovation policy environment: support for market liberal- ization; supportive investment and tax policy and a regulatoryframework Secure online environment: this includes network security, encryption and privacy in place to protect digital commerce andprotections for Intellectual PropertyConducive environments for promoting community e-centres 10221st century e-government vision and infrastructure : what approach to take depends on a nation's stage of developmentand resources available, but should encourage public-private partnerships, and should be implemented at municipal, regional, national and supranational levels Market liberalization is the key to the growth of the ICT sector. It is important therefore to promote market access for private as well asgovernment telecom service suppliers through deregulation. Deregulation can promote competition, lower costs and improve quality of service - particu- larly in telecoms. Studies have shown a positive link between deregulationand ICT usage. As part of market liberalization, fixed line and mobilesectors should be liberalized and more spectrum should be allocated forwireless broadband devices. Fast and affordable broadband access should beavailable to allow citizens, businesses and governments to connect over the public networks. Encouraging multiple providers can help to make broad- band more affordable and accessible, creating a situation where ultimately,end-users have unfettered access to Internet content and applications. Business environment Hand-in-hand with market investment, private and government in- vestment in infrastructure and innovation is also needed. Pro-innovationbusiness polices are beneficial as they promote connectivity by encouragingnew businesses. Examples of policies include minimizing business regula-tions; offering tax breaks for initial start-up years; providing governmentseed money for rural IT projects; promoting rural banking and micro-creditfor entrepreneurs; and removing cultural roadblocks to entrepreneurship. Other ways to stimulate new business include encouragement to private investment and R&D in new generation technologies by providing tax creditsand other incentives and through good governance. Good governanceencourages business investment in ICT by reassuring investors that domesticlaws and policies are administered in a transparent and fair manner. Local economic development Microsoft's Economic IT Development Programme is a comprehen- sive framework that incorporates relevant programmes, Microsoft's technol-ogy vision, and opportunities for Microsoft's partners that are executableand measurable. The benefits to partners of this programme include: Help government policy makers to understand Microsoft's con-tribution to the local software ecosystem Allow policy makers to identify new areas for cooperation andpartnership Provide government decision makers with data about the impactof the commercial software industry and the local ISV commu-nity to help shape policy decisions The programme elements are aligned with national IT and economic development policy priorities to provide an integrated and locally appropri-ate approach.Conducive environments for promoting community e-centres 103Pro-competitive regulatory environment The elements of a pro-competitive regulatory environment include that it should be industry-led, voluntary open standards, be based on merit- based procurement, have no preferences for specific technology solutions or platforms, provide technology neutrality funding for research and develop- ment to enable inter-operability. The use of industry-led, voluntary and consensus based open stan- dards promotes inter-operability, interconnection and data exchange which encourages more competition. This allows users, both the private and public sectors, to use a diverse range of IT products and services. Merit-based procurement is performance based and has no prefer- ences for specific technology solutions or platforms. Mandating specific technology can freeze standards at a certain time. Therefore, it is important to have technology neutrality for funding for research and development to enable inter-operability. These should be key components of e-government initiatives as they promote choice, competition and innovation. Digital commerce New technologies have a great deal of potential, but when misused they can threaten national security and public safety, compromise critical information, disrupt vital services and erode trust in computing. Threats to e-commerce from new technologies come in a number of different forms. They can be unstructured threats such as hackers and viruswriters, or they can be structured threats such as \"hacktivists,\" organized crime, \"phishers,\" fraudsters, or professional spammers. Junk e-mail makes up 60 per cent of e-mail content. There has been a significant increase in junk e-mails in recent years - just three years ago it was only three per cent. Of further concern for this region, more and morespam is originating from the Asia Pacific. Fourteen billion spam e-mails are sent every day, with Microsoft blocking three billion spam e-mails every day, as does AOL. The cost of that is enormous in terms of the extra storage spacethat is required to hold all this mail and the bandwidth to transmit it. The cost to business is as much as US$ 20 billion every year, in the form of time wastage in filtering out spam. It is now a more costly problem to businessthan absenteeism. Beyond those costs, there is an alarming convergence between spam and more serious fraud. The real impact is that it leads to an erosion of trust in the overall computing environment. People may stopaccessing the Internet because filtering through spam is becoming too burdensome. Spam is the number one problem for e-mail users, and 29 per cent reduction in using e-mail as a result. One solution to protect against spam in particular is for industry/ companies to build the best possible software to screen spam. Another solution is to share solutions and expertise in beating these Internet threatsConducive environments for promoting community e-centres 104to e-commerce. More generally, governments can dramatically reduce the above problems and protect the online environment, while at the same time encouraging e-commerce through: Technology and training Industry self-regulation Legislation and policy initiatives Enforcement Secure online environment: encryption and authentication Strong encryption improves online security and increases consumer/ citizen confidence, while authentication and electronic contracting allows networks to verify information about users and ascertain whether they havea right to enter the system. E-signatures are one way to authenticate the identity of a user - they should be based on non-discrimination, technology neutrality, and respect for party autonomy. Most countries are committed to providing secure online environ- ment and laws to achieve this have been implemented in many Asia-Pacificjurisdictions: Hong Kong - Electronic Transactions Ordinance (2000) India - Information Technology Act (2000) Japan - Law Concerning Electronic Signatures and CertificationAuthorities (2000) Korea - Basic Law on Electronic Commerce, which covers e- signatures Malaysia - Digital Signatures Bill (1997) Philippines - Electronic Commerce Act (2000) Singapore - Electronic Transactions Act (1998) Thailand - Electronic Commerce Law (2000) Intellectual property (IP) In many countries in the region, trade in physical counterfeit goods, including high-quality product designed to deceive consumers, is highly organized, sophisticated and well-financed, often by global counterfeiting organizations. Recently there has also been an exponential increase in Internet piracy. Therefore, there is a strong need to enforce of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) that will encourage companies to create and innovate. Legislation protecting IPR should aim to protect consumers from illegal goods and achieve cooperation between the private sector and law enforcement to disrupt, deter, and punish major counterfeiters and online pirates. E-government vision All of the above is consistent with the Brunei Goals and e-APEC strategy. In Brunei in 2000, APEC Leaders set out what have become known as the Brunei Goals for access to the Internet - these goals still remain relevant:Conducive environments for promoting community e-centres 105\"We commit to develop and implement a policy framework which will enable the people of urban, provincial and rural communi- ties in every economy to have individual or community-basedaccess to information and services offered via the Internet by 2010...Governments alone cannot achieve this vision. We recog- nize that it will require massive infrastructure development andhuman capacity building, and technologies which are only now in their formative stages. It will require a regime of outward- looking and market-oriented policies which can attract businessinvestment and the cooperation and skills of our universities, training and research institutions, colleges and schools\". The cornerstone of the digital economy To use technology to promote rural ICT development and usage, it is necessary to think about what programmes, technologies and experiences are needed to move rural communities forward on the Information Highway. The role of Government Government has a key role to play in providing services to rural communities. Through government CeCs, the government can bring educa- tion, economic development, health and efficient and secure government torural communities. Education and training - a widening skills gap Education changes lives, families, communities, and, ultimately, na- tions, countries, and territories. Yet, despite real improvements in access to, and use of, information and communication technology (ICT) around the world, many students and teachers still lack basic access to training andtechnology. The result is a widening ICT skills gap that contributes to disparities in quality of life, competitiveness, and economic development. Since launching Partners in Learning in September 2003, Microsoft has worked hard at establishing the groundwork for success of the five-yearinvestment. Working with governments worldwide, Microsoft has created 95 public/private partnerships through MoUs, in 74 countries. Microsoft has started to build an ecosystem for success, by creating partnerships with 563 government, NGOs, education and commercial part- ners, ranging from the World Bank, UNDP, UNESCO, to local universities and training partners. Through the Fresh Start for Donated PCs programme, over 700,000 donated computers have already been re-licensed. But the work has just begun, and it is ultimately the local impact that counts. The followingexample is one story of the local impact of Partners in Learning: Story from Ban Houysalao School (Thailand) Ban Houysalso school in Buriram province (410 km from Bangkok) is one of the schools that participates in Microsoft's Partners in Learninginitiative. Participants in this programme have developed ICT literacy,Conducive environments for promoting community e-centres 106moving from no PCs to now having a small computer lab equipped with the Internet via satellite. Now, the team of teachers and students are working together creating their school's Web page. Previously, many parents transferred their children out of Ban Houysalao to other schools. But now, as a result of the school's computer lab, students from other schools are transferring to Ban Houysalao school. This phenomenon is the result of the changes in the learning environment in the school, based on the Partners in Learning initiative. Following the success of a pilot training programme for 2,000 teachers, official training is now commencing for 50,000 teachers nationwide on basic IT skills. Train- ing will be conducted using a combination of e-learning and instructor-led programmes to better cater to individual learning curves as well as to provide an opportunity for group learning and interaction. There will be a strong focus on real-life examples and experience-based learning to enable more efficient and effective transfer of knowledge and skills learned from teacher to pupils in the classrooms. Microsoft digital inclusion programmes Education creates opportunities and employment options for youth and allows for the renewal of workplace skills to ensure that the labour force is properly prepared to meet the challenges and opportunities that the Information Society presents. Disproportionate investments in, and access to, education invariably results in rising disparities in quality of life and economic development. Microsoft has developed two programmes which is broken down into two categories - what one learn at school, and what one learn outside school. These are two very different needs. The flagship digital inclusion initiatives for Microsoft are its Partners in Learning and Unlimited Poten- tial programmes. Together, the programmes aim to provide IT skills training to 500,000 individuals around the world by the year 2008. Partners in learning Governments need to focus on key issues around digital literacy, creating education and competitive workforces and improving the quality of life for their citizens. These goals can be addressed through focusing on digital inclusion. There are two key issues which must be addressed in order to eliminate the ICT skills gap in schools: access and capacity building. Consequently, the Microsoft Partners in Learning initiative in- cludes three distinct yet integrated core programmes, each of which can be customized and implemented based upon the educational objectives of a country, state or province (figure 17). The programmes are detailed below: 1.Partners in learning grants programme: Over the next five years, these learning grants will provide investments to create a sustainable model for improving the use of technology in teaching and learning. They focus on key issues identified as challenges for schools: teacher/school leader training and development, access toConducive environments for promoting community e-centres 107quality digital content, and assessment and certification resources and low-cost technical support. One area that funding will support is the establishment of local Microsoft IT Academies for Teacher Training through joint partnerships with education institutions, local community organizations, and training providers. 2.Fresh start for donated computers: Donated computers are an economic necessity for educational programmes around theworld as they provide access to technology to students. How-ever, these PCs often lack installed or properly licensed operat-ing systems. To remove this barrier to computer utilization,Fresh Start provides K-12 schools with Microsoft\u00ae Windows\u00ae98 or Windows 2000 licenses for donated PCs at no charge. 3.School agreement subscription licensing programme: To sup- port schools, Microsoft offers academic pricing and provides aneasier way to manage valuable technology resources under theMicrosoft School Agreement. In addition, Partners in Learningoffers eligible 28 primary and secondary schools the opportunity to receive even lower pricing for Microsoft Office XP Profes-sional and Windows XP Professional Upgrade licenses throughthe Microsoft School Agreement. Figure 17. Partners in learning 28The World Bank's Gross National Income (GNI) index was used to establish the criteria for eligibility for reduced prices for Windows XP Professional Upgrade and Office XPProfessional. GNI is an objective measure of wealth that is updated frequently anduniversally accepted by governments and a variety of international funding organiza-tions. The World Bank list of economies by Income Group is available atwww.worldbank.org/data/databytopic/CLASS.XLSConducive environments for promoting community e-centres 108Unlimited potential programme The cornerstone of Microsoft's lifelong learning strategy is much broader - it is called \"Unlimited Potential.\" It is a natural evolution ofMicrosoft's community investments during the past 20 years, which ismuch more focused on a single goal - offering technology-related skillstraining for disadvantaged young people and adults through community- based learning centres. There are already community technology learning centres or CeCs in many cities, towns and villages around the world - Microsoft is partnering with those centres to enhance the IT skills programmes they offer, to help them improve access to that training, and to give them access to thetechnology they need. The goal is to transform even the poorest ruraltechnology centres into community hubs for lifelong learning. Local language programme Local and regional governments around the world are facing a great challenge in today's global economy - the need to quickly build a stronginformation technology industry. Microsoft is committed to providing thetools and technologies required to develop, enhance and expand local IT economies and enable language groups of all sizes to participate in this growth. The Local Language Programme is designed to provide theseopportunities to people of all regions, cultures and languages in closecollaboration with regional and local governments and universities. The Local Language Programme addresses several critical goals of today's national and regional governments: Developing a robust local IT economy Building universal IT solutions for multi-language cultures Enabling the use of regional languages in technology to facili-tate the preservation of language and culture Solutions sharing network One of the key challenges is duplication. To address this, the Solutions Sharing Network (SSN) was launched by Microsoft at the end of 2004. The SSN provides customers with an environment within which they can share and collaboratively build solutions and knowledge alongside theirpeer organizations. The SSN platform is provided to a government agency orassociation as a component of a partnership agreement; under the agreement,Microsoft works with them to encourage wider use of their technology assets. Customer benefits include the provision of a managed and secure mechanism to customers that allows them to leverage their existing invest- ments in IT. Further, as content builds within the online communities, government customers will have a central source for knowledge andsolutions that will help them reduce cost, and reduce the risks associatedwith building ICT systems.Conducive environments for promoting community e-centres 109R. E-health in rural communities through community e-centres Mr. Ashok Jhunjhunwala, Professor, Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, India E-health-care is an electronic healthcare management project in Bihar, founded and managed by a NGO to computerize existing medicalrecords of patients and to provide continuity in treatment by enablingaccess to medical history. The e-health-care model provides villagers with ahealth card at a nominal cost of 10 cents. Using the health card asidentification, a remote physician is then able to access the medical historyof the villager and provide suitable treatment. The health card is theproject's primary revenue stream, with the potential to increase revenuethrough the provision of health insurance. Since its establishment in Bihar,it has expanded to Sirsa, Haryana and now to Madhya Pradesh(Hoshangabad, Harda) in alliance with IBM Canada/BSNL/SaskatchewanTelecom and funding from CIDA. Each location has a server which ispurchased and maintained through grants. The long-term scalability andsustainability of the project is in question as presently the operational cashgap is too high and grants are the primary source of funding. Rural telemedicine projects The Apollo Hospitals project is a pilot project in Aragonda, AP. The project, which was established in a 40-bed fully equipped hospital, wasstarted in 2000. The project provides tele-consultation through a webcam/ISDN/VSAT link with Chennai for \"specialty and super specialty consulta-tions.\" It provided 200 tele-consultations in its first year of operation. Thehospital is linked to health insurance. So far it has undertaken limited scalingup - setting up 70 telemedicine centres, of which around 15 are operational. Another example is the Amrita Telemedicine project, which is connecting Lakshadweep to different hospitals through ISRO (satellite) link.However, this project is not very rural in nature. Overview of telemedicine projects The common thread for most of these projects is the provision of \"specialty\" or \"super specialty\" consultations with experts located in hospi-tals. The projects are generally funded by government or through grants.However, in most, sustainability and scalability is uncertain. Rural India has 700 million people in over 600,000 villages living on a per capita income of 40 cents per day. Can ICT make a significantdifference in the life of such people? Can it bring health and education torural communities, and can it significantly enhance their incomes? If thebenefits of ICT are to make a difference, then the sustainability andscalability of rural health and community projects needs to be improved. Can the efforts scale? To enhance the scalability of rural models, there is a need for technology, a sustainable business model and an organization which thinksand acts \"rural\".E-health in rural communities through community e-centres 110Technology Wireless systems can be used to connect most villages. As technolo- gies continually evolve, costs are coming down and bit rates are increasing.In India, fibre connectivity to most county towns (talukas) is provided bystate-owned incumbents. Fibre has capability for infinite bandwidth - a majorbenefit. Eighty five per cent of villages lie within a 20 kilometres radius of talukas, and there are typically 300 villages in 30 kilometre radius. One innovation which could increase access and connectivity is the corDECT WiLL. The corDECT WiLL costs about US$ 150 per line. So far2 million lines have been deployed. The corDECT WiLL was developedjointly by Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras and Midas Commu- nications. It provides simultaneous voice and dedicated Internet connectivity of up to 100/200 Kbps for each user, as well as always-on Internet, andenables a wide range of services suited for rural needs even at bandwidthsof 64 Kbps. The corDECT WiLL is provided through an exchange andtower in town and provides coverage for a radius of up to 35 kilometres. Itis well suited to India's climate, as it is able to work at even 55\u00baC and has low power requirements (1 KW) and extremely low start-up costs. Business models Projects based on aid and grants generally do not scale up very successfully, but successful enterprises do, and can scale to all villages.Therefore, using local entrepreneurs to drive ICT can increase its chancesof success and sustainability. One example of this is the entrepreneur-driven operator assisted telephone booths (STD PCOs) introduced into urban areas of India in 1987.Today, 950,000 such PCOs have been established, covering every street ofeven the smallest town. The PCOs generate 25 per cent of India's totaltelecom income and are used by 300 million people. The lesson for rural communities from this initiative is that to serve rural people with incomes of less than US$ 1 a day, it is best to aggregatedemand and let entrepreneurs drive it. The following example of n-Logue Communications is a good business model for entrepreneur-driven ICT service provision. The n-Logue Communications business model has three key components: (1) it gets an entrepreneur in every village to set up a telecentre-style kiosk; (2) it assiststhe establishment of the kiosks by providing a multi-media PC with Webcamera, printer, power back-up, software, training, and 6 months unlimitedaccess to the Internet at a cost of just US$ 1,000; and (3) it partners withthe government, NGOs, private enterprises, schools, hospitals to offer various services through the kiosk. The local entrepreneurs must have completed schooling, at least to grade 10, but need not have seen a computer. They must also be able toeffectively communicate and network in the community. Their kiosk mustE-health in rural communities through community e-centres 111provide telephony, Internet access and various services to the local commu- nity and should channel the information need of their community to the application and content providers. To be sustainable, the kiosks needs toearn US$ 75 per month by providing computer education, photography,DTP (Desktop publishing, typing, e-mail, voice/video mail, e-governanceand other services. E-health through kiosks - it started with e-mail The potential impact of ICT on the health of rural communities was demonstrated when an impending epidemic of chickenpox in a remote village was halted by a simple e-mail to the right people and an instant response from government doctors. ICT applications for healthcare are many. The examples below help to demonstrate its potential and existing benefits. Eye care India has more blind (9 million) than any other country in the world. Yet, 80 per cent of this blindness is due to a treatable problem - cataracts.Currently, Screening Eye Camps are the most common method of outreach. But these camps are only held twice a year at best, and always in the same place. Using ICT, the Screening Eye Camps could be replaced by a moreregular and accessible method of identifying preventable eye diseases such as Remote Eye Care using video-conferencing (figure 18). Through video-conferencing, the patient and counsellor are able to interact, even though they may be hundreds of kilometres from each other. Video-conferencing allows health counsellors to provide online tele- counselling, identify serious problems (triage) and conduct online follow-up after a patient's visit to the hospital. Tele-counselling is conducted by patient counsellors (who may call upon a doctor). Their role is to impress upon people the importance of taking timely treatment for eye-related ailments. They can also provide immediate solutions to non-serious problems (eye drops) and follow-upconsulting for patients who have already undergone treatment in the hospital. An online patient database has been developed, which allows pa- tients to register in advance, and helps the hospital to schedule and trackthe patients who go through the system. These online applications are also provided in local languages. Following the success of the online eye care, general medicine has followed, with online consulting with local doctors such as general practi- tioners, paediatricians and gynaecologists now available. There is also an Online Clinic with a general physician.E-health in rural communities through community e-centres 112How does it work? Through the uptake of the Remote Medical Diagnostic Kit (or ReMeDi), the level and quality of healthcare to rural areas will increase(figure 19). This will facilitate a more complete process that comprises: Remote diagnosis and prescription Delivery of medicines Online post-treatment follow-up Electronic medical records Rural people in developing countries desperately need better health services. Currently, affordability is very low, and expensive gadgetry andequipment is unlikely to make an impact. What is needed is low costsustainable ICT infrastructure, and low cost tele-diagnostic equipment. Thiswill require local and indigenous development efforts and local doctors innearby towns to provide remote health care. Figure 18. Videoconferencing diagnosis Figure 19.

Evaluation and monitoring of the performance of community e-centres Mr. Wimal Gunawardena, Chairman/Managing Director, TEAMS (Pvt) Limited Introduction and project background Any project achieves its objectives in terms of a set of \"cause and effect\" relationships through which project resources and interventions are transformed. In this sense, inputs lead to outputs and outputs expect to generate effects, which are closely related to the immediate objectives of the project. Performance of a project can be seen as a function of \"relationships\" between \"inputs and outputs\" and \"outputs and effects\". Hence, evaluation and monitoring of performance (EMP) can be seen as a process of reviewing these \"relationships.\" Such relationships should be evaluated and monitored continu- ously in order to ensure that the project moves forward, achieving its objectives by generating desirable outputs and effects. EMP involves review- ing actual outputs and effects in terms of expected outputs and effects and then adjusting project inputs such as resources and interventions to minimize the gap between expectations and outcomes. This presentation is based on the experience of an on-going e-community centre project in Sri Lanka. The Community Information Project for the Poor (CIPP) was initi- ated in September 2003 under the auspices of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Ministry of Education (MOE) of Sri Lanka.29 The project involves the transfer of information and communication technology (ICT) to members of low-income communities. The objective of the project is to create opportunities for people with a low income, those who receive a monthly income of less than Rs. 3,000 (or US$ 30) and groups such as farmers, labourers, plantation workers and fishers to participate in economic growth by providing them with vital information. This is a pilot project, in the form of a Technical Assistance (TA) grant given by the Asian Develop- ment Bank for 15 months and implemented by TEAMS Consultants. As a pilot project, CIPP is to serve the poor by establishing Community Information Networks (CINs) in three specific districts of Sri Lanka, namely, the Gampaha, Ratnapura and Kalutara Districts. Each network involves one district Community Information Centre (CIC) and ten Village Information Centres (VICs). The overall project implementation and the functioning of these three networks is coordinated by a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) operating from the MOE. It is anticipated that the stakeholders, together with local operators, will take over the operation of these centres after the project period and sustain the service provision to the poor. Approach used for evaluation and monitoring of performance In accordance with the methodology and implementation strategy adopted by the project, implementation was visualized in two stages. During 29The project was detailed in another presentation of this workshop.Evaluation and monitoring of the performance of community e-centres 114the first stage the focus was on: establishing CICs and their VICs with relevant hardware/software; assessing community needs; and initial capacity building of CIC/VIC operators to serve the community while attracting the rural poor via awareness and promotional programmes. The second stage involved improvement of ICT services to the poor; further capacity building of local operators for efficient management; and activating sustainability measures. At the end of the first Stage, a mid-term project review was undertaken by the ADB and the MOE together with the consultant. Based on this review, major project changes were brought about, including changes to the organizational structure and implementation strategies of the project. Therefore, it is useful to present the procedures of EMP here in terms of the first and second Stage separately after explaining some points corresponding to EMP in general. As mentioned previously, the objective of the project is to provide the target group, the poor, with vital information for livelihood improvement. In these terms, the EMP approach of the project has been to re-organize the required monitoring and evaluation activities to ensure that the centres are established and as many members as possible from poor communities are served at the CICs and VICs and the poor are served at the centres with information required by them for livelihood improvement. As per the project document, CIPP is constituted of three major components: Provision of information services for the poor by establishing CINs (as mentioned before) Assisting local stakeholders to manage CINs by capacity building Social and institutional preparation for sustainability of informa- tion services beyond the project period Hence, the approach adopted for monitoring and evaluation of performance recognizes the need to focus on these three dimensions. This implies that the EMP work undertaken by the project was continuously directed towards the outputs and effects generated by the project in these areas while closely monitoring and adjusting project inputs. The approach used for EMP was based on the information required for performance improvement at different levels. Certain guidelines were required at the levels of VIC, CIC and PIU for evaluating and monitoring performance and to generate the necessary information. The main guide- lines for these different tiers were based on the action plan or work plan developed by the consultant at the inception. Based on the action plan, a set of monthly targets were defined for each CIN in terms of its CIC and VICs. Similarly, monthly targets for the entire project and its three CINs were identified. Performance was evaluated and monitored using these targets. The team leader and the CIC managers met periodically to discuss the information required for and resulting from EMP. The PIU, CICs and VICs generated a set of periodical reports for EMP and further communi- cated with the MOE to brief the project progress. In the process of EMP, steering committees were seen as an important element. steering committees were set up for all the CICs and VICs in the threeEvaluation and monitoring of the performance of community e-centres 115project districts of Gampaha, Ratnapura and Kalutara from the inception. The main functions of the steering committees were the following: (1) to formulate strategies to increase the number of users of CINs from poor community target groups and thus penetrate into the different sections of the community, such as Samurdhi beneficiaries, unskilled workers, casual labourers, unemployed youth, tenant farmers and seasonal farmers; (2) to obtain suggestions on how to improve the project Web sites; (3) to formulate sustainability measures to ensure the continuity of the project after the end of the TA implementation period; (4) for consultation on the provision of community ICT services; and (5) to monitor the overall progress of the TA activities in the CICs/VICs. All these functions are directly relevant to the EMP work of the project. The steering committees met once a month and the main topics for discussion were based on the objectives of the project. The views of thesteering committees were taken into account in order to: (1) reach the poor; (2) improve the services to suit the community needs; and (3) prepare for sustainability. The steering committees for all the CICs and VICs werecomposed of representatives of the relevant stakeholder organizations, insti-tutions and community groups. Members of the steering committee typicallyconsisted of the following: divisional secretary of the area, chairperson ofthe local authority, representatives of NGOs and members of village level community organizations such as farmers' organizations, women's societies, school development societies and cooperative societies. In addition, govern-ment divisional level officers representing social services, youth services,education services, samurdhi services were also members of a steeringcommittee. Evaluation and monitoring during the first stage At the first stage of the project (the first eight months), the focus of EMP work was to evaluate and monitor progress of the project in relation to five major activities undertaken at that stage: (1) establishing CICs and VICs,(2) collection of information required by the poor, (3) motivating the ruralcommunity - especially the rural poor to visit the centres, (4) provision of ICTservices, and (5) initial capacity building of operators of CICs and VICs. The process of EMP began by setting a monthly action plan and monthly targets for each district CIN in the light of the overall action plan of the CIPP and was based on the five main project activities mentioned above. Based on these action plans, the CIC manager briefs the CIC staffand the VIC operators. During this early stage of the project, each CIC wasequipped with a manager/community development specialist, Web designer,network analyst, hardware specialist, two newsletter writers, five informa-tion collectors and an administrative assistant/operator. The technical staff attached to the CICs were occupied in refurbishing VICs and installing equipment and ensuring the functioning of the network while setting the project Web sites. Information collectors (ICs) were responsible for assessing and collecting information requirements of the poor,Evaluation and monitoring of the performance of community e-centres 116rural community via a needs assessment survey and collecting the informa- tion required. At the inception, it was also recognized that certain information that the rural poor required was not available in electronic form such as in the project web sites or in the web sites operated by different institutions and departments. Such information was available only in the form of booklets, manuals and brochures. ICs were instructed to collect these sources of information from various institutes, departments, enterprises, etc. These activities were evaluated and monitored daily. Although certain information collected by the ICs were converted into electronic form into district web sites, others were stocked in each VIC in the form of hard documents. Thus, from the inception there were two major sources of information available at the CICs and VICs: (1) information in electronic form (on Web sites and Internet based); and (2) information in hard form (manuals, booklets, newsflashes and newsletters produced in each CIC). In order for the project to be successful, it is crucial that the members of the target beneficiary group are motivated and attracted to use the CICs and VICs. From the inception of the project, this was undertaken by encouraging village opinion leaders to act as catalysts to the rural, poor communities to make use of the services provided by the centres. In addition, from the commencement of the project, a series of community awareness strategies and promotional programmes were implemented for the opinion leaders while conducting basic computer literacy programmes for them. The effects of these strategies and programmes were continuously monitored and the content and the approach used for delivering the outputs was continuously improved. These programmes and strategies helped opinion leaders to gain confidence in the value of the services provided by the centres as well as for them to act as catalysts to motivate the rural poor to visit the centres. Based on the EMP work during the first stage of the project, a series of focus group discussions were conducted with community opinion leaders and community organizations to promote and enhance their role as catalysts and to refine the information to be provided to the rural poor. Although the initial district information was prepared based on the outcome of the needs assessment survey, these information profiles were refined for the purpose of improving performance. The steering committees were activated and commu- nity opinion leaders and community organizations were encouraged to attract the target group and to refine the information required by the target group. Basic computer literacy programmes conducted for the target group and the opinion leaders in the project areas in each district were also evaluated and monitored to assess their effectiveness by means of evalua- tion procedures attached to the programmes. In addition, the awareness programmes undertaken for the rural poor were also evaluated and moni- tored at the end of each programme. The VICs are the key components of the CINs in terms of providing services to the rural poor. Thus, from the inception of the project, the activities of the VICs were evaluated and monitored on a daily basis. Each VIC wasEvaluation and monitoring of the performance of community e-centres 117required to transmit a Daily Progress Report to its corresponding CIC. The progress reports normally consisted of two parts. The first component of the report dealt with the status/situation relating to computer hardware, software, Internet and telephone connections and electricity supply. This was important at the initial stage of the project, as most of the operators were not very familiar with these aspects of the project, and also failures with Internet and telephone connections and electricity supply were common. The second component of the reports from the VICs dealt with information on the users of the VICs in terms of \"the poor\" and \"others\". Since the users were assisted with Web/Internet-based information as well as with information available in hard form, the users were categorized in these terms in the daily VIC reports. The CICs monitored the project inputs in the form of resources and project interventions required by the VICs, based on these daily VIC reports. Simultaneously, each CIC prepared weekly progress reports and monthlyperformance reports utilizing the information given by the VICs whileevaluating and monitoring its performance in terms of the monthly action plan.The daily reports of the VICs also acted as a supervisory and control tool forthe CICs, as the VICs are scattered and located far away from the CICs. Monthly performance reviews of VICs and CICs were undertaken in two different ways. First, internal reviews by the CIC managers with theparticipation of VIC operators were undertaken; and second, reviews of theVICs and CICs were undertaken with the participation of the correspondingsteering committees. The team leader undertook overall EMP work of the project on a monthly basis with the participation of the CIC Managers. Progress review exercises triggered the adjustment of the project inputs andpreparation of new monthly action plans and new project targets for theincoming month. Evaluation and monitoring during the second stage As mentioned earlier, a mid-term project review was conducted by the ADB with the MOE and the consultants. The review concluded thatalthough the project achieved its targets in terms of establishing CICs andVICs and serving the rural community in the project areas, it had notsufficiently achieved the main objective of providing the poor with accessto vital information for livelihood improvement. Based on this review, a major restructuring of the project was undertaken by changing the composi- tion of the project team and by reducing the technical staff. It was decidedto re-formulate the terms of reference and qualifications of the consultantsby focusing on \"social mobilization,\" \"outreach to the poor\" and \"socialpreparation at the community level for sustainability of CINs\". The projectperiod was extended by four months, while restructuring the project team. The focus of the project during the second stage of the project (after the mid-term review) were the following tasks: (1) increasing the coverageof the target group via social mobilization; (2) improving the provision ofinformation services to the poor; and (3) social and institutional preparationEvaluation and monitoring of the performance of community e-centres 118for sustainability. The new team leader/community information specialist prepared an action plan for the second stage of the project with the help ofeach member of the restructured consultant team in terms of the above-mentioned tasks. This action plan included sub-plans for each CIN and foreach member of the project team. In accordance with the process of EPM adopted in the second stage, at the beginning of each month, the project team with supervision from the team leader, prepares a monthly progress report and Action Plan for the overall project with specific plans and targets for each district CIN. Based on these overall plans, each CIC in the project districts prepares its own action plan including one for each VIC in terms of the three major tasks. In turn, each VIC reports its performance daily to the CIC, giving informa- tion on the number of target group members visiting the centre and the type(s) of information sought by them. The VICs also prepare a weekly progress report using the same format used for the daily progress reports, while providing cumulative figures for the week. The performance of the VICs is also closely monitored by the \"districtfield group\" headed by the social mobilizer and includes the information collectors. This field group prepares an independent weekly performance report covering all the VICs of the district and indicating progress achieved interms of the district action plan. This includes the performance of each VIC in terms of the project targets set and achievements made. The field group prepares its observations in collaboration with a sample of VIC users (i.e.target group members) and hence the reporting provides insights from the rural, poor communities in terms of EMP. In this report, the social mobilizer also indicates the weekly project achievements in the district relevant to thethree main tasks of the second stage of the project. The above mentioned sources of performance information arriving from the field to the CIC are evaluated by the CIC manager weekly forEMP purposes in the light of the CIC action plan. Based on these reviews, the CIC prepares its weekly performance report while analyzing and synthesizing field information. The team leader at the PIU receives the performance reports of CICs weekly on Monday of each new week. The same day, a weekly progress review meeting is conducted by the team leader with the CIC managers, social mobilization specialists, benefit-monitoring and evaluation (BME)specialist, web designers and newsletter writers. The problems and setbacks encountered during the week are discussed and action to overcome these is determined. The measures required for the incoming week for increasingthe coverage of the beneficiary group, improving the provision of informa- tion services including web sites and newsletters and social and institu- tional preparation for sustainability are also determined at these meetings. Each CIC prepares its monthly performance report in terms of the project action plan by indicating the anticipated outcomes and the actual progress. A monthly performance evaluation meeting was held at each CIC,Evaluation and monitoring of the performance of community e-centres 119conducted by the team leader. At these performance reviews, progress for the month is evaluated and the action plan for the incoming month is prepared while taking into account the deviations of the past month and the anticipated results to be achieved prior to termination of technical assis- tance. Steering committee members also contributes significantly in these monthly reviews. In addition, the work of the social mobilization specialist and the BME specialist attached to the PIU are fully tailored to this EMP process. The BME work, which aims to assess the outcome of the project and the benefits that have accrued to the target group, make use of the daily, weekly and monthly performance reports described above and forms an important part of EMP. The social mobilizer and the BME specialist also prepare their own monthly progress reports and the team leader prepares a brief monthly performance report based on the EMP activities, which is used for discussions with the MOE. Conclusions and lessons learned The experience of EMP on this project is interesting, as one could see the process vastly improved from first to the second stage. Simulta- neously, with the improvement of the EMP process, one could easily recognize the improvement of project performance in the different stages.The most important element in the EMP process of the project is theweekly performance reporting during the second stage. Here the VICs (thenucleus of the CIN) submit their performance reports based on their records, which are more quantitative in nature. In parallel, the \"field group\" submits its own report reflecting on the performance of the VICs, which isbased on its qualitative field observations by having met some of the usersof VICs. This combination provides a \"rich picture\" for performance. Recently, through the initiatives of the EMP process and social mobilization work, each district has identified a set of users of the CICsand VICs who need different categories of information and are likely tocontinue using the CINs. For example, there are users who are also fromthe target group of rural poor with a family income of less than Rs. 3,000 per month, who are very small-scale entrepreneurs engaged in activities such as mushroom cultivation, production of coir products, production ofcurd, production of handicrafts, etc. These users are being encouraged touse the CINs to seek both technical information to improve their productioncapabilities and marketing information for business expansion. Specialseminars are conducted with these groups to create awareness on how the CINs could help them in their small business ventures. IT users clubs are being established with such user groups in different areas in the threeproject districts. More and more active rural poor are being encouraged tobecome members of these clubs. These user clubs have activated \"actioncommittees\" among members, which can play an important role in futureEMP work and ensure the sustainability of the community ICT centres once the TA period is over. Recently, the steering committees have in- cluded representation of these clubs and hence it is anticipated that thiswill contribute to the management of the CICs and VICs.Evaluation and monitoring of the performance of community e-centres 120Monthly EMP work undertaken by the project involve the active participation of stakeholders, especially the local agencies that have pro-vided the locations to establish CICs and VICs. This process has helped to gain the confidence of these agencies on the usefulness of CICs and hence the need for their sustainability. In fact, a number of these agencies havealready indicated their willingness to take over the operation of these centres once the TA period is over. The EMP process involving steering committees has also helped the project to identify volunteers to take over the functions of informationcollectors, newsletter writers and VIC operators in the near future. The potential volunteers are currently being given training and such measures are a part of the overall social and institutional preparation for projectsustainability. Stakeholders who have provided locations for CICs and VICs have also been motivated continuously to take over the functioning of these centres. Many have already indicated their willingness to take over thefunctions. From the beginning of February 2005, management of CICs and VICs, and their EMP will be undertaken with stakeholders. This will minimize the dependency syndrome on the project team while building thecapacity for stakeholders to operate the centres once the technical assis- tance of the ADB is over. Undoubtedly, evaluation and monitoring of performance (EMP) is a crucial aspect for any project to be successful in achieving its objectives. The establishment and operation of CeCs in developing countries is reason- ably new. Thus, EMP of CeCs is more important than in other projects toensure their success. T. Technological options for community e-centres Mr. Rezwan Alauddin, Head of IT, Grameen Telecom Community e-centre The technological options for community e-centre (CeCs) largely depends on the services that a centre wishes to provide, as there is no need to spend money on high-end hardware if there is no use for it within thecentre. Therefore, the centre must: Have a minimum standard hardware and software configurationso that services are similar and delivered in the desired manner Be networked and connected to the Internet to get the fullbenefits of the network The technology chosen should be adaptable and extendable, as it does not make economic sense to choose hardware that is not adaptable, as updates can be costly. Therefore, modular designsare the best optionTechnological options for community e-centres 121Technology choices Technological choices can be broken down into the following: Power supply : A constant reliable power supply is needed Uninterruptible power supply (UPS) back up is essential for the centres Solar power supply stores energy car batteries - this is one option Hardware : Computer hardware specification has to be chosen wisely, and should be largely dependant on the software that will run on thecomputer as the hardware should be capable of running thesoftware Peripheral devices appropriate for the local demand for servicesare also a good option Connectivity : There are a variety of options in terms of connectivity. The optimal choice has to be made based on factors such as reliabil-ity, bandwidth, speed, availability and cost Software : The need to choose between licensed and open source software The benefits and drawbacks of each have to be weighed before choosing what application and operating systems to run Hardware configuration Personal computers (PCs) are affordable and widely available and computing power is constantly increasing. Therefore, CeCs should have atleast two PC's with Internet access for the initial phase, but with the option to expand later, if more resources become available, or client needs change. Multimedia computers are most beneficial for the centres. Multime- dia computers have graphics cards, which allow users to play videos and display high-powered graphics. They also have CD/DVD drives, speakers,microphones and software for playing rich content. Fortunately, computing processing power is increasing everyday and high-powered processors are now available at reasonable prices. IBMcompatible machines may be used with processors such as the Intel Pentium,AMD Athlon or more affordable processors such as Celeron, Duron, Geode,Sempron. The correct processor has to be chosen based on the workload. At present a minimum of 256MB RAM (memory) and storage capacity of at least 40GB disk space is quite reasonable for each machine. In areas where the power supply is unreliable, an uninterrupted power supply (UPS) is essential to prevent damage to the computer systemand loss of data.Technological options for community e-centres 122Peripheral devices Peripheral devices such as a web camera and microphone to enable video conferencing with family and friends abroad can provide a critical service for rural or remote communities. Other useful additional devices include a digital camera, which can enable the centre to provide photographic services. A scanner for digitizing photographs and documents such as land records is a worthwhile addition also, as it enables documents to be recorded, e-mailed or sent off togovernment departments as needed. A further, important addition to a CeC is a printer able to do both document and photographic printing. There are a number of options, including an inkjet printer, which is cost effective,produces good quality prints, and has low consumable costs. A second option is a laser printer. It prints at a higher speed, produces excellent quality prints and is ideal for high-volume printing. Touch screen monitors should be considered also, particularly in centres where guided information is presented to users. Connectivity Connection to the Internet and other networks is a necessity for CeC to function. Centres should have Internet-enabled PC's and should be networked through a LAN for connection and file sharing. Where there are fixed landline telephone connections available, a dial-up networking connection is ideal. Dial-up connections are a low cost,relatively reliable option. If this is not available, there are other alterna-tives, such as store and forward networks. Using this option, a form ofasynchronous communication as messages are stored on the local machineuntil a physical transport module (bus, motorcycle) uploads and downloads the messages as it goes past the e-centres. Dial-up is ideal for areas where fixed landline telephone connections are available. Other options include VSAT, which is a high speed satellite connec- tion. This is effective, and even essential for remote or mountainous locations. However, there is a high initial setup cost. Fixed line broadbandis a high speed, reliable solution. It too, however, requires a great deal ofinitial investment in laying cables and forming large networks. Fixed linebroadband is suitable for e-centres in areas where e-centre density is high,and competition between centres is greater. A General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a non-voice value-added service that allows information to be sent and received across a mobile telephone network. This option enables fast data transfer of up to 171 kbps, which is three times faster than dial-up connections over fixed line net-works. It is an effective communications medium for e-centres in areaswhere GSM coverage is present (ideal for countries like Bangladesh). Wireless LAN (WiLAN, cordect) is broadband wireless access (BWA) technology that extends short range Wi-Fi to larger areas, within an area up to 35 km in radius. It is still relatively expensive, but is veryTechnological options for community e-centres 123suitable for CeCs. It enables rapid deployment of networks that are highly scalable and extendable, which can be ideal for CeCs particularly where there is no landline connectivity. Other considerations include deciding whether to choose a licensed or unlicensed frequency. With a licensed frequency there is no interference, but users have to pay a fee to the government. With an unlicensed frequency, usersmay get interference, which may decrease the bandwidth and bit rate. Network architectures The type of network architecture used should be based on the chosen connectivity method. For example, a hub-centric network has a central server and all CeCs in a certain area are connected to this central server which acts as a proxy and provides data services to the e-centres.This network is most appropriate for a wireless broadband service, as it requires high speed connections between the hub and e-centres. However, the costs of hardware are reduced using this option, as fewer expensiveservers are required. An alternative to the hub-centric network is the localized server, which has a service in each centre. Using this system, the local server connectsdirectly to the Internet. This is suitable for areas where high-speed connectiv- ity in unavailable. It enables all information to be concentrated in each e- centre. However for any external information, centres have to go online. E-community - service delivery methods The localization of the computer system is essential for the effective delivery of services. Centres need a local graphical user interface (GUI) in local languages, which will make computers more accessible to people who are not proficient in English. It is important to use software that has a localizedinterface in the language most applicable to the community using the centre. If GUI is not possible, an audio interface in the local language, which could be provided for the dissemination of information is analternative. The audio interface can work as either text-to-speech or voice recognition. When using text-to-speech, words highlighted on the screen are read out to the user. This can help illiterate and visually impaired people ingetting access to information. Voice recognition enables computers to be operated using voice commands to open applications and for typing. This can also be used by illiterate people or people without proficiency intyping. Users can also control computer using voice recognition. The system is not yet completely effective, but it is an option to consider. Currently, R&D is being carried out into ways to make text-to-speech andvoice recognition services available in a wider array of languages. Choice of operating system (OS) - the software side The choice of the operating system is the key factor in determining the cost of software systems for the CeCs.Technological options for community e-centres 124CeCs have the choice between licensed operating systems such as Windows XP or open source software such as Linux, which is avail-able for a nominal cost. Currently, 80 per cent of desktops run onMicrosoft Windows, and most users are familiar with the Windows envi-ronment. Windows-compatible software is most widely available. Licensedoperating systems have a heavy initial acquisition cost and requireenhanced PC configurations. The benefits, however, include technicalsupport and frequent updates. Open source operating systems such asLinux are more affordable, and can be customized, but need more usertraining. CeCs could consider combining the two systems by having a cen- tral server architecture running Linux at the back end and have CeCclients running Windows XP starter editions in the centre. The startereditions are cheaper than the normal version and designed for low-cost,entry-level desktop PCs. This combination could be a satisfactory com-parison, saving costs and ensuring user-friendly interfaces and technicalsupport. Application software options The application software options are dependant on the operating system platform that is chosen. Customized software will have to bedeveloped according to the services that the centres provide. Software hasto be designed in a manner in which it can constantly evolve with theneeds of the people. It should be designed so that it can be added to andchanged frequently. Content-driven web portals can also be used to dissemi-nate information and services. Diagnosis system utilities, preventive maintenance Regular diagnosis and preventive measures have to carried out to ensure continued high performance of the CeCs' computer systems. Utilitiessuch as firewalls, spyware removers, and anti-virus software are essentialfor computers connected to the Internet, as they are prone to maliciousattacks. Regular backups also have to be carried out to ensure that data isnot lost in the event of system crashes. Technology - the critical success factor The technological option chosen for an e-centre is one of the critical factors in determining the success of the centre. Technology has to bechosen very carefully so that it supports the services offered by the centres.Technology is just the means - service is the most critical factor. Further,the technology has to be extended gradually as the centre grows and services increase; having the latest hardware and fastest connections does not mean that the e-centres will succeed. It is the content and services thatare most important for the success of the centres.Technological options for community e-centres 125U. Marketing and types of services provided through community e-centres Mr. Ashok Jhunjhunwala, Professor, Electrical Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Madras, India The Internet can empower rural India by providing access to educa- tion and healthcare and by increasing livelihood options either through agriculture or micro-enterprises. Technology can impact on lives provided that there is a big enough vision behind it - the dream should be to double the per-capita rural GDP. To achieve this, a large number of innovative technologies and applications need to be developed catering specifically to rural areas. In this presentation, some innovations that have already been developed and put into use will be detailed. Health One successful example of the application of ICT in improving the health of rural communities is n-Logue (figure 20).30 n-Logue is a rural service provider set up by a group including a university faculty and entrepreneurs and is a good business model for entrepreneur-driven ICT service provision. n-Logue kiosks are established in villages with an aggregate demand in each village with a population of 1,000 or more. It is owned and driven by a local entrepreneur, and the start up costs are US$ 1,000 per kiosk, to enable it to provide telephones, Internet, multimediaPCs with Web cameras, printers and power back-up. Kiosks are also given Indian language software, video conferencing software, training and mainte- nance and six months unlimited Internet access. Figure 20. The n-Logue network 30See Mr. Jhunjhunwala's previous presentation - e-health in Rural Communities and the presentation by Ms. Karishma Kiri for more details.Marketing and types of services provided through community e-centres 126Education Through the CeCs, courses for various age groups can be provided in the local language. The CeCs can also function as school classrooms forremote teaching services. Remote teaching is designed to tutor childrenwith limited access to regular schooling in different subjects. Limited access can be the result of a number of factors such as the remoteness of a village, the lack of good teachers in the area, the economicsituation of a child's family and so on. Recognizing that these factors canhave an impact on the schooling of a child, the courses aim to helpstudents pass their school examinations, enabling them to graduate fromschool, an achievement which is highly valued in rural India. In a pilotproject conducted in several villages in 2003, the courses significantlyimproved the pass-percentage of participating students. Social studies and geography are widely used subjects for online lessons, with the most popular tutorial being the Spoken English course,which is designed to train student to learn spoken English. All the coursesare multimedia and online (figure 21). Figure 21. A remote teaching class E-government services Many government services can be provided through Internet kiosks to villages. One application that has worked particularly well is Web-Durbar. Web-Durbar allows decision makers in towns and city centres totalk to multiple villages via single and multi-party video-conferencing. Thisenables more inclusive and participatory decision-making, and an outcomethat is satisfactory to both citizens and government.Marketing and types of services provided through community e-centres 127Livelihood The livelihood applications of ICT and CeCs have the largest potential of all the CeC services. Rural micro-enterprises can be the wealthenablers, but villages need assistance in starting up micro-enterprises. Fourcomponents that are required for micro-enterprises: Finance - not traditional micro-finance which has very high charges, but rather finance with industry-based rates isneeded Knowledge support and training - quality control, packaging is key in many areas, especially in crafts and even agriculture.More training and support is needed on this Buying, selling and logistics - village entrepreneurs need help to move goods from rural to urban areas, transport infrastruc-ture, at a low cost Risk sharing - the ability of rural people to take risks has decreased considerably in recent years, so there needs to be risksharing It is better to leverage the skills of rural producers. Through ICT, a virtual university can be set up in every district, which can have a majorimpact on the skills base of a district. The enabling elements are trainingand development for the creation of new skills and the increase ofknowledge. To do this, the following are needed: Education and Training Centres - to impart distance educa- tion, with some contact programmes Knowledge Centres and Clearing Houses - for all types of problems and questions to offer expertise on a variety of sub- jects Information Dissemination Centres for - best practices, FAQs, R&D and innovations Agricultural initiatives Farmers need daily market information for the National Commodities and Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX). Through the kiosks, NCDEX pricesare provided and automatically refreshed four times a day on local services.Data on spot and futures prices of various commodities are also provided as is guidance on growing crops based on market demand and expectations. In the near future, commodity brokerage services will be provided togroups of farmers to hedge their risks (figure 22). Agriculture insurance provided by ICICI Lombard has already been introduced and weather insurance is being tested. This could be useful for dry land farmers. Training partnerships with companies with expertise inmicro-irrigation and drip irrigation systems are also being explored.Marketing and types of services provided through community e-centres 128Conclusion There is little doubt that with access to and some training on ICT, much can be achieved. A clear demonstration of this is the greeting cardsproduced by rural children using desktop publishing programmes, all ofwhom had less than six months exposure to computers. With 700 million inhabitants, rural areas can be a large internal market for goods and services, but currently incomes are largely spent onsustenance items such as food, housing and education. Additional incomewill be spent on goods and services however, and a potential market forIndian as well as multinational products does exist. Kiosks are alreadydistributing Indian oil; lubricants; new and second hand motorcycles;tractors and spare parts; and fertilizers and other products. Further, theInternet can empower rural India by providing access to education, healthcare and livelihood opportunities. Therefore, innovative technologies andapplications need to be developed that cater specifically to rural areas.Harvest & Transportation of Produce FacilitationRisk & Insurance Production Risk Price RiskMarket Information & Linkage Facilitation Storage Facilitation Knowledge & Extension FacilitationIrrigation FacilitationCredit Facilitation Inputs Facilitation Seeds Fertilisers Pesticides Farm MachineryTHE FARMER\u00a4 \u00a4 \u00a4 \u00a4\u00a4\u00a4\u00a4\u00a4Marketing and types of services provided through community e-centres Figure 22. What does the farmer need? 129131PART TWO Summary of country reports132133SUMMARY OF COUNTRY REPORTS A. Bangladesh More than two-thirds of Bangladesh's population live in rural areas and is engaged predominantly in agriculture and other non-farm agricultural activities such as fish culture, cow and goat rearing, food processing and handicrafts productions. Internet and ICT related services are provided by theGovernment-run telecommunications organization, the Bangladesh Telephone and Telegraph Board (BTTB), and other private Internet Service Providers (ISPs). The independent Telecommunications Regulatory Commission hasgiven licenses to 19 private operators to establish telecommunications linkages in different parts of the country other than the capital. Some of the operators have already started establishing telephone exchanges and there ispotential, through these operators, to provide ICT services to rural people as their services are targeted to areas not fully covered by BTTB so far. The Government has given priority to the development of the rural population and particularly to poverty alleviation of rural people. Poverty alleviation through IT education and use of ICT related services has beenemphasized in the National ICT Policy 2002. The concept of the commu- nity e-centre (CeC) has not been developed in Bangladesh. Currently, cyber caf\u00e9s largely provide access to ICTs. The most frequent users of the caf\u00e9s are students, graduates, job seekers, service holders and business people. The Internet caf\u00e9s are often overcrowded and provide only limited services. B. Bhutan The majority of the Bhutanese live in rural communities, mainly composed of scattered settlements, which are difficult and expensive to access with conventional roads and basic telecommunications. This hascreated a critical mass of \"haves\" and \"have-nots'' among rural and urban communities. The Ministry of Information and Communications has identi- fied community e-centres as the best method to address this divide byassisting connectivity and access in rural communities. The first CeC was established in Bhutan in 1998 in the town of Jakar. Unfortunately, it did not do well and was eventually shut down. The major reason for the failure of the CeC was a lack of public awareness. Another hurdle was the unwillingness and fear of people to learn about newtechnologies. Despite the failure of the first centre, Bhutan Post has established 17 public kiosks in 17 different districts on a pilot basis to study the viability of e-post and to increase the overall efficiency of internal communications.These public kiosks were established with financial aid from the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). Further, the Department of Information Technology is currently carrying out pilot implementation of CeCs in threerural locations in the eastern district of Tashiyangtse.Summary of Country Reports134C. Cambodia Cambodia is a late comer to the Internet era with commercial services only launched in 1997. It has the lowest Internet penetration in South-eastAsia as well as the highest prices. Apart from the obvious barrier of poverty, exasperated by exceptionally high Internet prices, Cambodia faces a combi- nation of factors that inhibit the expansion of the Internet in the country.These include the lack of a vibrant academic community that could help nurture and sustain computerization of written Khmer language, extreme shortage of dial-up telephone lines needed to access the Internet, andgovernment policies that have restricted Internet supply. Despite these challenges, Cambodia has an estimated 13,000 Internet users, most of them in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap. There are about 100Internet caf\u00e9s throughout Cambodia, these also mostly located in Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, Sihanoukville and a small number in other tourist centres. In every provincial capital, there is generally at least one Internet access pointeach. Most of them offer web and e-mail access and some also offer voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) at a very low cost. Although V oIP was declared illegal by the Ministry of Post and Telecommunication (MPTC) in 1998, sofar it has not been consistently suppressed. Not many of keyboards or websites can handle Khmer fonts so a certain level of English language knowledge is a prerequisite for accessing the Internet. There are threeInternet Service Providers (ISPs) in Cambodia - Big Pond, set up by Telstra, Australia in 1997, Camnet, operated by MPTC (following its initial establish- ment with Cambodia assistance) and TeleSurf (operated by MOBITEL). D. China Since 1978, communication infrastructure construction in China's rural areas has been developing rapidly. By 2002, there were 101.967million telephone subscribers in rural areas and TV viewer rating hadreached 94.6 per cent. However, the development of information communi- cation technology (ICT) is still in the primary stage. According to a China National Network Information Centre (CNNIC) census, there were only 87million Internet users till the end of 2003, and less than three per cent ofusers were from the agricultural, forestry and fishery sector. Currently, there are nearly 3,000 agricultural web sites in China: most are owned by public service units, research institutes, agricultural universities, Internet enterprises as well as private companies. Their content normally focuses on specific products (e.g. flowers, tea, poultry, pig raising,fruit and vegetable production). The users are mainly extentionists, brokers,processors and farmers' technical associations. The main challenges toimproving rural information services and building rural community e-centres are weak IT infrastructure construction at the county level; depen- dence on Government financial input for the installment of IT apparatusSummary of Country Reports135and operational costs at township level information service stations; com- paratively low educational levels in rural areas; and the huge variation inthe information needs of small scale farms. E. Fiji The rural maritime and inland areas are home to the majority of Fiji's population and Fiji's key exporting and service industries. However, there hasbeen an absolute decline in the rural and outer island population as rapidurbanization has taken place over the last years. This is due partly to the lowerlevel of service provision in some areas owing to remoteness and the lack of transportation services. This lack of services constrains the development of rural businesses and the commercialization of agriculture. The provision ofcommunity e-centres in Fiji is a key policy for the development of rural andouter islands, and ICT services was stated in the Strategic Development Plan2003-2005. This plan provided the basis for the implementation of the firstseries of rural CeCs in 2003 by the Government and Telecom Fiji Limited. The performance of these centres is being monitored as a pilot project. The initial response has been generally positive. However, one ofthe major constraints is the level of computer literacy in the rural areas.Although training is being provided through the project, the lack ofknowledge in the operation of computers and use of the Internet hasaffected the operation of the centres in terms of the required level of usertraffic for sustainable operations. Another constraint is the management of the CeCs finances. The Government is working towards providing basic telecommunications services to connect the remaining 600 villages to thenational telecommunication network. This will enable the upgrading ofservices to a much better level with Internet connectivity. The GovernmentDepartment of Information Technology and Computing Services (ITCS) istargeting the establishment of one to two community e-centres per year. F. India Three-quarters of the Indian population lives in rural and remote areas and has little to no access to information. Due to the variation inlandscape and climate throughout India, the needs of rural communities canvary greatly. Further, India has 22 official languages and more than 45spoken languages (approximately 350 dialects) across the country - there-fore, one of the major challenges in providing efficient services through community e-centres is the availability of appropriate content in local languages. Other concerns include connectivity, reliable power, appropriateuser-friendly technology, training and above all, changing the mindset ofpeople to adapt and absorb new technologies and business processes. The Department of Information Technology has been working on a wider proliferation of ICT-enabled community e-centres (integrated servicedelivery centres) with a focus on improving rural service delivery. A policySummary of Country Reports136framework is being evolved which would outline and calibrate government interventions to establish a large number of such centres across the countrywithin a specific time period. Records available for the last five yearsreport that at least 200 initiatives in the field of citizen services, education,health, and e-governance-related ICT kiosks/community centres have been set up in rural India. These have been initiated by both government and non-government agencies. The Department of Information Technology is thelead agency spearheading the Government's initiatives. The success of theseinitiatives has varied, but among these projects there have been someencouraging successes which are scalable and replicable. These include thefollowing projects: Rural Access to Services through the Internet (RASI), e- Chaupal, AKSHAYA, TARAhaat, community information centre (CIC), e- Seva, and Drishtee. G. Indonesia According to statistical data from the Indonesian Statistic Centre, 58 per cent of Indonesians live in rural areas. Along with the large gap betweenurban and rural dwelling, there is also the gap between urban and ruraldevelopment, with rural areas generally considered to be poorer than urban areas. The exploitation of natural resources in rural areas in Indonesia has not only resulted in an economic gap, but also uneven development distribution.Moreover, environmental conservation is neglected. Hence, the consequencesare natural catastrophes that cause the rural community to suffer even further. To address the imbalance in development between urban and rural areas the Public Works Department and the Agriculture Department insti-tuted the \"agropolitan\" approach in 2001. The \"agropolitan\" approach is focused on rural areas with a population between 50,000 to 150,000 people and its activities are designed to increase access to and distribution of ruralcommunity products. In 2004, the \"agropolitan\" programme was expandedto 30 provinces in Indonesia. The introduction of information technologyinto rural communities, via community e-centres is necessary for thesuccess of the \"agropolitan\" project and for enabling rural communities to be more competitive. H. Mongolia Since the 1990s, Mongolia has been moving from a centrally- planned economy to a market economy. In the past, the rural economy was a reservoir not only for employment and livelihoods, but also for Mongolia's economic growth and exports. Figures from 2004 show that44.5 per cent of all workers are employed in the agricultural sector and theagricultural sector accounts for 20 per cent of GDP. At the same time,more than half of the rural population belongs to poor and vulnerablegroups, who are mostly engaged in agricultural production.Summary of Country Reports137The National Agricultural Extension Centre was established several years ago by the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, and is working towardsthe development of an extension network throughout Mongolia. Currently, allaimags have provincial branch offices. These extension centres play animportant role in disseminating information and technology and linking producers and researchers. However, due to limited finance and poor infrastructure (no electricity, bad roads), the more remote communities arenot included in such activities. The National Agricultural Extension Centre'sproposed Midterm Action Plan plans to expand its service to the soum andbag level (lowest administrative unit) and build more modernized, highlyequipped centres. There is an urgent need to build community e-centres with the aim of facilitating people's participation at all levels of the development effort. Poor infrastructure and costs are the main constraints. I. Nepal Nepal is a land-locked country with 85.8 per cent of population living in rural areas. Analysis of the rural household economy in Nepal indicatesthat only 40 per cent of the income of an average rural household comesfrom farming and the remaining 60 per cent comes from other incomesources (Statistical Pocket Book, Nepal, CBS 2002). Nepal's 10 th Five Year Plan has four broad based objectives: (a) economic growth; (b) social sector development; (c) social inclusion; and (d) targeted programmes and goodgovernance, which emphasis the development of ICTs and establishment ofcommunity e-centres (CeCs) in rural areas. The Plan also focuses onovercoming the information gap in rural areas by using ICTs. Nepal's first community e-centre was officially inaugurated on 29 August 2003 at Bhimphedi Rural Market Centre. Seventeen such CeCshave been established in selected wards. Another pilot project to install 15rural CeCs in 15 different Village Development Committees (VDCs) innine districts is also already under way, under the joint management of the Ministry of Science and Technology's (MOST) National Information Tech- nology Centre (NITC) and the UNDP-funded ICT for developmentprogramme. Issues facing the widespread establishment community e-cen-tres include low penetration of ICTs; relative novelty of the concept; andcapacity gap of local institutions. J. Philippines Community e-centres (CeC) in the Philippines are still in their infancy. The Philippine Government has undertaken efforts to promote ICT in business, education, governance and infrastructure. However, these are mostly in urban areas. Most CeCs have been established through the jointefforts of the public and private sectors. The precursor of CeCs in thePhilippines were established through the Department of Science and Tech-nology (DOST) -Philippine Council for Health Research and DevelopmentSummary of Country Reports138(PCHRD). It established two CeCs in Mindanao in 1999. The DOST- National Computer Corporation (NCC) also launched the e-LGU Projectwhich has CeCs as a component, while the Department of Transportationand Communication (DOTC) through its Telecommunications office pro-vides basic communication services in almost all localities in the country. The Medium Term Development Plan of the Philippines (2001-2004) states that access of regions to basic ICT shall be expanded through CeCsand that Filipinos shall at anytime have faster and wider access toinformation necessary for learning and knowledge creation. As such, sev-eral initiatives have been undertaken by the Government: (1) TelehealthNetwork Services in Community Partnership Programmes; (2) setting up of the Commission of Information and Communications Technology (CICT), a commission with a private sector advisory body established by the Presi-dent of the Philippines, to promote and develop ICT in the Philippines; (3)e-governance for Local Government Units (LGU); (4) Barangay.Net, aproject piloted with the aim of setting up CeCs in communities that wouldserve as a one-stop resource centre for constituents providing access to barangay information and other subject-specific information; and (5) the Community Information Centre which was set up as a way of bringing ICTto remote communities to improve their socio-economic conditions. K. Sri Lanka Agriculture is the key economic sector in Sri Lanka. It constitutes 20 per cent of the GDP and employs more than one-third of the local work force.In agricultural communities, largely in rural areas, usage of ICT is minimal, affecting their ability to get the maximum price for their products and their awareness of new technology. The ICT infrastructure development programmewithin the Government's e-Sri Lanka initiative will address the current ICTconnectivity issues in rural areas. This programme plans to establish accesspoints known as Vishva Gnana Kendra (VGK) or Global Knowledge Centresin rural areas in order to offer a range of ICT-related services. This project will be implemented in two phases. Under the first phase, it is expected that 100 VGKs will be established selected districts in southern, northern and easternparts of the country. These CeCs will not only have Internet facilities, but willalso be provided with local content relevant to the community. The issues to be resolved to realize the full potential of these centres include: low rates of computer literacy; language barriers; lack of aware-ness and skill; lack of skilled people to manage the Internet environment;reliability and high-speed communication; and privacy and security. Anotherproject, the Regional Telecommunication Networks Project seeks to enable Internet access in remote and rural areas by providing a subsidy to service providers to construct telecommunication networks and requiring them toprovide mandatory service in the form of telephone, fax, Internet accessand e-mail to the rural populations through CeCs.Summary of Country Reports139L. Thailand IT2010 is the policy framework for Thailand's ICT development for the year 2001-2010. It was endorsed by the Cabinet in March 2002. IT2010sets the key development objectives in order to exploit the benefits ofinformation and communications technology to move Thailand to a\"Knowledge-based\" society and economy. In addition to this framework,there is a need for the National ICT Master Plan to identify more specificstrategies. The ICT Ministry is expected to spearhead and coordinate allpolicy, strategies and work programmes as declared within IT2010 and theNational ICT Master Plan. One important strategy is the utilization of ICTto enhance the quality of life and society, emphasizing the development andapplication of an equitable information infrastructure for areas such aseducation and rural development. There are several organizations in Thailand which are working with the CeC concept. These organizations, together with the National Electronicsand Computer Technology Center (NECTEC), the Ministry of Informationand Communication Technology, the World Bank and the Ministry of Interior,have started to work together in sharing ideas and implementing them.Several CeCs for rural development have been established in recent years, forexample, the Government has invested in four pilot CeCs managed byNECTEC. The objective of the pilot project is to experiment and make theseCeCs a gateway to electronic commerce for communities. Another notableproject was initiated and run by a joint-effort between Thailand andMassachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) (the Suksa-Pattana Foundationand the Thaicom Foundation). The project is located in Ban SamKha villagein Lampang Province, and aims to empower communities through project-based learning experiences. Other e-community projects include InternetTambon, CATNet, one temple one e-learning centre (OTEC) and thebroadband e-learning project of His Majesty, the King of Thailand. M. Uzbekistan Uzbekistan is situated in the centre of Eurasia on the Great Silk Road, serving as the gate between the East and the West. With a population of morethan 25 million, its GDP grew by 8.4 per cent between January throughSeptember 2004. The number of mobile phone users reached 396,000 inJanuary 2004. Rapid development of ICT is one of the main State goals andhas been supported by a Decree by the President of the Republic of Uzbekistanin May 2002, \"On further development of computerization and ICT implemen-tation\" and a Resolution by the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic ofUzbekistan in June 2002, \"On measures of further computerization and ICTimplementation\". Under this resolution the Computerization and ICT Develop-ment Programme for 2002-2010 was adopted.Summary of Country Reports140The main goals of the programme are: development of up-to-date telecommunications infrastructure and national Internet network; creation ofenvironment for computerization development; development of a domesticsoftware exporting industry; formation of national information resources;training of highly skilled specialists in ICT; perfection of legislation; andproviding information security. N. Viet Nam Viet Nam is an agricultural country. More than 75 per cent of the population lives in rural area and the main income is generated throughagriculture. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD)of Viet Nam is the Government agency responsible for management ofagriculture and the rural development sector in Viet Nam. The need forinformation exchange between MARD and the agriculture administrativeagencies and other ministries is huge. From 2002, with the assistance ofUNDP, MARD has carried out a pilot project aimed at improving informa-tion exchange between MARD and provincial agriculture and rural develop-ment departments. MARD has also been carrying out a pilot project on building community e-centres (CeCs) in provinces in the north, central and southregions. Thirteen CeCs in rural areas will be set up to serve the informa-tion needs of farmers and to support agricultural production and ruraldevelopment at the grass roots level. These centres are supported by theNational Agriculture Extension Centre and MARD who will supply infor-mation to an agricultural experts' network with the capability of deliveringelectronic information to farmers and representative's offices through theCeCs. Some NGOs have also started to establish CeCs for informationexchange in remote areas, however these non-government activities are onlyin their beginning phase and are limited at present.Summary of Country Reports141ANNEXES142143ANNEX I WORKSHOP AGENDA Wednesday , 8 December 2004 08:30 - 09:00 Registration09:00 - 09:30 Opening Ceremony Welcome Remarks by: Chief, ICT Applications Section, Information, Communication and Space Technology Division,UN ESCAP Opening Remarks by: Dr. Raymond Renfro, Director, Capacity Building and Training, ADBI (byvideoconference fromTokyo) Election of Officers Group Photo Session 09:30 - 10:00 Coffee break 10:00 - 10:40 Introduction to the Workshop and of Participants and Resource Speakers by Mr. Jeoung-Keun Lee,Senior Capacity Building Specialist, ADBI 10:40 - 12:00 Overview of Community e-Centres in Asia and the Pacific by Chief, ICT Applications Section, Infor-mation, Communication and Space TechnologyDivision, UN ESCAP 12:00 - 13:00 Lunch13:00 - 14:30 Country Reports of Cambodia, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Lao People's Democratic Republic,Mongolia, Nepal, Philippines and Sri Lanka (Chair-person) 14:30 - 15:00 Coffee break 15:00 - 17:00 Country Reports of Bangladesh, Bhutan, People's Republic of China, Fiji, India, Thailand, Uzbekistan, and Viet Nam (Chairperson) Thursday , 9 December 2004 08:30 - 10:00 Use of Satellites for Rural Development by Mr. Eui-Kon Koh, President, Asia-Pacific SatelliteCommunications Council (APSCC) 10:00 - 10:30 Coffee breakAnnex I: Workshop agenda14410:30 - 11:15 Connecting People in Rural Communities through ICT: The Grameen Telecom Experience by Mr.Rezwan Alauddin, Head of IT, Grameen Telecom 11:15 - 12:00 Social Capital and the Network Effects: Implications of China's e-Learning and Rural ICT Initiatives byMr. Alexander G.

INTRODUCTION One of today's challenges of information and communication tech- nology (ICT) expansion is the spontaneous participation of rural people inelectronic communications. About 80 per cent of the total population ofBangladesh is living in rural areas. They are a poor and neglected group of the society. Accessibility to ICT devices is much lower in rural areas than in urban area. Very often the farmers are deprived of minimum earnings from their productions due to lack of proper information. ICT enabled services coulddisseminate information on agriculture, health and sanitation awarenessfaster, and for the betterment of the livelihood of the rural people. There are several models of community e-centres (CeCs) including civic telecentres, telecentres franchises, phone shops and multipurposecommunity telecentres. Among these, the public telephone shops are commonin Bangladesh. There are telephone, fax, e-mail and Internet service centresin urban areas of Bangladesh. The number of such centres is rapidly growing and encouraging as is the use of mobile phones in Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, Grameen Phone - a private mobile phone company, along withother mobile phone companies, have expanded their telephone services toalmost every village in the country. These phone shops facilities are highlyvalued by users and the general community, and are adding commercial andsocial value to the economy. However, rural areas are still largely without ICT-enabled services and proper ICT infrastructure in such areas are needed to match what is available in urban areas of the country. ICT has been declared as the thrust sector of the country by the Government. The Government of Bangladesh emphasizes greatly the imple-mentation of the national ICT policy for achieving the Millennium Devel- opment Goals (MDGs). The national ICT policy envisions building a knowledge-based society by 2006, where equalized access to informationallows empowerment of citizens, enhanced democracy and sustainableeconomic development. Major objectives of the national ICT policy are to:extend Internet facilities to all district headquarters and subsequently to itsadjacent areas up to sub-district level; provide Internet to the educational institutions and libraries; and to ensure public access to information, setting up cyber kiosks in all Post Offices, Sub-District and Union complexes. The Ministry of Science and Information and Communication Tech- nology (MOSICT) in Bangladesh is implementing the mandate of theGovernment in the ICT sector.Bangladesh156II. BACKGROUND, ISSUES AND RATIONALE The majority of Bangladeshi citizens live in rural areas, where accessibility to ICT is much lower than in urban areas. Agriculture including fisheries and livestock is the main source of earnings for the majority of the people and hence the use of ICT in these sectors can help agriculture-based, rural communities to reap their unutilized potentials, thereby improving their socio-economic conditions. In order to address rural poverty, the Government is implementing various projects. Despite all these efforts however, about half of the populationis below the poverty level. The majority of the large population engaged inagriculture do not have sufficient access to the market and market information. Bangladesh has a very low teledensity (2.9 per cent). This level of teledensity is due to: Low telecommunications infrastructure Low literacy rate Low ICT literacy rate Poverty Lack of awareness Lack of technology Absence of initiatives At present Bangladesh Telephone and Telegraph Board (BTTB) is providing countrywide telecommunication coverage. Grameen Phone is alsocovering 61 out of 64 districts. Bangladesh Telecommunication RegulatoryCommission (BTRC) is issuing new licenses to some private institutions forestablishing fixed phones lines in some regions in the country. People of Bangladesh are now waiting for Fiber Optic Submarine Cable Network which is expected to be available by 2005. It will enable fast data communications. III. THE PROPOSED PROJECT The proposed project will target the rural community regardless of their income or wealth. It will also address the above-mentioned issues.The lack of existing telecommunications infrastructure poses great chal- lenges in providing Internet connectivity to rural population. Through the implementation of this pilot project, accessibility to ICT will be increasedwhich will enhance education and skill, promote agri-business and rural development, healthcare facilities, etc. A. Purposes and objectives The goal of the project is to create an ICT oriented society where the poor have access to ICT and thereby benefit, as economic growth isenhanced and the vicious cycle of poverty broken. The purpose of the project is to empower rural people by increasing ICT accessibility and providing ICT applications for their socio-economic activities. Under this project 10 CeCs will be established in Bangladesh. ICT is the most effective tool for acquiring information needed for socio-Bangladesh157economic development, particularly in rural communities. It is expected that this project will enable the rural people to develop their livelihood andempower the community with ICT. The main objectives of the projects are: 1. To empower rural communities by increasing ICT accessibility; 2. To provide ICT applications for socio-economic activities;3. To design a sustainable CeC model according to community type and needs; 4. To emphasize public-private partnership in financing and com- munity ownership in management; 5. To implement pilot CeCs in the rural areas as designed;6. To develop community-based ICT applications that could create employment and business opportunities in communities; 7. To develop local Internet content by translating existing content into local languages; and 8. To build capacity through training programmes and regional workshops. The major outputs of the proposed project will be: 1. Locations of CeCs within the community have been identified; 2. Community needs have been identified;3. National initiatives, resources and services are identified;4. ICT applications and local content for local communities have been developed; 5. Operators of the centres have been identified; and6. CeCs will be equipped with hardware and required software to meet the needs of the community. B. Scope of the project, components, methodology and key activities Two CeCs will be established in each of Dhaka, Chittagong, Rajshahi, Khulna divisions and other CeCs will be established in each ofSylhet and Barisal divisions. Dhaka is the largest division. It has the largest population, rivers, and marshy lands. Chittagong has hilly areas and islands. Very often it facescyclones and tidal bores. Rajshahi is the second largest division in terms ofpopulation and area. Khulna has a sea-port and vast forest area. Barisal has alot of river and coastal area. Sylhet consists of hills and marshy lands. Communities and locations will be selected on the basis local needs. For this, a need assessment survey will be required. A consultant will beengaged for this purpose. Projects will be implemented on a pilot basis fortwo years. If the performance of these is found satisfactory, the programmemay be extended throughout the country. The project will have different components. First, the project area will be selected and a need assessment will be conducted by the international consultants with the help of local consultants. It will be carried out by a local survey, meetings with the local people, different government and non-Bangladesh158government organizations. Preference for setting up of the CeCs will be given to existing schools or local government organizations, so that students and therest of the community can jointly enjoy the facilities. During the needs assessment survey, operators will also be selected. After the needs assessment survey, local conferences and meetings will be held with the community andrecommendations from these meetings will be taken into consideration whendeveloping local content and during implementation. The operators will begiven skill development training and a study tour will be organized. C. Implementation arrangements The MOSICT will implement the project. A project director will be appointed by the Government. The expertise of the Bangladesh Computer Council (BCC) will be utilized in this project. At the top level, a project steering committee, headed by the Secretary, MOSICT, will oversee the project. A project technical committee, consisting of representatives of different technical organizations such as T&T Board, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). At the grass-roots level, a local managing committee, headed by the head of the local sub-district, will be formed to: (a) supervise the project and coordinate with the Project Director in implementing the project; and (b) monitor running and management of the centre. The operators will be selected from the locality. If schools are found suitable for establishing centres, preference may be given to school teachers or school staff for selection as operators. Existing school buildings will be used on a rental basis to avoid major construction work. A study tour will be conducted for the implementing team. The proposed project will be implemented on the basis of the recommendations of the consultants. The concerns and needs of local communities will also be taken into account. This will increase its sustainability as the community will be more prepared to pay for the services provided by the centre if they meet their needs. D. Cost and financing (US$) Item Qty .

Mahmudur Rahman, Assistant Chief, Economic Relations Division, Ministry of Finance Country: BangladeshDate: December 2004 I. INTRODUCTION Information and communications technology (ICT) may be consid- ered as the engine of the economy in any country. It can stronglycontribute to poverty reduction by enhancing income-generating opportuni-ties, including employment for poor people. Like other countries in South Asia, Bangladesh understands the reality and, consequently, the way for- ward to build an ICT-based society. It has been emphasized through theformation of a Task Force. The Prime Minister of Bangladesh, herself,chairs the Task Force to ensure the implementation of the activities takentowards building an ICT-based society. Bangladesh, like other developing countries, faces problems in ex- panding ICT to different parts of the country. Though it has experienced the benefit of ICT, it is limited to urban areas and rural areas are largelywithout coverage. In order to transfer technology and distribute the benefitof ICT to all parts of the country, the Bangladeshi Government plans tostart addressing the issue in an integrated manner. In addressing the issue, the project articulated here could be the first step. The project is planning to be implemented under the umbrella of Rural Development and Coopera-tives Division (RDCD), a Division of Ministry of Local Government, RuralDevelopment and Cooperatives, the Ministry of Science and Informationand Communications Technology (MOSICT) with the help of theBangladesh Computer Council. The Ministry of Post and Telecommunica- tions will implement the project along with the RDCD. The mandate of RDCD is to look after rural development activities in the country, whileMOSICT is responsible for ensuring capacity building of the nation in thefield of Information Technology (IT) and to attain a sustainable growth inthe ICT Sector of Bangladesh. The Ministry of Post and Telecommunica-tions is mainly involved in telecommunications infrastructure and postal services. The project has been designed to provide various services and the RDCD will coordinate all activities to be implemented under the project. II. BACKGROUND, ISSUES AND RATIONALE In Bangladesh, about 80 per cent of the population lives in rural areas, where a majority of the poor are also based. The poor lag behindeconomically and in terms of every opportunity. In order to address rural poverty, the Government is implementing several projects to reduce and alleviate poverty. In order to fulfill its constitutional obligations, theGovernment has been trying to build a poverty-free society since itsBangladesh16231The area will be selected on the geographical region and poverty situation of the country.independence. Despite all efforts, about half the population is below the poverty line, even at this moment. This is not because of illiteracy. It is because the large population engaged in agriculture including livestock andfisheries does not have better access to markets. They are not receiving the right price for their labour and products. There is a strong intermediary group making profit from this sector. The rich enjoy educational facilitiesmore than poor people. They also enjoy other facilities more. It has not been possible as yet to reach the rural poor with the modern technology. Tele-density in Bangladesh stands at only 2.9 per cent (mobile plus fixed line). Here, one thing is important - mobile lines have exceeded landlines, the ratio is 3.25:1. The use of ICT-based technologies is also less. For example, there are only 500,000 personal computers inBangladesh, and only 82,000 computers with Internet connection. The poor have only minimum access to these technologies. As a result they are less advanced, doing their job and business in a sub-modernway. They are deprived of modern education, modern health facilities and in turn living a sub-standard life. The Government therefore, has been targeting the rural poor to pull them out of the vicious cycle of poverty.The RDCD as mandated by the State is playing an important role in rural development. It has already taken the initiative to adopt technology with its ongoing efforts in poverty alleviation. This proposed project will be a revolutionary addition to the present initiatives, which will directly associ- ate the rural poor with the technology and will try to pull them out of thepoverty and make them sustainable. III. THE PROPOSED PROJECT The proposed project will target rural communities regardless of their income or wealth but give emphasize to the rural poor. The project isto set up community e-centres (CeCs) and has been designed to provideservices as much as possible to the rural areas. The services will be offeredaccording to the needs of the community. The goal of the project will be to examine the sustainability of CeCs that will bring sustainable economic growth and poverty alleviation in ruralareas of Bangladesh with the help of ICT. A. Purposes (or objectives) The main objectives of the project will be as follows: 1. To examine the degree of sustainability of CeCs in rural areas of Bangladesh; 2. To establish 20 pilot CeCs in different parts of the country 31; 3. To provide technology and ICT-based services;4. To provide selected primary consultancy services for filling out of different government application forms;Bangladesh1635. To keep birth and death record of selected areas; 6. To form of ICT user groups; and7. To train elder citizens of the society at night. The major outputs of the project would be as follows: 1. Critical regions are covered on a pilot basis for introducing ICT based services; 2. Rural population is more confident in production and marketing their product, and thereby profit more through the use of ICT; 3. Corruption in the public sector will be reduced;4. The cost of doing business will be reduced and therefore the profit will be higher that contributed to sustainability of small and medium enterprise (SME); 5. Public services will be available at the community level; and6. Economic activities be increased and income of rural people will be increased and thereby economic growth sees a positive impact. B. Scope of the project, components, methodology and key activities The project will cover 20 communities in different regions in Bangladesh. Through these communities the sustainability of the centres canbe tested over a two to three year period. Thereafter, the lessons learned from the pilot cases will be reviewed and a suitable model be designed to replicate. The priority areas will be selected according to the density of population.Here, different criteria will be applied. For six divisions, three rural areas fromDhaka, Chittagong and Khulna will be selected on low density and three ruralareas from Rajshahi, Barishal and Sylhet will be selected on high density. Theurban areas from six divisions will be selected in a reverse way. Other areas have been selected on the geographical nature of that region as geography has determined the density of population in those areas. The project will also test different areas of sustainability in order to prepare a sustainable model to be used in setting up CeCs across thecountry. Three approaches will be followed in addressing the ownership of the projects, they are: (a) solely government owned; (b) public-private ownership; and (c) a cooperative model. Private entrepreneurs interested insetting up a CeC will also be encouraged and the Government will givethem policy support, tax exemptions etc. The impact of those centres willalso be reviewed after two and half years. The project will have three different components. Firstly, a needs assessment will be done. An International Consultant will be deployed alongwith a local consultant to study the priority of selected areas. Considering the geographical importance, consultants can change the location of the proposed centres. Their recommendations will be reviewed and the govern-ment will make the final selection. After selection and finalization of the areas for implementation of the project, the consultants will do a survey for the needs assessment of the selected community. A baseline economic surveywill also be done during this period. It will take three months. During the survey, the exact location for the centre will be selected in consultation withBangladesh164local government bodies, civil society and other stakeholders. It will be located in an existing building, either a government or private building. During the needs assessment, CeC operators/volunteers/technicians will beselected from the selected communities by the community and government offices jointly and they will be trained for six months on different services to be provided by the centres. After the needs assessment survey, theconsultant will be deployed to assess sustainability issues with regard to financial/technological options. Thereafter the second component will be started. This is related to physical establishment of community e-centres. Tenders will be floated according to the needs of the centres. It will take about one month to purchase and install the equipment in those centres. During this work the local content will be created for certain areas. Contracts will be given to private firms through local competitive biddingto do this job. During this time, local conferences and workshops will be held in the selected areas. The recommendations of those workshops will be taken into consideration while implementing the project. The advertisingand awareness programme will be conducted during this period. On the sixth month, the centre will begin trial operation. From the seventh month the centre will start full-fledged operation. The third component will be the review of the sustainability of the centres. A joint mid-term review including local government bodies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) will be conducted on the perfor-mance after the centres complete 18 months of operation. An impact evaluation will be conducted to see the effectiveness and sustainability of the project. For this purpose, one local consultant and one internationalconsultant will be deployed. The consultants will assess the possibility of expansion of the project in a larger fashion throughout the country. A major consideration in implementing the project is community participation. If the community is not mobilized, the project will not be sustainable. Localization of product is also important. The services to be offered will be converted into local language within the shortest possibletime. Otherwise people may loose interest in using those services. There are some risks involved in using the computers and other facilities. People might be more interested in approaching new, private e-centres if one isopened near to presently located CeCs. In that case both centres will be turned to a losing concern. Another risk is that the Government may not be willing to subsidize the centres for a long period, and may tell thecommunity to take over the centres if they do not make profit. C. Implementation arrangements The project has been designed to be implemented on a pilot basis by the Government. The management may be different in different areas. Thedifferent types of management are: 1. Solely government owned, in which it may deploy its own people with some remuneration. In this case, monitoring will be the responsibility of the Government;Bangladesh1652. Public-private partnership, in which the Government provide equipment and connectivity, and the community manage the centre. The community take 35 per cent of the profit, 45 percent of the profit reserved for maintenance and recurring costs and the remaining 20 per cent go to the Government as it provides all the equipment free of charge; and 3. Cooperative association, in which cooperative association will manage day-to-day activities. The Government will provide space, equipment and connectivity as a loan to the cooperativeassociation. The cooperative association will run the e-centres on a commercial basis, and will pay back the loan on weekly basis. Operational costs and other recurrent costs will be borneby the cooperative association. In setting up of such centres, the Government may consider adoption of some regulatory policies. It may not need to pass a law in the Parliament; rather it can do it by issuing some office orders. The project duration will be four years. The executing agency of the project will be the RDCD. The Bangladesh Rural Development Board(BRDB), the MOSICT and its affiliated organization, Bangladesh Computer Council (BCC), and the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications (MOPT) will be the implementing agencies for the project. The MOSICT will equip the centre with necessary equipment, MOPT will arrange connectivity and BRDB will arrange funding for the e-centres. Three levels committee will monitor the project other than private sector. At the top there will be a Project Steering Committee (PSC). It willsee the progress and advise the project authority according to the need/ adjustment. It will meet every quarter. There will also be a Technical Committee consisting of members from directly related agencies. A LocalLevel Committee consisting of local government and community representa- tives shall monitor the day-to-day project activities. D.

Sustainability, viability and expected impact The services to be offered will be selected based on the need of the community and that will of course ensure the market of the CeCs. The second point for sustainability is related to the fees/charges taken from the customers. The services for local content and other information may charge in a judicious way. So, the centres will be able to generate income to cover the day-to-day operational cost. But, here the critical issue is the investment cost needed for establishing the centres. Here the advantage of the centres will be that they will get government support in different forms. Tax exemption for equipment will make their investment cost less than any other project run by private sector. Tax Holiday advantage and lower rate of electricity and lower interest rate will also make the proposed centres sustainable. However, the mishandling of the centres may create new problems for the poor. This problem can be minimized with the help of local government institutions, local leaders and by the community itself. The user group can also be pressure group.Bangladesh Project framework Design summaryPerformanceMonitoring mechanisms Assumptions and risksindicators/targets Goal To examine how ICT- based CeCs help reduce poverty and minimizethe digital divideImproved community-based ICT infrastructure in 20communities by 2009 andpoor people are usingthose technologies Increased income for agriculture producers Reduce gap between the urban and rural poor in20 communitiesVisual inspection Beneficiary opinionStatistical reports Independent poverty impact assessment Project evaluation reportGovernment/ cooperative/ItemQty. localDonors Total cost community 4.

INTRODUCTION Information and communications technologies (ICT) have played a vital role in the development of rural communities around the globe.Recent developments in ICT have cut cost of technology substantially, andhave increased the effective range of communication equipments makingthem ideal for a country like Bhutan. WiMax, Power Line Communications,and cheap satellite communications are some of the recent developments. The Royal Government of Bhutan, through its incumbent telecom operator, Bhutan Telecom, has set out on a noble quest to provide communi- cation connectivity to all 201 blocks within the country by 2007. Further, theMinistry of Information and Communications, noting the importance of\"access to information\" for economic and social development, has startednumerous pilot telecentre projects to determine the best approach to commu-nity e-centres (CeCs) for Bhutan: the Department of Information Technology has started three telecentre pilot studies in eastern Bhutan putting the lessons learned from an earlier telecentre pilot carried out in Jakar Bumthang; andBhutan Post is developing 17 public kiosks to study the effectiveness of e-post. This proposal seeks to take the previously mentioned initiatives to the next level, by consolidating all the lessons learned from the pilotstudies and further incorporating the best practices of international andregional initiatives. II. BACKGROUND, ISSUES AND RATIONALE Bhutan, lying in the Eastern Himalayas, is a country of mountains and rivers with 79 per cent of its population still surviving solely onagricultural production. Due to the mountainous nature of the land, rural dwellers have created small pockets of settlements which range from a few hundred households down to even a single household. The Royal Government of Bhutan finds it extremely difficult to gather enough funds to invest in such regions due to extreme costs required for development in such regions and also due to the low impacts of suchventures. Imagine establishing a school costing hundreds of thousands of dollars for only 50 children, or building a 100 kilometres mountain road that reaches only 100 households. Even so, the Royal Government of Bhutan is slowly pumping enormous funds for the development of these regions by building feeder roads (that giveaccess to a number of villages), community schools and basic health units every year. Even so the rate at which development is taking place leaves a major portion of the population waiting for motorable roads, better health care,Bhutan172easier access to education, seamless connectivity to communication networks, and in general, the ability to have better quality of life. Due to this unavoidable fact, there is a major segment of the population that is less empowered, and has a lesser quality of life as compared to the 21 per cent urban dwellers. This has sadly created a society of \"haves\", and \"havenots\", in a country that believes in \"Gross National Happiness\". Noticing the rapid widening gap of development between the urban and rural population, the younger generations from rural communities fail to return to their communities further displacing vital skilled human resources from the communities and, in addition, creating a steady rise in rural to urban migration. To mitigate this problem, the Royal Government of Bhutan has started decentralization - empowering local governments so that development takes place in an even manner in all the 20 districts within Bhutan. Realizing theimportance of communications for development, the Royal Government of Bhutan has announced that \"all 201 blocks within the country will have access to at least 10 telecommunication lines by the end of 2007\". ICT can also be a means to overcome these barriers, if not totally, to a great degree. The cost of ICTs has dropped substantially, while at the sametime their effectiveness has increased in leaps and bounds. The Royal Government of Bhutan understands the vital role that ICT can play in the development of rural communities, and has already launched few pilotcommunity e-centres around the country. Though the desire is to have at least one pilot study for each unique settlement within the country, lack of funds has forced the pilot studies to be limited to a very few in few selected locations. III. THE PROPOSED PROJECT A. Purposes (or objectives) The goal of this project is to \"empower rural Bhutan and create a knowledge base on CeCs for the global community\" using ICT as a means. The objectives of this project will be: To gather vital information of successful models of CeCs for all unique types of community settlements within the country To develop a knowledge resource centre based on the aboveresearch and make it available (online/offline) for all countrieswith similar situations The outputs of this project will be: Globally accessible knowledge base of case studies of successful CeC initiatives based in Bhutan Self sustained CeCs managed entirely by the community Training programmes developed and institutionalized in locallanguages Heightened awareness about the benefits that can be gainedfrom ICT in rural communities B. Scope of the project, components, methodology and key activities The project will work with selected local rural communities of a unique nature (in terms of accessibility, population density and proximity toBhutan173urban areas) in Bhutan. The scope of the project in terms of benefits is broader as the results will be available online to a global audience. Themethodology of the project is to diversify the different types of CeCs tocome up with best approaches to different community settings withinBhutan and further to share that knowledge with a global audience. The key activities include: 1. Determining different categories of communities in Bhutan; 2. Determining the best CeC approach for each category of com- munity; and 3. Making the research data available online for a global audience. Considering the huge costs involved in the development of CeCs throughout the country, a pilot-based implementation of eight centres willbe carried out. A general survey will be carried out to determine similarities be- tween different communities throughout Bhutan. This will help determinethe different categories of rural settlements that exist, and will be used to determine the different types of centres to pilot. A single community of each type will be selected keeping in mind the following criteria: (1) The settlement has the highest population withinthat category of settlements; (2) categories of CeCs will not exceed eight numbers; and (3) preferably located near a school. A team of survey people composing of one international consultant will visit the selected communities to carry out a comprehensive survey to determine the needs of the settlements. Once determined, services will be designed based on the findings of the survey. Along with that, training mechanisms, andawareness schemes will be developed. Trainings will be conducted before and during the implementation so as to be effective. Trainings will include but not be limited to: hardware maintenance, software operations, Internet use,knowledge management, and basic business management. Awareness schemes will include pre-designed video clip and graphical brochures. After the services have been rolled out in the eight communities, bi- annual evaluation surveys will be carried out to study the progress and improvements required within the community. Further, ad hoc response teams will visit sites that face economic or technical problems and willdetermine solutions if possible. The response team will try alternative combination of services, and if the problem persists, that initiative will be dropped, taking note of the reasons why the initiative failed. According to the experiences of many CeCs initiatives around the world, it takes about five years to mature. Since this is a pilot study, the project will run for three years. This will include the time, starting from conducting the surveys till information website is published. The actual research periodwould be for about two years. Once it has been determined that a CeC is functional and operates without any financial or technical problems for one year, the data collected on that CeC will be compiled. This would be the casefor all other pilot CeCs. The compiled research of all successful CeCs within this project will then be published on a website accessible to all.Bhutan174Item Government Donors Total cost 1. Consultants a.

Implementation arrangements The main agency implementing this project will be the Ministry of Information and Communications, which is the main organization within the Government overseeing all ICT (including media) developmental activities. Since the project entails major training and human resource develop- ment components, it would be advantageous to involve the Ministry of Education. This Ministry is the main body which looks after education within Bhutan and has in place infrastructure and logistics for non-formal education for the rural sector. This would be ideal for the project. From past experiences of CeCs around the world, it has been witnessed that CeCs are generally successful in cases where a previous network already exists, and the CeCs are superimposed over them. There- fore, to take advantage of that knowledge, and also because agricultural development is primarily looked after by the Ministry of Agriculture, it would be wise to include them in the project. Lastly, but not the least, have the Ministry of Home and Cultural Affairs, being the main body looking after rural development, administra- tion units in place in all the blocks will be a major benefit for the successful implementation of the project.

INTRODUCTION Eighty five per cent of the population live in rural areas and 80 per cent of Cambodia's workforce is employed in the agricultural sector. The Ministry of Rural Development (MRD) works to improve the social andeconomic wellbeing of rural populations in Cambodia. The rural develop- ment approach adopted by the Royal Government of Cambodia is based on partnerships and cooperation in development. This encompasses cooperationbetween the government (line ministries and local authorities), international organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the private sector, community organizations and the rural people. 32 It is with this approach in mind that this proposal has been developed. The project is a joint effort between MRD, SilkRoad Cambodia (SRC), the Asia Foundation (TAF) and its network of local NGO partners. It is presented as an example of how government, NGOs and the privatesector can work effectively to harness the potential that ICT presents for development projects. SRC worked with the Asia Foundation on the Community Information Centre (CIC) project providing monitoring and evaluation of the technicalsupport of the local NGOs. TAF is exploring how to build on the success of their CIC project. Both organizations believe that ICT is best used as a tool to achieve development objectives. As the Ministry of Rural Development isdevelopment driven, it was a natural partnership. This project aims to provide leadership and initiative, to link relevant partners, and the strategic use of limited resources to bring benefits to rural Cambodians. II. BACKGROUND, ISSUES AND RATIONALE As a least developed country, Cambodia is ripe for the potential that ICT can bring to rural development. The e-ASEAN (Association of South-east AsianNations) Readiness Assessment in 2001 classified Cambodia as an \"emerging\" e-readiness country and ranked eighth out of the 10 ASEAN countries in terms of e-infrastructure, e-society, e-commerce and e-government. 33 32Ministry of Rural Development. Second Five-Year Socio-Economic Development Plan, 2001-2005. 33e-ASEAN Readiness Assessment, 2001 http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/docu-ments/APCITY/UNPAN007625.pdfCambodia177A number of other international organizations, multilateral agencies and NGOs such as the United Nations, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) haveconducted research into the adoption of ICT in Cambodia. 34 The ITU study of the Khmer Internet in 200235 placed Cambodia's e-readiness as embryonic and that it will still take a while before the rest of the country is connected. Witha population of an estimated 13 million, there are 800,000 mobile phone subscribers which accounts for 81 per cent compared to only 14 per cent for fixed-line. The majority of these connections are in the capital and this splitbetween urban and rural is paralleled by educated and uneducated, affluent and poor, illustrating how in a country with 85 per cent of the population living in rural areas, the gap between information rich and poor is still a significantissue. It is within this context that this project proposal is developed. III. THE PROPOSED PROJECT In considering how best to use limited resources and still achieve best outcomes, the project team proposes that this project starts with the Ministry of Rural Development. Given the vast number of Cambodians living in rural areas, this Ministry is ideally positioned to have the mostsignificant impact on the micro-level. The model proposed uses the existing structure of a selected ministry to scale up the activities to a national level focusing on decentralization, deconcentration and institutional strengthening.In doing so, this project model can be successfully transferred and adapted to other ministries, eventually ensuring that all Cambodian government ministries have effective rural development programmes through utilizingICT to connect and communicate. TAF has been the most active in the field of community e-centres (CeCs) in Cambodia supporting the establishment of 22 provincial CICs, (PormeanSahakum in Khmer) across Cambodia. As the largest ICT project in Cambodia to date, the CICs aim to provide a public space for local members of the community to access news and information and to communicate with people outside of theirimmediate community. Located in provincial capitals, the CICs are providing residents outside Phnom Penh an alternative source of information. 36 This proposal aims to build on the successful provincial project and acknowledgesthat the CICs are in fact a pilot for any rural ICT project in Cambodia. As such, TAF and their local NGO partners are integral to successfully expanding ICTs and establishing the Chunnaboth-net Rural Information Centres. A. Purposes (or objectives) Goal: Support and enhance the activities of MRD to increase the wellbeing of rural communities through effective use of information and communication. 34USAID ICT Assessment, 2001 35ITU e-Readiness Assessment, 2002. http://www.itu.int/asean2001/documents/pdf/Docu- ment-30.pdf 36Internet access on wheels knowledge to Cambodia's poor communities. Alecks P. Pabico http://www.pcij.org/imag/Technology/cambodia.htmlCambodia178Objectives: In order to improve the effectiveness of MRD programmes this project aims to: Promote the benefit of information to stakeholders Identify and provide relevant information and communication channels Create linkages to exchange information amongst stakeholders Develop skills of MRD staff to best meet the information and communication needs of their programmes Improve communication channels both vertical and horizontalamongst stakeholders Capture and share the expert knowledge within MRD anddisseminate amongst stakeholders B. Scope of the project, components, methodology and key activities This project aims to improve and develop basic services as recom- mended in the recent Asian Development Bank (ADB) assessment of needs,readiness and possibilities in Cambodia conducted in June 2004. 37 Commu- nity outreach is a core objective of the project in order to educate rural populations of the benefit of access to information and communication channels. Specifically the project aims to promote ICT among Community-based Organizations (CBO) such as self-help groups, fertilizer banks, ricebanks and farmer associations. Involving these target populations is critical in expanding both vertical and horizontal information and communication flows. Key toachieving this is primary research on the information needs of these communities and the preferred methods of communication: oral, written, aural or visual. Allowing for flexibility of content delivery will ensure theeffectiveness of MRD programmes. Posters, radio and comic books are alleffective information, education, communication materials that are currentlyutilized in MRD programmes such as HIV/AIDS and sanitation. Thisproject aims to transfer these materials to digital format to maximize reach of vital information that directly impacts on rural livelihoods. The proposed project is nationwide with the aim to link the MRD at central, provincial, district and community levels across Cambodia. Takinglessons learned from the CIC project, initial Rural Information Centres willbe established in all districts of one province as the first phase. Onceissues are identified and problems solved, nationwide roll out will beundertaken. Consideration of scale suggests that the target province may be Pailin or Svay Rieng. A key success factor of this project is the identifica- tion and inclusion of a variety of stakeholders. At the start of the project, athorough stakeholder identification and needs analysis will be conducted toensure that the project meets their information and communication needs. This project poses two key components - access and content. 37Bestle, Lars H. (2004) \"Improving basic social service delivery with ICTs in rural areas of the Mekong Region\", conducted for the ADB.Cambodia1791.Infrastructure /access To meet this infrastructure challenge, this proposal recommends developing partnerships between government and the private sector in orderto expand connectivity outside of the provincial capitals. The predominant technology connecting Cambodia is wireless. Given the current success of such wireless technology, it is proposed that this be the focus of any ruralexpansion of ICTs. TAF worked in partnership with local Internet serviceprovide (ISP) Telesurf to test new technologies in geographically remoteareas of Cambodia. It is this partnership that this project seeks to build onto expand ICT connectivity to rural Cambodians. MRD ICT infrastructure: Establish ICT system for MRD with a centre (hub) in Phnom Penh as the main server, which will share informa-tion to target communities country wide Purchase and install equipment for all departments in MRDat central, provincial and district level offices Chunnaboth-net rural information centres: Establish Rural Information Centres in the District Office of Rural Development locations or other negotiated locations such as schools or district health services Infrastructure set up using wireless technology. Equipmentincludes: computers, printer, photocopier and scanner Develop management and service provision framework inconsultation with TAF to learn from CIC experience to ensure relevance and sustainability Capacity building and training programme: Develop and conduct local language training programmes on ICTs for relevant stakeholders including: MRD staff at pro-vincial and district levels The capacity building would also focus on the staff of theMRD IT department to operate and monitor the ICT system. Specifically to promote the capacity building and train the local Chunnaboth-net staff 2.Content and delivery The other component of the project is content in the form of an online rural-net \"Chunnaboth-net\" which focuses on relevant, timely andlocal language content. Based on a user-centred design, the informationstructure would require users to identify who they are in order to best present the information most relevant. Key to this will be the establishment of a centralized web presence for the MRD who has to date been unable to securefunding despite two feasibility studies being conducted. The Department ofPlanning and Public Relations is ideally placed to manage the MRD websitehowever they would require training and support. This is a core activity ofthis project for without the centralized repository of information on rural development, any decentralized activity will be lacking.Cambodia180Currently Cambodia has a number of other ICT focused initia- tives such as the Government Administrative Information system (GAIS) administered by National Information Communications Technology Devel-opment Authority (NiDA) and the Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning, and Construction (MLMUPC) is also working on a land registra- tion database. This project aims to provide the linkages to these otherprogrammes through the MRD site, CICs and Chunnaboth-net. The rural access points created as part of this project will also create a vital link between rural communities and centralized government activities. The MRDwill also work to increase coordination with other line ministries. A nationwide marketing campaign needs to be devised and implemented to promote the various elements of this project such as the access point locations, content availability, and benefits of information for rural communities and provincial departments. This could take the form ofposters, radio advertising, workshops and education programmes for schools. C. Implementation arrangements The project will be under the leadership of MRD who will oversee the project and involve their network of MRD staff from its vertical structure, both centrally and in provincial and district levels: ProvincialDepartment of Rural Development (PDRD) and District Office of Rural Development (DORD). In particular the proposed entry point for expanding rural access is to DORD across Cambodia. TAF, as the leading NGO working in ICT in Cambodia, will function as the capacity building and supporting agency through their network onCICs. TAF's CIC network is made up of six local NGOs who currently operate the CICs in 22 provincial capitals. It is this focus on local partnership that will bring strength to the expansion of ICT services into rural Cambodia. SRC, as a leading ICT consulting firm, will provide inputs in design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the project. Throughtheir network of ICT consultants, SRC has expertise in the areas of planning, project management and technical installation of ICT projects in developing countries, in particular Cambodia and Viet Nam.

Sustainability, viability and expected impact The value of CeCs is their network effect which enables communi- ties to connect, create and share value. The key value proposition of theproposed Rural Information Centres (RICs) and ICT for rural development in Cambodia is twofold: access and content. These need to be developed in partnership ensuring both the physical and virtual needs are harnessed touse ICT to enable development in Cambodia.Cambodia Project framework Design summaryPerformanceMonitoring mechanisms Assumptions and risksindicators/targets Goal Increase well being of rural community through effective use of ICT through MRD programmesMRD programmes have increased impact in achieving their development objectivesSurveys/questionnaires Report/statisticsContinued stability and support of the Royal Government of Cambodia to achieve MRD objectives PurposePromote the benefit of information to stakeholders with an aim to improve rural development Support and improve the effectiveness of MRD programmes Capture and share the expert knowledge withinMRD and disseminateamongst stakeholdersIncreased range of relevant information available Increased access to ICT infrastructure in order to disseminate information and communicate with stakeholders Knowledge is captured and shared amongst MRD staffand stakeholderInformation needs assessment Knowledge management audit Surveys/base line data comparisons of MRD programmesCommunity info needs MRD willingness to share knowledge develop content Lack of support from line ministry Private sector support Affordable technology Outputs Effective MRD ICTimplementation nationwide Effective Rural InformationCentres established andworking in 260 districtoffices of rural developmentImproved service deliveryto rural communities Broader public participation in MRD programmes Availability of MRD services obtained at RICSurveys to assess impact Monitoring reports Programme reports Stakeholder feedbackKnowledge auditHard to coordinate between line ministry Capacity of RIC staff Low education, literacy levels of rural population Harnessing community supportItemGovernment/Donors Total costcommunity 4.

INTRODUCTION Information and communications technologies (ICT) are playing an increasingly important role in Cambodia. Although the country variesgreatly in its readiness to use ICT and infrastructure in the country is not so good, all sectors have embarked on the development of ICT as a tool for business and education. In particular, many ministries, non-governmentaland private organizations across the country are looking to e-learning as a tool for capacity building to respond to its need. Community e-centres have been developed in many locations and there is great potential for thesecentres to help deliver high-quality information to the community. II. BACKGROUND, ISSUES AND RATIONALE There are currently more than 30 universities and institutes in Cambodia, mostly in Phnom Penh. Since new technology is a preconditionfor most employment, almost all are taking computer related courses suchas e-mail use, Internet Explorer, word processing and spreadsheet design,programming and the like which cover basic to advanced knowledge of computers. Since there is a demand, all university and education institutions are offering computer related courses from application usage to program-ming. Unfortunately, there are currently very few telecom centres in rural areas due to the lack of a backbone network from the city to the rural areas.Most people in the rural area are farmers and they need up-to-date information on market prices and information. However, most government web sites are in English and aimed at the foreign community. Providing needed information inlocal languages should be done as a matter of urgency in order to attractinterest to the Internet and create a reason for using it. In addition, connectionbetween ministries, municipalities, districts and communities are done viafibre optic. Fixed line services are provided mainly by the Ministry of Post and Telecommunication (MPTC). The network has a maximum switching capacity of approximately 30,000 lines, but currently it has only about 25,000subscribers because of limitation imposed by the copper access network. Recognizing the importance of ICT, the MPTC has requested a loan from the Government of Japan and the Greater Mekong Backbone Network Project has been designed in order to establish a telecommunications centre in the provinces as well as to extend ICT services throughout the country.Cambodia184E. Sustainability, viability and expected impact This project is viable and will be sustainable since the project is not to build something new. Rather the strength of the project lies in adding value to existing activities. Improving the impact of research will bringmore work opportunities to people in the provinces and this will clearly bea benefit of this project. Firstly, the project will improve community skills in ICT. Secondly, people will receive training on specific aspects of information management and communication skills. Difficulties in extending knowledge prevents peoplein rural areas obtaining information that they need to improve their lives. The new information technology will be transferred to all throughout the country. People in the provinces will be able to access more information, faster, and will be better able to use information to improve their lives.Item Government Donor Total cost 1. Consultants a.

INTRODUCTION The Chinese Government reckons that \"IT application is a logical choice if industrialization and modernization of our country are to be accelerated\", and takes stimulating IT application as the main task for the first 20 year economic development and reform in 21 st century. IT applica- tion in agriculture is a major part in IT applications to national economy.Therefore, a series of policies have been worked out to stimulate ITapplications in agriculture. The importance of rural market informationsystem was stressed in \"10th Five-Year Plan (2001-2005) for National Economic and Social Development\". China Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) initiated \"10th Five-Year Action Plan for improving rural market informa-tion system\" in 2001. In 2002, MOA released \"Directive of extendingmarket information system and human resource development for improvingrural information services\". Under the direction of these policies, Chinarural information services have developed rapidly. Since 2001, MOA has started to overcome the low information penetration to farmers. It is called the \"last one kilometre problem\".Currently, agricultural information management and service institutions havebeen set up in all county, prefecture, provincial and national agriculturaladministratives. Forty-seven per cent of township governments have estab-lished information service centres. Currently, there are nearly 3,000 agricultural web sites in China. Most of them are owned by public service units, research institutes,agricultural universities, Internet enterprises, as well as private companies.Their content provisions normally focus on specific products, e.g. flowers,tea, poultry, pig raising, fruit and vegetable production. The users aremainly extentionists, brokers, processors, farmers' technical associations. These Internet content providers (ICPs) have formulated their own annual forum and developed their business well. II. BACKGROUND, ISSUES AND RATIONALE It is no doubt that the building of e-community is facing many challenges in rural China. The foremost issue is lack of knowledge manage- ment experience. Most of agricultural ICPs in China are more likelyfocused on similar information. Some of them are too theoretical or onlyrelease their research achievements. Some of them are too general to beused in practical production and rural social needs. Farmers need to findpractical \"know-how\" techniques for farm management such as pest/weedsChina187control, fertilization methods, environment resource protection, harvest stor- age, proper market and marketing methods. Good agricultural knowledgemanagement in proper ICPs is key to solving this issue. Currently, it is necessary to diversify the ICPs' services. The second issue is that China lacks human resources for running community e-centres (CeCs), especially at the township level. Currently, most rural information trainings are mainly for computer skills - positive organiza- tion or management skills are seldom taught. From this view, even as government increases its inputs to build up CeCs, it will be difficult to be sustainable and is not economical. To use participatory method to train trainers and set up pilot projects is a practical measure for solving this problem. The third is that financial input is mainly from government: the agitation and motivation mechanism for NGO and involvement of the private sector are weak. Therefore, it is important to help and introduce non-government organizations (NGOs) and the private sector to participate in building CeCs in rural China. The fourth issue is that China is still lack of a proper infrastructure for Internet connection in rural areas. Finally, China lacks experience in building rural CeCs. It will be very helpful to improve substantial international cooperation and exchange the experiences with other countries. III. THE PROPOSED PROJECT A. Purposes (or objectives) In order to improve the information service efficiency, establish a practical mechanism for running a sustainable rural e-community, and toincrease CeC development in rural China, it is necessary to achieve the following: 1. Improve ICPs' knowledge management capability substantially in China; 2. Organize regularly, two different types of training for trainer courses - ICP knowledge management training and rural infor-mation service manager training; and 3. Set up pilot CeCs for rural development in China through international cooperation. The project duration is four years. The estimated outputs are:1. A national platform, which can provide linkages to main portals for building multipurpose rural CeCs, is developed. This plat- form could supervise all county centres to build their owndownstream CeCs, especially in pilot counties. It can hence lead a national experience exchange platform; 2. Sixty pilot rural CeCs are set up that can be used for training and providing work place for volunteers, with and 10 of them are especially for HIV/AIDs prevention;China1883. Seventy government ICPs and 20 large non-government ICPs are trained to setup knowledge management system; 4. Three hundred ICP information managers and 300 volunteers are trained; 5. Six hundred local information service managers are trained; and 6. Trained volunteers can work in selected township information service centres for one year and train 50 local trainees. B. Scope of the project, components, methodology and key activities 1.To develop a national rural e-community platform To develop a good platform for both government and non- government shareholders using browser-web server-database server (B/S)technology. The shareholders of the project are mainly from government,NGOs as well as private ICPs. 2.To build pilot rural community e-centres It is suggested that the pilot project is mainly for upgrading 60 township level centres according to the current development situations. Thereplaced apparatus can be used to equip village level centres. This is morepractical and suits to the local situations in rural China. The centres shouldhave the following functions: Provide stable access to the Internet, and the national rurale-centre platform Provide comprehensive information services: specially have the capability of organizing \"information market\", that pro- vide intensive services every 15 days through distributing\"hard form\" information materials Supervise village information services, and organize trainingfor village level information service people Conduct information needs survey and collect feedback in- formation on national rural e-community platform It is suggested that the centres for HIV/AIDs prevention be established by the Ministry of Health, or expand this project to a larger oneto cover this area. 3.To organize different type of training courses It is essential to provide comprehensive and easy-to-use informa- tion to farmers through community e-centres. Therefore, building capacity ofthe future ICPs should be strengthened. To use strong international expertise will be a good choice in this aspect. The best way is to organize training courses for large ICPs on agricultural information service. These trainees arenormally well educated and it is essential to make them understand themethodology of knowledge management and to teach them how to organizetheir information. Different training courses need to be organized fordifferent types of trainees in order to improve exchange of experiences.China189ICP information managers or volunteers are mainly trained by the trainer trainees with the assistance from domestic experts. It can be divided into five specific training courses and held simultaneously. Another level of training is for grassroot trainer trainees. The trainer trainees will be from county or township information service centres or volunteers. The main task for this kind of training course is to provide a basic computer skills, and more importantly, train them on how to manage their services, training local trainees, and identifying local information needs. 4.Development of software Besides the national platform, it is necessary to develop e- learning applications and databases. The databases may include: knowledge bank for sustainable development, land management, animal immune, book and VCD order system, special product online promotion system, labour force registration system and information survey system. The development can be carried out jointly by government and non-government ICPs. C. Implementation arrangements The Department of International Cooperation of MOA will be respon- sible for the coordination of the project. It is suggested that the centres for HIV/AIDs prevention be established by the Ministry of Health, or to formulate a larger project. The implementation phase is four years. Training for ICPs and project managers should be conducted in the first year, together with the purchasing and installation of the equipments and necessary software. Training for volunteers will be carried out in the second year. MOA will organize annual seminars jointly with NGOs. The midterm and final evaluation of the project will be carried out by the end of the second project year and the end of the forth year respectively. During the last year of the project, it is suggested to organize an international conference on rural CeCs in China. D. Cost and financing (US$) The total cost estimate is around US$ 1.07 million. For technical assistance, the Government will cover the cost of local accommodation and domestic travel arrangement; the donors will provide fees for both interna- tional as well as local experts. Generally, organizing training courses and seminars can be done by the Government, while the organization of an international conference will be done by the international organizations. Government at different level will be responsible for the substantial construction of buildings of 60 rural CeCs. Donors will be asked to input to servers, PCs, Internet connection apparatus, multimedia equipments and B/S platform development. Chinese institutions involved in the project will carry out research on CeCs impact on farmers in terms of marketing and resource manage- ment, and conduct offline or online survey to identify information needs.China190And it is a good way to set up a joint research with donors.

Sustainability, viability and expected impact It is obvious that building CeCs in rural China can gain benefits: 1. The project will cover ICPs from the very beginning for the information services. It will lead an information diversificationfrom the source; the farmers will have more choices of using the information. 2. Different CeCs will share a common platform, formulating a virtual rural community through the Internet. The exchange of experiences and lessons learned will be more quick and direct, and this may bring big changes to farmers in their communica-tion and community life. 3. Training both ICPs and grassroot trainees will increase the number of people working for rural CeCs, forming the newforce for agricultural extension, and will change the traditional agricultural marketing ways and learning habits. 4.

INTRODUCTION The establishment of community e-centres (CeCs) in Fiji is a key sector policy for the development of rural and outer islands and the information andcommunication technology (ICT) services stated in the Strategic Development Plan 2003-2005. From this broad framework, a National ICT Development Policy formulated by the Ministry of Information and Communication (MIC)was endorsed in July 2004 to realize three strategic outcomes focused on: (1) e-government (government online); (2) e-business (or e-commerce); and (3) e- community (or community e-empowered). Although the National ICT Development Policy has now been adopted as the guiding document for the ICT industry, a few telecentres have already been established under the \"Putting people online strategy\" ofthe Department of Information Technology and Computing Services' (ITCS) E-government Strategy Plan (EGSP) 39 2003-2005. The MIC is currently realigning the EGSP to the National ICT Development Policy. The National ICT Development Policy outlines the strategies, key result areas and action items of the three \"Es\" stated above. The setting upof telecentres falls under the overall e-community strategy of \"Affordable Universal Access aligned with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and WSIS Declaration of Principles and Plan of Actions\". The related key result areas include: (1) increase access via physical connectivity for allcitizens; and (2) Internet access to all educational institutes. In order to realize the e-community strategy and the relevant key result areas above, the action items to be undertaken include: (1) theprovision of at least 400 more villages by 2005; (2) an additional 10 schools per year with computers and Internet access; (3) community access through library centres and centres of excellence; and (4) the provision of agovernment subsidy for rural connectivity, Fiji TV and satellite link. This provides the basis for this proposed action plan to strategically formulate an e-Community Development Plan (ECDP) outlining a pipelineof CeC projects in the rural areas based on the opportunities and develop- ments taking place in those areas. 39The e-Government Strategy Plan (EGSP) was designed exclusively by ITC under an ADB technical assistant well before the endorsement of the National ICT DevelopmentPolicy in July 2004.Fiji194II. BACKGROUND, ISSUES AND RATIONALE Fiji has good economic potential in mining, fishing, forestry and agriculture. These industries are rural based and provide a great potential forfuture development and prosperity. However, the major impediments are: (1)poor access to markets in many rural areas and low participation of ruralpopulation in the national economy; (2) remoteness and sparse scatter of islandsspread over 500,000 square kilometres of ocean; (3) shortage of skilled human resources; and (4) limited transport, power and communication infrastructure serving the small and widely dispersed population of about 820,000. Among the services mentioned under item four above is the problem of limited access to IT facilities in the rural areas. The significance of thisproblem is due to four major reasons: High cost of Internet connectivity - The relatively high Internet access charges from the monopoly ISP High cost of computer hardware and software - The F$ 2,500 (US$ 1,250 package costs of personal computer, printerand Internet access is still too high for most Fijian families.Some families don't even have telephones Absence of ICT in schools - Most schools do not have computer labs, and if they do, only very few have Internet access that is slow and expensive Lack of awareness and training on ICT - The common conservative attitude the Fijian society has is that ICT is notrelevant nor is the education of ICT important. Therefore noteveryone is proficient with ICT in Fiji as a majority could notafford to pay for training on the use of ICT In the past, not much has been done to address the limited access to IT facilities in the rural areas. However, a lot of effort has been put in bygovernment to provide the pre-requisite infrastructure services that wouldenable increased IT access to the rural areas. This includes the provision of rural fisheries and market centres for marine and agricultural products; access to a reliable supply of electricity through the subsidized ruralelectrification programme and the Rural Telecommunications programme fortelephone and Internet connectivity. As of to date about 60 per cent of thetotal number of rural villages already have access to a reliable source ofelectricity and the basic telephone network. This provides a strong founda- tion for setting up rural telecentres aimed at closing the information gap and empowering the rural population for sustainable livelihood. III. THE PROPOSED PROJECT A. Purposes (or objectives) The overall goal of this project is to improve the enabling environ- ment for economic growth and poverty reduction in the rural areas. The main purposes of this project are to: Increase reliable and affordable access to ICT services in se- lected rural areas of FijiFiji195Improve access to agricultural, fisheries and forestry markets and information To achieve these objectives, this project specifically proposes the setting up of multi-purpose community telecentres in rural and outer islandcommunities consisting of personal computers, local area networking, a phoneand Internet connection, appropriate content and training per telecentre. Theproject is an attempt to rationalize the fragmented approach to the establish-ment of CeCs in Fiji, by identifying all existing and potential CeCs in a central ECDP document that would be updated annually to achieve the overall e- community strategy in the National ICT Development Policy (NICTDP) andthe key performance indicators in the SDP 2003-2005. Other associated means that would achieve these objectives have been currently addressed by government such as phasing out the monopoly status of the Internet Service Provider, provision of tax incentives for suppliers of computer hardware and software and the provision of Internetlibraries for school children under the EGSP 2003-2005. B. Scope of the project, components, methodology and key activities The project mainly covers the rural maritime and inland areas and targets those areas where opportunities for further development exist suchas agriculture, fisheries and forestry. The approach proposed to achieve theexpected output consists of three essential steps: 1. A survey and analysis on pilot CeCs in Fiji and information needs of the rural population focusing on agricultural farmers and fishermen; 2. Costing and design of e-centres to be replicated; and3. Implementation. The key activities associated with the above methodology include: 1. Identification of suitable and strategic locations of all proposed telecentres in rural Fiji based on opportunities available in thoseareas, the activeness of the community, and the current status of access to regular electricity supply and telephone connectivity; 2. Costing and design of identified CeCs to be replicated;3. Ranking of identified CeCs for implementation;4. Funding of proposed projects based on consultations among stakeholders (government, Telecom Fiji Limited (TFL), Depart-ment of ITCS and other interested financiers); and 5. Implementation. The key assumptions and risks of this methodology for consideration include: 1. Some of the identified rural areas may have access to electricity but the capacity may only allow them to use limited electricalappliances. Other alternatives must be developed to ensure areliable electricity supply to the identified areas; 2. Funding maybe a risk if any of the co-financiers pull out; and 3. Insufficient IT personnel for implementation on a national scale.Fiji196C. Implementation arrangements The Department of ITCS will be the project's main executing agency. The Director of ITCS will be responsible for overall project management. The National Planning Office and the Ministry of FijianAffairs and Regional Development will assist in the identification andranking of telecentre projects to be implemented. No international consultancy will be required as technical inputs are available domestically through ITCS and other reputable IT consultants. The project will be implemented over the period specified in line with thetotal number of rural CeCs identified from the survey. In terms of dissemination of the project outputs, the two pilot CeCs projects are currently being monitored and evaluated as a basis for duplica- tion in other rural locations. This will continue as an ongoing process with a view to improve the implementation and service content for futuretelecentre projects in the rural areas. ITCS will provide the ADB and the Government with quarterly progress reports concerning financial aspects of the project, the design and installation. At the end of each year, ITCS will provide review reports of the telecentres set up during the year and will advise the ADB on anyprogress achieved in addressing the issues described in Part II. D. Cost and financing The total cost of the project in the first year is approximately US$ 0.75m (F$1.5m) broken down as follows: Project componentGovernment ADB T otal (US$ million) (US$ million) (US$ million) Survey, Costing and Design 0.00 0.50 0.50 Implementation 0.25*0.00 0.25 Total 0.25 0.50 0.75 *Cost to be finalized from the surveyFiji It is proposed that ADB fund the survey, costing and design while the Government funds the implementation of the first five CeCs identifiedfrom the study. The estimated figure for the Government component isprovided based on piloting cost of US$ 50,000 per telecentre for personalcomputers, local area networking a phone and Internet connection andtraining. This figure is subject to review based on the outcomes and recommendations of the proposed survey in the first phase, which will also establish a clear time frame of implementation. E. Sustainability, viability and expected impact The commitment from all stakeholders particularly the private sector to support the development of the rural areas and the substantial direct andindirect benefits of this project indicates that the project is viable. Informa-197tion and Communication Technology (ICT) services have immense potential for boosting Fiji's economy particularly the rural community. At present,the majority of the rural population is equipped only with basic telephone services for voice communication. Providing a better level of service through Internet access to the remote areas of Fiji will be a majorbreakthrough to the wide rural-urban digital divide enabling the ruralpeople to obtain information for empowerment and life improvement in-cluding those around them. The setting up of rural CeCs is expected toderive the following related benefits: Rural telecentres would allow instant contact with the outsideworld and the two flow of information Faster, reliable and cheaper means of accessing information forthe rural population - (information is readily available as ruralpeople will not travel to the urban areas) Improved delivery of government services and information to therural community Increased computer literacy rate in the rural areas and at the national level Improved market access for agriculture, fisheries and forestry products - allows the ability to promote and sell locally pro-duced goods or services Improved farming standards due to access to information onbetter farming methods Improved health standards due to easy access to information onmedication and other health services Reduced poverty Improved enabling environment for economic growth in the ruralareas Reduced rural-urban migration (urban drift)Fiji Project framework Design summaryPerformanceMonitoring mechanisms Assumptions and risksindicators/targets Goal Improve the enablingenvironment foreconomic growth andpoverty reduction in ruralareas of the Fiji IslandsIncrease the percentage contribution of the ruralsector to overall economicgrowth Reduce the national and rural poverty levelsReserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) Quarterly Reviewand economic outlook MTC GDP Forecasting Report Bureau of Statistics (BOS) National Accounts Purpose Increase reliable andaffordable access to ICTservices in selected ruralareas of FijiIncreased Internet usage in the rural areas Increase rural household PC ownershipGovernment statistics HIES survey (rural component)The economicand political environment arestable198Fiji Design summaryPerformanceMonitoring mechanisms Assumptions and risksindicators/targets Improve access to agriculture,fisheries,forestry and SMEmarkets and informationImproved farming methods, productivity Increase in income generating activities, otherlivelihoodsGovernment quarterly project performance report Sectoral review reports for agriculture, fisheries,forests and SMEsThe Government is committed to rural development Sufficient capacity in ITCS and the TelecomFiji Limited (TFL) Outputs Rural TelecentresestablishedProvision of ICT services to more rural people.

INTRODUCTION It is evident now that information and communication technologies (ICT) will change the way people live, work, learn and entertain themselves.It will also change the way that governments operate worldwide. In India, theimpact of rapid proliferation of ICT on economic, social and communication structures has been significantly visible for the last decade or so. However, a vast majority of the rural population has yet to benefit from this greattechnological revolution. The Government of India has appreciated the factthat without active interventions from the Government in the first place andfrom the other civil society organizations, this increasing impact of ICT wouldresult in the creation of a host of divisions in the society. For a country like India where 72 per cent of its one billion citizens live in more than half-a- million villages, this would surely result in increasing disparity, alienation andsocial tension and further marginalization of a large number of its people invillages. On the other hand, ICT, if wisely deployed, with its inherentadvantages, could very well be the most effective instrument to reduce thedivide between \"haves' and 'have not's\" in this part of the world. The Government of India has taken up the National e-Governance Action Plan (NEGAP) to proliferate e-governance in a faster way for delivering Government-to-Government (G2G) and Government-to-Citizen (G2C) services within a stipulated period. For this purpose, NEGAP hasidentified 22 Mission Mode Projects (MMP), which are to be implemented ina phased manner over the next three to four years by the various line Ministriesand Departments concerned at the Central and State levels, as applicable, inaddition to the various other e-governance initiatives being undertaken by the respective States and Central Ministries. An Integrated Citizen Service Centre or Community e-Centre (CeC) has been identified as an element of the supportinfrastructure, one of the MMPs in the NEGAP, which would function as thedelivery outlet for some of these e-governance initiatives. The Department ofInformation Technology (DIT) has been identified as the nodal department toimplement this Mission Mode Project of Community e-Centre. This project concept proposal has been prepared on behalf of DIT for the consideration of ADB for supporting this activity, by way of creating an enabling environmentso that roll out of the hitherto successful pilot CeCs running in rural areas invarious states, takes place at a much faster pace across the country. It isintended that various State Governments would be the prime-implementingagency for this pilot project, which would establish 20,000 CeCs across the country in a project duration period of 24 months.India200II. BACKGROUND, ISSUES AND RATIONALE The telecommunication revolution in India is now primarily riding on mobile communications technology which is wireless at its major segments. Presently, every month, two million new mobile subscribers are added to the net, including rural India also. It may be mentioned here that out of over 600 districts in India, about 510 are classified as rural districts. However, Internet connections are at 400 per 10,000 and broadband con- nections two per 10,000, which are very far from the critical mass required for full exploitation of its advantages. Local \"economic opportunity\" is fast pulling the power of computing into communities, creating new types of work, increasing access to the capital and reducing the opportunity costs associated with various services and access to information. The cost of computing capacity is dropping and the growing capacity of computing is being incorporated in a wide variety of form factors that are differentially accessible to Indian people with a wider variety of income and assets. Cellular networks are helping to overcome barriers of difficult terrain and distance, primarily for voice communications. Newer technologies like Wi-Fi, corDECT, Wi-Max etc. are going to overcome additional challenges of terrain, infrastructure, capacity building, government procedures etc. With device convergence and ad- vancement of multimedia applications, computing is now taking on forms that fit with the life styles and environment characteristics of Indian people living in less developed rural conditions. Presently there is a nationwide awareness of growing economy in rural India. There are increased interactions between rural areas and cities and even between rural areas and other nations. Large Indian corporate business houses, multinational corporations and smaller, more targeted business entities, are increasingly and directly touching the lives of rural Indians with valued products and services. Against this backdrop, some state governments in India, various civil society entities, non-government organizations and local entrepreneurs have started, independently, building up ICT-enabled CeCs. Although these are functioning with various nomenclature, they all rely on ICT, in combination with innovative and unique business models (including government-sponsored centres), to catalyze local economic development and bring various products and services to rural Indians. Some of these successful pilot initiatives have been rolled out in limited ways across the states. At this point of time, there are about 10,000 such community e-centres established under different initiatives, serving a limited population of villages across the country. It may be mentioned here that due to vast geographical spread of India and all possible terrestrial, environmental and climatological condi- tions prevailing in the half-a-million Indian villages, the local need of the rural people for various citizen-centric services varies widely. Further, as India has 22 scheduled official languages and more than 45 spoken languages (approximately 350 dialects) across the country, one of the majorIndia201challenges in providing efficient services through rural CeCs is the avail- ability of appropriate content in local languages. There are other areas of concern as well, including connectivity, reliable power to keep connectivity available, appropriate user-friendly technology, training for the huge staff needed and above all, changing the mindset of the people to adapt and absorb new technology and business processes. III. THE PROPOSED PROJECT The proposed project is to implement a pilot scheme for establishing 20,000 community e-centres across the Indian States within two years. Thescheme is devised basically, to demonstrate a proof-of-concept, for furtherrolling out at much larger scale. It is felt that if 20,000 pilot CeCs can beestablished within two years, then the project can be rolled out at a much faster pace with active interventions from various other stakeholders (finan- cial institutions and credit societies, for example) to cover all 600, 000villages in the country. A. Purposes (or objectives) To create and implement a sustainable platform of entrepreneurship for enabling the development of the rural economy and society across theIndian States through the use of ICT by setting up 20,000 CeCs in a pilotphase, within 24 calendar months. In a broad sense, objectives of these CeCs are: To create a low cost vehicle for government institutions so that easy, direct and cost-effective delivery of e-governance services to the rural citizen can be possible To develop, test and demonstrate, portfolio of products and services which can be delivered through these centres To customize and deliver standard products and services as perlocal needs; To build capacity for support system for new enterprise and infrastructure To provide a platform to Civil Society Organizations (CSOs)and NGOs to reach and communicate with remote and isolatedcommunities To demonstrate that to bring sustainable economic and socialgrowth in underserved rural India by using the benefits ICT, one has to take sustainable business approach and not merely a philanthropic approach By meeting all these objectives above, to create significant andlasting impact on rural livelihood in the areas of empowerment,equal opportunity, gender equity, social inclusion, better gover-nance, employment generation and human development B. Scope of the project, components, methodology and key activities This pilot project will provide the owners of 20,000 pilot community e-centres across the States the aspects of development of entrepreneurshipabilities.India202The programme would also demonstrate complete understanding of revenue generation mechanisms in their typical capacities and settings. The Project will further deliver services ranging from e-government, private and commercial services to its target group, with adequate control of the service delivery mechanism. The CeCs will manage and provide services and information to the end-users in a flexible and cost effectivemanner. It will generate the scope for capacity building, updating andcreate/build new entrepreneurs. It will bring the dynamism and speed of thegrowth of the umbrella of services, by improving the quality as well asquantity of delivery. The process steps described below in this methodology is drawn up for establishing one CeC at one location which can be concurrently carriedout at all the targeted locations. The process steps describe the CeC lifecycle ending at the roll-out expansion programme. The wholeoperationalization process cycle is expected to take 90 days from theinitiation of the activity to the selection of a location for the CeC. C. Implementation arrangements Central Government - Department of IT: Policy interventions, e.g. issuing Advisory to the State Govern- ments to allow State WAN (SWAN) to be used by network channel orchestrator (NCOs) with required bandwidth capacity free of cost To provide grant to state-designated implementing agency for CeC To explore the possibility of arranging financial incentives from Department of Revenue - Government of India, through taxconcessions etc. for the NCOs To provide assistance to State Governments in selection of NCOs To closely monitor implementation and progress at a programmelevel State Government: To evolve appropriate institutional mechanisms for implementation To empower the District Authority to take decisions to fast track implementation To provide SWAN connectivity to CeCs free of cost To arrange for delivery of all possible government services through CeCs Selection of NCOs To assist NCOs in selection of village entrepreneurs To work out mutually agreeable model for revenue sharing with NCO and village entrepreneur To arrange for any other logistic support to NCO for operation of the CeCs To launch appropriate awareness campaign at village and district level for CeCsIndia203GovernmentDonorsItem (state and(ADB)Total cost central) 1.

INTRODUCTION India's economy, particularly agriculture, has often been described as \"a gamble in the monsoon\". This is because of the growth linkages between agriculture and industry, on the one hand, and the dependence ofnearly 66 per cent of the cultivated land on rainfall for raising crops, onthe other. Climate management is key to managing water, energy, health,agriculture, biodiversity and ecosystem management. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) provides uncom- mon opportunities for reaching the unreached and including the excluded interms of knowledge and skill empowerment. Poverty persists under condi-tions where the human resource is under valued and material resources areover-valued. Several countries in our region have experienced rapid eco-nomic and social development only because of education and the acquisi- tion of skills relevant to market driven enterprises. ICT is already playing an important part in every-day life, and will continue to expand its impact. Exciting and innovative developments in thefast moving world of ICT have huge implications on every field ofagriculture. Recent advances in ICTs, when combined with application of contemporary instructional methods of open and distance learning, offer unprecedented opportunities for large number of people to gain access toeducation over an extended period of time. The recent enhancement intechnology availability for connectivity in India can now be combined withnational achievements in distance learning in higher education to establish anew paradigm of virtual education for large masses of people. To make it useful in the immediate context, it is needed to identify topics that are in demand by the rural communities who stand to gain in a considerablemeasure by such a combination of approaches. The challenge now is to enlist technology as an ally in the move- ment for economic, social and gender equity. The most important andinteresting issue relating to the rapid expansion of new ICTs in Third World countries is not the Internet by itself, but the potential of its interaction with other electronic media, such as radio and television. Thisconvergence between radio and the Internet provides useful examples onhow to create local content, relevant to local needs and local culture, andprovide this content in local languages. These contents should be dissemi-nated through community e-centres (CeCs) to the rural community.India207II. BACKGROUND, ISSUES AND RATIONALE The M. S. Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF) chose the imparting of a pro-nature, pro-poor, pro-women and pro-livelihood orienta-tion to technology development and dissemination to the rural and tribal areas as its main mandate when it started functioning in Chennai in 1989. In order to assist in the articulation of concepts, opportunities and operational strategies which can help to \"reach the unreached\" in knowl-edge, skill and technological empowerment, an annual inter-disciplinarydialogue has been organized since 1990, under the generic title, \"NewTechnologies: Reaching the Unreached\". The 1992 Dialogue was on information technology, which gave birth to the Information Village Research Project in the Union Territory of Pondicherry, with financial support from the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) and Canadian International Development Agency(CIDA). Since information, to be of value to rural women and men, should belocation and time specific, the term \"knowledge centre\" was used to stress theneed for converting generic into location specific information and for traininglocal women and men in adding value to information. Value-added information is appropriately referred to as knowledge and \"Rural Knowledge Centres\" can generate opportunities for educated youth in villages to take up a career inknowledge management and dissemination. Close to 50,000 people living inthese villages benefit from this programme. Although the programme uses avariety of technologies, the focus is on the people, their contexts and theirneeds. This project is empowering everyone with knowledge and opportunityby an inclusive use of local language and multimedia format. Its purpose is to improve lives through enhanced livelihood opportunities. This project won the Motorola Dispatch Solution Gold Award and Stockholm Challenge Award. Many journals cover this project. RecentlyScientific American is selecting this project is one of the best projectamong the 50 projects all over the world. From the experience of seven years, the project has gained some useful insights on how access to information and the use of ICTs can helpin poverty eradication and empowering women. The bottom up approach, unlike many telecentre projects, is an integrated development approach in which ICTs are used wherever necessary in every aspect of development. It is such a network, linking experts and the grassroots level people, that MSSRF wants to build as a Virtual Academy. The new initiative, the NationalVirtual Academy for Rural Prosperity (NV A), which was inaugurated inAugust 2003 and will use ICTs in building the assets of the rural poor in theareas of knowledge, market-driven skills, management and marketing. Most of the farming community urgently needs dynamic market, fertilizer and pesticides information. Most of the government research institutions have rich data. But unfortunately the mechanism to reach the datato the poor is rather weak. Our country is data rich but action poor; field levelaction lags far behind academic know-how. Therefore, the initiative to harnessmodern ICT for bridging this knowledge and skill gap is a timely one.India208The NVA will exemplify such an approach and will enable rural families and local administrators and policy makers to prepare effectiveresponses to the emerging problem of climate-induced disasters. This will also help to empower the farm women and men in dry farming regions with information, knowledge and skills relevant to the enhancement of theproductivity, profitability and sustainability of the major farming systems of rain fed, semi-arid areas. III. THE PROPOSED PROJECT A. Purposes (or objectives) The overall goal of the proposed project is to enable the five states, namely, Tamil Nadu, Pondicherry, Kerala, Orissa and Rajasthan to becomethe Millennium Development states in the country based on United Nations Millennium Development Goals. In the proposed project, greater attention will be paid to the most crucial aspects of development, viz. education (ofboth farming community particularly rural women), nutrition and healthcare. Reaching science to rural women and men is more important now than ever before. The main goal of the community e-centres is promotion of human security and happiness in all its dimensions. We will initiate the community e-centres project under Jamsetji Tata National Virtual Academy for Rural Prosperity. B. Scope of the project, components, methodology and key activities The main aim of the NV A is that knowledge should reach every home and hut. The State Level Hub located at MSSRF will be the key knowledgesource that will create and maintain web sites and databases for the local hubs in close collaboration with national and international agencies. These will also serve as the primary data providers tied up with researchinstitutions, field stations and government extension departments, and will provide access to various models for analysis and prediction of climate changes in small or micro regions. The state level hub links to block level orequivalent hubs in the state. The latter hubs serve a cluster of villages. In the local hubs (block level), interactive computer-based instructional modules will teach rural families the best farming practices and livelihood opportunities. The hubs will also act as training locations for farming communities, school children, discussion places for both farmers and policymakers, counselling point for rural women, diagnosis centre for simple cataracts and refractive errors. The local hubs will also gather and maintain data on soil and hydrology and will make them available to the public domain for analysisusing appropriate models. From the local hubs the knowledge will be disseminated through CeCs. The local hub also acts as a rural electronic library. In the proposed CeCs, the project plans to use the Internet, cable TV, community ham and Internet radio, VSAT, wired and wireless network, direct PC and community newspaper in an integrated way for launching aknowledge revolution in rural India. The project also plans to use traditional technologies such as public address system, notice boards, and bulletins to spread information to therural community.India209D.

Sustainability, viability and expected impact MSSRF aims at reaching frontier technology to the resource poor rural women and men and enabling them to become masters of their own destiny. Jamsetji Tata National Virtual Academy for Rural Prosperity intends to elect one million NVA fellows by 2010, at least one woman and one man inevery village. The Mission is to help Self-Help Groups (SHGs) to evolve intoSustainable Self-Help Groups (SSHGs) rooted in the principles of economics,ecology and gender and social equity. The bottom line of the ICT movement in rural India should be \"food, health, literacy and work for all\". Credit, management, market and technology are the four pillars of Sustainable Self-Help Groups for job led economic growth. The community e-centresprogramme will help MSSRF to create more fellows and ICT Self-HelpGroups. Through ICT SHGs, MSSRF will continue this important programme. The outcome of the e-community centre project will be a model for the use of modern ICTs to promote sustainable rural development with severalpartners and rural community. The ultimate goal is to develop a user- controlled, owned and managed network, which will help to reach the unreached and include the excluded in terms of information, knowledge andskill empowerment. This Academy aims to connect frontier technology withresource poor rural women and men and enable them to become masters oftheir own destiny. It will help to create large numbers of knowledge managersin the villages, most of whom will be women. Thus, bridging the digital divide will also become a powerful instrument for bridging the gender divide. This Virtual Academy emphasizes the critical role of ICTs in achieving the United Nations Millennium Development Goals in the areas of hunger and poverty elimination as well as in gender equity and health security. With thehelp of a large number of partners in different parts of India, it is desirable tobuild a family of Fellows of the Virtual Academy, who will be the torchbearersof knowledge for a hunger and poverty-free India movement. The aim is toachieve a sustainable reduction in hunger and poverty by 15 August 2007, which marks the 60 th anniversary of India's independence.

INTRODUCTION The low level of ICT penetration in rural areas around Indonesia (0.2 per cent) is seen as the main obstacle for Indonesia to quickly take part in thedevelopment of the Information Society. Initiatives based on the collaboration of government, private sector, civil society and civil society groups have included numerous efforts to increase the ICT penetration level. Efforts havebeen arranged in both ways, creating the demand, i.e. creating an increased level of awareness through socialization activities, as well as, to some extent, creating the supply, i.e. providing some level of infrastructure availability - orat least creating pilot activities in making technology available. The World Summit on Information Society (WSIS) has targeted by 2015 half of the world's population will have access to the Internet - which is seen as the backbone of the Information Society. Indonesia, through the commitments made in December 2003, has taken this commit-ment and is now conducting a number of initiatives to ensure that those targets are reached. WSIS recognizes Community Access Points (CAPs) as one of the solutions in providing access to the community, which has beenfamiliarized in Indonesia through the WARNET concept. Even though access is the direct key measure of success, there have been views and approaches where CAP or specialized CAPs have been seen as the key to the opening up of SMEs in rural areas to the regional and global market. More than 90 per cent or Indonesia's business turnover is in the hands SMEs and informal businesses, and it is for that reason thatduring the monetary and economical crisis in 1997, the stagnancy of businesses in general affected a lot of the large corporations, but not the SME and informal business. The nature of the flexibility and durabilityallowed them to quickly adapt to the new situation and later carried the country through the difficult times. The idea of using CAPs is not a totally new idea. However, implementing CAPs in a controlled situation where conducive conditions are created to support the SMEs in Indonesia have not been done. This is part ofthe problem in creating a sustainable CAP, in addition to other problems such as infrastructure access and awareness of the business community. This project is made of a few components: planning, purchasing and implementation, setup and impact review process in the implementation of CAP in an area where SMEs are the predominant business activities. ToIndonesia214prove that the concept is working, two locations will be chosen and installed with CAP facilities, according to the CAP model for SME which have beenset by the CAP Programme of the Ministry of Communications and Information. The CAP programme will collaborate with the local government and a local non-government organization (NGO) who will be given trainingpreparation to ensure they are able to facilitate the CAP facility. II. BACKGROUND, ISSUES AND RATIONALE The following points are issues which need to be resolved prior to the installation: Selection of CAP area Implementation of CAP Model Selection of NGO to support the activity Maintaining the equipment and facilities Making available relevant applications for SMEs Keeping long term sustainability Measuring the success of the implementation III. THE PROPOSED PROJECT A. Purposes (or objectives) The project has the following purposes: To implement two CAP sites for SMEs in a chosen rural area To review the implementation of the CAP site To have a modified, reviewed working CAP site to support SMEs Research report answering the following research questions: - \"How effective is the CAP SMEs site for local SMEs?\" - \"What is the effect of CAP SMEs to the community?\"- \"What is (if any) the multiplier effect of CAP SMEs?\" CAP Model : The project is implemented based on the assumptions that the following CAP model for SMEs as according to the Kominfo CAP model, and the following will be the setup (note that there will be two sites withthe same specification): Ten computers networked (LAN) - with the appropriate Operat-ing System One computer - networked and used by the CAP facilitator - this will also act as a fax send/receive station One server connected to the LAN with the appropriate Operat- ing System Two printers (laser printers for durability) One scanner - which will also be used as a fax sending interface One telephone line (also used as fax machine - send/receive) Internet connection (paid for one year for the duration of theproject) CAP software to maintain usage and printingIndonesia215Fax send/receive software Relevant SME applications (depending on the type of SME chosen) One trainer/SME facilitator (this must come from the NGO) One CAP manager (this must come from the NGO) Note : Outside the formal hours of SME usage, the CAP facility will be open to the public where they will be able to use the facility for general Internet use. To use the facility, there will be a minimal amount of fee which will be used to pay miscellaneous costs of the CAP. This income,together with the income received from the use of CAP by SMEs (model to be determined in the planning stage) will be the base of sustainability of the CAP. B. Scope of the project, components, methodology and key activities The project approach made up of a few stages, consisting of the activities: Stage A: Planning stage (1 month) Establishing a selection criteria for the two CAP sites Choosing the CAP sites Identifying a local NGO which will take part in the activity Arranging collaboration with the local government Arranging collaboration with the local NGO Planning and selection of CAP sites (physical location) Planning for the application (relevant content) usage Planning for the equipment usage and room layout Stage B: Preparation and procurement stage (1 month) Training the NGO in determining work practice Preparation of the CAP sites Installation of equipment Installation of software Approaching the SMEs and creating first level awareness Stage C: Commissioning stage (1 month) Training the NGO in determining work practice Installing SME trade expert on-site for SMEs Ongoing training (every day - morning) for SMEs Stage D: Monitor and review process (9 months) Conduct review of process using a predetermined set of review measures Modify model and CAP site operations to reflect the measures Measure sustainability of the CAP sitesIndonesia216C.

INTRODUCTION Information and communication technology (ICT) is playing an increasingly important role in country development throughout Asia. Al- though countries vary greatly in their readiness to use ICT, and even within any country there are great variations in the availability of ICT infrastruc-ture, all countries have embarked on the development of ICT as a tool for governance, business and education. In particular, many governments, non- governmental and private organizations across the region are looking to e-learning as a tool for capacity building and increasing the capacity of a country to respond to its needs. Community e-centres (CeCs) have been developed in many locations and there is great potential for these centres tohelp deliver targeted, high-quality information to the community. Rice plays a part in achieving many of the United Nations Millen- nium Development Goals (MDGs), and two in particular - eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, and ensuring environmental sustainability -depend heavily on continued and strengthened efforts to help farmers grow rice more efficiently and profitably in a sustainable manner. Improvements in rice farming help not only farmers, farm workers and their families, butalso millions of rice-consuming poor. It is difficult to achieve real, sustain- able improvements without effective delivery of the results of rice research. This three-year project will bring together ICT and rice production to improve agricultural extension workers' ability to deliver new, validatedpractices to farmers. The project will achieve greater impact by improving extension workers' management and communication capabilities, thus ensur- ing that good practices are more effectively transferred to farmers. Buildingthese skills - which are urgently needed in many rice-dependent communi- ties - is essential if CeCs are to help deliver agricultural training and information about the latest farming technologies. Over the past four years, the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) has developed the Rice Knowledge Bank (RKB) and captured within it a wealth of rice-farming information aimed at extension officers across the region. The RKB also contains information about the process of extensionand the skills required by extension officers. Promotion and training across the region has seen the RKB used widely by national agricultural research and extension services (NARES), non-governmental organizations (NGOs)and universities. However, the value to rice farmers of the RKB's informationInternational Rice Research Institute (IRRI)218has not been fully realized. This project is designed to open another channel for both accessing RKB information and effectively delivering it to farmers via CeCs and similar Internet access points. This project will operate for three years in IRRI's partner countries of Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, India, Lao People's Democratic Re- public, Myanmar, Nepal, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Viet Nam. The project will complement the existing IRRI activity with these coun- tries' respective government agencies. II. BACKGROUND, ISSUES AND RATIONALE IRRI conducts research with national partners that produce technolo- gies that improve rice farming and, hence, the livelihoods of farmers, farm workers and rice consumers. Many of the millions of rice producing poorare unable to grow enough rice to feed themselves and their families. The results of IRRI's research can help farmers improve their food security through better rice production, which increases the opportunity for crop andincome diversification through greater availability of land, labour and capital. To realize this potential and further improve livelihoods, the effective transfer of new 'know-how' to farmers is essential. Unfortunately, access to information by farmers is often weak, hindering the use of the new information and technologies by those whocan benefit most from them. This knowledge gap is compounded by a lack of essential skills, particularly in communication and management, that are required by people working in extension if they are to effectively transfertechnologies to farmers in a manner that leads to sustainability. It is important to realize that the information that extension workers need, if they are to genuinely help farmers, includes not only technical knowledgebut also knowledge and skills that increase the effectiveness of delivery. Improving access to these vital extension skills will lead to better designed, delivered and supported technologies, thereby improving uptake by farmers.Furthermore, because these skills include basic management and communi- cation, they are applicable beyond rice farming extension to other aspects of agriculture and to other sectors. Many previous projects have addressed extension quality and effec- tiveness, and have aimed to improve extension services, particularly thosemanaged by governments. Although these have had some success, they have not fully addressed the issue because they have not been part of a holistic programme. A successful programme needs to provide extensionworkers not only with access to relevant, up-to-date information at a place and time of their convenience, but also teach them how best to access the information they need and how to most effectively deliver it to farmers.This project will bring together, through CeCs, training in extension skills and the most up-to-date, accurate farming information available, as well as improving the content and transfer to farmers of vital information. Theproject will strengthen CeCs by helping them to better meet the needs of an important sector of the people and communities they service.International Rice Research Institute (IRRI)219III.

PROJECT PURPOSE Extension has been made more effective by the ready availability through CeCs of the latest, accurate farming information and technology, and associated training in extension management and communications.220B. Scope of the project, components, methodology and key activities The project will work with rural communities with linkages to rural development partners in the major rice producing countries of Asia. Thusthe scope of the final project will be user-driven as it will involve onlythose countries committed to success. The methodology of the project builds on three important assets of IRRI: its extensive in-country networks, which will identify and support local partners; the existing volume ofknowledge contained in the Rice Knowledge Bank; and extensive experi-ence in delivering ICT training across the region. The outputs will beachieved by selecting e-centre partners to work with the relevant IRRI staffto promote RKB use through the centres. The implementation arrangements below describe further how the project will unfold. The key activities include: The nine management and communication courses have been designed, coded, tested and revised Each CeC has two staff who have been trained to use the RKB and its e-learning Each CeC has conducted the nine e-learning blended courses for 30 participants C. Implementation arrangements IRRI has considerable contact with government agricultural structures and through these it will be able to attract support for the wider use of the RKB through CeCs. IRRI also ensures that the information in the RKB is validatedfor each country and modified as appropriate. Where necessary, informationwithin the RKB is translated into local language and stored in country-specificsections, where other local, relevant information is also stored. The project requires international consultancy from extension and training experts both within IRRI and beyond. These experts will bring thelatest information to the materials, ensuring that the information in the RKBis the latest and most accurate available. Local consultant input would berequired to work with the partners to identify priority material that needs to betranslated and loaded onto the country specific Knowledge Bank sites. Each government partner will identify and ensure adequate support for the collaborating CeCs. They will also facilitate the linkages to the relevantdevelopment partners in each country to ensure that the primary needs of thecommunities are known and the e-communities are being used to provide therequired information. The key workers at each CeC will document theprimary knowledge needs, work with the relevant staff to access the knowledge and feed it back in the relevant form to the knowledge seekers. In cases, where the knowledge is not available they will provide the feedback toIRRI and other relevant partners to ensure that the knowledge gap is filled.IRRI will manage the project and act as the executing agency. All of the e-learning courses will reside in the IRRI-maintained RKB. The RKB is designed for use by people within the extension community and is accessed over two million times per year. The RKB is available on CD-International Rice Research Institute (IRRI)221ROM for people with limited Internet access. IRRI also promotes the RKB through in-country offices and partner networks. E-learning within the RKBwill be promoted and disseminated via these extensive regional networks and the major consortia that operate through IRRI across the region. Project outputs will be monitored and evaluated against a baseline of data collected at the beginning of the project. The social science staff at IRRI will define the framework for monitoring and evaluation, and overseelocal staff who will collect and report on the data. D. Cost and financing * Item T otal cost 1.

Sustainability, viability and expected impact Building on existing committed partners and relationships means that this project is viable and will be sustainable. There is no desire here to build something new, but rather the strength of the project lies in addingvalue to existing activities. Improving the impact of research will see more than 8,000 agricul- tural extension workers receive training that will have two clear benefits,from which many other benefits will flow. First, participants will improve their knowledge and skills in information and communication technology. Second, participants will receive training on specific aspects of communica-tion and management essential to effective extension. In many countries, extension management and communication skills are weaker than they need to be. This creates a knowledge gap that prevents farmers obtaining theinformation they need to improve their production. The target group of the project is trainers. Their new skills will flow on to many thousands of farmers and farm workers. After participating in the course, trainers and extension workers will be better able to findInternational Rice Research Institute (IRRI)222information that meets farmer needs and more effectively deliver it to farmers. New information and technology will be transferred from researchto the field in a sustainable way. More farmers will be reached more often.They will learn faster, retain more information and will themselves bebetter able to pass information on to their colleagues, workers and families. Ultimately, this will help farmers improve their food security through better rice production and increased opportunity for crop and income diversifica-tion due to greater availability of land, labour and capital - real progresson the path to improved livelihoods for the millions of poor people wholive in rice-dependent communities.

INTRODUCTION The first step in the creation of e-community will be the programme of electronic government. The programme will provide citizens and organi-zations with fast and qualitative access to state services, and increasedefficiency of functioning of state bodies by wide application of informationand communication technologies. The objectives of the programme will be: Provide rural areas with a population of over 200 which cur- rently do not have telephone lines, with telephone services Modernize present rural telecommunication network to provideagriculture complex with modern telecommunication services Modernize present rural telecommunication network to develop the Internet, e-mail and mobile telecommunication services. II. BACKGROUND, ISSUES AND RATIONALE With the view of enabling automated information interaction between state bodies, development of information infrastructure based on introduc- tion of common e-document circulation is under way as well as develop-ment of Web-portal for Government Departmental information systems with e-government elements(integrated tax information system, register of taxpayers and taxation objects, customs automated information system, infor- mation system of State Center for pension payment and others) The introduction of e-government in Kazakhstan aims to improve quality of services, reduce time of state services for citizens and organiza- tions, provide access to the information database of state bodies, and to improve administrative system to form efficient and optimum state apparatus. The priorities for e-government are: provision of Internet access; improvement of education level in information technology (IT); and mod- ernization of public administration system. The introduction of e-government will enable the government to improve the public administration system, as formation of e-state servicesKazakhstan224envisages reengineering in administrative processes. Taking into account world experience in e-government formation, it will be implemented in three stages: The first stage - e-government infrastructure formation - aims at initiation of such base components as a portal and gateway for e-govern- ment that include: development of a payment gateway for interaction withthe banking system, a national identification system, a common transport sphere of state bodies, formation and development of interdepartmental systems, establishment of central and local executive bodies, promotion ofaccess to e-services, introduction of measures to reduce information access inequalities, and improvement of IT education levels. Provision of informa- tion and interactive services will be implemented at this stage. The second stage - e-government services - aims at development of diverse services for citizens and functioning of state bodies and full-scale reengineering of administrative processes. Transaction services will be implemented at this stage. The third stage - information community formation - envisages transformation of state bodies and organizations, information community formation including implementation of such programmes as e-medicine, e- education, e-culture, e-democracy and others. III. THE PROPOSED PROJECT A.

INTRODUCTION In Lao People's Democratic Republic, e-community is just at the starting point and community e-centres (CeC) have not yet been established in the country. Sharing knowledge, experiences, and information throughthe Internet nationwide is still a problem, especially at provincial and district levels, where the connection is very slow. In provinces and districts, reliable dialup connections from the local Internet Service Provider (ISP),Lao Telecommunication Company (LTC), can not be guaranteed, because the local ISP lines are insufficient to meet the demand of the growing customer base. Connecting to the Internet through a modem takes a lot oftime. The only solution is to make a long distance dialup to Vientiane, the country's capital, but it's expensive and very slow. Another constraint is the slowness of dialup Internet access. Unlike digital telephone lines in Vientiane, the analogue telephone lines arecapable of supporting up to only 24 kbps of data transfer. So, transferring big files may take days to complete. One of the state enterprises, the Enterprise of Telecommunications Lao (ETL), has been laying a fibre optic network in Vientiane Municipal- ity. The fibre network has been spreading out to the other provinces. The ETL is a 100 per cent state owned enterprise. The following provinceshave the ETL fibre infrastructure already: (1) Vientiane; (2) Luangprabang; (3) Champasack; and 4) Savannakhet. The ETL has been helping the Science Technology and Environment Agency (STEA) to setup government provincial Internet gateways in these provinces by laying out the lines required. The provincial Internet gateways are connected to the ETL fibre network via copper wires. The other end ofthe fibre network is connected to STEA which provides the Internet bandwidth. All the network traffic will pass through one of the two STEA gateways to get to the Internet. STEA has two separate Internet gateways. One gateway is connected to the existing ThaiCom satellite while the other is connected to CAT Telecom Public Company Limited (CAT Telecom) in Thailand. The CAT Telecom linkis sponsored by Thai Government for a year. The ministries in Vientiane continue to use the ThaiCom gateway while provincial Internet gateways are using the CAT Telecom gateway. The remaining provinces may have theprovincial Internet gateways installed in around three or four months' time.Lao People's Democratic Republic228In a separate issue, STEA has also obtained funding from the Swedish International Development Cooperation (SIDA) to setup an Internet exchangegateway. Right now, Sweden University's master degree students are helpingSTEA and the other ISPs to configure and setup the exchange. The first phasewas initiated by International Development Research Centre (IDRC) grant. Currently, ETL does not provide local dialup Internet access in the three provinces. Planet Online ISP is using ETL infrastructure, so it is not an optiontoo. GlobNet ISP does not have the Internet presence in the provinces. Theonly company that is present in the three provinces is Lao Telecom Company (LTC). LTC is a joint venture company between Lao government and Shinawatra International Plc. LTC offers both local dialup and broadbandservices. The broadband service is based on satellite technology. The LTC'scheapest broadband plan will provide one public IP address. An IP sharingrouter is required to support more than one PCs surfing the Internet. II. BACKGROUND, ISSUES AND RATIONALE The steps towards rural development in the Lao People's Democratic Republic are considered to be: (1) agricultural development; (2) rural infrastructure development; (3) income diversification; (4) rural financialservices; and (5) capacity building and strengthening. The main goals of rural development are to alleviate poverty, stabilize shifting cultivation and stop opium production in rural areas where projects intervene. The implementation of these components therefore areto: (1) provide permanent jobs to communities; (2) facilitate communities to access markets and environments outside their premises; (3) introduce new activities that foster communities' income generation; and (4) buildand enhance not only capacity of relevant government line agencies but also communities for the sustainability of project activities. Market facility establishment, market information dissemination, knowledge and experiences sharing are considered the second step of ruraldevelopment. Establishing markets will help communities to have places to sell their products whereas market information dissemination will help them to better set up prices for their products. Allowing communities to shareknowledge and experiences will not only give communities the new ideas but also ways to improve their capacity and development their communities. How can communities effectively share information, knowledge and experiences? Information technology is considered a key factor for thispurpose. Through the Internet, information can be disseminated faster. For reading electronic messages and surfing the Internet, the district offices can dialup two telephone lines in the central provincial offices or LTC telephone lines. For transferring bigger files, the district offices can deliverthese big files to the central provincial offices in writable compact disks (CDs) or universal serial bus (USB) thumb drives provided. The location between central provincial offices and the district offices are not very far apart.Lao People' s Democratic Republic229III. THE PROPOSED PROJECT A. Purposes (or objectives) One purpose of this project is to enable information, experiences and knowledge sharing nationwide specially connecting information to ruralpoor people in Lao People's Democratic Republic. In order to do so, allprovinces and districts need to be able to easily connect to the Internet. B. Scope of the project, components, methodology and key activities To achieve the goal there are four main activities need to be undertaken: (1) construction of building; (2) procuring equipment;(3) procuring software; and (4) setting up of networks in provinces anddistricts. C. Implementation arrangements STEA will be the executive agency for the proposed study. Line ministries will form a steering committee. The Steering Committee mem-bers will include representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs(MOFA), the Committee for Planning and Investment (CPI), the Ministry ofAgriculture and Forestry (MAF), the Ministry of Health (MOH) and otheragencies concerned. The focal agency will be the Department of Informa-tion and Technology under the STEA. D. Cost and financing The total cost is estimated at US$ 800,000 equivalent.

INTRODUCTION Mongolia is a diverse country with many talents and resources. However, since privatization in the early 1990's, Mongolia has not progressedtechnologically with the rest of the world. This is due to various factors that include central and private fiscal issues, the harshness and vastness of the country, the climate, and the distribution of the population. While the capital,Ulaanbaatar, has some access to today's technologies, Internet access is poor,unreliable, relatively expensive, and not easily available to the generalpopulation. Outside of Ulaanbaatar, access is even worse and essentially non-existent in the nomadic, rural areas. Most children lack Internet technology both at home and at school. During the centralization period, Mongolia's literacy rate was near 90 per cent, but has been declining due to the lack offinancial resources and poor access to the world's latest technology. In orderto compete in the 21st century, this must be reversed. Internet technology mustbe made available to government, business, producers and children. In the past, Mongolia's rural economy was a reservoir not only for employment and livelihoods, but also for Mongolia's economic growth andexports. In 1990, 33 per cent of all workers were employed in theagricultural sector; by 2004, that figure had grown to 44.5 per cent.Currently, the Mongolian agricultural sector accounts for 20 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Half of the total 2.5 million population lives in rural areas and their main source of wealth is livestock. Farmersand the rural population can potentially receive information through differ-ent media and approaches such as folk and traditional social gatherings,rural radio for community development, video and multimedia modules forfarmer training, and the Internet for linking researchers, educators, extensionists and producer groups (small and medium-sized entrepreneurs) to each other. However, access is limited, antiquated, and does not extendto the end-level producers. Complicating matters were the particularly harshwinters (Dzud) that occurred at the turn of the century, with heavysnowfalls and temperatures reaching the -50\u00b0 C levels in some parts of thecountry. It is estimated that Mongolia herders lost nearly 50 per cent of their livestock during each of two successive years. While recovery is taking place, it is being done so without the poorer producers havingaccess to the latest available technologies that the Internet could provide.Mongolia232Mongolia currently has no organized e-centre model. Access to the Internet and its information is limited to government, larger private busi-ness, and the more affluent levels of society. There exists the NationalAgricultural Extension Centre network, established several years ago at theMinistry of Food and Agriculture, which is working towards the develop-ment of an extension network throughout Mongolia. Currently, all aimigs (larger towns) have provincial branch offices, and these extension centresare currently playing an important role in disseminating information andtechnology to producers. This agricultural programme can be used as amodel from which to build an community e-centre network throughoutMongolia, with extension of access and service to the all-important soum and bag levels (the lowest administrative units). II. BACKGROUND, ISSUES AND RATIONALE Mongolia faces many issues that are quite unique in providing ICT for educational and economic purposes. Located in central Asia, it is land- locked, and access to materials and supplies involves transport through either eastern Russia to the north, or China as the gateway to theeconomies of the Pacific Rim. The Mongolian topography includes poorly accessible mountain regions and the Gobi desert. Its climate is quite harsh, being dry and cold, resulting in a very limited crop-producing season.Transportation and infrastructure are lacking, especially outside ofUlaanbaatar. The countries roads are quite limited, and poorly maintained, especially in the rural areas. Some areas do not have electricity. Half of Mongolia's population resides in Ulaanbaatar, and due to the recent poor economy, this figure is getting larger as rural farmers and herders migrate to the city to find employment. But much of the populationstill maintains their traditional, nomadic ways, resulting in a relatively poorer, difficult to access sector. These are the people who require special efforts to provide electronic access for educational and production purposes.In addition, the rural population does not have the financial resources to pay for e-centre services, nor is it prepared mentally to pay for it. Since privatization, access to education for the countries children has become less accessible, especially in rural areas. This is now being manifested in a new generation of poorly prepared citizens that potentially will add to the poverty of the country. Most schools do not have access tocomputers, the Internet, and thus, the information and technology that they provide. Contrasted to western and the Pacific Rim educational opportuni- ties, there is a critical need to supply all Mongolian students with thetechnology needed to compete in their nations and world economies. In addition to the access problems related to topography and the rural population distribution, infrastructure accessibility is also a major problem in Mongolia to creating an e-centre network.Mongolia233Current communication systems are aging, outdated, slow, and incon- sistent. They fail to reach the rural population. Mongolia is a poor country, and its inability to finance needed technological improvements furthercontribute to economical woes. Compounding these technical problems isthe issue that there is no institutional structure or extension service networkin the aimig , soum or bag levels, nor a legal basis to operate extension e- services. It will have to be decided whether this occurs through governmen- tal or private means. In the broader context of Mongolia's development, the issues facing the establishment of an e-centre network mirror the difficulties ofMongolia's developing economy. Improvement of its infrastructure, develop-ing it's resources, and establishing an information technology network areall related to Mongolia's ability to become a self-sustaining factor in theAsian economy. III. THE PROPOSED PROJECT It must be realized that Mongolia is only beginning to formulate its plans to establish an e-centre network. The project will initially be divided into four stages: Planning; procurement of administrators, consultants andtechnical support; infrastructure building and construction; and maintenance.The focus will be on how to connect electronic demand with supply atboth the informational provider/exchange network and the community(households and enterprises) levels. The goal is to establish a functioningsystem within five years. A. Purposes (or objectives) The project goals: To improve the education and livelihoods of the poor and rural populations, strengthening food security and reducing hun-ger. This would be accomplished through: (1) increased access to situation- appropriate and practical information; (2) adding value to existing net- works, projects, and communication capacity-building initiatives; and (3)establishing sustainable extension networking system involving all 385soums at nationwide. Key Activities : 1. Establish sustainable e-community/extension centre networking systems in rural areas; 2. Establish \"Rural Connect\" management teams;3. Identify criteria for selecting information provider and exchange networks; 4. Assist network facilitators with needs analysis and communication mapping; 5. Provide support, resources, guides and training materials for local capacity building, outreach, and network development; andMongolia2346. Develop, implement and maintain a continuous and participatory evaluation and learning system. Project Outcomes:1. Sustainable rural e-centres/extension centres in rural areas; 2. Demand for information met with appropriate supply; 3. Rural households and enterprises using information to make decisions leading to increased producer profitability and income security; 4. Increased responsiveness to rural production systems to opportu- nities and marker demand; 5. Identifiable outcomes in the educational performances of the Mongolian educational systems; and 6. Increased appreciation among the population for using new knowledge and technology into production. Business Model : 1. Subscription-based service; 2. Sponsorship of information providers and exchange networks; 3. General sponsorship and grants/access for all irrespective of ability to pay; and 4. Fee-for-service. Support Network: 1. Producer groups and community organizations; 2. Donors, international organizations, international and national NGOs, governments, and projects; 3. National Agricultural Research Systems; 4. Universities and academic institutions; 5. Agrobusiness; 6. Advisory services- public and private, NGO; and 7. Media and connectivity service providers. Assumptions/risks : 1. Stable government/political environment; 2. Continued financing through governmental, private and donor sources; 3. National/worldwide inflation; 4. Adequate domestic Wireless-based central and end-user accessibility. D. Cost and financing (US$) The initial cost estimates are based on establishing e-centres at each of the 360 bag levels in the rural countryside. Admittedly, these figures are somewhat premature and subject to revision.Mongolia235E. Sustainability, viability and expected impact Mongolia offers a unique opportunity to be the model for the underdeveloped countries of the world, by establishing and developing anetwork of e-centres to its underserved population. Because of geographicaland cultural factors, special challenges will need to be met to accomplishthis goal. However, the country's historical stability, educated and dedicatedworkforce, and favourable business climate present a great opportunity toaccomplish this goal. The fact that Mongolia was left economically disad-vantaged during privatization affords the opportunity to show that donorassistance can be very effective in enabling a culture to become education-ally and economically independent, with well-utilized assistance.Item Government Donors Total cost 1.

INTRODUCTION The Ministry of Information and Communications (MoIC) is respon- sible in the formulation of the policy, rules and regulations related to telecommunication development, radio and television broadcasting, postalservices, disseminating the information through electronic and print media.Under this Ministry, there is a Postal Services Department, Department ofPrinting, and Department of Information. The Department of Postal Serviceshas offices in all the 75 districts and more than 1,500 villages. MoIC also manages Nepal Telecommunications, Radio Nepal, Nepal Television, National News Agency, Gorakha Patra Sansthan (Government Publishing house), NepalPress Council, Nepal Film Development Board, Nepal TelecommunicationAuthority and three other private telephone operators in the country. II. BACKGROUND, ISSUES AND RATIONALE Nepal is a landlocked mountainous country with 147,181square kilometres of area with 17 per cent of plain land and 83 per cent of ruggedterrain. The population is about 23.4 million. Administratively the countryis divided into five development regions and 75 districts. The lowestadministrative units are municipalities in the town and Village Development Committee (VDC) in the village. Currently, there are 58 municipalities and 3,914 VDCs in Nepal Nepal is predominantly an agricultural country. Its contribution to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the largest followed by tourism, industry,transport and communication. A very large proportion of the population lives below the poverty line. The major source of government revenues are custom duty, value added tax and income tax. A little over half (57 per cent) of the population is reported economically active and among them 81 per cent were engaged in agricul-tural activities. Contributions of non-agricultural activities to the GDP are gradually increasing. Nepal being a mountainous country has different terrain and geography, so it is very difficult to develop the infrastructures in the country. Most partsof the country are devoid of road access, power supply, drinking waterfacilities, telephone connections, health facilities, and educational facilities. There is also a problem of the unemployment but the people are very much reluctant to adopt the traditional occupations. It is one of the major rootcauses that traditional professions such as agriculture, cottage industries (smalland medium sized enterprises), and handicrafts and so on have a very low rateNepal237of productivity and the expense of the production is also very high and can not compete with the imported goods in the markets. Traditional techniques offarming and manufacturing are still used. They have no entrepreneurship skill, no competent and modern marketing strategies, so they are not in the condition to develop their enterprises in the better ways. This has made the traditionalprofession and agricultures a non lucrative business. Despite the implementation of nine five-year plans and currently, in the middle of the 10 th plan, poverty is rampant in the rural areas. There are many projects and programmes that are working to alleviate poverty. Manyincome generating small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are beingestablished and empowering the people. The huge opportunities created bythe use of information communication technology (ICT) have acceleratedthe productivity in many economic sectors. It is effectively and efficientlyutilized to alleviate poverty in most of the developing countries and theyare successful to some extent. The 10 th five-years plan has only one broad objective, \"to reduce the poverty in the country\", and has envisaged a broad based economic growthto reduce the poverty. In Nepal, poverty is a multidimensional and complexproblem. Out of many root causes, the low economic growth is the mostimportant one and needs to be addressed in a proper way, with properprogrammes. In the 10 th Plan, it has been also stated that the opportunities of ICT would be extended to the rural areas in a coordinated andcompetitive manner. Realizing all theses facts, MoIC has proposed toestablish 25 Multi-purpose Communication Telecenters (MCTs) in differentparts of the country in the first phase. III. THE PROPOSED PROJECT A. Purposes (or objectives) In the effort to reduce poverty in the rural and peri-urban areas of Nepal, the use of ICT through MCT can be an effective tool. The recentand available technology can be utilized to make the profession the moresuccessful business and promote the income generating activities. Theultimate goal of this project is to utilize ICT through MCTs to uplift thepoverty of the rural people. The main objective of this project can be noted as follows: Providing Internet and e-mail facilities to the rural people Agricultural marketing and agricultural extension programmes Community and public health programmes Environment, forest and soil conservation activities Water and sanitation programme Adult literacy, vocational education and informal education programmes E-governance activities, passport, citizenship certificate, drivinglicense, vital registration such as birth E-commerce, especially making and selling of the local indig-enous technologies, products, handicrafts, artefacts etc.Nepal238Information dissemination, including the news, views and events Promoting the basic computer education Providing other logistic facilities such as public call office, telephone facilities, fax and basic secretarial works, type setting, lamination Small and medium income generating activities E-post, commercial use of MCT, as cyber caf\u00e9 B. Scope of the project, components, methodology and key activities MCT is one tools that can make the local people aware of the modern techniques to increase the productivities in agriculture, cottage industries, environmental, forest and soil conservation, health and sanitation activities, formal and non-formal education, vocational education, literacyprogrammes, and disseminating information about the news, views andevents. MCTs are not the panacea of all these sectoral developments. Thereshould be other activities, programmes, and plans to implement, so as tomake the people empowered and economically successful. ICT has been satisfactorily and successfully utilized for this purpose in some of the developing countries with the similar socio-economic conditions to Nepal. The pre-survey of MCT, establishment of MCT, content development for online and offline usages, organizing the user groups, employing the operators of MCT, and training them to use the machine and run the MCT in full phase, are some of the major activities that can be undertakenbefore starting the services of MCT in the communities. C. Implementation arrangements The implementation plan and arrangement can be different for different locations. The priority of the activities can also be different. Someof the common arrangement before establishing the MCT can be: Specifing or identifing non-governmental organizations(NGOs), community-based organizations (CBOs) Negotiating an memorandum of understanding with these agencies Selecting, organizing and appointing the user groups Raising awareness of the facilities, that the people are going toget, through the MCTs in the communities Participatory approach - with the local bodies, agencies, and thepeople Community baseline survey Preparing the potential user profile Focus group discussion on the scope, activities, and the opportu-nities Training and orientation Installing the equipments and connectivity Appointment of staff to work for the MCT Content development, coordination among different sectors (con-cerned ministries, departments, agencies, local bodies, NGOs) toprepare the appropriate content for online and offline servicesNepal239D. Cost and financing (US$) This is the first phase of the project, establishing 1,500 MCTs in the country, which has been targeted in the 10th five-year plan (2002-2007). About 19 MCTs have been established by various organizations already butnot any by the Ministry of Information and Communications. The estimated budget for establishing 25 MCT is: Item Government Donors Total cost 1. Consultants a. International consultants 60,000 b. Domestic consultants 50,000 2.

Sustainability, viability and expected impact Sustainability is always a major problem for MCT. Different ap- proaches would be taken in consideration to make them sustainable: To reduce the cost of operation, MCT will be established inpost offices. It will reduce the cost for training, space (rent) andalso in salary In the case where post offices are not available or not suitable,local bodies, communities will be consulted to establish andown the MCT. It will be established in consultation with them,and advertise the benefits of the MCT MCT will be equipped with fax machines, photocopier ma-chines, telephone sets, and so on, so it can also be used as apublic call office (PCO), fax, and photocopy service centre MCT can also be used as computer training centre, providingthe machines on a rental basis These can also be used as cyber caf\u00e9s during the off hours E-post programme can also be one of the usage of the MCT It can also be used as a call receiving centreNepal240These are some of the activities that can be useful to make the MCT sustainable. The activities can be different depending on the different needsand socio-economic conditions of the communities.

INTRODUCTION Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) has gained priority in the national development plans of Nepal as an important input fordevelopment. Emerging knowledge proves that societies of today are not freechallenges of unequal distribution of knowledge, creating so called the DigitalDivide. The phenomenon of the digital divide has enormous implications fora country like Nepal, wishing to leapfrog and catch-up development opportu-nities. The digital divide encompasses accessibility, affordability, and capacityto use the physical infrastructure of ICTs and the availability of digital content.Therefore, the concept of \"rich and poor\" also embraces \"information rich\"and \"information poor\". The divide could play a significant role in determiningthe competitiveness of an individual, group or society. It seems that thehitherto conceptual emergence of knowledge banks and information gatewaysmay make interesting contributions to the development scene. The innovative march of human efforts in ICT in the \"modern\" and \"post - colonial\" era have shown new dimensions to development work,knowledge and information exchange. Today, ICTs are no longer consideredas merely a \"technical appendix\" for internal computational needs. Beingintrinsically divorced from the geographical constraints, today, the power ofInternet is being used for electronic commerce (e-commerce) and assistanceto small- and medium-sized entrepreneurs; for the empowerment of commu-nities, women and youth; from the promotion of good governance anddecentralization to awareness campaigns for human rights and democracy;from long distance education to telemedicine and environment management;to foster and facilitate sustainable human development; to assist in the fightagainst poverty and strengthen informed and participatory decision-makingat the policy and planning levels; and to give voice to the peoplemarginalized in the process of development. Nepal is a land-locked country with 85 per cent of population living in rural areas. Only 40 per cent of the income of an average rural householdcomes from farming and the remaining 60 per cent from other income sources(Statistical Pocket Book, Nepal, CBS 2002). Rural poor people have tosupplement their income sources for survival. One alternative could begenerated through rural-urban interactions - flow of goods, services andpeople using different means of information and modern technology. Thismeans development efforts need to be directed towards strengthening ruraldevelopment programmes thereby enhancing rural-urban linkages, empoweringthe poor so that they can access the socio-economic development opportunitiesNepal242and potentials emanating from linkages and constituting an appropriate institutional mechanism that enables them to cope with the risk inherent inrural-urban interactions and reduce their vulnerability. This project proposal is prepared against this background. The purpose of the project is to secure the right of rural and urban people to a sustainablelivelihood. Specifically, the project aims to use ICT as an instrument for facilitating and promoting social and economic development through the use of e-governance and e-commerce to stimulate pro-poor rural-urban linkages;with a particular focus on the poor, disadvantage and women. The project will further expand and extend the ongoing efforts of the Rural-Urban Partnerships Programme (RUPP) which has been supported financially and technically byUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and executed by the Ministry of Local Development (MLD). Others partners of the Programme are: National Planning Commission (NPC), the Ministry of Physical Planning andWorks (MPPW) and the Ministry of Finance (MoF) of Nepal. II. BACKGROUND, ISSUES AND RATIONALE Nepal's current Tenth Five-Year plan (2002-2007) has an overarching goal of poverty reduction. Nepal is also committed to achieve the objective of the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) to halve humanpoverty and extreme income poverty by 2015. One of the targets of the plan is to reduce the absolute poverty level from 38 per cent to 32 per cent. A key element of the plan is to improve outreach to the most deprived and to those suffering from inequalities by refocusing assistance to address the needs of socially and economicallydisadvantaged groups, including women and people living in remote and rural areas. Among the measures considered as key for achieving Nepal's MDGs are the measures that will be required to empower people and communities andincreasing their stake in their own development through decentralization and support to community development schemes. Furthermore, the foremost challenge in reducing absolute poverty lies in the reduction of unemployment,through policies, strategies and programmes which utilize the labour resources of poor households, communities and their organizations. Macro-economic policies will have to be much more pro-labour 40. Far-reaching policies and strategies for the Nepal's use of Informa- tion Technology (IT) have been formulated by the Government. Amongthem, it is stated that: IT shall be applied for rural development The IT network shall be extended to rural areas Internet facilities will be gradually applied to all village devel-opment committees of the country IT will be used to promote e-commerce, e-health, among others, and to transfer technology to rural areas 40Millennium Development Goals, Nepal Progress Report 2002, HMG/N and United Nations County Team of Nepal.Nepal243The use of the Internet shall be extended to rural areas Content shall be prepared to enhance Nepali materials on the Internet to preserve Nepali arts and culture as well as to developrural areas In an effort to implement these policies and strategies the project is prepared to solicit grant assistance from donors for the implementation of this project. III. THE PROPOSED PROJECT Goal: Securing the right to sustainable livelihoods of rural and urban poor. Purpose: Improved use of information by people at large. A. Purposes (or objectives) Decentralized local governance Public-private partnership Right based approach: Right to information Social inclusion Poverty alleviation Lessons learnt from the RUPP B. Scope of the project, components, methodology and key activities E-governanceThe project will support the Government and the local bodies in undertaking a number of measures to extend e-governance services. This project will also help implement the Self-Help Local Governance Act, in which the responsibilities of municipalities and the Village DevelopmentCommittees (VDCs) are defined. The project approach will be based on local demand and self-sustaining mechanisms to help the people improve their livelihoods. All the applications will be developed and implementedon the e-governance web site, but given the limited time for the pilot project, it is advisable at this stage to focus on a subset of them in order to be able to demonstrate their impact. E-commerceThe activities of pilot implementation in the e-commerce arena will revolve around current business-to-business (B2B) initiatives of RUPP. Enhancements will be made in the current user interface of B2B portal along with incorporation of monitoring and data mining facilities. Asegment on auctions and spot marketing will also be incorporated. A vertical B2B model around a specific product category will also be developed by forming alliances with institutions like Agriculture EnterprisesCentre (AEC) and Women Entrepreneur Association of Nepal (WEAN) during the piloting and will be integrated into current B2B initiative of RUPP. The fact remains however that e-commerce is more about businessmodels and strategies than about technology.Nepal244The focus of the project will therefore be on close monitoring of current B2B initiative with a view to ascertaining whether it embracesappropriate and feasible business models and to what extent it has been able to create a value to its key stakeholders and foster rural-urban linkages. This will require close coordination with Tole/Lane Organisation (TLO) members,local chapters of Chamber of Commerce and Industries (CCI) and Federationof Nepalese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI/AEC).

INTRODUCTION The Philippines is a geographically diverse country, separated by seas and mountain ranges. The Philippines has the basic infrastructure for transportation and communication. Necessary communications facilities are also in place in most of the areas, though still wanting in some remote areas. In general, information technology (IT) facilities are still inaccessibleto people living in rural areas. These people do not have basic services and need to travel long distances just to avail of long distance telephone service, Internet access and e-learning, among other services. Telephone andInternet providers are still low with concentration in the urban areas due to low affordability of consumers in the rural areas. Key government organizations or sectors involved in the community e-centre (CeC) development are the Department of Transportation andCommunication (DOTC), Department of Science and Technology (DOST), Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) and private Non- Government Organizations. II. BACKGROUND, ISSUES AND RATIONALE While the Government has realized that Information and Communi- cation Technology (ICT) is critical to national and economic developmentand is therefore a key to eliminating poverty in rural areas, the develop- ment of CeCs in the Philippines, particularly in the rural areas, is hindered by the following existing issues: Funding Financial resources from the national and local government as well as from donors are limited. ICT related expenditures comprise a very minimal percentage of the key government agencies involved in ICT development. Forinstance, around Pesos 235,000 (US$ 4,196) or 0.003 per cent of the total DOTC budget was allotted for municipal telecentres in 2003. 41 The limited funding restricts the development of necessary infra- structure facilities and efforts to promote ICT in the local levels. 41Source: 2003 GAAPhilippines248Selective coverage of private sector and non-government organizations While the private sector and non-government organizations have demonstrated high levels of interest in bridging the gap in communities not accessed by national ICT by initiating ICT in the barangays or localcommunities, it is observed that these initiatives are on a very selectivebasis and primarily focused on cities or its barangays. Understandably, theprivate sector and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have their ownpolicies and standards. Due to fiscal constraints, besides the limited government funding/ budget, the Government managed to solicit grant assistance from CanadianInternational Development Agency (CIDA) and International Research De-velopment Council (IRDC) of Canada and United Nation Education, Scien-tific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) for the propagation of CeCs. Despite of this, CeCs are still limited in the country. The Government of Japan also gave a grant for the acquisition of personal computers for the Public High Schools Project (Phase I and II)amounting to US$ 21,147,591 to install 38,600 PCs for 1,994 schools in2002 and 2003. Acceptance of the concept/fear of technology Due to the limited educational level of the potential users at the local barangays they are resistant to learn new technologies. This is particularly trueto those living in the truly remote areas or lower class municipalities. Thissituation further impedes the development of ICT in the country. This is true even if the necessary hardware facilities are provided by donors. Harmonization of responsibilities in the development of ICT/CeCs There are several organizations involved in the development of ICT, for example, DOTC (Telecommunication Office) and DOST (National Computer Center, Philippines Council for Health Research and Development), without well defined area of responsibilities. This results in fragmented and selectivedevelopment of ICTs in areas outside Metro Manila. This can also slow downthe appetite of the private sector and NGOs in pursuing active participation inICT development in the country. This also results in the overlapping of benefits. There is a legislation pending in Congress regarding the creation of the Department of Information and Communications Technology. Information data system The necessary information may not be available. For instance, neces- sary agriculture or trade data must be put in place to make the ICT useful in spurring developments at the local level. There is more room for improvementfor the Pricewatch web site from the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)and the Bantay Presyo (Pricewatch) of the Department of Agriculture (DA) tocommensurate with the needs of farmers and fishermen. Infrastructure facilities/connectivity The digital infrastructure is present but the country being an archi- pelago makes the provision of digital access in rural, remote and un-servedPhilippines249areas, complex. In addition, telephone and Internet services are concentrated in urban areas because of affordability problems of those in the rural areas.In general, IT facilities are still inaccessible to people living in rural areas since they still have to travel long distance to avail of long distance telephone service, Internet access and e-learning among others. 42 III. THE PROPOSED PROJECT A. Purposes (or objectives) The project has the main goal of bringing communication across lower income class municipalities in the Philippines to reduce poverty level in the country. From this main goal and building on the several issues confronting the development of the CeCs in the Philippines stems the following specific purposes of this project: Fuel economic activity in the municipalities resulting from ac-cess to relevant information on basic agricultural and other trading commodities Cheaper way of communicating overseas Improved educational standards in the lower income areas through access to wider information and various educational and research materials Active participation of private sector in the ICT development Empowerment of local communities and grass root levels so- cially, politically and economically Accelerate the deployment and expansion of ICT infrastructureacross the country especially to un-served and underserved areas to achieve universal access at affordable cost, and with the private sector and NGOs playing a major role Appreciation and awareness by local government units (LGUs)and constituents of lower income municipalities including those in the grassroots level The project is expected to have the following deliverables:1. A report with recommendations addressing the following: Harmonization of the roles and responsibilities of the various national Government agencies involved in ICT development without the need for legislation. Identification of interim actions on issues whose final solution would still require legislation Identification of strategically located pilot sites of ruralcommunity e-centres for every province as well as the hardware, software and organizational requirements of these pilot sites Cost sharing scheme between the LGUs and the users in-cluding the test period when use of the facilities at the pilot centres can be given for free 42Source: ITECC Roadmap 2003Philippines250Identification of prospective sites of subsequent CeCs in the lower income municipalities following the test /pilot areas Identification of municipalities still wanting the necessary ICT infrastructure facilities, including the appropriate infra- structure facilities/technology necessary or applicable Recommendation on the necessary enabling environment to further promote and sustain the participation of the private sector and NGO in the development of the ICT in the low income municipalities Public-private partnership model for the establishment of CeCs in the rural areas in the Philippines Prospective municipalities recipients of the project loan com- ponent of this project including the allocation of loan into specific purposes and the conduit organizations (e.g. national Government, Government financial institutions, municipalfund corporation) Needed improvement in the web sites of key governmentagencies, which are important to low income municipalitiesparticularly at the grassroot level (e.g. Department of Agri- culture, Department of Health, Department of Trade and Industry, Department of Education) Improvement in the curriculum of public schools to prepare the students at the lower income level or grassroots to ICT including the needed hardware and software Appreciation and awareness by LGUs and constituents of lowerincome municipalities including those in the grass root level Further legislation and policy framework necessary tocomplement the recommendations 2.

The first phase shall provide the preparatory work including establishment of pilot centres and shall bePhilippines251primarily funded by grant and concerned government counterpart. The second phase shall involve the preparation of feasibility for subsequent e-centres all over the country providing at least 50 per cent of municipalities for eachprovince with e-centres including the establishment of e-centres found to be feasible as well as the provision of additional infrastructure facilities. This will be funded primarily by loan and private sector participation. The project will require international and domestic consultants, expert on the following fields: information technology, local government finance,economics, financial analysis, planning, and institutional development. The consultant will undertake specific activities to achieve the desired outputs of these projects: Define responsibilities and harmonize functions of the several agencies/organization involved in ICT including the identifica- tion of responsible agencies for various private sector initiatives Review of the Barangay.Net model and the World Corp models and their effectiveness and sustainability as well as the needed improvements, if any, to better suit the needs of the lowerincome municipalities as well as achieve a more effective pub- lic-private partnership in CeC in the rural areas Clustering of municipalities taking into account the income classes of the municipality, geographical dispersion, and the availability ofthe necessary infrastructure or network facilities/technology Identification of basic information needed by constituents of lowincome communities including those in the grass root levels anddetermination of gaps in the available information at the web sites of key government agencies Review of the educational curriculum and identify gaps as it concerns development of information technology Determine avenues on how the ICT can be better appreciatedand understood by those in the grass root level Institutional development/capacity building of potential users in- cluding the local government officials Determination of present role of the private sector and NGOs in ICT development, particularly in the rural areas.

Sustainability, viability and expected impact This project is expected to have high social, economic and financial impact in view of the expected growth in economic development in the countryside and reduction in poverty level resulting from faster and wider access to information and communications technology. The expected risk onthe social side is the use of ICT to access unwanted information, from theInternet, particularly by the youth.

INTRODUCTION The main objective underlying the establishment of community e-centres (CeCs) in rural areas is to take information and communication technologies(ICTs) to enhance the living conditions of the rural population. It also aims tocreate and promote awareness among the rural masses and enabling them toparticipate actively in the process of creating a fair and equitable informationsociety, which can directly contribute to national development. The improve- ment of the ICT infrastructure facilities in rural area has been identified as a long held need of Sri Lanka. Therefore, successive governments have given toppriority to the development of the ICT sector in the country. The development of infrastructure facilities is a prerequisite for establishment and operation of community e-centres (CeCs). The non- availability of the infrastructure has adversely affected the current status ofthe CeCs in rural areas. This was due to the fact that the main telecomproviders in Sri Lanka have not taken their service out to the rural areasowing to the lack of profitability. The Information and CommunicationTechnology Agency (ICTA), which is the Government body responsible for implementing the development initiatives, has a key role to play in building the infrastructure. The vision of the information infrastructure programmeshould be to see every Sri Lankan citizen having ready and affordableaccess to information and knowledge, government services, education,health care, agricultural information through modern communication. Currently, there are some CeCs already operating in Sri Lanka covering the rural areas. These multi-purpose CeCs, stationed in rural areaswith basic IT facilities, are available for the rural poor people. A trainedyouth in the village is appointed as human interface to contract with ruralpeople and this youth provide a solution to the language barriers. II. BACKGROUND, ISSUES AND RATIONALE There is no doubt that CeCs have a major role to play in the process of economic development of the country. It is hoped that CeCs willcontribute toward solving important development challenges faced by the rural sector in Sri Lanka. The issues and challenges that may have adverse impact on the economic development can be identified as the low rate ofeconomic growth, high level of unemployment, unequal distribution of wealthand the high percentage of poverty. Despite the impressive achievement insocial welfare and economic development, the poverty level in the countryremains high with 28 per cent of population living below the poverty line. The poor in rural areas are caught up in vicious cycle of poverty, malnutrition, diseases and loss of output. Basically inequality in distributionSri Lanka256of assets hinders economic development. The distribution of wealth and income has a major impact an output and investment. The populationpressure in rural areas has compounded these problems. The only way to ensure a better living condition for the poor is through sustainable develop- ment leading to increased income, employment and equal opportunities toachieve a better quality of life. The majority of the people living in ruralareas of Sri Lanka have little or no access to even the basic telecommunica-tion facilities. This is primarily due to the high cost of constructingcommunication infrastructure in these areas coupled with the low estimated revenue from providing services. The Government of Sri Lanka is not able to invest on major ICT project due to the lack of funds in the balance ofpayment account and the deficit in the annual budget. The return on investment (ROI) of the ICT sector is far below the market rate of interest or the opportunity cost of investment. The people in the country have used traditional practices over generations. Therefore, they are resistant to changes taking place worldwide. Currently, most computer operating systems, databases and applications in Sri Lanka run only in English. However, most Sri Lankans are more familiar withSinhala or Tamil and would prefer to use IT in their own language. III. THE PROPOSED PROJECT A. Purposes (or objectives) The rationale behind the project is to identify the problems faced by the country today and to find the ways and means of solving these problems through CeCs. The project aims to establish a network of CeCs in the most under-serviced regions of the country. These centres have to be operated on income generating basis as no such programme can be sus- tained without having operating income to continue such services. This project is developed to create awareness and apply ICTs to bridge the \"Digital Divide\" though the information society or e-society. It covers acquisition, storage, processing, transmission, distribution and use of infor- mation to enhance the knowledge of society for better quality of life. The establishment of CeCs at the provincial and district levels will be carried out during the first phase and the establishment of CeCs at the provincial level will be carried out during the second stage. The purpose of establishing CeCs are to: Ensure better price through market information Increase output levels through dissemination of improved cul- tural practices Provide information on seed material, weather conditions, andtechnical know-how Reduce isolation and marginalization Increase health conditions through information available over the Internet This project could be implemented in two phases.Sri Lanka257B. Scope of the project, components, methodology and key activities The e-Sri Lanka initiatives of the Government of Sri Lanka recog- nized that an important element for poverty and under-development is the lack of access to information. The initiative will harness the benefit of ICTtowards achieving the overall objectives of poverty reduction, peace build-ing and socio-economic development. ICTA of Sri Lanka is the government agency responsible for imple- menting the e-Sri Lanka initiative. Through the establishment of the two Regional Telecommunications Networks (RTNs), ICTA will provide connec-tivity to two of the most under-served regions of the country, the north-east andthe deep south. willl be 100 Vishwa Gnana Kendras (VGKs) or CeCsestablished within these two regions. These centres will not only have Internetfacility, they will be provided with local content relevant for the community such as agri-information, weather forecasts, and e-learning material. The goal of setting up of e-centres is to enable backward districts to achieve a rapid and sustainable rate of economic growth, which willespecially help the poor and vulnerable groups to join the main stream ofeconomic development. Performance indicators/targets The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) studies reveal that there is wide inter-district variation in the standard of living and thepoverty levels. The performance indicators that can be used are: 1. Consumption of calories per person 2. Income level improvements3. Reduction in unemployment4. Number of Internet users Monitoring The monitoring mechanisms that can be developed are People Orga- nizations in various districts, which can be harnessed by the e-centreproject. Another monitoring mechanism is to use the divisional administra-tion at the regional level to monitor progress through pre-designed perfor-mance appraisal format.

Implementation arrangements This project aims to use ICTs to foster social integration, peace, growth and poverty reduction. The government body responsible for imple- menting development initiative is the ICTA which functions as the single apex body involved in ICT policy and direction for the nation. The Samurdhi movement which was established by the Government to implement a poverty elevation programme in 1994 has setup 1,035Samurdhi banks all over the island. All these banks are operated under the supervision of divisional and sistrict secretaries. Over 2.1 million poor have already taken membership of Samurdhi bank. Out of this, 62 per cent arewomen. Samurdhi bank societies have been established at the district levelunder the supervision of district secretaries. This could be a successfulnetwork to help set up CeCs in rural areas. D.

INTRODUCTION Sri Lanka is an island nation of 62,705 square kilometres with a multi- ethnic, multi-religious population of 19.7 million as of 2003, and with 80 percent of the population living in rural areas. Sri Lanka, for purpose ofadministration and development, is divided into nine provinces and 25districts. The nine provinces have been formed into eight provincial councils,having merged the north-east province into one provincial council. Informa-tion and communication technology (ICT) facilities reached this countrycomparatively late, and up till now have not spread to the rural areas. The north-east province, in this regard, is still in a disadvantageous position because of the internal conflict of twenty years. A quasi-peace isnow being experienced in this area, with an MOU between the Governmentand the Tamil Tigers signed in 2002. Computer skills were introducedduring this period and the younger generations are being educated. ICTfacilities are available but are very limited, with only capitals of districts inthis province having them. Therefore, awareness, knowledge and access toICT facilities in rural communities are very low. Informal discussions withrural community leaders and youths revealed that they are anxious topossess ICT facilities in their villages and through which share globalchanges in the fields of education and socio-economic development. II. BACKGROUND, ISSUES AND RATIONALE Challenges facing rural communities include: 1. Damaged socio-economic, community infrastructures including basic amenities; 2.

The resettlementand rehabilitation of the displaced people has still not been fulfilled and thelegacy of the war still hangs over the heads of the people. Agriculture, fisheries and related activities are the chief livelihood of rural communities. People and their activities have suffered immensely dueto damages sustained to resources and equipment. Since ICT is only nowbeing introduced, knowledgeable and trained persons are not available in reasonable numbers. Enormous amounts of investment are needed to reha- bilitate, improve socio-economic infrastructure, and to develop rural areasto facilitate and to build community e-centres (CeCs). III. THE PROPOSED PROJECT A. Purposes (or objectives) Global linking through ICT has brought forth remarkable changes among the people, particularly among the rural people in several thirdworld countries that have been struck with poverty, lack of education andill health. The situation in Sri Lanka, particularly in the north-east province is not much better. Building CeCs in Sri Lanka will, it is anticipated, bring changes for betterment of the rural population. B. Scope of the project, components, methodology and key activities Resettlement and rehabilitation, the creation of confidence of security among the people, and educating them on the advantages of ICT are verynecessary to achieve the benefits of e-centres. A breakdown in the peace is therisk that could disturb the project and the continuous usage of e-centres. C. Implementation arrangements It is proposed to involve a selected CBO in the e-centre area to function under the monitoring of the divisional secretary. Resource persons will train selected suitable people in the area to operate the centre. The duration is six months, during which seminars will be conducted for selected rural people about the effects, impacts and advantages of ICT and CeCs. D.

INTRODUCTION A policy framework for Thailand's information and communication technology (ICT) development for the year 2001-2010, IT2010, was en-dorsed by the cabinet in March 2002. IT2010 has set the key developmentobjectives to move Thailand towards a knowledge-based society andeconomy. The specific strategy, which is one of seven strategies, is the utilization of ICT to enhance the quality of life and society, emphasizing the development and application of the equitable information infrastructurefor areas such as rural communities. In October 2002, the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology (MICT) was established. It is responsible for the implementa-tion as well as monitoring and evaluation of the plan. One of MICT'smissions is to reduce the digital divide in the rural area by putting ICT inplaces where rural people can use them to improve their quality of life and also to add value to the local economy. It is clear that the community members can use ICT to improve the quality of life and become a knowledge-based society. II. BACKGROUND, ISSUES AND RATIONALE The population of Thailand is nearly 63 million in which 70 per cent live in rural areas. Thailand has 76 provinces and approximately 790Districts, 7,000 Subdistrict and 70,000 villages. In order to provide accessto information and knowledge, several organizations have initiated commu-nity e-centres (CeCs) projects using different approaches. Existing examples of CeCs in rural areas are: CeCs (officially closed and fully managed by villagers): four pilot telecentres in rural areas Public Internet access to under-served areas: 300 public Internetbooths in major areas Broadband e-learning project through His Majesty the King'sproject (on-going): 35 schools in rural areas nationwide One temple-one e-learning centre (initiated in March 2004): ninetelecentres will be setup in five areas of Thailand by 2005Thailand264Thailand has several organizations working on e-community concepts but there are still thousands villages left out. There are few success cases where the villagers can run community telecentres without help from the Government. Some cases fail because the telecentre were neglected. There are several factors that has been learned and can be used to improve new telecentre projects, but unfortunately there is no complete report on what has been going on. In this situation, MICT needs to make a lot of efforts to gather information, and to analyze lessons learned in order to continue building more CeCs for people in rural areas as well as to reduce the digital divide as stated in the IT2010. Collaboration between public and private sectors, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and academic institutes must be beyond what had been done in the past. It is important to integrate CeC projects among Government agencies to avoid duplicated efforts. Also Thailand is under some constraints such as the limitation of budget for ICT. As of January 2004, approximately 10,000 villages in rural Thailand still do not have access to the basic telephony services. Thousands of schools, libraries, hospitals, health-care units, local community centres, and small business in rural areas are currently demanding CeC services. III. THE PROPOSED PROJECT In order to decrease the digital divide between urban and rural areas, Thailand should have a specific organization that is responsible for CeCs and coordinate with 20 ministries and the six other central agencies. The MICT should take this matter seriously according to the strategy that has been set. A. Purposes (or objectives) As the MICT is a new ministry, one of the objectives of the project is to gather information about CeCs in Thailand that have been established in the past four years. Since there is no dedicated organization in develop- ing the CeCs, information gathering is one of the very first things to do. Maintaining and restoring existing CeCs is also important because once the Government or project donors stop funding, the CeC stops functioning as well in many cases. The project is to find suitable methods for rural areas to make the centres more sustainable. The project framework has two goals. One is to set up MICT to be the focal organization and coordinating agency with 20 ministries and approximately 280 agencies in developing CeCs in both urban and rural areas. Another goals is to set up 152 CeCs in 76 provinces to provide access to information and knowledge to improve the quality of life and economic condition of the villagers in the rural areas. C. Implementation arrangements The MICT should be the focal point for CeCs in Thailand. By encouraging and coordinating with all ministries and government agencies on the telecentre concept in rural areas, it will help to bridge the digital divide.Thailand265Seeking outside assistance is helpful to the project. The private sector could be useful in terms of investment and local businesses. NGOs could behelpful in providing information and news, relevant to local communities. Government agencies and universities will be the main information produc- ers, providing information such as farm market prices, weather forecasts andrelevant knowledge for the community. Raising information technology (IT)awareness is not only for the people who live in the rural areas but also forgovernment officers at the policy-making level. In the first phase, 152 telecentres will be established in every province of Thailand. According to the \"one tambon-one product (OTOP)\" project ofthe central government, one telecentre will be set up in the village that caters to business users and another one will be set up that will have less involvement with businesses. After some time, it is hoped that the study of this project canhelp in developing sustainable models for telecentres in rural villages. Themodel could then be adopted by the similar villages in the nearby provinces. Finally, all telecentres will be connected to the Government system which will provide them with useful information and services. D. Cost and financing (US$ million) Thailand financing plan is strictly controlled by the Bureau of Budget, annual requirements for counterpart funds need to be carefully examined in advance by staff to ensure that adequate counterpart funds areavailable when project activities are initiated. There are some communication infrastructure projects that have been funded by the Government. Hence, most grants usually help in the areas ofstudy. It is clear that starting by gathering information about CeCs thatalready have been established by various agencies will be a good start forthe MICT. With the information, the MICT can make plans more effective and have enough information to enhance the development of a better telecentre that will be set up in the next phase. The cost estimates toachieve the proposed project are in the following table. There is an expectation that this project will return with the right answer to deliver information and services to the rural communities. Inturn, the villagers also can do the marketing for their local products andtourism can increase, bringing more income as well. (US$ million) Item Government Donors Total cost 1. Consultant a.

Sustainability, viability and expected impact It is expected that the project will achieves all objectives of CeCs which are: Community empowerment Providing access to information and communication Enhancing market opportunity for local products and tourist attractions Enhancing learning opportunities for people in remote areas Bridging the digital divide Poverty reduction by increasing household income Finally, the success of this project will encourage Thailand to go forward towards a knowledge-based society and economy in the next few years.

Saifnazarov, Deputy Head, Division of Communication and IT, Ministry of Economy Country: UzbekistanDate: December 2004 I. INTRODUCTION Postal communication is an integral part of the economic and social infrastructure of Uzbekistan. However, global changes have necessitatedchanges in the postal and communication field too; so by the decree of the Government, a joint-stock company \"Uzbekistan Pochtasi\" was created. Achieving its activity under the new transition period of the economy and the country's independence, the open joint-stock company \"Uzbekistan Pochtasi\" has been able to preserve unity of the postal communication network and its system controllability. The company functions as the interconnected production complex, intended to satisfy the needs of population, economic subjects, state structures and other legal and physical individuals in both traditional postal communica-tion services, and in new types of services, which combine the achievement of the new technology and the transmission of postage using ICT. According to the decree, 75 per cent of company's shares remain as the State's property, 10 per cent is intended to sell to employees and 15 per cent of shares are for open trade. Currently all shares intended for sale among employees and in the open trade are totally sold. Uzbekistan Pochtasi consists of 14 territorial joint-stock companies, including 189 district and urban knots, 3,012 branches of connection, including 2,322 rural branches, joint stock company \"International Post\",\"Postmark of Uzbekistan\", and \"International Express Mail\". There are 38 airline routes, 387 automobile routes, one railroad post route, which ensures regular (daily) transportation of mail. II. BACKGROUND, ISSUES AND RATIONALE Uzbekistan Pochtasi carries out postal communication and exchange with all countries of the world by all types of mail, and carries out obligationsof the Republic in accordance with the World Postal Union's regulations. More than 10 alternative operators and providers are working in the market of postal services. However they provide only highly beneficial services of theinternational mail service in the capital city of Tashkent. At the same time, the comparative analysis shows that average speed of letter delivery in the territory of the republic is slower than in the manyother countries: within the European Union 80 per cent of mail is delivered within three days, in Germany 95 per cent is delivered next day from the moment of sending. However, in Uzbekistan, 95 per cent of the writtenUzbekistan269correspondences are delivered within 3 days only between the regional centres; to other settlements, the written correspondence takes 10 days to reach the receiver. Such quality of service provided by the national operatordoes not satisfy the majority of users, which leads to a decrease in the number of personal and business mail sent. The problems of Uzbekistan Pochtasi are predetermined by a low level of technological development in the postal services area. Rates of post infrastructure upgrading do not correspond to modern requirements and standards. During years of 2000-2001, only US$ 400,000 of capital investment was allocated for the development of national postal network operator, while developed countries spend far more on these purposes. According to comments of experts, involved in the grant of US Trade and Development Agency, to create a corporate information-communication network for the national postal operator, it would need to invest at least US$ 31 million. Another problem is the low qualification of the staff working in this sector. Among 14,900 workers, only 6.7 per cent have higher education qualifications, 31.4 per cent have special technical education, and the rest have the secondary education level. The main goal of this programme is to introduce and implement ICT and a postal infrastructure, which will offer access to information resources to provide modern communication services, and optimize mail service network of the national operator. In order to achieve specified goals, it is provided stage-by-stage creation of a modern corporate network for data transmission, updating non-capital assets, solving the problem of personnel maintenance with the qualified experts and attraction of investments. III. THE PROPOSED PROJECT A. Purposes (or objectives) The programme is to develop the national postal service provider's network by introducing automation of production and finding new segments of the market in communication services to bring about an essential increase in income. B. Scope of the project, components, methodology and key activities The basic direction is a stage-by-stage creation of a corporate network of data transmission based on modern IT, equipping divisions with modern computer technologies, and also with postal and specific equipment. At the initial stage (2005-2006), it is planned to create 15 regional branches, 189 local, 622 city and rural mail service branches and corre- sponding workplaces of telecommunication system, connecting all branches to the central office. At the second stage (2007-2010), 1,865 city and rural mail service branches will be integrated into the created corporate network. In subsequent stages, it is planned to gradually connect to this network the maximum number of postal communication branches. At theUzbekistan270same time, the communication branches will be equipped with computer and other necessary technologies to implement new, more profitable and demand-driven services. C. Implementation arrangements Realization of a new technological platform will allow not only diversification of the business of Uzbekistan Pochtasi, but will also make available more traditional services in a modern way. For these purposes, with funding from donors, a feasibility report was developed on modernization of the network of the national operator based on IT technologies, which will attract investments and credits of about US$ 31,000,000. As a result of optimization and increases in efficiency of invest- ments, the project's cost is reduced to US$ 11,400,000, which is expected to be financed by foreign banks and financial institutions. Since therealization of all projects will be carried out on a tender/auction basis, it is possible to reduce the cost of the project by 20 per cent. D. Cost and financing (US$) It is intended to attract financial support for the basic parts of the programme from internal and external banks and financial institutions, and also from private funds of Uzbekistan Pochtasi. The partial financing for the fixed capital renovation is provided by the Non-budgetary Fund for the Development of Information - Communica-tion Technologies, which will also cover transportation costs, preparation and the retraining of employees, and also compensation of initial costs of regular outfit and bicycles for the postal workers. Private funds of Uzbekistan Pochtasi will be directed toward equip- ment renovation expenditures, post furniture and also returning drawn credits, including from foreign banks.

INTRODUCTION Viet Nam is an agricultural country and agriculture plays an impor- tant role for the development of socio-economy of the nation. In recentyears, the Government of Viet Nam has made suitable policies and mecha-nism for rural development aiming at reducing poverty and creating liveli-hood for the poor in rural areas and facilitating them in agricultureproduction so the people can keep their sustainable life. The agriculture of Viet Nam has gained a big achievement with annual growth rate of 5.7 per cent contributing positively to food security programme, supplying moremajor agricultural products for processing industry and for export, andstabilizing the socio-economic life of the people in the whole country. The target of the Government for the coming years is quick conver- sion of agriculture production and rural economy mechanism: closely connecting domestic and oversea markets; development of specialized prod-uct production areas with high and sustainable production capacity forexport based on the potential and advantages of each area. For that, theapplication of new technology and science in rural and remote areas, thetransfer of technology free of charge for the poor, investment for develop- ment of plant and animal varieties in the poor commune, carrying out the training courses for the poor on technique of animal feeding and cultivationare vital, and it will serve the objective of poverty reduction and hungerelimination in the area where around 90 per cent of the poor are living. Through community e-centres (CeCs), farmers and people can approach information on new technologies, application of agriculture extension services, and protection of products after harvesting and process more agricultureproducts. These play a very important role in increasing the quality andproductivity of the agricultural products and improving incomes of the peopleand the lives of farmers, assisting farmers to increase the value of agricultureproducts and to meet the requirement of the domestic and export markets. II. BACKGROUND, ISSUES AND RATIONALE In recent years, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) has been implementing projects and programmes and other activitiesfor rural development. For the improvement of public service and informationexchange among agencies under MARD and with other agencies of the Government, and provision of information on agriculture extension services and natural disaster prevention to the farmers, MARD carries out a number ofViet Nam272activities, including implementing a pilot network of telecentres within the framework of the Public Administrative Reform Programme funded by theUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP). To improvement the current information exchange system, the fol- lowing is needed: Establishment of a uniform policy on connecting all staff using MARD's computer into the domain for supply governance of thesystem to control and prevent users from arbitrarily setting upprogrammes or configuration The server of MARD needs to be equipped with preventive system to solve problems, which may harm the hardware Improve the reliance, sustainability and confidence of the server system and individual computers, some software needs to beinstalled as software update service back up software, increasinghard disk capacity and ramdom access memory (RAM) Individual computers need to be connected into the domain for management of individual computer system, control or supply service and resources from server system to all individual computers Improvement of Internet and Intranet by installation of softwareto limit or control level of bandwidth for users and install anabstract-type and scheme-definition language (ASDL) for dedi-cated Internet users III. THE PROPOSED PROJECT A. Purposes (or objectives)Project goal : Implementation of a national strategy for socio-economy develop- ment and poverty reduction in central region. Objectives : Delivering and sharing useful information service based on farmer's needs, priorities and opportunities that aims for improving agricultureproduction conditions, increasing their incomes, and contributing to agricul- ture and rural development and poverty reduction. It should also assist farmers to access the information system for natural disaster prevention. Output 1: Establishment of 10 community e-centres (CeCs) Activity 1.1: Recruiting operators for 10 CeCs Activity 1.2: Procuring equipment for 10 CeCs Output 2: Capacity building for operators of CeCs and staff at central and local levels Activity 2.1: Preparing a manual for running a CeC, including procedures for monitoring its operation Activity 2.2: Conducting a training course on: (1) use of computer; (2) method of prevention of natural disaster especiallyfor flood and storm; (3) searching for information; and (4) running CeCsViet Nam273Activity 2.3: Organizing experience-sharing workshop Output 3: Information supplying channels developed Activity 3.1: Establishing a central information desk Activity 3.2: Establishing cooperation team and mechanism with information sources Activity 3.3: Establishing a library of books, video/VCDs in the central information coordination unit and CeCs Activity 3.4: Developing a list of information sourcesActivity 3.5: Contacting and studying information sources Output 4: Information distribution channels developed Activity 4.1: Strengthening common interest group/extension club Activity 4.2: Developing form of bulletins Activity 4.3: Issuing bulletins regularlyActivity 4.4: Developing a form to receive requires/requests from farmers Activity 4.5: Processing queries from farmers B. Scope of the project, components, methodology and key activities With regards to the selection of the place for project implementation, the Government of Viet Nam is concentrating on the central region because itis the poorest region with a poverty rate of 38 per cent, especially when thestandard of US$ 115/person/year based on the poverty and poor map (2003) isapplied. In this case, about 35 per cent the population in Quang Ngai and 63 per cent in Thanh Hoa province are classified as being poor. Therefore, 10 CeCs will be established in the provinces of Quang Ngai and Thanh Hoa. Both Thanh Hoa and Quang Ngai suffer from the effects of natural disasters, such as heavy floods and storms. The provision of informationconcerning forecasting of natural disasters and measures for prevention to the farmers in a timely fashion has been implemented by the MARD. However, in the storm and flood season, the provision of information to the peoplemeets many difficulties. Building CeCs will support, considerably, naturaldisaster mitigation if the people can access information by themselves. In the past, the provision of information on application on new technology and agriculture extension services to the farmers has been provided through the training programmes or meetings organized by localagriculture extension centres and agricultural cooperatives respectively.These meetings often take time and depend on the resource persons and theschedule of the local agencies. Moreover, the participants in the trainingsand meetings are often the representative of household, but not all the members of their family. If CeCs are established, all farmers can access information equally, and it can help them changing the way they farm. TheCeCs can also help not only the farmers, especially for the farmers incoastal areas, but also the farmers in towns so that they can respond in amore timely fashion to potential damages caused by natural disasters. In Viet Nam, one of the big advantages of building CeCs in rural areas is the large labour force, and the greater cohesiveness of farmingViet Nam274communities. The degree of understanding and the capability for receiving new technology is rather high, especially amongst the young labour force inrural areas. Up to 2005, the Government will widen the national power grid ensuring 90 per cent of poor communities have access to electricity. C. Implementation arrangements Organization structure for operation of the CeCs is proposed as follows: Central level: Agencies under the MARD including the informatics centre, the information support division, theinformatics bureau, the national agriculture extension centre, theinternational cooperation department, science and technologydepartment and project management unit Local level: Department of agriculture and rural development, local project management units, CeCs Beneficiaries: Farmers and farmer households The consultant will support the development of information supply- ing channels concerning the agriculture extension services, provide software and train local staff in using information management software. Theconsultant will also train the staff at central and local levels on how tooperate CeCs and support monitoring and evaluation of the project. The facilities will vary depending upon the services that the centre provide. Based on some feasibility models, the most effective alternativemust be in line with the services selected. The facilities for community e-centres include: computer, modem, network, fax machine, printer, photo-copy machine, television, video player, CD writer, telephone, digital cam-era, scanner, furniture, newsletter, newspapers, books, guide and speakers. Each CeCs will need to have three operators. One will be the manager of the centre. This person must have management capability, someagriculture background and high credibility in the community and have towork full time, depending on the workload of the centre in each commu- nity. A second operator will be the community mobilizer. This person must have experience in working with community and high credibility in thecommunity and be able to work full time, depending on the workload ofthe centre in each community. The third operator will be a technicalassistant. This person must be young, know how to use advanced technol-ogy, including the Internet. This person can work part time. D.

Sustainability, viability and expected impact To successfully develop CeCs and make it sustainable in rural areas, the following issues should be paid attention to: The network system management, operation mechanism, salaryfor operators, supervising the information application, educationand training, enhance the knowledge of the people and let themto understand the effectiveness of application of new technologyand agriculture technique in agricultural production When carrying out training courses for the farmers, traineesshould have certain level of instruction so that they can betrained to improve their knowledge in informatics, and theyshould have capability to access information. For thesustainability of centres, they should have autonomy in financewhile the community should be willing to pay for servicesprovided by the centres After the project is implemented, it can increase the farmers'capability to access and apply information for improved produc-tion and quality of life To reach these objectives, it is necessary to expand the network of CeCs to the local level after using the lessons learned from the pilotimplementation. Regarding finance and technology, it needs to be supportedby an experienced international organization and bilateral cooperation aim-ing at formulating projects for development of CeCs. CeCs can operateefficiently and bring real benefits to farmers by increasing production,improve the lives of people in rural areas and maintain sustainable opera-tion of community e-centres.Viet Nam Item Government Donors Total cost 2.
