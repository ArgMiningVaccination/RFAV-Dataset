The following is a list of some of the overall benefits: - No Side Effects or Pain - Highly Effective for Patient (90% efficacy) - Non-Toxic - Non-Invasive - Extremely Safe - Virtually No Contra-Indications Electric Stimulation Therapy How it Works- Electrical stimulation uses an electrical current to cause a single muscle or a group of muscles to contract. The settings can be changed to allow for a forceful or gentle muscle contraction. Along with increasing muscle strength, the contraction of the muscle also promotes blood supply to the area that assists in healing. Treatment Time is generally applied for 15-20 minutes per sessions. The number of sessions can vary per condition and severity, but noticeable results are generally noted within a few visits. What it Can Help- Electric Stimulation Therapy is used for alleviating pain, reduce spasms, strengthen muscles, and improve circulation and range of motion. Electrical stimulation therapy has also been used to treat a variety of conditions from sprains, strains, arthritis, sciatica, tension caused by stress, headaches, fibromyalgia and scoliosis. Ultrasound Therapy How it Works- Ultrasound Therapy is a painless procedure, and many people find it relaxing. Ultrasound is applied using a wand or probe put in direct contact with the skin. It uses the sound waves to deliver deep heat to the treated tissues though usually no heat will be felt by the patient. This results in internal warming to the area as well as increased circulation. Treatment Time is generally applied for 10 minutes per sessions. The number of sessions can vary per condition and severity, but noticeable results are generally noted within a few visits. What it Can Help- Ultrasound therapy is proven to get amazing results when used to minimize muscle pain or quicken the healing time of certain soft tissue (muscle, tendons, and ligaments) injuries. The treatments can also help reduce stiffness, swelling, and pain, increase pain-free movement while breaking down scar tissue. Cold Laser Therapy How it Works- Cold Laser Therapy is a form of medical treatment which involves the use of a low intensity laser to address various soft tissue issues listed below. The laser light is of certain wavelengths which have been studied to have positive healing effects. Lasers can offer focused beams of light which can be used to target their healing effects on specific areas. The application of cold laser is felt by the patient as very mild heat to the targeted area. Treatment Time is very short ranging from 2-6 minutes with noticeable results noted in just a few treatments. What it Can Help- Cold Laser Therapy is similar to both Ultrasound and Electrical stimulation, it has been gaining in popularity for its advanced ability to treat soft tissue strains / sprains, soft tissue pain, swelling, joint problems, reduce scar tissue, inflammation, and arthritis pain.
