Dr Ken Harvey, a physician with La Trobe University's school of public health, has complained to the Therapeutic Goods Administration's complaints panel about a group called Homeopathy Plus! for allegedly promoting immunisations for a range of diseases when there is no scientific evidence to back it up. The group claims on its website that its immunisations are safe and provide the same protection as vaccines, without any of the ''adverse side effects associated with vaccines''. Dr Harvey said he was not concerned about the content of the immunisations - which he said usually resemble placebo drugs - but rather feared they would discourage people from getting vaccinations, especially as Australia had experienced an outbreak of whooping cough this year and was about to roll out its swine flu vaccine. ''There is no evidence these homeopathic immunisations work and, when you start advocating them for malaria, typhoid fever, influenza and measles, frankly, that is very dangerous,'' he said. ''It reinforces people's views that there is an alternative to conventional vaccinations, which overall have been one of the most powerful health interventions we've had to eliminate infectious diseases ... It also preys on the gullibility of people and hurts their hip pockets.'' In his complaint, Dr Harvey alleged that the company had breached the Therapeutic Goods Act and the Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code, and called for the TGA to ban it immediately from promoting its products. Homeopath and spokeswoman for Homeopaths Plus! Fran Sheffield rejected the allegations and said the group was simply providing information to the public about alternatives to vaccines. She said that the immunisations included substances such as water, alcohol and sugar. ''Homeopathy relies on making energetic changes in the body to create immunity, so we're not using viruses, bacteria or chemicals,'' Ms Sheffield said. A spokeswoman for the TGA said it would follow up the complaint and took such reports ''very seriously''. But Dr Harvey said he was not confident the TGA would take any meaningful action. He said the TGA had not in the past imposed any lasting sanctions on others found to be doing the wrong thing by its complaints resolution panel. He said the TGA seemed to be more interested in protecting industries than consumers. ''It's a complaint-driven system that doesn't do anything,'' he said. Dr Rod Pearce, a spokesman for the Australian Medical Association's immunisation working party, said there was no evidence that any homeopathic treatments were effective. ''They are putting lives at risk if they make people think they are protected,'' Dr Pearce said. "}
