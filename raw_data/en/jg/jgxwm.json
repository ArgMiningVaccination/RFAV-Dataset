However, as we all know, this season is like no other that we have experienced in decades. With COVID-19 running rampant in our communities, extra precautions and safety measures are being taken. However, did you know that these precautions do not end with the basics, like face masks and social distancing? There are many ways to prepare your immune system to be at its best for fighting off viruses. One of the biggest ways to work on staying healthy this winter is to make sure your body is getting all the nutrients that it needs. Start with making sure that your diet consists of plenty of water, fruits, vegetables, protein, and other healthy foods. In addition to vamping up your diet, you can add vitamin supplements into your routine, if you have not already. Some opt for a dose of vitamins in a pill form, but you can also get them through injection therapy. Injection therapy is a quick and painless way to add an extra layer of protection to your armor. There are various options available ranging from an immune booster to ozone therapy. All these forms of injections provide aid to your body's immune system and sometimes can be a great alternative to a flu shot. An immune booster, for example, is a monthly treatment that is full of important vitamins like vitamin C, and many B vitamins. While injection therapy is not a vaccine for the flu or COVID-19, it is a great way to make sure your body is running as it should, and it can help to ensure a strong immune system. In addition to checking your diet and nutrients, it is important to stay physically active and healthy. Adding 150 minutes (or 10 minutes a day for 5 days a week), of walking can help to improve circulation, sleep, and cardiovascular health (among many other things). Having a good night's rest is important for maintaining a strong immune system. It is also important to note, that while these are all key benefits of exercise, it may also provide aid to your mental health. Adding some of this exercise into your routine can help to improve overall mood and reduce stress and depression. When we are less stressed and anxious, it is easier to prioritize our physical health. Overall, these are fairly simple steps to help boost your immune system during the pandemic. By doing this you not only are adding an extra layer of security to your life, but you are also making a long-term investment.
