California Wildfire, Rain, Led to Death of Thousands of Klamath River Salmon The Karuk Tribe is blaming a 90-square-mile wildfire in northern California for the deaths of tens of thousands of fish along the Klamath River near Happy Camp, California. They believe that heavy rainfall set off a massive mudslide from the area scorched by the McKinney wildfire, which has decimated more than 233 square kilometers since July 29. The mass of debris flowed into the Klamath River, bringing water oxygen levels to zero, which caused fish to suffocate. For years, the Karuk and Yurok tribes of northern California have fought to protect salmon, which were once abundant in most of the state's major rivers and streams and were central to Klamath tribes' sustenance, spirituality, and economies. But damming, water diversion and climate change have caused a drastic decline in salmon populations. The Karuk Tribe says it's still too early to know whether the fish kill will impact the fall migration of Chinook salmon or areas of the river downstream. Poll: Native Americans Hit Hard by Inflation, Pandemic A [new poll](https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2022/08/NPR-RWJF-Harvard-August-Poll_Final2.pdf) shows that the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation, and political and social divides of the past two years have had a disproportionate impact on Native Americans and other minority groups in the U.S. The poll says 63% of Native Americans today face serious financial problems, compared to Black Americans (55%), Latino Americans (48%) and white Americans (38%). The survey was a joint project of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health along with National Public Radio. It polled nearly 4,200 U.S. adults between May 16 - June 13. \"Millions of minority households across the nation are facing distinct, serious financial problems during this period, including many who are being threatened with eviction and face unsafe conditions in their neighborhoods, with few options to help,\" said study co-director Robert J. Blendon, a professor of public health at Harvard's Chan School. Among the findings: Thirty-nine percent of Native Americans, 32% of Black Americans, 30% of Latino Americans and 13% of Asian American adults are having trouble getting food on the table, compared to 21% of white Americans. Twenty-five percent of Native Americans, 22% of Black Americans, 19% of Latino Americans and 14% of Asian American adults face serious challenges in paying for medical care and prescription drugs; 16% of white Americans cited similar problems with health care access.

Non-resident undergraduate students normally pay $620 per credit hour. Native American student tuition will be reduced to the resident rate of $200 per credit hour. Typically, students take 12 to 15 credits per semester. This means Native American undergraduate students will save up to $19,000 per semester. The Postsecondary National Policy Institute in 2021 estimated that fewer than a quarter of 18-24-year-old Native Americans were enrolled in college, compared to 41% of the overall U.S. population. PSU says it is the only U.S. school to offer tuition discounts to Native American students on a national scale. Earlier this year, the [University of California](https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.opb.org%2Farticle%2F2022%2F04%2F28%2Funiversity-of-california-native-american-students-tuition-wavier%2F&data=05%7C01%7Cchilleary%40VOANews.Com%7C510b04a5802246e5564908da7b520abe%7Cba99e87c673541c2b1c1354eee3a8659%7C0%7C0%7C637957889578061854%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=rCXwAznzD%2Ban%2FjX2RlNPUqJ2cajn0AVqFAX07%2Fnxz5Q%3D&reserved=0) system announced it would waive tuition and fees beginning in fall 2022 for all Native American students who are state residents and members of federally recognized California tribes. Native Americans Give 'Prey' High Scores for Authenticity Native American viewers and critics are applauding the newly released science fiction thriller \"Prey\" for the accuracy of its portrayal of Comanche life on the Great Plains in the early 18th Century. The fifth film in the \"Predator\" movie franchise debuted August 5 on the North American subscription streaming platform, Hulu. It tells the story of the first-ever visit to earth by the terrifying extraterrestrial Predator and the efforts of a hatchet-wielding female warrior Naru, played by Assiniboine, Nakota, Lakota and Dakota actor Amber Midthunder, to track the creature down and destroy it. Film newcomer Dakota Beavers plays Naru's brother Taabe. Director Dan Trachtenberg relied on a team of Comanche experts to give the film its authenticity, including producer Jhane Myers, a citizen of the Comanche Nation in Oklahoma and the [Comanche Language and Cultural Preservation Committee](https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.comanchelanguage.org%2F&data=05%7C01%7Cchilleary%40VOANews.Com%7C510b04a5802246e5564908da7b520abe%7Cba99e87c673541c2b1c1354eee3a8659%7C0%7C0%7C637957889578061854%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=be2I8e97nhtDtbDmXkkJIk5AFieupxlUQt4p7eihGlg%3D&reserved=0).

Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said Wednesday that the \"lease sale itself was seriously flawed and based on a number of fundamental legal deficiencies.\" \"With today's action, no one will have rights to drill for oil in one of the most sensitive landscapes on Earth,\" Haaland told reporters. \"Climate change is the crisis of our lifetime, and we cannot ignore the disproportionate impacts being felt in the Arctic.\" The administration will also ban new leasing on more than 10 million acres in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, the largest undisturbed public land in the United States. Forty-year fight In 1980, Congress opened 1.5 million acres inside the refuge to oil and gas development. In 2017, Congress passed a tax reform bill authorizing the Interior Department to hold two lease sales by the end of 2024. The state's own economic development arm -- the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority (AIDEA) - bought 10-year leases covering more than 174,000 hectares (430,000 acres) of land. The land in question is estimated to hold more than 7 million barrels of oil and 198 billion cubic meters (7 billion cubic feet) of natural gas. In June 2021, the Biden administration put a hold on all drilling, pending an environmental review. AIDEA sued Biden and several other administration officials. \"The lawsuit is in direct response to unlawful actions to obstruct and delay the development of valid oil and gas leases in the non-wilderness Coastal Plain (Section 1002 Area) of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR),\" AIDEA said in a [press release](https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AIDEA-v-Biden.pdf) at the time. Last month, a federal judge dismissed the suit. Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy was quick to react to Haaland's announcement this week. \"The leases AIDEA hold in ANWR were legally issued in a sale mandated by Congress. It's clear that President [Joe] Biden needs a refresher on the Constitution's separation of powers doctrine. Federal agencies don't get to rewrite laws, and that is exactly what the Department of the Interior is trying to do here,\" he said. AIDAI said it will continue to \"aggressively defend\" its lease rights.

His choice is John Wesley \"Wes\" Nofire, a retired boxer, former member of the Cherokee Nation tribal council and harsh critic of principal chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. In a statement released Tuesday, Stitt's office described Nofire as \"outspoken about the challenges the Supreme Court's McGirt decision has created when it comes to administering justice fairly for every Oklahoman, native and non-native alike.\" In McGirt v. Oklahoma, U.S. Supreme Court justices reviewed the case of a Native American accused of the rape of a 4-year-old Native child on the Muscogee (Creek) Nation. An Oklahoma court sentenced him to two 500-year sentences and life without parole. More than 20 years later, his lawyers appealed, arguing that because Congress had never formally disestablished the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, the crime took place on tribal land. They cited the Major Crimes Act, an 1885 law that says when serious crimes are committed by or against a tribal member on tribal or reservation land, only the federal government, not the state, has the right to prosecute. The Supreme Court agreed. Though the ruling applies only to criminal jurisdiction, many in Oklahoma worry it could expand to other areas of law enforcement and beyond into environmental and energy arenas. Hoskin took to [Facebook ](https://www.facebook.com/chiefhoskin)to condemn Nofire, whose political views are said to align with Stitt's. \"It's difficult to overstate the active threat that Governor Stitt's new Native American Liaison, Wes Nofire, poses to tribal sovereignty,\" he wrote. \"He is on the record opposing tribal sovereignty and peddles dangerous and unhinged conspiracy theories.\" In an interview with Oklahoma's [KOKO-TV](https://www.koco.com/article/oklahoma-governor-stitt-tribes-appointee-relations-backlash/45026469), Nofire sent a message to Hoskin and other critics: \"Give me a little bit more time and allow me to be that olive branch. It grows. That's one thing that they do is when we reach out the hand of opportunity to reach back and let's work on these things, and I think we have a lot of opportunity there,\" Nofire said. Native American News Roundup Aug. 27-Sept. 2, 2023 Here are some Native American-related news stories that made headlines this week: New count of Indian Boarding Schools: 523 and likely growing The National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition (NABS) this week released an interactive digital map identifying 523 Indian boarding schools across the United States. That's 115 more than were identified in the [Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative Investigative Report of May 2022](https://www.bia.gov/sites/default/files/dup/inline-files/bsi_investigative_report_may_2022_508.pdf) that counted Indian boarding schools operated, funded, or supported by the U.S. government. The [new map](https://boardingschoolhealing.org/interactive-digital-map-of-indian-boarding-schools/) includes both federally operated boarding schools and institutions run by various religious entities. It also identifies known residential schools in Canada. The project has been three years in the works, and the group's Deputy CEO Samuel Torres (Mexica/Nahua) expects more schools will come to light. \"I believe this tool is going to greatly help our relatives who are seeking answers and who are on their own healing journeys,\" he said in a statement. \"Every Indigenous person in this country has been impacted by the deliberate attempt to destroy Native families and cultures through boarding schools. For us to visually see the scope of what was done to our communities and Nations at this scale is overwhelming, but this work is necessary to uncover the truth about this dark chapter in American history.\" [Native News Online](https://nativenewsonline.net/currents/native-american-boarding-school-healing-coalition-launches-interactive-map-of-united-states-523-american-indian-boarding-schools) reports that NABS is hoping to launch a database in November containing nearly 50,000 records collected from boarding and residential schools. Read [more](https://boardingschoolhealing.org/list/): University professor and accused 'pretendian' resigns Andrea Smith, once a well-regarded scholar of Native American studies, has agreed to resign from the University of California at Riverside after more than a decade of [accusations](https://www.thedailybeast.com/meet-the-native-american-rachel-dolezal) that she falsely claimed Cherokee identity. VOA obtained a copy of the separation agreement signed by Smith in January 2023 and by university chancellor Kim Wilcox in December 2022. It states that Smith will teach through the summer of 2024 and will then retire as a professor emeritus with the following stipulation: \"Professor Smith agrees that her status as a professor emeritus will not be listed on the university directory information websites.\" In addition, the university will pay her related legal fees up to $5,000. As VOA has [reported previously](https://www.voanews.com/a/native-first-nations-scholars-fake-indians-prevalent-in-higher-education-/6511681.html), Native American scholars say 'race shifting' is prevalent in universities across North America. In a 2022 interview with VOA, Kim TallBear, (Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate) a professor at the University of Alberta, explained why the practice is harmful: \"Non-Indigenous people with non-Indigenous community standpoints who pose as Indigenous and who rise through the professional ranks falsely represent our voices,\" TallBear said. \"They theorize Indigenous peoplehood, sovereignty and anti-colonialism. They become thought leaders, institutional decision-makers and policy advisers to governmental leaders with regulatory and economic power over our peoples and lands.\" Read [more](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-08-28/uc-riverside-professor-andrea-smith-accused-of-faking-native-american-heritage-resign): Native American Church to Washington: Protect our Peyote The Native American Church of North America (NACNA) will next month hold a second \"boots on the ground\" effort in Washington, calling on federal agencies and lawmakers to help protect peyote from the effects of climate change, corporate agriculture and so-called \"drug tourism.\" \"We will remind federal government agencies that laws established by them in 1978 and 1994\" allow Native American Church member to \"exercise our rights,\" church president Jon Brady posted to members on Peyote is a small, button-shaped cactus that contains psychoactive alkaloids and grows only in southern Texas and parts of northern Mexico.

The new Cherokee Film company will continue sharing the tribe's stories through OsiyoTV and is planning new projects to tell Cherokee stories and boost the revitalization of the Cherokee language. \"Cherokee Nation has quickly become a leading hub for Indigenous storytellers in television and film,\" Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. said in a statement. \"As we increase infrastructure, explore incentives, connect resources and remove barriers, Cherokee Nation and its businesses are helping grow and amplify television and film production in Oklahoma while making it possible for our citizens to be a part of it.\" Read [more](https://tribalbusinessnews.com/sections/economic-development/14452-cherokee-nation-launches-cherokee-film-to-become-film-and-media-production-hub): You can watch Cherokee Film's documentary series Osiyo: Voices of the People, [here](https://osiyo.tv/watch-now/): Pacific Northwest tribes welcome Polynesian navigators Hkle'a, a traditional Polynesian deep-sea canoe, is on a four-year voyage around the Pacific Ocean to raise awareness about climate change. The canoe sailed into Elliott Bay in Seattle, Washington, early Wednesday morning, escorted by traditional Suquamish canoes with Muckleshoot and Hawaiian canoes there to greet them. VOA correspondent Natasha Mozgovaya was there and filed this report: Tribal Courts Across US Expanding Holistic Alternatives to Criminal Justice System Inside a jail cell at Laguna Pueblo in New Mexico, Albertyn Pino's only plan was to finish the six-month sentence for public intoxication, along with other charges, and to return to her abusive boyfriend. That's when she was offered a lifeline: An invitation to the tribe's Healing to Wellness Court. She would be released early if she agreed to attend alcohol treatment and counseling sessions, secure a bed at a shelter, get a job, undergo drug testing and regularly check in with a judge. Pino, now 53, ultimately completed the requirements and, after about a year and a half, the charges were dropped. She looks back at that time, 15 years ago, and is grateful that people envisioned a better future for her when she struggled to see one for herself. \"It helped me start learning more about myself, about what made me tick, because I didn't know who I was,\" said Pino, who is now a case manager and certified peer support worker. \"I didn't know what to do.\" The concept of treating people in the criminal justice system holistically is not new in Indian Country, but there are new programs coming on board as well as expanded approaches. About one-third of the roughly 320 tribal court systems across the country have aspects of this healing and wellness approach, according to the National American Indian Court Judges Association. Combining legal advocacy and support Some tribes are incorporating these aspects into more specialized juvenile and family courts, said Kristina Pacheco, Tribal Healing to Wellness Court specialist for the California-based Tribal Law and Policy Institute. The court judges association is also working on pilot projects for holistic defense \u2014 which combine legal advocacy and support \u2014 with tribes in Alaska, Nevada and Oklahoma, modeled after a successful initiative at the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes in Montana. \"The thought and the concept will be different from tribe to tribe,\" said Pacheco. \"But ultimately, we all want our tribal people ... to not hurt, not suffer.\" People in the program typically are facing nonviolent misdemeanors, such as a DUI, public intoxication or burglary, she said. Some courts, like in the case of Pino, drop the charges once participants complete the program. A program at the Port Gamble S'Klallam Tribe in Washington state applies restorative principles and assigns wellness coaches to serve Native Americans and non-Natives in the local county jail, a report released earlier this year by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation outlined. The Muscogee (Creek) Nation in Oklahoma has a reintegration program that includes financial support and housing services, as well as cultural programming, career development and legal counsel. In Alaska, the Kenaitze Indian Tribe's wellness court helps adults in tribal and state court who are battling substance abuse and incorporates elements of their tribe's culture. \"There's a lot of shame and guilt when you're arrested,\" said Mary Rodriguez, staff attorney for the court judges association. \"You don't reach out to those resources, you feel that you aren't entitled to those resources, that those are for somebody who isn't in trouble with the law.\" 'You are better than the worst thing you've done' \"The idea of holistic defense is opening that up and reclaiming you are our community member, we understand there are issues,\" Rodriguez said. \"You are better than the worst thing you've done.\" The MacArthur Foundation report outlined a series of inequities, including a complicated jurisdictional maze in Indian Country that can result in multiple courts charging Native Americans for the same offense. The report also listed historical trauma and a lack of access to free, legal counsel within tribes as factors that contribute to disproportionate representation of Native Americans in federal and state prisons. Advocates of tribal healing to wellness initiatives see the approaches as a way to shift the narrative of someone's life and address the underlying causes of criminal activity. There isn't clear data that shows how holistic alternatives to harsh penalization have influenced incarceration rates. Narrative outcomes might be a better measure of success, including regaining custody of one's children and maintaining a driver's license, said Johanna Farmer, an enrolled citizen of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe in South Dakota and a program attorney for the court judges association. Some tribes have incorporated specific cultural and community elements into healing, such as requiring participants to interview their own family members to establish a sense of rootedness and belonging. \"You have the narratives, the stories, the qualitative data showing that healing to wellness court, the holistic defense practices are more in line with a lot of traditional tribal community practices,\" Farmer said. \"And when your justice systems align with your traditional values or the values you have in your community, the more likely you're going to see better results.\" While not all of these tribal healing to wellness programs have received federal funding, some have. Between 2020 and 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice distributed more than a dozen awards that totaled about $9.4 million for tribal healing to wellness courts. This year, the Quapaw Nation in Oklahoma started working on a holistic defense program after seeing a sharp increase in cases following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that said a large area of eastern Oklahoma remains a Native American reservation. So far this year, about 70 cases have been filed, up from nearly a dozen in all of 2020, said Corissa Millard, tribal court administrator. \"When we look at holistic approaches, we think, 'What's going to better help the community in long term?'\" she said. \"Is sending someone away for a three-year punishment going to be it? Will they reoffend once they get out? Or do you want to try to fix the problem before it escalates?\" For Pino, the journey through Laguna Pueblo's wellness court wasn't smooth. She struggled through relapses and a brief stint on the run before she found a job and an apartment to live in with her son nearby in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Her daughters live close by. She largely credits the wellness court staff for her ability to turnaround her life, she said. \"They were the ones that stood by me, regardless of what I was choosing to do; that was the part that brought me a lot of hope,\" she said. \"And now where I'm at, just to see them happy, it gets emotional, because they never let go. They never gave up on me.\" Native American News Roundup Aug. 13-19, 2023 Here are some of the Native American-related stories that made headlines this week: Native Hawaiians missing, dead or displaced by Maui wildfires Native Hawaiians - the Knaka Maoli - are struggling to comprehend the devastation caused by wildfires in Maui, last week.

An estimated 17,000 tribal families live without electricity, most of them in the Southwest and Alaska. The Tribal Electrification Program will provide money and expertise to help tribes electrify homes using environmentally friendly energy sources. It will also help homes that already have electricity switch to cleaner energy options and provide support for home repairs and changes needed to make this happen. The new funding announcement is part of an overall $150 million investment from the Inflation Reduction Act to support the electrification of homes in tribal communities. \"Climate change is the crisis of our lifetimes and has left far too many communities managing for worsening water challenges, extreme heat, devastating wildfires and unprecedented storms. Every action we take now to lessen the impacts for future generations is critical,\" Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said. \"Through President [Joe] Biden's Investing in America agenda, we're launching a new program to electrify Indian Country to provide reliable, resilient energy that Tribes can rely on, and advance our work to tackle the climate crisis and build a clean energy future.\" Read [more](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/president-bidens-investing-america-agenda-funds-launch-new-tribal-electrification): Interior Department to fund water systems in drought-ridden Upper Colorado River Basin In a related story, the Department of the Interior this week also announced it will make available $50 million over the next five years to improve key water supply systems and drought-related data collection across the Upper Colorado River Basin. \"The Biden-Harris administration is committed to bringing every tool and every resource to bear to as we work with states, Tribes and communities throughout the West to find long-term solutions in the face of climate change and the sustained drought it is creating,\" Deputy Secretary Tommy Beaudreau said. \"As we look toward the next decade of Colorado River guidelines and strategies, we are simultaneously making smart investments now that will make our path forward stronger and more sustainable.\" Read [more](https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-50-million-enhance-key-water-infrastructure): Celebrated Menominee activist Ada Deer dies Ada Deer, the first woman to lead the Interior Department's Bureau of Indian Affairs, died on Tuesday at the age of 88. A well-known champion for Native American rights and sovereignty, Deer grew up on the Menominee Indian Reservation in Keshena, Wisconsin. After earning her bachelor's and master's degrees, she worked as a social worker in New York and Wisconsin. In 1954, during the so-called \"Termination Era,\" Congress withdrew its recognition of the Menominee tribe, which meant their lands were now under state control and up for development. It also meant the tribe lost all federal benefits, such as health care and education, and was plunged into poverty. In the early 1970s, Deer and other Menominee supporters launched a grassroots movement \u2014 Determination of Rights and Unity of Menominee Shareholders, or DRUMS \u2014 in protest, and took their case to Washington. \"You don't have to collapse just because there's a federal law in your way. Change it,\" she told The Washington Post in 1973. In late 1973, President Richard Nixon signed the Menominee Restoration Act, reinstating the tribe's protected status and benefits. President Bill Clinton in 1973 appointed her assistant secretary for Indian Affairs at the Interior Department, overseeing the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

The blocked roads were built on tribal land in the 1960s and are the only route in and out for non-Natives living on the reservation. Land agreements allowing them to use the roads expired in 2013, and negotiations to extend them have so far failed. The Lac du Flambeau Tribal Council says it is owed $20 million for trespassing on its land since the easements expired. A group of non-tribal residents in [February](https://dockets.justia.com/docket/wisconsin/wiwdc/3:2023cv00135/50517) filed suit against the 12-member tribal council. The court held oral arguments June 7, 2023, and on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge William Conley dismissed the lawsuit altogether, acknowledging tribal sovereign rights over the roads, a matter over which federal courts lack jurisdiction.

They voted 89 to 55 in favor of the change during their annual conference, which was hosted in Winnipeg last week. Francine Compton, IJA associate director, said the move was made to match international language and to ensure all First Nations, Metis, Native American and Inuit journalists are included and supported. \"It means a whole lot to me, that I can now have this organization with a name where people in my own community can look at it and say, 'That's for me,'\" said Compton, who is Anishinaabe from the Sandy Bay Ojibway First Nation, 131 kilometers northwest of Winnipeg. The organization also updated the logo from NAJA with a feather to a stylized \"IJA,\" above.

Deer passed away Tuesday evening from natural causes, her godson Ben Wikler, chair of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, confirmed on Wednesday. She had entered hospice care last month. Trailblazer, advocate Born August 7, 1935, on the Menominee reservation in Keshena, Wisconsin, Deer is remembered as a trailblazer and fierce advocate for tribal sovereignty. She played a key role in reversing Termination Era policies of the 1950s that took away the Menominee people's federal tribal recognition. \"Ada was one of those extraordinary people who would see something that needed to change in the world and then make it her job and everyone else's job to see to it that it got changed,\" Wikler said. \"She took America from the Termination Era to an unprecedented level of tribal sovereignty.\" Deer was the first member of the Menominee Tribe to graduate from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and went on to become the first Native American to obtain a master's in social work from Columbia University, according to both schools' websites. In the early 1970s, Deer organized grassroots political movements that fought against policies that had rolled back Native American rights. The Menominee Tribe was placed under the control of a corporation in 1961, but Deer's efforts led President Richard Nixon in 1973 to restore the tribe's rights and repeal termination policies. Soon after, Deer was elected head of the Menominee Restoration Committee and began working as a lecturer in American Indian studies and social work at the University of Wisconsin. She unsuccessfully ran twice for Wisconsin's secretary of state and in 1992 narrowly lost a bid to become the first Native American woman elected to U.S. Congress. President Bill Clinton appointed Deer in 1993 as head of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, where she served for four years and helped strengthen federal protections and rights for hundreds of tribes. She remained active in academia and Democratic politics in the years before her death and was inducted into the National Native American Hall of Fame in 2019. Earlier this month, Governor Tony Evers proclaimed August 7, Deer's 88th birthday, as Ada Deer Day in Wisconsin. \"Ada was one-of-a-kind,\" Evers posted Wednesday on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. \"We will remember her as a trailblazer, a changemaker, "}
