However, the question is whether they work and are safe? Detox diets and cleansing claim to stimulate the liver and kidneys to eliminate harmful toxins. However, there is a lack of sufficient scientific evidence to support these claims. - Moreover, these popular programs claim that providing healthy nutrients and avoiding inflammatory foods, such as [sugar](https://www.medicinenet.com/sugar_addiction_pictures_slideshow/article.htm), [alcohol](https://www.medicinenet.com/alcohol_metabolism/article.htm), and processed ingredients, will reduce inflammation, support [digestion](https://www.medicinenet.com/the_digestion_process_organs_and_functions/article.htm), and aid circulation. - Yet, the body is naturally designed to detoxify itself (a built-in process); the liver, kidneys, and colon detoxify nearly all the harmful compounds (including heavy metals such as lead, mercury, [arsenic](https://www.medicinenet.com/arsenic_poisoning/article.htm), and cadmium) that get accumulated over time in different tissues. These get excreted through the urine, feces, sweat, and expired air. Therefore, the actual \"detoxing\" or \"toxin-eliminating\" claims of detox diets are not backed up or supported by confirmatory human trials or scientific evidence. - A team of experts has concluded that the results of a study conducted in 2015 do not support the use of detox diets for [weight loss](https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/article.htm)or removing toxins. - Another group found that juicing and trending detox diets are probably just a short-term fix. - There could be [weight loss](https://www.medicinenet.com/lose_weight_without_dieting_pictures_slideshow/article.htm)because of the consumption of fewer calories, but detox diets tend to lead to [weight gain](https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_gain/symptoms.htm)once a normal [diet](https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_plans_and_programs/article.htm)is resumed. What is a detox diet or cleanse? A detox [diet](https://www.medicinenet.com/diet_and_nutrition_quiz/quiz.htm) typically involves a period of fasting followed by a strict diet of raw vegetables, fruit and fruit juices, and water along with herbs and other [supplements](https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_minerals_and_nutritional_supplements/article.htm) and colon cleansing (enemas). This aims to improve digestion by systematically removing toxins that have built up in the blood, liver, or kidneys so that a person feels more revitalized and healthier. Detox diets and cleanses are extremely popular and considered to be the best way to jumpstart [weight loss](https://www.medicinenet.com/weight_loss/symptoms.htm), get back on a healthy diet plan, and reset metabolism. Detoxification programs vary from complete starvation to simpler food modifications and may differ in duration as well. Commonly used detox diets encourage at least one of the following: - Fasting for a minimum of one to three days - In addition to water, drinking fresh fruit and vegetable juices, lemon juice, and [green tea](https://www.medicinenet.com/green_tea_camellia_sinensis-oral/article.htm) - Eliminating foods that are high in heavy metals, contaminants, and allergens - Using [supplements](https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_supplements_quiz/quiz.htm)and herbs - Using laxatives or enemas - Regular [exercise](https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise/article.htm) - Eliminating alcohol, cigarettes, coffee, and refined [sugar](https://www.medicinenet.com/sugar_quiz/quiz.htm) What does detox diet and cleanses involve?

Besides water, there may be specific herbs, teas, supplements, and enemas involved in the cleansing or detox diet. Depending on the detox diet followed, some variations are there in the allowed and forbidden food list. The most common ones that are eliminated in a detox diet and cleanses include: - Meat - Eggs - Poultry - Nuts - Dairy - Gluten - Grains - Legumes - Soy Some programs even eliminate solid foods and only encourage drinking juices and broth, whereas some involve complete fasting. Other programs allow the consumption of healthy vegetables and fresh fruits that provide all of the [vitamins](https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_calcium_supplements/article.htm), [minerals](https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_minerals_and_nutritional_supplements/article.htm), and phytonutrients. Green tea is usually encouraged because there is evidence that it increases metabolic rate, aids metabolism, and reduces oxidative damage in the body. Some detox plans recommend [dietary supplements](https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamins_and_calcium_supplements/article.htm), herbs, pills, powders, laxatives, enemas, and other forms of colon cleansing.
