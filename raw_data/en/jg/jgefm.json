In August of 2014, Dr. Thompson stated, \"I regret that my coauthors and I omitted statistically significant information in our 2004 article published in the Journal of Pediatrics.\" Folks, we have a whistleblower at the CDC who has admitted, under oath, that the CDC falsified data in order to deny a link between vaccinations and autism. Furthermore, Dr. Thompson has stated that senior CDC researchers tried to destroy all documents related to this cover-up. Dr. Thompson has saved these documents, and still nothing has happened. Nada. Zip. Zero. There have been no Congressional hearings. The mainstream media has refused to talk about it. For the Big Pharma Vaccine Cartel, it is business as usual. Pregnant women, children, and others are still told that vaccines are safe even when they contain toxic substances such as mercury, aluminum, and formaldehyde. I would like someone to show me a single study that proves it is safe to inject these toxic substances into any living being\u2014especially a pregnant women or a child. The reason I won't see a study is that there are none. The 2004 study mentioned above found no link between the MMR vaccine and autism because they omitted crucial data. When the data was included, the study found a 240% increase in autism among African American children and a 69% increase in all children who were vaccinated with the MMR vaccine before 36 months of age.

Is there any good news? There is one bit of positive news to speak of: One courageous Congressman has spoken in front of Congress twice about this issue. His name is Bill Posey. I have attached a link to his October 21, 2015 speech here. Dr. Posey is demanding his colleagues call hearings on this matter... Folks, this will only happen if you contact your representative and tell them that we are demanding a Congressional hearing on the CDC whistleblower. It is vitally important for all of us to speak up. If the information from Dr. Thompson is proven to be true, this could rival the injustice of the Tuskegee disaster. IT IS TIME TO SPEAK UP! CALL YOUR CONGRESSPERSON TODAY AND CONTINUE CALLING EACH DAY TO TELL THEM YOU WANT A CONGRESSIONAL HEARING ON THIS MATTER.
