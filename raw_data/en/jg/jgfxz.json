For the majority of animals, acupuncture is virtually pain-free. By activating the central nervous system, acupuncture releases the body's natural painkillers (such as endorphins), hormones (such as cortisol) and neurotransmitters (such as serotonin), thereby affecting all systems of the body. The Chinese refer to this as restoring the balance of the vital energy, or Chi. Numerous scientific papers have verified that acupuncture not only relieves pain, but stimulates circulation and the immune system, decreases inflammation, relieves muscle spasms, and induces a feeling of well-being, all with minimal side effects. What to expect At the initial visit with a CRCG expert certified veterinary acupuncturist, the medical history is reviewed and an examination is completed to determine the suitability of your dog or cat for acupuncture therapy. The prognosis and likely number of follow-up visits is discussed. Treatment in the clinic may involve dry needle acupuncture, moxibustion, electro-acupuncture, aqua-puncture, massage, range of motion and stretching. Instruction will be given on at-home therapies such as acupressure, hot or cold packs, massage and stretching. The goal of therapy is always to improve the patient's quality of life by providing the best available veterinary acupuncture and wellness services in a comfortable, caring atmosphere. "}
