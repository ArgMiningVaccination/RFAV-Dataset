The National Acupuncture Detoxification Association (NADA) developed a 5-point auricular (ear) acupuncture protocol specifically for the treatment of addiction, which is used by more than 2,000 drug and alcohol programs today. NADA is a not-for-profit training and advocacy organization, promoting community wellness through the use of a standardized auricular acupuncture protocol for behavioral health, addiction, mental health, and disaster & emotional trauma ( [https://acudetox.com](https://acudetox.com)). Most often, we use the NADA protocol to help people quit smoking. An ear acupuncture or NADA treatment involves the gentle placement of 5 small disposable needles into specific site in each ear. These sites correspond to different parts of the body. The 5 designated acupuncture points that are used include: Lung, Kidney, Liver, Shen Men, and Sympathetic. The organ points, Lung, Kidney, and Liver, promote organ recovery and detoxification. Ear point Shen Men translates to \"Spirit Gate\" and is a powerful point to calm the mind and ease anxiety. The Sympathetic point relates to the autonomic nervous system and has a strong pain relieving and relaxing effect. Ear Acupuncture will help: alleviate withdrawal symptoms reduce cravings promote organ recovery ease anxiety + stress promote restorate sleep enhance will-power + motivation improve sense of well-being reduce a need for pharmaceuticals The NADA treatment was designed to be a non-verbal approach to healing used in clinical group settings. At our clinic, your session will be private and there will be a brief intake at the start of your session. You will relax with the needles in for 30-45 minutes, allowing the treatment to take effect. Treatments are most impactful when received multiple times per week. We offer NADA treatment packages to keep your visits affordable. Length of treatments and success varies for each individual. While some patients respond quickly to treatments, others may require a series of ongoing treatments. We will always strive to create an environment and treatment plan that is most supportive to you. Acupuncture provides a foundation for recovery and rehabilitation, in addition to empowering you to create change. It is clinically effective, cost-efficient, and drug-free. Combining your acupuncture treatments with counseling, education, medical support and self-help groups enhances opportunities for success. TO BEST ACHIEVE YOUR STOP-SMOKING GOALS, CONSIDER THESE TIPS: ~ Make a list of reasons to quit. Keep reminding yourself why you gave up the habit. ~ Surround yourself with supportive, like-minded people and reach out when you need encouragement. ~ Set boundaries. If possible, stay away from smokers in the first few weeks you are trying to quit. ~ Have an affirmation. This is a positive statement repeated often to create desired changes in your life. For example: \"I successfully quit smoking. I am now healthier, happier and relaxed.\" ~ Strategize. Plan what you will do during a craving, which can last 5 minutes. Chew licorice root sticks or gum; repeat your affirmation; breathe deeply; exercise; sing a song; dance; call your support person. ~ Out with the old! Throw away your ash trays, lighters, matches, and cigarettes. Remove indoor pollutants from your home. Fill your house with plants, which act as natural air filters. ~ Get moving. A quick walk after meals will help regulate blood sugar levels, boost your energy, decrease stress,, and increase metabolism. ~ Eat your fruits and veggies. They are high in fiber, nutrients, and antioxidants, and an important feature of a detox diet. Chlorophyl-rich (green) foods cleanse the lungs and blood. ~ Drink more water. Hydrate your body, soothe dryness, and flush out the toxins that have built up in your cells. ~ Practice deep breathing. Calm your nerves and strengthen your lungs. BONUS: Try pine essential oil in a diffuser or use a drop on your chest. Pine strengthens the lungs, improves respiratory function, and promotes will-power. ~ Create a new routine, change your current schedule, so there is no time for addiction.
