The intent o f this document is to ensure that the levels of evidence for SE are rigorous enough to protect public health and maintain consumer confidence, while providing a clearly defined pathway to bring into the market discipline -specific complementary medicines. It should be read together with the current versions of the following documents , including those referred to therein: 6.18 Complementary Medicines - Screening Template for new applications for registration of a Complementary Medicine 7.02 Complementary Medi cines - Roadmap and Transitional Process 7.03 Complementary Medicines - Use of the ZA CTD format in the preparation of a registration application 7.04 Complementary Medicines - Health Supplements: Safety and Efficacy 7.05 Complementary Medicines - Quality 7.06 Complementary Medicines - Guidance on Specified Substances Other SAHPRA guidelines may be referred to where appropriate. A copied of the referenced guideline should also be supplied. ii) Scope and Overview This SE Guideline applies to complement ary medicines (Category D) of the discipline specific sub -category for human use. In addition, the requirements and restrictions outlined in this document do not apply to compounded medicines in terms of Section 14(4) of the Act. In general, Complementary Medicines (CMs) are used and sold by many people in the RSA. These guidelines accompany the regulations dealing with the registration and post -marketing control of these medicines. The guidelines give some direction with regard to the requ ired information for discipline -specific CMs but should not in themselves be regarded as final. Where an applicant wishes to use and submit information not found in these guidelines, they may do so, but they would have to make thoroughly justified submiss ions on scientific, technical or traditional grounds. The CMs that will be the subject to these Guidelines are those associated with those disciplines as determined by the Authority herein . Currently , six major disciplines have been therewith , Chinese Medicine, Unani Medicine, and Western Herbal Medicine . In addition, a seventh category - Combination Products - is recognised and dealt with below. The classification of \"Other Herbal\" may also be appropriated where any herbal substance of origin from a traditional discipline not listed above. The disciplines of CMs are defined in this guideline and evidence required to substantiate the claims made for products falling under any of the disciplines , is divided into high risk or low risk categories. For all CMs, quality and safety are non -negotiable, whereas, depending upon the discipline, proof of abso lute efficacy may prove challenging, for a variety of reasons, and therefore concessions have been made in this area for tradition (discipline) based CMs that have a long history of use. Registration of Medicines: CMs DS Safety & Efficacy June 2020 7.01_CMs_SE_DS_Jun20_v3_1 Page 5 of 47 Back to ToC All manufacturers of CMs will be subject to compliance with Good Manu facturing Practice (GMP ) most appropriate to the context and nature of the product . In the process of complying with these practices , the quality of the medicines is promoted and aimed at rendering them to be of acceptable quality, safety and efficacy. The approach of these guidelines is to enable the applicant to present, to the SAHPRA , an application free of errors and easy to review. Each discipline will have its own set of requirements governed by its own references and pharmacopoeia e which are all su bject to and compliant with the current science and knowledge of that particular discipline. Other relevant Guidelines of the SAHPRA should be consulted where necessary. Where guidelines are referred to, the latest (current) version should be used. Discipline -specific c omplementary medicines will be subject to the Scheduling of Medicines Guideline . CMs are not scheduled solely on the basis of toxicity. Although toxicity is one of the factors considered, the decision to include a substance in a particular Schedule also takes into account many other criteria such as the purpose of use, potential for misuse, abuse, safety in use, the need for specialised (professional) know ledge in its prescription and the need for the substance. Before submitting an application for registration of a complementary medicine, it is first necessary to establish that the product contains substances that are, in fact confirmed to relate to the re levant discipline and/or health supplements . ANNEXURE A is included to help decide what would be regarded as a Category D substance , while ANNEXURES B and C describe the process of determination of relevant disciplines and origin of substances. 1.1 Definitions i) As per the General Regulations made in terms of the Medicines and Related Substances Act, 1965 (Act 101 of 1965): \"complementary medicine\" means any substance or mixture of substances that - (a) originates from plants, fungi, algae, seaweeds, lichens, minerals, animals or other substance as determined by the Authority; (b) is used or purporting to be suitable for use or manufactured or sold for use- (i) in maintaining, complementing or assisting the physical or mental state; or (ii) to diagnose, treat, mitigate, modify, alleviate or prevent disease or illness or the symptoms or signs thereof or abnormal physical or mental state of a human being or animal; and (c) is used - (i) as a health supplement; or (ii) in accordance with those disciplines as determined by the Authority; ii) As per the General Regulations made in terms of the Medicines and Related Substances Act, 1965 (Act 101 of 1965): \"health supplement\" means any substance, extract or mixture of substances as determined by the Authority, sold in dosage forms used or purported for use in restoring, correcting or modifying any physical or mental state by - (a) complementing health; (b) supplementing the diet; or (c) a nutritional effect, and excludes injectable preparations, medicines or substances listed as Schedule 1 or higher in the Act; Registration of Medicines: CMs DS Safety & Efficacy June 2020 7.01_CMs_SE_DS_Jun20_v3_1 Page 6 of 47 Back to ToC iii) For the purposes of this guideline a combination product is (see also 1.6.2) : Combination product means a single product that contains: a) a mixture of s ubstances of different discipline -specific origin s or philosoph ies; b) a mixture of at le ast one substance of discipline -specific origin and one or more health supplements ; or c) a mixture of at least one substance of discipline -specific origin and one or more of its isolated constituents . 1.1.1 Active Ingredients Intended for Medicines Compounded in terms of Section 14(4) The provisions of registration do not apply to Active Ingredients / raw materials that are supplied to practitioners for the purposes of compounding in terms of section 14(4) of the Act . The exclusions relating to compounding apply where a practitioner prepares a medicine for an individual patient either following consultation with that particular patient, or to fill a prescription for that particular patient. This policy recogni ses the one -off nature of such medicines, the professional training and licensing of the practitioner to prepare a medicine for the specific needs of an individual patient. (This does not include otherwise available proprietary products or bona fide medicines for sale to the general public ) Manufacturers of substances for supply to individual practitioners for use in compounded medicines shall be duly licensed as a manufacturer or wholesaler and supply active ingredients / raw materials to registere d and duly licensed practitioners only, provided that supply of such substance shall only be made to practitioners who are holders of combined dispensing and compounding licen ces as contemplated by section 22C of the Act. 1.2 Compliance with Good Manufactu ring Practice (GMP), Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and Good Agricultural and Collection Practices (GACP) All manufacturers of complementary medicines shall comply with all relevant aspects of Good Manufacturing Practice as outlined in the latest version of the SAHPRA's \"GUIDE TO GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICE FOR MEDICINES IN SOUTH AFRICA\" and Good Laboratory Practice as well as the WHO Guidelines on Good Agricultural and Collection Pra ctices (GACP) for Medicinal Plants , if applicable . Any alternative standards must be specified, referenced and justified. 1.3 Format of submission Data provided in applications for registration of complementary medicines should be in the latest version of the Common Technical Document ( ZA-CTD) format as published by the SAHPRA . 1.4 Types of Substances and Preparations 1.4.1 Herbal substance/preparati on Herbal substance /preparation , in any discipline, means all or part of a plant, fungus, alga, seaweed or lichen, or other substance: a) that is obtained only by drying, crushing, distilling, freezing, fermentation, lyophilisation, extracting, expressing, co mminuting, mixing with an inert diluent substance or another herbal substance or mixing with water, ethanol, glycerol, oil or aqueous ethanol; or other permitted solvents; with or without the addition of heat; Registration of Medicines: CMs DS Safety & Efficacy June 2020 7.01_CMs_SE_DS_Jun20_v3_1 Page 7 of 47 Back to ToC b) that is not subjected to any other treatment o r process other than a treatment or process that is necessary for its presentation in a pharmaceutical dosage form; c) where part of a plant, fungus, seaweed or lichen refers to a structure such as rhizome, mycelium, fruiting body, or bark, wood, meristematic tissue, shoot, bud, thallus, resin, oleoresin, gum, natural exudate or secretion, gall, leaf, frond, flower (or its parts), inflorescence, pollen, fruit, seed, cone, spores or other whole pla nt part ; and d) that does not include: i. a pure chemical or isolated constituent unless the isolated herbal constituent is formulated with the herbal substance from which it arises and is demonstrated to have \"essentially the same\"1 action as the whole herbal substance ; or ii. a substance of mineral, animal or bacterial origin. 1.4.2 Traditional Chinese, Ayurvedic and Unani substances Traditional Chinese, Ayurvedic and Unani substances , in addition to herbal substances, may contain substances of animal or mineral origin. 1.4.3 Homeop athic substances /preparations Homeopathic substances / preparations may be a) of plant, fungal, animal, mineral or other origin prepared in accordance with homeop athic principles and may include starting substances a s well as allersodes, isodes, sarcodes, nosodes, allergens, and allopathic substances all used in potentised form at acceptable potencies for use as a homeop athic medicine; b) formulated for use based on homeop athic principles, which may include being capa ble of producing symptoms in a healthy person similar to those which it is administered to alleviate, or those principles related to classical, clinical or combination homeop athy; or c) prepared or purported to be prepared according to the practices of homeop athic pharmacy including starting substances using the methods described in a recognised pharmacopoeia which may include (i) serial dilution and succussion of a mother tincture in water, ethanol, aqueous ethanol or glycerol; or (ii) serial trituration in lactose , and may include electronic preparations, tissue salts, spagyric therapy, gemmotherapy and lithotherapy 1.4.4 Aromatherapy substances Aromatherapy substances are essential (volatile) oil s, hydrolat es (hydrosols) or other aromatic extracts of plant origin where, reference must be made to the part of the plant(s) or the whole plant and method used to extract the essential oils. Synthetic aromatic compounds for medicinal purposes should follow the Category A registration route. 1 Guidance on equivalence of herbal extracts in complementary medicines; https://www.tga.gov.au/publication/guidance -equivalence -herbal - extracts -complementary -medicines#not Registration of Medicines: CMs DS Safety & Efficacy June 2020 7.01_CMs_SE_DS_Jun20_v3_1 Page 8 of 47 Back to ToC 1.4.5 Anthroposophical, Gemmotherapeutic, Spagyric Substances and Flower Essences In most cases these medicinal products cannot be distinguished on the basis of th eir methods of production, as these are largely shared with other medicinal product groups such as homeopathic and western herbal medicinal products. In case of overlap, they will be qualified as either homeopathic or Western herbal medicines, or a combin ation based on their presentation in the product. Applicants are permitted to make use of the in addition to the specific discipline on any labelling, package insert, patient information leaflet of other product -related documentation . 1.5 The Naming of Substances and Ingredients used in Complemen tary Medicines The following naming conventions will be relevant for names of substance /ingredients used in Complementary Medicines in respect of any application for registration of such or on any product labelling thereof. Refer also to Guideline 7.05: Annex B - Naming and labelling conventions for active ingredients in complementary medicines. 1.5.1 Chemical Substance Name The approved name , i.e. International Non -Proprietary Name (INN) or chemical name of substances used must be stated. In the absence of such name being available , a chemical description or characterisation of the substance should be give n. The approved name (INN) or chemical name of mineral, metal or chemical substances or prepared mineral substances used in Homeopathic, Tradit ional Chinese, Ayurvedic or Unani Tibb medicines must be stated. 1.5.2 Biological Substance Name or Animal Substance Name In addition to the name of the organism, the part, preparation and /or biological descriptor may be required to name a biological or animal substance fully . 1.5.3 Herbal Name For purposes of the registration procedure , herbal names are stated in the Latin binomial format , which must include the genus, species, subspecies, variety, sub -variety, form, sub -form or chemotype and author where appropriate. Reference must be made to the internationally accepted name for the plant, fungus or alga by referring to the following databases where appropriate (in order of priority): a) The Plant List (Available at: http://www.theplantlist.org ); b) The Index Fungorum (Available at: http://www.indexfungorum.org ); c) The International Plant Names Index (Available at: http://www.ipni.org ); or d) other recognised major flora Examples of correct herbal names binomial name (as above ), the part and the preparation (including solvents and ratio if applicable) are used to name an herbal ingredient fully. Registration of Medicines: CMs DS Safety & Efficacy June 2020 7.01_CMs_SE_DS_Jun20_v3_1 Page 9 of 47 Back to ToC For purposes of the product label , a simple Latin binomial or pharmacopoeial names of herbal ingredients that are fully characterised in a monograph of an accepted pharmacopoeia may be used provided it is clear to the consumer exactly which herb (or part thereof) is being used . 1.5.4 Herbal Component Name (HCN) HCNs are names for classes of constituents that are found in herbal ingredients. The need for a HCN most often arises when a herbal extract is standardised to a particular class of constituents, or where particular classes of constituents are restricted (e.g. hydroxyanthracene derivatives). Where a herbal extract is stan dardised to a single constituent, the single constituent should have a chemical name. The HCN is not a stand -alone name and should be used only when expressing a herbal substance. 1.5.5 Common Names Common names , Materia Medica Names and/or Discipline -specific names (e.g. : Traditional Chinese Pin Yin, Traditional Sanskrit or Traditional Unani Tibb Names) may be used in addition to the approved names. The Pin Yin name of the plant may also be used in addition to the English names of the plan t parts in the case of T raditional Chinese medicines. 1.6 Multi -component Formula tions and Combination Products 1.6.1 Multi -component Formula tions For complementary medicines that contain multiple ingredients, the evaluation of quality, safety and efficacy also relies on the correct formulation of the product according to the principles of the discipline from which it arises. It is recognised that traditional medicine disciplines have their own innate systems for assuring quality, safety and effica cy. An applicant should demonstrate that their product has been formulated carefully and correctly in accordance with the principles of the discipline from which it arises and, if a product is not formulated according to traditional principles, then the a pplicant must provide a detailed rationale as to why the ingredients in the product are combined and address any potential concerns about potential incompatibility (physical, chemical, traditional) of any of the constituent parts. New combinations of activ e ingredients previously used separately or in different combinations, must be suitably justified according to the philosophy / principles of the associated discipline, including consideration of principles that relate to the additive, synergistic or modul ating effects and compatibility of the various ingredients of a formula and the associated dosage justifications that these principles may merit. Each active ingredient must contribute to the overall efficacy of the medicine. 1.6.2 Combination Products Refer to the definition of \"combination product\" as provided in 1.1. a) In the case of combination products of a mixture of substances of various discipline -specific origin or philosophy applicants will need to demonstrate an explic it, cogent rationale for use of all discipline -specific ingredients in the formula. b) In the case of combination products of a mixture of at least one substance of discipline -specific origin and one or more health supplements: detailed information must be provided t o explain the rationale behind the inclusion of each substance together with the discipline -specific substances, and Registration of Medicines: CMs DS Safety & Efficacy June 2020 7.01_CMs_SE_DS_Jun20_v3_1 Page 10 of 47 Back to ToC where any health supplements fall below minimum levels required for use of the associated health supplement claim, no claim related to its presence in the formula will be permitted. c) In the case of a mixture of at least one substance of discipline -specific origin and one or more of its isolated constituents: the isolated constituent must be formulated with the herbal substance from which it arises ; and the action of the isolate d constituent must be \"essentially the same\" (not significantly different) (See 1.4.1) as the action of the herbal substance. In any instance (a, b or c) the registration sub -category will be \"Combination Product\" and the discipline(s) it relates to. 1.7 Accepted References The following references (in addition to any further specified accepted references [ANNEXURE D] for each discipline ) should be consulted for purposes of motivating that the product or substances used originate from the discipline indicated [ZA-CTD Modules 1.5.1] .

References listed that justify the medicine in terms of efficacy or safety claims (including traditional use and clinical evidence) . 1.3.3 Labels 1.5 Specific requirements for different types of applications 1.5.1 Literature -based submissions A brief statement as to why the product meets the requirements for traditional use registration and addressing the evidence of long-standing use of the product, expanded in Module 2.5. Where a herbal monograph exists that is relevant to the proposed preparation, applicants should outline this fact in this section of the dossier and expand on it in Module 2.5. The circumstances of any form of Combination Product should be suitably motivated. A description as to the motivation of the selected risk level (LOW or HIGH) should also be provided. In order for a product to qualify to be registered as a CM in South Africa it must demonstrate origin from a recognised discipline. Provide references for the use of these substances in the specified discipline by providing references from the listed accepted sources. Traditional use within the discipline should be given, where possible for each of the following two aspects: a) origin /use of that herb within the discipline in general (as a demonstration of long -standing safe use); and b) use of the herb in the disci pline for the indications claimed for this product or the particular API (demonstrating accordance with its clinical use in the discipline). Where ( b) is not possible and rather relies on new or non - traditional evidence, this should be stated and the sour ce of indications stated, e.g. clinical data from RCT.

Module Heading Comments/Notes 2.1 CTD Table of Contents (ToC) Modules 2 to 5 Ensure that the volume numbers indicated in the Table of Contents (ToC) correlate with the volume numbers of the final submission copies. 2.2 Introduction Provide an introduction that would contextualise all presented information of the module , including the relevance, necessity and appropriateness of Modules 2.4 and 2.5. 2.4 Non-clinical Overview A bibliographic review of safety data together with a summary report, and where required, data necessary for assessing the safety of the medicinal product. The report on safety data should take into consideration the agreed format for the organisation of the non -clinical overview in the CTD. The list of relevant references for non -clinical data can be included at the end of module 2.4 Where a recognised monograph/reference standard has been established applicants should discuss this fact in the dossier taking into consideration that they do refer to the specific active ingredients and aspects related to the finished product. Furthermore, the applicant will need to demonstrate that the proposed product contains the CM substances which correspond to a CM substance listed in the monograph. A literature search should be provided to fill the gap between the compilation of any recognised reference source and the application, providing information about the research strategy. The relevance of the newer data and/or unpublished, specific data has to be discussed in relation of the known properties of the herbal substance(s) and the possible impact of such data on the existing assessment. If the extract solvent and/or concentration is/are different from those given in the recognised reference/monograph, comparability has to be demonstrated by using appropriate analytical data. The same applies, if non -published data, which should be used ( e.g. tests on mutagenicity) is referring to different extract solvent and/or concentration. For combination products the assessment should not only focus on the single CM substances, but also an assessment of the combination is necessary. If risks have been identified, the report must explain why a positive benefit/risk -balance for a traditional use is justified. Registration of Medicines: CMs DS Safety & Efficacy June 2020 7.01_CMs_SE_DS_Jun20_v3_1 Page 15 of 47 Back to ToC Module Heading Comments/Notes 2.5 Clinical overview A bibliographical evidence or expert evidence to the effect that the medicinal product in question, or its ingredients or a corresponding product, has a history of traditional medicinal use (as per the definition in the guideline) within the Republic of So uth Africa or within a country, the regulatory authority of which the SAHPRA aligns itself with. The evidence provided by traditional use should not be overstated and should be applicable to the level of indication provided. Sufficient reference and guidance as related to the claim and as per the guideline should be provided. Where reference is made to recognised: monographs or other reference standard: Sources may be quoted but copies of the relevant text extract must be provided; and Demonstration of how the product accords with such sources must be made. The plausibility of pharmacological effects or efficacy of the medicinal product as well as information on the safety of use should be addressed in this section. A summary of clinical evidence should also be included where required. For combination products the assessment should not only focus on the single CM substances, but also an assessment of the combination is necessary. A bibliographic review of safety data together with an expert report, and where required, data necessary for asse ssing the safety of the medicinal product. Evidence of widespread, long -standing use without significant safety problems emerging should form the basis of a typical safety report. Deficiencies in safety information should also be clearly addressed. The report should ideally consider the following aspects of safety: the nature of the patient population and the extent of patient exposure/world -wide marketing experience to date common and non -serious adverse events serious adverse events methods to prevent, mitigate or manage adverse events reactions due to overdose long-term safety if relevant data is available special patient populations , e.g. children and pregnant or lactating women relevant animal toxicology and product quality information Registration of Medicines: CMs DS Safety & Efficacy June 2020 7.01_CMs_SE_DS_Jun20_v3_1 Page 16 of 47 Back to ToC Module Heading Comments/Notes If risks have been identified, the report must explain why a positive benefit/risk -balance for a traditional use is justified. For example, if there are reports of serious adverse events, this must be balanced by sufficient evidence of appropriate benefit. In summary, five (5) pivotal pieces of information must be discussed in this section of the dossier a) traditional use b) therapeutic indication and associated clinical evidence where necessary c) strength/type of substance d) posology e) specific information on safe use and evidence of safety 2.3 Module 4 : Non-clinical study reports Module Heading Comments/Notes 4.1 Table of contents of Module 4 4.2 Study Reports If data are available or have been requested these should be provided and summarised in Module 2.6, for which the corresponding non -clinical overview would be included in Module 2.4 Any reports or studies referenced should be provided in full.

Not all sections may be relevant to all applications, but applicants are advised to consider the applicability of th ese comments to each application. Applications for the registration of complementary medicines must include appropriate data that demonstrate the safety of the product as provided for in these guidelines. Safety may be established by detailed reference to the published literature and/or t he submission of original study data. A guiding principle should be that, if the product has been traditionally used without demonstrated harm, a review of the relevant literature should be provided with original articles or references to the original art icles. If official monograph/review results exist, reference should be made to them. Toxicological studies, if available, should be part of the assessment. If a toxicological risk is known, relevant toxicity data must be submitted. The assessment of risk, whether independent of dose or related to dose, should be documented. The applicant must provide evidence (data) to support the product's efficacy for the proposed indication(s) and any claims that the applicant intends to make in the product labelling to determine whether the data supplied adequately support the requested indication(s)/claim(s) as provided for in these guidelines. Proof of efficacy, including the documentation required to support t he indicated claims, should depend on the nature and level of the indications. For the treatment of minor disorders, for nonspecific indications, or for limited prophylactic uses, less stringent requirements (e.g. observational studies) may be adequate to prove efficacy, especially when the extent of traditional use and the experience with a particular herbal medicine and supportive pharmacological data are taken into account. Where traditional use has not been established, appropriate pre -clinical and/or clinical evidence will be required, dependent on the risk level of the claim (See 4.1) . 3.1 Well-documented Ingredients Where an active ingredient is well described in standard sources it is possible to use these descriptions as the basis of the efficacy and safety information. The following are examples of the reference texts that are usually acceptable as sources of information on the safety, efficacy and dosage regimen of ingredients: Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference , Sweetman SC (ed), P harmaceutical Press, United Kingdom Handbook of Non -Prescription Drugs, American Society of Health System Pharmacists, United States; Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Gennaro AR (ed), Mack Publishing Company, United States; Handbook of Pharmaceutical E xcipients, Kibbe AH (ed), American Society of Health System Pharmacists, United States; Other sources should primarily include e vidence -based references, such as the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database . Where the NMCD is referenced, care should be tak en to consider the section from which information is taken (e.g. , not safe, insufficient evidence or sufficient evidence for efficacy). Information quoted from such references when done so without this context and further substantiation is not acceptable. Information from s ections such as \" People use this for: \" should be used with caution. Registration of Medicines: CMs DS Safety & Efficacy June 2020 7.01_CMs_SE_DS_Jun20_v3_1 Page 18 of 47 Back to ToC While this information may serve as limited substantiation of traditional use , it does not adequately substantiate claims of efficacy and safety . Note al so that anecdotal or limited clinical reports/mentions of efficacy alone (e.g. in Martindale, \"xxx has also been used in ...\") are not considered evidence of efficacy and safety. Indications and dosage must be the same as described in these sources . Any use outside the documented indications and/or dosages, or any new route of administration, will require evidence of efficacy and safety . Applications for products with well -documen ted ingredients should include details of the relevant texts (photocopies or scans of the relevant pages are preferred) with particular references to the accepted indications , dosage and routes of administration of the active ingredients. Refer to excipients that are Generally Regarded As S afe (GRAS) 3.2 Quality of Data Since the evidence to demonstrate efficacy and safety of products may be literature -based , it is important that a critical appraisal on the quality of the data is provided. Applications based on the literature or on clinical trials should include: an index of contents; non-clinical and clinical overview s referenced to the submission by page number; full copies (not abstracts) of all relevant reports and clinical trials. The non-clinical and clinical overviews should include a critical appraisal of the quality of the data generated from each trial and the relevance of the results to the efficacy and safety of the product. Where more than one indication is claimed, each ind ication should be separately justified in relation to the data included in the submission. Where more than one active ingredient is included in the product, the rationale for the inclusion of each active ingredient must be stated and justified. The inclus ion of each active ingredient and the intended use of the product as a whole should be justified in terms of each ingredient's and the product as a whole's efficacy and safety. For adverse events, the overview should provide , in humans, an assessment of ov erall incidence, seriousn ess, causality of effects, dose -response relationship, special population subgroups such as the elderly and patients with renal or hepatic impairment, and an indication of reversibility or otherwise. Where available an evidence -based approach using predetermined levels of evidence (e.g. systematic review and meta -analysis; randomised controlled trial; expert opinion) combined with a grading of the quality of the evidence should be developed. In compiling a literature -based submission it is not appropriate to simply collect and submit a few favourable published papers. The applicant must demonstrate that: the relevant peer-reviewed literature provided has been methodically investigated ; the range of sources selected fo r submission is justified , and issues and concerns raised in the literature in relation to the product or its ingredients have been addressed. 3.3 Benefits and Risks - Conclusion Registration of Medicines: CMs DS Safety & Efficacy June 2020 7.01_CMs_SE_DS_Jun20_v3_1 Page 19 of 47 Back to ToC The evaluation of high -risk level claims (i.e. the use of medicines for the treatment or prevention of a disease /disorder ) requires an assessment of the differential between the benefits of a medicine and the risks of its use. There is no simple measure for this: the acceptable level of risk varies with the nature of the benefit s, the risk from taking the medicine and the risk s of untreated (and undiagnosed) disease s. Generally, the more serious and life threatening the untreated disease and the greater the benefit, th e higher is the level of acceptable risk. The benefit -risk profile is also affected by the availability of accepted (proven) treatments, the risk profile of those accepted therapies, and the risks of foregoing treatment where such a medically acceptable op tion is available . A benefits risk profile should be determined for every high-risk complementary medicine (refer to Table 1). 3.4 Clinical Trials of Complementary Medicines Where clinical trials are reference d, proposed or used, t he relevant guidelines for clinical trials should be consulted and are available on the SAHPRA website or from the office of the CEO of SAHPRA . Registration of Medicines: CMs DS Safety & Efficacy June 2020 7.01_CMs_SE_DS_Jun20_v3_1 Page 20 of 47 Back to ToC 4 SAFETY REQUIREMENTS 4.1 Criteria for determining the safety of indications and health claims The indications and health claims will be classified into t wo risk levels, namely High and Low -risk indications or claims, as shown in Table 1. Table 1. Risk Level, type of claim and evidence required Risk Level Type of Claim Evidence required to support claim LOW RISK General health enhancement without any reference to specific diseases 1 Health maintenance, including nutritional support. Relief of minor symptoms (not related to a disease or disorder) 2 Clinical data to be evaluated 3 AND/OR: Two of the following four sources that demonstrates adequate support for the indications claimed: 1 Recognised Pharmacopoeia 4; 2 Recognised Monograph 4; 3 Three independent written histories of use in the classical or traditional medical literature . 5,6, or 4 Citations from other in vivo, in vitro studies, case reports or others. HIGH RISK Treats/cures/manages any disease/disorder. Prevention of any disease or disorder. Reduction of risk of a disease/disorder. Aids/assists in the management of a named disease/disorder or sign/symptom of a named disease/disorder. Relief of symptoms of a named disease or disorder 2 Treatment of proven vitamin or mineral deficiency diseases. Clinical data to be evaluated 3. AND Two of the following four sources that demonstrates adequate support for the indications claimed: 1 Recognised Pharmacopoeia 4; 2 Recognised Monograph 4; 3 Three independent written histories of use in the classical or traditional medical literature, or 4 Citations from other in vivo, in vitro studies, case reports or others. 1 Health enhancement claims apply to enhancement of normal health. They do not relate to enhancement of health from a compromis ed state. 2 All claims relating to symptoms must be accompanied by the advice \"If symptoms persist consult your relevant health care provider \". 3 Refer to section 5.1 i) - vi) 4 Refer to section 5.1 vii) - ix) and ANNEXURE D 5 In cultures where an oral tradition is clearly documented, evidence of use from an oral tradition would be considered accepta ble provided the history of use is authenticated. Modern texts that accurately report or confirm the classical or traditional liter ature may be used to support claims. Traditional claims should refer to corresponding traditional descriptions of the condition(s). 6 Terms used must be in accordance with the practice of the associated discipline . Registration of Medicines: CMs DS Safety & Efficacy June 2020 7.01_CMs_SE_DS_Jun20_v3_1 Page 21 of 47 Back to ToC 4.2 Documenting safety 4.2.1 Safety The safety section should include the following: overview of safety; any studies that address specific safety issues; reports (where possible) of adverse effects reported to the National Adverse Drug Event Monitoring Centre reports of adverse effect s from accepted international sources any studies not submitted in the efficacy section that have been referred to in the overview; post-marketing data. Full evidence of tissue residue data of p roducts which have been used in animals destined for human consumption must be include d. There is no need to submit duplicate copies of studies submitted in the efficacy section. However, the location of the studies in the application should be clearly identified. 4.2.2 Overview o f Safety The overview of safety provides a concise critical assessment of the safety data, noting how the results may support and justify any restrictions placed on the product. The safety profile of the medicine may be motivated using relevant in vitro, in vivo evidence or clinical studies . The data should be outlined in a detailed, clear and objective manner. Tabulations of adverse events are often helpful. There should be a description of common and expected ad verse events (both serious and non -serious). An accepted causal ity assignment determination protocol to show the relationship between the product and an event, or lack of relationship , should be provided. The following issues should be considered: the us e of the term \"natural\" should not be used to infer safety; all known interactions should be considered and detailed in the application process; adverse effects that are expected because of the mechanism of action; any likely adverse effects anticipated from animal data or product quality information (manufacturing processes); the nature of the patient population and the extent of exposure; any limitations of the safety data derived from the clinical trials (e.g. inc lusion/exclusion criteria, trial subject demographics); an outline of safety data collection in efficacy trials, with appropriate definitions of adverse events, serious adverse events, etc.; relationship of adverse events to dose, dose regimen and treatmen t duration; similarities and differences in results among studies, and their effect on the interpretation of the safety data; any differences in the rates of adverse events in population subgroups, such as those defined by demographic factors, gender, age, race, weight, concomitant illness or concomitant therapy; 2 2 Because of greater awareness of th e potential for interactions between concomitantly administered medicines, there has been an international focus on interaction studies rather than on ad hoc observational studies. Guidance on points to consider when assessing interaction studies is given in Registration of Medicines: CMs DS Safety & Efficacy June 2020 7.01_CMs_SE_DS_Jun20_v3_1 Page 22 of 47 Back to ToC long-term safety; any methods to prevent, mitigate or manage adverse events; overdose reactions, potential for dependence, rebound phenomena and abuse, or the lack of data on these aspects eviden ce of lack of efficacy . 4.3 Post Marketing Data The applicant should include all data on the worldwide marketing experience, including all relevant Post - Marketing data available to the applicant. This may include published and unpublished data. Any new or different safety issues identified following marketing and thereafter should be highlighted and any regulatory action relating to safety taken by an overseas regulatory agency should be detailed. Details of the number of people estimated to have been exposed should be provided and categorised, as appropriate, by indication, dosage, route of administration, treatment duration and geographical location. This usually requires special \"pharmacovigilance\" techniques such as prescription event monitorin g. The data should be presented as a tabulation of the adverse events that have been reported, including any serious adverse events using the definition of SAE's in the SAHPRA's ADR guideline and any potentially serious interactions with other medicines. Furthermore, the applicant should collect, collate and maintain a record of all adverse reactions after they have been reported for the registered product and this should be available for inspection to the SAHPRA in accordance with the ADR guideline (Repor ting Adverse Drug Reactions in South Africa).

It is important that the applicant ensures that the data in the study report and the publication are consistent. Any differences should be explained in detail. Evidence of non -interference by the applicant and the independence of the researchers must be given. If in-house studies are done this must be explicit and all steps taken to reduce bias disclosed. 6 SCHEDULING Any motivation or proposal of a scheduling status should consider the safety of the medicine, level of indication and suitably justify for the level of access associated with the proposed schedule. 7 UNACCEPTABLE PRESENTATION The presentation (including package inserts, patient information leaflets, labelling and packaging) of complementary medicines is unacceptable if it is capable of being misleading or confusing as to the content or proper use of the medicines. Particular care must be taken in South Africa to ensure that any translation of languages is not only accurate, but idiomatically sound so that incorrect m essages are not conveyed. In addition, the presentation of complementary medicines is unacceptable: if the words \"natural\" and \"gentle\" are used to imply safety if it states or suggests that the product ha s ingredients, components or characteristics that it does not have; if a name applied to the product is the same as the name applied to other products that are already supplied in South Africa, where those other products contain additional or different ther apeutically active ingredients (refer to the current SAHPRA Naming Guideline) ; if the label of the product does not declare the presence of a therapeutically active ingredient; if a form of presentation of the product may lead to unsafe use of the product or suggests a purpose that is not in accordance with conditions applicable to the sale of the product in South Africa, or could be confused with an existing registered or unregistered \"brand\"; or if the format of the submissions does not comply with curren t SAHPRA guidelines. In such a case, the submission may be returned to the applicant and any fee forfeited.

Biological substances are not uniquely defined by a chemical name because their purity, strength and composition cannot readily be determined by chemical analysis. Substances which can be isolated as a low molecular mass pure substance, such as purified steroids, digoxin and ergotamine, are considered to be chemical substances. Clinical trial means an investigation in respect of a medicine for use in humans and animals that involves human subjects or animals and that is intended to discover or verify the clinical, pharmacological or pharmacodynamic effects of the medicine, identify any adverse events, s tudy the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of the medicine or ascertain its safety or efficacy Combination product means a single product that contains: a) a mixture of substances of various discipline specific origin or philosophy ; b) a mixture of at least one substance of discipline specific origin and one or more health supplements, or c) a mixture of at least one substance of discipline -specific origin and one or more of its isolated constituents.

Good manufacturing practice (GMP) Good Manufacturing Practice is that part of Quality Assurance which ensures that products are consistently produced and controlled to the quality standards appropriate to their intended use and as required by the medicine registration or product specification and is concerned with both production and quality control. The acronym GMP is used internationally to describe a set of principles and procedures which , when followed by manufacturers of medicines, helps ensure that the products manufactured will have the required quality. A basic tenet of GMP is that quality cannot only be tested into a batch of product but must be built into each batch of product duri ng all stages of the manufacturing process. Health supplement means any substance, extract or mixture of substances as determined by the Authority, sold in dosage forms used or purported for use in restoring, correcting or modifying any physical or mental state by - (a) complementing health; (b) supplementing the diet; or (c) a nutritional effect, and excludes injectable preparations, medicines or substances listed as Schedule 1 or higher in the Act; Herbal substance / preparation, in any discipline, means all or part of a plant, fungus, alga, seaweed or lichen, or other substance: a) that is obtained only by drying, crushing, distilling, freezing, fermentation, lyophilisation, extracting, expressing, co mminuting, mixing with an inert diluent substance or another herbal substance or mixing with water, ethanol, glycerol, oil or aqueous ethanol; or other permitted solvents; with or without the addition of heat; b) that is not subjected to any other treatment o r process other than a treatment or process that is necessary for its presentation in a pharmaceutical form, and c) where part of a plant, fungus, seaweed or lichen refers to a structure such as rhizome, mycelium, fruiting body, or outer bark, wood, meristematic Registration of Medicines: CMs DS Safety & Efficacy June 2020 7.01_CMs_SE_DS_Jun20_v3_1 Page 28 of 47 Back to ToC tissue, shoot, bud, thallus, resin, oleoresin, gum, natural exudate or secretion, gall, leaf, frond, flower (or its parts), inflorescence, pollen, fruit, seed, cone, spores or other whole plant part, an d d) that does not include: i) a pure chemical or isolated constituent unless the isolated herbal constituent is formulated with the herbal substance from which it arises and is demonstrated to have \"essentially the same\"3 action as the whole herbal substanc e, or ii) a substance of mineral, animal or bacterial origin.
