Screen a patient at every immunization visit to find out if they are eligible for VFC or not. Document thevaccine eligibility code in the patient's medical record. Administer VFC vaccine only to a child or adolescent through age 18 who meets VFC eligibility criteria. Keep all records that relate to VFC for a minimum of three years. This includes: \u00bbBorrowing logs \u00bbTemperature logs, and \u00bbVaccine storage troubleshooting records. Keep the current Vaccine Management Guide in a place where it is easily accessible to clinic staff working with vaccines. Dispose of outdated materials promptly. Offer all routinely recommended Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) vaccines. Make non-routine ACIP recommended vaccines available. Provide a current Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) in the patient's primary language. Do so at everyimmunization visit before administering vaccine. Ensure all VIS documents are up-to-date and discard out-of-date VISs. Maintain records in accordance with the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA). Do not charge for the cost of a state-supplied vaccine. Do not bill an administration fee in excess of $21.96 to a patient who receives state-supplied vaccine. Waive administration fees on state-supplied vaccine if a patient cannot pay. Comply with standards outlined in Oregon Administrative Rule 333.047: \u00bbReport all immunizations to ALERT Immunization Information System (IIS) with a valid vaccineeligibility code within 14 days of administration. \u00bbUse the ALERT IIS inventory and ordering modules to manage your private and state-suppliedvaccine stocks. \u00bbEnsure at least two clinic employees complete three Oregon VFC online training modules on vaccinemanagement at least once every other year. Comply with all VFC standards for vaccine management as outlined in this guide. Standards include: \u00bbA written plan for vaccine management. \u00bbUse of storage equipment and thermometers that meet requirements outlined in this document.Section 1: VFC requirementsVaccine Management GuidePage 2Section 1: VFC requirements \u00bbDocument minimum and maximum temperatures daily. Review of digital data loggers weekly. \u00bbNotify the Oregon Immunization Program (OIP) when state-supplied vaccine has been stored outside the appropriate temperature range. \u00bbProvide OIP with temperature logs when requested. \u00bbComply with VFC transfer and vaccine return policies. \u00bbComply with OIP's policy on vaccine borrowing. Recertify with the program yearly. This includes reviewing and updating the VFC Provider Agreementand Profile. Ensure at least the primary and back-up VFC contacts complete the \"Oregon VFC Overview and Self-Assessment\" training module once a year. Fully take part in VFC program compliance visits. This includes unannounced site visits. Public providers who have signed a Deputization Memorandum of Understanding with a Federally QualifiedHealth Center (FQHC) or Rural Health \"walk-in\" VFC-eligible children.* Pharmacies, urgent care school-located vaccine clinics agree to vaccinate all \"walk-in\"VFC-eligible children.* Ensure at least two clinic staff maintain a subscription to the Oregon VFC Listserv. This Listserv is theprimary way requirements are communicated to Oregon VFC clinics. Unless otherwise named, requirements apply to both state-supplied and privately purchased vaccine. * \" W alk-in\" refers to any VFC-eligible child who requests a vaccine, not just established patients. Providers do not have to serve patients without an appointment. If a provider's office policy is for all patients to make anappointment for vaccines, the policy applies to VFC patients as well.Vaccine Management GuidePage 3Section 2: Employee training plan VFC training requirements and recommendations TrainingRequired/ recommendedWho should take it How often Website Review Vaccine Management GuideRequired All staff handling vaccine Every year n/a VFC VFC coordinator (other immunizing staff recommended)Every two years ALERT IIS standard user trainings Required All staff accessing ALERT IIS Once http://bit.ly/ EnrollALERT ALERT IIS super user Required At least one person per clinic Once ALERT IIS vaccine inventory Required Anyone helping with inventory Once http://bit.ly/ ALERTInventoryALERT IIS vaccine ordering RequiredAnyone ordering state-supplied vaccineOnce ALERT IIS vaccine borrowing Required Anyone helping with inventory Once ALERT IIS reports (accountability, ad hoc, assessment, reminder/recall, data monitoring, etc.)RecommendedStaff involved in quality assurance and improvementWhen neededhttp://bit.ly/ ReportsTraining Clinic-specific training TrainingRequired/ recommendedWho should take it How often Website Note: Clinics must keep the most recent training certificates for VFC-related training that staff members attend.Vaccine Management GuidePage 4Section 2: Employee training plan VFC task list VFC clinic staff must ensure that vaccine is appropriately stored and managed at all times.

You can still bill Medicaid for the vaccine administration fee for a Medicaid-eligible child that receives VFC vaccines. Unpaid administration fees may not be sent to collections. The provider may not refuse to vaccinate an eligible child whose parents have unpaid vaccine administration fees. Documenting vaccine administration All vaccine administration records must contain the following data elements in accordance with the NCVIA. Address of clinic where vaccine was administered Name, manufacturer and lot number of vaccine administered Date of administration Name and title of the person administering the vaccine, and VIS publication date and date VIS was provided to patient.Vaccine Management GuidePage 7Section 3: Vaccine eligibility, billing and documentation Documenting adverse events Immunization providers must report all clinically significant adverse events that occur after administration of vaccines to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). They must do so, even if they are not sure whether the vaccine caused the adverse event. VAERS accepts all reports. This includes reports of vaccination errors. There are two ways to file a VAERS report: Online \u2014 https://vaers.hhs.gov/esub/index.jsp When you use the online form, you must complete the report in a single session. It cannot be saved. This is the fastest method if you are able to complete it in one session. PDF \u2014 https://vaers.hhs.gov/uploadFile/index.jsp You can download and complete a PDF offline. Return to this webpage once you complete the form. Upload the form to finish the process. Use a computer where you can securely save documents that contain protected health information. Before starting your VAERS report make sure you have the following information on hand: Patient information (age, date of birth, sex) Vaccine information (brand name, dose number, lot number) Date, time and location administered Date and time when adverse event started Symptoms and outcome of the adverse event Medical tests and laboratory results (if applicable), and Physician's contact information (if applicable).Vaccine Management GuidePage 8Managing your inventory Clinics must keep adequate inventories of vaccine for both privately insured and VFC-eligible children they serve. Clinics should keep six weeks of vaccine. Plan your orders in advance so you have enough vaccine to serve your patients but avoid unnecessary waste. Clinics are required to: 1.Enter public and private vaccine stock into ALERT IIS before administering doses. 2.Report all doses to ALERT IIS with an eligibility code within 14 days of administration. 3.Count vaccine in the refrigerator and freezer. Compare the numbers to your ALERT IIS inventory monthly. You must submit a reconciled inventory count in ALERT IIS to place an order. 4.Rotate vaccine stock to make sure that you use vaccines will expire first. Receiving vaccine Providers must be on site to receive state-supplied vaccine: At least one day a week, For at least four consecutive hours, and On a day other than Monday. Deliveries will only be during the hours and days you designate in ALERT IIS. Do not reject state-supplied vaccine shipments. Accept delivery and contact the VFC Help Desk if there is an issue. 1.Open your vaccine shipment immediately. 2.Check the temperature indicators (if included) in the shipping container. Make sure the vaccine stayed at therecommended temperature range during shipment. Contact the VFC Help Desk if the temperature indicatorsshow exposure to out-of-range temperatures. 3.Be sure your delivery matches the packing slip and the ALERT IIS order transfer. Check: \u00bbVaccine brands \u00bbExpiration dates \u00bbLot numbers, and \u00bbQuantities. If your order is fulfilled in more than one shipment, the packing list will state what is in each box rather than the whole order. 4.Place the vaccine into your refrigerator or freezer. Rotate vaccine stock to make sure you use first vaccinesthat expire first. 5.Accept the vaccine order transfer in ALERT IIS to add the order to your inventory.Section 4: Inventory managementVaccine Management GuidePage 9Section 4: Inventory management Reconciling your inventory Staff should: Count physical inventory at least monthly Compare physical inventory to ALERT IIS inventory, and Adjust inventory in ALERT IIS to match. Staff must do so: No more than two weeks before placing an order, or More often as part of data quality work. Reconciling inventory: 1.Print inventory count list from ALERT IIS. 2.Compare quantity shown in ALERT with physical inventory by lot number. Make a note of difference. 3.Troubleshoot inventory issues. Identify preventable errors such as wrong lot numbers or inventory not entered in ALERT IIS. 4.Ad hoc report for inventory management training: http://bit.ly/ReportsTraining 5.Make any corrections you need to your ALERT IIS inventory. 6.Inventory adjustment tip sheet: http://bit.ly/adjustinventory 7.Submit your reconciled inventory count. 8.Develop a plan for avoiding preventable errors and train staff. Returning spoiled and expired vaccine If you have spoiled or expired state-supplied vaccine, do not throw it away. You must return it to McKesson Distribution within six months of spoilage or expiration. Providers may be required to replace vaccine spoiled or expired due to negligence. To return state-supplied vaccine: 1.Complete the survey to report nonviable vaccine at : https://app.smartsheet.com /b/publish?EQBCT= 39b3a29039484cc5aa3be7b27e217116 2.OIP will ask for a return shipping label from an express carrier. The label will arrive by U.S. mail or email from the carrier. 3.Pack nonviable vac cine to protect from breakage. 4.Contact carrier for pick-up if you do not already have a regular pick-up date with them. To return vaccine bought privately: Contact your private vaccine supplier for guidance on return or disposal of spoiled or expired private vaccine. To correct your inventory in ALERT IIS, create a new transfer of the expired vaccine to remove it from inventory: Under the Inventory menu, select Manage Transfers Then click New Transfer.Vaccine Management GuidePage 10Section 4: Inventory management Select OIP Expired Vaccine Returns as the Receiving Organization for the transfer. To remove wasted or spoiled vaccine from ALERT inventory, select Modify Quantity on the Show Inventory screen. See tip sheet for adjusting inventory: http://bit.ly/adjustinventory Short-dated vaccine It is the clinic's responsibility to make sure to use vaccine before it expires. Clinics should plan for short-dated vaccine three months before it expires. There are two options to use up the vaccine: Option 1: Run a Reminder/Recall report either in ALERT IIS or in an electronic health record for patients who are due or past due for the vaccine. ALERT IIS Reminder/Recall tip sheet: http://bit.ly/ReminderRecallRpt Option 2: Transfer vaccine to another VFC clinic that can use the vaccine. Use the Oregon VFC Provider Map to find a nearby clinic: http://bit.ly/VFCProviderMap Staff at the VFC Help Desk can help with either option. Borrowing vaccine between VFC and private stock In rare circumstances, VFC providers can borrow between their state-supplied and private stock of vaccines. It's OK to borrow when: There are vaccine delivery delays Vaccine is damaged in transit There is a temporary vaccine shortage You use short-dated vaccine to prevent vaccine expiration You use private flu vaccine to vaccinate VFC-eligible children. (When VFC stock becomes available, replace borrowed private doses.) It's not OK to borrow when: Doing so may result in no vaccine for VFC patients It is routine It is a repeated human error You run out of stock between orders You use VFC flu vaccine for a non-VFC patient. What to do when you borrow: Document every instance of borrowing on the borrowing log, available at http://bit.ly/VFCProviderResources Update the ALERT IIS inventory to reflect the borrowing pay back. Replace all doses within 90 days. Submit completed borrowing reports to OIP.Vaccine Management GuidePage 11Refrigerator and freezer requirements All vaccine storage units must meet the following requirements: The unit must be able to keep required vaccine storage temperatures: \u00bbRefrigerator: 2\u00b0- Celsius (5\u00b0 - -58\u00b0 Fahrenheit). The unit must be large enough to store the year's largest inventory while it keeps the proper temperatures. The unit must contain a centrally located, digital data logger with a buffered probe. The unit must be dedicated to storage of vaccines (and other pharmaceuticals only as necessary). Food and beverages must not be stored in a vaccine storage unit. This practice results in frequent door opening and temperature destabilization. Do Not Use dorm-style refrigerators for vaccine storage under any circumstances. Separate and clearly label stocks bought privately and state-supplied vaccine. Plug storage units into ordinary outlets. Do not plug storage units into: \u00bbOutlets controlled by a wall switch \u00bbOutlets with built-in circuit switches \u00bbExtension cords, or \u00bbSurge protectors. Place \"Do Not Unplug\" stickers near the outlet and on storage equipment circuit breakers. You may not use new storage units until a week of temperature logs are approved by the VFC Help Desk. When you move storage units to a new location, monitor temperatures for 48 hours before you store vaccine in the unit. To help stabilize temperatures in the unit, place water bottles throughout the unit*: \u00bbAgainst the walls of the unit \u00bbIn the back of the unit \u00bbOn the floor of the unit, and \u00bbIn the doors of the unit.Section 5: Storage and handling * Water bottles are required for commercial and homestyle units; recommended for pharmaceutical units.Vaccine Management GuidePage 12Section 5: Storage and handling Refrigerator and freezer recommendations Use pharmacy or biologic-grade storage units specifically designed for vaccine storage. Use stand-alone refrigerators and stand-alone freezer units only. (VFC may not allow household units may in the future.) Install plug guards or locks on outlets. Store vaccine in mesh trays or trays with holes that allow air circulation. Store vaccine in original box to prevent exposure to light. Thermometer requirements VFC clinics are required to keep one digital data logger for every vaccine storage unit. Each clinic must have at least one back-up digital data logger. These loggers must: Test for calibration at least once every 24 months or per manufacturer specifications. Certificates of calibration must include: \u00bbModel number \u00bbSerial number \u00bbCalibration date, of instrument passing testing. Have a buffered temperature probe (glycol, glass beads or similar). Be able to display a minimum and maximum temperature since the last check of the logger. Thermometer recommendations In addition to the above requirements, we strongly recommend data loggers have: An alarm for out of range temperatures. An accuracy of +/-0.5\u00b0C (+/-1\u00b0F). A low battery indicator. Memory storage for at least 4,000 readings. A logging interval set to once every 15 minutes. Be stored in the refrigerator so they are pre-chilled and ready to use. For more information about refrigerators, freezers and thermometers check out our guides at http://bit.ly/VFCProviderResourcesVaccine Management GuidePage 13Section 5: Storage and handling Temperature monitoring 1.Check and record minimum and maximum temperatures at the start of each clinic day on your digital data logger. Temperatures must remain in the following ranges: \u00bbRefrigerator: 2\u00b0 - -50\u00b0 Celsius (5\u00b0 - -58\u00b0 Fahrenheit) The following must be recorded in the temperature log: \u00bbExact time the temperature is checked, and \u00bbThe initials of the person who records it. Note: Minimum and maximum temperatures recorded must be those reached since the last time temperatures were recorded. If your data logger has an automatic reset, you may have to review multiple measurement periods to capture all temperatures since you last reviewed them. A tip sheet for reading your device is at: http://bit.ly/minmaxguide You can find temperature logs here: http://bit.ly/VFCProviderResources . 2.Download and review digital data logger every week: \u00bbPreferably Monday mornings, or \u00bbWhen you return to the clinic after a weekend or day closure. (Data may be saved on the cloud instead of downloading.) 3.Keep temperature monitoring documentation for three years. This includes: \u00bbData from digital data loggers \u00bbDaily temperature logs \u00bbData from alarm systems, and \u00bbVaccine storage troubleshooting records. 4.Test your alarm system quarterly. Document the results on your vaccine storage troubleshooting record (e.g., warming the thermometer or probe to intentionally trigger the alarm).Vaccine Management GuidePage 14Section 5: Storage and handling Responding to out of range temperatures If temperatures are out of range: 1. Restrict use of the refrigerator or freezer. Place a \"DO NOT USE\" sign on the unit. Also, notify your clinic's primary responsible staff. 2. Determine the cause and take action. The temperature excursion scenarios below give examples of how you might handle different types of excursions. 3. Notify the VFC Help Desk at 971-673-4VFC (4832) or vfc.help@dhsoha.state.or.us (You don't need to notify VFC if temperatures go out of range for less than half an hour or less than one degree Celsius.) 4. Document the incident. Include the: \u00bbLength of excursion \u00bbMinimum and maximum temperatures \u00bbSteps taken to address the excursion, and \u00bbOutcome in your vaccine storage troubleshooting record, available here: http://bit.ly/ VFCProviderResources .Vaccine Management GuidePage 15Section 5: Storage and handling Temperature excursion scenarios There is a slight temperature change due to an inventory count or door left ajar: Close the door. Recheck temperature in 30 minutes. Make sure it returned to the recommended temperature range. There is a slight temperature excursion due to an unknown cause: Make a slight adjustment to the thermostat or follow your clinic's protocol. Recheck temperatures in 30 minutes. If temperatures return to the normal range, continue to monitor temperatures closely until you are confident you have not over-adjusted. Make sure your storage unit can maintain the appropriate temperature. If temperatures have not returned to normal range, move vaccine to a functioning unit. There is a major excursion and your refrigerator or freezer appears to be malfunctioning: Move vaccine to a functioning storage unit. (See vaccine emergency plan) Get the malfunctioning unit serviced. You may also want to contact the manufacturer of your vaccine storage equipment for guidance. You suspect the excursion is due to a malfunctioning thermometer (rather than a true excursion): Restrict use of the refrigerator or freezer. Place a \"DO NOT USE\" sign on the unit. Notify your clinic's primary responsible staff. Place a back-up thermometer in the storage unit to confirm the temperature reading. There is a power outage: Contact your power company to see how long the outage may last. Do not move your vaccine if the power outage is expected to last less than four hours. Most storage units will maintain temperatures during brief power outages as long as the door remains closed. If the power outage is expected to last longer than four hours, move the vaccine to your alternate storage facility. (See vaccine emergency plan.) For all scenarios, notify the VFC Help Desk if the temperature is out of range for: More than half an hour, or More than one degree Celsius.Vaccine Management GuidePage 16Section 5: Storage and handling Off-site and mass vaccination storage requirements Clinics that hold off-site or mass vaccination clinics must meet below storage and handling standards. This ensures the vaccine administered is safe and effective. One person should be responsible for off-site clinic vaccine storage and handling. This includes: Vaccine transport plans Portable storage unit operation Inventory management plan Off-site clinic temperature logs, available here: http://bit.ly/VFCProviderResources Off-site clinic emergency plan, and Training staff who work at the clinic on vaccine storage and handling. Main clinic storage Vaccine transport Day storage Vaccination station Holds multiple weeks' worth of vaccine stock. Adheres to all VFC storage and handling requirements. No more than one day's worth of vaccine transported. Use of purpose-built vaccine transport containers recommended. If a purpose-built container is unavailable, transport according to transport instructions on page 16. Include vaccine inventory count list. Monitor temps using a digital data logger with a buffered probe. Document minimum and maximum temps on arrival and after return to main clinic. Unpack vaccines and move them to day storage immediately. Store only one day's worth of vaccine. Use a purpose built vaccine transport container or portable powered storage unit. Units must be tested in advance to ensure ability to maintain required temps. Include water bottles to ensure stable temps. Monitor temps using a digital data logger with a buffered probe. Take hourly temp readings and document minimum and maximum at end of day. Download and review the temp logs at the end of event. No more than 10 doses or one hour's worth of vaccine should be stored at vaccination stations. Store vaccine in a small cooler (lunch pail or similar size). One or two conditioned water bottles in bottom. Insulating layer between water bottles and vaccine. Out of range temps Immediately relocate the vaccine to stable backup unit and label vaccines \"DO NOT USE.\" Contact the Oregon VFC Help Desk (971-673-4832) to determine vaccine viability. Vaccine Management GuidePage 17 Activate your emergency plan and transport your vaccine to your alternate storage facility, if: The vaccine storage unit is out of range and will not return to the appropriate temperatures for four hours or more, or There is a major temperature excursion. Emergency vaccine transport Step 1: Gather materials Hard-sided coolers, coolers built for vaccine transport, or foam vaccine shipping containers. Insulating filler material Cardboard Conditioned water bottles for refrigerated vaccine, frozen water bottles for frozen vaccine, or other transport material approved by OIP.Digital data logger Current vaccine inventory - ALERT IIS printout Step 2: Arrange delivery with accepting clinic Contact alternate storage facility with estimated time of arrival and approximate length of storage time. Step 3: Pack for transport Use a Styrofoam or hard sided cooler at least 2 inches thick designed for transporting vaccines. Place a layer of conditioned frozen water bottles (for refrigerated vaccine) or frozen water bottles (for frozen vaccine) in the bottom of the transport container. To condition water bottles, run them under warm water for a few minutes until they begin to thaw and the ice spins freely inside the bottle. Cover water bottles with a layer of cardboard. Cover the layer of cardboard with 1-2 inches of filler material (e.g., bubble wrap or crumpled paper) to ensure vaccines do not touch the water bottles or shift during transport. Place the vaccine in a plastic bag with a calibrated digital data logger (the display goes on the outside of the container). Place the bag on top of the filler material. Place another layer, 1-2 inches, of filler material on top of vaccines. Top with another layer of cardboard. Place another layer of conditioned frozen water bottles or frozen water bottles on top of cardboard. Add vaccine inventory printout from ALERT IIS. Secure any gaps in the container with filler material. Seal with packing tape. Affix digital data logger display on the outside of the container, on top of the lid. Affix \"Rush! Vaccine Perishable\" and \"Do Not Freeze\" stickers transport container.Section 6: Vaccine emergency planVaccine Management GuidePage 18 Section 6: Vaccine emergency plan Step 4: Arrive at destination Unpack and properly store vaccines. Record minimum and maximum temperatures for the transport period. Step 5: Document the event When the vaccine is safely back at your clinic, document the transport in your vaccine storage troubleshooting record. Contact the VFC Help Desk at 971-673-4VFC (4832) to report the emergency before administering vaccine. When external temperatures are below 20\u00b0F or above 85\u00b0F, only transport if necessary. Before doing so, contact the OIP. Do not leave the insulated container in an unconditioned location such as the trunk of a vehicle. Drive directly to the receiving site to minimize transport time. Do not use non-phase change gel cold packs or dry ice to transport vaccine. Always use digital data loggers to monitor temperatures during transport. Frozen vaccine must be transported separately from refrigerated vaccine.
