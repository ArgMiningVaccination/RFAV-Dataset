All organizations to varying degrees are dependent on the health of the natural world. Organizations also impact on nature's health, both positively and negatively. Understanding the complex and dynamic relationships that organizations have with the health of natural assets and the ecosystem services they provide enables organizations to make more informed decisions. A capitals approach empowers organizations to deliver benefits their employees, society, the broader economy and the natural world alongside their businesses. Download the Protocol Download the Natural Capital Protocol to explore your impacts and dependencies on natural capital. [Click here for translations](#protocol-translations-modal) and [here for the Primer for business.](https://capitalscoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/NCC_Primer_WEB_2016-07-08.pdf) Without an understanding of their impacts and dependencies on natural capital, many decision-makers will be unaware of potentially significant risks and opportunities and will therefore be at least partly 'flying blind'. Consequently, they can make decisions that are inefficient, ineffective or damaging. A capitals approach broadens the quantity and quality of business-relevant information available to decision-makers. Traditionally the value of natural capital has, for the most part, been excluded from decision-making. Even when included, methods have been inconsistent, open to interpretation, limited to moral arguments or based on an incomplete understanding of organizational relationships to natural capital. The Natural Capital Protocol responds to this gap by offering an internationally standardized framework for the identification, measurement and valuation of impacts and dependencies on natural capital in order to inform organizational decisions. [The Protocol Framework](https://capitalscoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/NCC_Framework.pdf) explores 4 Stages broken down into 9 Steps which contain questions to be answered when integrating the value of natural capital into organizational processes. Although set out in a linear way, the Protocol is iterative and allows users to adjust and adapt their approach as they progress through the framework. The Protocol Framework covers 4 stages centred around the questions: Why? What? How? and What Next? 01 Frame (Why?) Identify risks and opportunities for your business and stakeholders resulting from your relationships with natural capital and explore how an assessment would be relevant to your decision making. 02 Scope (What?) Identify the objective of your assessment and conduct a materiality process to select the most relevant impacts and dependencies from the perspective of both your business and stakeholders. 03 Measure & Value (How?) Use relevant approaches to measure and value the costs and benefits resulting from your material impacts and dependencies on natural capital. 04 Apply (What Next?) Interpret, validate and verify your assessment process and results and integrate them into existing business processes to inform decision-making. The Natural Capital Protocol is applicable within any business sector to organizations of all sizes and in all operational geographies. The Protocol is also applicable at multiple organizational levels and scopes, for example at a product, project or organizational level. It allows you to measure, value and integrate natural capital impacts and dependencies into existing business processes such as risk mitigation, sourcing, supply chain management and product design. The Protocol is focused on informing business decision-making. The decisions you make will help to define and deliver against your strategy which can then flow into your external disclosure and stakeholder engagement. New Online Business Training Course Released The Capitals Coalition offers a free online business training course on the Coursera platform, supported by We Value Nature. Natural Capital Protocol Toolkit The [Natural Capital Protocol Toolkit](https://shift.tools/contributors/551), was developed by [WBCSD](http://www.wbcsd.org/Clusters/Natural-Capital-and-Ecosystems/Natural-Capital-Protocol-Toolkit) and facilitates uptake of the [Protocol](https://naturalcapitalcoalition.org/protocol/) by consolidating the wealth of tools, methodologies and approaches available for natural capital measurement and valuation. The Toolkit is hosted by [MIT SHIFT](http://mitsloan.mit.edu/sustainability/shift), an [MIT Sloan Sustainability](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/sustainability-initiative/welcome) initiative. The Capitals Checker The Capitals Checker provides practitioners with a self-assessment tool to assess, communicate and improve the level of confidence in their assessments. The Checker helps organizations to evaluate how credible and fit-for-purpose assessments are, and the level of confidence that stakeholders can place in the process, results, and decisions made.
