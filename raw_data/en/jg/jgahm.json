But, I'm just not sure it needs the ultra-organized commercialized dogma of the Dr.Sha \"Mission\": First of all, similar to his previous books, don't be duped by the \"best seller\" status or 5 star ratings: 1) members of the Mission contribute thousands of dollars in lieu of 'blessings' from Master Sha as a part of a 'book campaign' - these funds are used directly by Master Sha's institute to internally buy books from retailers 2 or 3 at a time to falsely and unethically stage the book's popularity (Google \"Dr Sha book campaign\" if you don't believe me) 2) members of the Mission are urged to write positive reviews about Master Sha's books, and get discounts for it...thus all the prosaic 5 star reviews. It's not really that they want to sell lots of books - they want to attract more members to the Mission- i.e. to join the Sunday Blessings and the Retreats....which is where the real money is made. It's not that unlike this story: google \"Did dirty tricks create a best-seller\" Sure, the members deeply believe that they are promoting truth (indeed, other religions have done much worse in the name of God)...but personally, I don't find these methods to be all that 'saintly'(it might even be karmic)... if there are real truths in the book and the Mission it would sell itself on its own merit like most best sellers do. And what 'services' does Master Sha offer at his blessings and retreats? Well, Master Sha believes that he is a \"Channel\" of the Divine, and he (and only he) has been given special powers. So he (and only he) can offer you- via the \"Dr Sha dot com\" channel (check it out for yourself): - Divine Protection against every imaginable hazard - clear your Karma for $2000. just like that - no followup or practice or nothing...even Dr, Sha calls it a \"short cut\" - Transplants for diseased organs - Body Soul Transplant for $5000 (not explicitly listed in the web site, but it is a prerequisite, among others, to be come a Master Teacher Healer) - Etc. (actually, you can usually get the blessings for less because there is always a last minute special to appeal to the \"shoppers\") What is a Body Soul Transplant? You current soul leaves you and a new soul (a saint) chooses you. Its sad that some people are so down they feel they need a brand new soul....and I guess all the poor folks have little chance at becoming a saint...how exclusive. By the way, for the higher services, you aren't told the cost of these until you apply first, in which Dr. Sha receives Divine guidance in whether he should accept you. Imagine trying to say no after the Divine supposedly accepted you (but of course, these are \"priceless treasures\"). But that's just the tip of the iceberg...the later chapters of his books speak of the higher Soul Transformations etc. The \"highest\" downloads for the 'chosen' ones are offered only at the \"invitation only\" retreats (i.e. for those who have 'passed' the previous courses)... Dr Sha's Sunday blessings are as follows: He offers a free blessing (download). Then his top assistants (the \"professionals\" on \"dr sha dot com\" who have gone through the full Soul transformation and have received all the highest downloads so that their souls reside in their highest chakra and they can see with their third eye- paid for either with $ or Universal Service to the Mission) describe what they saw. Then all the people who have registered get their downloads. That's it. Yes, the downloads might feel empowering, but inevitably you are left wanting more...if the top assistants can really see with their third eye, wouldn't you want that too? Well you can get there by getting the downloads, becoming indoctrinated through the courses and practice practice practice (the practice e.g. chanting, empowering statements etc can make you feel good) - till you believe it (or some would say become deluded?) So inevitably, most are drawn to take the courses and to become a Universal Servant (requires you to volunteer time to the non-profit Institute that does all the 'work' - whereas payments go to Dr Zhi Gang Sha LLC.). The courses all link together and coax you higher and higher, with the light at the end of the tunnel that eventually you might be able to charge for your services, like the \"Professionals\" on the web site - it's the classic pyramid marketing scheme. But here is the hard part for me: people DO feel better... faith in the empowerments can help heal. But any one will feel better if they spend time getting out of their thinking brain and doing some chanting, setting good intentions, and having faith that they are empowered to make choices to make their lives better. And the collective energy at (any) group retreats is very powerful and healing. Why not rejoice in that - it might be the piece some people really need... But when that collective energy at the retreat is highest, and people are feeling their best, that is when Dr. Sha 'suggests' that his downloads can make you even better....which is made so easily done by sticking your personal barcode on a form (& voila, your credit card is charged). It's so effective that retreat registrants have to sign a legal disclaimer saying that all though the downloads are 'priceless', they must spend 'within their means\". From my experience, few of the faithful do, unless you call credit card bills and liquidation of savings as 'within your means\". (many retreat attendees spend 10's of thousands) Seems like Dr. Sha is selling water to people standing in a river. It's a shame that our consumerist society thinks we can 'buy' everything. Its part of the reason we need a true soul movement. Members of the Mission have made a huge leap of faith to jump on these tracks. But the light at the end of the tunnel might just be an oncoming train. After investing so much, it might take an even bigger leap of faith to get off... 3 people found this helpful Book preview Soul Mind Body Medicine - Zhi Gang Sha, MD Author Preface Ihave three missions. My first life mission is to teach healing, empowering people to heal themselves and others. My message for healing is: I have the power to heal myself. You have the power to heal yourself. Together, we have the power to heal the world. My second life mission is to teach soul wisdom, empowering people to enlighten themselves. The purpose of teaching soul wisdom is to help others fulfill their spiritual journeys, which consists of reaching soul enlightenment and further increasing one 's standing in the soul world. My message for the soul journey is: I have the power to enlighten myself. You have the power to enlighten yourself. Together, we have the power to enlighten the world. My third life mission is to offer universal service. I am a universal servant. You are a universal servant. Everyone and everything is a universal servant. A universal servant offers universal service, which includes universal love, universal forgiveness, universal peace, universal healing, universal blessing, universal harmony, and universal enlightenment. My message for universal service is: I offer universal service unconditionally. You offer universal service unconditionally. Together, we serve the universe unconditionally. With Soul Mind Body Medicine, I have created a breakthrough healing system as a vehicle to carry all three of my life missions forward. This book will teach you how to heal yourself and others. It will also teach you how to do group healing and remote or distant healing. Furthermore, it will help you totally transform your soul, mind, and body. I am honored to present Soul Mind Body Medicine to the world. My own healing journey has progressed for more than forty years, through study, self-development, clinical practice, teaching, and personal experience. I began studying tai chi at age six and qi gong at ten, and then quickly turned to the profound wisdom of kung fu, the I Ching, and feng shui. I studied Western medicine, receiving my MD in China. I also studied traditional Chinese medicine and became an herbalist and acupuncturist. From my most respected master, Dr. Zhi Chen Guo, I learned Zhi Neng medicine (Zhi Neng means the intelligence and capabilities of the mind and soul). Much of the wisdom of Soul Mind Body Medicine comes directly from Master Guo's teachings. Without them, I could not have written this book. As both an MD and a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine, I completely honor Western medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, and all other healing modalities. To create Soul Mind Body Medicine, I have synthesized the healing wisdom and knowledge of Western medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, Zhi Neng medicine, and Body Space Medicine, which I also learned from Master Guo, together with the spiritual healing knowledge gleaned from ancient philosophies and religions, including Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, and Christianity, as well as from many complementary and alternative healing modalities. I have also gained incredible wisdom and knowledge through my open spiritual channels, including my capabilities as a medical intuitive. After a lifetime of integrating all these studies and, finally, with guidance from Master Guo, my spiritual fathers in Heaven, my own soul, and the Divine (the Creator, the Source, or the universe), I have been able to develop Soul Mind Body Medicine. My main purpose in writing this book is to create a road map for what I believe will be the future direction of medicine. At the same time, I strive to give you practical tools that will empower you to heal yourself and others, right away. You can learn Soul Mind Body Medicine without any medical or healthcare background. I offer an approach to healing compatible with Western medicine and other healing modalities. This approach produces no adverse effects of any kind. It empowers you to assume a significant role in healing yourself and will assist you in restoring your health as quickly as possible. I hope that Soul Mind Body Medicine will lead you to think in a completely different way about medicine, health, healing, and life-transformation. Many powerful healing techniques are revealed in the pages that follow. Each gem of wisdom is a powerful healing tool and a universal servant for your healing needs. Use each one with love, honor, and respect and it will bring immeasurable healing and blessings into your life. Remember that unconditional universal service, including love and forgiveness, is the golden key that will unlock the gate of health for you, your loved ones, and the entire universe. May Soul Mind Body Medicine serve you and others well. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Introduction Over the past few decades, various forms of mind-body medicine have become more and more popular, to the point of being widely accepted. These modalities emphasize the mind-body connection, which encompasses the effects of our psychological and emotional states on our physical well-being and the power of conscious intent, relaxation, meditation, belief, expectation, and mind over matter to affect our health. Research in mind-body medicine is exploding. Physicians and hospitals are supporting, and in many cases even offering, mind-body practices, and health insurers are covering more of this treatment. As both a Western- and Eastern-trained medical practitioner, I think mind-body medicine is a step forward, but it is not enough. It neglects the most important factor, the soul. The soul has consciousness, intelligence, and creativity. It also has power to heal and bless. Not only your own soul (your body's soul), but also the souls of your systems, your organs, and your very cells have the power to heal themselves and to heal you. In fact, we can communicate with the souls of our body, systems, organs, and cells, and ask them to heal themselves. Since it is based on an understanding of the power of the soul, Soul Mind Body Medicine will be the breakthrough medicine for the twenty-first century. It emphasizes soul over matter as a complement to and major enhancement of mind over matter. Soul healing is the key to Soul Mind Body Medicine, and the origin of its fundamental principle: Heal the soul first; then healing of the mind and body will follow. As we learn to heal ourselves through the power of the soul, communicating with the souls of our body, systems, organs, and cells and asking them to heal themselves, we can invoke all the Buddhas, saints, healing angels, ascended masters, and the Divine (whichever entities fit with your belief system) directly to request their healing and blessings. People understand how to invoke the spiritual world to heal through prayer, but the results they receive vary greatly. The reason is that one must follow certain spiritual principles and laws to receive maximum healing benefits from the spiritual world. In this book I will teach you this profound wisdom and reveal practical treasures for its application. Practical treasures are the essence of Soul Mind Body Medicine. Many of these techniques have been carefully guarded since the time of the Yellow Emperor, five thousand years ago. They have been proven to work by tens of millions of people in China. In this book, you will find healing programs and prevention programs to restore and optimize your health, improve the quality of your life, and help you prolong your life. Soul Mind Body Medicine's healing techniques work on the soul and the consciousness of the body's systems, organs, and cells. These techniques directly and instantaneously influence matter inside the cells and energy outside the cells. They also work on the emotional body to heal emotional imbalances like depression, anxiety, fear, anger, and grief. They work on the mental body to heal mental imbalances such as delusions and confusion. Finally, they work on the spiritual body, giving you techniques for clearing bad karma. This book advances a unique theory, the Matter Energy Message Theory, to explain the cause of illness. It states that there are three main causes of ill health: matter blockages, energy blockages, and message or spiritual blockages. Matter blockages happen inside the cells. Energy blockages happen between the cells. Spiritual blockages happen in the Message Center, or heart chakra, and are due to bad karma, the sum total of mistakes one has made in this and previous lifetimes. The techniques of Soul Mind Body Medicine work by recognizing the effects of message or spiritual blockages. Matter and energy are carriers of message. Message is soul or spirit; it communicates with and influences matter and energy. If you apply Soul Mind Body Medicine healing, the interplay between matter inside the cells and energy outside the cells will be adjusted and balanced immediately. This is how the soul or message works to offer healing. It is also why prayer works as a healing agent and why soul over matter is the heart of Soul Mind Body Medicine. The real power behind soul over matter is unconditional love, forgiveness, and service. These are the golden keys to healing. Love melts all blockages. Forgiveness brings peace. Everyone and everything is a universal servant. In order to dissolve blockages and create healing, we apply unconditional love and forgiveness, along with the Four Power Techniques (Body Power, Soul Power, Sound Power, and Mind Power). Not only are these techniques simple, practical, powerful, and effective, but they are also easy to learn. In this book I offer seven major methods for healing yourself and others: 1. Say Hello Healing. This technique invokes the power of the soul to heal. It is the key to Soul Mind Body Medicine and one of the simplest and deepest healing techniques you will ever learn. You can use Say Hello Healing to request healing from the inner souls of your body, organs, and cells as well as from the outer souls of holy beings and the souls of nature. 2. Universal Meditation. Universal Meditation invokes the healing power of the soul and mind of everything, from the strands of your DNA to the sweep of the galaxies. With Universal Meditation, you can visualize any image in your own abdomen to nourish, heal, bless, manifest, and transform your life. 3. The Golden Keys to Healing. Love melts all blockages. Forgiveness brings peace. Service is the purpose of life. Use these golden keys to unlock the doors to health and the gates of life. 4. One-Minute Healing. One-Minute Healing is a quick and practical technique for removing matter, energy, and spiritual blockages. Use it anywhere, anytime, and every day to maintain your health. 5. Four Power Techniques for Common Illnesses. The Four Power Techniques are Body Power, Soul Power, Sound Power, and Mind Power. In this book, you will learn how to apply them to heal more than one hundred common health conditions. 6. Healing Programs. Consult this book for step-by-step protocols to restore your health if you are interested in boosting your energy, losing weight, reducing stress, balancing your emotions, or recovering from cancer. 7. Prevention Program. Healing is important, but prevention is vital. As the Yellow Emperor said more than five thousand years ago: The best doctor is one who teaches people how to prevent sickness, not one who treats sickness. This book teaches time-honored practices that you can apply in less than thirty minutes a day to optimize your health, boost the quality of your life, and prolong your life. The techniques are simple and practical. You can learn them right away and apply them instantly for healing. You may receive significant results after a few applications, in a few days or in a few weeks. For serious, chronic, or life-threatening conditions, it may take several weeks or months to receive significant healing results and to restore your health completely. Soul Mind Body Medicine has already transformed many lives. It works. Soul Mind Body Medicine is an unconditional universal servant, dedicated to healing you, your loved ones, your friends, and all humanity. It is also dedicated to serving every soul in the universe. It reveals profound healing techniques. It emphasizes unconditional love and forgiveness, the golden keys to healing. It guides you to realize that the purpose of life is to serve. It leads each soul to accomplish its destiny, which is to increase its spiritual standing. The final goal for every soul, on Mother Earth and in the universe, is to join as one to harmonize Heaven, Earth, and human beings. Since healing is not limited to human beings, neither is Soul Mind Body Medicine. The practical tools of this medicine can be applied to your pets, plants, organizations, society, cities, countries, Mother Earth, other planets, other galaxies, and the entire universe. Ancient spiritual philosophy states, A human being is a small universe. All of nature is a big universe. What happens in the small universe will happen in the big universe. What happens in the big universe will happen in the small universe. Soul Mind Body Medicine teaches you how to heal the small universe of a human being and the big universe of all of nature. I am an unconditional servant to every human being on Mother Earth and every soul in the universe. Open your heart and soul to receive my love and service. I am honored and dedicated to serve you. I love my heart and soul. I love all humanity. Join hearts and souls together. Love, peace, and harmony. Love, peace, and harmony. CHAPTER 1 Concepts of Soul Mind Body Medicine In this chapter, I explain the basics of Soul Mind Body Medicine, including its key theories, its diagnostic approach, and the fundamentals of healing. After reading this chapter, you will understand the key causes of sickness and how to heal from it. The rest of the book will give you a full toolbox of Soul Mind Body Medicine healing methods, including specific applications for many illnesses and guidelines for preventive maintenance. Before exploring the basic theories of Soul Mind Body Medicine, let's first take a look at some of the fundamental concepts on which the theories rest, starting with the basis of the soul's healing power, and then the relationship between physical life and spiritual life. SOUL POWER The body and its immune system possess great healing potential. When you cut your finger, the cut will heal by itself. When you catch a cold, you usually recover in a few days, even without any intervention. Even if you break a bone, the fracture will heal by itself. Soul Mind Body Medicine works with the body's inherent healing ability, expanding and deepening the potential of your body itself by focusing on the soul as the master healer. The soul has incredible healing power. But the soul of your body isn't the only soul whose power you can tap in to. Every bodily system has a soul, as does every organ, every cell, and every strand of DNA and RNA. One of the main treatments in Western medicine is using drugs to adjust the functions of the systems, organs, and cells for healing. Traditional Chinese medicine uses herbs, acupuncture, and tui na (Chinese massage) to adjust and heal. Soul Mind Body Medicine adds the power of the soul as a way to adjust and heal the systems, organs, and cells. You only need to know how to connect with the power of your many inner souls. In addition to the inner souls of your body, there are an infinite number of outer souls. Animals, oceans, mountains, trees, flowers, buildings, Mother Earth, other planets, the sun, the moon, stars, and galaxies \u2014 all have souls. In fact, everything has a soul. All these outer souls have incredible healing power also, and you will learn to use their power to heal soul, mind, and body. Billions of people believe in the spiritual world. This faith may be expressed through a religion or other belief system. I believe in the Divine (the Creator or the Source) and that, as the creator of the universe, the Divine embraces all religions and belief systems. Buddhas, saints, healing angels, and enlightened masters are all part of the Divine. They all have incredible soul healing power, so they are another incredible healing resource from the universe. We can ask these outer souls to heal our soul, mind, and body. Prayer, practiced by many whether or not in the context of a religion, is an application of Soul Power and soul healing. This book will explain the essence of prayer and why it works. It will also give you practical guidance on how to pray most effectively. With the appropriate wisdom and knowledge, you can learn to increase the power of prayer and receive healing miracles from the Divine. PHYSICAL LIFE AND SPIRITUAL LIFE The universe can be divided into yin and yang. The yang universe is the physical world we live in. The yin universe is the spiritual world, which comprises all the souls in the universe. Yin and yang are separate, yet connected. As human beings, we live in the physical world. We conduct our lives and affairs according to the laws of this physical world. Yet whether or not we consciously know or understand it, our souls must follow the laws of the spiritual world. So our physical life is inseparable from our spiritual life, and vice versa. This is becoming increasingly evident as we witness more and more people searching, consciously or subconsciously, for soul wisdom to awaken them and help fulfill their spiritual journeys. Everyone and everything has a physical life and a spiritual life. A soul or spirit in the universe has a spiritual existence; it has a spiritual life. When a soul returns as a human being, it then has a physical life. Similarly, the sun has both a physical life and a spiritual life. The moon, the planets, and the stars all have their own physical and spiritual lives. Physical life and spiritual life are distinct yet united. They serve each other. Most people are intent on fulfilling their physical lives first. In contrast, Soul Mind Body Medicine teaches you to fulfill your spiritual journey first. You will then receive great benefits for fulfilling your physical life. Heal the soul first; then healing of the mind and body will follow. Fulfill the soul first; then fulfillment of the mind and body will follow. KEY THEORIES The key theories of Soul Mind Body Medicine are simple, elegant, and easily understood, yet profound in their wisdom and application. They will give you a clear picture of why people get sick and how they can heal. These theories provide the foundation for the Soul Mind Body Medicine methods for self-healing, healing of others, group healing, and remote healing. Once you learn these methods, you will truly understand the message of Soul Mind Body Medicine: I have the power to heal myself. You have the power to heal yourself. Together we have the power to heal the world. Once you use the methods of Soul Mind Body Medicine, you will live this message. Let us now explore its underlying theories. Cell Theory A body consists of many systems, such as the nervous system, the circulatory system, the digestive system, and the immune system. Each system in turn consists of many organs. For example, the digestive system includes the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, liver, and pancreas. Each organ in turn consists of many cells. Scientists estimate that a brain consists of about 15 billion cells. Each cell is made up of various units such as a nucleus, mitochondria, Golgi apparati, and other organelles. The nucleus includes DNA and RNA. Each cell unit has its specific functions and role. The key points of Cell Theory are as follows: A cell is the smallest functioning unit of the body. Cells constantly vibrate, expanding and contracting. This vibration creates an energy field around each cell. Western medicine identifies many causes of illness, including bacteria, viruses, stress, trauma, pollution, and genetic factors. All these factors affect cellular vibration. Traditional Chinese medicine identifies many causes of illness, including natural factors such as wind, cold, summer heat, dampness, dryness, and fire; emotional factors such as anger, overexcitement, worry, sadness, and fear; and accidental factors such as falls, snakebites, and injuries. All these factors affect cellular vibration. Any cause of illness identified by any healing modality affects cellular vibration. When cellular vibration is affected by any factor posited as a cause of illness, two things can happen: 1) The cells become overactive, radiating lots of energy and increasing the density of the energy around the cells. This energy cannot flow quickly enough through the meridians \u2014 the energy pathways, according to traditional Chinese medicine \u2014 to other parts of the body, resulting in an energy blockage. 2) The cells become underactive, radiating little energy. This results in an insufficiency of energy around the cells. An overaccumulation of energy or, simply, too much energy is the root cause of about 85 to 90 percent of all unhealthy conditions. The sicknesses due to too much energy include pain, inflammations, cysts, tumors, cancer, and AIDS, as well as emotional imbalances such as anger, depression, anxiety, worry, grief, and fear. Not enough energy is the root cause of about 10 to 15 percent of sicknesses, including chronic fatigue syndrome and degenerative diseases such as osteoporosis, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease. For sicknesses due to too much energy, the healing solution is to reduce the energy density around the cells. Soul Mind Body Medicine will give you practical tools to dissipate and move excess energy around the cells. For sicknesses due to not enough energy, the healing solution is to increase the energy density around the cells. Soul Mind Body Medicine will also give you practical tools to increase insufficient energy around the cells. In one page, the Cell Theory of Soul Mind Body Medicine explains the causes of illness and the nature of healing. Essentially, the rest of this book will give you specific tools and techniques to accomplish healing, both for yourself and others. I will also take you much deeper, into the spiritual aspects of illness and healing, into the soul of Soul Mind Body Medicine. Field Theory As explained above, a cell constantly vibrates. The energy radiating from the cell's vibration forms a field around the cell. Every cell has its own energy field. Similarly, every organ has its own energy field. The body as a whole has its own energy field, which many people understand as the aura of the body. According to Soul Mind Body Medicine, the energy fields of all the organs in the body radiate to and influence one another. Illness can also result from imbalances in the energy fields around organs. Just as cells can be over- or underactive, so too can organs. The ultimate healing solution for all illness is to balance the energy fields around every organ and every cell, and to bring all fields into relative balance with each other. To summarize: For sicknesses due to too much energy, the healing solution is to dissipate the density of the fields and reduce the pressure around the organs and cells. For sicknesses due to not enough energy, the healing solution is to increase the density and increase the pressure of the fields around the organs and cells. Space Theory There are two kinds of space in the human body. One is the smaller space, the space between the cells. The other is the bigger space, the space between the organs. Eighty-five to 90 percent of sicknesses are due to having too much energy in the space. Ten to 15 percent of sicknesses are due to not having enough energy in the space. Energy radiates out from cellular vibration. The collision of these energies happens in the space, both the smaller and the bigger space. Some energies will join together to increase the original energy. Some will join to create new kinds of energy. All these kinds of energy must flow inside the smaller and bigger space. This is very important. Remember that cleaning the energy in the space and promoting energy flow in the space are vital to healing. This book will give you practical tools to reduce or increase the energy density in the space to balance and heal. Matter Energy Message Theory A cell consists of a membrane, cytoplasm, and a nucleus. It contains liquid, proteins, cell units, DNA, and RNA. Everything inside the cell is matter. When a constantly vibrating cell contracts, matter inside the cell transforms to energy outside the cell, in the space around the cell. When a cell expands, energy outside the cell transforms to matter inside the cell. Under normal conditions, this transformation between matter inside the cell and energy outside the cell is in relative balance. If this balance is lost, however, sickness can occur. In fact, any sickness can be explained as an imbalance in the transformation between matter inside the cell and energy outside the cell. The healing solution is to balance this transformation. Soul Mind Body Medicine gives you practical tools to do this, many of which are based on the Matter Energy Message Theory, which states: Message is soul or spirit. Matter and energy are carriers of message. Message can directly affect the transformation between matter inside the cell and energy outside the cell. Message can affect the transformation between matter and energy because it connects with, directs, and balances both matter and energy. A prayer is a message. Therefore, prayer can affect the transformation between matter and energy, which means that prayer can heal. This wisdom clearly explains how and why prayer works. It really is that simple. A great deal of scientific research, not to mention anecdotal evidence, has demonstrated that prayer works, but scientists haven't been able to explain clearly how. Matter Energy Message Theory explains how prayer works because it makes it clear that message works at the cellular level and at the DNA and RNA level, directly affecting both the matter inside the cells and the energy outside the cells. Message can balance the transformation between matter inside the cells and energy outside the cells. This wisdom reveals the essence of how spiritual healing can work for the physical body, emotional body, and mental body. The Matter Energy Message Theory can explain any cause of "}
