We want our patients to be well-informed about their conditions and treatment decisions. Discussion and education about the root cause of the patient's diagnosis will help to prevent future reoccurrence. [Our goal is a happy and healthy patient.](/contact/) Our office offers many holistic and regenerative treatments to encourage healing from within the body. These treatments don't curtail healing, but rather stimulate the proper cells and collagen to improve. It is widely known that when an injection is administered to a tissue it starts a cascade called the \"needle effect\" or the \"puncture phenomenon\" this instigates stem cells to become active starting the healing cascade. We Utilize Products in Our Office - Homeopathic medicines - Viscosupplementation with Hyaluronic acid - Growth factor injections - Platelet Rich Plasma injections - Acupuncture treatments - Essential oils - Nutritional supplements Homeopatic Medicines Many homeopathic medications have fantastic healing effects on many conditions we treat. One of our favorite homeopathic medications we use is: Traumeel which has been on the market for over 60 years, and has been supported by over 2 dozen studies, showing its safety, efficacy and ability to regulate the inflammatory pathways in order for more efficient healing of tissues.Podiatrists commonly treat musculoskeletal injuries, so the use of homeopathic products in which the body improves and regulates the repair process is very effective. Traumeel is one product that does just that. This medicine comes in three forms; oral, topical and injectable. All three forms may be used together, with no worry of over-dosage, or drug interactions. It is safe for children, and the elderly. The difference in utilizing Traumeel instead of traditional medications, is that Traumeel is an inflammation regulating drug, (IRD) it never shuts the inflammatory system off completely (which is the whole premise in Homeopathic Medicine) it just modulates this system. Traumeel can be used in topical form for any type of strain, or sprain. The product is made up of plants and minerals. All of the ingredients work synergistically to reduce inflammation, to help with the resorption of eccyhmosis and edema, and acts as an analgesic. The topical can be used numerous times per day and can be combined with any other treatment regimen as well. The tablets may be used 2-3 times per day in addition to the cream, or as a stand alone product. The patient needs to know not to expect the \"immediate less pain response\" that comes with traditional NSAID's, so it should be used for many days up to weeks. The injectable can be used on any type of musculoskeletal injury safely. It can be injected into ligament, tendon, joints, capsule, muscle trigger points, or into any subcutaneous tissues surrounding an injury as well. When using a needling approach in the chronic injury, we are stimulating that acute inflammation process Hyaluronic Acid Injections Hyaluronic acid, also known as hyaluronan, is a clear, substance that is naturally produced by your body and is found in our joints which helps keep the cartilage healthy by helping to retain water which keeps the tissues and fluids moist and lubricated. Injections into the joints are available and have been used for over 20 years in the orthopedic community. These injections can be done safely in our office weekly typically 3-5 times. We utilize these injections in a few of the larger foot and ankle joints. Growth Factor Injections These injections contanin growth factors that are very powerful agents that are designed to produce healing by signalling the proper cells to produce collagen to produce skin or cartilage, and or reduce scar tissue. These products contain proteins, growth factors and enzymes that quickly enhance healing. The agents inside the product can be used for chronic tendon injuries, sprains, or damaged cartilage. Platelet Rich Plasma Injections PRP is an injection regime that has been used for many years. It requires the patients own blood spun down to collect the platelets which are rich in growth factors and healing cells, to be re-injected back into the injured tissues; tendon, joint or ligament. Plasma is used from the patient received from a simple blood draw, this part of the fluid has the important cells that promote healing. There are many conditions, and injuries that we treat that can be repaired without the use of cortisone and antiinflammatory drugs. Acupuncture Dr. Schoene has utilized acupuncture in the office for many years. It can supplement her other traditional or holistic treatments. This is a simple but profound way to help reduce many aches and pains associated with acute or chronic injury, to enhance healing, and to encourage the natural flow of energy or \"CHI\" via the neurohormonal pathways in the body. Some believe that utilizing acupuncture stimulates the body's natural pain killers. Essential Oils Essential oils are both exciting and promising when it comes to taking care of your family's and your own health. Whether you're applying essential oils topically, enjoying the aromatic benefits through diffusing, or taking essential oils internally, the positive, healthful effects of essential oils are boundless. That's why you'll want to ensure that the essential oils you are using are capable of delivering on their promise. You'll want to make sure that you are choosing essential oils for their potency and their purity. Potency starts with the plant itself. The same species of plant when grown in different environments will vary in chemical composition. When plants are grown in optimal soil, temperature, and climate, they produce a higher quality essential oil\u2014just as nature intended. But, that's only half of the equation. Purity plays a major role as well. Many essential oils available to purchase are not certified pure. Often, they contain fillers or other elements that dilute and alter the purity. This diminishes the healthful qualities of the oil. What Are Essential Oils? If you have ever enjoyed the scent of a rose, you've experienced the aromatic qualities of essential oils. These naturally occurring, volatile aromatic compounds are found in the seeds, bark, stems, roots, flowers, and other parts of plants. Essential oils provide plants with protection against predators and disease and play a role in plant pollination. In addition to their intrinsic benefits to plants and being beautifully fragrant to people, essential oils have long been used for food preparation, beauty treatment, and health-care practices. How Do I Use Essential Oils? Essential oils are used for a very wide range of emotional and physical wellness applications. They can be used a single oil at a time or in complex blends in one of three methods: Aromatic Certain essential oils, when diffused, can be very stimulating, while others can be calming and soothing. Diffusing essential oils can also purify the air of unwanted odors and some airborne pathogens. Topical Essential oils are easily absorbed by the skin and most can be safely applied. Always read the directions for applying an oil topically. Internal Essential oils can also be used as dietary supplements supporting a variety of healthy conditions. Always read the directions for taking an oil internally.
