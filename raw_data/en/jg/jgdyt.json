Within this context, the APA 2005 Presidential TaskForce on Evidence-Based Practice denes and discussesevidence-based practice in psychology (EBPP). In an in-tegration of science and practice, the Task Force's reportdescribes psychology's fundamental commitment to sophis-ticated EBPP and takes into account the full range ofevidence psychologists and policymakers must consider.Research, clinical expertise, and patient characteristics areall supported as relevant to good outcomes. EBPP pro-motes effective psychological practice and enhances publichealth by applying empirically supported principles of psy-chological assessment, case formulation, therapeutic rela-tionship, and intervention. The report provides a rationalefor and expanded discussion of the EBPP policy statementthat was developed by the Task Force and adopted asassociation policy by the APA Council of Representativesin August 2005. Keywords: evidence-based practice; best available research evidence; clinical expertise; patient characteristics, culture,and preferences From the very rst conceptions of applied psychology as articulated by Lightner Witmer, who formed therst psychological clinic in 1896 (McReynolds, 1997), psychologists have been deeply and uniquely asso-ciated with an evidence-based approach to patient care. AsWitmer (1907/1996) pointed out, \"the pure and the appliedsciences advance in a single front. What retards theprogress of one, retards the progress of the other; whatfosters one, fosters the other\" (p. 249). As early as 1947,the idea that doctoral psychologists should be trained asboth scientists and practitioners became American Psycho-logical Association (APA) policy (Shakow et al., 1947).Early practitioners such as Frederick C. Thorne (1947)articulated the methods by which psychological practitio-ners integrate science into their practice by \"increasingapplication of the experimental approach to the individualcase and to the clinician's own 'experience'\" (p. 159).Thus, psychologists have been on the forefront of thedevelopment of evidence-based practice for decades. Evidence-based practice in psychology is therefore consistent with the past 20 years of work in evidence-basedmedicine, which advocated for improved patient outcomesby informing clinical practice with relevant research (Sox& Woolf, 1993; Woolf & Atkins, 2001). Sackett, Richardson (1996) describedevidence-based medicine as \"the conscientious, explicit,and judicious use of current best evidence in making deci-sions about the care of individual patients\" (pp. 71-72). The use and misuse of evidence-based principles in thepractice of health care has affected the dissemination ofhealth care funds, but not always to the benet of thepatient. Therefore, psychologists, whose training isgrounded in empirical methods, have an important role toplay in the continuing development of evidence-basedpractice and its focus on improving patient care. One approach to implementing evidence-based prac- tice in health care systems has been through the develop-ment of guidelines for best practice. During the early partof the evidence-based practice movement, APA recognizedthe importance of a comprehensive approach to the con-ceptualization of guidelines. APA also recognized the risk that guidelines might be used inappropriately by commer-cial health care organizations not intimately familiar withthe scientic basis of practice to dictate specic forms oftreatment and restrict patient access to care. In 1992, APAformed a joint task force of the Board of Scientic Affairs,the Board of Professional Affairs, and the Committee for The Task Force members were Carol D.

The document developed by this task force\u2014the Template for Developing Guidelines: Interventions for Mental Disorders and Psy-chosocial Aspects of Physical Disorders (hereinafter, Tem- plate )\u2014was approved by the APA Council of Representa- tives in 1995 (American Psychological Association, 1995).The Template described the variety of evidence that shouldbe considered in developing guidelines, and it cautionedthat any emerging clinical practice guidelines should bebased on careful systematic weighing of research data andclinical expertise. The Template noted that the successful construction of guidelines relies on the availability of adequate scientic and clinical evidence concerning the inter-vention being applied and the diagnostic condition beingtreated .... Panels (should) weigh the available evidence accord- ing to accepted standards of scientic merit, recognizing that thewarrant for conclusions differs widely for different bodies of data.(p. 2) Both the Template and the subsequent revised policy document that replaced it\u2014the Criteria for EvaluatingTreatment Guidelines (American Psychological Associa-tion, 2002)\u2014were quite specic in indicating that the ev-idence base for any psychological intervention should beevaluated in terms of two separate dimensions: efcacy and clinical utility . The dimension of efcacy lays out criteria for the evaluation of the strength of evidence pertaining toestablishing causal relationships between interventions anddisorders under treatment. The clinical utility dimensionincludes a consideration of available research evidence andclinical consensus regarding the generalizability, feasibility(including patient acceptability), and costs and benets ofinterventions. The Template was used to examine a selection of available mental health treatment guidelines, and widevariation was found in the quality of the guidelines' cov-erage of the relevant literature as well as the scientic andclinical basis, specicity, and generalizability of their treat-ment recommendations (Stricker et al., 1999). Even guide-lines that were clearly designed to educate rather than tolegislate, were interdisciplinary in nature, and providedextensive empirical and clinical information did not alwaysaccurately translate the evidence reviewed into the algo-rithms that determined the protocols for treatment underparticular sets of circumstances. Psychologists have beenparticularly concerned about widely disseminated practiceguidelines that recommend the use of medications overpsychological interventions in the absence of data support-ing such recommendations 1996; Beutler, 1998;Munoz, Hollon, VandenBos, 1994; Nathan, The general benets of psychotherapy had been es- tablished by meta-analytic reviews during the 1970s (Smith& Glass, 1977; Smith, Glass, & Miller, 1980). Neverthe-less, a perception existed in many corners of the healthdelivery system that psychological treatments for particulardisorders were either ineffective or inferior to pharmaco-logical treatment. In 1995, the APA Division 12 (ClinicalPsychology) Task Force on Promotion and Disseminationof Psychological Procedures, in an effort to promote treat- ments delivered by psychologists, published criteria foridentifying empirically validated treatments (subsequentlyrelabeled empirically supported treatments ) for particular disorders (Chambless et al., 1996, 1998). This task forceidentied 18 treatments whose empirical support they con-sidered to be well established on the basis of criteria thatincluded having been tested in randomized controlled trials(RCTs) with a specic population and implemented usinga treatment manual. Although the goal was to identify treatments with evidence for efcacy comparable to the evidence for theefcacy of medications\u2014and, hence, to highlight the con-tribution of psychological treatments\u2014the Division 12Task Force report sparked a decade of both enthusiasm andcontroversy. The report increased recognition of demon-strably effective psychological treatments among the pub-lic, policymakers, and training programs. At the same time,many psychologists raised concerns about the exclusivefocus on brief, manualized treatments; the emphasis onspecic treatment effects as opposed to common factorsthat account for much of the variance in outcomes acrossdisorders; and the applicability to a diverse range of pa-tients varying in comorbidity, personality, race, ethnicity,and culture. In response, several groups of psychologists, includ- ing other divisions of APA, offered additional frameworksfor integrating the available research evidence. In 1999,APA Division 29 (Psychotherapy) established a task forceto identify, operationalize, and disseminate information onempirically supported therapy relationships, given the pow-erful association between outcome and aspects of the ther-apeutic relationship such as the therapeutic alliance(Norcross, 2001). APA Division 17 (Society of CounselingPsychology) also undertook an examination of empiricallysupported treatments in counseling psychology (Wampold,Lichtenberg, & Waehler, 2002). The Society of BehavioralMedicine, which is not a part of APA but has a signicantlyoverlapping membership, has recently published criteriafor examining the evidence base for behavioral medicineinterventions (Davidson, Trudeau, Ockene, Orleans, &Kaplan, 2003). As of this writing, we are aware that taskforces have been appointed to examine related issues by alarge number of APA divisions concerned with practiceissues. At the same time that these groups within psychology have been grappling with how best to conceptualize andexamine the scientic basis for practice, the evidence-based practice movement has become a key feature ofhealth care systems and health care policy. At the statelevel, a number of initiatives encourage or mandate the useof a specic list of mental health treatments within stateMedicaid programs (e.g., Carpinello, Rosenberg, Stone,Schwager, & Tanenbaum, 2005). At the federallevel, a major joint initiative of the National Institute ofMental Health and the Department of Health and HumanService's Substance Abuse and Mental Health ServicesAdministration focuses on promoting, implementing, and 272 May-June 2006 American Psychologistevaluating evidence-based mental health practices within state mental health systems (e.g., see National Institutes ofHealth, 2004). The goals of evidence-based practice initi-atives to improve quality and cost-effectiveness and toenhance accountability are laudable and broadly supportedwithin psychology, although empirical evidence of system-wide improvements following their implementation is stilllimited. However, the psychological community\u2014includ-ing both scientists and practitioners\u2014is concerned thatevidence-based practice initiatives not be misused as ajustication for inappropriately restricting access to careand choice of treatments. It was in this context that 2005 APA President Ronald F. Levant appointed the APA Presidential Task Force onEvidence-Based Practice (hereinafter, Task Force ). The Task Force included scientists and practitioners from awide range of perspectives and traditions, reflecting thediverse perspectives within the eld. In this report, the TaskForce hopes to draw on APA's century-long tradition ofattention to the integration of science and practice bycreating a document that describes psychology's funda-mental commitment to sophisticated evidence-based psy-chological practice and takes into account the full range ofevidence that policymakers must consider. We aspire to setthe stage for further development and renement of evi-dence-based practice for the betterment of psychologicalaspects of health care as it is delivered around the world. 1 Definition On the basis of its review of the literature and its deliber-ations, the Task Force agreed on the following denition:Evidence-based practice in psychology (EBPP) is the inte- gration of the best available research with clinical expertisein the context of patient characteristics, culture, andpreferences. This denition of EBPP closely parallels the denition of evidence-based practice adopted by the Institute of Med-icine \"Evidence-based practice isthe integration best research evidence with clinical ex-pertise and patient values\" (p. 147). Psychology builds onthe Institute of Medicine denition by deepening the ex-amination of clinical expertise and broadening the consid-eration of patient characteristics. The purpose of EBPP is topromote effective psychological practice and enhance pub-lic health by applying empirically supported principles ofpsychological assessment, case formulation, therapeutic re-lationship, and intervention. Psychological practice entails many types of interven- tions, in multiple settings, for a wide variety of potentialpatients. In this document, intervention refers to all direct services rendered by health care psychologists, includingassessment, diagnosis, prevention, treatment, psychother-apy, and consultation. As is the case with most discussionsof evidence-based practice, we focus on treatment. Thesame general principles apply to psychological assessment,which is essential to effective treatment. The settings in- clude but are not limited to hospitals, clinics, independentpractices, schools, military installations, public health in-stitutions, rehabilitation institutes, primary care centers, counseling centers, and nursing homes. To be consistent with discussions of evidence-based practice in other areas of health care, we use the termpatient in this document to refer to the child, adolescent, adult, older adult, couple, family, group, organization,community, or other population receiving psychologicalservices. However, we recognize that in many situationsthere are important and valid reasons for using such termsasclient ,consumer ,o r person in place of patient to de- scribe the recipient of services. Further, psychologists tar-get a variety of problems, including but not restricted tomental health, academic, vocational, relational, health,community, and other problems in their professionalpractices. It is important to clarify the relation between EBPP and empirically supported treatments (ESTs). EBPP is themore comprehensive concept. ESTs start with a treatmentand ask whether it works for a certain disorder or problemunder specied circumstances. EBPP starts with the patientand asks what research evidence (including relevant resultsfrom RCTs) will assist the psychologist in achieving thebest outcome. In addition, ESTs are specic psychologicaltreatments that have been shown to be efcacious in con-trolled clinical trials, whereas EBPP encompasses abroader range of clinical activities (e.g., psychological as-sessment, case formulation, therapy relationships). Assuch, EBPP articulates a decision-making process for inte-grating multiple streams of research evidence\u2014includingbut not limited to RCTs\u2014into the intervention process. The following sections explore in greater detail the three major components of this denition\u2014 best availableresearch, clinical expertise, and patient characteristics\u2014and their integration. Best Available Research Evidence A sizable body of scientic evidence drawn from a varietyof research designs and methodologies attests to the effec- 1The Task Force limited its consideration to evidence-based practice as it relates to health services provided by psychologists. Therefore, otherorganizational, community, or educational applications of evidence-basedpractice by psychologists are outside the scope of this report. Further, theTask Force was charged with dening and explicating principles ofevidence-based practice in psychology but not with developing practiceguidelines for individual psychologists or with other forms ofimplementation. In its rst two meetings, through an iterative process of small working groups and subsequent review and revision of all drafts by theentire group, the Task Force achieved consensus in support of draftversions of its two primary work products: a draft APA policy statementand a draft report. The draft documents were circulated widely, with arequest for review and comment to the APA Council of Representatives,boards and committees, divisions, and state and provincial psychologicalassociations. Notice of the documents' availability for review and com-ment by members was published in the APA Monitor on Psychology and publicized on the front page of the APA Web site. A total of 199 sets ofcomments were submitted by groups and by individual members. Each ofthese comments was reviewed and discussed by the Task Force in a seriesof conference calls. At its nal meeting, the Task Force achieved consen-sus on revised versions of the proposed APA policy statement and thecurrent report. 273 May-June 2006 American Psychologisttiveness of psychological practices. The research literature on the effect of psychological interventions indicates thatthese interventions are safe and effective for a large numberof children and youths (Kazdin & Weisz, 2003; (Duffy, 1999; & Knight,1996) across a wide range of psychological, addictive,health, and relational problems. More recent research hasindicated that compared with alternative approaches, suchas medications, psychological treatments are particularlyenduring (Hollon, Stewart, & Strunk, 2006). Further, re-search has demonstrated that psychotherapy can and oftendoes pay for itself in terms of medical-cost offset, increasedproductivity, and life satisfaction (Chiles, Lambert, &Hatch, 2002; Yates, 1994). Psychologists possess distinctive strengths in design- ing, conducting, and interpreting research studies that canguide evidence-based practice. Moreover, psychology\u2014asa science and as a profession\u2014is distinctive in combiningscientic commitment with an emphasis on human rela-tionships and individual differences. As such, psychologycan help to develop, broaden, and improve the researchbase for evidence-based practice. There is broad consensus that psychological practice needs to be based on evidence and that research needs tobalance internal and external validity. Research will notalways address all practice needs. Major issues in integrat-ing research in day-to-day practice include (a) the relativeweight to place on different research methods; (b) therepresentativeness of research samples; (c) whether re-search results should guide practice at the level of princi-ples of change, intervention strategies, or specic proto-cols; (d) the generalizability and transportability oftreatments supported in controlled research to clinical prac-tice settings; (e) the extent to which judgments can be madeabout treatments of choice when the number and durationof treatments tested has been limited; and (f) the degree towhich the results of efcacy and effectiveness research canbe generalized from primarily White samples to minorityand marginalized populations (see Westen, Novotny, &Thompson-Brenner, 2004; see positionpapers in Norcross, Beutler, & Levant, 2005). Neverthe-less, research on practice has made progress in investigat-ing these issues and is providing evidence that is moreresponsive to day-to-day practice. There is sufcient con-sensus to move forward with the principles of EBPP. Meta-analytic investigations since the 1970s have shown that most therapeutic practices in widespread clini-cal use are generally effective for treating a range ofproblems (Lambert & Ogles, 2004; Wampold, 2001). Infact, the effect sizes of psychological interventions forchildren, adults, and older adults rival or exceed those ofwidely accepted medical treatments (Barlow, 2004; Lipsey& Wilson, 2001; Rosenthal, 1990; Weisz, Jensen, &McLeod, 2005). It is important not to assume that inter-ventions that have not yet been studied in controlled trialsare ineffective. Specic interventions that have not beensubjected to systematic empirical testing for specic prob-lems cannot be assumed to be either effective or ineffec- tive; they are simply untested to date. Nonetheless, goodpractice and science call for the timely testing of psycho-logical practices in a way that adequately operationalizesthem using appropriate scientic methodology. Widelyused psychological practices as well as innovations devel-oped in the eld or laboratory should be rigorously evalu-ated, and barriers to conducting this research should beidentied and addressed. Multiple Types of Research Evidence Best research evidence refers to scientic results related to intervention strategies, assessment, clinical problems, andpatient populations in laboratory and eld settings as wellas to clinically relevant results of basic research in psy-chology and related elds. APA endorses multiple cost- benet, epidemiological, treatment utiliza-tion) that contribute to effective psychological practice. Multiple research designs contribute to evidence- based practice, and different research designs are bettersuited to address different types of questions (Greenberg &Newman, 1996): Clinical observation (including individual case studies) and basic psychological science are valu-able sources of innovations and hypotheses (thecontext of scientic discovery). Qualitative research can be used to describe the subjective, lived experiences of people, includingparticipants in psychotherapy. Systematic case studies are particularly useful when aggregated\u2014as in the form of practice researchnetworks\u2014for comparing individual patients withothers with similar characteristics. Single-case experimental designs are particularly useful for establishing causal relationships in thecontext of an individual. Public health and ethnographic research are espe- cially useful for tracking the availability, utilization,and acceptance of mental health treatments as wellas suggesting ways of altering these treatments tomaximize their utility in a given social context. Process- outcome studies are especially valuable for identifying mechanisms of change. Studies of interventions as these are delivered in naturalistic settings (effectiveness research) are wellsuited for assessing the ecological validity oftreatments. RCTs and their logical equivalents (efcacy re- search) are the standard for drawing causal infer-ences about the effects of interventions (context ofscientic verication). Meta-analysis is a systematic means to synthesize results from multiple studies, test hypotheses, andquantitatively estimate the size of effects. With respect to evaluating research on specic interven- tions, current APA policy identies two widely accepted 274 May-June 2006 American Psychologistdimensions. As stated in the Criteria for Evaluating Treat- ment Guidelines (American Psychological Association,2002), The rst dimension is treatment efcacy , the systematic and scientic evaluation of whether a treatment works. The seconddimension is clinical utility , the applicability, feasibility, and usefulness of the intervention in the local or specic setting whereit is to be offered. This dimension also includes determination ofthe generalizability of an intervention whose efcacy has beenestablished. (p. 1053) Types of research evidence with regard to intervention research in ascending order as to their contribution toconclusions about efcacy include \"clinical opinion, ob-servation, and consensus among recognized experts repre-senting the range of use in the eld\" (Criterion 2.1); \"sys-tematized clinical observation\" (Criterion 2.2); experiments ortheir logical equivalents\" (Criterion 2.3; Psycho-logical 2002, p. 1054). Among sophisticatedempirical methodologies, \"randomized controlled experi-ments represent a more stringent way to evaluate treatmentefcacy because they are the most effective way to rule outthreats to internal validity in a single experiment\" (Amer-ican Psychological Association, 2002, p. 1054). Evidence on clinical utility is also crucial. Per estab- lished APA policy (American Psychological Association,2002), at a minimum this includes attention to generality ofeffects across varying and diverse patients, therapists, set-tings, and the interaction of these factors; the robustness oftreatments across various modes of delivery; the feasibilitywith which treatments can be delivered to patients in real-world settings; and the costs associated with treatments. Evidence-based practice requires that psychologists rec- ognize the strengths and limitations of evidence obtained fromdifferent types of research. Research has shown that the treat-ment method (Nathan & Gorman, 2002), the individual psy-chologist (Wampold, 2001), the treatment relationship(Norcross, 2002), and the patient (Bohart & Tallman, 1999)are all vital contributors to the success of psychological prac-tice. Comprehensive evidence-based practice will consider allof these determinants and their optimal combinations. Psy-chological practice is a complex relational and technical en-terprise that requires clinical and research attention to multi-ple, interacting sources of treatment effectiveness. Thereremain many disorders, problem constellations, and clinicalsituations for which empirical data are sparse. In such in-stances, clinicians use their best clinical judgment and knowl-edge of the best available research evidence to develop co-herent treatment strategies. Researchers and practitionersshould join together to ensure that the research available onpsychological practice is both clinically relevant and inter-nally valid. Future Directions EBPP has important implications for research programs and funding priorities. These programs and prioritiesshould emphasize research on the following:psychological treatments of established efcacy in combination with\u2014and as an to\u2014phar-macological treatments; the and transportability controlled researchsettings; Patient/H11003Treatment (moderators); the efcacy and effectiveness of psychological prac- tice with underrepresented groups, such as those char-acterized by gender, gender identity, ethnicity, race,social class, disability status, and sexual orientation; the efcacy and effectiveness of psychological treatments with children and youths at differentdevelopmental stages; the efcacy and effectiveness of psychological treatments with older adults; distinguishing common and specic factors as mechanisms of change; characteristics and actions of the psychologist and the therapeutic relationship that contribute to posi-tive outcomes; the effectiveness of widely practiced treatments\u2014 based on various theoretical orientations and inte-grative blends\u2014that have not yet been subjected tocontrolled research; the development of models of treatment based on identication and observation of the practices ofclinicians in the community who empirically obtainthe most positive outcomes; criteria for discontinuing treatment; accessibility and utilization of psychological the cost-effectiveness and costs- benets of psycho- logical interventions; development and testing of practice research networks; the effects of feedback regarding treatment progress to the psychologist or patient; development of profession-wide consensus, rooted in the best available research evidence, on psychologicaltreatments that are considered discredited; and research on prevention of psychological disorders and risk behaviors. Clinical Expertise Clinical expertise2is essential for identifying and integrat- ing the best research evidence with clinical data (e.g.,information about the patient obtained over the course oftreatment) in the context of the patient's characteristics andpreferences to deliver services that have the highest prob-ability of achieving the goals of therapy. Psychologists aretrained as scientists as well as practitioners. An advantageof psychological training is that it fosters a clinical exper- 2As it is used in this report, clinical expertise refers to competence attained by psychologists through education, training, and experience thatresults in effective practice; the term is not meant to refer to extraordinaryperformance that might characterize an elite group (e.g., the top 2%) ofclinicians. 275 May-June 2006 American Psychologisttise informed by scientic expertise, allowing the psychol- ogist to understand and integrate scientic literature as wellas to frame and test hypotheses and interventions in prac-tice as a \"local clinical scientist\" (Stricker & Trierweiler,1995). Cognitive scientists have found consistent evidence of enduring and signicant differences between experts andnovices undertaking complex tasks in several domains (Be \u00b4- dard & Chi, 1992; Bransford, Brown, & Cocking, 1999;Gambrill, 2005). Experts recognize meaningful patternsand disregard irrelevant information, acquire extensiveknowledge and organize it in ways that reflect a deepunderstanding of their domain, organize their knowledgeusing functional rather than descriptive features, retrieveknowledge relevant to the task at hand fluidly and auto-matically, adapt to new situations, self-monitor theirknowledge and performance, know when their knowledgeis inadequate, continue to learn, and generally attain out-comes commensurate with their expertise. However, experts are not infallible. All humans are prone to errors and biases. Some of these stem from cog-nitive strategies and heuristics that are generally adaptiveand efcient. Others stem from emotional reactions, whichgenerally guide adaptive behavior as well but can also leadto biased or motivated reasoning (e.g., Ditto & Lopez,1992; Ditto, Munro, Apanovitch, Scepansky, & Lockhart,2003; Kunda, 1990). Whenever psychologists involved inresearch or practice move from observations to inferencesand generalizations, there are inherent risks of idiosyncraticinterpretations, overgeneralizations, conrmatory biases,and similar Westen & Weinberger, 2004). Integral to clinicalexpertise is an awareness of the limits of one's knowledgeand skills and attention to the heuristics and biases\u2014 bothcognitive and affective\u2014that can affect clinical judgment.Mechanisms such as consultation and systematic feedbackfrom the patient can mitigate some of these biases. The individual therapist has a substantial impact on outcomes, both in clinical trials and in practice settings(Crits-Christoph et al., 1991; Huppert et al., 2001; Kim,Wampold, & Bolt, in press; Wampold & Brown, 2005).The fact that treatment outcomes are systematically relatedto the provider of the treatment (above and beyond the typeof treatment) provides strong evidence for the importanceof understanding expertise in clinical practice as a way ofenhancing patient outcomes. Components of Clinical Expertise Clinical expertise encompasses a number of competencies that promote positive therapeutic outcomes. These include(a) assessment, diagnostic judgment, systematic case for-mulation, and treatment planning; (b) clinical decisionmaking, treatment implementation, and monitoring of pa-tient progress; (c) interpersonal expertise; (d) continualself-reflection and acquisition of skills; (e) appropriateevaluation and use of research evidence in both basic andapplied psychological science; (f) understanding the influ-ence of individual and cultural differences on treatment; (g)seeking available resources (e.g., consultation, adjunctive or alternative services) as needed; and (h) having a cogentrationale for clinical strategies. Expertise develops fromclinical and scientic training, theoretical understanding,experience, self-reflection, knowledge of research, andcontinuing professional education and training. It is mani-fested in all clinical activities, including but not limited toforming therapeutic alliances; assessing patients and devel-oping systematic case formulations, planning treatment,and setting goals; selecting interventions and applyingthem skillfully; monitoring patient progress and adjustingpractices accordingly; attending to patients' individual, so-cial, and cultural contexts; and seeking available resourcesas needed (e.g., consultation, adjunctive or alternativeservices). Assessment, diagnostic judgment, system- atic case formulation, and treatment planning.The clinically expert psychologist is able to formulate clearand theoretically coherent case conceptualizations, assesspatient pathology as well as clinically relevant strengths,understand complex patient presentations, and make accu-rate diagnostic judgments. Expert clinicians revise theircase conceptualizations as treatment proceeds and seekboth conrming and disconrming evidence. Clinical ex-pertise also involves identifying and helping patients toacknowledge psychological processes that contribute todistress or dysfunction. Treatment planning involves setting goals and tasks of treatment that take into consideration the unique patient,the nature of the patient's problems and concerns, the likelyprognosis and expected benets of treatment, and availableresources. The goals of therapy are developed in collabo-ration with the patient and consider the patient and his orher family's worldview and sociocultural context. Thechoice of treatment strategies requires knowledge of inter-ventions and the research that supports their effectivenessas well as research relevant to matching interventions topatients (e.g., Alomohamed, also requires knowledge about psychopathology;treatment process; and patient attitudes, values, and con-text\u2014including cultural context\u2014that can affect the choiceand implementation of effective treatment strategies. Clinical decision making, treatment imple- mentation, and monitoring of patient progress.Clinical expertise entails the skillful and flexible deliveryof treatment. Skill and flexibility require knowledge of andprociency in delivering psychological interventions andthe ability to adapt the treatment to the particular case.Flexibility is manifested in tact, timing, pacing, and fram-ing of interventions; maintaining an effective balance be-tween consistency of interventions and responsiveness topatient feedback; and attention to acknowledged and unac-knowledged meanings, beliefs, and emotions. Clinical expertise also entails the monitoring of pa- tient progress (and of changes in the patient's circum-stances\u2014 e.g., job loss, major illness) that may suggest theneed to adjust the treatment (Lambert, Bergin, & Gareld,2004). If progress is not proceeding adequately, the psy- 276 May-June 2006 American Psychologistchologist alters or addresses problematic aspects of the treatment (e.g., problems in the therapeutic relationship orin the implementation of the goals of the treatment) asappropriate. If insufcient progress remains a problem, thetherapist considers alternative diagnoses and formulations,consultation, supervision, or referral. The clinical expertmakes decisions about termination in timely ways by as-sessing patient progress in the context of the patient's life,treatment goals, resources, and relapse potential. Interpersonal expertise. Central to clinical expertise is interpersonal skill, which is manifested informing a therapeutic relationship, encoding and decodingverbal and nonverbal responses, creating realistic but pos-itive expectations, and responding empathically to the pa-tient's explicit and implicit experiences and concerns. In-terpersonal expertise involves the flexibility to be clinicallyeffective with patients of diverse backgrounds. Interperson-ally skilled psychologists are able to challenge patients in asupportive atmosphere that fosters exploration, openness,and change. Psychological practice is, at root, an interpersonal relationship between psychologist and patient. Each partic-ipant in the treatment relationship exerts influence on itsprocess and outcome, and the compatibility of psychologistand patient(s) is particularly important. Converging sourcesof evidence indicate that individual health care profession-als affect the efcacy of treatment (American Psychologi-cal Association, 2002). In psychotherapy, for example,individual-therapist effects (within treatment) account for5%- 8% of the outcome variance (Crits-Christoph et al.,1991; al., in press; Project MATCH ResearchGroup, 1998; Wampold & Brown, 2005). Decades of re-search also support the contribution of an active and mo-tivated patient to successful treatment (e.g., Bohart & Tall-man, 1999; Clarkin & Levy, 2004; W. R. Miller &Rollnick, 2002; Prochaska, Norcross, & DiClemente, 1994). With the development interactive electronic tech- nology (e.g., telehealth), many community-wide psycho-logical interventions or other approaches do not necessarilyinvolve direct, face-to-face contact with a psychologist.However, these interventions, to be effective, also engagethe patient actively in the treatment process and attend in aflexible manner to individual variations among targetedgroups. The clinical expert fosters the patient's positive en- gagement in the therapeutic process, monitors the thera-peutic alliance, and attends carefully to barriers to engage-ment and change. The clinical expert recognizes barriers toprogress and addresses them in a way that is consistent withtheory and research (e.g., exploring therapeutic impasseswith the patient, addressing problems in the therapeuticrelationship). Continual self-reflection and acquisition of skills. Clinical expertise requires the ability to reflect on one's own experience, knowledge, hypotheses, inferences,emotional reactions, and behaviors and to use that reflec-tion to modify one's practices accordingly. Integral toclinical expertise is an awareness of the limits of one'sknowledge and skills as well as a recognition of the heu-ristics and biases (both cognitive and affective) that can affect clinical judgment (e.g., biases that can inhibit recog-nition of the need to alter case conceptualizations that areinaccurate or treatment strategies that are not working).Clinical expertise involves taking explicit action to limitthe effects of these biases. Developing and maintaining clinical expertise and applying this expertise to specic patients entail the con-tinual incorporation of new knowledge and skills derivedfrom (a) research and theory; (b) systematic clinical obser-vation, disciplined inquiry, and hypothesis testing; (c) self-reflection and feedback from other sources (e.g., supervi-sors, peers, patients, other health professionals, thepatient's signicant others [where appropriate]); (d) mon-itoring of patient outcomes; and (e) continuing educationand other learning opportunities (e.g., practice networks,patient advocacy groups). Evaluation and use of research evidence. Clinical expertise in psychology includes scientic exper-tise. This is one of the hallmarks of psychological educa-tion and one of the advantages of psychological training.An understanding of scientic method allows psycholo-gists to consider evidence from a range of research designs,evaluate the internal and external validity of individualstudies, evaluate the magnitude of effects across studies,and apply relevant research to individual cases. Clinicalexpertise also comprises a scientic attitude toward clinicalwork, characterized by openness to data, clinical hypothe-sis generation and testing, and a capacity to use theory toguide interventions without allowing theoretical precon-ceptions to override clinical or research data. Understanding the influence of individual, cultural, and contextual differences on treat-ment. Clinical expertise requires an awareness of the individual, social, and cultural context of the patient, in-cluding but not limited to age and development, ethnicity,culture, race, gender, sexual orientation, religious commit-ments, and socioeconomic status (see the Patient Charac-teristics, Culture, and Preferences section). Clinical exper-tise allows psychologists to adapt interventions andconstruct a therapeutic milieu that respects the patient'sworldview, values, preferences, capacities, and other char-acteristics (Arnkoff, Glass, & Shapiro, 2002; Sue & Lam,2002). APA has adopted practice guidelines on multicul-tural practice, sexual orientation, and older adults to assistpsychologists in tailoring their practices to patient differ-ences (American Psychological Association, 2000, 2003,2004). Seeking available resources as needed (e.g., consultation, adjunctive or alternativeservices). The psychologist is cognizant that accessing additional resources can sometimes enhance the effective-ness of treatment. When research evidence indicates thevalue of adjunctive services or when patients are not mak-ing progress as expected, the psychologist may seek con-sultation or make a referral. Culturally sensitive alternativeservices responsive to a patient's context or worldview may complement psychological treatment. Consultation for the 277 May-June 2006 American Psychologistpsychologist is a means to monitor\u2014and correct, if neces- sary\u2014 cognitive and affective biases. A cogent rationale for clinical strategies. Clinical expertise requires a planful approach to the treat-ment of psychological problems. Although clinical practiceis often eclectic or integrative (Norcross & Goldfried,2005), and many effects of psychological treatment reflectnonspecic aspects of therapeutic engagement (e.g.,changes that occur through development of an empathicrelationship; Lambert et al., 2004; Weinberger, 1995), psy-chologists rely on well-articulated case formulations,knowledge of relevant research, and the organization pro-vided by theoretical conceptualizations and clinical expe-rience to craft interventions designed to attain desiredoutcomes. Some patients have a well-dened issue or disorder for which there is a body of evidence that strongly supports the effectiveness of a particular treatment. This evidenceshould be considered in formulating a treatment plan, anda cogent rationale should be articulated for any course oftreatment recommended. There are many problem constel-lations, patient populations, and clinical situations forwhich treatment evidence is sparse. In such instances,evidence-based practice consists of using clinical expertisein interpreting and applying the best available evidencewhile carefully monitoring patient progress and modifyingtreatment as appropriate (Hayes, Barlow, & Nelson-Gray,1999; Lambert, Harmon, Slade, Whipple, & Hawkins,2005; S. D. Miller, Duncan, & Hubble, 2005). Future Directions Although much less research is available on clinical exper- tise than on psychological interventions, an important foun-dation is emerging (Goodheart, 2006; Skovholt & Jennings,2004; Westen & Weinberger, 2004). For example, researchon case formulation and diagnosis suggests that clinicalinferences, diagnostic judgments, and formulations can bereliable and valid when structured in ways that maximizeclinical Lombart, 2005).Research suggests that sensitivity and flexibility in theadministration of therapeutic interventions produces betteroutcomes than rigid application of manuals or principles(Castonguay, Goldfried, Wiser, Raue, & Hayes, 1996;Henry, Schacht, Strupp, Butler, & Binder, 1993; Huppert etal., 2001). Reviews of research on biases and heuristics inclinical judgment have suggested procedures that cliniciansmight use to minimize those biases (Garb, 1998). Becauseof the importance of therapeutic alliance to outcome (Hor-vath & Bedi, 2002; Martin, Garske, & Davis, 2000; Shirk& Karver, 2003), an understanding of the personal at-tributes and interventions of therapists that strengthen thealliance is essential for maximizing the quality of patientcare (Ackerman & Hilsenroth, 2003). Mutually respectful collaboration between researchers and expert practitioners will foster useful and systematicempirical investigation of clinical expertise. Some of themost pressing research needs are the following:studying the practices of clinicians who obtain the best outcomes in the community, both in generaland with particular kinds of patients or problems; identifying technical skills used by expert clinicians in the administration of psychological interventionsthat have proven to be effective; improving the reliability, validity, and clinical util- ity of diagnoses and case formulations; studying conditions that maximize clinical expertise (rather than focusing primarily on limits to clinicalexpertise); determining the extent to which errors and biases widely studied in the literature are linked to decre-ments in treatment outcome and how to modify orcorrect those errors; developing well-normed measures that clinicians can use to quantify their diagnostic judgments, mea-sure therapeutic progress over time, and assess thetherapeutic process; distinguishing expertise related to common factors shared across most therapies and expertise specicto particular treatment approaches; and providing clinicians with real-time patient feedback to benchmark progress in treatment and clinicalsupport tools to adjust treatment as needed. Patient Characteristics, Culture, and Preferences Normative data on \"what works for whom\" (Nathan & Gorman, 2002; Roth & Fonagy, 2004) provide essentialguides to effective practice. Nevertheless, psychologicalservices are most likely to be effective when they areresponsive to the patient's specic problems, strengths,personality, sociocultural context, and preferences(Norcross, 2002). Psychology's long history of studyingindividual differences and developmental change, and itsgrowing empirical literature related to human diversity(including culture 3and psychotherapy), place it in a strong position to identify effective ways of integrating researchand clinical expertise with an understanding of patientcharacteristics essential to EBPP (Hall, 2001; Sue, Zane, &Young, 1994). EBPP involves consideration of the pa-tient's values, religious beliefs, worldviews, goals, andpreferences for treatment with the psychologist's experi-ence and understanding of the available research. Several questions frame current debates about the role of patient characteristics in EBPP. The rst regards theextent to which cross-diagnostic patient characteristics,such as personality traits or constellations, moderate theimpact of empirically tested interventions. A second, re- 3Culture , in this context, is understood to encompass a broad array of phenomena (e.g., shared values, history, knowledge, rituals, customs) thatoften result in a shared sense of identity. Racial and ethnic groups mayhave a shared culture, but those personal characteristics are not the onlycharacteristics that dene cultural groups (e.g., deaf culture, inner-cityculture). Culture is a multifaceted construct, and cultural factors cannot beunderstood in isolation from social, class, and personal characteristics thatmake each patient unique. 278 May-June 2006 American Psychologistlated question concerns the extent to which social factors and cultural differences necessitate different forms of treat-ment or, conversely, the extent to which interventionswidely tested in majority populations can be readilyadapted for patients with different ethnic or socioculturalbackgrounds. A third question concerns maximizing theextent to which widely used interventions adequately at-tend to developmental considerations, both for children andadolescents (Weisz & Hawley, 2002) and for older adults(Zarit & Knight, 1996). A fourth question concerns theextent to which variable clinical presentations, such ascomorbidity and polysymptomatic presentations, moderatethe impact of interventions. Underlying all of these ques-tions is the issue of how best to approach the treatment ofpatients whose characteristics (e.g., gender, gender iden-tity, ethnicity, race, social class, disability status, sexualorientation) and problems (e.g., comorbidity) may differfrom those of samples studied in research. This is a matterof active discussion in the eld, and there is increasingresearch attention to the generalizability and transportabil-ity of psychological interventions. Available data indicate that a variety of patient-related variables influence outcomes, many of which are cross-diagnostic characteristics such as functional status, readi-ness to change, and level of social support (Norcross,2002). Other patient characteristics are essential to considerin forming and maintaining a treatment relationship and inimplementing specic interventions. These include but arenot limited to (a) variations in presenting problems ordisorders, etiology, concurrent symptoms or syndromes,and behavior; (b) chronological age, developmental status,developmental history, and life stage; (c) sociocultural andfamilial factors (e.g., gender, gender identity, ethnicity,race, social class, religion, disability status, family struc-ture, sexual orientation); (d) current environmental context,stressors (e.g., unemployment, recent life event), and socialfactors (e.g., institutional racism, health care disparities);and (e) personal preferences, values, and preferences re-lated to treatment (e.g., goals, beliefs, worldviews, treat-ment expectations). Available research on both patientmatching and treatment failures in clinical trials of evenhighly efcacious interventions suggests that differentstrategies and relationships may prove fordifferent populations Zane, 1991). Many presenting symptoms\u2014for example, depres- sion, anxiety, school failure, and bingeing and purging\u2014are similar across patients. However, symptoms or disor-ders that are phenotypically similar are often heterogeneouswith respect to etiology, prognosis, and the psychologicalprocesses that create or maintain them. Moreover, mostpatients present with multiple symptoms or syndromesrather than a single, discrete disorder (e.g., Kessler, Stang,Wittchen, Stein, & Walters, 1999; Newman, Moftt, Caspi,& Silva, 1998). The presence of concurrent conditions maymoderate treatment response, and interventions intended totreat one symptom often affect others. An emerging bodyof research also suggests that personality variables underliemany psychiatric syndromes and account for a substantial part of the comorbidity among syndromes widely docu-mented in research (e.g., Brown, Chorpita, & Barlow,1998; Krueger, 2002). Psychologists must attend to theindividual person to make the complex choices necessaryto conceptualize, prioritize, and treat multiple symptoms. Itis important to know the person who has the disorder inaddition to knowing the disorder the person has. Individual Differences EBPP also requires attention to factors related to the pa- tient's development and life-stage. An enormous body ofresearch exists on developmental processes (e.g., attach-ment; socialization; cognitive, social- cognitive, gender,moral, and emotional development) that are essential inunderstanding adult psychopathology and particularly intreating children, adolescents, families, and older adults(e.g., American Psychological Association, 2004; Samer-off, Lewis, & Miller, 2000; Toth & Cicchetti, 1999). EBPP requires attention to many other patient char- acteristics, such as gender, gender identity, culture, ethnic-ity, race, age, family context, religious beliefs, and sexualorientation (American Psychological Association, 2000,2003). These variables shape personality, values, world-views, relationships, psychopathology, and attitudes to-ward treatment. A wide range of relevant research literaturecan inform psychological practice, including ethnography,cross-cultural psychology (e.g., Berry, Segall, & Kagitc \u00b8i- basi, 1997), cultural psychiatry (e.g., Kleinman, 1977),psychological anthropology (e.g., LeVine, 1983; Moore &Matthews, 2001; Strauss & Quinn, 1992), and culturalpsychotherapy (Sue, 1998; Zane, Sue, Young, Nunez, &Hall, 2004). Culture influences not only the nature andexpression of psychopathology but also the patient's un-derstanding of psychological and physical health and ill-ness. Cultural values and beliefs and social factors (e.g.,implicit racial biases) also influence patterns of seeking,using, and receiving help; presentation and reporting ofsymptoms, fears, and expectations about treatment; anddesired outcomes. Psychologists also understand and re-flect on the ways their own characteristics, values, andcontext interact with those of the patient. Race as a social construct is a way of grouping people into categories on the basis of perceived physical attributes,ancestry, and other factors. Race is also more broadlyassociated with power, status, and opportunity (AmericanAnthropological Association, 1998). In Western cultures,European or White \"race\" confers advantage and opportu-nity, even as improved social attitudes and public policieshave reinforced social equality. Race is thus an interper-sonal and political process with signicant implications forclinical practice and health care quality (Smedley & Smed-ley, 2005). Patients and clinicians may \"belong\" to racialgroups as they choose to self-identify, but the importanceof race in clinical practice is relational rather than beingsolely a patient or clinician attribute. Considerable evi-dence from many elds (Institute of Medicine, 2003) sug-gests that racial power differentials between clinicians andtheir patients, as well as systemic biases and implicit ste- 279 May-June 2006 American Psychologistreotypes based on race or ethnicity, contribute to the ineq- uitable care that patients of color receive across health careservices. Clinicians must carefully consider the impact ofrace, ethnicity, and culture on the treatment process, rela-tionship, and outcome. The patient's social and environmental context, in- cluding recent and chronic stressors, is also important incase formulation and treatment planning. Sociocultural andfamilial factors, social class, and broader social, economic,and situational factors (e.g., unemployment, family disrup-tion, lack of insurance, recent losses, prejudice, immigra-tion status) can have an enormous influence on mentalhealth, adaptive functioning, treatment seeking, and patientresources (psychological, social, and nancial). Psychotherapy is a collaborative enterprise in which patients and clinicians negotiate ways of working togetherthat are mutually agreeable and likely to lead to positiveoutcomes. Thus, patient values and preferences (e.g., goals,beliefs, preferred modes of treatment) are a central com-ponent of EBPP. Patients can have strong preferences fortypes of treatment and desired outcomes, and these prefer-ences are influenced by both their cultural context andindividual factors. One role of the psychologist is to ensurethat patients understand the costs and benets of differentpractices and choices (Haynes, Devereaux, & Guyatt,2002). EBPP seeks to maximize patient choice amongeffective alternative interventions. Effective practice re-quires balancing patient preferences and the psychologist'sjudgment\u2014 based on available evidence and clinical exper-tise\u2014to determine the most appropriate treatment. Future Directions Much additional research is needed regarding the influence of patient characteristics on treatment selection, therapeuticprocesses, and outcomes. Research on cross-diagnosticcharacteristics, polysymptomatic presentations, and the ef-fectiveness of psychological interventions with culturallydiverse groups is particularly important. We suggest thefollowing research priorities: patient characteristics as moderators of treatment response in naturalistic settings; prospective outcome studies on treatments and re- lationships tailored to patients' cross-diagnosticcharacteristics, including Aptitude /H11003Treatment in- teraction designs; effectiveness of interventions that have been widely studied in the majority population with otherpopulations; examination of the nature of implicit stereotypes held by both psychologists and patients and success-ful interventions for minimizing their activation orimpact; ways to make information about culture and psy- chotherapy more accessible to practitioners; maximizing psychologists' cognitive, emotional, and role competence with diverse patients; and identifying successful models of treatment decision making in light of patient preferences.Conclusions EBPP is the integration of the best available research with clinical expertise in the context of patient characteristics,culture, and preferences. The purpose of EBPP is to pro-mote effective psychological practice and enhance publichealth by applying empirically supported principles of psy-chological assessment, case formulation, therapeutic rela-tionship, and intervention. Much has been learned over thepast century from basic and applied psychological researchas well as from observations and hypotheses developed inclinical practice. Many strategies for working with patientshave emerged and been rened through the kinds of trialand error and clinical hypothesis generation and testing thatconstitute the most scientic aspect of clinical practice. Yetclinical hypothesis testing has its limits, hence the need tointegrate clinical expertise with the best available research. Perhaps the central message of this task force report\u2014 and one of the most heartening aspects of the process thatled to it\u2014is the consensus achieved among a diverse group of scientists, clinicians, and scientist- clinicians from mul-tiple perspectives that EBPP requires an appreciation of thevalue of multiple sources of scientic evidence. In a givenclinical circumstance, psychologists of good faith and goodjudgment may disagree about how best to weigh differentforms of evidence; over time, we presume that systematicand broad empirical inquiry\u2014in the laboratory and in theclinic\u2014will point the way toward best practice in integrat-ing best evidence. What this document reflects, however, isa reassertion of what psychologists have known for acentury: The scientic method is a way of thinking andobserving systematically, and it is the best tool we have forlearning about what works for whom. Clinical decisions should be made in collaboration with the patient on the basis of the best clinically relevantevidence and with consideration for the probable costs,benets, and available resources and options. It is thetreating psychologist who makes the ultimate judgmentregarding a particular intervention or treatment plan. Theinvolvement of an active, informed patient is generallycrucial to the success of psychological services. Treatmentdecisions should never be made by untrained persons un-familiar with the specics of a case. The treating psychologist determines the applicability of research conclusions to a particular patient. Individualpatients may require decisions and interventions not di-rectly addressed by the available research. The applicationof research evidence to a given patient always involvesprobabilistic inferences. Therefore, ongoing monitoring ofpatient progress and adjustment of treatment as needed areessential to EBPP. Moreover, psychologists must attend to a range of outcomes that may sometimes suggest one strategy andsometimes another, and they must attend to the strengthsand limitations of available research vis-a `-vis these differ- ent ways of measuring success. Psychological outcomesmay include not only symptom relief and prevention offuture symptomatic episodes but also quality of life, adap-tive functioning in work and relationships, ability to make 280 May-June 2006 American Psychologistsatisfying life choices, personality change, and other goals arrived at in the collaboration between patient andclinician. EBPP is a means to enhance the delivery of services to patients within an atmosphere of mutual respect, opencommunication, and collaboration among all stakeholders,including practitioners, researchers, patients, health caremanagers, and policymakers. Our goal in this document,and in the deliberations of the Task Force that led to it, wasto set both an agenda and a tone for the next steps in theevolution of EBPP. REFERENCES Ackerman, S.

(Appendix follows) 283 May-June 2006 American PsychologistAppendix American Psychological Association Policy Statement on Evidence-Based Practice in Psychology The following statement was approved as policy of the American Psychological Association (APA) by the APACouncil of Representatives during its August 2005 meeting. Evidence-based practice in psychology (EBPP) is the integration of the best available research with clinical ex-pertise in the context of patient characteristics, culture, andpreferences. A1This denition of EBPP closely parallels the denition of evidence-based practice adopted by the Instituteof Medicine (2001, p. 147) as adapted from Sackett andcolleagues (2000): \"Evidence-based practice is the integrationof best research evidence with clinical expertise and patientvalues.\" The purpose of EBPP is to promote effective psy-chological practice and enhance public health by applyingempirically supported principles of psychological assessment,case formulation, therapeutic relationship, and intervention. Best Research Evidence Best research evidence refers to scientic results related tointervention strategies, assessment, clinical problems, andpatient populations in laboratory and eld settings as wellas to clinically relevant results of basic research in psy-chology and related elds. A sizable body of evidencedrawn from a variety of research designs and methodolo-gies attests to the effectiveness of psychological practices.Generally, evidence derived from clinically relevant re-search on psychological practices should be based on sys-tematic reviews, reasonable effect sizes, statistical and clin-ical signicance, and a body of supporting evidence. Thevalidity of conclusions from research on interventions isbased on a general progression from clinical observationthrough systematic reviews of randomized clinical trials,while also recognizing gaps and limitations in the existingliterature and its applicability to the specic case at hand(APA, 2002). Health policy and practice are also informedby research using a variety of methods in such areas aspublic health, epidemiology, human development, socialrelations, and neuroscience. Researchers and practitioners should join together to ensure that the research available on psychological practiceis both clinically relevant and internally valid. It is impor-tant not to assume that interventions that have not yet beenstudied in controlled trials are ineffective. However, widelyused psychological practices as well as innovations devel-oped in the eld or laboratory should be rigorously evalu-ated and barriers to conducting this research should beidentied and addressed. Clinical Expertise Psychologists' clinical expertise encompasses a number ofcompetencies that promote positive therapeutic outcomes.These competencies include a) conducting assessments anddeveloping diagnostic judgments, systematic case formu-lations, and treatment plans; b) making clinical decisions, implementing treatments, and monitoring patient progress;c) possessing and using interpersonal expertise, includingthe formation of therapeutic alliances; d) continuing toself-reflect and acquire professional skills; e) evaluatingand using research evidence in both basic and appliedpsychological science; f) understanding the influence ofindividual, cultural, and contextual differences on treat-ment; g) seeking available resources (e.g., consultation,adjunctive or alternative services) as needed; and h) havinga cogent rationale for clinical strategies. Expertise developsfrom clinical and scientic training, theoretical understand-ing, experience, self-reflection, knowledge of current re-search, and continuing education and training. Clinical expertise is used to integrate the best research evidence with clinical data (e.g., information about thepatient obtained over the course of treatment) in the contextof the patient's characteristics and preferences to deliverservices that have a high probability of achieving the goalsof treatment. Integral to clinical expertise is an awarenessof the limits of one's knowledge and skills and attention tothe heuristics and biases\u2014 both cognitive and affective\u2014that can affect clinical judgment. Moreover, psychologistsunderstand how their own characteristics, values, and con-text interact with those of the patient. Patients' Characteristics, Values, and Context Psychological services are most effective when respon- sive to the patient's specic problems, strengths, person-ality, sociocultural context, and preferences. Many pa-tient characteristics, such as functional status, readinessto change, and level of social support, are known to berelated to therapeutic outcomes. Other important patientcharacteristics to consider in forming and maintaining atreatment relationship and in implementing specic in-terventions include a) variations in presenting problemsor disorders, etiology, concurrent symptoms or syn-dromes, and behavior; b) chronological age, develop-mental status, developmental history, and life stage; c)sociocultural and familial factors (e.g., gender, genderidentity, ethnicity, race, social class, religion, disabilitystatus, family structure, and sexual orientation); d) en-vironmental context (e.g., institutional racism, healthcare disparities) and stressors (e.g., unemployment, ma- A1To be consistent with discussions of evidence-based practice in other areas of health care, we use the term patient to refer to the child, adolescent, adult, older adult, couple, family, group, organization, com-munity, or other population receiving psychological services. However,we recognize that in many situations there are important and valid reasonsfor using such terms as client ,consumer ,o rperson in place of patient to describe the recipient of services. 284 May-June 2006 American Psychologistjor life events); and e) personal preferences, values, and preferences related to treatment (e.g., goals, beliefs,worldviews, and treatment expectations). Some effec-tive treatments involve interventions directed towardothers in the patient's environment, such as parents,teachers, and caregivers. A central goal of EBPP is tomaximize patient choice among effective alternativeinterventions. Clinical Implications Clinical decisions should be made in collaboration with thepatient, based on the best clinically relevant evidence, andwith consideration for the probable costs, benets, andavailable resources and options. A2It is the treating psy - chologist who makes the ultimate judgment regarding aparticular intervention or treatment plan. The involvementof an active, informed patient is generally crucial to thesuccess of psychological services. Treatment decisionsshould never be made by untrained persons unfamiliar with the specics of the case. The treating psychologist determines the applicability of research conclusions to a particular patient. Individualpatients may require decisions and interventions not di-rectly addressed by the available research. The applicationof research evidence to a given patient always involvesprobabilistic inferences. Therefore, ongoing monitoring ofpatient progress and adjustment of treatment as needed areessential to EBPP. APA encourages the development of health care pol- icies that reflect this view of evidence-based psychologicalpractice. A2For some patients (e.g., children and youth), the referral, choice of therapist and treatment, and decision to end treatment are most often made by others (e.g., parents) rather than by the individual who is the target oftreatment. This means that the integration of evidence and practice in suchcases is likely to involve information sharing and decision making inconcert with others. 285 May-June 2006 American Psychologist "}
