Gostin and Lindsay F. Wiley university of california press Excerpt391Terrorist attacks, novel infl uenzas, emerging infectious diseases, and natural disasters have prompted a reexamination of the nation's public health system. The jetliner and anthrax attacks of 2001, the SARS out-break of 2003, hurricanes Rita and Katrina in 2005, the 2009 H1N1 infl uenza pandemic, Hurricane Irene in 2011, Hurricane Sandy in 2012, the Texas fertilizer plant explosion in 2013, and the West African Ebola epidemic in 2014-15 have focused attention on public health prepared-ness. In the years following the 2001 attacks, \"the conceptual frame-work of emergency preparedness and response subsume[d] ever larger segments of the eld of public health.\" 1 The outpouring of resources and attention to biosecurity has supported a public health law renaissance. Perceived government failures in response to public health emergencies continue to stoke public anxiety, adding political pressure for more eff ective preparedness planning. All-hazards and resilience have become watchwords in preparedness. 2 Vertical strategies targeting speci c threats (e.g., development of patho-gen- or toxin-speci c vaccines and treatments) remain a priority. But horizontal strategies (e.g., investment in public health infrastructure) are chapter eleven Public Health Emergency Preparedness Terrorism, Pandemics, and Disasters Everybody knows that pestilences have a way of recurring in the world, yet somehow we nd it hard to believe in ones that crash down on our heads from a blue sky. There have been as many plagues as wars in history; yet always plagues and wars take people equally by surprise. \u2014Albert Camus, The Plague, 1948 18/12/15 8:00 PM18/12/15 8:00 PM392 | Public Health Law in Context needed to ensure preparedness for a broad range of emergencies while also enhancing capabilities to meet routine needs. At the federal level, the National Response Framework (NRF) integrates existing preparedness, response, and recovery programs to \"align key roles and responsibilities, . . . guide how the Nation responds to all types of disasters and emergen-cies,\" and ensure \"security and resilience.\" 3 At a time when governments are investing signi cant resources in preparedness for rare events that may never occur, it is politically useful to frame these expenditures and legal reforms as supporting preparedness for more likely events such as natural disasters. And in practice, obvious bene ts derive from expand-ing public health infrastructure's capacity to handle routine needs. Modern public health emergency preparedness strategies continue to draw on ancient public health law interventions such as isolation and quarantine while also adopting updated approaches to social distanc-ing, development and rapid deployment of medical countermeasures, and allocation of scarce resources under exigent circumstances. Policies must delicately balance protecting individual rights with meeting collec-tive needs, promoting cooperation and coordination across jurisdic-tions, and ensuring fairness in meeting the needs of particularly vulner-able populations. We begin by examining the federal-state balance in public health emergency preparedness. We then follow the emergency planning cycle (see gure 11.1 and table 11.1), discussing disaster and emergency declarations; evacuation and sheltering; development and rapid deployment of medical countermeasures; and isolation, quaran-tine, and social distancing. the federal-state balance in public health preparedness Public health emergency preparedness addresses hazards and vulnera- bilities whose scale, rapid onset, or unpredictability threatens to over-whelm routine capabilities. 4 It encompasses chemical, biological, radio- logical, and nuclear exposures (CBRN) as well as natural, industrial, and technological disasters (e.g., hurricanes, fl oods, earthquakes, dam failures, and radiation leaks), all of which require advance planning, rapid detection, and eff ective response. Threats may be naturally occur-ring (e.g., emerging disease outbreaks), or they may originate from intentional acts (e.g., terrorism) or unintentional releases (e.g., chemical spills).

Biosafety (a related concept) refers to the maintenance of safe conditions in biological research to prevent inad-vertent escape of hazardous materials. Biological samples can create major hazards when researchers do not use rigorous containment pro-cedures (see box 11.1). Public health emergencies unite one of the most fundamental func- tions of the federal government\u2014national security\u2014with one of the most fundamental functions of the state governments\u2014public health. Public health emergencies pose enormous challenges to American feder-alism, with myriad laws at the local, state, tribal, and federal level\u2014many of which were developed \"to address more mundane public health matters, or designed to respond to more traditional emergency situa-tions.\" 5 This federalist structure has resulted in confl icting jurisdictional claims as well as confusion about, or even denials of, ultimate responsi-bility in times of disaster management. The jetliner and anthrax attacks of 2001 launched more than a decade of capacity building, including reforms of long-standing federal disaster and emergency response laws and state public health laws. Many reforms were dramatic, including the largest restructuring of the federal adminis-trative state since the New Deal with the newly created Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the establishment of federal direct-response systems for medical resources and personnel. At the state level, the Model State Emergency Health Powers Act was adopted to some extent in thirty-nine states and the District of Columbia. The vast expansion of emer-gency preparedness laws has raised concerns about coordination among diff erent levels of government, interagency coordination within each level of government, and protections for individual rights. Since the mid-twentieth century, the federal government has assumed responsibility for nancing disaster recovery eff orts that overwhelm local resources, thus spreading the economic burden of disasters. Through health, safety, and environmental regulation and the adminis-tration's national security and international development agendas, the federal government also plays a leadership role in prevention and miti-gation. This is particularly true with regard to terror attacks and global pandemics, though climate-change mitigation eff orts have been stymied by political gridlock. 6 The federal government regulates biologic agents of public health concern (see box 11.2), conducts surveillance for emerging infectious diseases (see chapter 9), and provides nancial sup- port and guidance for state and local government preparedness eff orts.

They should never have happened. I'm upset, I'm angry, I've lost sleep over this, and I'm working on it until the issue is resolved. \u2014Thomas Frieden, CDC Director, 2014 Biosafety refers to the maintenance of safe conditions in biological research to prevent the escape of hazardous materials that could harm workers, persons outside the laboratory, or the environment. Multiple incidents uncovered in 2014 publicly embarrassed prominent govern-ment agencies and raised grave concerns about laboratory contain-ment procedures for dangerous pathogens. In June 2014, more than seventy- ve scientists and staff at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were exposed to live anthrax spores as a result of a lapse in safety procedures at two of the agency's labs. Later investigation found that CDC laboratories did not follow proper procedures for destroying the spores: scientists mis-takenly used the protocol for destroying a less robust bacterium, bru-cella. The CDC vaccinated exposed workers and gave them a preven-tive course of antibiotics; none developed symptoms. 1 The investigation also uncovered an even more dangerous lapse that had occurred earlier in the year. The U.S. Department of Agricul-ture (USDA) had asked the CDC to send them samples of H9N2 bird fl u, a strain thus far not particularly transmissible to or virulent among humans. However, the CDC mistakenly shipped a sample contami-nated with H5N1, a highly virulent strain of fl u that kills around 60 percent of those infected. Worse still, after the USDA informed the CDC lab of the mistake, six weeks passed before CDC leadership was informed. The CDC then temporarily closed its fl u and anthrax labo-ratories and placed a moratorium on shipment of biological materials from its high-security labs. 2 Other serious incidents in 2014 also illustrate signi cant biosecu- rity lapses. In April 2014, the Institut Pasteur, a French research foun-dation, discovered that 2,300 vials of the virulent coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) had gone missing from its labs. In July, samples of smallpox (an eradicated pathogen thought to be con ned to just two high-security repositories in the world) were discovered in an unused storage room at the National 1.

And in December, CDC researchers mis- takenly allowed Ebola virus samples to be handled in a less secure laboratory than required by protocols. Fortunately, the mistake was discovered within twenty-four hours and immediately reported to agency leaders. These breaches are particularly unsettling because the CDC, the NIH, and the Institut Pasteur host some of the world's preeminent research laboratories. Laboratories are indispensable for providing vital information about disease threats and developing eff ective coun- termeasures. However, these incidents show that without proper biosafety measures, labs themselves can threaten biosecurity. vider of services\u2014not merely a nancer and adviser to state and local governments\u2014represents a major expansion of its preparedness and response eff orts. The Legal Basis for Federal Preparedness, Response, and Recovery Eff orts The Robert T. Staff ord Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Staff ord Act) 7 governs federal involvement in disaster relief and emer- gency preparedness and response, while Section 319 of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) governs federal public health emergency declara-tions. 8 The terrorist attacks of 2001, the SARS outbreak, and concerns about pandemic infl uenza prompted a series of reforms to expand fed-eral capacity and support for state, local, and tribal eff orts, including the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 (Bioterrorism Act); 9 the Project Bioshield Act of 2004;10 the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act of 2005 (PREP);11 and the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act of 2006 (PAHPA, reauthorized in 2013). 12 The Bush and Obama administrations also developed the National Response Framework and the National Strategy for Pandemic Infl uenza to coordinate federal eff orts. 13 emergency declarations Federal response and recovery assistance are often contingent on spe- ci c legal declarations. Emergency declarations at the federal and state level also trigger important changes to the legal frameworks in place to deal with routine needs. In some cases, these changes expand govern- Gostin - 9780520282650.indd 396Gostin - 9780520282650.indd 8:00 PM box 11.2 \"Dual Use\" Research of Concern Multiple federal agencies (DHHS, the CDC, and the Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Inspection Service) regulate the posses-sion, use, and transfer of biological select agents and toxins (BSATs). 1 These agencies are working together to address dual-use research of concern (DURC): life sciences research intended for bene t, but which could be misapplied to do harm, such as through bioterrorism. For example, researchers may alter viruses to render them more virulent or transmissible from person to person. This research (called \"gain of function\") can improve scienti c understanding of pathogens, poten- tially facilitating surveillance and development of countermeasures. But dangerous pathogens also pose a risk of inadvertent or deliberate release from laboratories, posing risks to workers and the public at large. In 2012, researchers modi ed strains of the H5N1 infl uenza virus to facilitate airborne transmission in mammals. Following a prepubli-cation review process, the National Science Advisory Board for Biode-fense (NSABB)\u2014which provides advice, guidance, leadership, and oversight on the biosecurity aspects of DURC\u2014recommended that details of the experimental methods and results be redacted from pub-lications of the research in open forums because of the potential for this information to be used by terrorists. 2 The NSABB's advice provoked heated international debate in the academic and health communities. Some viewed the recommendations as an \"assault on the openness and accessibility upon which the modern scienti c endeavor relies.\" 3 Others argued that the even a small risk of pandemic caused by a highly transmissible, highly pathogenic infl uenza virus outweighed the bene ts of disclosing the full details of the research.4 The NSABB ultimately revised its earlier decision, recommending full publication of one paper and partial publication of another. 5 In 2013, DHHS released a framework to guide its funding of pro- posals for research anticipated to generate H5N1 viruses that are transmissible by respiratory droplets among mammals. In 2014, the White House Offi ce of Science and Technology Policy released a DURC policy developed collaboratively by several federal agencies, setting forth review and oversight requirements for DURC conducted at universities and other institutes that receive federal funding. 1.

In some instances, restraints on government power derived from individual rights are relaxed or overridden because of extenuating circumstances. Disaster and Emergency Declarations under the Staff ord Act The Staff ord Act authorizes two types of presidential declarations that trigger federal relief: major disaster and emergency. The act de nes major disaster as a \"natural catastrophe (including any hurricane, tornado, storm, high water, wind-driven water, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide, mudslide, snowstorm, or drought).\" 14 This de nition excludes pressing biosecurity threats such as bioterrorism and naturally occurring pandemics, which are thus ineligible for important forms of nancial assistance. 15 The act de nes emergency more broadly, as \"any occasion or instance for which, in the determination of the President, Federal assistance is needed to supplement State and local eff orts and capa-bilities to save lives and to protect property and public health and safety, or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in any part of the United States.\" 16 An emergency declaration authorizes the president to direct any federal agency to use its existing authorities and resources to coordinate disaster relief and to assist state and local governments with health and safety measures, issue risk and hazard warnings and health information, control public health threats, and distribute medicines and food. 17 Generally, the president's declaration must be preceded by a state gov- ernor's request.18 This traditional \"pull\" approach works most of the time, but it contributed to devastating failures in the aftermath of Hur-ricane Katrina. In the case of \"catastrophic incidents,\" the homeland security secretary (or his or her designee) can trigger expedited (and unre-quested) federal assistance (a \"push\" approach), but this authority has not been exercised to date. 19 Many were critical of the secretary's failure to declare a catastrophic incident following Hurricane Katrina.20 Instead, federal and state authorities engaged in days of negotiations while thou-sands of residents were struggling to survive in deplorable conditions. Public Health Emergency Declarations under the Public Health Services Act The PHSA authorizes a third type of federal declaration. The secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is author- PMPublic Health Emergency Preparedness | 399 ized to declare a public health emergency on nding that \"(1) a disease or disorder presents a public health emergency; or (2) a public health emergency, including signi cant outbreaks of infectious diseases or bio-terrorist attacks, otherwise exists.\" 21 The president and HHS secretary may declare emergencies simultaneously. A public health emergency declaration is not contingent on a state request. It triggers the HHS secretary's authority to make grants, nance expenses, enter into con-tracts, and conduct investigations, and to provide federal nancial assistance from the Public Health Emergency Fund. The declaration of a public health emergency also allows the HHS secretary to waive certain provisions of federal law that could impede emergency response. 22 As the federal government has become increas- ingly involved in more mundane aspects of health care delivery (e.g., ensuring access to emergency medical treatment, health information pri-vacy, and drug safety), the growing framework of federal health laws has become a potential impediment to preparedness, response, and recovery eff orts. The HHS secretary may suspend provisions relating to health care providers' conditions of participation in Medicare or Medicaid, pro-visions of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 23 and agency enforcement actions under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) 24 and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).25 State Emergency Declarations The rst responders and the infrastructure for immediate response to a public health emergency are largely governed at the level of the city, municipality, or county. Thus a broad array of state and local laws\u2014governing such matters as emergency declarations, school closure, quarantine and isolation, and professional licensing\u2014comes into play. These provisions vary from state to state and even from locality to locality. State and local laws govern a vast range of minutiae, from licensing of emergency medical technicians to disposal of corpses. In the aftermath of the 2001 attacks, policy makers and academics urged states to modernize their public health statutes to ensure legal preparedness for public health emergencies. As part of this eff ort, the CDC commissioned the Model State Emergency Health Powers Act (MSEHPA\u2014see box 11.3), which de ned a public health emergency as an imminent threat that \"poses a high probability of . . . a large number of deaths in the aff ected population; a large number of serious or long 399Gostin - 9780520282650.indd 399 18/12/15 8:00 PM18/12/15 8:00 PM400 | Public Health Law in Context term disabilities in the aff ected population; or widespread exposure to an infectious or toxic agent that poses a signi cant risk of substantial future harm to a large number of people in the aff ected population.\"26 In the decade that followed the 2001 attacks, the majority of states incorporated public health emergency declarations into their public health or disaster preparedness laws, with declarations typically triggering special authorities, regulatory fl exibilities, and nancial assistance. 27 State public health emergency declarations have been used for a vari- ety of purposes. During the 2009 H1N1 infl uenza pandemic, some gov-ernors declared public health emergencies, while others did not, feeling that existing authorities were suffi cient to handle the situation. In 2014, the governor of Connecticut declared a public health emergency to enable rapid response to potential Ebola cases, and the governor of Massachusetts, Deval Patrick, declared a public health emergency on opioid abuse. The declaration enabled him to immediately remove regu-latory barriers to naloxone access, which prevents overdose deaths (see chapter 6), ban high-risk, hydrocodone-only painkillers, and mandate that prescribers consult the state's Prescription Drug Monitoring Pro-gram (PDMP) prior to every prescription for Schedule II and III sub-stances. 28 These emergency measures were temporary, with the state health department working to make them permanent through a length-ier administrative process. evacuation and emergency sheltering: the needs of vulnerable populations In addition to lives lost to injury during a disaster, mortality and mor- bidity can be attributed to unsanitary conditions in the aftermath. Con-cerns include increased exposure to infectious disease through contami-nated fl oodwaters or unsanitary shelter conditions; 29 increased exposure to hazardous chemicals or radiological materials through unintentional releases; carbon monoxide poisoning due to the use of emergency gen-erators; 30 disruption in medical care for those suff ering from chronic conditions; and the mental health impact of devastating losses of life and property. These indirect eff ects are diffi cult to predict and quantify, but considering their magnitude is essential to eff ective preparedness and response. Climate change off ers a pertinent illustration of ongoing eff orts to adapt to anticipated impacts and save lives (see box 11.4).

In the midst of these events, the CDC asked the Centers for Law and the Public's Health at Georgetown and Johns Hopkins Universities to draft what became known as the Model State Emergency Health Pow-ers Act (MSEHPA). The model statute was designed to provide state legislatures with a roadmap for updating their public health emer-gency laws. The MSEHPA addresses ve key public health functions: preparedness and planning, surveillance, management of property, protection of persons, and communication and public information. 1 The model statute also provides clearer standards and stronger guar-antees of due process than public health statutes that predate modern judicial conceptions of individual rights. 2 Under the model statute, coercive public health powers can be exercised in response to a disease outbreak only after the governor has declared a state of emergency. 3 A declaration gives public health offi - cials the power to carry out examinations necessary for diagnosis and treatment. Authorities have the power to isolate and quarantine indi-viduals when warranted to prevent a substantial risk of transmission of infection, but they must adhere to human rights principles: choos-ing the least restrictive alternative, providing safe and habitable envi-ronments, and ful lling individual needs for medical treatment and necessities of life. Although the model statute was created with recog-nition that exigencies may preclude a predetention hearing, the gov-ernment is required to petition for a court order within ten days of issuing a quarantine or isolation directive, and detainees have the right to counsel. Nonetheless, some scholars criticized the MSEHPA for insuffi cient protection of civil liberties, particularly concerning quarantine. 4 Other 1. Lawrence O.

Learning from Past Failures Natural disasters like hurricanes Katrina and Sandy have overwhelmed emergency response systems. The slow, uncoordinated response from all levels of government left residents living on overpasses waiting to be rescued, trapped in their homes, or residing in shelters with insuffi cient food, water and medical supplies, where evacuees faced threats of vio-lence. 31 News reports exposed the horri c conditions endured by survi- vors, particularly the poor, older people, and persons with physical or mental disabilities. These events seared into the American conscious-ness the inequities that can ensue in a public health emergency and high-lighted the imperative of special attention to the needs of the disadvan-taged. Emergency management plans are often inadequate to meet the needs of vulnerable people. The failure to provide accessible emergency infor-mation may mean that people with hearing disabilities remain unaware of imminent emergencies, 32 while those with intellectual disabilities may have diffi culty comprehending evacuation messages. Individuals with mobility impairments have been left behind in evacuation eff orts because vehicles were not equipped with lifts or ramps\u2014sometimes with fatal results. Over 40 percent of Katrina survivors not evacuated in a timely manner were either themselves physically unable to leave or were caring for others unable to leave. Hospitals and nursing homes were ill equipped and failed to evacuate in time. States failed to provide an adequate Gostin - 9780520282650.indd 402Gostin - 9780520282650.indd 402 18/12/15 Emergency Preparedness | 403 number of special-needs shelters, and persons with disabilities were turned away. Those who were admitted struggled to access basic serv-ices such as medical care, restrooms, food, water, and shuttle services. 33 These failures served as a catalyst for eff orts to better integrate the needs of people with disabilities into emergency management plan-ning. 34 Congress amended the Staff ord Act to incorporate disability and special needs. The new law, called the Post-Katrina Emergency Manage-ment Reform Act of 2007 (the Post-Katrina Act), 35 required the inclu- sion of people with disabilities in every phase of planning and set out detailed guidance on the steps needed to protect persons with disabili-ties in case of disaster. PAHPA incorporated similar provisions for \"at-risk\" individuals into the PHS and established the public health and medical needs of at-risk individuals as a national preparedness objective. 36 Taken together, federal and state laws still fall short of ensuring com- prehensive protection for individuals with special functional and access needs in emergencies. These limitations have come to the fore in a series photo 11.2. Hurricane Katrina evacuees in the Astrodome shelter.

Incorporating these principles ensures that in stewardship of available scarce resources, the best possible care is given to individuals and the population as a whole.

Improving and properly supporting the public health infrastructure will be critical to managing the potential health impacts of climate change. \u2014 U.S. Global Change Research Program, Climate Change Impacts in the United States, 2014 Eff orts to limit the severity of global climate change by reducing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (referred to as \"mitigation\") have been largely unsuccessful. The ndings presented in the report quoted above\u2014that the health eff ects of climate change are already evident, and that those eff ects will intensify, signi cantly increasing mortality and morbidity\u2014serve as a wake-up call. In addi-tion to undertaking mitigation eff orts, governments worldwide are engaged in scienti c research and policy change aimed at reducing the impact of climate change on human health and well-being (called \"adaptation\"). Demands on the public health system as society adapts to the health consequences of climate change will be signi cant. In the United States, climatic and environmental changes are altering public health needs both through the introduction of new threats and through the intensi cation and geographical shifting of current threats. One of the most evident and tangible threats of climate change is more extreme weather-related disasters. Although media coverage tends to focus on natural disasters like fl oods and hurricanes that provide capti- vating visual images, the leading cause of weather-related deaths in the United States is heat waves, which are becoming more frequent and more extreme. 1 Climate change is having more gradual eff ects on health as well. Rising temperatures and more frequent wild res exacerbate poor air quality, contributing to respiratory and cardiovascular disease. Changing weather patterns may result in an increased incidence of zoonotic, vector-, food-, and waterborne diseases. 2 1.

Every public health function will be called on, but disas-ter preparedness and response, disease surveillance, infectious disease control, and vector control will be particularly salient. Whether or not they actually off er evidence of anthropogenic climate change, natural disasters like hurricanes Katrina, Irene, and Sandy, and the emergence of vector-borne diseases like West Nile virus and zoonotic diseases like hantavirus, provide a glimpse of the health hazards that global climate change will bring. The lessons learned are crucial to ongoing adaptation. ing protection to populations; antimicrobial medications can amelio- rate symptoms and reduce morbidity and mortality; and potassium iodide can protect the thyroid after radiation intake. Therapeutic coun-termeasures are crucial to an eff ective public health response to CBRN attacks and naturally occurring disease outbreaks. Yet eff ective countermeasures are not available for many of the bio- logical terrorism agents deemed most dangerous by the CDC, such as botulinum toxin, plague, tularemia, and viral hemorrhagic fevers. 45 For others, like smallpox and anthrax, countermeasures exist, but stock-piles are insuffi cient to respond to major outbreaks. The pharmaceutical industry, moreover, has few incentives to develop countermeasures for rare, unpredictable events, such as novel infl uenzas, biowarfare, or a terrorist attack. The infrequent natural occurrence of these events, the substantial expense of developing new products, the unpredictability of market demand, and an uncertain regulatory environment result in a dearth of eff ective countermeasures. 46 The Strategic National Stockpile The HHS secretary, in conjunction with the CDC and DHS, maintains a strategic national stockpile of \"drugs, vaccines and other biological products, medical devices and other supplies . . . to provide for the emergency health security of the United States . . . in the event of a bio-terrorist attack or other public health emergency.\" 47 The Project Bioshield Act of 2004 funded the procurement of medical countermeas-ures against a broad array of CBRN agents, with funding reauthorized Gostin - 406 18/12/15 8:00 8:00 PMPublic Health Emergency Preparedness | 407 in 2013.48 However, delays, bureaucracy, and lack of coordination with the private sector have plagued Bioshield.49 The development of a safer, more eff ective anthrax vaccine\u2014the government's highest priority prior to the 2014-15 West African Ebola epidemic\u2014has been mired in dis-putes. The cancellation of a large contract with VaxGen for the anthrax rPA vaccine sparked concerns about bureaucratic delays. 50 Congress has repeatedly reformed the program, most notably through PAHPA in 2006, which organized Bioshield activities under the Biodefense Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). PAHPA provided crucial funding to bridge the \"valley of death\" between National Institutes of Health funding for early-stage basic research and SNS procurement for products in the late stages of development. 51 Despite these reforms, concerns remain regarding transparency and the slow pace of development. 52 After a rocky start, Bioshield has added about a dozen new products to the SNS, with about eighty more in various stages of development.53 In the aftermath of Katrina, many criticized the investment of resources in CBRN countermeasures when the intensi cation of more routine medical needs during a disaster was a more pressing concern (see box 11.5). In 2013, controversy over federal spending on two million doses of the smallpox medicine Arestvyr, at a cost of two hundred dol-lars per dose, indicated that political support might be waning for investments in CBRN countermeasures for agents that do not pose a routine threat. In 2014, media reports gave Bioshield credit for ensuring that Ebola vaccines and treatments were already in development when the West African epidemic struck, 54 but no proven medical counter- measures were in place during the crisis. Safety Concerns about SNS Deployment Critics have also expressed safety concerns about the SNS, noting that although procurement contracts specify that manufacturers must seek FDA approval for intended stockpile uses, crucial SNS products remain unapproved. It is diffi cult to ensure that newly developed and rapidly deployed medical countermeasures are safe and eff ective. Many diseases that spread during a public health emergency may not occur naturally or may occur only in such small numbers that it is not feasible to run clini-cal trials. 55 It would be unethical to deliberately infect human partici- pants with potentially lethal agents to test the eff ectiveness of new Gostin - 9780520282650.indd 407Gostin - 9780520282650.indd 407 18/12/15 8:00 PM18/12/15 8:00 PM408 | Public Health Law in Context box 11.5 The Hurricane Katrina \"Push Pack\" Story Following the government's failed response to Hurricane Katrina, one of the many factors that emerged as having contributed to the devas-tating impact of the disaster was the failure of the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) to meet the needs of Hurricane Katrina survivors. 1 SNS supplies are stored in fty-ton push packs designed to be deliv-ered anywhere in the United States within twelve hours. The SNS is touted as being capable of responding to any public health emergency, regardless of its cause. As with many aspects of the National Response Framework, however, the emphasis on preparedness for terrorism in SNS development has detracted from its ability to meet the needs of the population following other types of disasters. Many survivors of the initial impact of Hurricane Katrina lost their medications and had diffi culty accessing and re lling prescriptions, sometimes with fatal consequences. 2 Individuals with diabetes, hyper- tension, HIV/AIDS, and other chronic conditions risk serious health complications or even death if their access to medications is disrupted. Even many months after the hurricane's initial impact, vulnerable indi-viduals were still unable to obtain the medicines they needed. Health care personnel working in New Orleans reported a rise in patients with untreated chronic illness. \"These people come in with extremely severe problems. . . . Diabetics have been off their insulin for six months. They come to us in diabetic ketoacidosis.\" 3 After Hurricane Katrina, twelve-hour push packs were deployed from the SNS but did not arrive until three days after the storm hit.4 Local governments were responsible for managing the evacuation of individuals with special needs but failed to ensure adequate care for the chronically ill. Shelters could not provide insulin, dialysis, or food 1. See Leah J.

The \"Animal Rule\" allows regulatory approval for new medical countermeasures on the basis of animal studies so long as (1) the mechanisms of toxicity of the product are well understood; (2) the eff ect is established in more than one species of animal expected to be predictive for humans; (3) the study's endpoint is clearly related to enhanc-ing human survival or preventing major morbidity (or other bene ts to humans); and (4) the workings of the drug are suffi ciently well under- stood to allow for the selection of an eff ective dose in humans. 58 The fact that manufacturers have not yet taken advantage of this regulatory path-way suggests that either the requirements are too diffi cult to meet or the incentives to seek approval are too low. 59 Other, simpler mechanisms are also available. The FDA can grant emergency use authorization, approve investigational new drug appli-cations, or exercise discretion in declining to pursue enforcement action on an emergency basis. Public health emergencies sometimes do war-rant the deployment of unapproved drugs through expedited means, but balancing the risks and bene ts under conditions of scienti c uncer- tainty is challenging. 60 Infamous government missteps in the past caution against mass deployment of insuffi ciently tested countermeas- ures, which can cause serious harm and erode the public's trust (see box 11.6).appropriate for diabetics. State and local governments were heavily dependent on the SNS for medical supplies. When they did arrive, the push packs were full of items that were useless in the aftermath of a natural disaster. 5 There were virtually no supplies for emergency man- agement of chronic diseases. Congress's report on the factors contrib-uting to the devastating eff ects of Katrina pointed to the poor selection of materials included in the push packs as a signi cant planning failure. 5. After Katrina, to prevent the waste of unsuitable and unnecessary supplies, the CDC permitted states to request supplies from the SNS without requesting a full push pack.

The swine fl u program has become part of public health lore, with the moral of the tale depending on who is telling it and why it is being told. But the swine fl u program is not the stuff of folklore. It is far too complex. There are no villains. It does not lend itself to easy analysis. \u2014 Walter R. Dowdles, \"The 1976 Experience,\" 1997 After outbreaks of infl uenza among army recruits in 1976, the CDC identi ed the causative strain as swine fl u, a virus transmitted easily through human-to-human contact.1 Amid speculation that this epi- demic would become as catastrophic as the 1918 swine fl u pandemic (which killed more than 50 million people worldwide), President Ger-ald Ford announced an ambitious program to immunize the American population. 2 Massive logistical problems ensued. The insurance indus- try informed pharmaceutical companies that it would not provide liability insurance for the swine fl u vaccine, posing a serious threat to supply. Congress acted quickly to underwrite liability costs. Despite waning support among top health offi cials, the program lurched for-ward. In October, ten days after the rst vaccinations were given, three elderly people in Pittsburgh died shortly after receiving the vaccine. Despite health offi cials' claims that the deaths were not related to the vaccine, the media adopted a body-count mentality. In November, a physician in Minnesota reported a case of ascending paralysis, called Guillian-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), that may have been related to the vac-cine. After surveillance activities revealed an increased incidence of GBS, the swine fl u immunization program was brought to an end in December. The federal government launched another mass vaccination pro- gram in the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks. Although the World Health Assembly announced the eradication of smallpox in 1980, CDC and Russian laboratories maintained repositories of the virus, and there was no assurance that it had not fallen into the hands of rogue nations or terrorist organizations. 3 Heightened concern led to 1.

Neustadt and Harvey Fineberg, The Epidemic That Never Was: Policy-Making and the Swine Flu Aff air (New York: Vintage Books, 1983); Walter R. Dowdle, \"The 1976 \"Infl uenza, 1918: A Revisit?\" New England Journal of Medicine, 294, no. 19 (1976): 1058-60. 3. In May 2014, the World Health Assembly considered (not for the rst time) whether the remaining stocks of smallpox should be destroyed but again failed to reach a consensus.

The vaccine indus-try and hospitals that administered vaccinations had sought, and received, tort immunity in 2002. 8 Health care workers requested com- pensation for injuries resulting from smallpox vaccination,9 but Con- gress did not enact a plan until April 2003, after highly publicized cases of serious adverse events. In the end, the government could not secure the needed buy-in and participation of public health and health care professionals. The program was offi cially \"paused\" in June 2003, 4.

Commentators held government scientists responsible for the swine fl u program's failure. 11 A controversial report pointed to overcon - dence among scienti c experts spun from meager evidence, conviction fueled by personal agendas, and zeal by scientists to make their lay superiors do right. 12 The smallpox campaign was also intensely criti- cized.13 Institute of Medicine ndings pointed to the White House's role in failing to communicate the policy's rationale and preventing the CDC from communicating with key constituencies. 14 Lack of planning and collaboration with major stakeholders resulted in a loss of trust in government and ultimately in the plan's failure. Although instructive, these cautionary tales still fail to answer the critical question of whether, in the face of scienti c uncertainty, it is better to err on the side of excess caution or of aggressive intervention. Consider the appropriate response to suspected bioterrorism with a microbial agent such as anthrax or smallpox. In an emergency, to whom should vaccines be made available, and under what circum-stances would the government be justi ed in mandating vaccination? The costs of inaction, if the risk materializes, are lost lives; but the costs of overreaction, if the risk is exaggerated, are wasted public funds and unnecessary burdens of vaccine-induced injury and dimin-ished autonomy. 10.

Gostin - 8:00 PMPublic Health Emergency Preparedness | 413 Ensuring Adequate Medical Personnel and Facilities Medical supplies are essential, but without adequate personnel and facilities, they are useless. In an emergency, local personnel can be rap-idly overwhelmed because staffi ng levels are dictated by routine needs rather than surge capacity. Additionally, health care workers may be burdened by the event's impact on their own lives, preventing them from reporting for duty. Government programs seek to ensure adequate facil-ities and the deployment of personnel to areas of need while facilitating the cross-jurisdictional work of volunteers. A coordinated response, facilitated by integrated planning and preparedness, is essential to ensure that government, emergency medical services, and health care providers work together to protect the population's health. The National Disaster Medical Service The National Disaster Medical Service (NDMS) provides an \"integrated national medical response capability\" 61 to assist state and local govern- ments with \"health services, health-related social services . . . and appropriate auxiliary services to respond to the needs of victims of a public health emergency.\" 62 The HHS secretary may activate the NDMS even if a public health emergency has not been declared under the PHSA. 63 Hospitals agreeing to join NDMS commit to providing a pro- portion of their acute-care beds for NDMS patients. More than one-third of all acute-care hospitals in the country are NDMS participants, and collectively they have committed more than one hundred thousand acute-care beds. Yet as one researcher notes, \"Although at rst glance, this sounds promising, even in a normal year fl u patients occupy over 114,000 hospital beds. . . . Hospitals are not eagerly lining up to con-tribute beds to the NDMS in suffi cient numbers to make a dent in the bed capacity that will be needed in the event of even a moderate infl u- enza pandemic.\" 64 Registration and Licensing of Volunteer Health Professionals Health workers are licensed at the state level, but in an emergency they may volunteer in aff ected areas outside their jurisdictions without a license to do so. The Uniform Emergency Volunteer Health Practition-ers Act, adopted in fourteen states and the District of Columbia, licenses of out-of-state practitioners seeking to provide care during a declared Gostin - 9780520282650.indd 413Gostin - 9780520282650.indd 413 18/12/15 8:00 PM18/12/15 8:00 PM414 | Public Health Law in Context emergency, provided the practitioners have registered in advance. At the federal level, ESAR-VHP establishes a national registration system to provide veri able, up-to-date information regarding volunteers' identity and credentials. 65 Allocation of Scarce Resources Even with modern eff orts to ensure surge capacity for health workers, hospitals, and medical countermeasures, scarcity remains likely for many future emergencies. A crucial bioethical question is how to ration scarce, life-saving resources: who shall live when not all can live? Rationing medical countermeasures such as vaccines and antimicrobi-als, as well as medical equipment such as respirators, requires rational ethical guidelines. Policy makers may adopt varied priorities but gener-ally take the following considerations into account. 66 Prevention and Public Health The historic mission of public health is prevention, so deployment of countermeasures in ways that impede transmission is a high priority. Rapid deployment of vaccines or prophylaxis to groups at risk could contain localized outbreaks. For example, vaccination of the direct con-tacts of an infected person in a family, congregate setting, or local com-munity could maximize the number of lives saved. Scienti c and Medical Functioning If the rst priority is public health, then it is vital to protect scientists and manufacturers engaged in vaccine or treatment discovery and pro-duction, as well as health workers. These are critical social missions necessary to save lives and provide care. Priority, for example, could be given to key personnel in developing countermeasures, delivering health care, and devising public health strategies. Social Functioning and Critical Infrastructure A large-scale pandemic could result in key sectors of society not being able to function. Many public and private actors are necessary to ensure the public's health and safety: rst responders (ambulance and re person- nel and providers of humanitarian assistance), security (police, national Gostin - 9780520282650.indd 414Gostin - 9780520282650.indd 414 18/12/15 8:00 PM18/12/15 8:00 PMPublic Health Emergency Preparedness | 415 guard, and military personnel), providers of essential products and serv- ices (water, food, and medicines), critical infrastructure (transportation, utilities, and telecommunications), and sanitation (undertakers, garbage collectors, and infectious waste collectors). Continued functioning of gov-ernance structures, such as the executive, legislative, and judicial systems, would also be important. Medical Need and Vulnerability Medical need\u2014a widely accepted rationing criterion\u2014gives priority to those who most require medical services. It requires a careful epidemio-logical evaluation of diff erential risks. Seasonal infl uenza dispropor- tionately burdens infants and the elderly, but highly pathogenic strains may disproportionately aff ect young adults. Priority could be given to those who are socially marginalized, whose living conditions may create heightened vulnerability due to overcrowding, homelessness, poor nutrition, or other chronic conditions. 67 Intergenerational Equity The medical-need criterion often favors the elderly because they are typi-cally most vulnerable. However, there may be reasons not to routinely favor this age group. 68 Interventions may be less bene cial to the elderly than to younger, healthier populations, because vaccines produce fewer antibodies in older people. Furthermore, while all human lives have equal worth, interventions targeted toward the young may save more years of life. Ethicists debate the so-called \"fair innings\" principle that each per-son should be given an equal chance of a reasonably long life, which would militate in favor of children, young adults, and pregnant women. 69 Social Justice and Nondiscrimination The allocation of bene ts according to the above criteria should not disproportionately favor the rich or politically connected. However, guidelines that are neutral on their face could produce unfair outcomes. For example, favoring scientists, health professionals, and employees of pharmaceutical companies could disproportionately bene t the well- off . Principles of social justice and nondiscrimination suggest that indi- viduals whose needs have not been met by society may have the greatest claim on health resources. 70 Gostin - 9780520282650.indd 415Gostin - 9780520282650.indd 415 18/12/15 8:00 PM18/12/15 8:00 PM416 | Public Health Law in Context quarantine, isolation, controlled movement, and community containment strategies We would not be here today [had not nurse Kaci Hickox] generously, kindly and with compassion lent her skills to aid, comfort, and care for individuals stricken with a terrible disease. . . . The court is fully aware of the misconceptions, misinformation, bad science and bad information being spread from shore to shore in our country with respect to Ebola. The court is fully aware that people are acting out of fear and that this fear is not entirely rational. However, whether that fear is rational or not, it is present and it is real. [Hickox's] actions at this point, as a health care professional, need to demonstrate her full understanding of human nature and the real fear that exists. She should guide herself accordingly. \u2014 Judge Charles C. LaVerdiere, Mayhew v. Hickox, 2014 Considerable resources are devoted to developing medical counter- measures. Despite their clinical eff ectiveness, however, medical inter- ventions may be insuffi cient to impede the rapid spread of infection during an epidemic: vaccines and medical treatments may be unavaila-ble or ineff ective, and medical supplies may become scarce. Here, we explore age-old public health response strategies, which raise vital social, political and constitutional questions because they interfere with basic human freedoms: association, travel, and liberty. Public health authorities possess a variety of powers to restrict the autonomy or liberty of persons who pose a public danger. 71 They can direct individuals to discontinue risk behaviors (through cease-and-desist orders), 72 compel them to submit to physical examination or treatment, and detain them temporarily or inde nitely. The exercise of these powers to address routine public health threats\u2014especially tuber-culosis and sexually transmitted infections\u2014is discussed in chapter 10. This section discusses two related interventions that are particularly important in the response to infectious disease emergencies for which medical countermeasures are unavailable or inadequate: isolation of persons known to be infectious, and quarantine of asymptomatic per-sons who have been exposed (or potentially exposed) to prevent trans-mission during the incubation period of a disease. We also discuss mod-ern approaches to separating the ill or exposed from society: travel restrictions and social distancing. These strategies raise social, cultural, political, and legal issues that are deeply complex and imbued with notions of community and the Other (see box 11.7).

Prior to the availability of eff ective medical counter- measures, the prevailing social response was to exclude the ill from the community to safeguard healthy members. Disease bred fear and pro-voked punitive actions. The community could justify this harsh treat-ment, in part, by blaming suff erers and branding them as the Other, deserving of ostracism. Even in more enlightened times, personal control measures have been applied in ways that may be better explained by animus than by science. Campaigns of restraint in nineteenth- and twentieth-century America demonstrate the prejudice: 3 isolation of persons with yellow fever, despite the fact that it is transmitted by mosquitoes, not from person to person; 4 arrest of alcoholics, especially poor Irishmen, in the false belief that cholera arose from intemperance;5 mass con nement in state-run \"reformatories\" of prostitutes allegedly suspected of having syphilis; 6 house-to-house searches and forced removal of children thought to have poliomyelitis;7 and quarantine 1.

In 2003, SARS fueled negative stereotypes, with suggestions that those of Asian descent were unclean and irresponsible. In 2014, fear of Ebola prompted similar overgeneralizations harmful to people of Afri-can descent and to travelers who had visited parts of Africa thousands of miles from the epidemic. In 2015, some policy makers suggested that a measles outbreak originating at Disneyland in southern Califor-nia might have been caused by immigrants crossing the border ille-gally, in spite of the fact that measles vaccination rates in Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras are higher than in the United States. The connection between disease and bias has long permeated debates about quarantine, travel restrictions, and immigration. 9 individual by providing for close monitoring and treatment of the patient. It also bene ts society by preventing transmission. Medical isolation usually takes place in a hospital with trained personnel. In a health emergency, however, hospitals would have to cope with a surge in demand for medical care, requiring more staff , beds, and equipment. As demonstrated by the case of two nurses in a Dallas community hospital who were infected with Ebola virus (see box 11.8), hospitals may be ill equipped to comply with best practices for isolation. Only a small number of state-of-the-art biocontainment units are available nationwide (at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland; Emory University Hospital in Atlanta; the University of Nebraska Med-ical Center in Omaha; and St. Patrick Hospital in Missoula, Montana). Such units provide negative airfl ow, observation windows with inter-coms, staff workspaces with biosafety hoods, and dedicated laborato- ries.

On August 8, 2014, the World Health Organization declared the West African epidemic a \"public health emergency of international concern\" under the International Health Regulations. Although West Africa was deeply aff ected, iso- lated cases of Ebola appeared in Europe and North America\u2014mostly among travelers from the region, but also, in a few cases, among health workers caring for infected patients. The fatality rate among patients treated in well-resourced hospitals was much lower than in countries whose health systems were overwhelmed. Nonetheless, the handling of the domestically diagnosed Ebola cases revealed critical health system vulnerabilities. 1 Thomas E. Duncan, a forty-two-year-old Liberian man, was exposed to Ebola in Liberia before traveling to Dallas, Texas, via Brus-sels and Washington, DC, on September 19. He did not disclose his contact with Ebola on exit screening in Liberia. At the time, he was asymptomatic and not infectious. Ebola is transmitted through direct contact between the bodily fl uids (including blood, sweat, and saliva) of an infected person and the eyes, nose, mouth, or wound of another person. The incubation period between exposure and disease is up to twenty-one days, and prior to the development of symptoms (e.g., fever and gastrointestinal distress), the infected individual does not pose a signi cant risk of transmission. Five days after reaching Dallas, Duncan went to the emergency room at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital with a fever and abdomi-nal pain. He reported his travel from Liberia, but he was sent home. On September 28, he returned to the hospital by ambulance, his con-dition having signi cantly deteriorated. He was admitted and placed in isolation but died on October 8. In the days that followed, two nurses who treated Duncan, Nina Pham and Amber Vinson, became the rst con rmed cases of Ebola contracted in the United States. Duncan's initial misdiagnosis began a cascade of public health mis- steps. Emergency medical service personnel transported him to the hospital without using appropriate personal protective equipment. The ambulance continued to transport other patients for forty-eight hours before it was decontaminated. The county health department issued a communicable disease control order requiring Duncan's part- 1. Lawrence O. Gostin, James G. Hodge Jr., and Scott Burris, \"Is the United States Prepared for Ebola?,\" Journal of the American Medical Association, 312, no. 23 (2014): 2497-98.

The residents were eventually moved to another location. Health offi cials traced Duncan's contacts, identifying nearly fty individuals, including his partner's ve school-aged children, who were told to remain at home for the remainder of the twenty-one-day incubation period. When Pham and Vinson were diagnosed, following a similar case in Spain, the CDC reconsidered the ability of hospitals to safely treat Ebola patients without specialized facilities and training, and the infected nurses were transported to biocontainment units at NIH and Emory University Hospital, where they were successfully treated with-out further transmission. Upon Pham's diagnosis, surveillance extended to about fty health workers with exposure to Duncan. Immediately prior to Vinson's diagnosis, she traveled by plane to Ohio and back, prompting concerns about potential exposure. The handling of U.S. Ebola cases off ers important lessons for health system preparedness in a globalized world. PAHPA and other federal initiatives resulted in signi cant investments in training, planning, interagency coordination, and legal reform, but signi cant vulnerabil- ities remain. Investment in crucial health infrastructure has declined: the CDC's budget was cut by 10 percent in 2013. Between 2008 and 2014, state and local public health agencies nationwide lost almost 20 percent of their workforce. Many emergency medical services agencies and hospitals are also nancially strained, leading the Insti-tute of Medicine to warn in 2012 of an \"enormous potential for con-fusion, chaos, and fl awed decision-making\" in a public health emer-gency. In the aftermath of the U.S. Ebola cases, President Obama proposed an emergency appropriation to strengthen preparedness, which Congress enacted in late 2014. 2 The media criticized the CDC for not exercising stronger leader- ship in isolation and quarantine decisions, but these functions are pri-marily state and local responsibilities. The CDC's authority is limited to preventing international or interstate transmission, a task that it implements largely through twenty federal quarantine stations. The case of Craig Spencer, a physician who had been working with Doctors without Borders treating Ebola patients in Guinea, sparked political controversy concerning quarantine policy. On returning to New York City, Dr. Spencer exhibited Ebola symptoms on October 23 and was isolated at Bellevue Hospital Center. His Ebola diagnosis prompted the governors of New York and New Jersey to impose a mandatory twenty-one-day quarantine for medical workers returning from any of the three most severely aff ected countries. Under this 2. Lawrence O. Gostin, Henry A. Waxman, and William Foege, \"The President's National Security Agenda: Curtailing Ebola, Safeguarding the Future,\" Journal of the American Medical Association, 313, no. 1 27-28. Public Health Law in Context policy, Kaci Hickox was initially subjected to compulsory quarantine in a hospital tent in New Jersey upon her return from treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone. Governor Chris Christie then reversed course, releasing her so that she could be transported to her partner's resi-dence in Maine. Upon her arrival there, Governor Paul LePage sub-jected her to compulsory home quarantine, with police offi cers sta- tioned outside the residence. Because these events transpired in the days leading up to an election, commentators questioned whether state offi cials were infl uenced by political considerations. Eventually, a Maine judge overturned the state's quarantine order. Commentators also questioned the reluctance of state and federal offi cials to declare a public health emergency. Connecticut was the only state to declare a public health emergency in response to Ebola; other states, including those where Ebola patients were present, declined to do so, determining that their powers to control routine infectious dis-ease threats (such as tuberculosis; see chapter 10) were suffi cient. On October 8, the CDC announced enhanced screening at ve U.S. airports that receive 94 percent of arrivals originating from Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea, including temperature measurement, observation for symptoms, and questioning regarding health and Ebola exposure history. These procedures, later extended to airports nationwide, authorized CDC offi cers to evaluate passengers identi ed through the initial screening as high-risk, with follow-up evaluation referred to state and local health authorities. Low-risk travelers with-out symptoms or history of exposure were given instructions for self-monitoring and were asked to provide information about their move-ments in the United States. These steps provided some measure of reassurance to the public but did not signi cantly increase protection, since passengers exhibiting no Ebola symptoms at departure airports (where exit screening was already in place) were unlikely to develop symptoms prior to arrival. Preventing and controlling outbreaks at an early stage within the source countries remain the surest ways to stem international out-breaks. Proactive eff orts to ensure global health security save countless lives and minimize the risk of international spread. 3 3. Lawrence O. Gostin and Eric A. Friedman, \"Ebola: A Crisis in Global Health Lead- ership,\" 9951 (2014): 1323-25. their bodily fl uids could be put at risk from highly infectious agents. But this specialized level of containment is simply not scalable. Can health care workers be asked (or potentially even coerced, under the threat of employment termination or revocation of licensure) to work with infec-tious patients under less than ideal 73 PM18/12/15 8:00 PMPublic Health Emergency Preparedness | 423 Home Quarantine In response to SARS and Ebola, and in current pandemic infl uenza plan- ning, policy makers stressed home or self-quarantine, sometimes called \"sheltering in place.\" Home quarantine is less onerous, more socially acceptable, and logistically simpler. Most people do not mind staying at home for short periods. However, incubation periods can extend for weeks (twenty-one days in the case of Ebola), and home quarantine is diffi cult to monitor, as individuals may feel impelled to go to work, shop for necessities, or meet family members. Home quarantine also can place household members at risk. 74 A home quarantine implies an ethical obli- gation to ensure that those who are quarantined have access to adequate care, clothing, heating, food, and water. Legal obligations to provide for those under quarantine may be found in state statutes and may also be derived from federal or state constitutional guarantees, as discussed below in the section on legal authority. Home quarantines are ostensibly voluntary, but the state may compel individuals who are noncompliant. In response to SARS and Ebola, enforcement took several forms: self-monitoring; active monitoring (daily communication with authorities to assess symptoms and fever); direct active monitoring (daily direct observation by authorities plus discussion of plans to work, travel, take public conveyances, or be present in congre-gate locations, which may or may not be permitted); controlled move-ment (also known as modi ed home quarantine\u2014prohibition on travel by long-distance commercial conveyances, and travel by local public transportation only with speci c approval); and full home quarantine\u2014 on a voluntary basis or pursuant to court order. 75 The degree of restric- tion must be commensurate with an individualized risk assessment. Indi-viduals subject to public health orders should be supported and compensated; provided with shelter, food, and lost wage compensation; and treated with respect and dignity. 76 Legal protections from employ- ment discrimination (similar to those applicable to National Guard duty or jury service) and other forms of mistreatment can also be considered, to refl ect the sacri ce of individual liberty for the common good. 77 Work Quarantine During the SARS outbreak, health offi cials employed work quarantines, restricting asymptomatic health workers exposed to SARS patients to their homes and workplaces. When individuals were not at work, they Gostin - 9780520282650.indd 423Gostin - 9780520282650.indd 423 18/12/15 8:00 PM18/12/15 8:00 PM424 | Public Health Law in Context were required to follow home quarantine rules. Work quarantine kept essential employees at their jobs while being closely monitored. Travelers' Quarantine Travelers can pose special risks: they may originate from areas with endemic disease; they often travel together in closed conditions; and they disperse to and interact with people in multiple locations. During the SARS outbreak, North American offi cials quarantined airplanes and cruise ships if passengers had suspicious symptoms until the threat level could be determined. In response to Ebola, provisions were made for the detention of travelers from countries aff ected by the epidemic if they showed fever or other symptoms. These programs are imperfect, how-ever, as travelers may be infectious without being symptomatic or may trigger thermal sensors without being infectious. Travelers may also be interviewed to assess their potential exposure to infection, with poten-tially exposed travelers required to provide contact information and submit to active monitoring. Institutional Quarantine While medical isolation and limited forms of quarantine are primarily applicable to individuals or small groups, health offi cials have also dis- cussed mass quarantines in institutions or geographic areas. In China, Hong Kong, and Singapore, apartment complexes were quarantined during the SARS outbreak. Other potential mass-quarantine venues include military bases, gymnasiums, stadiums, hotels, and dormitories. Historically, residents of congregate institutions such as prisons, mental hospitals, and nursing homes were not permitted to leave during epi-demics. They suff ered badly, as infection spread rapidly in closed, over-crowded conditions. 78 Geographic Quarantine The cordon sanitaire is a historic form of quarantine\u2014literally a guarded line between infected and uninfected districts to prevent inter-communication and spread of a disease or pestilence. Sometimes also called \"perimeter\" or \"geographic\" quarantine, a sanitary cordon restricts travel into or out of an area circumscribed by a real or virtual barrier.

Congregat- ing healthy and infected individuals together can rapidly spread infec-tion. Mass quarantines can also be unfair, as the quarantine of Chinese Americans in San Francisco at the turn of the twentieth century illus-trated. 79 Beyond justice concerns are the logistics of mass quarantines. During federal \"tabletop\" exercises, offi cials have predicted numerous deaths from con ning large numbers of people together. The logistics of determining who should be quarantined, monitoring and enforcing the quarantine, and ensuring sanitary conditions and meeting basic needs would be daunting. 80 Providing due process for a large con ned popula- tion would also be overwhelming. Above all, quarantine is politically charged. A panic-stricken public may demand overreaching quarantines that aff ect isolated individuals (e.g., travelers from aff ected countries or potentially exposed health care workers) but may strongly resist the possibility of more broadly applicable quarantine. Compliance with public health advice requires public acceptability and trust in government. Some forms of quarantine may be worth the costs if they are truly needed to impede the spread of infection, but the evidence of eff ectiveness, particularly for mass quar-antines, is limited. 81 Legal Authority for Isolation and Quarantine Overlapping state and federal governance leads to inevitable problems of federalism\u2014which government may act, which set of legal rules applies, and in what circumstances? In theory, the WHO's international health regulations (IHR) cover regional or global health hazards; fed-eral law applies to controlling disease transmission from foreign coun-tries and between states; and state or local law deals with health threats in a single state, city, or county. But behind this relatively simple-sound-ing scheme lie complex problems regarding which level of government leads the response. Public health preparedness requires clear lines of authority in an emergency, but these are rarely evident in practice. When Ebola cases were diagnosed in the United States, the CDC was criticized for issuing evolving, nonbinding guidelines for infection con-trol, quarantine, and isolation while repeatedly deferring to state and local authority. A state's authority for isolation and quarantine within its borders is derived from the police power. 82 Although all states authorize quarantine Gostin - 9780520282650.indd 425Gostin - 9780520282650.indd 425 18/12/15 8:00 PM18/12/15 8:00 PM426 | Public Health Law in Context and isolation, laws vary signi cantly. Typically, powers are found in laws governing sexually transmitted infections,83 tuberculosis,84 and commu- nicable diseases (a residual class ranging from measles to malaria).85 States whose statutes provide exhaustive lists of speci c infectious dis- eases to which public health powers are applicable may lack the power to act in the face of a novel infectious disease. Fortunately, most states have moved away from this approach, instead broadly authorizing action where necessary to protect others from infection. 86 Cooperation among state and national authorities is essential but can be undermined by dis-parate legal structures and political factors. Federal Regulations The PHSA governs national quarantine authority. In 2012, long-antici-pated federal communicable disease control regulations were nalized. 87 The regulations expand the scope of federal authority, including quaran-tine, surveillance, and sanitary measures. Federal quarantine power is lim-ited, however, to prevention of the introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the United States (e.g., at international ports of arrival) and from one state or territory into another. Even when interstate transmission was threatened during the 2014 Ebola crisis (as when a Dallas nurse, Amber Vinson, requested and was granted permission to travel to Ohio by commercial airliner), federal offi cials continued to defer to state authority while recommending more conservative (and, most would argue, evidence-based) quarantine guide-lines than some state and local authorities were recommending. The PHSA authorizes the \"apprehension, detention, or conditional release\" of individuals for a small number of diseases listed by executive order. 88 As of 2014, the president had speci ed cholera, diphtheria, infectious TB, plague, smallpox, yellow fever, viral hemorrhagic (Lassa, Marburg, Ebola, Crimean-Congo, and South American), SARS-like Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome [MERS]), and pandemic infl uenza. Federal regulations nalized in 2012 expand the scope of federal power by de ning ill person to include individuals exhibiting signs or symptoms commonly associated with quarantinable diseases, such as fever, rash, glandular swelling, jaundice, or diarrhea. 89 This inclusive approach embodies an important conceptual shift, aff ord- ing federal offi cials greater adaptability. The CDC offi cials to provisionally quar- antine travelers for as consider Thereafter, Gostin - 9780520282650.indd 426Gostin - 9780520282650.indd 426 18/12/15 PMPublic Health Emergency Preparedness | 427 offi cers can order full quarantine on grounds of a reasonable belief that a person or group is in the qualifying stage of a quarantinable disease. The length of quarantine may not exceed the period of incubation and communicability of the disease, which can range from several days (for MERS coronavirus infection) to several months (for TB). During peri-ods of quarantine, offi cers may off er individuals vaccination, prophy- laxis, or treatment, and refusal may result in continued deprivation of liberty. DHHS is authorized to pay for necessary medical and other services, but it is not bound to do so. The CDC does not intend to provide individuals with hearings during provisional quarantine, but individuals can contest a full quarantine order through an administrative hearing comporting with basic due process: notice, a neutral offi cer to oversee the hearing, and communication with counsel. Still, there are notable de ciencies in the procedures with respect to protecting individuals' rights: individuals must affi rmatively request a hearing, which may delay or prevent independent review for those who do not understand or take the initiative; the proceedings can be informal, even permitting hearings exclusively based on written documents are per-mitted; and the hearing offi cer may be a CDC employee who makes a recommendation to the CDC director. The European Court found a simi-lar scheme in the United Kingdom to violate Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which requires a hearing by a court. 91 The 2012 regulations impose duties on airports and airlines to screen passengers at borders (by such means as visual inspection and electronic temperature monitors); to report cases of illness or death to the CDC; to distribute health alert notices to crew and passengers; to collect and transmit personal information about passengers; to order physical examination of exposed persons; and to require passengers to disclose information about their contacts, travel itinerary, and medical history. The travel industry criticized the requirement to collect passenger data based on cost, while privacy advocates expressed concern about the disclosure of sensitive personal information. The PHSA empowers the CDC to provide for inspection, fumigation, disinfection, sanitation, pest extermination, and destruction of contami-nated animals or goods. 92 The rules specify that the CDC shall not bear the expense of sanitary measures; property owners incur the costs. Requiring agencies to compensate property owners would chill health regulation and place the cost of private health hazards on the public. This is particularly true for screenings at ports and borders, where individuals may be transporting infected or contaminated animals or goods that Gostin - 9780520282650.indd 427Gostin - 9780520282650.indd 427 18/12/15 8:00 PM18/12/15 8:00 PM428 | Public Health Law in Context pose a risk to the public's health. Pursuant to long-standing precedent, these provisions are not understood to require \"just compensation\" under the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment (see chapter 6). Constitutionality of Quarantine, Isolation, and Controlled Movement The Constitution does not explicitly mention quarantine. However, in discussing imports and exports, it recognizes states' powers to execute inspection laws, which are incident to quarantines. 93 Although there are multiple judicial opinions upholding the constitutionality of quarantine, they predate the Supreme Court's adoption of modern Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence in a series of cases spanning the mid-twenti-eth century (the Civil Rights Era). The validity of these precedents is thus is in question. Because these pre-Civil Rights Era cases are the most well-developed precedents available on the question of quarantine's constitutionality we present them in detail here. As described below, however, a modern court addressing the constitutionality of quarantine, isolation, or controlled movement would apply strict scrutiny and would likely nd considerable government action to be justi ed by the government's compelling need to avert or control an infectious disease outbreak (see chapter 4). As early as 1824, Chief Justice John Marshall suggested that states have the inherent authority to quarantine under their police powers. 94 From Marshall's time through the early twentieth century, numerous courts upheld detention powers. The major impetuses for judicial activ-ity were sporadic outbreaks and epidemics of venereal disease, 95 small- pox,96 scarlet fever,97 typhoid,100 diphtheria,101 and bubonic plague.102 In these contexts, private rights were subordinated to the public interest, and individuals were deemed bound to conform.103 As one court put it, quarantine does not frustrate constitutional rights because there is no liberty to harm others. 104 Even when courts recog- nized that containment cuts deeply into private rights, they still upheld public policy. 105 The judiciary, however, did assert some control over isolation and quarantine. Following a \"rule of reasonableness\" established in Jacob-son, courts insisted that detention be justi ed by \"public necessity\" 106 and that states may not act \"arbitrarily\" or \"unreasonably.\"107 Even though their decisions were not always clear or consistent, the courts Gostin - 9780520282650.indd 428Gostin - 9780520282650.indd 428 18/12/15 8:00 PM18/12/15 8:00 PMPublic Health Emergency Preparedness | 429 generally set three limits on civil con nement in the pre-civil rights era. First, health authorities had to demonstrate that individuals had, in fact, been exposed to disease and posed a public risk.108 Second, the courts periodically insisted on safe and healthful environments for quarantine because public health powers are designed to promote well-being, not to punish. 109 Finally, courts struck down interventions that were discrimi- natory. In Jew Ho v. Williamson , a federal circuit court struck down an invidious quarantine measure.110 Public health offi cials had quarantined an entire district of San Francisco, containing a population of more than fteen thousand, ostensibly to contain bubonic plague. The quarantine applied exclusively to the Chinese community. The court held the quar-antine unconstitutional on grounds that it was unfair: health authorities had acted with an \"evil eye and an unequal hand.\" 111 Jew Ho serves as a reminder that quarantine can be used as an instrument of prejudice and subjugation of marginalized populations. 112 Although these early cases still have infl uence, constitutional doc- trine has changed markedly since the civil rights era of the mid-twenti-eth century. As explained in chapter 4, the Supreme Court has devised a tiered approach to constitutional adjudication, which requires height-ened scrutiny of state action that invades an important sphere of liberty, such as the right to travel. 113 In cases concerning mental illness, the Court has described civil commitment as a uniquely serious form of restraint, constituting a \"massive curtailment of liberty.\" 114 Under the Supreme Court's strict scrutiny analysis, the state must have a compel-ling interest that is substantially furthered by the detention. 115 Risk of Transmission Under a strict scrutiny standard, only persons who pose a signi cant risk of transmission can be con ned. Lower courts have gone further by requiring actual danger as a condition of civil con nement in cases involving both mental health 116 and infectious disease.117 Mass con ne- ment (e.g., geographic or institutional quarantine) raises constitutional questions. If some members of the group do not pose a risk of transmis-sion, the state action may be deemed overly broad. The Supreme Court nds overinclusive restraints constitutionally problematic because they deprive some individuals of liberty without justi cation. Consequently, health offi cials should, to the extent feasible, order quarantine only for those who demonstrably pose a risk to the public.

However, the state probably does not have to go to extreme or unduly expensive means to avoid con nement. 119 Procedural Due Process Persons subject to detention are entitled to procedural due process. As the Supreme Court recognized, \"There can be no doubt that involuntary com-mitment to a mental hospital, like involuntary con nement of an individ- ual for any reason, is a deprivation of liberty which the State cannot accomplish without due process of law.\" 120 The procedures required depend on the nature and duration of the restraint.121 Certainly the state must provide due process for long-term, nonemergency detention.122 Not- ing that \"civil commitment for any purpose constitutes a signi cant depri- vation of liberty,\" and that commitment \"can engender adverse social consequences,\" the Court has held that, in a civil commitment hearing, the government has the burden of proof by \"clear and convincing evidence.\" 123 In Greene v. Edwards (1980), the West Virginia Supreme Court held that persons with infectious disease are entitled to similar procedural protections as persons with mental illness facing civil commitment. 124 Procedural safeguards include the right to counsel, a hearing, and an appeal. Rigorous procedural protections are justi ed by the fundamen- tal invasion of liberty occasioned by long-term detention, 125 the serious implications of erroneously nding a person dangerous, and the value of procedures in accurately determining complex facts. Where neces-sary, temporary orders may be permissible with postdetention review. Community Containment Strategies Isolation and quarantine are the most widely discussed, and most con- troversial, public health strategies, but a variety of other strategies are available for stemming infectious diseases. Community containment strategies include personal hygiene, social distancing, and border con-trols. Several empirical and policy evaluations of community contain- Gostin - 9780520282650.indd 430Gostin - 9780520282650.indd 430 8:00 PMPublic Health Emergency Preparedness | 431 ment have been published as part of strategic planning for highly patho- genic infl uenza.126 Community Hygiene Hygienic measures to prevent the spread of respiratory infections are broadly accepted and widely used for infl uenza and other infectious dis- eases with epidemic potential. 127 Infection control includes hand wash- ing, disinfection, respiratory hygiene (etiquette for coughing, sneezing, and spitting), and personal protective equipment (PPE\u2014masks, gloves, gowns, and eye protection) for health care workers. Evidence of eff ec- tiveness varies and depends on the setting\u2014community or congregate facility (hospital, school, nursing home, or prison). Evidence supports hand hygiene in all settings. 128 PPE and disinfection are standard hospital practices.129 However, the eff ectiveness of these measures in other settings is unclear, and further research is needed to understand its appropriate role. For example, mask use was common, and even legally required, in the 1918 infl uenza pandemic and was adopted by many individuals dur- ing the SARS and Ebola outbreaks. Contrary to popular belief, however, masks primarily provide protection for others when worn by an infec-tious person. Although they may block large aerosolized droplets and discourage the wearer from contacting her mouth with her own hand, thereby reducing transmission from fomites, paper surgical masks may not t tightly enough to block the smaller droplets that may play an important role in transmission of airborne pathogens. 130 Even if hygienic measures are eff ective, professionals and the public must use them properly and sustainably. Infection control precau-tions (e.g., tight- tting N95 respirators) must be used reliably until the risk subsides, but their use may be burdensome, leading to low com-pliance. Studies demonstrate inconsistent infection control in hospitals, and the general public has not uniformly adopted even basic hygiene practices such as hand washing. Decreased Social Mixing and Increased Social Distance Past experience shows that social separation and community restric-tions are important responses to epidemics. It is assumed that decreased social mixing slows transmission of airborne pathogens, and avoidance of high-risk settings (e.g., swimming pools) may slow indirect fecal-oral transmission. Thus, governments have closed public places (malls, Gostin - 9780520282650.indd 431Gostin - 9780520282650.indd 431 18/12/15 8:00 PM18/12/15 8:00 PM432 | Public Health Law in Context workplaces, mass transit, and swimming pools) and canceled public events (sports events, performances, and conferences) during infectious disease outbreaks. During the SARS outbreak, for example, health offi - cials ordered widespread closures of schools, day care facilities, hospi-tals, factories, and hotels. During the 2009 H1N1 epidemic, schools were closed in some districts. As fear rises, people may shun social gath-erings of their own accord. Predicting the eff ect of policies to increase social distancing, however, is diffi cult. Policy makers are particularly interested in school closures as a dis- ease mitigation strategy. Modeling studies suggest that, since children are effi cient transmitters of infection, school closures would impede the spread of epidemics. 131 The key question, of course, is whether students stay at home or disperse to malls, movie theaters, and other crowded spaces. Closing schools for short periods does not have major social rami cations, but pandemics can endure for many months. During such extended school closures, children and adolescents would miss learning, social development, and in-school meals. Additionally, parents would have to stay home to care for young children, which would aff ect public services and productivity. Social distancing, particularly for long durations, can severely disrupt the economy and cause loneliness and depression. Community restric-tions raise profound questions regarding culture, faith, and family. Com-ing together with fellow human beings in civic or spiritual settings aff ords comfort in a time of crisis. When loved ones are ill, there is a strong need to comfort them with physical contact. People who lose loved ones to a dreaded disease yearn to express their grief in churches, social groups, and funeral services. But even these assemblies could be discouraged or disallowed, as they were during the 2014-15 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. As with many disease mitigation strategies, the vulnerable would suff er most from social distancing, particularly those who cannot stock up on food, water, and clothing, and those who need assistance, such as disabled persons. Assuring the conditions for health is a government responsibility, but the community also plays a vital role. The constitutional questions are equally complex, as the Supreme Court nds travel and free association to be fundamental rights. 132 Undoubtedly the courts would uphold reasonable community restric-tions, but legal and logistical questions loom: who has the power to order closure, by what criteria, and for what period of time? The exercise of public health powers requires rigorous safeguards: scienti c risk assessments, the provision of safe and environ- Gostin - 8:00 PMPublic Health Emergency Preparedness | 433 ments, procedural due process, use of the least restrictive alternative, and attention to social justice. Public health emergencies are deeply divisive. The government must earn the public's trust by acting trans-parently, fairly, and eff ectively. The way we respond to a health crisis\u2014 whether we choose to exercise authoritarian powers, whether we pro-tect the vulnerable\u2014refl ects on the kind of society we aspire to be. Ideally, a resilient society can withstand and recover from a disaster with minimal disruption. 133 Resilience encompasses the principles of equity and social justice, recognizing that the social, political, and cul-tural contexts of emergencies produce an inequitable distribution of crit-ical resources, and that fair and eff ective planning should seek to address these inequities. It entails building core capabilities and public services in vulnerable communities to prepare them for emergencies while also serv-ing routine public health needs. 134 Toxin- and pathogen-speci c emer- gency planning activities \"cannot be a substitute for a broad, progressive eff ort to improve services for those who are vulnerable or who have been pushed to the margins of society because of ethnic and racial discrimina-tion, poverty, or the fact of living with chronic illness and disability or being in need of long-term care.\" 135 A commitment to building commu- nity resilience also implies that vulnerable populations should not be viewed as a liability but can serve as a critical resource in preparedness, response, and recovery eff orts if policy makers engage them in the plan- ning stage.

App. 1919) (ordering dis- charge of people held in jail for lack of evidence that they had a venereal dis-ease). 108. Smith v. Emery, 42 N.Y.S. 258, 260 (N.Y. App. Div. 1896) (\"The mere possibility that persons may have been exposed to disease is not suffi cient. . . . They must have been exposed to it, and the conditions actually exist for a com-munication of the contagion.\"); Ex parte Shepard, 195 P. 1077 (Cal. Ct. App. 1921) (holding that mere suspicion of venereal disease is insuffi cient to uphold quarantine order); Ex parte 814, 816 (Cal. unsupported by facts . . . will aff ord no jurisdiction at all for depriv- ing people of their liberty\"); Arkansas v. Snow, 324 S.W.2d 532 (Ark. 1959) (holding that commitment for TB treatment requires a nding that the patient is a danger to the public health). 109. The court in Kirk v. Wyman, 65 S.E. 387, 391 (S.C. 1909), would not subject Mary Kirk to an unsafe environment. She was to have been isolated in a pesthouse\u2014a \"structure of four small rooms in a row, with no piazzas, used heretofore for the isolation of negroes with smallpox, situated within a hundred yards of the place where the trash of the city . . . is collected and burned.\" The court concluded that \"even temporary isolation in such a place would be a seri-ous affl iction and peril to an elderly lady, enfeebled by disease, and accustomed to the comforts of life.\" See Jew Ho v. Williamson, 103 F. 10, 22 (C.C.N.D. Cal. 1900) ( nding that con ning large groups of people in an area where bubonic plague was suspected placed them at increased risk). The court was less rigor-ous, however, in reviewing the conditions of isolation in Ex parte Martin, 188 P.2d 287, 291 (Cal. Ct. App 1948). The court supported giving health offi cers discretion as to the place of isolation. The county jail was designated as a quar-antine area for people with STDs despite the uncontested evidence that it was overcrowded and had been condemned by a legislative investigating committee. The court supported the attorney general's position that \"while jails, as public institutions, were established for purposes other than con nement of diseased persons, occasions of emergency or lack of other public facilities for quarantine require that jails be used.\" 110. Jew Ho v. Williamson, 103 F. 10 (C.C.N.D. Cal. 1900). The quarantine in Jew Ho directly followed another public health initiative designed to harass Chinese residents of San Francisco. In Wong Wai v. Willliamson, 103 F. 1 (C.C.N.D. Cal. 1900) the court struck down as discriminatory an order that required all Chinese residents to be vaccinated against bubonic plague prior to leaving the city. 111.

United States, 323 U.S. 214, 218 (1944) (\"Nothing short of . . . the gravest imminent danger to the public safety can constitutionally justify\" either \"exclu-sion from the area in which one's home is located\" or \"constant con nement to the home\" during certain hours); Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346, 356 (1997) (noting that while freedom from physical restraint is at the core of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause, that liberty interest is not abso-lute); State v. Snow, 324 S.W.2d 532 (Ark. 1959) (holding that civil commit- ment law is not penal, but is to be strictly construed to protect rights of citi-zens). 114. Vitek v. Jones, 445 U.S. 480, 491 (1980) (holding that an inmate was entitled to due process before being transferred to a mental institution); see Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 425 (1979) (holding that civil commitment is a \"signi cant deprivation of liberty\"). 115. City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 440 (1985). But see Seling v. Young, 531 U.S. 250 (2001) (stating that civil commitment of vio- lent sexual predators must only bear a rational relationship to state goals of treatment and incapacitation). 116. See, for example, Suzuki v. Yuen, 617 F.2d 173, 178 (9th Cir. 1980) (holding that a Hawaii law allowing civil commitment on the threat of harm to any property was unconstitutionally overbroad). 117. Although courts defer to the professional judgment of health offi cials, they do require a nding of a danger to the public. See Souvannarath v. Hadden, 116 Cal. Rptr. 2d 7, 11-12 (Cal. Ct. App. 2002) (discussing a California statute that requires a nding that a tuberculosis patient is both a danger to the public health and substantially unlikely to complete treatment before the patient can be con ned for treatment); Snow, 324 S.W.2d at 534 (basing the rationale for commitment on \"the theory that the public has an interest to be protected\"); In re Halko, 54 Cal. Rptr. 661 (Cal. Ct. App. 1966) (holding that the isolation of person with TB does not deprive that person of due process if the health offi cer has reasonable grounds to believe he is dangerous); Moore v. Draper, 57 So. 2d 648, 650 (Fla. 1952) (holding that when a person's disease is arrested to the point where he is no longer a danger, he may seek release); Moore v. Armstrong, 149 So. 2d 36 (Fla. 1963) (same). 118. Souvannarath, 116 Cal. Rptr. 2d at 11-12 (discussing a California stat- ute that requires health offi cers to list in detention orders what less restrictive options were considered and why they were rejected); City of New York v. Doe, 614 N.Y.S.2d 8 (N.Y. App. Div. 1994). The most fully developed expression of the right to less restrictive alternatives is found in mental health cases. See, for example, Covington v. Harris, 419 F.2d 617 (D.C. Cir. 1969) (requiring a nd- ing that there are no less-restrictive alternatives to holding a patient in the max-imum security section of a psychiatric hospital); Lessard v. Schmidt, 349 F. Supp. 1078 (E.D. Wis. 1972) (requiring consideration of less restrictive alterna-tives prior to civil commitment). See also Model State Public Health Act \u00a7 Gostin - 5-108(b)(1) (Pub. Health Statute Modernization Nat'l Excellence Collabora- tive 2003) (requiring that isolation and quarantine be used only when they are the least restrictive means necessary). 119. Lawrence O. Gostin, \"The Resurgent Tuberculosis Epidemic in the Era of AIDS: Refl ections on Public Health, Law, and Society,\" Maryland Law Review, 54, no. 1 (1995): 1-131. 120. O'Connor v. Donaldson, 422 U.S. 563, 580 (1975) (Burger, C.J., con- curring) (holding that the involuntary commitment of a patient who was not a danger to himself or others in a psychiatric hospital violated his constitutional rights). See Vitek v. Jones, 445 U.S. 480 (1980) (requiring procedural due proc- ess before the transfer of a patient from prison to a psychiatric hospital); Project Release v. Prevost, 722 F.2d 960 (2d Cir. 1983) (upholding civil commitment under a law that adequately protected procedural and substantive due process); Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418 (1979) (holding that civil commitment requires a nding that the patient was a risk to himself or others by more than a preponderance of the evidence). 121. Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210 (1990) (holding that prisoners' right to refuse medication must be balanced against the state's interest in treat-ing mentally ill prisoners and maintaining a safe prison). 122. See, for example , In re Ballay, 482 F. 2d 648, 563-66 (D.C. Cir. 1973) (requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt of dangerousness for a long-term civil commitment); but see Morales v. Turman, 562 F.2d 993, 998 (5th Cir. 1977) (the \"state should not be required to provide the procedural safeguards of a criminal trial when imposing a quarantine to protect the public against a highly communicable disease\"). 123. Addington, 441 U.S. at 425, 426 (requiring that the standard of proof in commitments for mental illness must be greater than the preponder-ance of evidence standard, but that the reasonable doubt standard is not constitutionally required). See also Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715 (1972) (holding that due process requires that the nature of duration of commitment bear some reasonable relation to the purpose for which the individual is com-mitted). 124. Greene v. Edwards, 263 S.E.2d 661 (W. Va. 1980). 125. However, the Supreme Court has ruled that the incurability of a dan- gerous condition, which entails a high likelihood that the detained person will not ever be released, is not, alone, grounds to invalidate that person's civil con- nement.
