In our Sunday evening cabbage punch saga event we beat more rounds as humans than before. A Z N evaded capture in the first round until the end and Kasper broke a high record for a beginner.

Through assisted genocide of waterfiends in their ancient cavern habitat, Piney ananas comosus achieved her first combat mastery in strength and third 99 in a skill.

Seven lightsgave his lesson on universally preferred behavior at the vault in the basement of varock's large bank with first time attendees Sin and Creydo. General Zorak achieved immortality in battle against zoomy oo-chee-ha at the duel arena Sunday. New Order and awesome and beloved allies and friends witnessed bestowment of the constitution cape on Zorack, a symbol of a life force over 9000. Through the vagueness of Kasper's hints to the frequented location of the zoo where he hid, he was one of the two to hold a spot for the longest in Monday's game, found first by non participating Zorack then by seven who shared the most finds of a player with kas. I tied with Kasper by choosing a more atypical hiding place. Sin chose the most original spot on a small island within view of Morgan La Fey's backyard. I was invited to dinner at the house of sorceress Miss Kit of you love me with Davey and Cat on Tuesday. We lifted our chopsticks in celebratory toast of her first skill mastery of firemaking and enjoyed fine curry. King Davey joined me in exploring the new features of the upgraded Nors sitadel with the best so far being the altar at the guard's post in the senate room and the highly anticipated theatre. Seven experimented with the set design creating a dragon's lair with a squad of goblin guards and trouble brewing. Snowverload appeared at the G E, and along with everyone in world 53 we grabbed balls to melt the monstrosity by pelting him with more snow and antagonized him from Varock to Lumbridge down alleys and across ramps and footbridges into the hands of Santa. When there, Lord Hakumen shared his cracka lacka with me. Kurama gave himself to Pie at the duel arena as a last nourishment needed to achieve a guranteed sweeter longer lasting taste, his second skill mastery in constitution. Beloved and awesome ally guests King Davey of you love me and Champion p v p er Biggy of the Zeerack Kingdom were the captains of friend chat battles last night. Team Biggy was intent on defeating the rival captain who stood from start to finish in the forsaken quarry. The second battle was a tactical scramble on the peanut butter plateau with other advantages available that I prefer not to use. We fought the final battle to 25 kills at the blasted forest engaging in single way with anyone with room to move on the small nuclear wasteland. The sitadell is at tier 5 with increased upkeep and visitor requirements. So far, we have met timber and precious bars, almost metal. We are at a fourth of the stone collection.

Three cosmic tentacle entwined nefarious weapons call from solomon's store in the form of a soul edge sword, reach bow, and spire staff. Riding in on Sin's Shiny meat bicycle fleet, we blasted our way with 50 k power into a radioactive teutonic thrash on Friday, the first party at the clan sitadell since its upgrade to tier 5. We were honored with the first time presents of bugle of Ye Olde Pub and with Austin of you love me who had his birthday on that day and chose to end his 24 hour journey with us recalling his time spent with his beloved Jaimee, who we hope to meet. The mighty king Davey of you love me stepped in for a few good minutes with us. Seemingly Stoic Minerva arrived to the party with a single thing on her mind, a duel with Ascaluphus that they took inside of the Mental Arena School on Battlefield A. Sweet Miss Honey returned to host the Awesome Zeerack Kingdom's Castle Wars event with Poki on Saturday. I geared up at the stations and after a bang at the door I moved into the opposing territory past aerial attacks to the top forgotten, snatched the flag, and made a single successful capture. I was locked out and shot down in following attempts and had another near success being covered by Asca. At the end my new objective was to clear the way for invasion. Goldie Kurama had the most captures. I went with Honey and Jad to castle wars world 24 where double tickets were being rewarded for being in games and I commited to attempts while many waited. I flew into Daemonheim with Master Miss Honey post c w for complete expedition of the arcane archaic and we smashed through a few floors padding each room with her sweet guidance andvanced skills piercing and poking out beasts with an echoing roar of thunder trailing behind us. Miss Minerva selected Ascaluphus for a duel at duh house firmly establishing him as a sparring partner with stunning encouragement and a complete lesson on the abilities. Our beloved allies you love me held an excellent expansive celebratory party at their sitadell in honor of the birthdays of Austin and Miss Kitty, having now had three birthdays within their clan in December. There were advante garde costumes, romantic and alternative emotive dancing from a master, and Nutella. Dexterous Davey of you love me brought his expertise to our Heiist event Sunday evening which introduced a few clanmembers to the game. As a guard, Davey achieved a higher consciousness of spaces with his watchful eyes and third eye in the security sensor. When we switched sides, Minerva and I remained glued to the bank to catch Davey after his transcendent powers had reached the outer limits of treasure on the map and Minerva took him into custard and we caught Ruby pale handed. I had some more success as the game went on changing forms for each endeavor in a strand of robberies and avoiding apprehension narrowly by becoming like a needle until caught dead in drag and recruited to the guard force. When we finally caught Davey, he quickly spaded his way out of prison for another bid and accidental body snatch in sight. After finding Miss Kitty, Sin continued to have the most finds in search party hide n seek on Monday and claimed 2 more islands, while seven would hide the most giving only 1 mostly unrealized obvious hint during his first hide being found apparently by Sin and Kitty at the same time. While Kitty was found by Dawnie, I found Sin and held the longest consistent spot and Mr 95 joined in and hid last. The city bore the fruit of the loom and a blue bacon machine on Tuesday. Seven was the first capper at the tick for the fifth time in a row. We attempted two rounds of Barbarian assault on level one for a first time with Piney and Ruby and directing help from Zor. King Davey of you love me glided in and through the game in freestyle on his custom glitch blue snurfer. There was understandable death but promising though halted progress seen in the second round. We knocked around with Zeerack Kingdom p v p champions Biggy and Zeratcher at free for all safe clan wars yesterday. Taking them on with their guardians in place without resources aside from the paramount protective combat stance seemed impossible for me. Besides Zeratcher, only Jen was able to defeat Biggy as I sparred with the Lord of the Undead. Later, after the remarkable clan meeting with celebrated guests Biggy and Delta and an in depth discussion of awkward silence between Seven and Piney, we headed to tzhaar city for scattering and square dancing with Biggy again. There were exceptional smashes dealt by a few first timers and some inspired interest among us in adopting other combat styles. Nors Updates 64: Purchase a mysterious shaking barrel from solomon's store and strike it in a period of 3 minutes with a group to see who has the highest damage to stand on. After enough damage has been done, a dward splashes out and yelps the winner. He providdes a list of the top 10 hitters and the hits are broadcast in local chat. A consumable item. Zorack was the master of his doman, in his created game of advanced wilderness survival on Friday. I guided Ruby for gathering and we had our fragmental armor hammered together by the time Zor had killed most other brave survivors. We pressed on to the beach to fish, until we were discovered by the more set Zor before having the chance to cook and he jabbed me down with a pokey stick, leaving Ruby to have the last standoff with Zor at the bloodwood tree using her cat hands. At da house we held the victory party for Ruby honored by the presence of Ally guests King Davey of you love me and Biggy and Miss Inferno of the Zeerak Kingdom. I gave a summary of the history of Nors around Davey's carpet lit fire and the party eventually shifted to the gym and grew. Together, we all immeresed ourselves into a turbulent combat storm as Miss Inferno's innocent panda looked on. We went back to the mystics camp on Saturday to experience Stealing Creations with our awesome allies the zeerack kingdom hosted by the sovereign sweet honey and Ralph. It was a first time event for Seven with insightful guidance from Honey. In competition with the champion matty worrier, everyone strived for the most expansive and consistent gathering without intended combat. Seven and I made a landing in Daemonheim to join the Social Code hosted by Queen Catty in breaking down the doors in their entirety and stampeding through with inductive reasoning, punctual healing, and utilization of a handful of other polished skills contributed with the help of knight and Miss Bee, with only a single casualty. The elegant Catty went on with us to disparate climate in the kharidian desert with Minnie to raid and squash the Kalphite Queen that adapted to withstand our extremes and not give Seven x p for some reason. We then made an attack on its ally the k g b with catty casting out blue chocoboos and saberhagens. We got in under the surface for two short adventure modes finding an increased number of totems and pocket monster cards in sinkholes rewarding level ups and pumped up slippers. I was formally met by mellificent for the first time with a tin of delcious chocolate chip cookies and snow elf lain at Lumwood manor. We discussed the nature of events and scheduling then took it to the grind rail to each attempt to attain the perfect balance. Seven gave his sunday philosophy lesson on detachment at the newly built mental arena school on battlefield a of the city. GhostReaper had led me to believe that we were playing his first game of conquest at the event on Sunday. I had to resort to the use of hit and run tactics with the use of fewer remaining men to even out the course of the game leaving a single footsoldier on either side waiting for the oppurtunity to impinge with the use of charge and battle cry in the last phase. Minerva brutally cornered every last man on my terrain with excessive damage dealt from each of her rangers easily winning the game. Snow elven lain and his dear miss Mel the baker and p v p champion Biggy of our awesome allies the Zeerack Kingdom dropped in and made for a riveting game of search party on Monday with Biggy having the most finds and longest held spot. Lain found Ghostreaper in Lumwood swamp near trees and flew to ice mountain on Mel power being found by the blue moon inn and winter solstice aligned Biggy as spotted by Sin Vicious. Sin made a charming zombie monkey of himself to hide in ardougne zoo found by me, and I sat by the batdemic in the blackened ground wearing my drape jacket to be recovered by Seven. Seven was seen with Rowena by Miss Mel on the burnt out witchhaven island. Biggy discovered Mel on the buried bald eagle's peak but let Lain have his second turn though he would be the first to arrive at the palace that Lain was staying at and then have the longest held spot on Relleka in the turf of Hati and skoll. We shot over to lum crater with Biggy and everyone in world 53 for the ultimate cracker pull cut scene for some festive treasure and a hilarious joke. Then I mined a crashed star with Zor. After the citi tick with Lay being the first to cap on Tuesday, we voted in favor of a third choice of event which was Burthrope games room supervised by Runelink master Lee Hemlock. I played a rematch game of force take checkers with him and four or so successive rounds of Runelink with Zor, winning at least one accidentally. Queen catty watty of the Social Code became a high priestess last night essentially through the most difficult earthly means on free to play with 15 x p per burial of big bones in inclusive sight of the social code, and members of the zeerack kingdom, you love me, and New Order. Then we went to the home world of the social code where she could be bestowed the prayer cape and ascend. We met at midpoint of Draynor with our awesome allies Lain and Biggy of the Zeerack Kingdom for an astronomical celebratory Nors parade for clanniversary inspired by special occasions that led up to the official establishment of the clan five years ago. Wearing accoutrements of the old times we traced the circumference of Wiz Kalifa tower. From the bridge we trudged through the swamp to the Lum Bridge and started building a trail of fire that would lead across the winding road and through the entrance of Varock to our first stop at the blooming inn for beer steins. We entered the dojo, bowed our heads, and sipped our ale before proceeding to our next stop at the Jolly Boar Inn for more steins, and out into the sawmill to drink. Last, we headed to the Grand exchange to place our vexes in three corners and veggie bombed a layer across the entirety.

These items will be on sale for 25 percent and each day one of the items will go on sale for 66 percent. Following secret testing of a new facility for combat in the make on battlefield b with assistant Mag Sev on Friday, Ascalaphus and I flew in to Tav to experiment with the endurance of his new dragon rider gear and intermediate dual Korasi and excalibur style that pierced through the force field and rattled me. Later, we organized a short march from Burthrope to the Grand Exchange placing vexilums at the banks, through pie, and claiming white wolf mountain. Creydo and I went back to Taverly for a visit with the royals Lady Bev and Davey of you love me for a four person waltz with the eternal love affair to a fruitful creative and providence rooted discussion. Under the directive of Princess Lovely Kitty of you love me, we made our descent on the k g b. We had the pleasure of meeting Miss Kit's little sis Kitten and it was GhostReaper's first encounter of the three headed kind. Outside in Edgeville, vigilant citizens awoke to find a demon mob boss terror wandering alone near the monastree and we excerted ourselves to the fullest in our attempt to capture it. Within 5 minutes or less that begged for more, Ghost and I completed our co op scorpion slayer task. Asca was Ghost's designated sweepstakes black ops fighter in his chosen venti bout. Ghost made a rip before his fall and always looks on the bright side of life. With Davey of you love me and p v p champion Delta and Elven Lain of Zeerack Kingdom, we contended in an ardent event of advanced wilderness survival. I found Davey at the forinthry dungeon and in length our glorious battle was the peak in the game. I was bested again. When I was a slain main, Davey traced Ghost at the site of his rugged bearded crusade to wash his lands of bots. Davey and Ghost spun off into toasty live action at the volcano. Finishing Ghost, Davey went down south to find the prospering serene elvin lain for the last sun dance. Our awesome and beloved allies Miss Honeysuckle and Miss Mel of the Zeerack Kingdom and Davey of you love me sprung into Lumbridge with us for the lighthearted event of cabbage punch saga on Sunday which was a first for Ghost and Miss Honey. Gorrilas would chase and surround the mighty Davey through every passage and corner without abandon and zealously make a target of some spikey guy. We never ceased in gathering and boxing monkeys and quickly switched to lay traps when being turned into apes between chases and through the flames. I got to have my first taste of necrolord occult floor expedhition with sweet miss honey and the authorities of the zeerack kingdom. We burned down the walls and turned the gears. I was given a searing hot bath in acidic purple rain and we cleaned up the mess. GhostReaper gave me a proper tour of his stellar Linden wood country style inn on Monday with two quarters, private seating, 3 dining room resturaunt, and prospects. Kasper was the definitive locator in search party hide n seek finding frend in the edgeville dungeon, Lay at mobilising armies, and Asca first. Ascalaphus harbored himself the longest beneath the tree gnome village. Frend was doing the tuna potato from scratch and needed the aid of a culinary master, so I cooked his sweetcorn for him.

We remembered the most recognized players Zezima and sue me and conversed about the Jagism manifesto and updates to come. An over full table of hot meals was served, then we jumped into the gym for an atomic romp in the main combat ring with a new unrivaled power demonstrated by Honey and Mel that led to their nomination for the first team captains in clan wars.

With just a toe dip into honey territory, team Mell was broadsided to defeat by all the loose cannons.

Kasper had somewhat psychically predicted his successes in safecracking in our heist event Sunday with Mighty Davey of you love me.

Ghost would come close, but Davey stayed one step ahead of the law using hypertime to slow us down and out. Kasper lodged his longsword through another effigy of Link to be hallowed with the title of best in blitz. He was bestowed his fifth skillcape in the warriors guild and scorched the sky. The Lord of the Undead Sin Vicious shrouded himself in the petilent woods outside of Meiryerditch for the longest consistent time of the event on Monday, an hour and twenty minutes. For a change of aroma, I found a good fishing spot outside the Fremmenik Village. Shinato found me there, and decided that his Ruby should be next.

Fame Miss Mell of the Zeerack Kingdom, a staunton chess version proficient, was my partner for the conquest variant in two consistent games after an introduction and re-adjustments to glitches and lag.

The mage was inescapable, but the battle cry of a knight was stronger. I happened on Ascalaphus in the refuge of a remote cave containing a former fire making land strip.

We penetrated their meager defenses and firmly planted the kiss of death to retire them, for some satisfaction and a slight increase in demand for premium droppings.

When I returned, Sin taught me the Pokey stick moves that were more effective in preventing bots' teleportation.

A z n and Sin each gained a level, and siphoning cosmic ess-hounds turned out to be A z en's daily challenge.

She then held a harmonic mass bonanza on the land next to the bank. In the quiet zone of Fal-adore Park on Sunday, we broke a wee bit of old bread with Mighty King Davey of you love me and tossed it off at our web toed waterfowl friend.

The mighty had fallen wielding a red sword. We met demand with another round, this time felicitous Queen Catty and Hawk, Brute, and Rodger of The Social Code contended with us.

The longest battle in wilderness History ended with Soul as the victor. Bot hunter Icarus Slays was recruited to the clan when we reunited briefly with Davey and Atlis at Forinthry Dungeon for revenant razing. A random guy watched me die.

Davey and I designed and built new spaces in our estates for the purpose of housing 25 thousand gallon exotic sea creature collections and displaying nautical decorations. The You Love Me King quickly accumulated a large variety of fish within the first few days of the addition. He complimented my Sea Weed farm. I met a mysterious vested man at the Pick and Lute bar. Davey came to the library in no more than eight minutes and fifty four seconds. I stopped in the Yanille Pest store with Athena on the way. Frend and Sin visted me in Edge Reformatory. Ruby stayed at the Shilo Village resort with Rift and Lay. We entered the instant shard world again to enjoy the challenging game play and added bonus rewards and justice against cheaters in Cabbage Punch Saga with beloved Allies You Love Me King Davey and Bugle Boy of Ye Old Pub on Tuesday.

Unassuming virtuoso Zeerackian Mockingbird mustered a small cluster of plowers having sufficient understanding and experience to restore ecological balance in the city of Fal-adore with Biggy and You Love Me King Davey on Friday. The power ranger targeted the intangible bouncing female antagonist with avengence. It roared with pain like a lion as we impaled it, causing it to explode. You Love Me King Davey stars opposite of Rift and Lay Dotter as the unlikely hero supported by Social Code Queen Catty in a space western. After facing excessive military force while living on the fringe of society, a renegade rebel encounters immortal blue aliens who terrorize the neighboring towns. With the help of mystical beings, a legendary weapon, and turn based fighting styles he must seal their fate to return home. The Trickster and the Drunkard Blues is a message of broadmindedness. Many deep baritone voices suddenly cried out in terror and were silences by Frend. He shot a magic blast right through the center of Sneaky Fish's chest to a nine footer to be hailed a great defender and bestowed the perception of status with a shoulder padded cloak on Saturday. We were guided into the mystics camp with awesome allies by Zeerackian matriarch Pokey Lee and Mandalorian Lain. Dwelling in the contemplative dimension, we glazed the unbroken colorless surface in complete harmony and constant pleasure. My thumb had a penta phalagral tendency. Fierce Nors warriors and awesome ally forces prepared to travel to the kharidian desert to suppress the Kalphite uprising. A gang of four made the pilgrimate and recieved a warm welcome from the king. We took turns provoking him to incur his wrath and he dispensed rounded rocket discharges and expendable adherents with insidious efficiency. Though many lives were lost, we sustained our rate of fire and came back crazier. The giant kalphiscarabeinae was captured and killed. We wheeled and dealed with prominent players Zeerackian Fame Miss Mell and You Love Me King Davey to accumulate wealth and power on Sunday. General Rift apprehended a purple bandit in Burthrope. Disguised as a school teacher in an ill fitting sleeveless shirt, she snatched a box. The female warrior got her junk. A palladin had fallen and he would be no priest. In vyrewatch, two smooth regal vampires were unscrupulous raiders. A troublesome 12 year old boy was caught stealing. Princess Jasmine got cut in Al Kharid. All the guards were decieved by the sorceress. Hoping to clear our consciences, we enlisted and rised through the ranks. Coby and I found Lain staring across at the heart shaped lakeshore by Sin Cair Mansion on Monday. Severed hands crawled about on their own in crystal lake cave, then Lain and Biggy came. Lain Found Biggy set in stones. Fame Miss Mell formed a specialized squad in Burthrope to investigate the global Penguin threat to mankind. We explored and found arctic birds in a variety of different locations most especially in the desolate kharidian desert lands and inpenetrable jungles of Karamja. Rift and I went into BUrthrope on Tuesday in search of recruits. Brajjanovic and K mathis joined us. Four super powers deployed into the scourged expanse last night and consolidated resources to develope the best possible arsenals. Tensions came to a head in a regional war 20 minutes in following the defeat of random bots and p k ers. Counselor Cherry deliberately surrendered to Rift belieiving in assured destruction.

In simplicity at its finest on World 3 with Angel Soul, we were in direct conflict with a gang of non stop killers led by Hollywood punks Faux Hijack and Humorous on Friday. Despite considerable and persistent troubles, we gradually and with the help of Lucy's friend incapacitated and sent them back to the source. Lopez returned. At sunrise on Saturday, we tested our resolve with unmatched warrior skills sparring in the gym with Zoomy Uchiha and relentless Pure of the Nation of Skillers. A massive line of players camped out on Lumbridge Crater expecting a big pewie. Mod Balance appeared and let it rip, enveloping the crowd. Three distinct knowledge seekers returned to make a steep descent into the flaming tombs of violent and malicious souls and apparitions emulating mythical wind goats. Mighty King Davey of You Love Me juggled multiple roles and used elaborate disguises. Sin Vicious and Amen Lucifer came forth as captains in a rare instance of a P V P event on a Sunday. High foreign intermediary Izami helped plot destruction in the forsaken quarry. I stood at the door and recieved death. We quickly evaporated on the Death Plateau. With the addition of Sin on Team Lucy, against Team Rift Soul, we had the grandest form of retribution. In the rematch they grilled us well. I recovered Trixy at the fantastic capital of the Arthurian Realm next door to Seers Village on Monday. I continued training with Hazlemere when twilight was upon him until Fame Miss Mell came. I found Miss Mells frozen remains scattered in the snowy region of Relleka. With our close partner Davey, we operated against the K B D with agression, destabalizing its internal processes and supporting its isolationist tendency to expand power in Edgeville on Tuesday. Having the desire to obtain twice as much and introduce more geo-political disorder, we crawled into the exiled hive not expecting a signifigantly more difficult Kalphite sister with the power to continually dispense expendable adherents, even in death. Lucy and I died, but our P V M lives were saved by Rift. Lay Dotter hyper jumped when she saw a get well party for her organized by Rift with the support of awesome Zeerackian ally ministers Lain and Mell in the volcanic city yesterday. Rift also offered himself formally to permanent union with Lay Dotter. We played in the pits and ended up kicking each other around with sweaty socks controlled by Rift's magic in increments. Everyone got hot wind at least once. Davey, King of You Love Me and current Lord of the Wilderness gave me a tour of his well maintained extravagant dwelling remodeled to accomodate guests and administration. We shared some ideas for further additions. We have met timber, stone, and precious bar upkeep goals in the sitadell. We need more metal bars and cloth. Kaby is this ticks first capper.

The hour of the amazing Countess' return from absence since February had come when New Order went underground with You Love Me King Davey on Friday, ceasing our worries. She spoke of the encumberance that had been keeping her away and an important decision. On divine grounds, our attention was drawn to Daemonheim with Zeerackian Princess Honeysuckle. We were pulled under the icy roaring remains of the ancient castle and laboured through the deep place assailed by outcast sufferers and accursed spirits held in bondage. The journey was made on Saturday. We joined Miss Hary 5 8 5 of Cruelty in the fight against the devilish commander K'ril Tsuaroth and his officers corps. Unforseen supportive drop in Azure offered to facilitate this cause privately, leading to more success with some legacy experimentation suggested by the Amazing Countess. Kaby prepared the way for Trail and I to navigate safely through a winding ountain to the ruins of an ancient temple. Trail was backed into a corner of the stronghold having quickly exhausted his swordfish supply in the sweep of brutish devotees. Frend delivered aid. Finally, with Lopez we debarred and crushed the remnant ourg commander. Frend was surprisingly agressive from his initiation of the first attack in conquest on Sunday. He made necessary sacrifices and took advantage of my mistakes. With charge and battle cry, my champion was the victor. Leading off with a crossfire in our second rematch, Zeerackian Fame Miss Mell eliminated the most dynamic units with a prudently active defense. My equally powerful champion had only a minor foot soldier to back him up if he failed. I used battle cry. I met with Sin at the Southern Entrance of Yanille agility dungeon on Monday. Rift found me before sun down, hanging around musicians and dancers sojourning at the court of Citharede Abbey. Chong and I gained greater insight divining bright wisps by the digsite, racing against the machines in the guthixian cache to deliver exclusive clean and refreshing bottled water to the surface, and grabbing nest eggs. Amazing Countess A Z N and beloved Queen Lady Bev were captains for three team battles with Zeerackian P V P Champions, You Love Me Royal Soldiers, and Fierce Nors Warriors in the classic arena. We were overpowered on team Bev though we were determined to rise three feet above.

I re-entered the exiled Kalphite lair with Rift and awesome Zeerackians, overseen and facilitated by Jad we raided the lair of the Kalphiscarabeinae with our rifles and grenades, to fight and die until he was laid upon the floor on Friday. New Order held a harmonic mass bonanza in the land next to Burthrope bank. We were eventually joined by Mighty King Davey of You Love Me and local reveller Tanya Marie, who was recruited to the clan. I danced close with the Amazing Countess. In the well maintained extravagant dwelling of Davey, remodeled again, we reflected on observations and concepts for the proliferation of the Runescape Community. Kaby's consciously connected butterfly made of flame demonstrated telekinetic shield stripping abilities. Zirak Kingdom's allies the Kingdom of Saradomin hosted Saturday's Castle Wars event on World 82. I was erratic in combat positions, breaking down obtruders and going out for convalescence. Opponents were most impressive, with some tenacious engagements spanning nine hours on Saturday. Both teams were triumphant. Sin and Ruby Shinato came to Lumwood Manor. We set in the throne room and they shared personal experiences and eduacated me in the world's hottest spices. Ruby toured the Sitadell's newest prospect with Izami and Kaby, a mall on battlefield c with large and small sized stores. We got in under the surface for two short adventure modes finding an increased number of totems and pocket monster cards in sinkholes with Zeerackains Fame Miss Mell and P v P champion Delta, and Rainbow Syndicate Leader Mister Boy. I was rewarded with 83 Dungeoneering. New Order's alliance with Rainbow Syndicate was officially established. As cabbage punch remains exclusively on an instant shard world, our event was spent with a mixed bag of regulars and the added bonus of punching them as well as a good time with our new ally. Papa R O T C, the self righteous cheater king remains a favorite target. I came to visit Rykean as he spend the night in the room above the General Store on Monday. I found myself in a temple besieged by bots with Rykean. By reason of the pest controlled island being spotlighted, Mandalorian Lain made plans for an assault. Zeerackains preoceeded in the invasion with Nors and Mighty King Davey of You Love Me, following up with formation changes when necessary to safeguard the guy in the dress while sealing the portals. I discovered something a miss in the Dragonkin ruins of Brimhaven on Tuesday. Frend slayed black demons. I was hired as a part time lab assistant in a privately owned buisness offering 24 hour scientific services. Trail walked in as I briefly closed my eyes. We dueled for sport at the arena yesterday with Zeerackian Fame Miss Mell. I learned to never underestimate the powers of the countess and had two fair melee duels with Rift, winning the first. Miss Mell was still unmatched with the scythe in her hands. I didn't have the chance to beat Frend. We have met timber, stone, and precious bar upkeep goals in the sitadell. We need more metal and cloth. Frend is this ticks first capper. Nors Updates 86: The Ninja team has made several tweaks and fixes to make distractions and diversions more accessible and rewarding.

I waltzed with Royal strawberry princess Kit of You Love Me in Taverly on Friday. She is recovering from physical injuries in an accident. In Edgeville, I caught up with the exhausted amazing countess Azn, who had been taking care of her little sister. I learned that earlier that day she had been scammed 37 million by a person named Kill Insect. They're on the hit list now. A Z N has started recuperating thanks to the help of clanmembers reservoir general rift and new recruit Legge 20. A Z N and I fell into Necropolis with the awesome Zeerackians knowlingly executing the secret plans of a sorcerer, making a game of it for two successions as it had been spotlighted on Saturday. I followed Biggy to slaughter flame afflicted fiends. We engaged the armies to the west, took away a third of their population, and advanced into their enclave for collapse of the avatar. A Z N and I faced the predicament of divided loyalties. I gave Lain a tour of the recently build clan Mall. He described it as trippy and comparable to market days when clans ran cities. Rykean and I went deep into the wilderness to restore balance by defeating the chaos elemental. A random unarmed guy came to die, then Rykean was gunned down by a drive by pker, just after a week of recovering from amnesia and a rash. I fought to the death. We crawled under the mud in Lumbridge swamp driven to claim wealth and power for five minutes. We played the hands we were dealt. The Nors, Zeerackian Fame Miss Mell, and Azn's friend Death Birdy came over to Lumwood manor on Sunday for a the Amazing Countess' wizard's duel with Kaby. The lady of the manor took the surveyors life with ice and achieved the highest degree of sorcery. We went to the city of the wizards and Azn was adorned with her first shoulder padded cloak. Azn and I headed to the lair of the K G B to encourage seperatism. Rift met us and re-facilitated the cause privately. We ran it down and seized ownership of immense properties. Rift led a brisk excursion of the levels marked by immersion in ice and forgotten warriors in the deepest isolation. We barely struggled against the spiritual forces and did as Cicero said. Sin rescued a Wookie trapped in the walls of Falador on Monday. On a hunting trip, Queen Catty found Sin's r o f l copter crashed in the jungle. I stood upon the sand of the dig site by the remains of a large horned beast and Mellopy came and spake to me. She said come to world 60 Burthrope. Following a mission briefing from Fame Miss Mell, with the Zeerackians we found killer gentoos evaluating assets in Zanaris and Fenkenstein's Castle, Solo patrolling Yanille and Ardougne, and vacationing on waterfalls and caribean islands. My elf city research can progress thanks to the help of Lain. You Love Me Royals and I dropped to the mid depths of Daemonheim with their new member Slash to search for truth in the imperceptible degradation guarded by malicious spooks and cryptic puzzles. A Z N was the whiz of the Barbarian Assault cooperative with Bugle of Ye Olde Pub on Tuesday, as old time veterans returned and we adapted to atypical positions in the basement taking on the penance. We made it to level four. Setsuhen and Rykean followed me into the scourged expanse last night. I revealed resource locations to them during the extended consolidation time including rune rocks, the furnace, and anvil. We were for the most part encased before Rift was ready. A mysterious meteorite fell to the earth as we were cooking. Setsu and I tracked Rykean down to the eastern church and attacked. he used old tricks to get away and Rit retaliated with curses. I used smite to effectively exhaust his prayer points until he recharged at the altar. he prevented me from recharging mine and killed me where I stood. Rift weakened Setsu for a more balanced fight between here and Rykean. Reich stuck her with a poison blade and ran away alot using magic until he succumbed to the live giving shield style in the hands of Setsu. With remaining life points and fishies setsu and rift faced off. Rift was the victor. We have met timber, stone, precious bar, and cloth goals for upkeep in the sitadell. We need more metal bars.

Fronted by the unassuming virtuouso Mockingbird, formerly known as Jad and Sophisticated Queen Krisimay awesome Zeerackians and fierce Nors Chiefs would further cement their legacy by running a rampage through the pilgrim's settlement and silencing Saradomin's second self. We were on high alert for an off-hand saradomin crossbow. The tenacious struggle awarded two million gold splits. I did not realize my action bar was set to range in the first few coups and learned from Jad that my gloves and hat lowered my accuracy. I was torn away by a random vortex and sent around the sun to a different Gielenor in a parallel universe early in the fifth age and found Emma at the Lumbridge Castle bank. We went on a seemingly endless promenade and were almost robbed before meeting the gender bender who changed Emma from a bald and burly lumberjack to a lady. She recieved an extensive makeover in Falador and Varock, and was fitted with bronze armor at the grand exchange. We went South of the Duel Arena in Al Kharid to refine combat skills mechanically in free for all. Returning from a supposed failed assasination attempt, U Ded Pray was Princess Honeysuckle's aid for the day on Saturday, while two teams of Zeerackian Allies and Nors explored a bizarre plane and gathered a likely toxic material while forming personal connections peacefully. Matty Worrier remains the most successful. Austin of You Love Me brought offerings of Dragon Bones and prayed to Guthix. For Rykean and Setsu's tall bout, I hid the Emerald treasire within the stone circle guarded by dark wizards. Setsu deciphered the hints and claimed the prize. The void knight outpost was spotlighted for conquest on Sunday. Zeerackian Fame Miss Mell arranged for a joint event three hours earlier, resulting in one of the largest turn outs for it that Gielenor had seen in some time, with Elven Lain, Felicitous Queen Catty of The Social Code, You Love Me Mighty King Davey, and Nors Black Ops Kurama. Each game was not witout its challenges. Queen Catty performed with Cat like focus and great agression for her first time. She had a good share of men. I played a rematch with Fame Miss Mell testing the reliability of her new formation which was more mystifying than our last with soldieries advancing from directly inverse directions and excessive movement. Kurama commanded a most intimidating, unsurpassable power with a squad of only champions and knights. Many men died for scanty strikes to prove it was possible to win. Fame Miss Mell added a mage and some superior commands in anoter rematch. She was a verified stalwart grinding down almost every man including my champion. With battle cry, my halberder defeated her champion and won. Lain lost all of his commands except regenerate for no discernable reason, So i used mine with more moderation. He played well with that and it only being his second game. We crowded around Ssour with Davey as he punched goblins to death and became a master of attack with fists of fury. Tanya came to meet him as Kurama walked down to the beach on Monday. Tanya asked why Quercus was so sad when I came to Edgeville. Elsie Parks reccounted tales of Dionysius and Freddie to me and Tanya. The light poured into a happy garden in the center of the vault of war where I found Duex. Kurama and I got inside the head of a fantastical film maker. He found gene in the monastary of a seedy run down town. Kurama invited me to his storage cellar to enjoy a lifetime supply of pork and beans. Fierce Nors Warriors, Awesome Zeerackians, and Beloved You Love Me King Davey landed on the back of the boar like goddess expecting to make their way to Tuskas weak points to deliver greater total damage as a group. Unfortunately the system was broken, so we jumped to the starting island together. Davey and I drowned tentacle growths with fire, penetrated souls in the spirit realm, climbed by crystal, mined cheese rocks, grew mysterious herbs, and calmed a storm before running up the tusks and skewering the pork. Having learned how to use the grouping system through rykeans demonstration, we were able to instantaneously transport clan members and allies to the remote cave yesterday. I was severely wounded by Biggy and took flight to the well sheltering myself for a moment in a green blazing shack until capture. Biggy had everything, precision, panache, pace, and power. He took a bashing. I was beaten by my wife. She was my target and my aim was true. It was hard to kill her. Dragon Kurask started a group for a Tuska Drive. The System was still broken, so we jumped to the island together again. The Countess and I went on a cosmic trip, channeling our energies, warming up a spaghetti breakfast, sowing seeds, and gaining insight. We shot up the hog with our allies. We have reached all upkeep goals in the sitadell. We can begin collecting for tier 6. Frend is this ticks first capper.

With the month long mission to break the boar's bridle to Gielenor continuing and not declining in favor, we rode the storm to balance on its back on Friday. You Love Me Mighty King Davey and I were a dynamic duo breaking crystals easy, cutting the cheese, jumping into graves, and gaining experience in electrical engineering and space botany. We shot Tuska in the head. Zeerackian Matriarch Pokey Lee revived the Wizard Tower Research Centre's principal project on Saturday with Princess Honey, True Range Master Avenged Ruler, and S C Champion Matty Worrier. The repell wand was actually more advantageous for redirecting orbs as both teams took part cooperatively without competition. There was a green Honey and a yellow Emerald. Reservoir General Rift facilitated a Nors communal hunt of a fiendish giant dog, with Lopez along for the first time. We sufficiently hindered the horned beast's vision and put it down continuously in its fixed affliction. Lopez and I were casualties and extorted by the Grim Reaper in many lives. A trip to the game center was in favor on Sunday. I played the most impressive games of Rune link with arc angel and Soul, almost filling the grids. I was more successful in force take checkers, wearing out the spirit of soul. Frend got Duex out of Falconry class by Piscatoris on Monday. I thought I saw Frend working out on the beach in bikkini with gloves. He met me at the fight arena bar for finger food and pepsi. Dancing mania broke out on the New Order Sitadell floor. We took to fervently dancing collectively with Beloved You Love Me Queen Lady Bev and Merciful gift in celebration of our host, Kaby, who is moving from Australia to New Zealand soon. The surveyor had killer moves. He and High foreign intermediary Izami had an epic rap battle. We made gluten free toasts. Continuing the celebration, we made our way to free for all safe clan wars, where we were joined by Mighty King Davey of You Love Me and World 53 citizen woodsgirl. We wrestled with fierce Nors Warriors and You Love Me Royal Soldiers, and A Z N helped me get my mojo back. Miss Woodsgirl called us for backup as she took on the K G B. She would later join the clan. We gathered at the clan camp with Davey. In order of rank, we tossed our bouqets as far as we could for whoever would catch them for random partner selection. Kurama and I were sent to claim the lives of ancient sea dwellers. We were pretty fast. W were also given the task of hunting down and killing iron dragons to extinction. Yesterday I went on a hunting trip with Zeerackian True Range Master Avenged Ruler and Princess Honey, who was armed to the teeth with big guns and wearing ballistic armor. We shot some birds and took on the big game despite the change in weather. I died. The Grim Reaper only charged 37 k for protection. I have a month of membership and more time to gather logs thanks to Duex. Castle wars just happened to be spotlighted when we went there for our event which was the first official one with us for Miss Woods and Miss Tanya's first experience with the game. The blue team was Duex, Tanya, and Myself. A Z N and woods were the defense on the red team with Kaby capturing in the first and Lopex in the second. Instead of defending, everyone on the blue team attempted to capture the red standard to no avail due to the overpowering safeguard. The Amazing Countess killed everyone and the red team was ahead by at least 5 points in both games. The efforts, strategies, and promptness of both teams was impressive.

You Love Me Mighty King Davey and I were called to the Kharidian desert to help Zeerackians deal with a big problem on Friday. Wearing a cool vest, unassumng virtuouso Mockingbird opened a gateway to the abomination to annihilate. I wielded my katana and witheld the life giving shield style, yielding more success than I initially expected by reason of my lower attack and strength, though I bit the dust twice. I was substitute voker for a minute. Davey, The Social Code Felicitous Queen Catty Watty, and tenderfoot Tanya crossed the threshold into the scourged expanse. While gathering for consolidation and battling hostile dwellers, I pickec up a skeleton champion scroll Zeerackians Fame Miss Mell and True Ranged Master Avenged Ruler told me about. I was fully outfitted and readied with a secret weapon, an offhand dagger when I went head to head with Davey. Alternating between shield and dual weapon style, I dealt a considerable amount of damage before my defeat. Catty fell asleep and Davey and Tanya were unable to fight at the deepest point of the Wilderness. For the first time, the game ended in a drawl. Davey and I dueled to the death with longswords. Nors and allies crowded around Kurama in Lumbridge as he killed goblins in three different ways for three simultaneous masteries in magic, range, and defense. Castle Wars remained highlighted on Saturday. Awesome Zeerackians and fierce Nors Warriors ovveran given territories with healthy and vigorous destruction by order of Princess Honeysuckle. I was of the infantry, upgraded from Guthic Dragonhide to Karil's with some help from P V P champion Biggy. I used the same shield abilities and some melee on top of my range. I was at least fair and more potent than I was in battle with Kree'ara. The Amazing Countess and her assistant Piney were given a first time techincal briefing of bi-weekly sweepstakes. A Z N challenged me for a venti bout. Piney, Frend, and Shadow Seal watched as we fought to two ties in a row. In the third and final go, she beat me and claimed the prize. We were brought to the mystics camp on Sunday for a highlighted series of Stealing Creations games with Zeerackians and The Social Code hosted by Fame Miss Mell and Elven Laina Dan.

I teamed up with Queen Catty and her squad to pursue and exterminate angry mobs of demons spawning around the world and laying siege to local villages. Catty lost a life during the fight.

Legge ascended the staircase and discovered Rift was in LEage with dark sorcery. Lain caught Legge before he could flee to cover in a Spider hole in Piscatoris. I traversed the bridge over skeleton canyon to Lain at the entrance to Kinshra Fortress. While chopping ivy in preparation for harvest time with New order, Fame Miss Mell, and Bugle on Sunday, a mysterious meteorite hit the ground by Rift and drew him closer.

Honey flowed through the arena and drove me with adrenaline I needed to possess. I could no longer guard my dreams and visions. P V P champion Biggy had me trapped. He accellerated and killed me as he ate up the pep. I couldn't overcome it, I drank the wine of Golsin's fury in full strength. He used his sorcery to divert me and I cut him off. I rose up behind sweet ice and chased her like a leopard, and exhausted her spirit. She beat my head against thhe wall and I got in touch with my natural instincts. I succumbed to carbone monoxide poisoning. Miss Honey had manifested effective control of the life giving shield style and powers beyond my Ken such as perfect timing and freezing at the duel arena. We were overwhelmingly interested in readily available high protein and nutritional benefits of candy coated insects and concentrated on the Cow fight king. The music changed and Reservoir General Rift played a game of conquest with me on Sunday while delegating completion of tasks. He was increasingly potent towards the end especially in handling his champion. Before sunrise, we stepped behind the scenes to see Legs, the new head of the curatorial department at the world class museum. Life in edgeville progressed comfortably. I gave Davey applicable information. Dave advertised the most effective lures and bairs at the Lumbridge fishing store. Kasper stopped at the visitor center for in depth information at the attraction straddling the border. He kept up with Legs at the cutting edge dwarven comlex. Miss Peppers was a remarkably dressed busy client and sensed power in the fingers of the hairdresser. Legs transitioned to a strange charcter where perceptual contrary forces were interrelated. Kas recued Rift from the second story of an unoccupied crumbling house on Monday. We seeked to rid the influence of a demonic prescence in an ancient temple and attempted to burn the general of the legion has he slept. We lifted the curse with spiritual weapons and fortitude on Tuesday. We maintained the balance with a sincere effort against the warriors of light we confronted and vanquished. Nothing could seperate us from Guthix. Abnormal round eyed disturbances occured. We plunged into the dark pit of the tribal society with awesome Zeerackain allies p v p champion Biggy and Latty Sutton also Known as Sweet Ice. We moved all over the warzone in full operation against all things terrible and horrendous in nature while Miss Setsu learned and Kasper dealt with technical difficulties. The cyclopian slugs lives were nothing but a vapor. Lightning fell and yesterday was a day of reckoning. We were commited to a painful providence in the dark side of eternity with You Love Me Mighty King Davey. We endlessly endured scorching heat that inspired sufficient manic physical hostility to extinction. Then the light of the lamp shined. Upon the beach Lay Dotter the bear reached the relevant experience for a masters degree in alternative medicine.

After mining a crashed star, Nors, Felicitous Queen Catty of The Social Code, and Ye Olde Pub Patron Bugle saw Established spellcaster In You possess heightened magical power and a second skill cape on Friday. We had taken up residence for the night at our alternative headquarters, the jet black turn of the century architectural treasure imported from San Francisco with dreams of investments in paper hats. No one could stop the bath of blood from the heavy blows landed in our intense sparring and boxing matches. The generals demonstrated and impressed. Zeerackian elf Lainadann had been in the top one thousand miners since the night before. I took passage aboard a wonderful vessel with Zeerackians, captained by Princess honeysuckle and first mate Poki-Lee to see where we could take it. Our ship filled with water and sank. We just barely eluded the jaws of sharks on Saturday. Zeerackian Peevee emer Avenged Ruler had gone to great lengths and faced substantial hardship to extract the virtual level of 120 and have the true mastery cape of mining in his hands. Legs embarked on a depth defying adventure of pure excitement to recover the Emerald Treasure from the breathtaking cliffs of an incredible province. He generously returned it. I entered the instant shard world with new clan member Nami x on Sunday. We shook things up fighting ignorance literally and frantically surrounding and collapsing the vindictive out of touch abusers one by one. Izami Uchiha was pre-occupied with working as a blacksmith's apprentice at the sword shop in Varock. Lord Hakumen followed me into the basement of Count Victor Draynor Drakan's mansion lit by romantic candelight and decorated with human skulls. Haku stood at the snowy area of trollweis mountain near the entrance to Keldagrim with the wind blowing. Sin Shinato took action by occupying the bank, eager for change to help him prosper on Monday. Ye Olde Pub Patron Bugle Boy became more enduring and sustainable. It was thought that he learned how to save himself from death. We gathered at the clan camp with You Love Me King Davey and Ye Olde Pub patron Bugleboy. Bugle tossed his bouquet first as far as he could throw it. It was caught by Grim, making him his partner, and Davey mine. Davey and I combined to create tides looking for something liquid to pour out in a mystical place in the history of human culture. Our divine sense of curiousity absorbed us into the Brimhaven Dungeon where we washed away the scourge of greater demons and their elite. We conceptualized new mobs and abilities as we began to understand the way we think and connect with the world on Tuesday. It was seen by fierce Nors Warriors, You Love Me Mighty King Davey, and The Angels of Perdition, that Field Tzar General Zorak further established himself as a combat elite. At the destruction of Rift and myself, he simultaneously mastered defense, attack, and strength yesterday. The team fc battle fell under the supervision of black ops assistant Zoomy and Angels of Perdition guest of Tacos. Without question, the slightly outnumbered team taco bell began with a defensive formation and attempted to carry out an order of attack when the opposition pursued. Team Zoomy siezed control at an accelerated rate and had led the full scale conflict by 25 to 17. We have reached all upkeep goals in the sitadell except metal bars.

Fabulous Entoy was finally initiated as a Mage and Farmer on Friday. Grimey demonstrated poroper forge manipulation and fabrication of metal for Entoy to begin resource capping. Inu and I planned a most satisfying adventure in the national heritage area of Falador on Saturday. Miles deep, we acted to prevent violent crimes against society by whipping Maria Mole ourselves to a spongey consistency and mixing it with nuts and honey to serve. I helped orchestrate a bomb explosion to awak a sleeping giant with The Social Code's Queen Catty Watty and Darksith 130. The Enraged Our hurled the nearest guards at us, which were easily crushed. We hit him several times managing to cut his life short and escape. Dark gained 100 combat and 77 defense. We recieved generous 170k cuts on Sunday. Queen Cattygave us a tour of her estate with an alluring under water gallery of one of the broadest constituences of fish I had seen yet, a natural landscape enhanced by cast stone fountains, a prominent reserve for exotic animals to graze in, and an art collection that must have cost a mint. She says her design is motivated by house parties. We fell below her trap door to a firey oubliette and fought her demon. Sweet Princess Honeysuckle and Zeeratcher winded up an atomic surge of stunning head to head battles with Zeerackians and You Love Me King occupying the territory west of the lake of impurities on Monday. I kept slipping, and struggled to keep the pace facing a barrage of undeniable quality from the fighters, challenging the credibility of the life giving shield style. Davey and I escaped with the princess to the Honey Comb and tossed our weapons to throw punches to the death. Boxing gloves were more effective than bare knuckles in the excessive brutal three way romp of prized fighters. Legs took up training as a salesman at Oziach's house in Edgeville. We enjoyed the warm day out fising on Lumbridge beach. Hee stayed at Morgan's house in Draynor for a day or two composing himself for what was ahead. We heard the voice of Miss Peppers calling into the dark and started to run into the trees to find her. Legs saved me from a pit of scorpions. I went to the docks of Taverly to see Legs off before he took the last ship to leave for the Undying Lands. Peppers and I met our old friend Kasper down by the river to go on a ride in a rowing boat. At dawn I matched weapons with Frend to violently settle a non-dispute in a far more civilised way. He had the satisfaction of validating his gift in ranging by winning 3 out of five brawls with it including one stakeed. He generously returned the money. New Order adminstered a persisten social experiment on a mass audience to inform decisions and alter subjects mental states to a measureable effect on Tuesday. Princess Honeysuckle altered the course to resume a relentless well prepared assault against the fish heads with Zeerackians, You Love Me, and Nors. We were too strong for the stupendous monsters. With heavy fire power, we subverted them and the balancer reaped their souls yesterday. Musclemen of New Order shot into the virtually unsettled rough terrain and tore through their surrondings collecting resources. Mister A F K was cut down by Legs. Louder intercepted me at the wilderness volcano and we launched into a fierce fight. Speed was the essence. We exhausted our food supply. I stablelized by taking advantage of the life giving shield style and held on long enough to overpower him. With low health, I was resigned to an impending death. Legs was recognized as the new Lord of The Wilderness. We have reached all upkeep goals in the sitadell except metal bars. We need more of them.

We danced the night in Lumwood manor celebrating the passing of summer and the upcoming extravagance to look forward to with You Love Me King Davey on Friday. We discussed these various topics in the irreplaceable huge space. Fabulous Entoy announced his acceptance in to nursing school. In full uniform, we sped off into the wilderness with dedication and passion for an oily assault on bots. Grim was attacked by a p kayer indirectly aiding the bots. The convoy siezed the outlaw Follo Follo and almost killed him. Davey and I joined forces with hostess Princess Honeysuckle for cabbage punch saga with favorable atmospheric conditions. There were fewer than average agressive cheaters and I gained more points. When I was fairly transformed into a gorrilla, Graphiqal rolled with the punches instead of flipping out on Saturday. I buried the Emerald Treasure and left it in the protective custody of the sisters and troubajdour outside the citharede abbey. Charlie devoted time to a search and reclaimed it. Ideologically motivated by growing concern about the spread of the Saradominist totalitarion state, Rift, Kasper, and I shared the goal of ending the pilgrimage and gained control of the area by all possible means. We defeated the cult hiearchy and got pieces of warpriest armor on Sunday. Miss Peppers and I left for a satisfying revolutionary transformation in the northeast and identified a common macro with auto retaliate on. It was the one that got away. The machines had taken over that day. Legs used a variety of every day objects extensively to split and collapse giant blood sucking genetic freaks on Monday. We enjoyed the innocence of the setting and tore the roof off at the river village. Haku and I traveled to Eagle's Peak to procure the elusive Legs. I took a route through the busy streets and arrived in the alleyway where the murders occured. Haku's sparkly gold armor shined with the energy of sun rays. We left town to perform forbidden magical transmutation of spirit into matter. Hakus surfaced on the rocky shore with creative ambitions. We were mindful of the excesses that ruined a whole nation and were not shaken by any of the recent disturbing events. We made an astonishing journey below, painstakingly recreating and utilizing the existing structure while fighting for the liberation and alleviation of suffering for the captured with disciplined performance on Tuesday. We roamed far west to our alternative headquarrts and were greeted by the You Love Me King, Kaby, and Soul, who we invited to stop by. The festivities were interrupted by an impending disaster. We poured over the valleys in a roundabout scuffle that wouldn't slow down. We were heroes in age of none. We intercepted and the blue side had the flag thrice to the red's four. They used fresh tactics to retrieve it and take over our exclusice high rise. With no time to spare Davey and I attempted one last capture. We rolled back into the valleys with My A Z N. She and I were on the red team. She had the confidence, control and distracting new outfit to drive results. We took a stand but our resistence was tied up in overwhelming odds. I fully realized that I should make an effort to land the flag. We have reached all upkeep goals in the sitadell except metal bars. We need more of them. This ticks first capper is Setsuhen.

Entoy guided us through his pastoral fertile property with an evergreen for every month of the year, a large scale non-industrial private forest for smoking, useful functioning portals, and deeply personal secluded rooms on Friday. Zeerackians, Nors, and friends fully enjoyed a meaningful woodland inspired backyard romantic occasion at Mellopy's mansion. Ministers Fame Miss Mell and Elven Lainadann were forever united as one in the name of almighty Guthix that night. The reception was playtime in the expansive dungeon catering to differing tastes. We responded to an emergency call and forced entry into the occupied dwelling of the lizard vermin, the K G B to regain control and establish a sustainable program with our new friend Miss Kreativity on Saturday. It was viable, and as nature intended. We reached for the skies with a laundry list of dreams. When we arrived in Burthrope, a blacksmith was detained. Struggling female veteran's benefits were restricted. School teachers escaped blame for horrific crimes. A disgraced former officer was caught and convicted of smuggling in Al Kharid. His low lying father, who vowed to seek vengeance was pursued and brought to justice. A purple bandit was continually fleeing. She eventually outmaneuvered us and escaped by water on Sunday. My dream came true when I won a most desired object from Balthazar's raffle. I'll shine like gold when I p v p with my new Dharok's set. The You Love Me Royals invited me to their Fremmenik lodge for a delicious meal of stew and Pepsi. We submerged to Davey's underwater city where he controls all the fish and aquatic life in Gill-lenore. A Spooky beacon welcomed the operation services of Entoy and Shadow boy at the highest point on Monday. Having adequately straightened things out, I took a break and stretched on the spot surrounded by banana trees. I rose when I saw Miss Setsu in the distance. She and Entoy teamed up against a herd of undead cows with super bovine strength and agility. I traced Entoy to a smoking homestead in the desert with scattered remains. Shadowboy entertained him near a shipwreck caused by a pirate skirmish. Entoy conducted investigation of a major field located in Draynor and secured Haku behind a storage shed. They were approved for an 18 month intensive training course at Varock Castle. I found Hakus skeleton and clothing in an iron fortress filled with ritualistic magic practitioners. You Love Me Mighty King Davey and I came to terms with the dreams of yesteryear and dived into a vortex. We ambushed our sea adversaries with the King's water controlling powers. The struggle of good versus evil against the elites raged on and we restored calmness. We bridged the faith by putting out the flames of monstrous earth shakers, earning the promised preferential treatment for proving the existence of such creatures on Tuesday. The moon rised in the west draining memories of the sunny sky. The lands were full of bloody crimes and the cities were full of violence. Destruction came suddenly, tearing them apart into three regions. Occupying angry young people dispersed and lashed out compelled to destroy the cosmos. At the time when we hungrily went through the cabbage fields and began to pick some heads to eat, Lord Hakumen and Angelic Soul were subject to embittering experiences of excessive force from law enforcement. We creeped into the crevice of Barbarian village and sacrificed our lives attempting to storm the security stronghold that lay beneath for gold and boots. Unprepared for the coming winter, we were naked and vulnerable in Daemonheim. We sliced through our visit with confrontation in ten seconds flat. With constant vigilance in our midst and means to serve our ends, we were repeatedly motivated to take revenge without lingering in the conflict taking place in the brushwood and high grass yesterday. We have reached all upkeep goals in the sitadell except metal bars. We need more of them.

Awesome Zeerackians, Celestial Angels, and Nors Chiefs left comfort to pursue different paths in a land of savage beauty. There was violence over resources deep in the heart of the wasteland. Miss Osyx was killed by a lone Pee Kayer. Soul got to Davey first and swept him away. I encountered Soul while he was eating and struck him. I was demolished. He and Rift moved on without me and Soul took his turn on Friday. We anticipated an offense and unified to depart for the Pest Controled island on Saturday. We successfully rescued the Void Knight with our tricks and coordinated a defense to remove any vexations that got in the way as we destroyed the particle shield protected portals to deep in the earth, obtaining a major victory. We stayed good until we wanted to relive the experience more provocatively. It was the most confusing of times. Fabulous Entoy became a well rounded advocate of the new combat formula at the duel arena. He and I matched weapons to test his gear. He altered his action bar after the first battle and he was no longer at a disadvantage. Retaining shape by combining the life giving shield style with magic, he was remarkably preserved and rendered my efforts useless. I finally had the oppurtuniy to initiate Rage in the Keep after almost a year on Sunday. I read him a long list of qualifications and he decided on the positions of guide and Black Ops. I attempted to rescue Miss Peppers from the K G B. Utlizing a distinct style, she tapped into vast potential and overcame her trappings. She appeared outside on Monday. I became part of an anti-war protest. When the situation turned violent, I ended up locked in a holding cell with some nice people. Miss Peppers secured my release. Traveling so fast we left a trail of flame behind us, the combined forces of Nors and You Love Me traveled into the remote mountains and invaded the dark fortress with the same dispensation for protectiong humanity as their predecessors. We defeated a small number of the beast's army who could bear to be forgotten. Always stoned and never straight, the general was outpaced and taught life in a violent new way for six iterations by the subconsciously compelled human resistance on Tuesday. We interfered with the workings of fate and our dreams were set a blaze. We were consumed by a soul scorching feverish madness erupting passion for a bloody tradition tearing us limb from limb. We enlisted the aid of the You Love Me Royals who joined in on the fun after celebrating Queen Lady Bev's birthday, in a beautiful act of bravery yesterday. We obtained a wealth of new powers and were simply made of gold. We have reached all upkeep goals in the sitadell except metal bars and precious bars. We need more of them. Nors Updates 104: The ninja team has made intuitive fixes and tweaks to the gear interfaces.

Double x p weekend began at 12 hundred hours u t c, and provided the foundation for ready functioning members to transform. Among the most important contributions were clan members and allies continued achievements of masteries and milestones until Monday at 12 hundred hours. We outlived the illusion and chose to move with a powerful approach when diplomatic relations failed on Friday. We set the wheels in motion against the tyranny of the majority without anything other than total productiveness with good skills like nun chuck and bow hunting skills. I found myself face to face with formidable predators when making the transition got serious. I strengthened my constitution and gained magic as I collected, while most had saved money. New Order, Zeerack Kingdom, You Love Me, and Miss Islan saw me open a magic artefact imbueing me with licensure in the art and science of designing thanks to their help and support on Saturday. Charlie and I crashed on the relatively obscure anima islands with a scheme to resurrect Gill-lenore's dead and prevent creation of a dooms day weapon that would destroy the universe. We returned the spirits seeking rest, grew and recycled funny herbs, terrorized and stalked with god given finesse and clairvoyance, and recognized the ultimate discovery of the chance to change and see the world without a view on Sunday. Entoy put effort into recapturing the glory days by hosting an incredible party at West Varock National bank club on Monday. Entoy and Haku were the signifigant results of just a few outreaches uniting the church. Haku's dream led him to believe that Entoy would be at the entrance to the red temple, and sure enough he was there. They set off to get the swamp back and became respected heroes with an evergrowing collection of friends. Haku caught Entoy about McGrubor's wood during his last days of occupancy. They outdid themselves by dangling in mid air off a second floor balcony in East Ardougne. I liked looking into space at the stars and hoped to play a major role in scientific revolution with improvements to the telescope. Golden Barrows and warpriest brothers joined forces and went the extra mile marching across Gill-lenore from Birththroat to the Grand Exchange bearing a message too important to give up and were recognized. We departed and ran a series of in depth extensions of the local support system in the instant shard world with You Love Me Mighty King Davey on Tuesday. I was flung everywhere and suffered near death by exposure to extreme heat. We evolved into the dominant species and bungled our way through slamming the darn dirty humans with less force than usually applied. Our revolution produced inspiring results. Having turned the world around time after time, thrill seekers of Nors, You Love Me, and The Angels of Perdition, snipped the ribbon to the cave of wonders fair grounds yesterday dedicating skills and knowledge a cut above thaler hanger-ons. I was set back about a thousand years striving to evade Entoy's sphere of influence with the green blazing shacks. A power hurtled through the air and extinguished my problems. It shifted to my hands, resulting in confidence from new found capabilities. Entoy met his demise. We have reached all upkeep goals in the sitadell except metal bars and precious bars. We need more of them. Nors Updates 105: Celebrate national customer service week with daily in game events and social media.

Combine them to create a tradeable token to activate for one that changes every four months, like the crown and cloak. We manifested the property of Lumwood manor which had accomplished its vision thanks to appreciated donations of clanmembers, woven together with a sense of camarederie, and I showcased the scenery and abundance of new decor in the aquarium. We dropped into the dungeon and emptied the space of power and influence of chaotic fiends that swallowed Entoy, which also counted towards daily challenges on Friday. We met at the coffee shop in Edgeville and relocated at the capacity of the K G B seeking to bring him in. A random guy's perspective on public goods and property were against our own. He left leading to big changes. We found the perfect balance. Zeerack Kingdom, Nors and the Angels of Perdition united on the order of P V P Champion Biggy kicking off a massive war to assert sovereignity of the civilian population in a hostile territory. We siezed powerful marbles and returned them to the gneuma shaft granting us immense power. We happily killed for free and died for the perfection of what we pursued. The second round glitched and kicked me out. Nomad was upset for no reason. Entoy challenged me to a Venti bout for sweepstakes. He was incredibly O P with magic and a spirit shield, there was no way around it. I did everything I could. He blasted me down to size and earned his reward. We perfected cognitive flexibility with our awesome allies playing through all the mental games at least once at the historical bailiwick, including the more advanced ones like Runeversi, which we did not remember how to play right away, and Runesquares. For reasons unknown a piece did not move where I clicked during a game of Runelink, which was the favorite on Sunday. I was unashamed of entering the organization and offering Charlie confidential materials containing everything on the prison of belief. The jeweler produced numerous medallions of varying quality from crayola model magic and acryllic paint for us to gift. Kasper was doing the best thing for a planet in a temary star system. I visited Haku at his spacious upper floor apartment in Burthrope. We reconnected with the You Love Me Mighty King Davey and arrived on the Goebie homeworld. We overcame our fears and jumped straight off into close combat with tougher foes to protect the goebies from their unexpected peril in the arena and ended up at the bottom of the pool with a couple of rocks in our pockets. We resurfaced without life jackets and were crushed by measures of mayhem on Tuesday. We subjected ourselves to free for all hand to hand combat east of the lake of impurities Yesterday. We practiced to advance ourselves and better our applications of the distinct advantages of E O C. I introduced Mister one oh four to the life giving shield style. We have reached all upkeep goals in the sitadell except metal bars and cloth. This tick's first capper is Miss Ruby. Nors Updates 106: Play as three great goebie characters solving relaxed puzzles to calming music and trounce the final 10 dialogue boxes and click spam fest for goebie warpaint and weapons, raid loot re-roll ticket, magic xp lamp, and post quest implications in Call of the Ancestors, an enjoyable novice quest with top notch dialogue. It's so totally like a ship in a bottle. The red royals of You Love Me and I traveled across the strange forest unaffected by fear of the elements. We encountered odd and wonderful things and cooked on the corpses of Chaos dwarves. Davey demonstrated expertise with the spear and I accepted the challenge. I was disadvantaged by the heat and thinner atmosphere. One step closer to the edge, the Queen and King of Hearts were entwined in a persistent fight to the death. The Lady swung a stunning victory on Friday. There was a great stir throughout the city of Fal-adore when the sun went down. Four brave men of Nors and You Love Me, who would die to save it, armed themselves and made haste to fight in the dark, side by side for the reinstatement of rigourous security procedures on Saturday. Lethal trick shooter and friend of Miss Kreativity, Kremixx strived to beat his personal records against waterfiends in the ancient cavern. Without missing, he skinned his targeted experience and recieved the cape of unmatched shooters from the armourer at the guild. The re-initiation of A Humble Pie came soon enough on Sunday. We were taken to the special location of the clan sitadell keep, where he expressed his desire to retain his former positions and the process was completed with the inspiring ritual of the oath. Tip and I swayed to a new kind of popular music with Entoy in the elegant and sophisticated Forester's Arms Pub . I was overwhelmed with pressure and withdrew, shunning society. As I stood still waiting for my eyes to adjust, Entoy helped me move out and push through on Monday. New Order and You Love Me commited to handling a minor threat of serious crime effectively implanting blunt objects into flabby cycloeps, crushing them emotionally and stopping them in their tracks with hand strength. My A Z N took good care of me and blew things up like Michael Bay on Tuesday. I assembled with the Ghostriders and Ye Olde Pub and we helped by any means to keep the peace and reveal strength and beauty within the industrial framework destined to decay with fearless burning hearts, moving towards the end through all the sadness. A flood of brilliant talents poured into the desert duel arena yesterday. The kids were united and resigned to extremely intense bumping and grinding that would tear a plane. Reputable participants, including familiar and newly introduced Zeerackians, The You Love Me Mighty King, and Nors dealt a huge chunk of damage knocking around one on one with each other in rapid succession with a variety of gear either embracing balanced combinations of abilities or religiously engaging with the old animations in the minority. They continued to rise above with each challenge. We have reached all upkeep goals in the sitadell except metal bars and cloth. We need more of them.

Nors, Zeerackians, and friends swept the decks of the fishing guild and surrounded Legs. He became a certified leading provider of a unique brand of packaged sea food and had no more financial problems on Friday. He tore through the walls of the warriors guild and cut down the outlaw within, saving lives and obtaining a virtual level of 120 before wrapping himself in the weighted cape on Saturday. Interest in cabbage punch saga had grown quickly, with it spotlighted. Under the control of P V P Champion Biggy, merged with other Zeerackians including the Queen, You Love Me, and Nors a miracle occured. We were taken into it on World 83 for a few games instead of the instant shard worlds, and we had no problems with bullying cheaters for the most part. No one denied the point of Gorilla's existence, to feast on human cheese. King Davey and I stole away to a conquest session on Sunday. Over and over he closed in inexorably, comically attacked and claimed my men. I tried desperately to change the direction of the game with generally sensible moves, and I was successful until the end, when my only option was to evade and pray for the command points to execute his final knight with my last foot soldier. He took it away. I passed through the sacred space dispelling a magical barrier containing Extortify on Monday. Entoy and I rung the church bell, calling people to civil defense of mankind and a break down of the coven. Monstrous beings tried but failed to daunt his pilgrim''s spirit on the desolate penninsula. Mister 104 reflected on the terrestrial impact that occured at the begining of the sixth age. Smoke poured out of the mining pit as though it were from a huge furnace and the scorpions came upon Entoy. We crushed them into ooze. Around the corner from the donut shop in Fal-adore, where good ideas come from with the beverage of choice, a white knight kick started his day with a delishiously smooth blend mixed with a four ring organic compound. Mighty Men of You Love Me and Famous Warriors of Nors were wired and driven to get rid of the last vestiges of a feudal social structure. They fought bigger and stronger opponents in the street, ending with giants of the times looking up in confusion as they crashed to the ground on Tuesday. Miss Kreativity was honored for her great influence on the sport of fishing and draped in a cape emphasizing her mastery. We were transported to the gamer's grotto yesterday to compete in a war of heroes on the teams of captain Haku and Captain Entoy. Team Entoy snuck around to the opponents portal for an ambush, unsuspecting of a watchful eye. As the vibrations sped up in the rugged extreme, we shrugged off water, sand, and dust and provided nearly enough force to nearly catch up with them. Both teams continuously used basic triangle tactics and piling like liquid to achieve the ultimate goal. Team Haku emerged victorious. We have reached two upkeep goals in the sitadell we need metal bars, precious bars, and cloth.

The clan sitadell theatre showcased the debut of in house band Some Distant Memory's first four songs' lyrics for the revelation album on Friday. You Love Me Mighty King Davey described them as detailed and mysterious. Citizens of Al Kharid had hope as the primary defense was airdropped in the desert, and watched as the small team invaded the hive and served the drama queen with dismay at the step by step disruption of her master plans with a mythical presence. We withstood and killed hundreds of her savage angry drones, removing the imminent threat of killer dung beetles on Saturday. We visited the cities of Burthrope, Candyfist, and Darkmeyer on Sunday to certify them safe for the public. Upon arrival, we were stunned to see overblowing crime rates in the regions. An internal affairs agent was indicted for stealing 500 k. A rare instance of zombie, with personality and intelligence almost overcame authorities by speeding on water. They sensed much fear and guilt in a nervous woman. A male juvenate dropped a bomb with a stench of human feces, causing the guards to pass out. No blind eye was turned to indulgent priests. Fanatical zealots were sentenced to perpetual imprisonment while assassins eliminated their targets. A jailed farmer suspected of conspiracy, dug his way out for months, changed his identity, and reaped the rewards. A hideous sorceress and her blood drinking cohorts were captured and conscripted. P V M Complex organized plans for an attack on a public beach with weapons of mass destruction on Monday. My seriously smoking wife and I were attentive of our surroundings, while we possessed eternal life in the unworldly isolation of the tower, hoping to reverse our accelerating decreptitude. We were plagued by mysterious events after managing to escape the sepulchre of death with a young child. We set out on a hike across the country and drifted to the railroad tracks by McGrubor's Woods, where we encountered Mister Blak, whose minecart had crashed. The Queen and King of Hearts spread the universal message, choosing health for the fallen Kinshra. Incredible numbers of powerful agents met behind closed doors in the lower levels of the Blue Moon Inn. P V M Complex gave us insight into coveted information. With Zeerackian and You Love Me allies, we played a major role, bestowed by the dark horseman with the task of sending the restless souls to an afterlife without an after afterlife. We searched the water on board rowboats and uplifted them to the bridge above. Ahead of them, they faced shiny painted venomous Gorrillas and Kurasks, trying to put an end to their running. We fought for their freedom to carry on and live happily forever, then went forth to punish the mad Goddess on Tuesday. Members of New Order, Zeerack Kingdom, and Elliot traveled to the Kinshra camp, not 10 steps away from the clan camp, to see me apply myself in intensive care for black knights wounded in the invasion of Fal-adore and gain experience for masters. I was rewarded with a cape for my clinical practices and the ability of self necromancy from the instructor yesterday. We gathered with the Mighty King and deployed into the modern primitive deadlands, to discover and destroy the dominant macroers in Forinthry and other dragon territories. Peekayers came at us with their main force while we were slowed down by the attacking revenants. On our way back, Sin and In you were caught in a random battle amongst themselves and both died. We tried using the Zaros obelisk to teleport us around in our search. More Peekayers closed in on us and pushed us to our last throw. We have reached all upkeep goals in the sitadell.

A fal-adore guard came to block Mister Blak's way. Despite not hating him previously, he understood that he could not allow him to go free, and burhed the miserable wretch. He reached the zenith of his journey into the kaleidoscopic world of magic on Thursday. Mister one oh four ceremoniously begain to fill his roles as herblorist and chef, and personify promotion of self improvement and good deeds by reciting the oath to a small audience on Friday. A pink brigade emerged in Lumbridge and engulfed the most occupied parts of Mithsalin and Asgarnia on a trade world. Coordinated by Zeerack Kingdom, and their allies, we showed support and made an effort to create greater awareness of cancer in a march. Then, skirts dropped in Burthrope and we had a good wild time on Saturday. Entoy set his sights on a venti bout and hit the floor with me in the gym. I was washed thouroughly and shredded. He fulfilled his destiny. We awoke to find ourselves captive in the dilapidated forgotten floors with You Love Me Royals Beloved Queen Lady Bev and Mighty King Davey, divided against the only known survivors in mental and physical combat. Pursued by some things we understodd and others we did not recognize, we broke the unbreakable machine within an hour. Sunday was spent getting the edge to reach our full potential at the Burthrope Games Room. Initially an uninterrupted string of contests of Runesquares and Runelink with Zeerackians and Nors did not signify improvements for me. They had no direct effect on the outcome of draughts with Entoy, however. I was determined to show skill. We were bothi in the upside, finding the best way out of capture, until we were consumed by an unstoppable tie for forty moves. Davey came down from the misty mountains on Monday, yearning for merrymaking with his mob of goblins and reflected on his powerful position. We were allowed to stay in the cursed crumbling sandstone suffragette city. Mortus waited outside the entrance to a mysterious cave filled with supernatural horrors and atmospheric soundtrack in his pirate costume to give people lining up a tour. Entoy harvested crops on the soon to be sold off monastic grange to provide healthy organic foods to at risk community members. I was fortunate enough to work with You Love Me Mighty King Davey on Tuesday. As the key players on the scene with rare conviction and power, we tolled up and settled things once and for all, explosively expelling the familes of the K G B and Cow Fight Queen in a massive blood bath cranked up really high. There was no world for them to move around in. We confronted the morality of our work while claiming properties beyond our wildest dreams. We made our way through the flames of no man's land and met again with awesome and beloved allies and enjoyed their company in the dark and fiery landscape for the ultimate party last night. Together, we improved unbeatable quality in innovative fashion, using the competition to our advantage, which offered different outcomes each time.

Without unnecessary clothing, You Love Me Mighty King Davey, Zeerackian Blitz, and I crossed the border into our ultimate destination on Friday. We covered the likes of the place and focused on stocking up fashionable finds. I did not defend myself when that buster struck me. Blitz became obedient unto death, repaying Davey with his soul. My attempt at vengeance cost me an arm and a leg, and settled his position as lord of the wilderness. Morty and I felt that we should race through the vacated site of the ancient tombs in a dangerous and brutal black market sweep to make some bank whiled disturbing the peace of the beaten and the damned with ambient clamor. Some circumstances were out of my control, determining him the winner on Saturday. We possessed and controlled the instant shard world on Sunday and accomplished our goals of defeating the threat of a ragtag bunch of teenagers with attitude. As a result of relentless force upon them, they decided to accept Gorillas. Harold Death Esquire had Davey in his office for a short tutorial to assume the position temporarily and thwart evil schemes on Monday. A wormhole opened up, enabling travel to a similar device elsewhere. Entoy and I emerged in a habitable zone and took command of the project. As a young photo journalist, Entoy had a good working relationship with the draconic professor of unnatural history in the unique pocket office. Weary from the journey tossing and turning on the raging sea, I found some hope when Gen greeted me in the desolate world covered in ice and snow. Our steps got springier with the hunger for precious gold in the lost mines of Al Kharid. There was only so much to go around. Blitz and I wandered into the dark and perilous lair of an oversized sentient arachnid with an unsatiable desire to devour anything that gave off light. Only his magic allowed us to escape. Foxy traveled the distance as an important apprentice producing masterpieces for the chief blacksmith of Burthrope. You Love Me Royals and well known Zeerackians warmed up and sailed ship with two nors chiefs on Tuesday. The suffering void knight employed our military service in the ongoing crisis in return for creating a barrier to provide protection for our world. The series of assaults granted signifigant positive results. I caught up with the Zeerackian champions and You Love Me King in the Cold and ancient cavern and we set off on an excessively violent fast moving adventure. I stood no chance against the evoked Davey, but I became the very butcher of his silk button. I came across Blitz and forced him to flee until he stumbled to the brink of extinction. I deviated and my kneecaps were shatterd by one shot from his bow. The King was bombarded with a series of ruthless distraction strikes and hammerfists until he died. We were on a constant comedic thrill ride until he chopped me up with his scythe. Driven out of hiding, Biggy was capable of recovering from multiple wounds with minimal medical treatment and became hostile prey. I was swiftly killed and dragged away.

Having returned from his excellent adventures rescuing historical figures and inspiring humanity to live as a utopian society, Mortus resumed practice with his sinister axe in blazing speed and awakened a sinister fiend to duel with on Saturday. To heal some wounds, I concealed my treasure two feet below a protective pentagram. Mortus snuck into the Arthurian controlled castle grounds and pulled it out. I dug further into the small village of discount candy fist and opened his money pit. I was out of practice at Sunday's conquest event, playing against You Love Me Mighty King Davey and New Order's resident pro Rage. Davey was just warming up when he effectively broke through my front with the heavily armored fire power of his champion in the early stages of our game. He led by two to one at the end. I was misguidingly more confident of my potential in the next game with Rage, who secured my destruction with stealthy soldiers and rapid movement. Kasper vanquished folkloric beasts and mythical monsters lurking within the walls of the stone castle on the hill top in pursuit of Miss Cherry on Monday. Kasper and I toured the infamous abandoned prison across the river. I enchanted a broom to perform some chores for the sorcerer while I had Kas over for tea. Mortus spent the night without fear, asleep in the quiet jungle near the peaceful village. He and I followed Kas discreetly on the docks where Davey asked to meet him alone. Kasper took the time to mine the eroding ice caves in isolation and caught a break. Frend and I kept our blades sharp for the best cutting action against the vines that continued to grow on the wall of the small peaceful town. Expert practitioners of New Order, You Love Me, and Ye Olde Pub cooperated and occupied positions at the bottom levels beneath the surface of the Barbarian Outpost, building on each others work to go all the way like we knew we could in waste collection to protect the environment of the barbarian people. We sprang a leak in wave five and found ourselves back where we started from with faces full of dirt on Tuesday. We gained dominion and rigourously forged destruction on concrete playgrounds and their natural surroundings with awesome allies yesterday. The disadvantages of being mistakenly ill-equipted were visibly weighed against me. I was blown up on my first venturing out and recognized a pattern of binding and punishment. Through a miracle, I pulled off a capture with my limited ability. The signifigant power of golden dharoks took hold almost immediately, when I was in the service of the blue team. I endured corrupting damage and eluded furious attempts on my life while seizing the opposing sides flag and recovering our own. We have reached all upkeep goals in the sitadell.

A small chilled assemblage of Nors, You Love Me, Noz Vincere, and In you with a lust for blood running in their souls, tossed up the sands and cooperated in containing the warlike hound to proceed to beat viciously and seize its spoils on Saturday.

Our allies and Miss Chappie reset the tone with readings of eternally listenable classics and A 7 X. We dumped a load of an anonymous mass of bandosians, which earned the hatred of the most vile ourg and precipitated a war with a small group of creatures without realizing it. We assumed the positions and did not dissapoint with the use of our best moves. The battle climaxed with the death of Graador and my A Z N on Saturday. Zeerackian elf Lainadann went so far for a length of time, and finally attained recognized master experience of all skills on display for clanmembers and allies in Burthrope for the first time, qualifying him to wear a tidy cape.

A long time ago, I buried a vast treasure in ideal conditions far from urban life. Careful not to disturb the breeding grounds of interesting reptiles, Mortus unearthed the gold.

Light armoured raiders entered the instant shard world to see if there was anything they could do and tasted the tuna. We returned the favor by clearing the sole survivors on Saturday. The chic and elegant sitadell theatre was packed with New Order, You Love Me, and the Society of The Owl on Sunday. Attendees hung out or stepped up to offer originals, covers, and comedy. The lyrics for the first song to be on Some Distant Memory's second album were unveiled. The period was shorter than average, allowing Sora and Mighty King Davey to pass through Seers village and harvest on Monday. The local pro shop was all too happy to pass on their huge supply for Davey's week long fishing trip with the princess.

The shop keeper offered his finest sword and personal quarters. Sora raised the flag to herald a new era of prosperity after much diplomatic effort from the secret council. Kit and Sora were brought out of their distresses to relax and socialize in their desired haven. The queen and king of you love me helped a pyro with a mullet test the beacon system.

In six simple exercises, little wooden spooks died horribly one by one at the hands of my slayer partner Miss Osyx of Noz Vincere and myself on Tuesday.

I was shot dead in the crossfire on Saturday. There was no rescue from the logical prowess of Morty who played as though he had many times before in our conquest match on Sunday. I held my ground and laughed in the face of death hoping to go out in a blaze of glory against the very beastly Izami until he lagged out, leaving our match undecisive. Sora enlisted the help of Vovka to drive out a rare form of monster possessing an unpleasant witch's house. Vovka had a lot in store for him dwelling in a great underground complex.

There was only one way for Izami to leave us temporarily on Thursday. He took on one last job, hosting a Boodo kai Ten kai chi tournament to give several others the oppurtunity to claim the title of champion, large cash prizes, and the King of Runefists crown. After the dramatic speech, I blasted past three out of four of my duels with a dirty and rusted spear, putting me in second place. In the end it was the Zeerackian General Biggy who won the grand prize and crown. A horde of resourceful campers of the expendable gender went into the woods and some people disappeared on Friday.

Well traveled midnight strollers and velvet charmers found their way into the central hubb of the town where Vovka was staying. Blitz found time to do everything he could to help the neighborhood recover. Due to renewed interest in inter-dimensional travel, Morty and I explored the eternal unchanging version of Gill-lenore with Zeerackian Fame Miss Mell on Tuesday. Looking slim, we fulfilled our own goals and objectives while navigating, striking fear into the hearts of ruthless outlaws and menacing characters foolish enough to fight us in misguided attempts to prove themselves, and reviving ancient sciences. We did what was right whereever and whenever it needed to be done. Demand for the coveted purple cloth superseded supply. A diverse group of people from New Order, Zeerack Kingdom, and You Love Me gathered yesterday, eager for a grand notorious slam within the boundaries of Castle Wars. I was quickly relinquished on the dangerous conventional path and decided to take them by surprise gaining passage underground. More favorable results were produced gradually after every capture.

Commanding coolness and their subordinates found worthy opponents clever enough to keep up in Zeerackian Castle Wars, hosted by General Biggs. For signifigant portions of the two games, the fights seemed futile with neither side able to possess the flags. Luck was with the leopard speed runners of the blue team once per game.

He and Morty accompanied me to a garden party, where we attempted to educate the attendees about the truth.

Four clans went on a trip to see the factory and caught a glimpse of secret tunnels and mutant carnivores hatching a plan of colonial mass murder against the barbarians.
