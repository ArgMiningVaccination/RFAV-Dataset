Table of Contents What is Aromatherapy? Aromatherapy is a practice that involves using natural plant extracts, known as essential oils, to promote physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being. These plant extracts are obtained through a process of distillation from various parts of plants, such as leaves, flowers, stems, and roots, and are highly concentrated. Essential oils are highly aromatic and contain the essence and natural fragrance of the plant from which they were extracted. They are used for a wide range of purposes, including perfumery, natural cleaning, and for their healing properties. How Aromatherapy Works Essential oils work by interacting with our sense of smell, which is responsible for the detection of odors. When we inhale an essential oil, the olfactory system in our brain sends signals to the limbic system, which is responsible for our emotional responses. Essential oils have unique chemical compositions, which affect the way our brain interprets the scent. This is why different essential oils can have different effects on our mood, emotions, and overall well-being.
