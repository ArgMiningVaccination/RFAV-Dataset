She is knowledgeable and truly cares for her patients! She listens intently and works thru all your concerns. Dr Ken chose the best in Dr Abby to carry on the legacy of Back In Motion! Amanda B. Couldn't say enough good things about Dr. Parrish at Back in Motion! A couple of years ago I herniated a disc in my back pretty good. I saw a pt first, wasn't completely satisfied, and then found my way to Dr. Parrish. She immediately started diagnosing the issue with great attention to detail and care. Over a period of time the pain was gone, and she had fixed my back. We then went into maintenance mode, and she's taken care of it ever since. Her bedside manner is gentle, and she genuinely cares about you and your health. I highly recommend Dr. Parrish, and certainly glad she is back in our area. G. H. Dr. Abbie is hands down the best chiropractor I've have been to. She is very knowledgeable and listens to complaints about the body. I have recommended her to everyone. Lauren C. Dr. Parrish has been an amazing Doctor to be in the care of. With an extensive base of knowledge and decision making, she helped me start to identify health problems that years of pediatricians and other doctors have glanced over or missed through the years Zach H. This is a great place. They got me in on a Friday when no one else could. I've been see them for over a month now and all my pain has went away. I can't thank them enough. I would recommend them to anyone. Michael T. Dr.Abbie is very friendly and very observant when it comes to your care... I'm very happy to have her as my chiropractor now. Veronica M. Dr.Parrish is kind, smart, and she knows where she's going with your care. Angie H. Dr. Parrish is a wonderful doctor. Her transition from Dr. Ken was seamless. She's been intentional about continuing my treatment, while taking time to assess my needs personally. Her chiropractic skills have kept me feeling well. PLUS!!! She's as sweet as she can be! Pretty cool to have a doctor who cares for the whole person. Christina S. I saw Dr Parrish this past Monday for the first time. She was awesome and does wonders with her chiropractic skills. Ben C. Dr. Parrish is just incredible!! Today was my first visit with her, but it will not be my last. She is professional; yet, she makes you feel right at home. Going back on Monday and I can't wait. I am certain she will get to the bottom of the pain that I am experiencing. Thanks, Dr. Parrish!!! Mary Ann D.
