In their undergraduate and graduate coursewor k, students are a part of a community of learners, engaged in thoughtful reading, writing, critical thinking, and pedagogy. The curriculum includes English courses providing a solid content background and numerous pedagogy courses focused on the teaching of English in the secondary classroom. As a multi -award program, students complete graduate courses that focus on content and pedagogy, adding rigor to the program. Student teaching serves as a capstone at the graduate level and involves an intensive exp erience in the field, applying the theoretical foundations to the classroom. Students will complete the clinically rich, combined B.A./M.A. fully prepared to teach in the secondary schools. This five -year multi -award degree saves students time and money. This program requires five years instead of the six in a traditional B.A. and M.A. program, thus saving a year of graduate tuition and other related expenses. MAJOR REQUIREMENTS The first three years of the five -year B.A./M.A. program parallel the Engl ish Adolescence Education B.A., giving students interested in the multi -award program the opportunity to declare at any time in the first three years.

Upon successful completion of screening and requisite coursework, 90 earned credit hours, and a minimum GPA of 3.0, students will become \"candidates\" in the fourth year and enroll in undergraduate and graduate English/English Adolescence Education courses. Students will be considered undergraduates through the fourth year for tuition, academic requirements, and financial aid purposes. In the fifth year, students are full -time graduate students, completing the remaining English/English Adolescence Education graduate courses and their capstone student teaching experiences. They will pay graduate tuition and will be eligible for graduate financial aid. Earning both B.A. and M.A. degrees in five year s with graduate coursework in the fourth year at the undergraduate tuition rate saves students time and money. As Undergraduates : Students in the program are required to earn at least a C+ in each required English and English Education undergraduate course . In addition to the English courses listed below, Adolescence Education majors must also take the following courses, achieving an average of 2.50: EDU 224, EDU 250, EDU 251, EDU 303, EDU 304, and EDU 349. Candidates must complete at least 66 undergraduate credit hours outside the major in order to graduate. Credits earned for ENGL 100 (Craft of Writing) do not count toward the major, but do count as hours outside the major. Credits earned as ENED count toward the 66 credit hours outside the major. Credi ts transferred as ENGL 099 do not count toward the major, but do count as ENGL hours outside the major area. Screening: Becoming an English Adolescence Education candidate and beginning graduate coursework in the fourth year is contingent upon meeting prog ram requirements and a successful screening interview given by a panel of English Adolescence Education faculty. Screening interviews allow students to demonstrate their mastery of key pedagogical, content, and disposition issues related to English Adolesc ence Education.

In education, students should complete EDU 105/106 with a B - or better. If desired, they may also enroll in EDU 224. In language, students who are not ready to enroll directly in 300 -level language courses should complete FREN/SPAN 215 and/or 216 w ith a grade of B or better. By April 1 of the first year, students will formally apply to the program through a departmental application. Students must have an overall GPA of 3.0 or better at the time of application and must not have had any professional d ispositions issues in the first year. Candidates wishing to continue in the program must attend a departmental orientation and complete a departmental application, both in the Fall semester of the year before their participation in Secondary School (Adoles cence) Methods (the year before they wish to student teach). To be eligible for the departmental screening process, candidates must meet the minimum criteria of at least a 3.0 GPA in their Education courses and a minimum 3.0 GPA in their major language courses at the 300 level and above. In addition, at the time of screening, usually in February of the year before student teaching, candidates must have completed at least 21 credit hours in the language with an overall GPA of 3.0 or better in the major. Cour ses in progress do not count. As a result of the screening process, the department will recommend those candidates who demonstrate superior competency in the language, responsibility, dependability, maturity, and a clear grasp of the realities of the teach ing profession. The Secondary School (Adolescence) Methods course will be taken in the Fall semester immediately preceding student teaching. Admission is limited to those candidates who have been accepted into the program after the screening process and who plan to follow the course with a semester of student teaching. In order to continue in the program, candidates must earn a minimum grade of \"B\" in Secondary School (Adolescence) Methods and must continue to have an overall GPA of 3.0 in all language cour ses. All Modern Languages Adolescence Education majors are required to take the Official ACTFL Oral Proficiency Interview (OPI) and achieve a rating of Advanced Low or higher in order to student teach. By May of their junior year, candidates should have t aken the OPI and achieved Advanced Low or higher. Students who score below that rating must enroll in FREN/SPAN 415 during the fall of their senior year and will have the opportunity to retake the OPI. Students who do not achieve the minimum rating after this course will not be able to student teach but will be able to graduate with a Bachelor of Arts in French/Spanish and should meet with their ALL PRO GRAMS | 29 advisor before the fall semester is over to discuss their courses for the following spring. Candidates are res ponsible for the cost of this proficiency exam. The Modern Languages Program Coordinator will work with the Office of Field Experiences to determine a student teaching assignment for each candidate. During the first weeks of student teaching, candidates wi ll enter into an individually designed agreement with the university supervisor and cooperating teacher concerning their work in the assignment. As of December 31, 2013, candidates in all education programs are required to complete training under the Digni ty for All Students Act (DASA). Beginning in the Fall 2013 semester, the training required under the Dignity for All Student Act (DASA) will be included in EDU 303 at Fredonia.

Graduates of the program are well prepared to enter graduate school in many areas of biological science, or professional programs (such as medical, dental, veterinary, physician's assistant, etc.), become research technicians, secondary school teachers, or enter direct employment. To meet these varied interests, the department offers a wide variety of courses ranging from the molecular or physiological aspects of biology to ecology, field and environmental biology. Stu dents interested in pre -medicine, pre-veterinary and pre -dental programs are strongly urged to register with the Health Professions Advising Committee for individual advising about specific types of professional schools. The department is also involved wit h several early acceptance and combined degree programs leading to professional degrees in medicine, dentistry, optometry, and pharmacy. Further details of these programs are listed under Pre-Medicine and Allied Areas (p. 150). The Department of Biology offers Bachelor of Science degrees in Biology (p. 35), Molecular Genetics (p. 118), Medical Technology (p. 115), and Biology Adolescence Education (p. 22), combined BS/MS 5 year program, as well as Master of Science (p. 38) degree programs to students who have already obtained a B.S. in Biology. The department also participates in the Biochemistry (p. 33), Cooperative Engineering, and the Environmental Sciences programs. Biology department faculty have been awarded the Chancellor's Award for Excellence in Teaching, the President's Award for Excellence in Teaching, the Hagan Young Scholar Award and/or the Robert W. Kasling Award in recognition of their outstanding achievement s in teaching and research. The Department of Biology is particularly proud of its undergraduate research opportunities. Junior and senior undergraduate students have the opportunity to work closely with faculty members on original research projects (for example, see BIOL 440). Students annually present their research results at the university -wide Student Research and Creativity Exposition and at regional and national meetings. Students have been co -authors of papers published in scientific journals. A wi de range of research projects is available in molecular or cellular biology, biochemistry, physiology, behavior, aquatic biology and ecology. Summer Research Fellowships are sponsored in biology each summer. Each sophomore or junior awarded a prestigious fellowship will work on a specific project designed in collaboration with a faculty sponsor. The fellowships are supported by the the Holmberg Foundation, Falcone Endowment, Dr. Robert Wettingfeld Endowment, Constantine Barker Memorial Endowment, Biology En dowment, and the Yunghans -Dieter award. Each award provides the student with a generous stipend and a supplies budget. For more information, interested students should contact a faculty sponsor in the department. Each student performs a capstone experience in their senior year. The experience can take the form of research, an ALL PROGRAMS | 35 internship, a study abroad experience, or course, and provides significant learning experiences in problem solving and written and oral communication. These capstones experiences are extremely important in helping the student prepare for entry into professional programs, graduate school, or employment. Many students also enjoy the activities of the student -run Biology Club that invites all biology students to join them. The club organi zes many activities including faculty seminars on graduate school applications, careers in the Biological Sciences, and participating in undergraduate research, as well as social activities. Biology Honors Program This program provides talented Biology dep artment majors the opportunity to perform research at the graduate level. Honors students will perform a minimum of two semesters of research, produce a formal thesis and offer a lecture to the campus and a private thesis defense to the faculty.

Subtotal: 58 Total Credit Hours: 58 Chemistry Biochemistry Office: 221 Science Cente r Fountain, Chairperson Email: chemistry.department@fredonia.edu Website: http://home.fredonia.edu/chemistry The goals of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry are to prepare its majors for advanced study in chemistry, chem ical engineering, related disciplines or professional programs; or careers in industrial, environmental, and governmental laboratories; or for careers in teaching. The department strongly believes in the value of rigorous course work combined with practica l experience. Thus, students spend much of their time in the department participating in undergraduate research; this has led to an informal atmosphere with considerable student -faculty interaction. Often the results of such research are presented at confe rences or published in chemistry journals. The Chemistry Club is very active and includes in its activities an outreach program to local schools. Departmental honors and scholarships include the Kaminski, Moos, Keller, Thumm, Marletta, Costanza, Maytum, Su pple, Borriello, and Dingledy awards. The department offers two tracks, each leading to a B.S. in Chemistry degree. Track I, the Standard Major, is often chosen by students having second majors or minors in related disciplines. Track II satisfies the curri culum requirements of the American Chemical Society (A.C.S.) and is recommended for students interested in graduate or professional schools. Each track requires the completion of a Core Program plus additional course work. The Department of Chemistry and B iochemistry also administers a major in Biochemistry. Grading Standards: A minimum C - grade is necessary for all required chemistry courses counted toward the major or minor; a collective minimum 2.00 grade point average is necessary for all required mathe matics, and physics courses. Prerequisites/Co -requisites for Laboratory Courses: Laboratory and lecture courses are separately enrolled and graded. As a result, there are some general requirements for laboratory courses: (1) CHEM 126 or CHEM 130 is a prere quisite for any laboratory course at a higher level; (2) for all laboratory courses the corresponding lecture course is a pre- or co -requisite; (3) if a student drops or withdraws from a lecture course, he/she may be required to withdraw from the correspon ding laboratory course. Cooperative Engineering: The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry participates in the Cooperative Engineering program. For more information on the Cooperative Engineering program, please consult the Cooperative Engineering secti on of the catalog. Teacher Certification: Students wishing to teach chemistry in the secondary schools can obtain provisional certification by completing either of the tracks described below and the 44| STATE UNIVERSITY O F NEW YORK AT FREDON IA 2020 -2021 UNIVERS ITY CATALOG required courses in Professional Education.

Department of Communication Minimum Standards Policy Students in any of the communication majors must earn at least a C grade in all courses in the major. This includes all courses taken as part of the major including those in the department core (101, 105, 199). A student who receives a grade below C in a course may repeat that course only once. If a student does not achieve a C or better the second time, he/she will be required to change to a major outside of the Department of Communication. If a course in the major is a prerequisite for another course in the major, the student will not be allowed to enroll in the second course if the grade in the prerequisite was less than a C. In addition, students must have, in order to graduate, a least a 2.5 average in the departmental core and in the rest of the courses in thei r chosen major. This does not include courses taken in the Department of Communication that do not apply to the student's major.

Students who have dual majors with both majors inside the Communication department are still required to have a minor outside the department or meet the criteria for the study abroad option. A second major outside the Communication department will also satisfy this requirement. On the occasion that the requirements for an outside major are the same as the CORE courses for a major within the Department of Communication (e.g. Arts Administration), students must complete all requirements for both majors. Students may \"double -dip\" one course that is required for both majors. If there is more than one duplicate course required, students must take one approved elective from the Communication major per each additional course required by the outside major. One or more of the electives must be 300/400 level. Minor: The department requires all students to declare and complete a second major or minor outside the department, or a 15 credit hour semester study abroad. The minor must be officially recognized by the offering department (including Interdisciplinary Studies minors) and be chosen in consultation with a Department of Communication advisor. A second major outside the communi cation department will also satisfy the minor requirement. Students electing the study abroad option are required to complete a complementary 3 credit hour course at Fredonia and should consult the department's policies on appropriate overseas course work. International students, by virtue of studying at Fredonia, have already completed the study abroad/minor requirement. Cross -using Courses for Minors: Certain minors include some communication courses that may fulfill course requirements for that minor. St udents may use (double -dip) only one COMM course (maximum 4 credit hours) required for the Communication major to fulfill course requirements for the minor. Substitutions in requirements for majors may be made only by approval of faculty members designated for the specific majors. Special topics classes used to fulfill the requirements for majors must be approved by faculty members designated for the specific majors.

The study of economics encompasses a wide range of human behavior and experiences. Therefore, it has come to be widely recognized as a solid preparation for many professional careers in business, finance, non -profit organizations, and government. Courses in economics that emphasize the relevance of economic principles to areas in business, finance, quantitative and computer applications, public 68| STATE UNIVERSITY O F NEW YORK AT FREDON IA 2020 -2021 UNIVERS ITY CATALOG administration or industrial relations, prov ide the student with an excellent background for a variety of jobs and professions. The study of economics also provides an excellent preparation for graduate study in such professional areas as law, industrial relations, business and public administration . Economics majors have the opportunity to participate in Omicron Delta Epsilon, the International Honor Society in Economics. Annually, the Maytum scholarships and Hart - Gorman Economic Awards go to the outstanding majors and double majors in Economics. Economics as Preparation for Master of Business Administration Degree (M.B.A.) Most graduate schools of business prefer their students to have a broad, liberal arts background. Since economics is more closely related to business administration than many other liberal arts areas, it is an ideal preparation for study toward the Master of Business Administration degree. According to a study conducted by the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), graduate business school professors stress ec onomics as the most important undergraduate preparation. Economics Major as Pre -Law Study There are no precisely prescribed pre -law programs or undergraduate courses. However, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education, many law schools believe that ec onomics is one of the best preparations for the study of law. A recent study found that among the 14 majors that had more than 2,000 students taking the Law School Admission Test (LSAT), Economics majors received the highest average test scores in recent y ears. MAJOR, MINOR IN ECON OMICS We offer a major in Economics (B.A. degree) with designed fields in Business and Financial Economics; Data Analysis and Computer Applications; and Public Policy and Economics. Alternatively, with consultation and approval of the faculty advisor, the student may develop his/her own field of specialization. Thirty -six (36) credit hours of course work are required for a major in Economics. A minor, which requires 24 credit hours in economics, is also available. As an option to students majoring in Economics, we offer a letter certifying the completion of International Economic Studies to those who complete 15 credit hours of designated course work.

The national recognition of our programs demonstrates the effectiveness of Fredonia's innovative curriculum used in preparing new generations of teachers for today's diverse learners. Program Philosophy and Conceptual Framework for All Certification Programs The College of Education believes that all children can learn and that they learn best when taught by reflective and responsive educators who carefully assess their instructional competence via reflections upon pupil performa nce. Responsive educators make informed decisions based on these reflections and adjust instruction to enhance pupil progress. All candidates in the College of Education - Professional Education Unit complete a series of four field -based experiences. Each field-based experience is taught in conjunction with a required education course to clearly connect educational theory and practice. Each of the field experiences is highly structured, well supervised, and intended to provide multiple opportunities for can didates to Plan, Instruct, Reflect, and Respond with school children in classroom settings. Candidates also enroll in course work related to child and adolescent development, applications of psychology in the classroom, and pedagogical strategies as well a s liberal arts and discipline -specific content courses. All of the courses work together to strengthen the candidates' Four Pillars of Understanding \u2014 Knowledge, Pedagogy, Diversity, and Professionalism \u2014 which in turn support the process of ALL PROGRAMS | 71 effective plan ning, instructing, reflecting, and responding. Course work and instruction are rooted in a strong foundation of research -based practices and strategies, contextual factors that influence instruction, and standards for teaching and learning. Candidate Organ izations for All Certification Programs Within the College of Education, a dynamic and active Teacher Education Club offers activities that provide an array of opportunities for academic, personal, and professional growth, as well as community service. The College of Education also houses the Zeta Upsilon Chapter of the International Honor Society in Education, Kappa Delta Pi.

Upon approval of the applicant's acceptance into one of the graduate programs, the applicant should apply for a College of Education Graduate Assistantship via Interview Exchange. The dean and the two department chairs (Curriculum and Instruction, and Language, Learning and Leadership) will review the applications and conduct interviews with all finalists to determine the final list of graduate assistants for the fall semester. Criteria for selectio n as a graduate assistant within the College of Education include: availability for work assignment during regular office hours, Monday through Friday; intellectual potential to support appropriate research and program evaluation activities of the unit; ap propriate written and oral communication skills; and appropriate scholarly and professional dispositions. Applications received by March 15 will be given priority. Program Philosophy and Conceptual Framework for All Certification Programs The College of Ed ucation believes that all children can learn and that they learn best when taught by reflective and responsive educators who carefully assess their instructional competence via reflections upon pupil performance. Responsive educators act upon information gleaned from their professional reflections; they make informed decisions and adjust instruction to enhance pupil progress. Candidates enroll in course work related to child/adolescent development, educational foundations, and pedagogical strategies, as wel l as discipline -specific content courses. All of the courses strengthen the ALL PROGRAMS | 81 candidates' Four Pillars of Understanding (Knowledge, Pedagogy, Diversity, and Professionalism), which in turn support the process of effective planning, instructing, reflecting, a nd responding. Course work and instruction are rooted in a strong foundation of research -based practices and strategies, contextual factors that influence instruction, and standards for teaching and learning. Graduate programs provide a variety of gateways to advanced certification, further professional development, prepare students for doctoral programs, and act as a stepping -stone to lifelong learning. Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP) Fredonia is fully accredited by CAEP, the n ational accreditation organization. CAEP advances excellent educator preparation through evidence -based accreditation that assures quality and supports continuous improvement to strengthen P -12 student learning. CAEP standards expect the College of Educati on-Professional Education Unit to base its programs on content and teaching standards set by professional associations in each content area. CAEP accreditation adds both credibility and national transportability to Fredonia certification programs. Office o f Student Services The Office of Student Services in E259 Thompson Hall provides information for candidates and potential candidates (in all certification programs) in the areas of advisement, New York State testing requirements, fingerprinting requirement s, application for teacher certification using the online TEACH website, course selection and registration information, professional development opportunities, and more.

State Authorization Disclosure (p. 577) ENGINEERING (COOPERA TIVE) PROGRAM Office: 112 http://ho me.fredonia.edu/physics The Cooperative Engineering program takes its name from the academic cooperative agreements between Fredonia and its affiliated engineering schools. The intent is to combine liberal arts and sciences at Fredonia with engineering at another school, thereby maximizing the student's potential as a member of society and as an employer or employee. The agreements facilitate student transfer and mutual recognition of general education requirements. Fredonia is currently affiliated in a Cooperative Engineering program with the following institutions: Case Western Reserve University (1) Clarkson University (2) Columbia University (3) Louisiana Tech University (4) New York State College of Ceramics at Alfred (5) Ohio State Universi ty (6) Penn State Erie (7) Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (8) Rochester Institute of Technology (9) State University of New York at Binghamton (10) State University of New York at Buffalo (11) Syracuse University (12) Trine University (13) The following is a list of the diverse program options available at the engineering colleges, under the Fredonia Cooperative Engineering program, identified by the 98| STATE UNIVERSITY O F NEW YORK AT FREDON IA 2020 -2021 UNIVERS ITY CATALOG institution code number given above. As institutions are continually revising and updating t heir offerings, students are advised to consult with the catalogs of affiliated schools for recent additions and changes.

Briefly, a student in the 3 -2 option takes a minimum of 90 credit hours (three years) at Fredonia in a curriculum, mod ified specifically for this program, in biology, business administration, chemistry, computer science, economics, English, geology, history, mathematics, mathematics physics, philosophy, physics, political science, psychology, or sociology. The student the n transfers to an affiliated school and completes at least 60 credit hours (two years) in an engineering discipline. When the student completes this five -year option, he/she obtains a baccalaureate from the engineering institution. Provided the student has satisfied Fredonia's remaining requirements at the engineering school, he/she obtains a second baccalaureate; this one from Fredonia according to the curriculum there followed. It is possible for students who do not wish to major in any one of the specifi ed departments to enter the Interdisciplinary Studies program, which allows the student to design his/her own Cooperative Engineering curriculum. This curriculum will include, but not be limited to, the engineering core and related courses for the engineer ing college of the student's choice. Although the popular 3 -2 option is considered the basic option for Cooperative Engineering, 2 -2, 2-3, 3-3, and 4 -2 options are available. The 2 -2 and 2 -3 options do not lead to Fredonia degrees; the 3 -3 and 4 -2 programs do. In many cases the latter will result in a master's degree in engineering in addition to the bachelor's degree from Fredonia.

Students are encouraged to consul t engineering school catalogs for specific requirements. Strongly recommended are courses in computer programming such as Computer Science I (CSIT 121), Modern Physics (PHYS 234), and 3 to 6 credit hours of economics. This core, coupled with the department al and general university requirements, forms the basic curriculum for the three -year program at Fredonia. An attractive feature of the 3 -2 option is that the final decision regarding the area of engineering usually is not made until the third year, thus p roviding the student with sufficient experience to make a proper choice. However, it is to the student's advantage to choose the second institution and the area of engineering as soon as possible so course selections can be tailored to that choice. To transfer, the student first consults with the Cooperative Engineering director and then applies to one of the affiliated engineering colleges or to any other engineering college of his/her choice. Usually, a favorable letter of recommendation from the director is forwarded for highly motivated students with satisfactory academic records. At the affiliated engineering institution, a Fredonia student application is given special consideration. Admission is not, in general, guaranteed. However, for 3 -2 students wi th GPA's exceeding 2.5, 100 percent have gained admission to an engineering school. Since there are more than 60 baccalaureate programs with numerous concentrations available at the affiliated institutions, and since these curricula are frequently updated, it is mandatory that all students registered in Cooperative Engineering meet the director or authorized designee for advisement each and every semester. For students interested in transferring to the Cooperative Engineering program either from other Fredonia majors or from other colleges, the following applies: The student should have completed sufficient background courses to insure timely completion of the three -year Fredonia component. The student should have a cumulative GPA of approximately 2.5 or higher. Students should be aware that engineering schools will not accept students with less than outstanding academic records. A student organization, the Fredonia Engineering and Physics Society, provides opportunities to travel to conferences and oth er extracurricular activities including design projects. Recent projects include the design and construction of a magnetically levitated model train, an optical holography table, and a small robot. A large number of engineering and engineering -related courses comprising most courses typically taught in the first two years at engineering schools are offered at Fredonia. These include Statics, Dynamics and Mechanics of Solids (PHYS 321, PHYS 329, PHYS 322), Circuit Analysis (PHYS (PHYS 33 0), w/lab 341), and Electronics w/lab (PHYS 325 -PHYS 327). Students should contact the director of the Cooperative Engineering program for additional details for the following awards: Herbert P. Carlyon Scholarship Cooperative Eng ineering Scholarship Award English Office: 278 Fenton Hall (716) 673 collaboratively with faculty, Fredonia English students explore the power of language and image in the 21st century. They discover new perspectives and develop crucial skills: strong writing, thoughtful reading, and critical thinking . Whether they choose to focus on literature, creative writing, professional writing, or English education, students personalize their paths through the flexible major in consultation with department advisors. As a vibrant community of learners, we investi gate how texts respond to and shape experience in and beyond the classroom. About Fredonia English The English Department at Fredonia values the importance of studying literature across cultures; fostering lifelong readers and writers; engaging multiple fo rms of textual literacy; practicing the arts of creative and critical writing; and championing the key role of the humanities in higher education. Our English programs blend contemporary literary studies with critical, professional, and creative writing, a nd give students numerous opportunities for hands -on learning through community partnerships and internships. We produce top -notch graduates who get hired by regional and national organizations or go on to graduate 100| STATE UNIVERSITY O F NEW YORK AT FREDON IA 2020 -2021 UNIVERS ITY CATALOG programs all over the country. Recent gra duates of the department are employed by law and business firms, journals and publishers, news and arts organizations, and schools. English and English Adolescence Education majors at Fredonia actively participate in local small -press and online writing in ternships; community service learning projects; literacy campaigns; creative collaborations and field experiences with area schools; public readings of literature to area children, seniors, and the broader community through open -mic events; collaborations with Visual Arts and School of Music students in pairing original writings with graphic design and musical accompaniment; host visiting writers and literary critics; and read a whole lot of terrific literature. The B.A. in English (p. 101) combines required foundational courses with a wide range of options among skills - and content -based course categories in order to open pathways for every student to gain the most from the major and our faculty. Internships and other applied learning opportunities in English -related fields help our students turn those pathways into careers. The B.A. in English Adolescence Education (p. 25) combines required foundational courses in pedagogy and literature and a plethora of field experiences in order to open pathways for all students to develop the ideas and practices that will make them effective in the classrooms of an increasingly complex and diverse society. The B.A./M.A in En glish Adolescence Education (p. 26) leads to initial 7 -12 certification and eligibility for professional certification (after meeting New York State requirements for classroom teaching experience following completion of the program), allowing students to earn both their B.A. and M.A. in English Adolescence Education in five years, rather than the six required in traditional B.A. and M.A. programs. Through courses at both the undergraduate and graduate level, this program offers a solid content background in English, a wide range of courses focused on teaching secondary English, field experiences in secondary schools, and a graduate -level student teaching experience. Graduates of this clinically - rich combined B .A./M.A. will be fully prepared to teach in the secondary schools. The Minor in English (p. 190) gives students maximum flexibility to explore the department's range of offerings in American Studies, creati ve and persuasive writing, drama, English Education, film, linguistics, literary theory, popular culture, women's and gender studies, and world literature. The Minor in Writing and Rhetoric (p. 210) empowers students from an array of disciplines to write effective, persuasive prose for a variety of audiences, contexts, and purposes. The Minor in Creative Writing (p. 186) offers talented fiction writers, essayis ts, and poets an opportunity to develop their voices and hone their craft through a progression of workshop courses in and across genres taught by our award -winning writers. Students also learn to read like a writer and engage in hands -on experiences.

Geology and Environmental Sciences Office: 112 Jewett Hal l Email: geosciences@fredonia.edu Website: http://home.fredonia.edu/earth The Department of Geology and Environmental Sciences offers three degree programs. The B.S. degree program in Geology (p. 105) is intended primarily for students planning to undertake employment or graduate study in geology or who desire a liberal arts education with an emphasis in geology. Graduates of this program will have met the educational requirements for licensure in the State of New York. Most geologists are employed by private industry - in petroleum, mining, cement, ceramic, sand and gravel, and in environmental and engineering firms. Many work for various federal agencies and the 50 s tate ALL PROGRAMS | 105 geological surveys, or are self -employed, often working as consultants. Colleges and universities offer teaching and/or research positions. The B.A. degree program in Earth Science (p. 66) is intended p rimarily for students who want a liberal arts education with a broad emphasis in the several sub - disciplines that constitute the earth science. It is useful to those who have career goals in production, technical services, information systems/processing, marketing/sales, administration and/or finance, rather than goals of becoming professional scientists. The B.S. degree program in Environmental Sciences (p. 67) is intended primarily for students seeking a ca reer in an environmentally related field such as conservation, climate change, wildlife, and forestry. The interdisciplinary nature of this program prepares students for a wide variety of possible careers including: environmental consulting, resource mana gement, conservation scientist, aquatic and fishery research/management, wildlife management, conservation officer, and environmental and community planning. The B.S. degree program in Adolescence Education (p. 24) is intended for those students who plan to teach earth science in secondary schools. It includes the fundamental courses in geology, meteorology, astronomy, and oceanography, which constitute the \"content\" of earth science, and the necessary profes sional education courses. Students planning to pursue a career in the earth sciences as professional scientists should earn one of the B.S. degrees in Geology and Geochemistry, rather than the B.A. or B.S. degrees in Earth Science, because the former requi re a more rigorous background in physics and mathematics which is needed to pursue graduate studies in the geosciences or employment as professional scientists. Teacher Certification: Students who desire to teach earth science in secondary schools may obta in initial certification by completing the B.S. degree program in Earth Science with its required professional courses in Education EDU 224, EDU 250, EDU 303, EDU 304, EDU 349, 430 Science SCED SCED 276, SCED 303, SCED 305, SCED 419) . Students in all education programs are required to demonstrate competence in a foreign language. This requirement may be satisfied in any one of the following ways: (1) Achieving an 85 percent on a Regents language exam, (2) Achieving a 65 percent or bet ter on a Regents language exam and successfully completing an Elementary I or Elementary II level college language course, (3) successfully completing Elementary I level and Elementary II level college language courses in the same language, or (4) successf ully completing an equivalent Fredonia language proficiency exam. The College Core Curriculum foreign language requirement differs from the certification requirement and must be satisfied for degree conferral. Students are screened by the department chairp erson before entering SCED 419. Students are encouraged to participate in the activities of the Geology Club. The department awards textbook scholarships for academic achievement each semester and annually presents the MacDiarmid Award to the department's outstanding graduating senior, the Paul D. Willette Scholarship to the outstanding junior, the Walther M. Barnard Geosciences Scholarship to the outstanding sophomore, and the Mark D. and April Hoefner Orgren Scholarship to the outstanding freshman. The Su san Mara Scholarship is awarded by the faculty to students deserving of special recognition, and the Florence M. Eikenburg scholarship is awarded to outstanding sophomore or junior majors, with first preference going to female students. In addition, the department awards the Spatial Studies Award to outstanding students pursuing studies in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and related fields, the Gary and Eileen Lash Award to promote student growth in the area of field studies, and the Temporal Studies A ward for students doing outstanding work in time -based studies of geological processes relevant to issues facing society. Laboratory credit: 1 credit hour of laboratory work includes three clock hours in the laboratory per week. Four (4)-credit hour course s in geosciences include 1 credit hour of laboratory work.

DEGREE Department of Physics Office: 112 Jewett Hall Website: http://home.fredonia.edu/physics/indman There is a well -recognized need for scientifically and technologically educated managers in the industrial and Research and Development (R & D) communiti es. The Industrial Management program at Fredonia is designed to serve this need by providing the necessary foundation in applied physics, business, economics, and mathematics. It is similar to many engineering and management programs. The curriculum is st ructured to prepare students for careers either in industry, governmental facilities or other organizations that address the present and future technological needs of our society. Graduates can also pursue advanced studies at graduate institutions. The Ind ustrial Management program is an integrated multidisciplinary curriculum combining courses from applied physics (24 -25 credit hours), business/economics (24 credit hours), mathematics/computer science (17 credit hours), social sciences/humanities and a suf ficient number of supporting elective courses to enhance career objectives. Additionally, the foundation of oral and written communication is developed early in the program and consistently used throughout. A college -approved internship experience is requi red following the completion of either the sophomore or junior year. This program is housed in the Department of Physics, but is a distinct program apart from the B.S. in Physics. Therefore, students may double major in Physics and Industrial Management, i f they choose to do so. Students are encouraged to see their academic advisor for details.

Students in the Interdisciplinary Studies programs are committed to exploring innovative connections and emerging relationships drawn from the traditional disciplines and those developing areas of overlap and interface. These students are typically explorers and cr eative problem solvers, and many Interdisciplinary Studies students construct their own topics of study (for either major or minor) using analytical approaches and tools from several fields. The degree program constitutes a student's major; the interdiscip linary minors may be taken by students majoring in any program offered by the university. Students who opt for a truly individualized degree program must develop their own program under the guidance of two faculty members and with the approval of the Assoc iate Provost for Curriculum, Assessment and Academic Support. Students should see the Associate Provost for the necessary forms and guidelines for submitting a formal individualized major proposal. The individualized degree program and the model major prog rams will lead to the degree of Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science (B.A. or B.S.). Students interested in declaring an interdisciplinary minor should consult with the coordinator from the appropriate area. Minor programs and coordinators are listed on the chart. All minors must be formally declared through the Office of the Registrar. Requirements for the Undergraduate Major in Interdisciplinary Studies Degree Program Student must complete a degree plan proposal and submit it for approval to the Asso ciate Provost for Curriculum, Assessment and Academic Support. All students in this major program must complete the university's requirements for the General Education Program and earn the number of credit hours required outside of the major. A maximu m of 45 credit hours in any one discipline may count toward the 120 credit hours total required for the baccalaureate. The proposed major must constitute at least 36 credit hours of which no more than 15 credit hours may come from one discipline. At le ast 24 of those 36 credit hours must be at the 300 - 400 level. A minimum of 45 credit hours of 300 -400 level courses must be included overall in the 120 hours required for graduation. Requirements for the Undergraduate Minor in Interdisciplinary Studies An Interdisciplinary Studies minor is a group of six to nine courses centering on a topic or problem studied from many different points of view. Each minor may be studied in combination with any major. Individualized minors may be created under advisement. Minors must be formally declared through the Office of the Registrar. Undergraduate Interdisciplinary Studies Courses In addition to the major programs and minors, the Interdisciplinary Studies program offers several courses developed for interdisciplinary or special interest purposes. Independent study and internship options are available through Interdisciplinary Studies at the undergraduate level. Internships may receive up to 15 hours of credit. Students proposing an internship are required to prepare a \"Learning Contract\" describing the goals of the internship and how they will be met. Internship forms are available from the Career Development Office and must be completed in consultation with the coordinator of the program.

Taught by faculty and professional staff, each seminar is geared toward the process of self -discovery and is graded on a satisfacto ry/unsatisfactory basis. For more information on the Liberal Arts program, see Liberal Arts (p. 516). Mathematical Sciences Office: 223 Fenton Hall (716) 673 -3243 Julia Wilson, Chairperson Keary Howard, Mathematics Education Coordinator Email: mathematics.department@fredonia.edu Website: http://www.fredonia.edu/department/math/ The goal of the programs in mathematics is to prepare students for the lifelong study and use of mathem atics. The application of mathematics has made possible many of the technological advances now taken for granted. Conversely, problems in business, science and engineering, when formulated mathematically, often spur advances in mathematics. This interplay between mathematics and other disciplines has been growing and now includes many more areas than would have been thought possible only a few years ago. The Department of Mathematical Sciences offers several undergraduate program options within mathematics. The Mathematics major is recommended for those who plan to pursue graduate study in mathematics or seek general employment following graduation. Students who plan a mathematics -related career in business, industry, or science may wish to major in Applied Mathematics. For students planning a career in teaching, the department offers two majors: Mathematics Adolescence Education (p. 29), to prepare high school mathematics teachers (grades 7 through 12), and Mi ddle Childhood Education - Mathematics Specialist (p. 117), to prepare mathematics teachers for middle school (grades 5 through 9). Both teacher preparation programs lead to recommendation for Initial Certif ication in New York State. The department offers a Mathematics 7 -12 Master of Science in Education (p. 113) degree program to provide middle and high school mathematics teachers the opportunity to work towar ds Professional Certification. The department also offers minors in Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, Statistics, and Data Science, and, in collaboration with the Department of Physics, a degree program in Mathematics -Physics (p. 114). It also participates in the Cooperative Engineering program. Upon recommendation of the faculty, qualified students are invited to join the Honors Program in Mathematics. The objectives of the program are to: (1) deepen a stude nt's understanding and appreciation of mathematics; (2) provide the student with the opportunity to conduct research on a selected topic with guidance from a faculty member; and (3) enhance the student's preparation for graduate study in mathematics. The r equirements for the program are as follows: MATH 390 (Introduction to Mathematical Research, 2 credit hours); a MATH or STAT course numbered 311 or higher, to be approved by the Honors Mathematics Committee chairperson, that is an elective, i.e. not us ed to fulfill other program requirements for the student; and MATH 490 (Honors Thesis, 3 credit hours). Generally, MATH 390 is taken in the spring semester of the student's junior year, and MATH 490 is taken in the senior year. The department also offers MATH 190 Honors Problem Solving each spring to a select group of freshmen who have been recommended by their calculus instructors. Although not a formal part of the Honors Program, MATH 190 is a good course for freshmen who like working on non-trivial pro blems and wish to further develop their analytical thinking skills. Many mathematics students participate in the activities of the Mathematics Club (Chi Tau Omega). The club holds academic and social activities, and helps sponsor trips to professional meet ings. In addition, Fredonia has a chapter of Pi Mu Epsilon, a national honorary society devoted to the promotion of scholarly activity in mathematics by students. Several scholarships are awarded annually to mathematics majors based on academic performance and faculty recommendations: the Frank R. Olson Scholarship, the Earl G. Mathewson Memorial Scholarship, the Santa A. B. DiPasquale Memorial Scholarship, the Mark Buckenmeyer Scholarship, the Dr. Nelson C. & Louise A.

Recent program graduates are employed as clinical diagnostic scientists in hospit al, forensic, industrial and biotechnology laboratories; as clinical research scientists in biomedical research facilities; and as sales representatives for pharmaceutical, medical instrumentation and computer corporations. Students typically obtain jobs w ithin their discipline by the time they graduate; in most cases, they have job offers several months prior to graduation. The program is recommended for students wishing to prepare for careers as clinical diagnostic scientists in hospital, forensic, indust rial and biotechnology laboratories, and as sales representatives for pharmaceutical, medical instrumentation and computer companies. The curriculum requires the student to study three years at Fredonia and one year in an accredited clinical hospital progr am. Contracted agreements with three hospitals allow internship placement for qualified students who have successfully completed university requirements. Entrance to the clinical program is highly competitive, and generally requires a minimum 3.0 science GPA, strong letters of recommendation, and interviews. The clinical year consists of study in a hospital laboratory where students are supervised and instructed by medical technologists and physicians. After successful completion of the internship, students receive clinical certification from the hospital, 30 university credits, and the B.S. degree with a major in Medical Technology from Fredonia. Students are then eligible to take the Board of Registry exam given by the American Society of Clinical Patholog ists. Passage of the exam results in national board certification. Graduates are also eligible for licensure through the N.Y.S. Education Department Office of the Professions. The only individuals able to work as Medical Technologists in N.Y.S. hospitals a re those who have received a B.S. degree in Medical Technology and have obtained N.Y.S. licensure. The percentage of Fredonia Medical Technology students passing the Board of Registry Examination on the first attempt has been 100 percent over the past 10 years, compared to a national passage rate of only 83 percent. Under affiliation agreements entered into by the university, the training of students during the senior clinical internship takes place at the following hospitals under the supervision of clini cal Program Directors: Michele Harms, M.S., M.L.S.

Molecular Genetics majors will develop a strong background in genetics, cell biology, biochemistry, and developmental biology that will develop a strong background in genetics, cell biology, biochemistry, and developmental biology that allows students to address problems in medicine, physiology , agriculture, environmental science, industry, forensics and basic biology. Indeed, molecular genetics is playing a central role in virtually all aspects of modern biology from genes to ecosystems. Fredonia's Bachelor of Science program in Molecular Genet ics, the first of its kind in New York State, provides students with the necessary background, skills and training to enter the exciting areas of medicine, molecular biology, and biotechnology. Students enrolled in the program will gain experience in DNA c loning, fluorescent microscopy, protein biochemistry, forensic DNA analysis, bioinformatics, gene editing, and DNA sequencing, which form the backbone of molecular genetics research. Graduates in Molecular Genetics are well prepared for medical school or g raduate work in molecular biology, cell biology, biochemistry, and developmental biology, genetic counseling or forensic science as well direct employment as a research technician. The first two years of the program consist of a core of courses taken by m ost students interested in the biological sciences. The program then allows students to specialize in genetics, development, cell biology, biochemistry, and/or physiology. Many of the upper -level lab courses engage students in a research project setting. T his provides bona fide research opportunities to all students as well as comprehensive, hands -on experience with the techniques employed in modern biomedical research. The Department of Biology is particularly proud of its undergraduate research opportunit ies. Undergraduate students work closely with faculty members on original research projects (for example, see BIOL 440). Students annually present their research results at the university - wide Student Research and Creativity Exposition and at regional and national meetings. Students have been co - authors of papers published in scientific journals. A wide range of research projects are available in molecular or cellular biology, biochemistry, physiology, behavior, aquatic biology and ecology. Students interes ted in research frequently complete a capstone research project as the culmination of their undergraduate experience. Summer Research Fellowships are sponsored in biology each summer. Each sophomore or junior awarded a prestigious fellowship will work on a specific project designed in collaboration with a faculty sponsor. The fellowships are supported by the the Holmberg Foundation, Falcone Endowment, Dr. Robert Wettingfeld Endowment, Constantine Barker Memorial Endowment, Biology Endowment, and the Yunghan s-Dieter Award. Each award provides the student with a generous stipend and a supplies budget. For more information, interested students should contact a faculty sponsor in the department. Each student performs a capstone experience in their senior year. T he experience can take the form of research, an internship, a study abroad experience, or course, and provides significant learning experiences in problem solving and written and oral communication. These capstone experiences are extremely important in hel ping the student prepare for entry into professional programs, graduate school or employment. Requirements for Transfer Credit The Molecular Genetics program requires students to complete 40 credit hours of biology core courses and elective courses chosen under advisement. Students are expected to complete at least half of the biology courses at Fredonia. Additional credit hours transferred may be used as general electives toward graduation.

Its mission is to provide the resources and guidance necessary to motivate students to seek excellen ce in their individual careers in music education, performance, composition, musical theatre, music therapy and sound recording. In an environment oriented to the individual, it endeavors to create musicians who will assume vigorous roles as leaders and pa rticipants in significant musical experiences. An audition is required for admission to a degree program in the School of Music. All first -year students have essentially the same course work, and specialization increases in each subsequent year of study. All students pursuing a degree program in the School of Music take private lessons on their principal instrument (Applied Music) and will be involved in ensembles. Statement on Applied Study: A grade of \"F\" in any semester of private applied study or a grad e of \"D\" in two consecutive semesters of private applied study will result in the removal of the student from the School of Music curriculum. Statement on Ensembles: No undergraduate student will be allowed to enroll in more than two 1 -credit ensembles in a given semester. Undergraduate students enroll in up to four curricular ensembles (1 -credit and \u00bd -credit) in a semester. Any student may be asked to be in more than one 1 -credit ensemble in a semester, but they cannot be required to do so. This does no t pertain to the choral requirements for instrumental Music Education majors, as that is a requirement of the major. Each undergraduate student pursuing the General BA track as well as the MusB -Performance and MusB -Composition degree programs in the Scho ol of Music is required to audition for and enroll in a 1 -credit ensemble each semester. See below for requirements for the other BA tracks. Each undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree program in the School of Music is required to audition for and enroll in a 1 -credit or \u00bd -credit ensemble during the semesters of private applied study.

Physics Office: 112 Jewett Hall physics.department@fredonia.edu Website: http://home.fredonia.edu/physics The discipline of physics is basic among t he sciences and focuses on the study of natural phenomena. Its centrality and emphasis on problem solving makes an undergraduate degree in physics an excellent beginning for diverse careers well beyond the discipline, such as in engineering, biophysics, te chnical business, patent law, medicine, and radiation therapy to name a few. Within physics itself, research and development opportunities are growing as new fields such as nanotechnology, quantum computing, and new energy technologies mature. A steady dem and for teachers at the high school and college level provides additional attractive physics careers. Within the department students find many opportunities for independent study and research with faculty. An active student club provides additional researc h experiences, travel opportunities to conferences, and social events. Some students also engage in internships with businesses and national laboratories. The Department of Physics offers a major with concentrations in theoretical and experimental physics, a minor, a major through the 3 -2 Cooperative Engineering program, an initial certification to teach physics in secondary school (Adolescence Education - Physics (p. 30)), interdisciplinary major in Mathemat ics-Physics (p. 114), a major in Industrial Management (p. 108), and courses to complement majors in other areas. Additional Programs The Department of Physic s administers the Cooperative Engineering program and the degree program in Industrial Management (p. 108).

The American Bar Association does not recommend a particular major or set of courses to prepare for a legal education; instead, it identifies a series of skills required in law school and later as an attorney (http://www .abanet.org/legaled/prelaw/prep.html). At Fredonia, students are able to develop the reading comprehension ability, written and oral communication skills, and analytical and critical thinking skills necessary to excel in these environments. In addition, th ere are many substantive courses dealing with the law and its role in society, politics and business that will grant students greater familiarity with the law and the legal profession. Mission Statement To help students take advantage of Fredonia's curricu lum, the Pre -Law Advising Committee at Fredonia works to advise and support students preparing for a career in law and those who plan to attend law school.

Our curriculum is aligned to the learning standards and guidelines for undergraduate studies in psychology recommended by the American Psychological Association. Our curricular requirements ensure that students explore the many subdisciplines of psychology to have broad exposure to the field, while also providing flexibility. Students may specialize their degree by taking advanced elective courses offered by specialists in those fields. Our university prides itself on being student -centered and the Psychology Department exemplifies that achievement. Stude nts may learn and apply skills outside of the classroom through our Internship Program, Mentoring Program, Teaching Practicum, and student research opportunities. We have an active Psychology Club and a chapter of the Psi Chi honor society. Our department also provides opportunities for students who wish to study abroad. Students perform internships in clinical, school, counseling, and forensic settings, as well as work with organizations and family support/social services agencies. Our Mentoring Program pa irs advanced students with new students in the program to build supportive relationships to help all students succeed. Several students each semester learn about teaching and serve as learning assistants in our Psychology Lab course. We also encourage students to participate in their peer's human research studies, volunteer in a research lab, conduct empirical or library research with faculty members through independent study, be mentored by faculty in conducting their own original research, or complete an Honors Thesis. Many students have co -authored published articles and presented the results of their research at local, regional, and national conferences. The department recognizes superior student performance with the Psychology Merit Award, the Donald Jo hn Lehr Endowment, the Dr. Daniel C. Krawczyk Exemplary Award, and the Elizabeth Scorborough Psychology Scholarship. Our graduates have gone on to enjoy rewarding careers with mental health agencies, schools, hospitals, drug and alcohol treatment centers, as well as business careers such as sales, management, and human resources.

D EGREE Sociocultural and Justice Sciences Email: sociocultural.justice@fredonia.edu Website: http://home.fredonia.edu/socialwork The Bachelor of Science in Social Work is one of several major degree programs offered by the Department of Sociocultural and Justice Sciences (formerly known as the Department of Sociology, Anthropology, Social Work, and Criminal Justice). The program is accredited by the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE), the profession's educational accreditation organization. All program activities are designed to meet its mission and goals. Students must demonstrate mastery of ten core competencies for which they and the program are assessed on an annual basis. Social Work Program Mission Statement The mission of The State University of New York at Fredonia Bachelor of Science in Social Work program is to enact the mission of the university and home department, the Department of Sociocultural and Justice Sciences. Through co mmitted, quality teaching -learning activities, the program educates, challenges, and inspires students to be connected, creative, responsible, global citizens and generalist social work professionals who will advance and promote a socially and economically just world. Program Goals The goals of the Fredonia Social Work program are as follows: 1. The Fredonia Social Work program seeks to prepare generalist social workers who value the principles of service and importance of human relationships in their efforts to maintain and improve the social functioning of individuals, families, groups, organizations, communities and society. 2. The Fredonia Social Work program seeks to prepare generalist social workers who are practitioner - researchers: active, applied so cial scientists who work to strengthen and improve the well -being of others through their critical and scientific approach and enactment of the generalist problem solving method with systems of all sizes. 3. The Fredonia Social Work program seeks to prepar e generalist social workers who understand and enact the standards and core principles of the NASW Code of Ethics in their interactions, relationships and decision - making. 4. The Fredonia Social Work program seeks to prepare generalist social workers who p ractice ethnic and culturally sensitive social work practice with diverse populations and who fight to eliminate social injustice experienced by oppressed populations. 5. The Fredonia Social Work program seeks to prepare well-rounded, liberal arts trained generalist social workers who have mastered the CSWE core competencies, especially the skills and mindset needed in the use of the professional self. 6. The Fredonia Social Work program seeks to prepare generalist social workers who integrate knowledge, values, and skills for competent entry -level professional practice and/or graduate education. Program Policies The social work profession has been a leader in the cause of fighting prejudice, discrimination, and oppression against all people in society. Adm ission and advancement into the program are based upon the published criteria. Race, color, national origin, religion, creed, age, disability, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, familial status, pregnancy, predisposing genetic characteristics, milit ary status, domestic violence victim status, ethnicity, and/or political orientation play no role in the program decisions. Criminal conviction does not play a role in admission and advancement. However, criminal conviction can be an obstacle to placement in certain field agency sites. The program works with these students to find appropriate placement. Social work is also a professional field with expectations of professional behavior. Students who meet the published criteria but who have evidenced a patte rn of unprofessional, unsuitable behavior may be denied advancement and/or dismissed from the program. Students may also be dismissed from the program for academic reasons. Students must earn a grade of \"C\" or better in their required social work major cou rses to continue in the major. More specific expectations and policies are detailed in the student handbook. Assessment The program assesses students' mastery of the nine core competencies on a yearly basis. A multiple methods approach based upon students ' actual performance and written products are used in this assessment. A weighted score is created for each student and for each cohort group. The aggregate cohort scores are reported on the program web page each year and they serve as guides in curriculum discussions. Assessment patterns and trends inform curriculum decisions. 158| STATE UNIVERSITY O F NEW YORK AT FREDON IA 2020 -2021 UNIVERS ITY CATALOG Transfer Students The Social Work program welcomes transfer students. The curriculum was designed to facilitate a successful transition from other institutions. Incoming freshmen an d sophomore students are given intensive advising to prepare for advancement and to promote success in all academic pursuits. Incoming juniors who transfer with an A.A./A.S. degree or who have 60 credit hours are also given intensive advisement but they mu st meet all the advancement criteria prior to transfer. When applying for advancement into the junior year course work, these students must file their application with supporting documents and they must: 1. Be formally accepted into Fredonia for the fall semester; 2. Document the completion of 60 credit hours (or submit their plan to complete at least 60 hours before they start the fall semester); and 3. Establish equivalency for courses transferring as Introduction to Social Work (e.g., Introduction to Human Services), and Human Biology. To establish equivalency, students must submit a syllabus for the course in question to the Social Work Program Director who must determine that the purpose, content, and scope of the course is the same or similar enough to the Fredonia course that it can stand in the place of the Fredonia course. The program director may contact the college/university to gather more information to make a determination. If approved, a Transfer Credit Approval form must be filed with the F redonia Registrar. Social work courses transferred from a Council on Social Work Education Accredited program will be approved for credit but may not be judged equivalent to the Fredonia social work courses. This occurs because of differences in curriculum and course sequencing among programs. Transfer students from an accredited program will need to meet with the program director to determine equivalency. No equivalency will be granted for the Field Practicum unless placed by the program in an internationa l placement. Students earning a B.S. degree in Social Work from Fredonia must complete their 450 practicum hours through the Fredonia program. NOTE: No academic credit for life or work experience will be given as an equivalent for any course. C.S.W.E. Com petencies The curriculum is designed to help students master CSWE's nine core professional social work competencies. Each course is intentionally designed and delivered to teach the knowledge, values and skills needed to perform the practice behaviors asso ciated with each competency. In our capstone professional field education experience, students put the knowledge, values and skills into action. These nine competencies are: 1. Demonstrate ethical and professional behavior; 2. Engage diversity and differen ce in practice; 3. Advance human rights and social, economic, and environmental justice; 4. Engage in practice -informed research and research - informed practice; 5. Engage in policy practice; 6. Engage with individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities; 7. Assess individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities; 8. Intervene with individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities; and 9. Evaluate practice with individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communiti es. Advancement into the Professional Methods Sequence CSWE Accreditation Standards require programs to have admissions criteria into the major. The Fredonia program has a two tiered process. First, students are classified as \"pre-candidates\" until they have completed 30 credit hours of general education and other course work; passed Introductory Sociology, Foundations of Psychology, Human Biology and Statistics; and have a 2.0 cumulative grade point average. Upon completion of these criteria, students wi ll be considered candidates for \"Advanced Status\" in Social Work. To obtain Advanced Status, candidates must complete the second tier of the Advancement process which allows entry into the foundation professional methods courses. The professional methods c ourses are taken in a sequence beginning in the fall semester of the junior year. The second -tier of the Advancement process requires an application, a written response to a question posed on the application, three recommendations, verification that all th e prerequisite coursework and grade point average criteria are met.

Both of these degree options, more general than the Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.), provide an excellent grounding for students interested in dual majors or graduate studies in areas such as secondary education, art therapy, imaging t echnologies in the visual arts, advertising and marketing, public relations or arts administration. The Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) degree emphasizes the range of skills, theories and media necessary for the development of the designer or creative artis t. The creative process, from inception to presentation, is emphasized. This degree option fosters intellectual and creative curiosity, critical aesthetic thinking, fusion between different artistic disciplines, and extensive use and evaluation of current technologies. Visual design is of great importance, but equal consideration is given to concept and context. Critical awareness and self -evaluation are encouraged and developed. Students from other departments may also receive a Visual Arts and New Media m inor (p. 207) or an Art History minor (p. 182) to complement their major field of study. Art History majors may also consider a minor in Visual Arts and New M edia, and Visual Arts and New Media studio majors may consider a minor in Art History. Students selecting minors should consult with a department advisor in choosing courses or specific area of study. Admission to the Program Admission to the department's studio program requires the submission of an acceptable portfolio for both first -year and transfer students.

Subtotal: 20 Total Credit Hours: 20 FILM STUDIES MINOR Office: 275 Fenton Hall -3848 Shannon McRae, Coordinator Email: film.studies@fredonia.edu Website: http://home.fredonia.edu/interdisciplinary The Film Studies minor considers a variety of approaches to understanding the role of film in all its different forms and intents. A film may have predominantly literary content or may be specifically engaged with historical, political, or cultural concerns. It may also be primarily an abstract, aesthetic work, exploring alternatives to traditional narrative filmmaking. It is fundamentally a medium used to examine and study human knowledge and exploration. It is tightly interwoven into cultural identity throughout the world . The Film Studies minor acquaints students with these ideas and introduces key landmarks in the history of film while identifying and challenging the grounds on which landmark status has been recognized. The departments of Communication, English, History, World Languages and Cultures, Politics and International Affairs, and Visual Arts and New Media, and the Women's and Gender Studies, and Film Studies programs offer courses regularly that engage in the academic study of the medium. This interdisciplinary collaboration between many different departments and programs provides a wide variety of course offerings that change each semester. A variety of special topics courses may be offered at any 192| STATE UNIVERSITY O F NEW YORK AT F REDONIA 2020 -2021 UN IVERSITY CATALOG time. In any given semester, as many as 200 students may be enrol led in courses in which film is the major vehicle for study. Always check with the Film Studies minor coordinator if you have any questions about course availability. MINOR PROGRAM REQUIR EMENTS Some courses require prerequisites.

ALL MINORS | 193 GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATI ON SYSTEMS MINOR Geology and Environmental Sciences Office : 112 Jewett Hall (716) 673 -3303 Justin Conroy, Coordinator Email: geographicinformation.systems@fredonia.edu Website: http://home.fredonia.edu/interdisciplinary The objective of the Geographic Information Systems minor is to provide an interdisciplinary e ducational experience that prepares undergraduate students to use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) within their chosen fields of study. A GIS is a computer -based system, comprised of both hardware and software that enables the collection, integration, analysis, and graphic display of geographically referenced data. It is estimated that as much as 85 percent of a government agency's data is geographic, including, at a minimum, street addresses, political boundaries, postal codes, and latitude and longitu de coordinates. Private sector organizations also work with an overwhelming amount of similar kinds of data in their day - to-day operations. With so much geographically based information, GIS has become essential to the effective operation of both public an d private organizations. The minor will prepare students for careers or graduate study in virtually all areas of the public or private sector where GIS is increasingly in use and critical for efficient management, comprehensive policy analysis, cost -effect ive decision making, and GIS display and processing. The curriculum in the minor is multidisciplinary in content and interdisciplinary in approach, drawing on a variety of disciplines and departments. Service learning is incorporated into several GIS cours es and can be a focus of the GIS practicum experience. Students are strongly encouraged to attend a regional and/or state GIS conference with the GIS faculty and other students in the minor.

LATINX STUDIES MINOR Office: E304 Thompson Website: http://home.fredonia.edu/interdisciplinary O NEW AT F REDONIA 2020 -2021 UN IVERSITY CATALOG Latinx Studies, an interdisciplinary minor, takes you de la clase a la calle - \"from the classroom discussion to the realities in the streets of our diverse communities.\" The program provides an overview of the historical, political, social, educational, economic and cultural developments that affect Latinxs in the Americas. \"Latinx\" has been defined broadly to include people of Latin A merican background who reside in the U.S., where they are the fastest growing ethnic population. At a time when \"globalization\" and \"immigration\" have become part of everyday political and social discourse, students gain an understanding of the complex dyn amics of transnational communities and transculturation. One of the strengths of Fredonia's approach to the minor is our emphasis on the idea of \"de la clase a la calle\" \u2014 \"from the classroom to the streets.\" This program emphasizes taking the theoretical issues and discussions of the classroom and putting them into practical initiatives and strategies in our communities. This phrase also keeps us rooted in the origins of all Ethnic Studies programs, which emerged directly from the Civil Rights Movement and other social movements of the Sixties and Seventies. Diverse groups of students demanded a curriculum that addressed the different historical and cultural experiences of many groups in the United States. University administrators across the country, tired of the public demonstrations and sit -downs held in the middle of their campuses, allowed students and faculty to incorporate the discussions that had been taking place on the street into the curriculum. Latinx Studies is for everyone! No matter your major or your future plans, the program will provide intellectual skills and cultural knowledge that will benefit you. A minor in Latinx Studies opens doors for careers in government, legislation, international organizations, international business and marketin g, immigration laws, land management, urban planning, counseling and social work, the media, and many other fields.

In contrast, medicine focuses on the health conditions of the individual. Public health emphasizes prevention; in medicine, the emphasis is on treatment. The Interdisciplinary Studies minor in Public Health offers students the opportunity to acquire knowledge and skills in the broad field of public health, incorporating emergent issues (e.g., new public health topics such as bioterrorism and emerging infectious diseases) along with more traditional topics such as: c ommunicable and chronic diseases; maternal and child health; injuries; psychosocial issues and tobacco; mental health, substance abuse and social violence; and air, water and solid hazardous waste. The Public Health minor will facilitate private or public sector careers addressing physical, mental and/or environmental health concerns of communities and populations at risk for disease/injury, and graduate study in public health.

Opening Statement The State University of New York at Fredonia holds that the life of the mind and personal integrity go hand in hand, and are inseparable. Adherence to this philosophy is essential if we are to facilitate and promote the free and open exchange of ideas upon which our university mission relies. An essential component of the academic experience at Fredonia is the conviction tha t academic goals must be achieved by honorable means. It is expected, therefore, that all students attending the State Univer sity of New York at Fredonia will support and abide by all provisions of the following Academic Integrity Policy. It is further understood that by enrolling in courses, students are agreeing to the rules and regulations set forth below. In order to protect the value of the work accomplished by each student and instructor, our academic community depends upon certain honorable standards of behavior from all its members. Fredonia trusts all students will refrain from participating in any behavior that will inh ibit the pursuit of honest academic advancement. To help students avoid activities that can be construed as dishonest or as violations of academic integrity, a partial list of prohibited behaviors and activities is outlined below. Th is policy is not intend ed to limit decisions of faculty of professional programs that operate under more restrictive policies and/or have externally monitored procedures for addressing violations of academic integrity. II. Violations of Academic Integrity Policy Violations of ac ademic integrity are described within four broad, overlapping categories: Fraud, Plagiarism, Cheating, and Collusion. Some examples of violations of academic integrity are described in the four categories listed below. If a student has any questions about what may or may not be an academic integrity violation, the student should discuss this with their professor. A. Fraud Behaving deceptively, misrepresenting one's self or another person, and falsifying official print and/or electronic documents are actions that seriously undermine the integrity of any social institution and may result in criminal prosecution. ACADEMIC POLICIES | 521 In a university setting, fraudulent behavior includes but is not limited to: 1. Forging or altering official school documents, whether in print or ele ctronic form, such as grade reports or transcripts, enrollment documents, transfer credit approvals, etc. 2. Forging or tampering with any University correspondence or medical excuses. 3. Tampering with attendance records, such as one student signing for a nother student. 4. Tampering with or interfering with grading procedures. 5. Misreporting or misrepresenting earned credentials, including academic status, class standing, and GPA. 6. Taking an exam in place of another student. 7. Failing to disclose neces sary information on official University forms. 8. Falsely claiming that electronic systems or computer equipment is at fault for the student's inability to complete academic course work (e.g., inability to complete assignments due to problems with software or the printers/computers in a certain lab) or to complete administrative functions (e.g., inability to make schedule changes via \"Your Connection.\") B. Plagiarism Plagiarism consists of presenting the work of others as one's own. It is unethical to copy directly the words or work of other authors or artists without giving them credit. It is also unethical to rearrange or add a few words to another author's text while leaving the majority unaltered or to take an author's unique idea or discovery and to rep resent it as one's own. Specific examples of plagiarism include, but are not restricted to, the following examples: 1. Copying the work of another author and/or artist without giving proper credit in the text or reference to the artwork, presentation or pe rformance; neglecting to cite the original in a footnote; and/or failing to identify full and proper documentation in the list of works cited or sampled for presentation or performance. 2. Implying that another author's words, works, or ideas are one's own . Quoting without the use of quotation marks falsely implies originality and is, therefore, an act of plagiarism. 3. Incorporating material into a paper or assignment without acknowledgement, verbatim corrections, or other suggestions that were made by som eone other than oneself, the instructor, or an assigned editor. 4. Taking information from one source (such as the Internet) and citing it as coming from another source (such as a required text or article). C. Cheating In all academic situations, any beha vior that subverts the purpose of an academic assignment constitutes cheating, whether one actively commits the act of dishonesty on one's own behalf or enables someone else to do so. All materials prepared and/or assigned for a course by an instructor are for the students' educational benefit. *Unless expressly permitted by the course syllabus, students may not photograph, record, reproduce, transmit, distribute, upload, sell, or exchange course materials without the prior written permission of the instruc tor. \"Course materials\" includes all instructor -prepared and assigned materials, such as lectures, lecture notes, discussion prompts, study aids, tests and assignments, and presentation materials such as PowerPoint slides, Prezi slides, or transparencies a nd course packets or handouts. (Exceptions to accommodate students with disabilities may be granted with appropriate documentation.) Students are prohibited from selling to others or uploading to external commercial websites lecture notes they have prepare d in connection with a course, without the written permission of the instructor. Specific examples of cheating include, but are not limited to, the following: 1. Copying someone else's work or permitting one's own work to be copied. All work should be orig inal to the student. Whether involvement in the copying process is active or passive, these acts constitute violations of academic integrity if a student is at all complicit. 2. Using unsanctioned materials, notes, software, and or equipment (such as a pro grammable calculator). 3. Intentionally providing or seeking questions to an exam that will be given in a later section or used as a make -up exam. 4. Communicating or sharing information during an exam obviously constitutes cheating, as does taking an exam for someone else. 5. Reusing work from another course without explicit instructor permission. 6. Reusing work in a repeated course without explicit instructor permission. 522| STATE UNIVERSITY O F NEW YORK AT FREDON IA 2020 -2021 UNIVERS ITY CATALOG D. Collusion Most colleges and universities support opportunities for collaborative learning. However, unauthorized collaboration is considered collusion. Unless collaboration is expressly permitted by the instructor, students should work independently. Even when an instructor authorizes collaboration, collusion may still occur. In all ca ses, work submitted should reflect a student's individual effort. Examples of collusion include, but are not limited to, the following situations: 1. Two or more students study a problem and one student formally writes and/or types the results, the other m embers of the group copy the results, and each individual submits the work as their own. 2. A pair or larger group of students work on a series of problems or tasks, each student completes a portion of the problem set or task, the students combine their wo rk, and each student submits the entire problem set or task as his/her own. 3. A course instructor assigns a task or problem to be completed outside of class and explicitly instructs students not to discu ss the task or problem with one another. A pair or l arger group of students discuss or work together on the task or problem, and each individual submits the results as their own. III. Violations of Academic Integrity Procedures A. Classroom Level 1. An instructor who suspects a violation of the Academic Int egrity Policy will collect all information and materials related to the offense. The instructor will contact the student to present the student's charge(s) and the student will be given an opportunity to answer and explain. If the instructor and the studen t then agree that no violation has occurred, the matter is resolved and the process ends at this point. 2. If, however, the instructor finds that a violation has occurred, whether the student admits or does not admit guilt, the matt er must be reported to t heir Department Chairperson using the Academic Integrity Incident Report Form. B. Departmental Level 1. For all cases in which the instructor determines that the student has plagiarized, cheated, colluded, or committed any act of academic dishonesty, the i nstructor will submit an Academic Integrity Incident Report Form to the department chairperson. The instructor will maintain copies of all information and materials related to the offense and will disseminate the copies per request of the departmental chai rperson or the Academic Integrity Review Board. 2. After appropriate consultation and review of the materials, the chairperson and the instructor will jointly decide if the cas e is to be dismissed. If the case is not dismissed, they may attempt to resolve the case at the Department level or send the case on to the Academic Integrity Review Board. If charges are going to be brought against the student, the Department Chair will contact the Office of Student Conduct to determine if the student has a previous record of academic misconduct on file. If the student has a prior violation of the Academic Integrity Policy on file, the case must be sent on to the Academic Integrity Review Board for adjudication. The Academic Integrity Review Board will consider repeat ed violations of any or all of the provisions in the Academic Integrity Policy as grievous. 3. If the student has no prior record of academic dishonesty, the chairperson and the instructor must decide if the case is a serious enough violation to result in suspension or expulsion. If so, the case must be sent on to the Academic Integrity Review Board for adjudication. If the charges are less serious, the Department may propose departmental sanctions including but not limited to one or more of the following s anctions: a formal warning; a grade of zero being assigned to the particular performance; a failing grade being given for the course; and/or academic disciplinary probation for one semester or one year. 4. At this stage of the process, the Department Chair sends the Academic Integrity Incident Report Form to the appropriate Dean. In the case of a student enrolled in a teacher education program, this report should also be sent to the Dean of the College of Education. The Academic Integrity Incident Report Fo rm will serve as a routing slip and require appropriate signatures. C. Notification of Departmental Sanction or Referral for Hearing by the Dean 1. The Dean will communicate the proposed departmental sanctions or referral to the Academic Integrity Review B oard to the student. The Dean will also include a description of the charges to the student. A student may not drop or withdraw from a course in order to avoid a course sanction or to suspend judicial proceedings. 2. If departmental sanctions are being pro posed, the student must accept the proposed sanctions within 5 working days by signing the Academic Integrity Incident Report Form (if applicable), or appeal (See Section D) of the departmental ACADEMIC POLICIES | 523 decision. If the student does not appeal, the departmental san ctions will be imposed and the Dean will send the final Academic Integrity Incident Report Form to the academic department that originated the Academic Integrity Incident Report Form and the Office of Student Conduct. 3. Because a student may plagiarize an d/or violate the provisions of the Academic Integrity Policy in more than one department, the Office of Student Conduct will maintain the final copy of the Academic Integrity Incident Report Form in the student's file. D. Appeal Process 1. Within five (5) working days of official notification, the student may decide to appeal the departmental proposed sanctions. If so, the student must officially respond and notify the Dean (via the student's official university email account). The Dea n should then forward the notice of the student's intent to appeal to the Provost, the appropriate department chair, the Director of Student Conduct, and the Chair of the Academic Integrity Review Board, who will call together the members of the board for a formal hearing. The Director of Student Conduct will then schedule a meeting with the student for clarification of the appeal and hearing process. Throughout the appeal process, the charged student is assumed not responsible and in most circumstances, they have the right to r emain in class. 2. After the same five (5) working days, if the student has not accepted the sanctions or appealed, the University will act upon the assumption that the student has accepted the departmental decisions and any sanctions therein. 3. If the d epartment has recommended sanctions outside the departmental purview (e.g. academic disciplinary probation longer than one year, suspension or expulsion), the Chair of the Academic Integrity Review Board and Director of Student Conduct will be notified by the Dean and a hearing will be scheduled in a timely manner. All original materials for the hearing will be transmitted to the Director of Student Conduct and a copy sent to the Chair of the Academic Integrity Review Board. 4. With all decisions in the app eal process, enforcement of sanctions and notification of outcomes to all parties involved will be the responsibility of the office of the appropriate Dean. E. Academic Integrity Review Board 1. The Academic Integrity Review Board will be convened to hear and rule on a case under any of the following circumstances: a. the student who has been charged has chosen to appeal the department decision, b. for a suspension or expulsion level case, or c. whenever a second or subsequent academic misconduct violation is submitted. Before the hearing, the student will attend a counseling session with the Director of Student Conduct who will fully inform the student about the process and possible outcomes. The student may decide at this point to drop or continue with the appeal process, if that was the reason for the hearing. 2. A charged student has the right to select a willing student, faculty member, or an administrative staff member of the University to advise them throughout the review process. To avoid conflicts of interest, this advisor may not be selected from the members of the Academic Integrity Review Board. If the student wishes to have an attorney present at the hearing as an advisor, the Chair will need to be notified at least 72 hours in advance of the hear ing. The attorney may advise the student during the hearing, but will not be permitted to respond for the student. 3. The Provost will establish a pool of eligible members to serve on the Academic Integrity Review Board. These members will undergo training before serving on a convened hearing board. Members will serve for two -year terms with the option of renewal. Terms should be staggered whenever possible to provide continuity. At least one member from each category below is required to hold a hearing. A quorum of four members including at least one student representative will be selected from the following categories: a. The Chair of the Academic Integrity Review Board is a full -time tenured faculty member, appointed by the Provost and subsequently approv ed by the University Senate. The Chair's term will be two years with the option of renewal, pending reappointment and approval. The Chair of the Board will have the responsibility of determining whether a hearing should be held, convening the Board, and pr esiding over hearings. b. The Director of Student Conduct, or other representative of the Office of Enrollment and Student Services, will provide the Board access to pertinent Student Disciplinary records and will participate as an ex officio, non -voting m ember of the Academic Integrity Review Board. Before witnesses speak or before questions are asked, the representative from 524| STATE UNIVERSITY O F NEW YORK AT FREDON IA 2020 -2021 UNIVERS ITY CATALOG Enrollment and Student Services will present a brief summary of the case, based on the evidence submitted and the interview with the student. c. At least one, but preferably two, undergraduate (or graduate, if pertinent) student representatives. These two students should have majors in different academic units. Students may be selected from the pool of students serving as Campus Judici al Board members. d. A chairperson from an academic department other than the department in which the charge originated. e. At least one faculty member, but preferably two, from departments other than the department initiating the charges and the departmen t chair serving on the committee. Such members may be selected from the pool of faculty serving as members of the Campus Judicial Board. 4. Other parties and witnesses may be invited by the Chair of the Academic Integrity Review Board or by the student. Th ese witnesses may be called before the Academic Integrity Review Board to provide testimony. Normally, the faculty member bringing the charges is also invited to the hearing to answer any questions that arise. 5. After the presentation of the summary of t he case by the Director of Student Conduct, the student will answer to the charges by pleading responsible or not responsible. The Chair of the Academic Integrity Review Board (after prior consultation with the assembled Board) may call witnesses. The stud ent who has been charged may also call witnesses. All participants in the hearing will be informed that deliberations are to remain strictly confidential. Hearings of the Academic Integrity Review Board will be recorded to provide a record of the proceedin gs and these recording will be stored in the Office of Enrollment and Student Services. 6. After the hearing, the Academic Integrity Review Board will deliberate in private and make a formal decision. In the final determination, each of the members of the acting board, including the Chair of the Board, and excluding the Director of Student Conduct, will cast a single and equally weighted vote. In the event of a tie vote concluding a case, the Chair of the Board will cast an additional vote. Voting will be c onducted by written ballot, and will be tallied by the Chair of the Board. The results will be disclosed to acting Board members, who are not to disclose either the board's determination or any specifics related to the voting. 7. Within one week of the f inal determination of the case, the Chair of the Academic Integrity Review Board will complete a written hearing report and will send electronic copies to the Provost and the Dean that referred the case. The final report o f the Academic Integrity Review Bo ard will include the following: a. A determination of \"Not Responsible\" (no violation of the Academic Integrity Policy has been found) or Responsible (the student has been found responsible for the charged violation on the basis of the evidence submitted o r has admitted guilt). b. If the student has been found \"Responsible\" for violating the Academic Integrity Policy, the penalty must be specified. Sanctions or penalties imposed should be commensurate with the offense and will take into account any previous violations of the Academic Integrity Policy as evident in the student disciplinary records on file. 8. The Provost will send an official notification letter informing the student of the hearing outcome, sanctions imposed, if any , and an explanation of the appeal process. A copy of this letter will also be sent to the Director of Student Conduct. If the student has been suspended or expelled, a copy of the official letter will also go to the President's Office. On the same day the Review Board's decision is communicated to the student by the Provost, the instructor, chairperson in whose department the charge originated, chairperson of the student's major department, and the Vice President for Enrollment and Student Services will be informed of the board's de cision electronically (i.e. via Fredonia e -mail). If the student is a teacher education student, the Dean of the College of Education will also be notified. 9. Should the student decide to appeal the Academic Integrity Review Board's decision, he or she ma y do so in a written justification to the President of the University, but only if/when the substance of the presented case has changed (i.e., additional and significant new evidence is discovered) or if there has been some sort of procedural error that wo uld affect the outcome of the hearing. The written appeal must be received within 5 working days following the student notification of the hearing outcome. F. Maintenance of Academic Integrity Records Records of all academic integrity violation cases will be kept in the Office of Enrollment and Student Services for 10 years. ACADEMIC POLICIES | 525 Academic Standing and Probation The term \"in good academic standing\" means that a student is eligible or has been allowed to register for and und ertake academic course work for the term in question. The mechanism of academic probation, including any accompanying constraints upon a student's activities, is intended merely as an educational device to encourage greater effort on the part of students w ho appear to be having difficulty in meeting certain academic standards. Placement on academic probation may precede denial of the right to register for academic course work if certain conditions are not met, but a student on academic probation is consider ed to be in good academic standing. Any question concerning whether or not an individual student is in good academic standing will be determined by the campus committee on academic standards. The Academic Standings Committee has adopted the following regul ations governing academic standing: 1. A student will be placed on probation if the cumulative quality point average falls below a 2.00. A student on academic probation is required to meet with a probation advisor (generally the chairperson of the studen t's major department) a minimum of three times during the probationary semester. 2. Probationary status is determined in accordance with the above standards and is not dependent upon official notification. 3. \"Good academic standing\" is defined as maintain ing a cumulative quality point average at or above the appropriate level in (1) above or being on probationary status. Students should also refer to the financial aid section on academic standing and its relationship to financial aid eligibility. 4. A stu dent normally will be required to withdraw if at the end of a semester of probation the cumulative quality point average is still below the level stated above. 5. Students on probation whose record of achievement becomes academically irreparable may be dis missed. At the close of each semester, a student whose cumulative quality point average places them within the range of Academic Dismissal will be notified via \"Your Connection.\" Students may appeal this dismissal to their department chairperson/program director, through an online process in \"Your Connection\". The Academic Standings Committee then reviews the appeals of each student. The Academic Standings Committee is comprised of the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs (or designee), the As sociate Provost for Curriculum, Assessment, and Academic Support, the academic deans, the Vice President for Enrollment and Student Services (or designee), the Coordinator for Academic Advising & Liberal Arts and the Registrar. The decision of the Academi c Standings Committee is final. Chosen Names The State University of New York at Fredonia (Fredonia) recognizes that many persons identify themselves using a name that is different from their legal name. Fredonia will refer to this na me as the \"Chosen Name\" and will use it when possible in the course of university activities. Your legal name will still be accessible to university personnel when it is necessary to carryout the duties of the instituti on. Whenever possible, an F# should b e collected. If names conflict, check the F# to confirm an individual's identity. Any participant in the chosen name program who directs an outside agency to correspond with the State University of New York at Fredonia bears the responsibility for clarifyi ng their name with all agencies. Your Chosen Name will appear in the following areas: Student Health Center Counseling Center ID card (FREDCard) Class rosters Learning management system (OnCourse) Student, faculty, staff portal (Your Connection ) Student Information System Email address 526| STATE UNIVERSITY O F NEW YORK AT FREDON IA 2020 -2021 UNIVERS ITY CATALOG Advising folders Campus Directory Residence Life Directory Commencement programs Diploma Library Athletics Your legal first name will continue to appear in the following areas: Transcripts Paychecks and pay stubs Financial Aid records Tax Documents Human Resources records Any off campus communications (such as any letters sent to a permanent address, communication with emergency personnel, licensing boards) ACADEMIC POLICIES | 527 Adopting a Chosen Name Any person with an F# can request to use a chosen name. Students, faculty and staff may make no more than two requests to change their Chosen Name within a 365 -day period. Students, faculty, and staff who would like to enroll should contact jennifer.hildebran d@fredonia.edu. Although an individual may select any Chosen Name, the university reserves the right to deny or remove a Chosen Name if it is inappropriate or used for an improper purpose. Inappropriate Chosen Names include but are not limited to those th at avoid legal obligation, misrepresent, harass, threaten, or are otherwise objectionable. In most cases, a Chosen Name should not be a message, company, or group name, especially if it is for promotional purposes. Individuals with a Chosen Name deemed inappropriate can either select a different Chosen Name or continue to use the legal name. Click for more information about Fredonia's Chosen Name policy. Click to read answers to Frequently Asked Questions. Obtaining a New Fredonia ID Card Students, faculty and staff who adopt a Chosen Name must obtain a replacement ID card within two weeks of the change. While students, faculty and staff may change their Chosen Name more than once, they are entitled to only one free replacement card. The individual is respon sible for any replacement card charges associated with subsequent changes. Chosen Names Policy Title: Chosen Names Policy Contact: Director, Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Passed by University Senate: 1-27-17 Approved by Cabinet: 8-23-17 I. Reason for Policy Chosen names can be vitally important to our students, faculty, and staff for a variety of reasons. For those within the LGB TQ community, they allow the use of a name that properly expresses one's gender ide ntity. In some cases they help individuals avoid reminders of past trauma. They allow international students to use a westernized name that makes them feel more comfortable in their new setting. Whatever reason an individual has for using a chosen name , this policy communicates to individuals that they are welcome and valued on our campus; it can be a vital tool in recruitment and retention strategies. II. Policy Statement Fredonia recognizes that many persons identify using a name that is different f rom their legal name.

Attendance is expected in all classes. Some courses will require attendance. Some courses will base a part of the grade on attendance and participation. Other cours es will have no formal requirements con cerning attendance. Instructors will indicate the attendance policy as a part of the course syllabus. It is the student's responsibility, if absent, to find out what material was covered, what assignments were given, and what announcements were made in cla ss during the period of absence. Because the university is concerned about the welfare of its students and wishes to provide assistance in case of absence for valid reasons, students are encouraged to notify the Office of Enrollment and Student Services in the event of an unusual series (three or more consecutive days) of absences due to serious health issues or personal reasons. The office will then notify instructors. Each instructor is responsible for establishing a policy concerning cases in which regul arly scheduled graded work is missed and for determining whether the reason for having missed such work is valid. If the instructor determines that a student has a valid reason for missing the work, the instructor may choose to give the student an opportun ity to make it up or may, in exceptional cases, base the grade for the course on other work. In the event of a disagreement over the validity of the absen ce, the student may appeal to the instructor's chairperson. When a student is directly participating i n a university -sponsored program that takes him/her away from classes (e.g., athletics or research conference), the department sponsoring the program will provide the student with documentation indicating the activity in which the student is involved and t he date(s) and time(s) of that involvement. Such participation will be considered a valid reason for missing the work. Thus, instructors should offe r the student an opportunity to make up the work or may base the grade for the course on other work. In the event of a disagreement over the validity of the absence, the student may appeal to the instructor's chairperson or supervisor. If a student anticipates having to miss regularly scheduled graded work, the student should contact the instructor ahead of t ime. The instructor may expect the student to complete the work before the scheduled time when that is feasible. If a student must be absent due to religious beliefs, he/she has the right to make up examinations, etc. In the same vein, professors may feel com pelled to cancel an in -person class session to attend a religious observance or professional conference. Students might be asked to complete alternate assignments for that particular class session. Course Auditing Subject to faculty and department approval, certain academic courses may be audited. The instructor is under no obligation to assess a course auditor's homework, class contributions, or examinations. The auditor receives no grade for the course, nor i s any course transcript generated by The State University of New York at Fredonia. In addition, auditors are not provided certain other university services, such as email, internet access, etc. However, access to OnCourse is available as needed. Once enrolled, students may not c hange their enrollment status from audit to credit, or from credit to audit. Any person wishing to audit a course must obtain and complete an Audit Form from Extended Learning - whether a fee is required or not. The completed form must have the approval an d signatures of: the chair of the department offering the course, and the course instructor. Current full -time students, faculty and staff, Fredonia emeriti faculty and staff, and community members 60 years of age and older (with documentation) may audit c ourses without paying a registration fee. For all others, a non -refundable fee of $50 will be charged. Audit privileges are not available in noncredit courses offered through Extended Learning, nor in any internship, directed study, practicum, OpenSUNY, or international study program/course. Course Challenge Option Students may enter the university already possessing the skills or knowledge taught in a particular university course. If suc h a course is required or is a prerequ isite for other courses, and if the students can prove to the satisfaction of the department offering the course that they indeed possess the skills or knowledge in question, the requirement will be waived or the stude nts will be placed in the course for w hich they qualify, without receiving credit for the prerequisite or required course. In unusual cases, academic departments may be willing to grant college credit for a given course to students who can demonstrate prior knowledge of the course materials or skills. The course in question will not be one in which the classroom process itself is an important focus, as it is in courses dependent on small group discussion or problem -solving, computer work, laboratory experiments, group projects, and the like. To \"challenge\" a suitable course by demonstrating that one can pass the ACADEMIC POLICIES | 531 course without taking it, a student must first apply to the chairperson of the department offering the course. The applicatio n should include a detailed description of the manner in whic h the student has already met the goals and objectives of the course. If the chairperson deems the course available for challenge and if he or she believes the student's application to have merit , the department will determine the manner in which the stude nt is to demonstrate his or her knowledge and/or proficiency. If, in the department's opinion, the student's performance is adequate, the chairperson will recommend to the Registrar that the student be awarded credit for the course. No grade will be given, and the student's quality point average will not be affected. Semester Credit Load Undergraduate students must be registered for at least 12 credits for full -time status. The normal credit load for most undergraduate programs is 15 or 16 per semester. A student who wishes to register for more than 18 credit hours must secure the approval of their department chairperson/program coordinator, subject to the following restrictions: Students on academic probation are not permitt ed to register for more than 18 credits. Students in good standing with a GPA less than 3.00 may request permission to register for up to 21 credits. Students with a GPA of 3.00 or higher may request permission to register for up to 24 credits. Any ex ceptions to the above restrictions must be approved by the Associate Provost for Curriculum, Assessment, and Academic Support, 809 -810 Maytum Hall. Course Prerequisites and Corequisites Many courses offered by the university are open to any interested student, space permitting. However, some courses have prerequisites - other courses or test scores a student must have had before taking the course in question. A few courses have co-requisites , which must either be taken before or together with the course in question. Information about pre- and co- requisites , and other recommended experiences, is given in the course description section found elsewhere in this catalog. Students are responsible for ensuring that any prerequisites have been met before enrolling in a course. Course Repeat Policy A student may repeat a course and have the prior grade(s) excluded from the calculation of their cumulative quality point average if the course is an exact equivalent (subject and course number) of the previous course taken. A course originally taken for a grade cannot be re -taken on a pass -fail basis. A student who wishes to repeat a course at another college and have the grade excluded for a course already taken at Fredonia must secure prior approval from the chairperson of his or her major program (or department of advisement) and have the chairperson certify that the course to be taken is the equivalent of the course the student wishes to repeat. For this option, transfer credit is accepted only if the student earns a \"C\" or better for the course being repeated and transferred. In that case, the credit (not the grade) will be noted on the transcript. The option of using transfer credit for course r epeat may not be utilized by students who have been academically dismissed, unless the student is reinstated and completes courses leading to a degree program at Fredonia. When courses are repeated, the prior grade(s) will remain on the transcript, but an \"E\" will appear to the right of the prior grade(s) earned, indicating that this grade is excluded from the grade point average calculation. Dean's List About one month after the end of each semester, the university announces the names o f students who are recorded on the Dean's List. The list includes all students who have earned a semester quality point average of 3.30 or higher with a course load of at least 12 credit hours. (Courses with P or S grades are not included in the 12 hours.) Field of Study Definitions and Declaration Definitions: Major : A major represents a student's primary field of study for those pursuing a registered degree program. A major is a structured plan of study requiring a minimum of 30 credit hours. It must be feasible for students to complete degree 532| STATE UNIVERSITY O F NEW YORK AT FREDON IA 2020 -2021 UNIVERS ITY CATALOG requirements within the minimum 120 credit hours required for an undergraduate degree. The major appears on the transcript but does not appear on the diploma. Minor : A minor is a structured plan of study requiring a minimum of 18 credit hours. A minor should require significant additional coursework beyond what is already required for a related major. The minor appears on the transcript, but does not appear on th e diploma. Concentration/Track: A concentration/track is a structured plan of study within a major. The number of credit hours for a concentration varies, but is included within the credit hours for the major. The concentration/track appears on the transc ript but does not appear on the diploma. Declaration Procedures and Information: Students who wish to declare or change their field of study must obtain the appropriate form from the Office of the Registrar and secure the signature of the department cha irperson or program coordinator of the intended additional major, minor or concentration/track. The declaration of major program, as well as changes in the major, minor or concertation/track, should be made well in advance of course selection and at leas t a semester prior to the date of graduation. The chairperson responsible for departmental programs or the coordinator responsible for interdisciplinary programs will assign students an advisor and will certify at the appropriate time that all program r equirements have been completed. Students may declare a major before earning 30 semester hours of credit, except in some professional programs, and must make the declaration of program prior to earning 60 semester hours of credit. Certain major progra ms have a minimum quality point average requirement for admission. Students should check with the department of their intended major for specific minimum GPA and/or course requirements. Students are generally not permitted to earn multiple degrees, nor d eclare multiple majors, from the same academic department. Exceptions include the following: Biology with Biology Adolescence Education; Chemistry with Chemistry Adolescence Education; Communication (all majors); Computer and Information Sciences (all majo rs); History/Social Studies; Geology with Earth Science; Mathematics with Mathematics Adolescence Education; Applied Mathematics with any other Mathematics major; Music (all majors); and Physics with Physics Adolescence Education or Industrial Management. Students who are interested in declaring more than one minor program are to follow the procedure outlined above. Disability Support Services: Policies and Procedures It is university policy th at students with disabilities fulfill the same degree and program requirements as all students, and that reasonable accommodations may be used to assist students with disabilities in attaining those requirements. In addition, the university may offer non -accommodative services such as tutoring and counseling. Reasonable accommodations and other services are determined on a case -by-case, course -by-course, and semester -by-semester basis. It is the responsibility of students with disabilities to identify thems elves by notifying the Coordinator of Disability Support Services. The student and coordinator will meet and discuss the student's needs, on the basis of the clinical diagnosis that has established the existence of the disability, and will decide on the ki nds of assistance and/or reasonable accommodations the student will need to gain equal access to the university's programs, activities and services. It is advised that students sel f- identify upon admittance to the university in order to provide a seamless transition. Early self -identification can facilitate reasonable accommodations and other services that may be delayed by the process of obtaining appropriate documentation with later self -identification. To receive such services, the student must meet with the Coordinator of the DSS office and fill out an intake form. The Coordinator and the student will then meet and assess which services will be available to the student. It is important to note that Fredonia does not have a shuttle service between classes , nor does the campus provide transportation expenses to allow students to get to class. With the student's written request, the coordinator will inform the relevant professor(s) or office(s) of the student's accommodation needs for the particular class or service the accommodation is needed. The coordinator will be confirming the existence of a disability and the need for the accommodations requested. The student must then identify him/herself to the professor or office providing the accommodation, and whe re necessary, discuss the accommodations or alternative accommodations. In the event of a disagreement between the student and the professor or office about the need for the requested accommodation, the Coordinator of Disability Support Services will serve as mediator. ACADEMIC POLICIES | 533 Fredonia is prepared to respond to the individual needs of students with disabilities. For specific information about service s and facilities for students with disabilities, students should contact Jennifer Ruhland, Coordinator of Disability Support Services, Reed Library (fourth floor), by telephone at (716) 673 -3270, or by email at disability.services@fredonia.edu. Final Examinations Final Exam Schedule - A tentative schedule of final examinations is available on t he Registrar's web pages. Requests from instructors for deviations from the schedule (group examinations or room changes) must be approved by the Registrar. The Registrar's office will publish a final schedule, including group exams, at least three weeks p rior to finals week. Once this schedule has appeared, no changes can be made. Final examination week is part of the regular semester and should be interpreted in that context. Students who are asked to t ake final examinations (variously interpreted as term inal, non -comprehensive, etc.) prior to the regular examination week are put at a decided disadvantage. Faculty members who do not give final examinations during the regular period scheduled for such examinations are expected to use that period for review or to utilize the time in some formal way in a classroom setting. All students have the right to take their final examination at the time scheduled by the Registrar's office. Three -Finals -In-One-Day Conflict - It is university policy that students not be r equired to take three final examinations in one day. However, the published final examination schedule may contain some three -finals -in-one-day conflicts. In this situation, a student has the right to take one of the examinations on a different day. If the conflict arises due to an individual professor rescheduling his/her final examination from the time initially scheduled by the Registrar's Office, it is the responsibility of that professor to arrange for an equivalent examination for the studen t at a suitable time during examination week. If a suitable time is not agreed to, the student may appeal to the chairperson of the department in which the course is taught. If the conflict arises due to the scheduling of a group examination for several sections of the same course, the department scheduling the group examination must make equivalent examinations available to students for whom the scheduled group examination creates a three -finals -in-one-day conflict. When a student finds that a group examination creates such a conflict, he/she shall meet with the chairperson of the department scheduling the group examination who will arrange for the equivalent examination to be given to the student at a suitable time during examination week. If a suitable time is not agreed to, the student may appeal to the dean responsible for the area in which the course is taught. If a conflict arises from neither of the above reasons and if a student is taking one of the three courses in his/her major f ield, it is the respons ibility of that instructor to arrange for an equivalent examination to be given to the student at a suitable time during examination week. If a suitable time is not agreed to, the student may appeal to the department chairperson. Students should resolve an y three -finals -in-one-day conflicts before the beginning of examination week. Grade Appeals A student who feels that a final grade reported to him/her is incorrect has the right of appeal. This appeal must be initiate d within one seme ster after final grades are posted, using the following procedure: 1. He or she first discusses the grade with the instructor. 2. If, after this discussion, the student is still unsatisfied, the student may take his or her case to the chairperson of the department. This appeal should be in writing, outlining the reasons why the student feels the initial grade was incorrect and supplying any relevant documentation (e.g. graded material, syllabi, etc.) in support of the grade change. 3. If the chairperson dec ides that the student's case merits further investigation, and after the chairperson has discussed the appeal with the instructor involved, the chairperson appoints an ad hoc committee composed of two members of the faculty in the department, other than th e faculty member involved, and one student who is a major in the department. 4. If the chairperson decides that the student's case does not merit further investigation, the student may appeal this decision to the dean, supplying the same supporting materia ls as presented to the chairperson. If, after discussion with the chairperson, the dean decides that the student has a case that merits investigation, the dean may appoint an ad hoc committee of the same composition to that described above to investigate t he student's case. 5. The committee reviews the case, interviews the student and the instructor separately, and reaches a judgment by majority vote. The judgment is communicated to the chairperson or the dean who, in turn, reports it to the affected partie s. 534| STATE UNIVERSITY O F NEW YORK AT FREDON IA 2020 -2021 UNIVERS ITY CATALOG 6. If the committee recommends a change in grade, the instructor may initiate a change, or the committee's recommendation is forwarded to the appropriate dean or Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs for their consideration. In such cases, the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs may modify the grade if the committee so recommends. 7. At any time during this process prior to when a final decision is made, the student may withdraw his/her appeal, or the instructor may initiate a grade change consistent with the student's appeal. Either of these actions ends the appeal process. For information on graduate grade appeals, please see \"Graduate Grade Appeals (p. 604)\" in the Graduate Studies section of the catalog. ACADEMIC POLICIES | 535 Grading System Student transcripts are updated at the conclusion of each semester, summer session, or special term. The symbols used to reco rd achievement on the permanent record card of the student at the e nd of each semester are as follows: A Excellent A- B+ B Very Good B- C+ C Fair C- D+ D Passing D- F Failing I Incomplete, given when a student, because of illness or other cogent reasons, is unable to complete the requirements of the course. These requirements must be satisfied before the end of the next regular semester or an earlier date set by the instructor; otherwise the I becomes an F on the permanent record. A student wishing to be considered for an I grade in a course must contact the instructor before the end of the semester, and submit the Request for Incomplete form available on the Registrar's Web page. If the instructor determines that an I grade is appropriate, then the instructor will determine the deadline for comple ting the work for the course, and the grade the student would earn if the missing work is not completed. Once the work for the course has been received by the instructor, the instructor should submit the student's revised grade for the course to the Regist rar's office within two weeks. IP In Progress. Assigned to the original thesis/capstone course and will remain on the student's transcript until (s)he completes the course. P Satisfactory completion of courses under the Pass -Fail Option. \"P\" does not cou nt as part of the cumulative quality point average or total; it does, however, count toward completion of total credit hours earned. NP Unsatisfactory (Not Passing) completion of courses under the Pass -Fail Option. \"NP\" does negatively impact the cumulati ve quality point average. NR Grade not reported by faculty member. E Indicates course has been repeated, and will appear on a student's transcript to the right of the original grade earned. This symbol is also used to exclude grades not calculated due to an approved Academic Forgiveness Policy. S Satisfactory completion of requirements. The S does not count as part of the cumulative quality point average. U Unsatisfactory performance or failure. The U does not count as part of the cumulative quality poi nt average. Note: The letters S and U are used for student teaching and certain other courses, including some independent study and skill courses. In contrast to Pass/Fail, Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory grades are given as departmental options for certain courses, and require that the instructor prepare an appropriate supplemental evaluation of each student's performance to be filed with the department. W Indicates withdrawal from the university. WC Withdrawal from a course. 536| STATE UNIVERSITY O F NEW YORK AT FREDON IA 2020 -2021 UNIVERS ITY CATALOG X Indicates continuing enrol lment in a course that continues past the end of the semester. An X grade that has not been converted to a credit -bearing grade by the end of the second regular semester after the semester for which the X was given will change to an F grade. Y Indicates a course completed with a grade of C - or better during a semester accepted for \"academic bankruptcy.\" Credit is awarded for such courses but the grades are not included in the student's average. Prior to Fall 2009, the Y represents all passed courses during a bankruptcy semester. Z Indicates a course completed with a grade of D+ or lower during a semester accepted for \"academic bankruptcy.\" Credit is not awarded, and grades are not included in the student's average. Prior to Fall 2009, the Y represented fa iled courses during a bankruptcy semester. Graduation with Honors Students whose cumulative quality point average indicates high scholastic attainment will be awarded the degree as follows: 1. Summa Cum Laude - Quality Point Average 3.7 or higher. 2. Magna Cum Laude - Quality Point Average between 3.50 and 3.69. 3. Cum Laude - Quality Point Average between 3.30 and 3.49. Students may graduate with honors only when they have completed at least 45 hours of graded work at Fredon ia. Graded work includes all courses which carry quality points and excludes courses which are graded \"satisfactory -unsatisfactory\" or \"pass - fail.\" Only those credits earned at Fredonia will be computed in the final average. Leave of Absence Policy and Con tinuing Enrollment A leave of absence may be obtained for the following reasons: medical, military service, or jury duty. In most cases, a stude nt must have a minimum 2.0 cumulative grade point aver age and at least a 2.0 average in his/her major. The purpose of a Leave of Absence is to permit the student to return without applying for readmission. A leave of absence form can be obtained from the Office of Academic Advising Services on the 4th floor R eed Library. Or at this link https://www.fredonia.edu/academics/academic -advising/leave -absence Ordinarily, a leave is for one semester or one academic year. Students wishing to return after a leave of absence must contact the Registrar's office at least o ne month before the beginning of the semester in which they wish to enroll. A student who voluntarily terminates enrollment from the university may return to the university through reinstatement or readmission. Legal Name Changes A student whose name is legally changed should report the change in writing to the Registrar along with a photocopy of a lega l document (driver's license, court order, social security card) reflecting the new name. Liability The universi ty is not responsible for loss or damage to personal property by fire, theft, or any other cause on university property or in any off -campus housing facility. Observance of Regulations and Standards All stude nts are expected to observe the regulations and standards governing student life, both in and out of the classroom. Failure to do so may be considered grounds for suspension or dismissal. Each student should read with care the full statement on Student Rig hts and Responsibilities (p. 617). ACADEMIC POLICIES | 537 Pass -Fail Option The Pass -Fail Option permits a student, with the advisor's approval, to take certain courses and earn a grade of P (Passing) or F (Failing), rather than a traditional letter grade (A,B,C,D). Quality points will not be used for pass -fail courses when the student receives a passing grade. However, a failing grade will carry the usual penalty for failure in a course. The following cours es may NOT be taken Pass -Fail: Courses at the 100 -level Courses that are part of the professional semester Courses required for a major, a minor or the General Education Program Departments may designate other courses as not applicable to the pass -fail option; such courses are identified in the online Course Schedule each semester. Within the limitations given, students may enroll for courses as free electives on the pass -fail basis: 1. Completion of a minimum of 39 semester hours toward the bachelor 's degree is required before enrollment in pass -fail courses. 2. No more than 16 semester hours may be taken on a pass -fail basis; no more than two such courses may be taken in any one semester. All courses taken as pass -fail are counted towards the 16 hou r maximum whether the student receives a P or an F. 3. In the event a student transfers to a department in which he or she has taken a pass -fail course, the student may petition the Registrar to rescind the pass/fail option for the course. Pass-fail applic ations are available in the Office of the Registrar. A student who decides to enroll on a pass -fail basis is required to obtain his or her advisor's signature on the application within the three -week period following the beginning of the semester. He or sh e may not thereafter change status in the course(s). Permission to Take Graduate Courses While an Undergraduate Undergraduates who have completed 90 credit hours and whose grade point avera ge is 3.0 or better may be allowed to enroll in suitable graduate courses numbered 500 -599. Permission is not automatic, however; in each instance, students must request approval of the department offering the course and of the Associate Provost for Gradua te Studies. The forms for this purpose may be found in the Registrar's office or online at http://www.fredonia.edu/gradstudies/forms.asp. Students may use such graduate courses either to meet undergraduate degree requirements or to meet degree requirements in a Fredonia graduate program they enter at a later time. In the latter case, a student will be charged the difference between undergraduate and graduate tuition when the credit is applied to the graduate transcript. No course may be used for both purpos es by the same person. In no case will an undergraduate be allowed to enroll in a course numbered 600 or above. 538| STATE UNIVERSITY O F NEW YORK AT FREDON IA 2020 -2021 UNIVERS ITY CATALOG Grade Point Average The quality point system is used to indicate a student's overall academic average. Each course grade of: A carries 4.0 quality points per semester hour A- carries 3.7 quality points per semester hour B+ carries 3.3 quality points per semester hour B carries 3.0 quality points per semester hour B- carries 2.7 quality points per semester hour C+ carries 2.3 quality points per semester hour C carries 2.0 quality points per semester hour C- carries 1.7 quality points per semester hour D+ carries 1.3 quality points per semester hour D carries 1.0 quality points per semester hour D- carries 0.7 quality points per semester hour Course grades of F, P, S, NP and U carry no quality points . The grade point average for a semester is determined by dividing the total quality points earned by the number of hours carri ed that semester; the cumulative grad e point average, by dividing the total quality points accumulated to this point in the student's university career by the total number of hours carried, including courses failed. Hours earned for courses with P and S grades are not included in figuring the semester or cumulative average; hours failed (grade of F and NP) are. Students should consult each individual department on its policy for calculating grade point average in the major or minor. ACADEMIC POLICIES | 539 Readmission and Reinstatement Students who have withdrawn from the university and wish to return may obtain an application for Readmission/Reinstatement from the Office of The Registrar. Applications are reviewed by the appropriate academic dean and department chairperson and must be in good financial and judicial standing. Reinstatement Students who return to the university after an absence of one calendar year or less, and who left the university in good acad emic standing (defined by a GPA of 2.0 or higher, and not on academi c probation) are eligible to be reinstated. A student who has been reinstated will keep the major(s), minor(s), and/or concentration he or she had at the time of separation from the university. However, such students may be given a one -semester probationar y status within the major program, if the major requires a higher level of academic achievement to be considered \"in good standing.\" Students Readmission Students who have left the university either on probation or because of Academic Dismissal, or who h ave been absent from the university for more than one calendar year, will need to apply for readmission. The student's application for readmission wil l be reviewed by the appropriate dean and the department chairperson or program director of the major into which the student seeks readmission. Registration While the university provides enough courses and seats for each accepted student to register for, a full schedule of courses each semester pertinent to their academic objectives and in partial fulfillment of degree requirements, it cannot assure a desired time schedule, a preferred instructor, or a given course. The university reserves the right to cancel any course for which the enrollment is deemed insufficient or for other administr ative reasons. The university also reserves the right to change faculty assignments and therefore cannot guarantee students the faculty of their choice. Early Registration is held during the latter part of the regular spring and fall semesters preceding th e semester for which enrollment is sought. The exact dates of early registration will be announced by the Registrar through e -mail and the Registrar's web page, and in campus publications. Students wishing to register must meet with their academic advisor and discuss their academic plan for the upcoming semester. Students will then register according to published guidelines. In addition to participating in the Early Registration period, all students must confirm registration by paying the appropria te tuitio n and fees, according to the directions issued by the Office of Student Accounts. In compliance with the regulations of the Board of Trustees of the State University, students who have not satisfied their financial obligations to the university will not be permitted to register. Registration must be completed by the end of the first week of classes. A service charge of $40 is imposed for registrations taking place after the third day of classes. Changes in student class schedules must be made via the Intern et within the first two days of the fall or spring semesters, or filed in the Office of the Registrar within the period prescribed by that office. NOTE: Course Add/Drop/Withdrawal deadlines published in the university calendar are for full semester cours es; deadlines are pro-rated for courses that meet less than a full semester. Students may drop courses through the first week of the semester. Those courses dropped will be removed from the student's permanent record. After the drop deadline, students may withdraw from a course. A fee of $20 will be assessed for each course added after the established add deadline. Transactions involving a switch from one section of a course to another will be charged one $20 fee. Following the drop deadline and ending with the withdrawal date published by the Registrar each semester, a student may withdraw from a course after consultation with their advisor and course instructor. A grade of \"WC\" is assigned. The withdrawal grade will be recorded on the student's permanent r ecord but will not be counted in the student's quality point average. Through the second week of the semester, an instructor of a course may petition the Registrar to have a student dropped from a course. This may be done if the student has not been attend ing classes, and there are other students wishing to add the course. When an instructor initiates such action, the Registrar will make an effort to contact the affected student, and, if the stud ent wishes to remain in the course, the student will be allowe d to do so, subject to approval by the instructor. 540| STATE UNIVERSITY O F NEW YORK AT FREDON IA 2020 -2021 UNIVERS ITY CATALOG Students will not be permitted to withdraw from courses after the withdrawal deadline published by the Registrar. Exact dates for the add, drop and withdrawal periods are given in the university calendar a nd are posted on the Registrar's web pages, and apply to all full -semester courses. ACADEMIC POLICIES | 541 Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree Students are responsible for ensuring that they have met all degree requirements, including general education requirements and requirements for majors, minors and concentrations. As students approach the completion of 75 credit hours, they are encouraged to use the online degree evaluation available through \"Your Connection.\" Department chairpersons will work with students who have questions about the results of the audit, to make sure progress is being made towards completing degree requirements. Graduation from the university with the award of the appropriate degree (Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Science in Education, Bachelor of Fine Arts, or Bachelor of Music) will be granted to students who fulfill the following requirements. 1. They must earn a minimum of 120 unduplicated credit hours. 2. They must complete all required courses in a particular major program, the General Education requirements of the General Education Program, and sufficient elective credits to make up the total required credit hours, with a minimum cumulative quality point average of 2.00. The s tudent must also have a minimum cumulative quality point average of 2.00 in courses required for his/her major, minor, and concentration. Students should see department sections for any variation from this requirement. 3. Except for certain programs, stud ents pursuing the B.A. or B.S. degree must earn a minimum of 66 hours in credits from disciplines other than their major discipline. For either the B.A. or B.S., students in multi -discipline major programs may not apply more than 45 hours in any one discip line toward credits needed for graduation. 4. All students must take a minimum of 45 semester hours at Fredonia. In order to count towards this requirement, a course must be taught by a SUNY Fredonia faculty member. This shall include courses taught by Fr edonia faculty via distance education and up to 15 credits earned through study abroad under the INED subject code. 5. Under ordinary circumstances, students will have 10 consecutive years during which to complete the requirements for the undergraduate de grees in effect at the time they began their studies. If they wish to complete the degree after 10 years, their record of studies will be reviewed by the chairperson of the academic department in which their major falls, and by their academic dean, to dete rmine how much of their earlier credit is still applicable. This rule applies not only to credit earned at Fredonia, but also to credit transferred to Fredonia from other colleges or universities. In addition, after 10 years, studen ts will generally be req uired to complete the current General Education Program requirements. The student's record of studies will be reviewed to determine how much of his/her earlier general education credit is still applicable. This policy notwithstanding, to the extent that ce rtifying agencies change the requirements for a particular degree within the student's original 10 -year period or later, students will be bound by the new requirements of the agency. 6. Candidates in a program leading to certification to teach in New York State must satisfactorily complete all student teaching requirements. No grade less than S gives credit in student teaching. 7. Music students must meet certain accompanying and performance standards, and secondary Instrument competencies. Details on thes e requirements may be secured from the School of Music. 8. Students must meet all their financial obligations to the university and any or all of its supporting agencies. 9. A student who expects to graduate at a given date must make application through the Registrar's office, not later than the third full week of classes of the final semester of attendance. 10. All students seeking an undergraduate degree must complete 45 credit hours at the upper -level (300 level courses and above). Please see your advi sor for additional information regarding courses that will satisfy this requirement. NOTE: Only 4 credit hours of physical education activities courses (100 -level courses) may count toward the total number of credit hours needed for graduation. Not mor e than 6 credit hours of arts ensemble courses (e.g., MUS 021 -047, DANC 110) may be counted toward the total number of credit hours needed for graduation, unless this rule is overridden by a requirement/limit stipulated by the student's major. A maximum of 24 credit hours of internship credit may count toward the number of credit hours needed for graduation. 542| STATE UNIVERSITY O F NEW YORK AT FREDON IA 2020 -2021 UNIVERS ITY CATALOG Credit for a course may not be counted more than once, unless the course has been designated by the department as an exception to this rule. Requir ements for a Second Baccalaureate Degree 1. Some students will complete two major programs, but in most cases will only earn one degree. Fredonia students wishing to earn two separate degrees concurren tly must complete a minimum of 150 semester hours and complete the requirements for the two degrees during the semester in which they have applied for graduation. The two degrees may not be of the same type as registered by the New York State Education Dep artment. For example: a B.A. and a B.S. would be appropriate, but two B.A. degrees would not, as the latter can be accomplished in the declaration of a second major. 2. Fredonia graduates seeking an additional bachelor's degree after conferral of the first degree must take a minimum of 30 semester hours at the university and must successfully complete the requirements of their additional major or program. 3. New students seeking an additional bachelor's degree must take a minimum of 45 semester hours at Fre donia, to meet the residency requirement, and must successfully complete the requirements of their additional major or program. 4. A minimum of 15 credit hours must be successfully completed in the discipline of the second degree program. Of these 15 credi t hours, no more than 3 credit hours may be taken as an independent study or internship. The department chairperson of the proposed degree program will prepare a written contract outlining the required courses, prior to admission to the program. 5. The stu dent must have a minimum cumulative quality point average of 2.00 in all courses required for the second degree and in courses required for the second major or program. Students should see the department sections for any variation from this requirement. 6. Students must meet all their financial obligations to the university and any or all of its supporting agencies. 7. A student who expects to graduate at a given date must make application through the Registrar's office, not later than the third full week o f classes of the final semester of attendance. Course Numbering System Courses numbered from 100 to 499 are open to undergraduates. In general, courses numbered 100 -199 are taken in the freshman year, courses 200 -299 in the sophomore year, courses 300 -399 in the junior year, and courses 400 -499 in the senior year. There are, however, some variations in this placement according to curriculum and other factors. Courses numbered from 500 to 599 are graduate courses open to quali fied seniors for undergraduate credit by permission of the appropriate chairperson. Courses numbered from 600 to 699 are open to graduate level students only. Class Level Definitions Students are given class designation acc ording to the number of credit hours successfully completed, as follows: Freshman fewer than 30 credit hours Sophomore 30 or more and fewer than 60 credit hours Junior 60 or more and fewer than 90 credit hours Senior 90 or more credit hours Student Ide ntity Verification in Online and Distance Education Courses Online classes at Fredonia are offered through the campus -supported Learning Management System (LMS). Students are required to log in to the system using their campus -assigned student eServices User I.D. account retrieved from the Student Information System Self -Service Portal (Your Connection). The credentials for Your Connection are issued to the student upon applying to the institution. When the institution receives the student's paid admissions deposit the student's eServices User I.D. and password is provisioned. Enrollment information is transferred from the campus Student Information System (SIS) to the LMS to ensu re that students have access to all (and only those) courses for which they are enrolled. ACADEMIC POLICIES | 543 Student Identity Verification Access to the LMS is controlled by the student's eServices user I. D./password, and official communication with the student i s through a campus -assigned email account. The student's eServices User I.D. account credentials are retrieved through the Student Information System Self -Service Portal (Your Connection). This interface provides Fredonia students initial access to user-specific info rmation, including User I.D. and password information for use of electronic resources and computing facilities at Fredonia. The login credentials to Your Connection utilize the student's Fredonia I.D. (FID) as the UserID and an assigned PIN for the initial PIN. The student is forced to change the PIN immediately upon logging in for the first time. Students must provide ID when requesting password resets at the ITS Help Desk (or answer a series of challenge questions when making the request by phone). All ac counts are generated by Fredonia - students do not self -enroll in any online -access accounts. Protection of Student Privacy All processes related to the verification of student identity for online course access are automated, protected by campus informatio n security and privacy policies and procedures, and in compliance with FERPA regulations. Such information security provisions include secure authentications and connections to electronic resources, password integrity guidelines, password complexity and le ngth requirements, self service password resets, required account security questions, and various levels of encryption. Charges Associated with Identity Verification There are no charges to students associated with identity verification. Responsibility for Identity Verification Information Technology Services is responsible for the consistent application of the automated electronic processes related t o student identity verification for online courses. Student Responsibility for Safeguarding Credentials Students are responsible for safeguarding their student accounts and for all activity associated with those accounts. Sharing of login credentials with the intention of anyone other than the registered student completing course work is considered a viola tion of the Academic Integrity Policy and Computer and Network Usage Policy. Transcripts of Record Upon written request from the student, the Registrar will provide an official transcript. Students are urged to request trans cripts well before the date they are needed. (For information on changes to transcripts, see Student Appeals of Grades (p. 533).) Transfer Credit Enrolled students must secure prior approval from the chairperson of their major program (or department of advisement), from the chair of their minor, if applicable, and from the Registrar, before credit taken at another college or university will be transferred to the student's record at Fredonia. S tudents applying for such approval should provide the chairperson and Registrar a copy of the course description from the other college catalog. Transfer Credit Approval forms are available in th e Office of the Registrar. Students who have been required to withdraw from the university may not complete degree requirements by taking courses at another college, unless they are subsequently readmitted and enrolled in courses leading to a degree program at Fredonia. Credit for non -collegiate sponsored instructio n will be awarded upon the recommendation of the appropriate dean, following consultation with department chairpersons as appropriate. Where applicable, the guidelines found in College Credit Recommendations (published by the Board of Regents/State Educati on Department) should be followed. Credit will be subject to these limitations : 1. It is to be considered transfer credit. 2. It is elective credit. 3. A maximum of 12 credit hours may be counted toward graduation. 4. Consistent with university policy, phy sical education credit should be limited to 4 credit hours. 544| STATE UNIVERSITY O F NEW YORK AT FREDON IA 2020 -2021 UNIVERS ITY CATALOG Upper Level Requirement All students seeking an undergraduate degree must complete 45 credit hours at the upper -level (300 level courses and above).

To be eligible for consideration you must be a New York State resident and have earned a high school diploma or its equivalent. To be considered \"financially eligible,\" you must meet the economic criteria established by the New York State Education Department. Check the current SUNY Application Guidebook for the updated economic criteria listed under EOP in the booklet.

Transfer applicants receive consideration if they have previously been enrolled in a similar EOP/HEO P/College Discovery/SEEK program.

Good Academic Standing and Receipt of Undergraduate Financial Aid Requirements State and federal regulations require that all financial aid recipients maintain program pursuit and make satisfactory academic progress toward completion of degree program requirements. The Financial Aid Office at Fredonia evaluates student aid academic progress according to state requirements fo r TAP, SUNYTC, SUSTA, APTS, and PTAP at the completion of each semester and according to federal requirements for SEOG, PELL, TEACH, Work Study, Direct Stafford and Direct Plus loans at the completion of the academic year. All three criteria in the charts below must be met in order to retain financial aid for the following semester. If a student withdraws from a course, it may affect his/her aid for the next semester.

Repeated Courses Courses in which the student has already received a passing grade cannot be included in meeting f ull-time study requirements for state -sponsored financial aid. Repeated courses may be counted toward full -time study requirements if a student repeats a failed course, if a student repeats the course for additional credit, if a student has received a grad e that is passing at the institution but is unacceptable in a particular curriculum, or when a student repeats a previously withdrawn course. Notification Procedure The Financial Aid Office will notify the student within one month after the conclusion of t he Fall semester if good academic standing requirements were not met while the student received State aid, and within one month after the Spring semester while the student received State aid. The letter will inform the student of loss of aid at Fredonia fo r the semester immediately following the one in which the program pursuit and satisfactory academic progress standards were not met and will also appris e the student of the waiver procedure to follow if the student feels financial aid should be reinstated. Waiver Procedure A request to reinstate State aid for the next semester at Fredonia will be evaluated and granted only if exceptional circumstances (e.g., family illness or death, personal illness, personal emotional disturbances, other unusual circumstan ces) can be documented by the student. Waivers of the Good Academic Standing criteria and reinstatement of aid are not automatic. They are approved only if in the best interest of the student and only if unusual circumstances prevented the student from 558| STATE UNIVERSITY O F NEW YORK AT FREDON IA 2020 -2021 UNIVERS ITY CATALOG meeting the expected criteria. A waiver to reinstate State aid is available only once during undergraduate study (with the exception of \"C\" average waiver). The waiver request form is mailed with the notification of aid loss to the student by the Financial Ai d Office. A student choosing to use the waiver process to reinstate their aid for that semester at Fredonia must complete and submit the waiver form along with appropriate documentation to the Office of Financial Aid for evaluation by the published deadlin e.

Students should be aware that course repeats do not count as a completion in determining Good Academic Standing. Part-time students enrolled beyond 12 semesters (up to 24 semesters maximum) must continue to complete 100 percent of hours attempte d and maintain a 2.0 GPA. As a rule, students should always check with the Financial Aid office when considering a withdrawal from courses or the university. Federal Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) Final regulations published in the Federal Register o n October 29, 2010 (668.16 and 668.34) by the U.S. Department of Education require institutions that participate in the student financial aid programs under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended to (the HEA), to implement new guidelines, effective July 1, 2011; tied to the annual Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) review for federal student aid. Fredonia conducts a review of Satisfactory Academic Progress tied to the receipt of federal student aid on an annual basis, at the completion o f the Spring semester. If a student fails to achieve satisfactory academic progress at that time, the institution may not award and disburse federal Title IV program funds to the student. Incompletes and WD's Effective July 1, 2011, GPA and pace of complet ion are affected by course incompletes and withdrawals. Transfer courses must count as both attempted and completed hours when measuring quantitative progress. Financial Aid Probation This will be a new status assigned to a student who fails to meet the Sa tisfactory Academic Progress review at the completion of the Spring semester, who has appealed that determination via the institutional Waiver process, and has subsequently had eligibility for federal aid reinstated. This status will be assigned for a sing le consecutive payment period and the student will receive Title IV funding while in this status. At the end of that payment period, the student must meet the institution's SAP standards or meet the requirements of the \"academic plan\" that may have previou sly been developed by the institution to qualify for further federal aid. The institutional SAP Waiver Policy and Use of Academic Plans is based on the following set of procedures: A student will be notified within four weeks at the conclusion of the Spr ing semester if they fail to meet federal Satisfactory Academic Progress requirements. If the student chooses to appeal the loss of federal student aid for the subsequent semester, they must submit a letter and include supporting documentation with the Waiver Application that supports the reason for failing to meet federal Satisfactory Academic Progress requirements by the published deadline. ADMISSIONS AND FINAN CIAL AID | 559 The basis on which a student may file an appeal are the death of an immediate family member, student illness, illness of a family member, and/or other personal and emotional difficulties, and/or other unusual cirucumstances. The Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) Waiver Committee will review the documentation and either approve or deny the Federal Waiver req uest and will subsequently notify the student via electronic means. If the federal aid waiver is approved, and the student has an overall GPA below a 2.0, they are placed in a Financial Aid Probation status for the semester in which they are requestin g their aid be reinstated for. Once in a Financial Aid Probation status, a determination will be made as to whether or not a student could meet the required SAP standards after the subsequent payment period and if not, the Advisor/Department Chair will develop an \"academic plan\" in collaboration with the student to ensure that the student meets Federal SAP standards by a specific point in time. The \"academic plan\" then becomes the students mandate to meeting federal Satisfactory Academic Progress requir ements in place of the standard federal SAP Chart. 2020 -2021 University Costs N.Y.S.

Refund/Repayment of Financial Aid Due to Discontinuance of Study When a stu dent has received Title IV federal funds (such as: Subsidized/Unsubsidized Stafford loans, PLUS Loan, PELL grant, SEOG grant, TEACH grant) and discontinues study prior to the completion of the semester for which the Title IV funds were disbursed, a Title I V repayment calculation must be completed. A student's charges will be reduced based on the refund policy. The purpose of the repayment calculation is to determine the amount of Title IV federal aid the student is eligible for and insure that the student h as not been over awarded federal financial aid due to the student's withdrawal. The initial step in the calculation is to identify all of the Title IV federal aid that the student was awarded in the semester that the student withdrew. If a student is subje ct to the 30 -day delayed disbursement, as a first time borrower, and withdraws during the first 30 days, the student is not eligible for the Stafford Loan, and it will not be inclu ded in the calculation. The next step is to determine the number of days the student was enrolled for the semester and divide that by the total number of days in the semester to calculate the percentage of Title IV federal aid earned by the student. If this percentage is grea ter than 60 percent, the student is eligible for 100 per cent of their Title IV federal funds. (Note: Any break of five or more consecutive days is excluded from the calculation. For example: Thanksgiving and Spring Break would be excluded.) If the percentage of Title IV federal aid earned is less than or equa l to 60 percent, the percentage is then multiplied by the amount of Title IV federal aid the student has been awarded for the semester. This determines the amount of Title IV federal aid that the studen t is eligible for and can be applied toward their char ges for the semester they withdrew. A comparison is done between the amount of Title IV aid that the student is eligible for and the amount that has already been disbursed into the account. If the disbursed amount is less than the eligible amount, any addi tional funds up to the eligible amount may be disbursed to the student's account and then to the student if any excess funds are available. If loan proceeds are to be utilized as a late disbursement, the student (or parent for a PLUS Loan) will be notified . If the disbursed amount is greater than the eligible amount, the student has been over awarded due to their discontinuance of study. When a student has been ove r awarded, the amount of earned aid is subtracted from the amount of disbursed aid to determin e the amount that the student is not eligible for. Any Title IV federal aid that the student is not eligible for must be returned to the appropriate federal p rogram. Title IV federal aid is returned in the following order: Unsubsidized Stafford Loan, Subsi dized Stafford Loan, PLUS Loan, PELL grant, Federal SEOG grant, TEACH grant and other Title IV program aid excluding Federal Work -Study. For additional information regarding the repayment of Title IV federal aid, persons should contact the Student Accounts Office at (716) 673 -3236, 306 Maytum Hall, or email student.accounts@fredonia.edu. State University Refund Policy Tuition. A student withdrawing from the university or individual courses during the fall or spring se mester is eligible for the following tuition refunds: 100 percent for withdrawal during the first week of classes 70 percent for withdrawal during the second week of classes 50 percent for withdrawal during the third week of classes 30 percent for withdraw al during the fourth week of classes 0 percent for withdrawal beyond the fourth week of classes A full refund of tuition may be granted if a student must withdraw for reasons beyond his/her control with the approval of th e University President or his/her d esignee. The College Fee is not refundable after registration. ADMISSIONS AND FINAN CIAL AID | 567 Refunds for the Student Services and Programs Charge are granted based on the week of withdrawal following the same schedule listed above for tuition. Please note that Thanksgiving and Spring Break do not count as a week during the semester in the Title IV aid calculation. As a rule, students should always check with the Financial Aid office when considering a withdrawal from courses or the university. Student Services and Programs Charge The Student Services and Programs Charge combines all university fees for student services, programs and activities in one composite amount for all students.

SARA is an agreement among member states, districts and territories that establishes comparable national standards for the approval of interstate postsecondary distance education courses and programs. On September 13, 2016, the New York State Board of Regents adopted new regulations requiring out -of-state institutions of higher education to seek and obtain New York State Education Department (NYSED) approval to o ffer distance education to New York State residents, and to permit the Department to enter into the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (SARA). New York State joined SARA on December 9, 2016. New York State institutions participating in SARA are auth orized to conduct distance education activity in other SARA member states under the terms and provisions of SARA. Please refer to the National Council for State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements (NC -SARA) website for more information about SARA eligibil ity, coverage, and procedures. A list of states and institutions participating in the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement is available on the NC -SARA Directory webpage. Complaint Resolution Federal regulations require institutions delivering distance education courses to provide students and prospective students with contact information for filing complaints with the state approval or licensing entity in the student's state of residency and any other relevant state official or agency that would approp riately handle a student complaint. SARA requires the College to provide all students taking courses under SARA's provisions with information on the College's and SARA's complaint resolution policies and procedures. SARA applies solely to distance educatio n activity conducted across state lines. It does not apply to distance education activities inside New York State. Only those complaints resulting from distance education courses or activities offered to students in other SARA states come under the terms o f SARA. Complaints from instate students are to be resolved under the College's provisions, not those of SARA. All Fredonia students taking distance learning courses should first follow the campus procedures for attempting to resolve complaints. Students r esiding in state's other than New York may, after exhausting campus procedures, file complaints according to the policies of the state in which they reside.

State University Refund Policy Click here for the policy (p. 553) Licensure/Certification Completion of one of our certificate/licensure programs will prepare qualified candidates for licensure/certification in New York State. The State University of New York at Fredonia is able to deliver online programs through the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (SARA) process. SARA is an agreement among member states, districts and territories that establishes comparable national standards for the approval of interstate postsecondary distance ed ucation courses and programs. New York State joined SARA on December 9, 2016. New York State institutions participating in SARA are authorized to conduct distance education activity in other SARA member states under th e terms and provisions of SARA. Please refer to the National Council for State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements (NC- SARA) website for more information about SARA eligibility, coverage, and procedures. A list of states and institutions participating in the State Authorization Reciprocity Ag reement is available on the NC -SARA Directory webpage. New York State also participates in the National Association of State Directors of Teacher Education and Certification (NASDTEC). This interstate agreement makes it possible for an educator who complet ed an approved program and/or who holds a certificate or license in one jurisdiction to earn a certificate or license in another state or jurisdiction. Fredonia has not currently made a determination if this program will specifically meet licensure/certifi cation requirements of any state other than New York. You are encouraged to contact the appropriate state licensing body in your state with any questions relating to professional licensure or certification as each state is responsi ble for its own certifica tion/licensure requirements. Additionally, licensing/certification requirements vary by state and relocating could impact whether you will meet eligibility requirements for licensure. Check with the state licensing agency where you 578| STATE UNIVERSITY O F NEW YORK AT FREDON IA 2020 -2021 UNIVERS ITY CATALOG desire licensure before relocating to ensure that you will be eligible for licensure or reciprocity.

D and F grades do not carry credit toward a master's degree but are included in the cumulative average. The S grade (satisfacto ry) is reserved for courses that are not readily evaluated by the usual letter designations. Any course in which S or U (unsatisfactory) grades are used would be so designated by the department when offered. S grades carry no quality points and hours earned with an S grade a re not included in figuring the semester or cumulative average. Hours failed with a U grade are added into the total hours for the grade point average. A maximum of 6 credit hours with grades of S may apply to the requirements for the master's degree. Each semester hour of A carries four quality points; B, three quality points; C, two quality points; and D, one quality point. Incompletes must be removed before the end of the succeeding semester; otherwise the I automatically will become an F on the permanen t record. An X grade that has not been converted to a credit -bearing grade by the end of the second regular semester after the semester for which the X was given will automatically change to an F grade.

Academic deficiencies comprise poor course performance, a course grade below 3.0 GPA, a cumulative GPA below 3.0, or other academic deficiencies as identified by the student's dep artment and program. Non-academic deficiencies comprise poor professional disposition, ethical violations, or other personal issues that interfere with program performance. Departments are charged with identifying students with deficiencies by midterm of e ach semester and at the conclusion of each semester. As well, program coordinators should ensure that remediation plans for each probationary student are in place and submitted in accordance with department, college and university policy. Graduate students pursuing a degree are required to maintain a minimum grade point average of 3.0. At the end of each semester as part of a graduate Academic Standings process, the records of all degree students are reviewed. Each student with a cumulative average below 3. 0 will be placed on academic probation for one semester. The purpose of the probationary semester is to give the student sufficient warning of academic danger. A student is considered to be in good academic standing even while on probation. If, at the end of their next semester, students have not re -established the required average, they may be required to withdraw from the university. There may be exceptional circumstances that would affect a student's ability to regain the required academic average at the end of one semester. Students under such circumstances may seek the support of his/her advisor and the chairperson of the major department in appealing the required withdrawal. Graduate Assistants will maintain an overall minimum 3.0 GPA per semester of f unding . Students whose semester GPA falls below that or who carry grades of Incomplete beyond the mid -point of the following semester will potentially incur tuition repayment charges. GAs may not use a tuition waiver to repeat courses for which they did no t earn a passing grade. Students who fail to establish minimum expectations for good standing within 5 years, including reinstatement, may be subject to academic dismissal. Exceptional circumstances will be reviewed by the program coordinator, chair, dean and the Associate Provost for Graduate Studies. Graduate Grade Appeals A graduate student holds the rights to be treated in a nondiscriminatory manner and to file a grade appeal. If the graduate student claims that an earned grade is based on discrimination, the student must file the discrimination claim first with the office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Upon resolution of the discrimination claim, the student may file the grade appea l. Students who believe that a cou rse grade or other grade reported is incorrect has the right of appeal by the following procedure within one semester after final grades are posted. They must first discuss the grade with the instructor. If the student is still unsatisfied after the di scussion with the instructor, they may appeal in writing to the department chairperson. The appeal must outline the reasons the student feels the initial grade was incorrect and must include any relevant documentation (e.g. graded material, syllabi, etc.) in support of the grade change. If the department decides that the student's case has merit, an ad hoc committee composed of two members of the faculty in the department (other than the faculty member involved) and one other graduate student in the depar tment will be appointed. The committee will review the case, interview the student and the instructor separately, and reach a judgment by majority vote. This judgment will be communicated to the department chairperson and who will notify the student and th e instructor of the decision. If the department chairperson decides that the student's case does not merit further investigation or if the student disagree s with ad hoc committee's judgment, the student may appeal this decision to the Associate Provost f or Graduate Studies and the college Dean. The student must supply the same supporting materials as those given to the department chairperson. If, after discussion with appropriate faculty and/or administrators, the Associate Provost for Graduate Studies and the college Dean decide that the student has a case that merits investigation, the Associate Provost for Graduate Studies, in consultatio n with the college Dean, may appoint an ad hoc committee of the same composition as that described above for the purp ose of investigating the student's case. The investigative committee will review the case, interview the student and the instructor separately, and reach a judgment by majority vote. This judgment will be communicated to the Associate Provost for Graduat e Studies who will notify the student, instructor, and department chairperson and dean. GRADUATE STUDIES AND STUDENT SERVICES | 605 If a change of grade is recommended by the committee, the instructor may initiate the change, or the committee's recommendation will be forwarded to the Associate Pro vost for Graduate Studies and the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs for their consideration. The Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs may modify the grade if the committee so recommends. At any time during this process prior to t he time a final decision is made, the graduate student may withdraw their appeal; likewise, the instructor may initiate a grade change consistent with the students appeal at any time during the process. Eith er of these actions ends the appeal process. Grad uate Course Repeat Policy Graduate students may retake up to two courses during a single degree program in order to improve the final course grade(s). The Graduate Course Repeat Petition may be obtained from the forms section of the Graduate Studies website. If the petition is approved, neither the previous course grade nor its earned credit will count toward the student's cumulative GPA or overall credit hours. A single course may be retaken only once and must be compl eted within two years after the completion of the original course. Tuition waivers may not be used to pay for a repeated course. Exceptional circumstances will be reviewed by the coordinator, chair, dean and the Associate Provost for Graduate Studies. Howe ver, students who cannot complete courses in a timely manner as determined by the program may be subject to academic dismissal. It is important to note that although the initial grade will remain on the student's academic transcript, the overall quality point average will be re -calculated based on the new grade earned for the repeated course. Policy on Continuous Enrollment Purpose The purpose of the Continuous Enrollment policy is to provide a mechanism for allowing continuous usage of university resources (library, advising, network privileges, etc.) during periods of sustained research and scholarship and to account f or student enrollments and faculty involvement in capstone and theses projects not completed within the semester in which the student is registered for the final capstone course. Definitions \"Continuous Enrollment\" is defined as a 1 -credit hour graduate course for which a graduate student is required to register during semesters following a capstone cour se until completion of thesis/capstone work. Grading A grade of 'IP' (In Progress) will be assigned to the original thesis/capstone course and will remain on the student's transc ript until the student either completes the work or fails to complete the thes is/capstone work within five years of admission to the degree program. A final grade for the original thesis/capstone course will replace the 'IP' grade upon completion of the work . A grade of 'S' (Satisfactory) or 'U' (Unsatisfactory) will be assigned to each extension course for which the student enrolls. Student Responsibilities The student and capstone/thesis advisor must complete the Graduate Work Completion Contract, indicating the specific work that remains to be done and an agreed -upon date for comp letion. The form must be sent to the Graduate Studies office; a copy will be sent to the Registrar, to the student's department chair, and the appropriate Dean's office. Restrictions A student is not eligible for academic leave for the purpose of thesis/c apstone completion once work on thesis/capstone research has begun. If a student must suspend work on the research for compelling reasons, students must formally withdraw from the graduate degree program and apply for reinstatement when they are prepared t o complete the thesis/capstone project. Withdrawing from a graduate degree program curtails student usage of university resources, including the faculty advisors involvement in the research project. Reinstatement to a graduate program following a leave of absence requires Department, Dean and Associate Provost for Graduate Studies approval. Statute of Limitations Policy No course taken more than 7 years prior to application for a current master's degree program will be considered for credit toward the new degree. Departments are responsible for scrutinizing past graduate credit earned at Fredonia to determine the appropriateness of transferring such credit toward a current graduate degree. Any coursework for which the st udent earned a grade lower than 'B' will not be accepted. Other credit will be accepted at the discretion of the student's department. 606| STATE UNIVERSITY O F NEW YORK AT FREDON IA 2020 -2021 UNIVERS ITY CATALOG The department may consult with the Associate Provost for Graduate Studies if they wish to include credit older than 7 ye ars.

The following rules and regulations were amended in December 2004 and May 2015. They were approved by the College Council and the University President in May 2015. Attendance at Fredonia is a privilege afforded the student by the State of New York and not a legal right. The determination of a student's fitness to be admitted to the University and to continue as a student has been en trusted by the Board of Trustees of the State University to the President and their staff. The term \"student\" or \"students\" include all persons taking or auditin g classes at Fredonia, both full -time and part -time, pursuing undergraduate, graduate, or profe ssional studies; matriculated in any University program. Persons who are not officially enrolled for a particular term, but who have a continuing student relationship with the University are considered \"students.\" General Policy Students seeking knowledge and understanding also need freedom to inquire, to exchange ideas through discussion, publication and public presentations. These opportunities are basic to education in and for a democratic society. To ensure these freedom s, the Uni versity requires a community free from violence, threats, and intimidation; protective of free inquiry; respectful of the rights of others; open to change; supportive of democratic and lawful procedures; and dedicated to the rational and orderly approach t o the resolution of human problems. In exercising freedoms and in discharging the rights and obligations of citizenship, students must also recognize their responsibilities to other individuals, to the University, to the state and th e nation, and to societ y in general. Orderly and dignified expression and conduct are encouraged. In protection of these freedoms the University must establish certain standards of personal and group conduct. The University may apply sanctions or take other appropriate action wh en the conduct of individuals or groups on or off campus directly or significantly interferes with the freedom to teach and learn, the safety and health of persons in the community, the maintena nce or protection of property, the provision of living accommo dations and other services, and the sponsoring of non -classroom activities such as lectures, concerts, athletic events, and social functions.

Nothing herein is intended, nor shall it be construed, to limit or restrict the freedom of speech or peaceful assembly. Free inquiry and free expression are indispensable to the objectives of a higher educational institution. Similarly, exp erience has demonstrated that the traditional autonomy of the educational institution (and the accompanying institutional responsibility for the maintenance of order) is best suited to achieve these objectives. These rules shall not be construed to prevent or limit communication between and among faculty, students, and administration, or to relieve the institution of its special responsibility for self - regulation in the preservation of public order. Their purpose is not to prevent or restrain controversy an d dissent but to prevent abuse of the rights of others and to maintain that public order appropriate to a college or university campus without which there can be no intellectual freedom and they shall be interpreted and applied to that end. 2.

The chief administrative officer shall be responsible for the enforcement of these rules (or of the rules of any individual institution supplementing or implementing these rules) and shall designate the other administrative officers who are authorized to take action in accordance with such rules when required or appropriate to carry them into effect. b. It is not intended by any provision herein to curtail the right of students, faculty, or staff to be heard upon any matter affecting them in their relations with the institution. In the case of any apparent violation of these rules (or of the rules of any individual institution supplementing or implementing these rules) by such persons, which, in the judgment of the chief admi nistrative officer or their designee, does not pose any immediate threat of injury to person or property, such officer may make reasonable effort to learn the cause of the conduct in question and to persuade those engaged therein to desist and to resort to permissible methods for the resolution of any issues which may be presented. In doing so such officer shall warn such persons of the consequences of persistence in the prohibited conduct, including their ejection from any premises of the institution where their continued presence and conduct is in violation of these rules (or of the rules of any individual institution supplementing or implementing these rules). c. In any case where violation of these rules (or of the rules of any individual institution sup plementing or implementing these rules) does not cease after such warning and in other cases of willful violation of such rules, the chief administrative officer or their designee shall cause the ejection of the violator from any premises which they occupy in such violation and shall initiate disciplinary action as hereinbefore provided. d.

Communication . In matters of the sort to which these rules are addressed, full and prompt communication among all components of the institutional community, faculty, students, and administration, is highly desirable. To the extent that time and circumstances permit, such communication should precede the exercise of the authority, discretion, and responsibilities granted and imposed in these rules. To these ends each state -operated institution of the State University shall emp loy such procedures and means, formal and informal, as will promote such communication. 9.

The notice of charges so served shall fix a date for hearing thereon not less than 10 nor more than 15 days from the date of service which shall be the date of mailing where necessary to effect service by mail. Failure to appear in response to the charges on the date fixed for hearing, unless there has been a continuance for good cause shown, shall be deemed to be an admission of the facts stated in such charges and shall warrant such action as may then be appropriate thereon. Before taking such action the hearing committee, hereinafter referred to, shall give notice to any student, who has failed to appear, in the manner prescribed in subdivision (c), of its proposed findings and recommendations to be submitted to the chief admini strative officer and shall so submit such findings and recommendations 10 days thereafter unless the student has meanwhile shown good cause for his/her failure to appear, in which case a date for hearing shall be fixed. e.

The chief administrative officer may, upon the service of charges, suspend the student name d therein, from all or any part of the institution's premises or facilities, pending the hearing and determination thereof, whenever, in their judgment, the continued presence of such student would constitute a clear danger to them self or to the safety of persons or property on the premises of the institution or would pose an immediate threat of disruptive interference with the normal conduct of the institution's activities and functions; provided, however, that the chief administrative officer shall grant an immediate hearing on request of any student so suspended with respect to the basis for such suspension. g. There shall be constituted at each state -operated institution a hearing committee to hear charges against students of violation of the rules for maintenance of public order prescribed by or referred to in this Part.

Any five members of the committee may conduct hearings and make findings and recommendations as hereinafter provided. At any institution where the chief administrative officer determines that the number of hearings which will be required to be held is, or may be, so great that they cannot otherwise be disposed of with reasonable speed, the individual may determin e that the hearing committee shall consist of six members of the administrative staff and six members of the faculty to be designated by the chief administrative officer and of six students who shall be designated by the members so designated by the chief administrative officer. In such event the chief administrative officer shall designate one of such members as chairperson who may divide the membership of the committee into three divisions each to consist of two members of the administrative staff, two fa culty members, and two students and may assign charges among such divisions for hearing. Any four members of each such division may conduct hearings and make recommendations as hereinafter provided. h. The hearing committee shall not be bound by the techni cal rules of evidence but may hear or receive any testimony or evidence which is relevant and material to the issues presented by the charges and which will contribute to a full and fair consideration thereof and determination thereon. A student against wh om the charges are made may appear by and with representatives of their choice. The student may confront and examine witnesses against them and may produce witnesses and documentary evidence on their own behalf. They may be present at the hearing: the stud ent charged and their representatives and witnesses; other witnesses; representatives of the institutional administration; and, unless the student shall request a closed hearing, such other members of the institutional community or other persons, or both, as may be admitted by the hearing committee.

University Policies Listed below are policies the universi ty has adopted to ensure the health, safety and well -being of the University community. 626| STATE UNIVERSITY O F NEW YORK AT FREDON IA 2020 -2021 UNIVERS ITY CATALOG Acceptable Use Policy -Information Technology I. Reason for Policy Access to information technology is essential to the mission of the State University of New York at Fredonia (\"Fredonia\") in providing Fredonia students, faculty and staff with educational services of the highest quality. The pursuit and achievement of the SUNY mission of education, research, and public service require that the privilege of the use of computing systems and software, internal and external data networks, as well as access to the Internet, be made available to all those of the Fredo nia community. The preservation of that privilege for the fu ll community requires that each faculty member, staff member, student, and other authorized user comply with institutional and external standards for appropriate use, whether on campus or from remote locations. II. Policy Statement To assist and ensure com pliance with internal and external acceptable usage standards, Fredonia establishes the following policy which supplements all applicable Federal and State policies, including harassment, patent and copyright, student and employee disciplinary policies, an d FERPA, as well as applicable federal and state laws. A. Scope The following document outlines Fredonia's policy on Fredonia -provided access to electronic information, services, computing facilities, and networks. All creation, processing, communication, distribution, storage, and disposal of information by any combination of Fredonia resources and non -Fredonia resources are covered by this policy. Technology resources covered by this policy include, without limitation: All Fredonia owned, operated, leas ed or contracted computing, networking, information resources, whether they are individually controlled, shared, standalone or networked, All information maintained in any form and in any medium within the Fredonia's computer resources, and Fredonia data networks, All physical facilities, including all hardware, software, applications, databases, and storage media. B.

STUDENT RIGHTS AND R ESPONSIBILITIES | 627 Users Individuals who make use of Fre donia technology resources. This includes students, faculty and staff, authorized guests, and all persons authorized for access or use privileges by Fredonia including volunteers for local non -profit agencies, scholars visiting from other State University of New York institutions, and the like. C. Policy Statement Users of Fredonia's computing resources must comply with federal and state laws, Fredonia rules and policies, and the terms o f applicable contracts including software licenses while using Fredonia computing resources. Users who engage in electronic communications with persons in other states or countries or on other systems or networks may also be subject to the laws of those jurisdictions and the rules and policies of those other systems and netwo rks. Users with questions as to how the various laws, rules and resolutions may apply to a particular use of Fredonia's computing resources should contact the Chief Information Officer's office for more information. Users are responsible for ascertaining w hat authorizations are necessary and such authorizations prior to using Fredonia computing resources. Users are responsible for any activity originating from their accounts which they can reasonably be expected to control. Accounts and passwords may not, u nder any circumstances, be used by persons other than those to whom they have been assigned by the account administrator. In cases when unauthorized use of accounts or resources is detected or suspected, the account owner should change the password and rep ort the incident. Although there is no set bandwidth, CPU time, or other limit applicable to all uses of Fredonia's computing resources, Fredon ia may require users of those resources to limit or refrain from specific uses if, in the opinion of the system a dministrator, such use interferes with the efficient operations of the system. Users are also expected to refrain from deliberately wasteful practices such as printing unnecessary large documents, performing endless unnecessary computations, or unnecessari ly holding public computers for long periods of time when others are waiting for the same resources. Users must not use computing resources to gain unauthorized access to remote computers or to impair or damage the operations of computers or networks, term inals or peripherals. This includes blocking communication lines, intercepting or sniffing communications, and running, installing or sharing virus programs. Deliberate attempts to circumvent data protection or other security measures are not allowed. Netw ork services and wiring may not be tampered with or extended beyond the area of their intended use. This applies to all network wiring, hardware and in -room jacks. Users shall not use the residential network to provide Internet access to anyone outside of the Fredonia community for any purpose other than those that are in direct support of the academic mission of Fredonia. D. User Accounts Use of Fredonia's computer systems and network requires that a user account be issued by Fredonia. Every computer user account issued by Fredonia is the responsibility of the person in whose name it is issued. Continued use of a previously assigned and previously enabled \"@fredonia.edu\" email account by an inactive or a transferred student is at the discretion of the Chief Information Office. Such accounts, if re -enabled will not be considered \"theft -of-service\". Fredonia recognized clubs and student organizations may be issued a user account. Faculty advisors shall designate a particular person{s) authorized to act on beha lf of the club or organization. This person{s) is responsible for all activity on the account and will be subject to Fredonia's disciplinary procedures for misuse. The following will be considered theft of services, and subject to penalties described below : Using a username without the explicit permission of the owner and of Information Technology Services; Allowing one's username to be used by another person; Using former system and access privileges after association with Fredonia has ended. E. Reso urces 628| STATE UNIVERSITY O F NEW YORK AT FREDON IA 2020 -2021 UNIVERS ITY CATALOG Fredonia's information technology resources are, by nature, finite. All members of the Fredonia community must recognize that certain uses of Fredonia's information technology resources may be limited for reasons related to the capacity or security o f Fredonia's information technology systems, or as required for fulfilling Fredonia's mission. Users shall not use information technology resources to excess. Excessive use of information technology resources by a particular user, or for a particular activ ity, reduces the amount of resource available to satisfy the needs of other users. Excessive use may degrade or jeopardize system functionality, and can result in significant costs to Fredonia. Some examples of excess use may include writing a program or s cript or using an Internet bot to perform a repetitive task such as attempting to register for a class or purchasing concert tickets online. Users shall limit incidental personal use. Incidental personal use is an accepted and appropriate benefit of being associated with Fredonia. Appropriate incidental personal use of technology resources does not result in any measurable cost to Fredonia, and benefits Fredonia by allowing personnel to avoid needless inconvenience. Incidental personal use must adhere to al l applicable Fredonia policies. Under no circumstances may incidental personal use involve violations of the law, interfere with the fulfillment of an employee's professional responsibilities, or adversely im pact or conflict with activities supporting the mission of Fredonia. Examples of incidental personal use may include, sending a personal email or visiting a non -work -related web site. F. Security & Privacy Fredonia employs various measures to protect the security of its computing resources and its user' s accounts. Users should be aware, however, that Fredonia cannot guarantee security and confidentiality. Users should therefore engage in \"safe computing \" practices by establishing appropriate access restrictions for their accounts, guarding their password s and changing them regularly. Users shall not intentionally view information of other users, modify or obtain copies of other users' files, access or attem pt to access other users' email, or modify other users' passwords without their permission. Fredonia computers and networks are designed to protect user personal privacy and as such, users shall not attempt to circumvent these protections. Users shall not develop or use procedures to alter or avoid the accounting and monitoring of th e use of computing fa cilities. For example, users may not utilize facilities anonymously or by means of an alias, and may not send messages, mail, or print files that do not show the correct username of the user performing the operation. Users shall n ot circumvent or attempt t o circumvent security mechanisms or the intent of a system. Computers are Fredonia owned state assets, as such Fredonia retains the inherent right to access these resources either direc tly or indirectly through remote access tools and techniques at any tim e. While Fredonia does not routinely monitor individual usage of its computing resources, the normal operation and maintenance of the Fredonia's computing resources may require the backup and caching of data and communications, the logging of activity, the monitoring of general usage patterns and other such activities that are necessary for the provision of service. Fredonia may also specifically monitor or inspect the activity and accounts of individual users of Fredonia's computing resources, includi ng individual login sessions and the content of individual communications, without notice, when: The user has voluntarily made them accessible to the public, as by posting to a web page; It reasonably appears necessary to do so to protect the integrity, sec urity, or functionality of Fredonia or other computing resources or to protect Fredonia from liability; There is reasonable cause to believe that the user has violated or is violating this policy or any other law or policy; An account appears to be eng aged in unusual or unusually excessive activity; Accessing the account is otherwise required or permitted by law, including but not limited to freedom of information laws, laws governing the conduct of parties engaged in or anticipating litigation, and l aws governing criminal investigations. G. Laws and Fredonia Policies Users must employ technology resources consistent with local, state and federal laws and Fredonia policies. Examples include but are not limited to: Users shall comply with all federal copyright law. Users shall not download, use or distribute illegally obtained media (e.g. software, music, movies). STUDENT RIGHTS AND R ESPONSIBILITIES | 629 Users shall not upload, download, distribute or possess pornography unless written approval has been granted by the Vice President of Ac ademic Affairs / Provost office to accommodate academic research. Research of this nature shall be conducted in an isolated environment approved by the Associate Vice President of Information Technology/Chief Information Officer. H. Commercial Use Computin g resources are not to be used for personal commercial purposes or for personal financial or other gain. Occasional personal use of Fredonia's computing resources for other purposes is permitted when it does not consume a significant amount of those resour ces, does not interfere with the performance of the user's job or other Fredonia assigned responsibilities, and is otherwise in compliance with this policy. Further limits may be imposed upon personal use in accordance with normal supervisory procedures co ncerning the use of Fredonia's equipment. I. Enforcement Users who violate this policy may be denied access to Fredonia's computing resources and may be subject to other penalties and disciplinary action, including possible expulsion or dismissal. Alleged violations will be handled through Fredonia's disciplinary procedures consistent with the terms and conditions of the governing labor agreements (if applicable). Fredonia may suspend, block or restrict access to an account, independent of such procedures, when it reasonably appears necessary to do so in order to protect the integrity, security, or functionality of Fredonia's or other computing resources o r to protect Fredonia from liability. Fredonia may also refer suspected violations of applicable law to appropriate law enforcement agencies. When Information Technology Services becomes aware of a possible violation, Information Technology Services will initiate an investigation in conjunction with relevant campus offices including the President's Cabinet m embers, Human Resources, and University Police in accordance with collective bargaining rights for applicable unions. Users are expected to cooperate full y in such investigations when requested. In order to prevent further unauthorized activity during the course of such an investigation, Information Technology Services may suspend authorization for use of all computing facilities for the user(s) involved in the violation.

Bias Crimes Prevention Bias Crimes Prevention (see website for entire policy and procedures ) The State University of New York at Fredonia Police shall protect all members of the Fredonia community by preventing and prosecuting bias or hate crimes that occur within the campus's jurisdiction. 632| STATE UNIVERSITY O F NEW YORK AT FREDON IA 2020 -2021 UNIVERS ITY CATALOG Hate crimes, also called bias crimes or bias -related crimes, are criminal act ivity motivated by the perpetrator's bias or attitude against an individual victim or group based on perceived or actual personal characteristics, such as their age, religion, eth nicity, gender, sexual orientation, or disability. Penalties for bias -related crimes are very serious and range from fines to imprisonment for lengthy periods, depending on the nature of the underlying criminal offense, the use of violence or previous convictions of the offender. Perpetrators who are students will also be subject t o campus disciplinary procedures where sanctions including expulsion/dismissal are possible. In addition to preventing and prosecuting hate/bias crimes, University Police also assist in addressing bias -related activities that do not rise to the level of a crime. These activities, referred to as bias incidents and defined by the University as objectively perceptible acts of bigotry, harassment, or intimidation directed at a member or group within the Fredonia community based on national origin, ethnicity, ra ce, age, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, veteran status, color, creed, or marital status, may be addressed through the State University's Discrimination Complaint Procedure or the campus Code of Conduct. Bias incidents can be reported to University Police, the Office of Enrollment & Student Services, or the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Students are encouraged to contact the Chief Diversity Officer to request consultation and counseling regarding a crime or incident, to repor t a crime or incident, to file a Charge of Discrimination form, or to share concerns about issues regarding the University. Other offices students may wish to contact are: Enrollment & Student Services, the Intercultural Center, Universi ty Police, the Coun seling Center, Residence Life, and Student Conduct. If you are a victim of, or witness to, a hate/bias crime on campus, report it to University Police by calling (716) 673 -3333 in an emergency, using a Blue Light or other campus emergency telephones, or st opping by the University Police Office located on the 2nd floor in Gregory Hall.

Complaints A complaint of miscond uct is usually written by a complainant and includes specific allegations or charges of misconduct. The complaint will be discussed with the complainant and the accused during separate interviews. If there appears to be grounds f or disciplinary action, it will be addressed through the appropriate procedures. If the complaint is found to be unwarranted or if there is not enough evidence to proceed, the complainant will be so advised. The complaint, relevant evidence and related charges are shared with the ac cused so that the accused can prepare a defense in the event of a conduct hearing. Faculty, staff, students and community members are encouraged to report incidents of misconduct. Police reports and residence hall incident reports are also used to report v iolations of University conduct standards. STUDENT RIGHTS AND R ESPONSIBILITIES | 633 Zero Tolerance Policy As part of a Zero Tolerance Policy, Fredonia will take disciplinary action for every alcohol and drug related violation on campus. Fredonia will also take discip linary action for violations reported off -campus, provided these violations have a connection to the campus. This would include violations that endanger students or may cause harm to the campus community. Parental Notification Policy In October 1998, Congress passed the Higher Education Amendment which permits post -secondary institutions to disclose to parents or legal guardians of students under 21, without their consent, information regarding the student's violation of any federal, state, or local law, or any rule or policy of the institution governing the use or possession of alcohol or a contro lled substance. The Office of Student Conduct normally informs parents or legal guardians of any alcohol or drug violation involving students under 21. Universal Judicial System The University Standards of Behavior and University Policies are intended to promote student development and ensure an atmosphere of learning necessary to the well being of all university community members on and off campus. Violation of University policy off campus may be subject to disciplinary action by the University judicial process. The Office of Enrollme nt and Student Services implements the standards and procedures of the Judicial Board. Any member of the University community may bring a complaint (see Complaints section above) directly to the Office of Student Conduct. The complaint must be written and signed and dated. A review by the Office of Enrollment and Stud ent Services will be initiated and if appropriate charges will be filed. Specific procedures will be followed if a case is referr ed to the Judicial Board. If a student is charged with a violation of the rules and regulations, the following options exist: a student may choose an administrative hearing, a University judicial board hearing, or an administrative sanction hearing in which a student chooses to plead responsible to the charges and waives the right to a hearing. In such a case, the Office of Enroll ment and Student Services will impose a sanction. If a student, club, or organization fails to respond to the letter of charge(s) by the deadline by either pleading responsibl e or not responsible, Fredonia will assume a plea of not responsible. The case wi ll be sent to an Administrative Hearing and the student, club, or organization will be notified of the hearing date and time at least one week in advance of the hearing. A hold will be placed on the student's record pending the outcome of the hearing. A st udent hold restricts a student from registering for classes, dropping or adding classes, and obtaining an official transcript. The club or organization in question will have all privileges suspended pending the outcome of the hearing. Administration Sancti on Hearing In an administrative sanction hearing, the Director of Student Conduct meets with the accused student to hear the case. This option is usually chosen if a student pleads responsible to the charges and acce pts the appropriate sanction. This option requires that the student waive their right to another hearing and to the right to appeal. Administrative Hearing The Administrative Hearing body consists of three University faculty/ staff. The administrative hearing board hears the case, weighs the evidence and testimony of witnesses, determines responsibility or non -responsibility of the accused, and makes a sanction recommendation. The accused student will be determined responsible or non -responsible by the preponderance of the evidence. Preponderance of evidence means evidence that would lead a reasonable person to conclude that it is more likely tha n not that the act in question did occur or that the fact or proposition is true. Judicial Board Hearing The University Judicial Board is comprised of a pool of at least 12 members. Approximately six students and six faculty/staff members are appointed for a term of one year. Members are appointed by the Uni versity President. From the pool of members, the Judicial Board that would hear a case is typically comprised of at least five members. The Judicial Board hears the case, weighs the evidence and testimony of witnesses, determines responsibility or non -responsibility of the accused and makes a sanction recommendation. The accused student will be determined responsible or not responsible by the preponderance of the evidence. Preponderance of evidence means evidence that would lead a reasonable person to concl ude that it is more likely than not that the act in question did occur and/or that the accusations are true. To proceed with a hearing, a minimum of five Jud icial 634| STATE UNIVERSITY O F NEW YORK AT FREDON IA 2020 -2021 UNIVERS ITY CATALOG Board members must be present. If less than five Judicial Board members are present, the accu sed student must agree in writing in order to proceed with the hearing. Procedures for the University Judicial Board Step 1 : A charge for a violation may be placed against any student by any other studen t or by a member of the University community by giving written notice of the charge signed by the complainant to the Office of Student Conduct. Step 2 : The Office of Student Conduct shall give notice of the specific charge(s) against the student, in writin g. The notice shall clearly indicate the offense with specific reference to the violated regulation and shall indicate the time and place of the initial meeting with the Director of Student Conduct. If the student/organization requests a hearing, a separat e notice shall be presented to the accused at least five (5) days prior to the hearing. In extreme cases, the five -day notification period may be waived if deemed necessary. A student may waive their right to a hearing in writing. In such cases, the Direct or of Student Conduct will consider the evidence and make a sanction decision (See Administrative Sanction Hearing (p. 633)). If the student does not waive their right to a hearing and does not appear for su ch a hearing, their case will be considered by the hearing body and a decision will be rendered in their absence. Step 3 : The Office of Student Conduct shall ensure that any student charged with violating University rules or regulations has, prior to appea ring before the Judicial Board, been presented with a statement defining the composition and authority of the Judicial Board. Step 4 : The Judicial Board shall examine all relevant facts and circumstances presented at the hearing. A record of the hearing shall be kept to enable review and every reasonable attempt shall be made to keep the matter appropriately confidential. All hearings are tape recorded, however in the event of equipment failure a board member(s) will take notes to ensure accurate recording of the hearing. Fredonia will not be responsible for turning tape recorded records into written transcript form. Grounds for appeal will also not be considered due to equipment failure. Step 5 : At the hearing, the student shall have a full opportunity to e xplain the circumstances surrounding the incident and shall be able to present pertinent evidence and testimony of witnesses. In addition, the student shall have the opportunity to ask questions of any witnesses, respond to written statements submitted aga inst them and to respond to questions. The Judicial Board shall also have the right to call witnesses and to review materials. The student shall have the right to be assisted by an advisor and or attorney of their choice. The advisor or attorney may not pa rticipate in the hearing. Step 6 : The student's judicial history will be withheld from the board members until a finding of responsibility has been made. If a student is found responsible for violating University policy, judicial history will be shared wit h the board members prior to sanction deliberation. Step 7 : The student shall be notified in writing of the Judicial Board's final decision approximately 3 -5 days following the hearing. The student shall have the right to appeal. An appeal will be consider ed if there is significant new information or material relevant to the case that was not presented during the hearing, or for a claimed violation of the student's due proc ess rights. An appeal must be filed in writing within five (5) days of the hearing de cision letter date. Policies of the Judicial Board 1. The Judicial Board shall not discuss or review matters under consideration outside of the hearing. Failure of a Judicial Board member to uphold this provision rend ers such member subject to impeachment procedures by the Student Affairs Committee. Impeachment shall be by a two -thirds vote of that committee. Any violation of this section shall not affect the proceedings of the Judicial Board in a determination of the case. 2. No member of the Judicial Board shall be either a witness before the board or a person previously engaged in formulating the charge or in presenting materials relating to the case. 3. Judicial Board records shall be filed with the Office of Studen t Conduct and released only with the permission of the Judicial Board, the Director of Student Conduct or the alleged violator. Records shall be kept for seven years. 4. The Judicial Board may adopt bylaws not inconsistent with these rules and regulation u pon the affirmative vote of not less than five members. 5. The Judicial Board pool shall be composed of at least twelve members. Approximately six students and six faculty/staff members are appointed for term of one year. Members are appointed by the Unive rsity President. STUDENT RIGHTS AND R ESPONSIBILITIES | 635 6. In order to be eligible, a student must have attained sophomore status. All members of the Judicial Board must have been a member of the University community for at least one semester before taking office. No student may serve if they a re on disciplinary probation at the time of the appointment. No member of the Judicial Board may be an executive (including class presidents) of the Student Association or a voting member of the University Senate. Consensual Relationships (Faculty/Staff an d Students) MODEL SUNY Consensual Relationship Policy I. Policy Statement: The State University of New York is committed to ensuring that our students, faculty, and staff can learn and work in an environment that is free from nepotism, harassment, exploitation, and conflicts of interest. SUNY is also committed to promoting fairness in grading, evaluation, and career opportunities. In order to achieve this, it is vital that all college personnel maintain professional boundaries with students, and with employees over whom there is or will be a supervisory relationship. SUNY professional staff and other college personnel exercise power and authority over SUNY students and employees for whom they ha ve current supervisory, instructional, or other professional responsibility, which creates a power imbalance. This makes consent within any romantic relationship between a supervisor and employee or between a professional staff or other college personnel a nd a student problematic and may impede the real or perceived freedom of the student or employee to terminate or alter the relationship. Further, it may cause individuals outside of that relationship to believe that they are treated in an unequal manner du ring such a relationship or after it terminates, or it may cause individuals to feel that entering such a relationship is necessary or assistive in attaining their academic or career goals. Such a relationship may damage the credib ility or reputation of th e student, employee, the department or unit, the campus and University as a whole and may expose individuals or the institution to legal action and liability. In the academic context, romantic relationships that might be appropriate in other circumstances have inherent dangers when they occur between professional staff or other college personnel and students. Implicit in the idea of professionalism is the recognition by those in positions of authority that in their relationships with students and employees there is an element of power. Because inherent power differentials exist, professional staff or other college personnel are prohibited from entering romant ic relationships with students for whom such staff or personnel have current supervisory, instruction al or other professional responsibility. Consensual romantic relationships between professional staff or other college personnel and any students for whom such staff or personnel have no current supervisory, instructional or other professional responsibili ty are strongly discouraged. It is understood that any intimate activity between SUNY professional staff/other college personnel and another employee or a student/graduate student shall never take place while the SUNY professional staff/other college perso nnel is on duty or on campus. In regard to SUNY Police, such relations shall also never occur while the officer is in uniform. In the case of pre -existing relationships, professional staff or other college personnel shall be required to recuse themselves from any evaluation of the student and from any activity or decision which may appear to reward, penalize, or otherwise affect the student or student employee and to otherwise take appropriate action to minimize any potential preferential or adverse consequ ences to the student or other members of the College community. In the employment context, there is a presumption against romantic relationships between employees where there is a current supervisory or authority imbalance. In cases where there is or has b een a consensual romantic relationship between two individuals employed by the college, it is important that any sphere of influence or authority by one such employee over another be removed. Where one person is in the direct line of supervision over the o ther, the supervisor must notify college administration so that alternative arrangements for supervision can be made. Where neither individual is in the direct line of supervision over the other, but authority exists wherein one individual cou ld impact any employment related decision regarding the other, such as participating in decisions regarding hiring, termination, appointment, reappointment, promotion, assignment of duties, evaluation or changes in compensation or benefits for the other individual, suc h person must either recuse themselves from the decision -making process or, in the alternative, notify college administration so that they can be removed from the decision -making process. Non-consensual relationships are always prohibited and may implicate other policies or laws. II.

Professional staff or other college personnel who enter a romantic relationship with any employee for whom they provide direct line supervision must notify their direct supervisor or department/unit head, and Director of Human Resour ces or Employee Relations or designee. The employee's supervisor or department/unit head, in concert with the Director of Human Resources or Employee Relations or designee, shall determine whether an alternative supervisory structure is possible and, if so , shall direct the employees to the alternative supervisory structure. The conclusion of the relationship (whether amicably or not), does not change the prohibition stated herein. There is no prohibition or reporting requirement for SUNY professional staff or other college personnel who enter, are currently engaged in, or in the past have been engaged in romantic relationships with other faculty and staff where there is no direct line supervisory relationship. However, where a romantic relationship exists o r has existed, professional staff or other college personnel shall recuse themselves from any personnel decisions regarding the other individual including hiring, termination, appointment, reappointment, promotion, assignment of duties, evaluation or chang es in compensation or benefits for the other individual or, in the alternative, notify college administration so that they can removed from the decision -making process.

All documentation under this policy shall be maintained in the Office of Human Resources or Employee Relations. Retaliation for making a report or participating in a process under this policy is prohibited. The University prohibits an individual from k nowingly filing a false complaint or making misrepresentations of sexual misconduct. A complaint made in good faith is not considered false merely because the evidence does not ultimately support the allegation of sexual misconduc t. If an investigation res ults in a finding that a person who has accused another of sexual misconduct has acted maliciously or has recklessly made false accusations, the reporting party will be subject to appropriate sanctions. It is important to note that due process consideratio ns may limit the ability to investigate or resolve anonymous complaints. VI.

This policy applies to all members of a student organization including alumni members. No organization may engage in any form of hazing. A student found responsible for hazing may receive a permanent transcript notation on his or her transcript. This is more particul arly described in the Permanent Transcript Notation Policy . Hazing is defined as engaging in any action or creating a situation intentionally or unintentionally designed to produce ment al or physical discomfort, harassment, fatigue, intoxication or excessi ve ridicule in the course of another person's initiation into or affiliation with any organization.

Revocation of recognition may not preclude the imposition of the University Judicial Board; but when considered by the Vice President for Student Affairs to be serious in nat ure, could result in immediate suspension of organizational recognition until such time as the allegations have been appropriately adjudicated. Students are prohibited from pledging, joining, or accepting membership with a fraternity, sorority, or student organization which has been dismissed or expelled. Given the University's concern regarding the physical and/or mental health risk that expelled student organizations pose, individual students who join expelled student organizations can be charged with thi s regulation and receive a sanction that would expel/dismiss them from the University.

Where there is reasonable cause to believe that the University regulations prohibiting sexual assault have been violated, the campus will pursue strong disciplinary action through its own channels. This discipline includ es the possibility of suspension or expulsion/dismissal from the University. A student charged with an act of sexual violence can be prosecuted under New York State criminal statutes and disciplined under the campus code of student conduct. Even if the cri minal justice authorities choose not to prosecute, the campus can pursue disciplinary action. A student may be charged under Section 2(f) of the Standards of Behavior. In addressing cases of sexual assault, the State University of New York at Fredonia work s to ensure fairness and to provide support for all persons involved. Students who have questions about the procedures and protections provided in these cases ar e encouraged to contact the Office of Enrollment and Student Services and/or University Police. Students are also encouraged to take advantage of the Student Counseling Center and Student Health Center for further assistance. Definition of Consent Fredonia recognizes the following definition of consent: Affirmative consent is a clear, unambiguous, k nowing, informed, and voluntary agreement between all participants to engage in sexual activity. Consent is active, not passive. Silence or lack of resistance cannot be interpreted as consent. Seeking and having consent accepted is the responsibility of th e person(s) initiating each specific sexual act regardless of whether the person initiating the act is under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol. Consent to any sexual act or prior consensual sexual activity between or with any party does not constitute consent to any other sexual act. The definition of consent does not vary based upon a participant's sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or ge nder expression. Consent may be initially given but withdrawn at any time. When consent is withdrawn or cannot be given, sexual activity must stop. Consent cannot be given when a person is incapacitated. Incapacitation occurs when an individual lacks th e ability to fully, knowingly choose to participate in sexual activity. Incapacitation includes impairment due to drugs or alcohol (whether such use is voluntary or involuntary), the lack of consciousness or being asleep, being involuntarily restrained, if any of the parties are under the age of 17, or if an individual otherwise cannot consent. Consent cannot be give n when it is the result of any coercion, intimidation, force, or threat of harm. Policy for Alcohol and/or Drug Use Amnesty in Sexual Violence Cases The health and safety of every student at the State University of New York and its State -operated and commu nity colleges is of utmost importance. Fredonia recognizes that students who have been drinking and/or using drugs (whether such use is voluntary or involuntary) at the time a sexual violence incident occurs may be hesitant to report such incidents due to fear of potential consequences for their own conduct. Fredonia strongly encourages students to report incidents of sexual violence to campus officials. A bystander reporting in good faith or a victim/survivor reporting sexual violence to Fredonia officials or law enforcement will not be subject to campus conduct action for violations of alcohol and/or drug use policies occurring at or n ear the time of the sexual violence. Campus Climate Assessment Policy Climate assessments afford institutions the opportuni ty to better understand their campus and to make informed decisions when it comes to providing a safe educational environment. Beginning in the 2015 -2016 academic year, each State University of New York State -operated and community college will conduct a u niform climate survey that analyzes prevalence and attitudes regarding sexual harassment, including sexual violence, and other related crimes. The survey will address at least the follow ing: Student and employee knowledge about: The Title IX Coordinato r's role; Campus policies and procedures addressing sexual assault; How and where to report sexual violence as a victim/survivor or witness; STUDENT RIGHTS AND R ESPONSIBILITIES | 643 The availability of resources on and off -campus, such as counseling, health, academic assistance; The p revalence of victimization and perpetration of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking on and off -campus during a set time period (for example, the last two years); Bystander attitudes and behavior; and Whether victims/surviv ors reported to the University and/or police, and reasons why they did or did not report. Beginning in the spring semester of 2015, the Chancellor or designee convened a group of scholars and practitioners to review methods of assessing campus climate, sp ecific questions asked in past surveys, relevant data on responses and response rates, issues and problems encountered in survey implementation, and lessons learned from past surveys. The Chancellor or designee will gather this data and seek to develop a s tandardized survey, with the advice of relevant members of the SUNY community and knowledgeable outside entities, that uses established measurement tools, to be implemented every two years by all SUNY State -operated and community colleges beginning in the 2015 -2016 academic year. This policy may be changed by the Chancellor or designee should federal and/or State legislation require a different process or duplicate efforts to assess cam pus climate via survey. Sexual Violence Victim/Survivor Bill of Rights The State University of New York and Fredonia are committed to providing options, support and assistance to victims/survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and/or stalking to ensure that they can continue to participate in Universit y-wide and campus programs, activities, and employment.

Options for Confidentially Disclosing Sexual Violence The State University of New York and Fredonia want you to get the information and support you need regardless of whether you would like to move forward with a report of sexual violence to campus officials or to police. You may want to talk with someone about something you observed or experienced, even if you are not sure that the behavior constitut es sexual violence. A conversation where questions can be answered is far superior to keeping something to yourself. Confidentiality varies, and this document is aimed at helping you understand how confidentiality applies to different resources that may be available to you. Privileged and Confidential Resources: Individuals who are confidential resources will not report crimes to law enforcement or University officials without your permission, except for extreme circumstances, such as a health and/or safety emergency. At Fredonia, this includes: Fredonia's Coordinator: LoGrasso Hall, (716) 673 -3424 Off-campus options to disclose sexual violence confidentially include (note that these outside options do not provide any information to the campus): Off-campus counselors and advocates. Crisis services offices will generally maintain confidentiality unless you re quest disclosure and sign a consent or waiver form. More information on an agency's policies on confidentiality may be obtained directly from the agency. Stacey Tanner, Director of Human Services: The Salvation Army Rape Crisis Services P.O.

Options are explained here: http://www.ovs.ny.gov/helpforcrimevictims.html. Note that even individuals who can typically maintain confidentiality are subject to exceptions under the law, including when an ind ividual is a threat to themselves or others and the mandatory reporting of child abuse. Non-Professional Counselors and Advocates : Non-professional counselors and advocates can also assist you without sharing information that could identify you. At Fredoni a, this includes the CEASE program of the Counseling Center, LoGrasso Hall, (716) 673 -3424. The CEASE Coordinator will report the nature, date, time, and general location of an incident to Fredonia's Title IX Coordinator, but w ill consult with you to ensur e no personally identifying details are shared without your consent. These individuals are not considered confidential resources as discussed above. Privacy versus Confidentiality : Even Fredonia offices and employees who cannot guarantee confidentiality wi ll maintain your privacy to the greatest extent possible. The information you provide to a non -confidential resource will be relayed only as necessary to investigate and/or seek a resolution and to notify the Title IX Coordinator or designee, who is respon sible under the law for tracking patterns and spotting systemic issues. Fredonia will limit the disclosure as much as possible, even if the Title IX Coordinator determines that the request for confidentiality cannot be honored. Requesting Confidentiality: How Fredonia Will Weigh the Request and Respond : If you disclose an incident to a Fredonia employee who is responsible for responding to or reporting sexual violence or sexua l harassment, but wish to maintain confidentiality or do not consent to the instit ution's request to initiate an investigation, the Title IX Coordinator must weigh your request against our obligation to provide a safe, non -discriminatory environment for all members of our community, including you. We will assist you with academic, housi ng, transportation, employment, and other reasonable and available accommodations regardless of your reporting choices. While victims/survivors may request accommodations through several University offices, the following office can serve as a primary point of contact to assist with these measures: The Office of Enrollment and Student Services, 6th floor of Maytum Hall (716) 673 -3271. We also may take proactive steps, such as training or awareness efforts, to combat sexual violence in a general way that does not identify you or the situation you disclosed. We may seek consent from you prior to conducting an investigation. You may decline to consent to an investigation, and that determination will be honored unless the Fredonia's failure to act may result in h arm to you or other members of the Fredonia community. Honoring your request may limit our ability to meaningfully investigate and pursue conduct action against an accused individual. If we determine that an investigation is required, we will notify you an d take immediate action as necessary to protect and assist you. When you disclose an incident to someone who is responsible for responding to or reporting sexual violence or sexual harassment, but wish to maintain confidentiality, Fredonia will consider ma ny factors to determine whether to proceed despite that request. These factors include, but are not limited to: Whether the accused has a history of violent behavior or is a repeat offender; Whether the incident represents escalation, such as a situat ion that previously involved sustained stalking, the increased risk that the accused will commit additional acts of violence; Whether the accused used a weapon or force; Whether the victim/survivor is a minor; and Whether we possess other means to obtain evidence such as security footage, and whether the report reveals a pattern of perpetration at a given location or by a particular group. Public Awareness/Advocacy Events : If you disclose a situation through a public awareness event such as \"Take Back the Night,\" candlelight vigils, protests, or other public event, the University is not obligated to begin an investigation. Fredonia may use the information you provide to info rm the need for additional education and prevention efforts. Anonymous Disc losure : Incidents can be reported anonymously to University Police through the Silent Witness online form: http://students.fredonia.edu/upd/updsilent.

Fredonia's Title IX Coordinator can be reached at (716) 673 -3358. Fredonia is obligated to issue timely warnings of Clery Act crimes occurring within relevant geography that represent a serio us or continuing threat to students and employees (subject to exc eptions when potentially compromising law enforcement efforts and when the warning itself could potentially identify the victim/survivor). A victim/survivor will never be identified in a timely warning. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act allows institutions to share information with parents when (1) there is a health or safety emergency, or (2) when the student is a dependent on either parents' prior year federal income tax return. Generall y, Fredonia will not share information about a report of sexual violence with parents without the permission of the victim/survivor. Sexual Discrimination and Sexual Harassment Sexual Harassment Policy SUNY Sexual Harassment R esponse and Prevention Policy Statement Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination which is unlawful in the workplace under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, and the New York State Human Rights Law. Under Title IX of the Educat ional Amendments of 1972, sexual harassment also is prohibited in the provision of educational services and protects students and employees from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is prohibited and will not be tolerated at SUNY. The University has impl emented measures to address and prevent sexual harassment and is taking additional affirmative steps to increase awareness of, and sensitivity to, all forms of sexual harassment in order to maintain a workplace and learning environment free of its harmful effects. Sexual harassment is a form of workplace discrimination and employee misconduct, as well as a form of discrimination in the academic setting, and all employees and students are entitled to work and learn in a campus environment that prevents sexual harassment. All employees and students have a legal right to a workplace and a campus free from sexual harassment, and employees and students can enforce this right by filing a complaint internally with the University, or with a government agency, o r in court under federal or state anti -discrimination laws, as detailed in the University's Discrimination and Sexual Harassment Complaint Procedure. In accordance with applicable law, sexual harassment is generally described as unwelcome sexual advances , requests for sexual favors or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when: Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of employment or academic benefit; or Submission to or rejection of the c onduct is used as the basis for an employment or academic decision affecting the person rejecting or submitting to the conduct; or The conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an affected person's work or academic performance, or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work or learning environment. Sexual harassment can include physical touching, verbal comments, non -verbal conduct such as leering or inappropriate written or electronic communications, or a combination of t hese things. Examples of sexual harassment may include, but are not limited to: Seeking sexual favors or a sexual relationship in return for the promise of a favorable grade or academic opportunity; 650| STATE UNIVERSITY O F NEW YORK AT FREDON IA 2020 -2021 UNIVERS ITY CATALOG Conditioning an employment -related action (such as h iring, promotion, salary increase, or performance appraisal) on a sexual favor or relationship; or Intentional and undesired physical contact, sexually explicit language or writing, lewd pictures or notes, and other forms of sexually offensive conduct by i ndividuals in positions of authority, co -workers or student peers, that unreasonably interferes with the ability of a person to perform their employment or academic responsibilities.

Unwanted sexual advances or propositions, such as: Requests for sexual favors accompanied by i mplied or overt threats concerning a target's job performance evaluation, a promotion or other job benefits or detriments, or an educational benefit or detriment; Subtle or obvious pressure for unwelcome sexual activities. Sexually oriented gestures, n oises, remarks, jokes or comments about a person's sexuality or sexual experience, which create a hostile environment. Sex stereotyping occurs when conduct or personality traits are considered inappropriate simply because they may not conform to other p eople's ideas or perceptions about how individuals of a particular sex should act or look. Sexual or discriminatory displays or publications, such as: Displaying pictures, posters, calendars, graffiti, objects, promotional material, reading materials o r other materials that are sexually demeaning or pornographic. This includes such sexual displays on computers or cell phones and sharing such displays while in the workplace or classroom. Hostile actions taken against an individual because of that indiv idual's sex, sexual orientation, self -identified or perceived sex, gender expression, gender identity, and the status of being transgender, such as: Interfering with, destroying or damaging a person's workstation, tools or equipment, or otherwise interf ering with the individual's ability to perform his or her employment or academic duties; Sabotaging an individual's work; Bullying, yelling, name -calling. Such behavior can constitute sexual harassment regardless of the sex, gender, sexual orientation , self -identified or perceived sex, gender expression, status of being transgender, or gender identity of any of the persons involved. Sexual harassment is considered a form of employee and student misconduct which may lead to disciplinary action. Further, supervisors and managers will be subject to discipline for failing to report suspected sexual harassment or otherwise knowingly allowing sexu al harassment to continue. Employees and students who believe they have been subjected to sexual harassment may us e the University's Discrimination and Sexual Harassment Complaint Procedure for more details on how to have their allegations reviewed, including a link to a complaint form. Retaliation against a person who files a complaint, serves as a witness, or as sists or participates in any manner in this procedure, is unlawful, is strictly prohibited and may result in disciplinary action. Retaliation is an adverse action taken against an individual as a result of complaining about or provides information regardi ng unlawful discrimination or harassment, exercising a legal right, and/or participating in a complaint investigation as a third -party witness. Adverse action includes being discharged, disciplined, discriminated against, or otherwise subject to adverse ac tion because the individual reports an incident of sexual harassment, provides information, or otherwise assists in any investigation of a sexual harassment complaint. Participants who experience retaliation should contact the campus AAO, and may file a co mplaint pursuant to these procedures. SUNY campuses and System Administration shall take the necessary steps to ensure that this Sexual Harassment Response and Prevention Policy Statement is distributed, implemented, and enforced in accordance with their respective policies. Reporting and Addressing Complaints: STUDENT RIGHTS AND R ESPONSIBILITIES | 651 Sexual discrimination, including sexual harassment should be promptly reported to the Title IX Coordinator at the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, 143 Fenton Hall, (716) 673 -3358. Any suc h information provided shall, to the extent possible, be handled in a manner to maintain the privacy of the reporting party(ies). Fredonia students and employees can choose to participate in a SUNY -wide grievance procedure to initiate investigation and pot ential resolution of a complaint. Detailed information regarding the process, including the complaint form is available on the discrimination complaint procedure website. Use of the internal grievance procedure does not deprive a complainant of the right t o file with outside enforcement agencies, such as the New York State Division of Human Rights, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Office for Civil Rights of the United State Department of Education, and/or the Office of Federal Contract Compl iance of the United States Department of Labor. Harassment shall be found where, in aggregate, the incidents are sufficiently pervasive, or persistent, or severe that a reas onable person, of similar background would be adversely affected to a degree that i nterferes with their ability to participate in or to realize the intended benefits of an institutional activity, employment, or resource. Should disciplinary action be implemente d, or campus judiciary proceedings invoked, it shall be done consistent with t he terms and conditions of the governing collective bargaining agreement or campus judicial policy. An employee or student who participates in the discrimination complaint process, or reports an incident of discrimination due to harassment, has the right t o do so without fear of retaliation. If retaliation were to occur, appropriate sanctions or disciplinary action consistent with the terms and conditions of the governing collective bargaining agreement or campus judicial policy sh all be followed.
