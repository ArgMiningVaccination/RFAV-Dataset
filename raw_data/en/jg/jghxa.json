Find out how garlic helps your hair grow, peppers fight wrinkles, and green tea saves you from sun damage. Solve Your Skin Problems With Food Spices may play an essential role in your favorite recipes (or maybe they just make you think of a [certain favorite girl group](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJLIiF15wjQ)), but these natural wonders can also be secret ingredients in your skin care regimen. Many spices contain high levels of antioxidants, anti-inflammatory agents, and nutrients your skin and hair need to look healthy. Read on to learn how herbs and spices can fight wrinkles, soothe redness, and keep your skin glowing. Chamomile to Calm Beard Burn Few of us can resist a man with sexy five o'clock shadow, but a steamy make-out session can leave you with beard burn \u2014 patches of redness, flaking, itching, and general irritation around the mouth, chin, and cheeks that resemble sunburn. Fortunately, nature's most soothing herbal leaf can heal distressed skin quickly. \"Chamomile is a natural anti-inflammatory, with the power to reduce redness, itchiness, and swelling, and it's a great alternative to [cortisone](/drugs/cortisone),\" says Jessica Wu, MD, a clinical associate professor of dermatology at the University of Southern California medical school. To treat beard burn, steep a chamomile tea bag in boiling water for two to three minutes to release the anti-inflammatory enzymes, then place the tea bag in a small container in your fridge. Once the tea bag is cold, apply it directly to red, irritated patches on your face for instant relief. Cinnamon for a Glowing Complexion Cinnamon adds a kick to cookies and hot drinks, but it's also packed with antioxidants \u2014 substances that fight skin damage. \"Cinnamon has more antioxidant value than half a cup of [blueberries](/diet-nutrition/diet/blueberries-nutrition-health-benefits-recipes-more/),\" says nutritionist Keri Glassman, the author of The O2 Diet. For an easy antioxidant boost, sprinkle half a teaspoon of cinnamon on your coffee grounds before brewing. To ensure you're using the most potent spices, says Glassman, discard bottles that are more than two years old; also, store spices in a dark cupboard, because heat from the stove and sunlight will decrease their potency. Garlic for Healthy Hair While [garlic](/drugs/garlic) may be killer for your breath, it's a lifesaver for [thin hair](//www.everydayhealth.com/hair-loss-pictures/ways-to-grow-healthy-hair-0209.aspx). Your hair follicle needs nutrients to produce thick, healthy hair. When you aren't eating the right ones, your hair pays the price. Foods that are high in cysteine, an [amino acid](/amino-acids/guide/) found in garlic, can help reinvigorate your follicles, says Dr. Wu. \"Cysteine molecules are linked together in a strong sequence of disulfide bonds,\" she explains, \"which gives your hair its strength.\" Green Tea for Sun Protection Here's one more reason to go green: [Green tea](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/diet/green-tea-nutrition-health-benefits-side-effects/) has a high concentration of catechins, which have strong anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-aging effects on skin. Says Wu, \"Topical green tea can also help thicken the epidermis, speed the healing of wounds, and inhibit an enzyme in your skin that causes uneven pigmentation, which means fewer sun spots.\" Studies have shown that using a lotion or serum containing green tea 30 minutes before going out in the sun can reduce DNA damage and the risk of sunburn. \"If you're going to be outside for several hours and won't be able to reapply sunscreen as diligently as you'd like,\" says Wu, \"then applying green tea on top of your sunscreen before you go out is a great idea.\" Hot Peppers to Fight Wrinkles Hot peppers like chili, paprika, cayenne, and jalape\u00f1o do more than put your taste buds on alert \u2014 they also defend your skin. \"Vitamins A and C in peppers help combat free radicals, preventing the breakdown of collagen to maintain the integrity of our skin,\" says Marti Wolfson, the culinary director at Blum Center for Health in Rye Brook, N.Y. The colorful peppers also contain [capsaicin](/drugs/capsaicin-topical), which acts like a sunscreen to shield skin from damage caused by UV rays. You have to ingest peppers to enjoy their regenerative powers, though, as the capsaicin that works wonders for skin internally will burn if applied topically. Says Wolfson, \"Hot peppers are so easy to add to any dish: Try jalape\u00f1o or cayenne in guacamole, and chili peppers in curry sauce. You can also make a rub for fish or chicken with paprika.\" Red Clover to Ease Eczema Medicinal herbalists have long used red clover to help soothe the red, scaly, and maddeningly itchy patches of skin that plague [eczema](/eczema/guide/) sufferers. \"Herbs like red clover help eliminate toxins in the bloodstream that appear to trigger inflammation,\" says Liz Earle, a holistic skin expert who herself suffers from eczema. According to the University of Maryland Medical Center's health reference library, red clover can be ingested as a tea or applied topically. If you're going to drink the tea, steep one to two teaspoons of dried flowers in hot water for half an hour, and sip two to three cups daily to reap the benefits. If you want to take red clover as a supplement, 40 to 160 mg per day is recommended. Ointments are also available that contain 10 to 15 percent red clover flower. Turmeric to Reduce Inflammation [Turmeric](/drugs/turmeric) has been used in India for thousands of years; the herb has powerful anti-inflammatory benefits because of its high concentration of the antioxidant curcumin. Research has shown that curcumin may also help fight [melanoma](/melanoma/) when the affected skin is treated topically with turmeric. \"Curcumin inhibits angiogenesis, which is the growth of blood vessels,\" explains Susan Blum, MD, an integrative medical practitioner at Blum Center for Health. \"A lot of [cancer research](/cancer/guide/) is focused on 'starving' the cancer cells, and curcumin appears to be a potent inhibitor of tumor activity in animal studies.\" Add turmeric to deviled eggs, pasta, and potato salads, as well as hearty savory soups, chili, and brown rice. Mixed with ginger, it also makes a tasty tea. "}
