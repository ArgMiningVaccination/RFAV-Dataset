JYNNEOS is the preferred vaccine for the current outbreak of mpox. Vaccine supply for JYNNEOS is increasing in the United States but may be limited in some areas. In Wisconsin, JYNNEOS is currently available for the following people: - Known close contacts who are identified by public health, and - People with certain risk factors who are more likely to have been recently exposed to mpox, even if they have not had documented exposure to someone with confirmed mpox. JYNNEOS Who can get the JYNNEOS vaccine? The Department of Health Services (DHS) is currently following the CDC's recommendation to prioritize the JYNNEOS vaccine for people at the highest risk of infection. JYNNEOS vaccine is currently available in Wisconsin for the following people: - Known contacts who are identified by public health through case investigation, contact tracing, and risk exposure assessments - Presumed contacts who may meet the following criteria: - People who know that a sexual partner in the past 14 days was diagnosed with mpox. - People considered to have elevated risk of exposure to mpox in the future: - Gay men, bisexual men, trans men and women, any men who have sex with men, and gender non-conforming/non-binary individuals who: - Have recently had multiple or anonymous sex partners. This may include people living with HIV and people who take HIV pre-exposure because of increased risk of sexually transmitted infections. - Have new diagnosis of one or more nationally reportable sexually transmitted diseases (for example, acute HIV, chancroid, chlamydia, gonorrhea, or syphilis). - People who attended or had sex at a commercial sex venue or an event or venue where there was known mpox transmission or exposure. - Sexual partners of people with the above risks. - People who anticipate experiencing the above risks. - Gay men, bisexual men, trans men and women, any men who have sex with men, and gender non-conforming/non-binary individuals who: - People in certain occupational exposure risk groups: - Clinical laboratory personnel who perform testing to diagnose orthopoxviruses, including those who use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for diagnosis of orthopoxviruses, including mpox virus. - Research laboratory workers who directly handle cultures or animals contaminated or infected with orthopoxviruses that infect humans, including mpox virus, replication-competent Vaccinia virus, or recombinant Vaccinia viruses derived from replication-competent Vaccinia virus strains. Laboratory staff working with lesion swabs that may contain orthopoxviruses. This includes staff that handle swabs of lesions from suspect mpox cases or test for things other than orthopoxviruses, including Varicella zoster virus or Herpes virus. This also includes microbiologists that do standard bacterial cultures from these lesion swabs. - Certain health care providers working in sexual health clinics or other specialty settings directly caring for patients with sexually transmitted infections. Where can I get vaccinated? If you are eligible for the mpox vaccine, DHS encourages you to [contact your local or tribal health department (LTHD)](/lh-depts/counties.htm). DHS continues to work directly with LTHDs to supply vaccine for people who had a known exposure to someone with mpox and Wisconsinites who meet the eligibility criteria. The JYNNEOS vaccine is also available by appointment at designated health care locations for eligible people. Please see below for a list of vaccinators accepting appointments from the public. If you meet the current eligibility requirements for vaccination and are unable to make an appointment at one of these locations, contact your LTHD for assistance connecting with a vaccinator. |Location||Website/Contact Information| Health Department|| Public Health website](https://www.browncountywi.gov/departments/public-health/general-information/) [Calumet County Public Health](https://www.co.calumet.wi.us/156/Public-Health) County Department of website](https://www.co.chippewa.wi.us/government/public-health/) [City of Appleton Health Department website](https://www.appleton.org/residents/health) [City of Milwaukee Health Department website](https://city.milwaukee.gov/Health/) [City of Racine Public Health Department website](https://www.cityofracine.org/health/) [Columbia County Division of Public Health website](https://www.co.columbia.wi.us/columbiacounty/hhs/HealthHumanService/PublicHealth/tabid/327/Default.aspx) [Cudahy Health Department website](https://www.cudahy-wi.gov/departments/health/index.php) [De Pere Health Department website](https://www.deperewi.gov/department/?structureid=12) Public [Door County [Eau Claire City-County Health website](https://www.eauclairewi.gov/government/our-divisions/health-department) [Fond du Health Department [Froedtert Memorial Hospital website](https://www.froedtert.com/) [Froedtert Memorial Hospital website](https://www.froedtert.com/locations/health-center/pleasant-valley-health-center) [Froedtert Medical College of Wisconsin Inclusion Clinic website](https://www.froedtert.com/locations/clinic/inclusion-health-clinic-sargeant-health-center) [Grant County Health Department website](http://www.co.grant.wi.gov/localgov_departments_details.asp?deptid=414&locid=147) [Green Health website](https://www.gundersenhealth.org/locations/la-crosse-campus/clinic/) [Ho Falls Street Clinic website](http://www.holtonstreetclinic.org/) [Iowa County Health Department Public Health website](https://www.co.jackson.mi.us/276/Health-Department) [Jefferson County Health Department](https://www.jeffersoncountywi.gov/departments/health/index.php) [Kenosha County Division of Health website](https://www.kenoshacounty.org/297/Health-Services) [La Crosse County Health Department](https://www.lacrossecounty.org/health/) [Lafayette County Health Department County Health County Department](https://www.co.monroe.wi.us/departments/health-department) Department website](https://www.nshealthdept.org/) Health Department website](https://publichealth.co.oneida.wi.us/monkeypox/) [Outreach Community Health Center website](https://www.ochc-milw.org/) [Pierce County Public Health [Portage County [Public Health Division](https://crchd.com/) [Richland Department](https://www.co.richland.wi.us/departments/hhs/publichealth/index.shtml) [Rock County Public Health Department website](https://www.co.rock.wi.us/departments/public-health/communicable-disease/monkeypox) [Rusk County Public Health website](https://ruskcounty.org/publichealth) [Sauk County Health Department County Public Health](https://www.sheboygancounty.com/departments/departments-f-q/health-and-human-services/public-health) [Vilas County Health Department website](https://www.vilascountywi.gov/departments/services/public_health_department/index.php) [Vivent Health - Green Bay website](https://viventhealth.org/locations/green-bay/) [Vivent Health - Kenosha website](https://viventhealth.org/locations/kenosha/) [Vivent Health - Madison website](https://viventhealth.org/locations/madison/) [Vivent Health - Milwaukee website](https://viventhealth.org/locations/milwaukee/) [Watertown Department of Public [Washburn County Health Health Department website](https://www.washozwi.gov/) [Wood County Health Department website](https://www.co.wood.wi.us/departments/health/) *DHS will continue to keep this list updated.

Due to an extremely limited vaccine supply, vaccine is being prioritized for those most at risk for severe disease. People who are known contacts of someone with mpox or who have another high-risk exposure remain the highest priority. Vaccine is also being prioritized for people with HIV or other conditions that contribute to a weakened immune system.

Find additional resources online at [211Wisconsin.org.](https://211wisconsin.communityos.org/) How is it administered? The JYNNEOS vaccine is a two-dose vaccine series. The two doses are administered four weeks apart for maximum effectiveness. Someone who receives the JYNNEOS vaccine is considered fully vaccinated two weeks after receiving their second dose. - People 18 years and older can receive JYNNEOS as either an injection between the skin (intradermally) or beneath the skin (subcutaneously). - People under the age of 18 can receive JYNNEOS only as an injection beneath the skin (subcutaneously). The JYNNEOS vaccine does not cause smallpox, mpox, or any other disease. Even after getting vaccinated, it is important to continue to [take steps](/mpox/index.htm) to protect yourself from getting sick with mpox. Avoid close, skin-to-skin contact, including intimate contact, with someone who has mpox. Frequently asked questions Yes. To help prevent the onset of disease, JYNNEOS should be administered within four days from the date of exposure to the mpox virus. If the vaccine is administered between four to 14 days after the date of exposure, getting vaccinated may help reduce the severity of symptoms associated with mpox infection. People should speak with a health care provider to discuss if the JYNNEOS vaccine is safe for them if they have had: - An allergic reaction to a previous dose of JYNNOES, OR - An allergic reaction to an ingredient (gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, egg protein, benzonase). People should also talk to a health care provider about getting vaccinated if they have any of the following conditions: - Severe, life-threatening allergies. - Are pregnant, think they can be pregnant, or breastfeeding. - Have a weakened immune system.

Avoid close, skin-to-skin contact, including intimate contact, with someone who has mpox. Providers cannot charge a patient a fee for the vaccine itself. However, providers may charge the patient an administration fee or seek appropriate reimbursement from the program or plan that covers administration fee for the mpox vaccine, such as private insurance or Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement. Providers must administer JYNNEOS at no cost to the recipient regardless of the vaccine recipient's ability to pay administration fees. It is unknown if pregnant people are more susceptible to mpox infection or more severe disease during pregnancy. However, the mpox virus can be transmitted to the unborn baby and to the newborn through close contact during and after birth. The JYNNEOS vaccine should be offered to people who are pregnant or breastfeeding if they are exposed to mpox. People who are pregnant or breastfeeding are encouraged to talk with a health care provider about the risks and benefits of getting vaccinated. Most people who receive the JYNNEOS vaccine will have only minor reactions like pain, redness, swelling, and itching at the injection site. In rare circumstances, people may experience muscle pain, headache, tiredness, nausea, chills, and fever. Call 911 immediately or go to the nearest hospital if you have signs of an allergic reaction. Signs of an allergic reaction may include: - Hives - Swelling of the face or throat - Difficulty breathing - Increased heartbeat - Dizziness Any adverse reaction after getting vaccinated should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). In most cases, a health care provider will report the incident to VAERS. However, you can choose to report the incident yourself by visiting the [VAERS website](https://vaers.hhs.gov/) or calling 800-822-7967. VAERS staff do not provide medical advice and can only assist with reporting adverse reactions. ACAM2000 ACAM2000 is also authorized by the U.S Food and Drug Administration to prevent mpox infection. DHS will not be using the ACAM2000 vaccine. ACAM2000 carries a greater risk of certain serious side effects than JYNNEOS. ACAM2000 should not be given to: - People with weakened immune systems, - People with certain skin conditions such as eczema, - People heart disease, or - People who are pregnant, think they are pregnant, or breastfeeding.
