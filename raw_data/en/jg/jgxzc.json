Completion (CY): 1997 OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: To identify risk fa ctors associated with reported symptoms in an effort to determine causes for pos sible Gulf War-related morbidity. SPECIFIC AIMS: Are there diffe rences in postwar morbidity bet ween War veterans (GWV) and nondeployed veterans (NDV)? METHODOLOGY: Seabees who were on Active-d uty and had been so since September 1990 were eligible to participate. Seabees (Navy construction workers) were interviewed at two major Seabee bases, in Port Hueneme, CA, and Gulfport, MS. Af ter signing a consent form, volunteers completed a questionnaire, provided blood and urine specimens, and had their height, weight, and hand-grip strength measured. A systematically selected subsample also performed a spirometry test. Whole blood, sera, and urine specimens were stored at -7 0\u00b0C. Sera were studied for evidence of infection while whole blood specimens may be characterized for genetic markers that may explain symptoms. Also, sera collected during this study will be compared to prewar sera, which are known to be available for a majority of the study population. Urine specimens may be used to rule out chronic diseases, such as adrenal insufficiency. Hand gr ip strength and spirometry results were compared among symptomatic and nonsymptomatic Seabees. The questionnaire responses will be used to compare the morbidity of GWV and NDV. Internal comparisons will be made among GWV using logistic regression modeling to determine if any specific exposures are associated with any symptoms or symptom complexes. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): A number of comparisons of morbidity between GWV and NDV Seabees have been performed. A summary manuscript is under journal review. Three supplemental manuscripts are in internal review or nearly ready for internal review: the role of pyridostigmine bromide on handgrip strength, t he role of Mycoplasma fermentans in causing morbidity, and a factor analysis of symptom data. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Seabees (n=1498 ) were surveyed and studied. GWV Seabees self-reported a higher prevalence of exposures and symptoms, as well as higher scores for abnormal psychological variables. Gulf War Veterans we re more likely to screen for post-traumatic stress disorder, had lower handgrip strengths, and higher serum ferritin assays, however, after numerous comparisons of these outcomes with various expo sures, no exposure or group of exposures stood out as likely etiologic.

Completion (CY): 1998 OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Screen Departm ent of Defense (DoD) hospitalizations for association with Gulf War deployment; identify spec ific diseases or disease groups that merit further study. SPECIFIC AIMS: Are hospitalization rates the sa me for Gulf War vetera ns (GWV) and nondeployed veterans (NDV)? EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES) : These data have been proven very useful beyond their original intent in examining new hypothesis r egarding specific Gulf War exposure and specific hospitalization outcomes. One study has been publis hed in a leading journal, two more are in press and numerous abstracts have been presented (see belo w). Several more studies are under external review for publication: STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: In general, Gulf War veterans postwar hospitalization data are very similar to that of their nondeployed peers. Thus far, there has been little evidence on unexplained increased postwar hospitalization morbid ity associated with Gulf War service.

Project #: DoD-1C Agency: DoD Study Location: Naval Health Research Center Project Status: Completed Research Type: Research P.I.: CDR Greg Resear ch Reproductive Health Start Date (CY): 1994 Est. Completion (CY): 1997 OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ri sk of birth defects and other adverse pregnancy outcomes diagnosed in military medical treatment facilities (MTFs). Risk and relative risk of inpatient events will be assessed based on existing data. SPECIFIC AIMS: Within the design parameters, ar e Persian Gulf War veterans (GWV) at higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes than nondeployed veterans (NDV)? METHODOLOGY: This was an historical cohort study of reproductive outcomes among military personnel deployed to the Gulf War compared to military personnel who were not deployed. Demographic and hospitalization data were av ailable for approximately 500,000 GWV and 700,000 NDV from the Department of Defense Manpower Da ta Center. Substantial demographic information was available on all subjects, including race/ethni city, proxy measures of socio-economic status (rank and education), and military occupation. Data on inpatient services received from MTFs were also available and diagnoses were recorded using IC D-9-CM codes. Risk and relative risks of major birth defects were evaluated. Potentially confoundi ng factors such as maternal age were evaluated. Multivariate analysis was conducted to estimate re lative risks, controlling for identified cofounders. Events among female service members were cons idered separately from those among spouses of male service members. In another study we me asured the prevalence of Goldenhar syndrome among infants born in military hospitals to GWV and NDV. This project is now completed. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTON ES): Several manuscripts hav e been published, one is in press. No new studies are in progress. However, these data may have future use in testing additional hypotheses regarding specific subgroups of Gulf War Veterans and specific birth defect diagnoses. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Publications.

SPECIFIC AIMS: Do GWVs have higher rates of adverse reproductive outcomes such as miscarriages, early pregnancy loss, prematur ity and low birth weight when compared to NDVs? METHODOLOGY: A structured, self-completed, quest ionnaire was mailed to 17,166 service members (active duty, reserves, or National Guard) who were, on February 1, 1991, aged between 18-33 and either: married at that time; or currently married. Detailed demographic, military and deployment status, and reproductive outcome data through the end of 1995 were collected for the subject and their marital partner. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): Mailing of que stionnaires complet ed (Fall, 1997); data cleanup and telephone callback interviews are in process (target completion: Spring, 1998). In another study, we are examining the characterizati ons of adverse reproductive and perinatal effects among conceptions, which occurred just prior to or during deployment to the Persian Gulf War theater. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Initial mailing to the randomly selected GWVs and NDVs was completed the summer of 1996; two follow-up ma ilings to increase the participation rate were completed in winter 1996 and summer 1997, resp ectively. Despite 3 attempts, use of locator services, and certified mail or military channels for non-active duty and active duty subjects respectively, questionnaires were undeliverable to 2,503 of the initial 17,166 mailed questionnaires. At the completion of the mailing phase, a total of 9,691 questionnaires had been returned, giving an overall participation rate of 66.1%. With respec t to the telephone callback interviews to date, 750 (42.8%) are in process, 456 (26.1%) have been co mpleted or were noncontactable/did not require contact, and 545 (31.1%) pending/with Kamens Sato PA, Gray GC.

Project #: DoD-1E Agency: DoD Study Location: Naval Health Research Center Project Status: Ongoing Research Type: Epidemiology Research P.I.: CDR Greg Gray, MC, Research Focus: Symptoms/General Health Start Date (CY): 1996 Est. Completion (CY): 2013 OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: To study the health of Navy Seabees in relation to their deployments and the possible latent effects of Gulf War service. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1. To determine if Gulf War Ve terans have greater frequen cy of symptoms, illness, and propensity for making cognitive errors than ot her veterans; 2. to assemble a cohort for research on long-term effects of the Gulf War on morbidity. METHODOLOGY: The proposed study is a nonconcurr ent historical prospective study of all Seabees who were active duty for at least one month between August 2, 1990 and June 30, 1991. This group of approximately 17,500 current active duty, re servists, and former military personnel has been identified from records of the Defense Manpower Data Center. The study subjects will be mailed a survey to assess their current health status and t heir role (if any) in the Persian Gulf War. It is proposed that participants in the survey will be followed prospectiv ely for 15 years with a follow-up survey every 5 years (in 2002, 2007, and 2012) to det ect possible latent effects of the Gulf War on health. Potential sequelae include heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, & arthritis. To evaluate reliability of information, 400 of the survey participants will be interviewed by telephone and information on health and symptomatology from routine physicals will be collected from military medical records. Bivarate and multivariate anal yses will be used to identify risk factors associated with the outcomes of interest and multivariate l ogistic regression modeling will be applied to evaluate relationships between risk factors and the health outcomes. Development of latent chronic disease will be monitored by calculating the cumulative prevalence rates after each 5-year survey follow-up and comparing the baseline prevalence. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES) : Expect to complete data collection by July 1998. Baseline survey data showing initial symptom pr evalences should be available by August 1998. Subsequent analyses of symptom and morbidity dat a from written and telephone surveys are planned by March 2003, March 2008, and March 2013. A comprehensive report showing comparisons between Gulf War veterans and other veterans including a summary of risk factor associations with morbidity is projected for December 2013. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Pilot test of the su rvey instrument has been completed. The first mailing resulted in approximately 33 percent part icipation among those who received the survey. Presently, we are in the second mailing of the questionnaire. PUBLICATIONS: Dlugosz LJ, Gray GC, Knoke J, Kang HK, Larson G.

Completion (CY): 1998 OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: To determine if t he federal and non-federal hospitalizations rates differed among Gulf War Veterans (GWV) and no ndeployed veterans (NDV) during the study period of 1 August 1991 to 31 December 1994. SPECIFIC AIMS: The specific rese arch questions this project will address include: Did the causes for hospitalization among GWV and NDV differ in (1 ) military and (2) nonfederal facilities? Did the proportional distribution of causes for hospital ization differ during the postwar follow-up period? METHODOLOGY: The study population will consist of GWV and NDV who resided in California after the Gulf War. Military hospitalization and demographic data have been obtained from the Department of Defense Manpower Data Center (DMD C). Each hospitalization contains a principal diagnosis that is classified into 1 of the 14 major classifications of disease and injuries as defined by the ICD-9-CM. Information on nonfederal hospit alization has been obtained for California residents from two sources: (1) The Office of Statewide Planning and Development (OSHPD), which maintains the Patient Discharge Data Program, a database of hospital discharge information from all non-federally licensed hospitals in California and (2 ) the Department of Veterans Affairs Patient Treatment File (VAPTF) of all VA hospitalizat ions. Two hospitalization data links have been performed. The DMDC demographic and identification data will be linked with OSHPD data and the VAPTF to obtain nonfederal hospitalization data fo r GWV and NDV. The proportional distribution of causes for hospitalization for GWV and NDV during the postwar follow-up period will be compared. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILEST ONES): Expect study completion by September 1998. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: A computerized lin king program was designed by the California OSHPD to enable linkage of their database of nonfed eral hospital discharge information to a NHRC database consisting of identifying demographic dat a for GWV and NDV. Negotiations for the terms of these collaboration were completed and data pr ovided to OSHPD in Spring 1997. Data were linked and returned to NHRC in late November 1997. The data provided to the VA in Spring 1997 was linked and returned to NHRC in July 1997. The analysis of the data is in progress. A manuscript is under development.

Project #: DoD-1G Agency: DoD Study Location: Naval Health Research Center Project Status: Ongoing Research Type: Epidemiology Research P.I.: CDR Gregory Research Focus: oductive Health Start Date (CY): 1995 Est. Completion (CY): 1998 OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: To determine if the prevalence of congenital anomalies in the infants born to Gulf War Veterans (GWV) exceed those of infants of (1) nondeployed veterans (NDV) and (2) the nonmilitary population. SPECIFIC AIMS: The specific re search questions this project w ill address include: (1) Did the prevalence of congenital anomalies differ among infants of GWV, NDV, and the nonmilitary population prior to and after the Persian Gulf War? (2) Did the types of congenital anomalies differ among infants of GWV, NDV, and the nonmilitary po pulation prior to and following the Persian Gulf War? (3) What were the pathologic patterns of co ngenital anomalies among infants born to GWV? How did these characteristics differ by military su bpopulations (e.g., service, occupation, geographic location)? METHODOLOGY: The Department of Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) maintains a database of demographic, military and hospitalization data among military personnel. The state health departments of Arizona, Arkansas, California, Ge orgia, Hawaii, Iowa, and Oklahoma conduct active surveillance of congenital anomalies through the initia l 12 months of life. Live births and fetal deaths occurring after 20 weeks of gestation are record ed in Birth and Death Certificate Records of the Vital Statistics Registries of these states. Two registry matches will be perfo rmed. The DMDC database will be matched with Vital Statistics Registry of each of these seven states to i dentify live births and fetal deaths occurring among conceptions of GWV and NDV between 1989 and 1993. Names and other personal identifiers common to the DMDC and Vital St atistics Registries will be matched with the Birth Defects Registry of each state. Overall and diagnostic-specific rates of congenital anomalies will be calculated and compared among infants of GWV and NDV and the nonmilitary population of each state. Univariate analysis will be applied to compare rates between subpopulations. Multivariate techniques will be applied to identify characteristics associated with congenital malformations. Cluster analysis will be performed to detect interrelations among selected anomalies and subpopulations. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): The overall as well as diagnostic-specific prev alence rates of congenital anomalies among infants of GWV and NDV will be determined. Pathologic patterns of congenital malformations among infants of GWV will be described, and may serve useful in developing hypotheses about genetically or env ironmentally-induced birth defects for future investigations. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Data provided by the Hawaii Birth Defects Monitoring Program is being analyzed to compare overall and diagnostic-sp ecific rates of birth defects. Birth defect data among infants of GWV and NDV in Arizona are complete for 1989-1991; the Arizona Birth Defect Monitoring Program is still collecting data for 1992- 1993 births. Identification of births to military personnel in Metropolitan Atlanta is complete; lin kage to the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program is in progress to identify military infants with birth defects. Identification of births to military personnel in California and Arkansas are in progress. Collaborative agreements are being negotiated with Iowa. Seeking participation from Oklahoma.

Persian Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Research Database - Project No DoD-2 Title: Physiological and Neurobehavioral Effects in Rodents from Pyridostigmine, Fuels, and J Rossi, Ph.D. Research Focus: Interactions Start Date (CY): 1994 Est. Completion (CY): 1997 Pyridostigmine Bromide Brain & Nervous System OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: This project has evaluated the potential of a simulated Gulf War (GW) exposure consisting of multiple chemic als, alone and in conjunction with an imposed psychological stressor, to induce biological e ffects in Sprague-Dawley rats. Effects were for similarity to symptoms and effects reported by ex posed Gulf War veterans (e.g., \"Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses\" (GWVI)). No animal model for GWI currently exists; therefore, t he project investigated if the rodent model can reproduce the symptoms reported in GWI. SPECIFIC AIMS: This study tested the hypothesis th at simultaneous exposure to a combination of chemical stressors, each well tolerated indivi dually, causes subtle physiological changes when coupled with psychological stress. The study used Sprague-Dawley rats as an animal model to identify effects reported by humans similarly ex posed during the GW. The study also attempted to identify biomarkers for use in evaluating the extent of exposure and of effect in humans. METHODOLOGY: The chemical stressors and routes of exposure evaluated were: inhalation of fuel vapor (diesel, jet fuel) and their combustion products, dermal absorption of the insect repellent, N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), and oral (or i.p.) administration of pyridostigmine bromide (PB). Psychological stress was simulated by intermittent administration of a mild electrical shock. The shock was administered randomly by a computer controlled apparatus, so that it would be uncontrollable and unpredictable, functioning as a traumatic stressor. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed by inhalation to diesel and/or jet f uel vapor, orally to PB, and dermally to DEET, alone, and in various combinations. Half of the animals received a periodic, random, mild electrical shock as psychological and neurobehavioral changes by standard tests, immediately after exposure and after a 60-day latent period. The study investigated physiological and neurobehavioral effects, neurotransmitter levels, and changes in protein composition in serum/plasma, liver, kidney, testes, and brain from exposed rats. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): This study evaluated the potentia l of a simulated Gulf War (GW) exposure consisting of multiple chemical exposures, alone and exacerbated by an imposed psychological stressor, to induce toxic effe cts in Sprague-Dawley rats which may have some similarities to the symptoms reported by Gulf Wa r veterans. This study investigated, in a rodent model, factors that may have contributed to the development of symptoms reported in GWI. Representative chemical exposures from the GW theater, with and without an imposed psychological stressor, were investigated individually and in comb inations to determine possible interactive effects. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Almost all of the signi ficant differences in this study involved animals exposed to JP4 fuel vapor only, or in combinatio ns of JP4 or footshock and pyridostigmine bromide and DEET. Differences between groups in the 14 day neurobehavioral study were found only for startle (JP4, stress, stress & JP4) and for appetite reinforcer approach (JP4). In the 60 day study, differences were observed in a variety of measures on the Navy Neurobehavioral Toxicity Assessment Battery (NTAB) for combinations of stressors which included JP 4 or footshock. The results suggest the JP4 fuel vapor and/or JP4 in co mbination with footshock stress affect a variety of neurobehavioral tests. A manuscript is bei ng prepared for peer-review ed publication of these results. PUBLICATIONS: Nelson RA.

DC Project Type: Epidemiology Research P.I.: Marlowe Research Focu s: Symptoms/General Health Start Date (CY): 1992 Est. Completion (CY): 1994 OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Assess the general sense of well-being of Gulf War era veterans in the States of Hawaii and Pennsylvania. SPECIFIC AIMS: Identify groups within the populat ion reporting physical or mental distress and highlight probable causes or contributing factors. Ascertain whether any group within this population was at risk for future development of PTSD relate d to their Gulf War era experiences. Evaluate the status of the 14th Quartermaster Detachment. Assess the impact of the casualties of the 14th Quartermaster Detachment on the community of Greensburg, Pennsylvania. METHODOLOGY: Citizens of Pennsylvania an d Hawaii who served during the period of Operation Desert Shield/Storm were identified and asked to participate in a survey involving questionnaires and interviews (approx. 14,100). Study materials were designed and administered; 4,334 responses were obtained. Data was integr ated with responses from an additional 25,000 individuals being studied as part of a larger asse ssment. Survey instruments and methods included a questionnaire, Impact of Events Scale, Brie f Symptom Inventory, PTSD Risk Algorithm, and records/reports from Pacific Center for PTSD and from PTSD Clinical Team, VA Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA. The distribution of psychologi cal and illness symptoms in the samples were analyzed, and differences in psychological and physical symptoms between deployers and nondeployers were examined. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES) : An assessment of the general physical and mental well-being of the subject population. Informatio n to assist Congressional determination of the need for appropriated funds for specialized counseling and support services to counter any adverse effects of service during Operation Desert Shield/Storm. Information addressing potential links between service in the Gulf and subsequent health and adjustment difficulties upon return. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: The studied populati on was generally well-adjusted, with subgroups experiencing either physical symptoms, high levels of stress, or both (about 15% of the population). Among those deployed and who reported physical sy mptoms, neither exposure to combat nor its aftermath bear much relationship to their distress . Only the fact of deployment explains the higher rate of physical symptoms compared those who were not deployed. About 15% of those deployed were experiencing both stress and physical symptoms at the time of the study. Many of these seem at risk for development of further difficulty, particularly PTSD.

Co mpletion (CY): 1999 Treatment OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Combat stress reaction (CSR) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are thought to be part of a common spectrum of disorders. It is essential to develop animal models for combat stress reaction, to identif y neurochemical mechanisms of, and pharmaceutical countermeasures for combat stress effects. Em phasis is on rapidly acting countermeasures which could be administered far forward, and which would allow the stress casualty to remain on duty and prevent the development of PTSD. Pharmaceutic al countermeasures must be free of unwanted side effects, such as sedation or im pairment of memory or performance. SPECIFIC AIMS: Evaluate clinical and pre-clinical pharmaceuticals to pr event/reverse conditioned defeat (CD). Use acoustic startle, the swim te st, neuroendocrine markers and telemetric monitoring of heart rate in behaving, unrestrained animals ex posed to threat, develop technology for predicting vulnerability to conditioned defeat; thus enhanci ng evaluation of possible preventive measures. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES) : FY 97: Examine the effect of valium on CD in another species (mice) to test the generality of the finding that valium may exacerbate CD (and might be contraindicate in combat stress reaction). Ex tend testing to include benzodiazepine antagonists and inverse agonists in mice. In addition, begin testi ng Buspirone, a clinically available, non-sedating, non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic drug in mouse CD model. Will also test its more potent pre-clinical analogs - Gepirone, ipsapirone, and tiaspirone. The startle response has been reported to be exaggerated in both CSR and PTSD. Accordingly, we will test the effect of CD on acoustic startle in the mouse. To identify potential aids to diagnosis of risk for CSR, we will further characterize hormonal responses to CD. FY 98: Begin testing ot her behaviorally active clinically-available drugs in mouse CD model: (a) beta blockers (atenolol); (b ) antidepressants used in panic disorders (Prozac, tricyclics); (c) stimulants such as caffeine and amphetamine. Evaluate all listed compounds for capability to reverse CD-induced def icits in the swim test. FY 99: Begin testing novel pre-clinical, non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics in the CD model, including releasing hormone antagonists; and Neuropeptide therapeutic ng hormone (TRH) - an endogenous peptide stimulant successfully employed to reverse learned helplessness. Target drug intervention at specific brain sites, study viable brain slices from defeated mice, including amygdala and hippocampus, to evaluate agents for selective effects on specific circuits in volved in CD. Study the effects of CD on cognitive function and neurodegeneration. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: By establishing a streamline model of conditioned defeat (CD), we have met the requirement of developing an animal model for testing diagnostics for component processes of combat stress reaction (CSR) and screening drugs for safe, rapid treatment. We have shown that CD markedly decreases activity in t he swim test - a measure used in the pharmaceutical industry to screen antidepressants. In an effort to develop reliable predictors and clinical indicators for CSR, we have characterized the dramatic responses to CD of hormones stimulated via the anxiogenic peptide, corticotrophi n releasing hormone (CRH). We have shown that acoustic startle response (ASR) in hamsters was exacerbated by adm inistration of CRH. This is significant because exaggerated acoustic startle response has been validated as a biological marker for PTSD and reported as a symptom of CSR as well. We foun d that valium is clearly counterproductive as a treatment for hamsters, as it markedly exacer bated CD. Thus, the CD model affords us the capability of identifying drugs which might be contraindicate d, as well as those which might be beneficial. By way of confirmation, an Israeli colleague is r eporting that benzodiazepines fail to block the development of PTSD following trauma. We have op timized the CD model as a test bed for screening drugs by modifying it to deliver rapid, high-volume, low-cost throughout.

Completion (CY): 1998 Diagnosis Prevention OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Develop diagnosti c instruments for far-forward, early diagnosis of soldiers at risk for combat stress reaction (CSR) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to allow early intervention to prevent chronic PTSD. SPECIFIC AIMS: Use combined neuroendocrine and psychophysiologic tec hniques to develop rapid, reliable and inexpensive means of determining soldiers' level of stress, fitness for duty and risk of CSR/PTSD. METHODOLOGY: We will measure salivary levels of cortisol, testosterone, and dehydroxyepiandosterenedione sulfate (DHEAS) as stress indices. We will critically evaluate the reliability of voice frequency modulation as a stress index. In collaboration with the New Haven VA Medical Center we will conduct a prospective study on risk of st ress reactions/PTSD in Special Operations Forces. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): FY 96: Correlate salivary cortisol and Soldier of the performance; measure effect of st ress on salivary testosterone and DHEAS. FY 97: Determine effect of psychological stress on voic e frequency modulation spectrum and correlate with performance as well as physiological and hormonal changes. FY 98: Complete prospective study of changes in acoustic startle and dexamethasone suppression tests (using salivary cortisol measurements) in soldiers subjected to stressful deployments. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Ongoing. Because the \"Soldier of the Month (SOM) Board\" is a uniquely robust physiological stressor, we have been using it as a test bed to develop and validate field-ready stress measures, such as a battery of non-invasive (salivary) hormonal measures. We will use these measures in stress studies in sold iers at risk for combat stress reaction and/or PTSD during military operations in the field. We hav e characterized the psychoendocrine and autonomic profile of operational stress, using the SOM Boar d as a model. Elevated plasma and salivary cortisol levels were measured in soldie rs after an SOM Board experience. We have identified several plasma hormones which correlate positively with anxie ty, and have demonstrated that anticipatory anxiety predicts poor performance.

Persian Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Research Database - Project No DoD-7A Title: Health Risk Assessment of Embedded Depleted Uranium: Behavior, Physiology, Histology, and Biokinetic Modeling Project #: DoD AFRRI, MD Type: Basic Research P.I.: Terry Pellmar, Ph.D. Research Focus: Depleted Uranium Start Date (CY): 1994 Est. Completion (CY): 1998 Environmental Toxicology OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Evaluate health risks associated with tissue-embedded depleted uranium (DU) fragments by studying the behavioral, physiological, and histological consequences of implanted DU in a rodent model. SPECIFIC AIMS: Evaluations in the DU-implanted rodent model included: be havioral tests of motor activity and memory, conduction studies of perip heral nerve function, measurement of central nervous system excitability in brain slice prepar ations, biochemical assessments of renal function, histological assessment of local tissue dam age and capsule formation, measurement of tissue concentrations of uranium, and development of a biokinetic model describing the distribution of uranium over time. METHODOLOGY: Appropriate doses to be used for analysis of DU effects were defined and then a study of 325 rats was conducted to obtain toxicity data. Rats were randomly assigned to 5 treatment groups: 1) low-dose DU, 2) medium-dose DU, 3) high-dose DU, 4) tantalum (Ta) controls, and 5) non-implanted sham-surgical controls. In the lo w-dose and medium-dose groups, Ta was substituted for a fraction of the DU pellets to keep the tota l number of implanted fragments constant. Rats were evaluated, euthanized and tissue samples taken at 1, 6, 12, or 18-months following fragment implantation. The investigators determined that sa mple sizes of 15 rats per group were necessary to achieve statistical significance, and additional ani mals (20 rather than 15) were implanted for the 18-month time point with the expectation of a 20- 25% natural mortality. Each rat was thoroughly evaluated for changes in behavior (functional ba ttery, motor activity, passive avoidance test), peripheral nerve function (conduction velocity measurements ), CNS excitability (hippocampal brain slice electrophysiology), renal function (pla sma and urine biochemistries) and tissue histology including capsule formation. In addition, dat a on tissue uranium levels (measured by kinetic phosphorescence analysis) from a subgroup of rats was used to develop a biokinetic model to predict uranium distribution. All measured parameters were compared among groups through analysis of variance and significa nce accepted at the P<0.05 level. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): Determine appropriate doses for a DU toxicity study in the rat: July 1995. Complete toxicity assess ment at the one-month point: Dec 1995. Complete toxicity assessment at the six-month point: Dec 19 96. Complete toxicity assessment at the 12-month point: June 1997. Complete toxicity assessment at the 18-month point: Dec 1997. Complete biokinetic modeling for distribution of DU fragments: Jan 1998. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: As of the 12-month time point, examination of the pellets in situ revealed fibrous tissue adhering to the DU but not the Ta pellets. Uranium levels were high and dose-dependent in kidney, urine, and bone. Despite high uranium levels in kidney, no renal toxicity was evident. After 23 weeks, body weight in high-DU dose animals was significantly lower than controls. Unexpectedly, uranium was found in the brain of DU-implanted animals. No behavioral neurotoxicity was evident. However, excitability of hippocampal neurons was altered in the high-DU dose animals at 6 months and in all of the DU gr oups at 12 months. These data suggest that kidney toxicity may be less of a hazard than was antici pated but that cognitive deficits need to be further considered. Data for the 18-month time point are currently being collected. PUBLICATIONS: Hogan J, Benson KA, Landauer M, Pellmar TC. Toxicity of embeddedDepleted Uranium (DU) in the rat.

Completion (CY): 1998 Environmental Toxicology OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Assess the ca rcinogenic risks associated with long-term exposure to DU-containing shrapnel in wounds using a rodent model. SPECIFIC AIMS: Determine the carcinogenicity of radioa ctive DU fragments in tissues relative to nonradioactive (tantalum) foreign-body fragments, and correlate urine and kidney concentrations of uranium with time after implantation of DU fragments. METHODOLOGY: Relative carcinogenicity of embedded DU fragments was determined using test metals, in the form of flat squar es, surgically implanted into the muscles of rats. Thorotrast was used as a positive control radioactive material. These animals will be observed for tw o years for the onset, incidence, and biological characteristics of tumors developing at the site of implantation. The incidence of subcutaneous tumors will be compared among dose groups by using a Cox proportional hazards model. Renal toxicity of chronic uranium exposure will be studied after determination of the time course to achieve a steady-state renal DU concentration from an implanted source. Urinalysis will include U concentration and biochemical indicators of kidney fu nction. Rats will be examined for lesions, with particular attention to the urinary system. Kidneys will be examined histologically for lesions related to U toxicity. U content in the kidney and skel eton and remainder of the carcass will be determined. Laser phosphorimetry is being used to analyze tissue and urine samples for U. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): The carcinogenic hazard of radi oactive DU fragments relative to nonradioactive fragments is being det ermined so that informed judgements can be made about the clinical management of veterans with DU fragments embedded in their soft tissues. Milestones of this study are: May 1997: Initiati on of the long-term study of potential carcinogenic effects of implanted DU fragments. May 1999: Completion of the long-term carcinogenesis of DU fragments. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: A preliminary 60-day study determined that t he solubility of implanted DU was less than DU alloyed with Titanium (DUTi) in both rats and mice, and early histological responses to implanted DU were less than DUTi. The surface of both metals was visibly roughened after 30 days. These features indicated that t he subcutaneous implantation model of foreign body carcinogenesis, as described by Brand et al (1975 ) is not appropriate to study the carcinogenesis of implanted DUTi. Accordingly, a revised protocol was used for the long-term study: Du (0.75% Ti) fragments in 3 sizes were implanted into the leg muscles of rats. Using 3 sizes resulted in rats receiving a mass of metal that ranged across a factor of 20 and a surface radioactivity that ranged a factor of 10. In addition, a group of rats receiv ed tantalum fragments of similar sizes to serve as negative control animals, and a group of rats receiv ed Thorotrast injections to serve as positive control animals for radioactive materials.

Persian Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Research Database - No Project Status: Completed Research Type: Applied Research P.I.: COL D Gordon Research Focus: Leishmaniasis Start Date (CY): 1993 Est. Completion (CY): 1996 Diagnosis OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Develop a reliable serologic test for viscerotropic leishmaniasis. SPECIFIC AIMS: The goal was to identify an antibody (Ab)-based serologic assay to detect active infection with Leishmania parasites causing the clinical syndrome of VTL using a standard format such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). METHODOLOGY: Use of ELISA-based assays to dia gnose active infection with an infectious agent is a widely accepted and useful diagnostic in tervention. Currently, t here are no commercially available serologic assays to detect Leishmania in fection. Some specialty labs use the indirect immunofluorescence technique (IFAT) format to detect antibodies to surface proteins of the promastigote (insect vector form of the parasite); ho wever, the IFAT is not useful in VTL. Once the parasite is injected into humans by the sand-fly vector, it transforms into an amastigote (the form found in mammals). The amastigote is a genetically different morphologic form which expresses a unique repertoire of antigens. This effort is based on the hypothesis that these amastigote dominant antigens hold the key to serologic diagnosis of VTL. Using recombinant molecular biology techniques, proteins which are recognized by VTL sera can be made in large quantities and used as capture antigens in ELISA tests. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES) : Identification of reactive clones made from screening a genomic library of Leishmania DNA, cloning and se quencing the recombinant proteins and using the recombinant proteins to screen sera from patients with viscerotropic leishmaniasis (VTL). STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: A genomic library was made from a Desert Storm isolate of Leishmania. Parasite DNA was sheared and introduced into E. coli via phage virus. Bacterial clones with parasite DNA were transferred to nitrocellulose and then incubated with radioiodinated protein labeled VTL sera. Reactive clones were th en isolated, induced, and protein was sequenced. Patients with VTL appear to recognize a 210 kd recombinant protein, called Lt-1, the carboxy third of the protein is made of repeats. Smaller recomb inant proteins and synthetic peptides based on the repeats have been made. To date, none of these peptides reliably discriminates infected from noninfected samples.

Persian Veterans' Illnesses Research Database - Project No DoD-8B Title: Development of a Leishmania Skin Test #: DoD-8B Agency: DoD Location: WRAIR, Project Status: Ongoing Research Type: Applied Research P.I.: COL D Gordon Research Focus: Leishmaniasis Start Date (CY): 1993 Est. Completion (CY): 2000 Diagnosis OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Develop a reliable skin test for Leishmania infection. SPECIFIC AIMS: The goal is to identify a safe , potent, and non-sensitizing LSTA; manufacture it under cGMP; and obtain an IND for its use in phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials, and ultimately, a commercially availabl e , FDA-licensed product. METHODOLOGY: Skin tests are widely accepted di agnostic interventions for diagnosis of prior infection with an infectious agent (e.g., tuberculosi s). Currently there is no Leishmania skin test licensed for use in the USA or available under an IND. Once required phase 1 and phase 2 studies are completed in humans, studies could be perfo rmed in Gulf War veterans with confirmed and suspected leishmaniasis. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES) : Completion of the IND application by 4th Quarter FY96 and completion of phase 1 study by 2nd Quarter FY97. Phase 2 trials in FY97-98. Phase 3 trials in 98. Licensure by 2000. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Microfluidized-lysa te (MFL)-LSTA, Lot 0172, was manufactured under cGMP in May 1995. Pre-clinical testing in guine a pigs and non-human primates has proved it to be safe and potent. A similar product has sensitized naive guinea pigs on repetitive testing but whether this will occur in humans is not known. SDS-PAGE analysis of pr oduct substance, final container product and following heat treatment has shown the MFL-LSTA to be stable. IND submitted to FDA on 6/2/96 and approved on 16 Nov 96. Recruitment for phase 1 clinical trial began in December 96 and the phase 1 clinical trial was performed between 18 Feb 97 and 20 May 97. Sixty-six doses of MFL-LSTA, lot 0172, were given to 15 volunteers. The product proved to be safe and well tolerated in the volunteers; however, 2 volunteers exhibit ed a type 1 allergic cutaneous response to the antigenand placebo formulation. The most likely ca use is pre-existing hypersensitivity to dextran, a component of the lyophyilization buffer. A reformulation LSTA is currently being made to eliminate the need for lyophilized product with dextran. T he reformulated placebo was manufactured under cGMP in June 97 and the antigen was made in Aug 97. Final container testing is ongoing and revised IND information was submitted to the FD A in Nov 97. An abbreviated (one dose) phase 1 clinical trial is being performed at WRAIR in Ja n 98. Phase Iia dose ranging and potency trials are planned for Peru, Brazil, and Kenya in calendar year 98.

Persian Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Research Database - Project No DoD-9 Title: Identification of the Genetic Fa ctors Which Control Grogl/Callahan Research Leishmaniasis Start Date (CY): 1994 Est. Co mpletion (CY): 1998 Treatment OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Identify the gene(s) that control tropism in Leishmania and determine its (their) sequence and function. SPECIFIC AIMS: The goal of this research is to identify the gene(s) that control tropism in Leishmania. The identification of a \"tropism\" gene will enable the development of specific gene probes (primers) to be used in a patient screening pr ogram to identify those at risk of reactivation of latent infections; address the fundamental questi on of infectious disease pathophysiology, namely why an organism infects a particular cell; optimize treatment regimens according to Leishmania species and the immune status of the host. The i dentification of the genetic factor(s) involved in the visceralizaiton of Leishmania will require development in vitro and in vivo models of tropism to facilitate the study of viscerotropic leishmaniasis (diagnosis, therapy, prevention) and Leishmania tropism. METHODOLOGY: Develop in vitro and in vivo models of Leishmania tropism to use for the determination of the genetic factors controlling tr opism: a promastigote temperature sensitivity model; and a cutaneous and visceral animal model of Leishmania tropism. Create Leishmania mutants with altered tropism in the in vitro and in vivo models of tropism: temperature sensitive parasites changed to resistant and visa versa; and cutaneous parasites (in the animal model) changed to visceral and visa versa. Use recent ly developed molecular genetic techniques to restore the original (wild-type) phenotype to the Leishm ania temperature with Leishmania cosmid DNA libra ries. Identify the gene(s) controlling temperature sensitivity and tropism present in the cosmid(s) which restore(s) a wild-type phenotype to the Leishmania cells. Retest the function of these genes in both models using transfection methodology. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): Molecular characterization includes Identific ation of the genes present in the cosmids which restore a wild-type phenotype to the Leishmania mutants, squencing the genes by 1998, and determining the homologies with genes in the database by 1998. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: An in vitro promas tigote temperature model was developed and the investigators determined that temperature sensitivit y in vitro correlates with Leishmania tropism in vivo. There is no absolute temperature requirement for dermotropism, but there is a minimum temperature resistance requirement for visceraliz ation. The parasite st rains that have an unusual tropism in the human host (to include the viscerotrop ic L. tropica from Dese rt Storm) also show an unexpected temperature sensitivit y in the model. Two animal models were developed where the tropism of the Leishmania strain is known, uni form, and reproducible (all organisms are found in one location, either visceral or cutaneous) when inoculated in the skin (sc) to mimic a sand fly bite, including a cutaneous model with no visceralizati on, and a visceral model with no skin lesions. Leishmania temperature sensitive and resistant mu tants have been obtained. Laboratory techniques were developed and standardized for transfection and for the Leishmania cosmid DNA library. An L. donovani and two L. tropica temperature-resistant strains were selected in vitro. An L. mexicana strain was chemically mutagenized and a tropism mutant was selected in our hamster model. Wild-type DNA cosmid libraries were made of all the Leishmania strains (4) that will be mutagenized and selected for altered tropism in the hamster model.

Persian Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Research Database - Project No DoD-10 Title: Pyridostigmine CHPPM, Aberdeen MD Project Status: Completed Research Type: Basic Research P.I.: Dr. McCain Research Fo cus: Pyridostigmine Bromide Start Date (CY): 1994 Est. Comp letion (CY): 1994 Interactions OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Determine potent ns when pyridostigmine bromide, permethrin, and DEET are giv en concurrently to male rats by gavage. SPECIFIC AIMS: Phase I determined the acute oral lethal dose response relationship of each compound with the propylene glycol solution in which it was delivered. Phase II was a dose response study using results from Phase I as well as calculated dosage solutions of the three materials in combinations. This study was moti vated by concerns about t he possible synergism of pyridostigmine taken by the servicemembers in ODS to protect them against potential nerve agent exposure and permethrin and DEET, insecticides which were used at the same time. METHODOLOGY: The first phase was the developm ent of acute oral lethal dose-response relationship of each compound with the vehicle, determine dosage levels for the second phase. Part 1 of Phase II served as a positive control for t he interaction portion of the study and verified data obtained from Phase I. The Part 1 dose response study used dosing developed from Phase I. Part 2 of Phase II was similar to the control portion except that the vehicle contained the calculated LD16 of the other two compounds. The Phase I study protocol used 16 groups of 10 animals each, with one group of 10 receiving only the propylene glycol vehicle. Gross necropsy was performed on all animals as soon as possible after death. Animals surviving the 14 day study period were sacrificed and examined for gross pathological lesions. The Phase II study used 15 groups of six animals each for the positive control portion and 18 groups of 10 animals each for the interaction portion. Animals were necropsied and examined for gross pathological lesions. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): Report on toxicity produced by high dose interactions of military materiel and medical pretreatments. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: The principal finding was that at extraordinarily high doses, there is an increased mortality in rats given pyridostigmi ne bromide, permethrin, and DEET simultaneously by gavage when compared to expected additive lethal effect of the individual compounds. The direct significance of these findings to ground forces who served in the Gulf War is uncertain because these doses and route of exposure do not co rrespond to any suspected human exposures.

Completion (CY): 2001 OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Develop a series of simple diagnostic assays suitable for forward deployed preventive medicine teams, Ar ea Medical, and Forward Laboratories. SPECIFIC AIMS: Develop rapid and simple diagnostic tests to permit the identification of the causes of infection outbreaks before they reach the epidemic stat e. Serological assays are being developed for typhus fever, dysenteries caused by shigella and other bacteria, and leptospirosis. Tests utilizing polymerase chain reaction (PCR ) technology are being explored for diagnosing dengue fever. Fluorescent assays for malaria and other parasitic diseases are under investigation. Hand-held chromatographic immunoassays are being developed for dengue fever. Future applications include campylobacter, malaria, and ar boviral and rickettsial disease agents. Dipstick technology is being developed for dengue fever as well as rickettsial disease agents responsible for scrub and endemic typhus, and spotted fever group diseases. METHODOLOGY: Technologies used in this research program center on hand-held chromatographic immunoassays, electrochemiluminescence (ECL) detection, polymerase chain reaction assays, dip-stick assays. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES) : Forward deployable assays using immunochemical-based assays against dengue, hanta-, and selected hem orrhagic fever viruses are expected to reach Milestone I in 4QFY98. Confirmatory polymerase chain reaction assays with high specificity and sensitivity are expected to reach M ilestone I in 4QFY98 were conducted. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Sensitive and specific enzyme-linked immunoassays are currently available for the detection of selected antigens, or anti-agent IgG/IgM antibodies for a select group of infectious diseases. Application of chroma tographic assay technology occurred in FY96 with completed products available in FY98. Prototy pe polymerase chain reaction assays are currently available for dengue virus, malaria, shigella, ET EC, hemorrhagic fever viruses, and hantaviruses. New PCR technology that will allow hand held detec tion is currently being explored. Evaluation of fieldable reagents and validation of the assays will continue at least until FY98. Initial laboratory development is completed for dip-stick assays for scrub and endemic typhus; dip-sticks for rickettsial spotted fever group and dengue fever disease agents are in progress.

Persian Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Research Database - Project No DoD-13 Title: Effects of Persian Gulf War Service on Military Working Dogs Project #: DoD-13 Agency: DoD Study Location: AFIP, Wash. Research Type: Epidemiology Research P.I.: LTC R Moeller Research Fo cus: Environmental Toxicology Start Date (CY): 1994 Est. Completion (CY): 2001 OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: The possibility of exposure to environmental factors and endemic diseases exist for the population of military workin g dogs (MWDs) that deployed to the Persian Gulf (PG) theater of war. The question to be answer ed is: In the final analysis, what are the differences in diagnoses between the PG MWD cohort and a matched (on the basis of age, sex and breed) comparison group which never deployed to Southwest Asia (SWA). SPECIFIC AIMS: The (null) hypotheses to be tested is that in the final analysis there will be no differences in the diagnoses between the PG MWD cohort and the comparison group which never deployed to SWA. Should this hypothesis not be supported: 1) the possibility exists that differences in diagnoses between the two groups ma y be the result of deployment to SWA; and 2) dates of deployment and location in theater will be compared among the PG MWDs, and conceivably to those of PG veterans. METHODOLOGY: The PG MWD cohort was identif ied after the cessation of hostilities and subsequent redeployment. The inclusive deployment dates for this population are 1 August 1990 to 31 December 1991. MWDs receive semi-annual physi cal examinations throughout their active duty lives, which include clinical evaluations and rout ine panels of hematologic, serologic, and blood chemical analyses. The results of these tests are recorded in the animal's medical record. Those MWDs that are euthanized will hav e peripheral blood samples collected prior to euthanasia for the above tests. When natural death oc curs, the most recent blood test w ill be used. Test results are to be included in the dog's permanent medical record. Necropsies are performed in accordance with a standard protocol contained in TB Med 283. Medical records from all deceased MWDs in the Department of Defense are archived at the DODMWDVS, Lackland AFB, Texas. Based on the assumptions of a condition with 10% prevalence in the population, looking for a relative risk of 2.5 in the exposed group, setting t he alpha level at 0.05 and the beta level at 0.2, a minimum of 112 animals of each group must be in cluded in the study. Therefore, the medical and training records of those 118 MWDs which de ployed to the Persian Gulf, and 472 non-deployed MWDs matched four to one based on age, gender and breed, will be abstracted during the study period for the following variables: animal identific ation; age at death; date of death; breed; gender; location during the time frame 1 August 1990 to 31 December 1991; duration August 1990; pathologic diagnoses of biopsy specimens and pathologic di agnoses of autopsy specimens. These data will be electronically stored in a database for statistical analysis using the SPSSR analysis program. Those 30 Persian Gulf deployed MWDs still living, and 120 age, gender, breed matched non-deployed control MWDs will be transported to the DODMWDVS, Lackland AFB when the responsible Veterinary Corps officer has determi ned the animal is no longer physically fit for duty and in need of humane euthanasia. Upon arrival, the medical record will be screened to determine the cohort of assignment. The MWD will receive a complete physical exam, to include the measurements (T4, cTSH); electrocardiography; radiography; a neurologic examination and a behavioral assessment. The MWD will be anesthetized according to a st andard approved protocol. Radiographs of elbows, stifles, coxofemoral joints and spine will be obtain ed if not present in the record. Electromyograms and nerve conduction studies will then be cond ucted on the anesthetized dog, to determine neuromuscular function. Euthanasia of the dog will be completed with a standard approved injectable euthanasia agent (Beuthanasia) and immediately necropsied in accordance with the TB Med 283. At necropsy, gross changes are described and an extensive set of tissu es collected and forwarded to the Department of Veterinary Pathology, Armed Forces Institute of Pa thology, Washington, D.C. Muscle biopsies of the biceps femoris and triceps brachii; and nerve biopsies of the tibial and radial nerves will be collected for analysis at Auburn University. Additionally, 6 gram samples of liver, kidney, lung, brain and fat will be collected for ultra low temperature fr eezing and stored at the AFIP or DoD Veterinary Laboratory until toxicological procedures may be perfor med, if indicated. Formalin fixed tissues will be processed for histopathologic examination result ing in a detailed final pathology diagnostic case report consisting of a list of pathologic findings and an interpretation of these findings. Remaining wet tissues, paraffin blocks, microslides and case folder materials will be archived. The pathology report will be forwarded to the DODMWDVS, Lackland AFB, TX for inclusion in the MWD's medical record. All clinical and pathological information collect ed during the final examination procedures will be electronically stored in a database for statistical analysis us ing the SPSSR statistical program. Upon completion of initial data and records collect ion data, a multivariate analysis of collected variables will be accomplished to determine the effe cts of age, gender and breed on those conditions commonly occurring in the entire population of MWDs. Odds ratios and ninety-five percent confidence intervals will be calculated on all cond itions occurring more frequently in one cohort to determine the effects of the exposure status on th ose conditions. Fishers' s exact p values will be calculated to determine statistical significance of any conditions occurring more frequently in one cohort. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILEST ONES): See Objectives. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Ongoing. We have identified one hundred eighteen MWDs that deployed to various locations in the PG Theater in support of operations within the inclusive dates listed above. The AFIP funded a pilot protocol ena bling the early implementation of a data collection system that includes pathologic (including surgical and post-mortem morphologic changes), demographic, and clinical findings from initially identified PG MWD cohort and matched comparison MWDs. The pilot protocol funding expired in 1995. The collection and analysis of epidemiological dat a is the primary responsibility of the US Army Veterinary Corps Officer currently stationed at the DODMWDVS, Lackland AFB, TX. Records have been collected and reviewed on 78 Persia n Gulf cohort animals and approximately 400 additional dogs that will serve as a comparison group. In January 1997, a panel of civilian veterinary m edical experts from eight different academic and industrial institutes met, as an advisory body, with investigators from the DODMWDVS and AFIP to discuss the project. The Department of Veterinary Pathology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, along with a database management consultant with expertise in SNOWMED International is near completion of the database system. This database system should be completed and ready for data entry in February 1998. Computer software and hardware ha ve been obtained to support this process. The AFIP and the DOD Veterinary Laboratory at Fort Sam Houston ,TX are storing MWD tissue specimens for toxicological analysis, if indicated. Electrophysiological myoneural diagnostic evaluation is ongoing in cohort animals already at DODMWDVS. Muscle biopsies of the biceps femoris and triceps brachii; and nerve biopsies of the tibial and radial nerves are currently being collected for electron microscopic analysis at A uburn University. Approximately 75 % of the PG MWD cohort are deceased; however, informati on and records must be collected, collated and abstracted. Clinical and pathological findings must be entered into the database management system and analyzed in order to draw conclusions and compare the two cohorts.

DC Project Status: Completed Research Type: Epidemiology Research P.I.: Jim Writer Research Fo cus: Symptoms/General Health Start Date (CY): 1993 Est. Completion (CY): 1997 OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Determine the presence of un ique characteristics (demographics, aptitude test scores, self-reported health behaviors, past hospitalizations) of Army personnel enrolled in the VA Registry of Persian Gulf veterans.. SPECIFIC AIMS: There were two sp ecific aims of this hypothesis- generating study. The first was to investigate logistical, epidemiological, and statistical methodologies for obtaining, combining, and analyzing records. These techniques will be need ed for future studies on reported post-deployment illnesses in soldiers who served in the Gulf War, and will also be applicable in evaluating the health effects of future deployments. The second aim was to determine which characteristics (to include demographics, past medical history, and health ri sk behaviors) of soldiers who have been enrolled in the VA Gulf War registry differ from those who have not enrolled. Ultimately, this information can be used to identify soldiers at a high-risk of reporting post deployment medical problems. These soldiers may be targeted for interventions before or after their deployment to reduce the risk adverse health effects attributable to service in a war zone. METHODOLOGY: Using case-control methodology the investigators st udied the association between Gulf War veterans' various demographic, medical, or health behavior characteristics and their probability of enrolling in the Gulf War regi stry. The study population consisted of individuals on the VA database and controls from the Defense Manpower Data Center's (DMDC) roster of Gulf War participants. Characteristics evaluated in cluded demographic factors, recruit applicant aptitude test scores, pre-deployment self-reported heal th behaviors, and pre-deployment health care utilization as are represented by hospitalizations in military hospita ls. These data are available in already existing Army or DoD databases, howev er, all data may not be available for all study subjects. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): A data base of US Army Gulf War veterans, which includes health indicators and demographic data from the pre, during, and post deployment phases of their military careers was gen erated. The study determined if existing data sources can be used to predict a soldier's likelihood of having signific ant post-deployment adverse health outcomes or a high level of concern about potential health effects of the deployment. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Preliminary dat a analysis presented at the Armed Forces Epidemiology Board's December 1996 meeting. Manuscript is being prepared.

Completion (CY): 1995 OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Determine if military personnel deployed to Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm have higher death rates than military personnel who did not deploy. SPECIFIC AIMS: Characterize the disease and non-battle injury (DNBI) mortality experience of US military personnel during ODS/DS. Determine whet her US military personnel deployed to Southwest Asia (SWA) had a higher rate of death t han US military personnel who did not deploy. METHODOLOGY: Casualty reports were used to ca lculate cause-specific mortality rates among all personnel on active duty in the US Armed Forces (including Reserve and National Guard) over a one-year interval that included the Persian Gulf War. Death rates among active duty personnel deployed to SWA at any time during this period we re compared to rates for all military personnel on active duty but not deployed to SWA. Each de ath was characterized as to have been most likely caused by disease or trauma. Trauma deaths were additionally classified as due to unintentional (accidental) injury, battle injury, self-inflicted inju ry, or homicide. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES) : Determination of whether US military personnel deployed to SWA had a higher death rate than non-deployed military personnel. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Except for hostile action deaths, the overall mortality experience among US military personnel who deployed did not sign ificantly differ from that observed among US military personnel who did not deploy to SWA. No evidence of clusters of unexpected deaths were found, except for two accidents.

Completion (CY): 1994 OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: To characterize both the carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic health risks to DOD troops and civilian employees exposed to the environment affected by the oil fires during and after Operation Desert Storm. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1. Environmental Monitoring - T he environmental monitoring study attempted to characterize the concentration of pollutants t hat DOD personnel were exposed to during their deployment in the Gulf region. Air monitori ng and soil sampling data were used to calculate exposure point concentrations for individual Health Risk Assessments in the final report. 2. Industrial Hygiene Sampling Study - The industrial hy giene air survey monitored and characterized occupational exposures of DOD personnel who had po tential high risk exposure to oil fire emissions. The focus was on individuals working outdoors and on wo rst-case situations within the oil fields next to Kuwait City. 3. Biological Surveillance Initia tive - The Biological Surveillance Initiative was conducted to refine and corroborate the results from the Health Risk Assessment. This was accomplished by a collection of objective bi ological measurements of exposure and effect in real-time, and by establishment of any observable biologic effect or marker of exposure to oil fire pollutants in a cohort of U.S. soldiers. METHODOLOGY: 1. Sampling and Analysis - Sampling and analytical methodologies for ambient air, soil, industrial hygiene air, biologic samples, and quality assurance procedures are detailed in the final report. 2. Risk Assessment - The methodol ogy used for this Health Risk Assessment was the EPA guidance for the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act sites (CERCLA), also known as \"Superfund\" sites. The methodology did not determine an individual's health outcome or include the use of reported h ealth effects data. The components of the risk assessment process included data collection a nd evaluation, exposure assessment, toxicity assessment, and risk characterization and uncertainty analysis. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (M ILESTONES): Reports STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Completed. The poten tial for significant long-term adverse health effects for the exposed DOD troop or civilian empl oyee populations is minimal. The total predicted excess carcinogenic risk both in Kuwait and in Saudi Arabia did not exceed 3 excess cancers per 1,000,000 population exposed. Th e predicted carcinogenic risk levels are well within the EPA range of acceptable excess carcinogenic risks. The majority (>99%) of noncarcinogenic risk at all monitoring sites is predicted to be from the inhalation of volatile organic compounds and is assessed as low. The results of the Biological Surveillance Initiative support the conclusion that noncarcinogenic risk levels indicate minimal potential adverse health effects. As of January 1998, the DoD Persian Gulf registry unit movement database contains location data for 3,198 Army units, 248 Navy sea and ground units, and 1,021 Marine Corps units. A location code is annotated for Air Force personnel in t he DoD Persian Gulf personnel database. The location code replaces the unit identification code (UIC) for tracking purposes. To date, 84,925 Air Force personnel contain location codes. The U.S. Armed Services Center for Research of Unit Records (CRUR) reviewed approximately 6 million pages of documents and has conducted f ourteen S-3/G-3 conferences. The S-3/G-3 conferences consist of former Operation Desert Sh ield / Desert Storm operations officers (at the brigade and division levels) meeting at the CRUR to review existing unit movement and location records. From the reviews, enhancements were made to the database to include data gap-fills, unit additions, and unit movement location data down to the company and detachment level. The database currently contains appr oximately 700,000 grid coordinates, latitudes/longitudes and names of base camp locations. It is important to note that the database will continue to increase in size when additional records are found. The resolution of the database will further increase because additional S-3/G-3 conferences are scheduled in 1998. PUBLICATIONS: US Army Environmental Hygiene Agen cy, Final Report.

Completion (CY): 1996 OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: To respond to Public Law 102-190 (Section 734: Troop Registry from exposure to oil well fires in Operation Desert Storm) by charac terizing the potential carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic health ris ks to U.S. military personnel exposed to the environment affected by the oil well fire s during and after Operation Desert Storm. SPECIFIC AIMS: The site-specific Kuwait Oil Fire Health Risk Assessment addressed the risks to DOD troops located at the eight fixed air/soil sa mpling sites where actual environmental data were collected and analyzed. This study will incorporate actual site data with the modeled air concentrations, exposure data, and the Troop Location Registry data, to determine the risk to U.S. military personnel that were not located at fixed sampling sites for their entry tour of duty and for periods of time when no sampling occurred. METHODOLOGY: Using a geographic information system (GIS) that is capable of mapping troop location and movement over time, in conjunction with the troop movement database, the locations of all US military personnel are being mapped during Operation Desert Storm. Once troop locations have been determined and mapped, the GIS determines troop exposure to oil fire pollution using satellite images, modeled plume boundaries, oil field crude composition data, oil field emission rates, modeled pollutant concentrations, and actual fiel d data. When troop location and exposure have been determined, the potential health risks re sulting from the exposure will be determined. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES) : The outcomes expected fr om this study will be the determination of exposure and potenti al health risks associated with oil fire pollution for U.S. military personnel participating in Operation Desert Storm. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: This project is ongoi ng. As of January 1998, the U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine ( CHPPM) is currently processing and analyzing daily oil fires exposures in support of both the oil fires Public Laws (102-190; 102-585) and the Office of the Special Assistant to the Deputy Secretary of Defense for Gulf War Illnesses (OSAGWI) oil fires case narrative. A brief summary of completed and current tasks follows. Several data sets have been obtained, developed, and integrated to characterize the potential carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic health ris ks to U.S. military personnel exposed to the environment affected by the oil fires during and after Operation Desert Storm (ODS). The data sets include daily satellite images and modeled superplume boundaries (February - October 1991); toxicological factors; exposure factors; Kuwaiti crude oil compositions; pollutant specific emission factors; the Defense Manpower Data Center's ODS personnel roster; and the U.S. Armed Services Center for Research of Unit Records (CRUR) daily unit movements. A series of computer programs have processed the data sets into listings of ODS uni ts exposed to the oil fires. The exposures are characterized by duration (i.e., number of days) and the predicted excess cancer and non-cancer values and associated ranges are provided. The ODS veterans' attached with the exposed units are currently being identified with applicable exposure data linked to the veterans' database record.

Heller Research Focus: Environmental Toxicology Start Date (CY): 1996 Est. Completion (CY): 1997 OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: To respond to Public Law 102-585 (Section 702: Scientific research using Troop Health Registry) by characterizing all potential exposures (e.g., oil fires, vaccines, chemical/biological warfare agents, pesticides, pyridostigmine bromide, etc) to U.S. military personnel participating in Operation De sert Storm, and to assess the potential health consequences of those exposures. SPECIFIC AIMS: The site-specific Kuwait Oil Fire Health Risk Assessm ent and the Troop Exposure Assessment Model (TEAM) address the potential ris ks to U.S. military personnel from potential exposure to airborne contaminants from oil well fire s. This study attempts to characterize other potential exposures experienced by U.S. military personnel during Operation Desert Storm and to assess the potential health risks/cons equences of those potential exposures. METHODOLOGY: The Persian Gulf Veterans Health Tracking System uses a geographical information system (GIS) to as sess potential ex posures and medical outcomes for U.S. military personnel who participated in Operation Desert Storm. Once troop locations are determined and mapped (from the Troop Locati on Registry data), the GIS can help determine potential troop exposure to any number of different chemicals, env ironmental threats, or other materials. When troop locations and potential exposures have been de termined, the potential health risks resulting from the potential exposures can be determined. In addition to examining potential exposure, databases on medical outcomes (e.g., Comprehe nsive Clinical Evaluation Program (CCEP), the Veterans Administration Mortality Study, etc.) can be evaluated by study ing potential exposures, locations, movements, and relationships of t he troops in these databases for epidemiological significance. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES) : Characterization of the potential exposures and health risks/outcomes associated with service by U.S. military person nel in Operation Desert Storm. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Ongoing. As of J anuary 1998, several environmental, toxicological, epidemiological, and demographic / unit movement databases have been entered into the TEAM system. The environmental data sets include daily satellite images and modeled oil fires superplume boundaries; exposure factors; Kuwaiti crude oil comp ositions; pollutant specific emission factors; modeled plume boundaries from the Khamisiyah Pit Demolition; and locations of suspected Iraqi CW/BW sites. The toxicological data include the IRIS and HEAST databa ses produced by the EPA and pertinent exposure factors data published by the U. S. Army and the EPA. The DODs Comprehensive Clinical Evaluation Program (CCEP) database along with limited unit identification code data from the VA comprises the TEAM epidemiologic database. The epidemiologic database has been used to support medical outcome studies for the Khamisiyah Case Narrative published by the OSAGWI. The demographic / troop unit move ment databases include the Defense Manpower Data Center's ODS personnel roster and the U.S. Armed Services Center for Research of Unit Records (CRUR) daily unit movements and locations. The CHPPM is continuing to work with DoD agencies and research groups investigating Gulf War Illnesses.

Completion (CY): 1995 OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: To devise a proc edure for counting the collections of symptoms and diagnoses of veterans' illnesses and relating them to the U.S. military grid system locations in the Kuwait-Iraq-Saudi Arabian theater of operations. SPECIFIC AIMS: To identify the geographic location s by date of the Army personnel who served in the Gulf War and whose names are recorded in the VA register as experiencing severe health problems. The units to which these personnel we re assigned are tracked across the Iraq-Kuwait region, in order to determine whether epidem iological commonalities can be detected based upon location at certain dates. METHODOLOGY: VA malady codes of afflicted pers onnel related to unit identification codes were identified. Malady information was regrouped and coded into crisp and fuzzy numbers. For the Part 1, only crisp numbered malady information was used. The DOD Register was used to identify geographic coordinate locations of Army units. A mathematical algorithm was developed to compare geographic location to maladies and possible cause(s) of each of the maladies. The algorithm is based on the ratios of the number of combatants r eporting illnesses (in any grid) to the total number of combatants (occupying the gr id) as discrete prob abilities. These are considered to be the probabilities of occurrence of a health condition for the total time period that a military unit occupies a grid. A production model needs to be completed to compute statistical measures that are concerned with Gulf War veterans' illnesses. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): A mathematical procedure to count the collections of symptoms and diagnoses over t he various map grids of the region. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Completed.

Persian Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Research Database - Project No DoD-21 Title: Study of Variability In Pyridostigmin e Inhibition of Blood Cholinesterases in Healthy Adults and Individuals With Symptoms Followi ng Participation in Operation Desert Storm Project #: DoD-21 Agency: DoD Study Location: WRAIR, Wash. Completion (CY): 1997 Prevention OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Assess individual differences in blood cholinesterase regulation and response to pyridostigmine. SPECIFIC AIMS: Determine if individuals have di fferent sensitivities to inhibition of blood cholinesterases by pyridostigmine and/or differenc es in the rate of spontaneous reactivation of cholinesterases after pyridostigmine exposure. Determine if there is a difference in the cholinesterases of Gulf War veterans who took pyridostigmine and seen at the Gulf War Health Center compared to age and sex matched controls. METHODOLOGY: Blood (in EDTA) is obtained from Gulf War veterans seen at the Gulf War Health Center at Walter Reed Army Medical Cent er and from age and sex matched controls. Blood samples were assigned code numbers when drawn in the Gulf War Health Center, and the code was broken for the first 40 samples only after results from the data analysis were complete. Estimated spontaneous reactivation times after in vitro pyridostigmine inhibition, red cell acetylcholinesterase activity, and plasma butyrylcholinesterase activity were compared in blood samples from 20 veterans of Operation Desert Storm and 20 control subjec ts, matched for sex and age. Determination of plasma butyrylcholinesterase phenotypes was done at the Eppley Institute, University of Nebraska, Omaha, NE. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): Complete initial studies of the first 40 volunteers by FY96; and from 100 volunteers by FY97. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: In the inital study of 40 volunteers, 18 of the 20 veterans in the study (90%) presented to the WRAMC Comprehensive Clinical Evaluation Program with post-war symptoms. All Gulf War veterans indicated they had taken pyridostigmine as a pretreatment drug for nerve agent exposure; 15 of 20 recalled having side effects after taking pyridostigmine. Mean red cell lysate acetylcholinesterase for all subjects was 5.7 U/ml +/- 0.7; mean plasma butyrylcholinesterase was ontaneous reactivation time (t-1/2 at pyridostigmine) for all subjects was 42.6 min +/-5 .4; mean for veterans was 43.2 +/- 6.2; mean for controls was 42.1 min +/- 4.6. Statistical analysis of reactivation times (repeated measures ANOVA) revealed no statistically significant differences be tween controls and veterans. However, significant differences in reactivation times (p=0.01) were observed between males and females across both groups. Differences in cholinesterase activities between controls and veterans were not statistically significant, but a differences between sexes was agai n significantly different. The occurrence of the UU (homozygous, usual, wild type) and UA (heter ozygous, usual, phenotypes of butylcholineserase in this study population [95% ( 38 of 40) and 5% (2 of 40), respectively] is close to the expected frequency, 96% and 4%. All Gulf War veterans in the study had the homozygous, usual, wild-type (UU) allele. Symptoms exhibited by these indivi duals do not appear to be related to either altered ability of red cell acetylcholineste rase to be inhibited by pyridostigmine, to extended spontaneous reactivation time after pyridostig mine exposure, or to a genetic mutation in the butyrylcholinesterase phenotype. In the study of the remaining 60 volunteers, another 40 samples have been collected to date. The coding of these samples will not be examined until the remaining 20 blood samples have been analyzed.

Persian Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Research Database - Project No DoD-22 Title: Chronic Organophosphorus Exposure Res Inst., Augusta Project Status: Ongoing Research Type: Basic Research P.I.: Jerry J. Buccafusco, Research Focus: Environmental Toxicology Start Date (CY): 1995 Est. Completion (CY): 1998 Brain & Nervous System Chemical Weapons OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the effe cts of low-level sub-chronic exposure to an organophosphorus cholinesterase inhibitor on normal cognitive function in animal models. The long term goals are to identify the underlying me chanisms of organic brain damage related to environmental toxins and to develop novel treatm ent strategies to improve memory/cognitive performance in affected patients. SPECIFIC AIMS: This study will address four main questions: 1. Does low-level sub-chronic exposure to an organosphorus (OP) cholinesterase inhibitor produce learning or memory deficits in rats and non-human primates trained to perform various memory tasks; and will prior exposure to atropine sensitize animals to OP agents? 2. Is memory impairment to an OP agent associated with alterations in the presynaptic regulation of cho linergic neurons in relevant brain regions in rats; and/or is there an alteration in the ability of t he brain adrenergic system to regulate presynaptic cholinergic function? 3. Is memory impairment to an OP agent associated with alterations in the postsynaptic regulation of cholinergic or adrenergic receptors? Can these alterations be reflected in the genes encoding the various muscarinic or ni cotinic receptor subtypes? 4. Can new therapies (reversible cholinesterase inhibitors, nicotinic agonists, adrenergic agonists) which improve memory deficits in Alzheimer's patients also improve cogni tive function in rats or monkeys with OP-induced memory impairment? METHODOLOGY: Protocol 1: Three groups of 12 rats each are administered 0.25, 0.5, or 1.0 mg/kg of DFP once daily over 2 weeks. The st atus of brain muscarinic receptors and blood cholinesterase is determined and 2 days after the last dose of DFP they will be examined for performance in the Morris water maze. Monkeys will be well-trained in the delayed matching-to-sample (DMTS) task. The highest do se of diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) which does not elicit overt signs of anticholinesterase toxici ty or which will not decrease DMTS performance will be employed in the study. Protocol 2: Rats ar e administered a 14-day DFP regimen. Samples of regional brain tissue are taken on 4 occasions duri ng treatment from randomly selected rats (6 per time point) to determine the status of choline acetyl transferase (ChA T) activity and for the estimation of ACh turnover rates. We exami ne the ability of clonidine to inhibit presynaptic cholinergic function using biochemical techniques. Finally, these experiments are repeated in rats subjected to atropine sensitization. Protocol 3: Rats are administered a 14-day DFP regimen. Samples of regional brain tissue are taken on four occasions during treatment to determine the status of muscarinic, nicotinic, and alpha-adregenic receptor subtypes in several brain regions using quantitative receptor autoradiog raphy. Small samples of tissue are removed for quantitative RT-PCR. Protocol 4: The monk eys which have been evaluated in Protocol 1 for production of long-term decrements in DMTS performance are employed. They receive increasing doses of drugs designed to enhance cogn itive performance. The experiments occur concomitantly with a similar series performed in rats tested using the Morris water maze. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES) : This research will elucidate mechanisms of permanent memory dysfunction produced by exposure to a relevant organophosphorus agent DFP in non-human primate and rat models. Also, the effe cts of reversing this memory impairment using classical and novel age nts developed for patients with Alzheimer's disease will be evaluated. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Chronic, low-level ex posure to acetylcholinesterase (Ache) inhibitor organophosphate (OP) insecticides or chemic al warfare agents produces abnormalities in CNS acetylcholine (ACh) function, and in humans, may be associated with impaired cognitive function well after withdrawal form such exposure. The purpose of the present study is to identify the severity of impairment in spatial learning of rats and monkeys following protracted withdrawal from chronic, low-level exposure to the OP agent DFP. Assessme nt of spatial learning began either 3 or 17 days after completion of a 14 day DFP treatment regimen (50, 250, or 500 mg/kg). During the 14 day treatment regimen, prior to wi thdrawal, spontaneous activity and ol factory behaviors were initially suppressed during DFP exposure, effects which became tolerant with repeated exposure to the 250 mg/kg dose regimen. Performance of a standar d water maze task was impaired for up to 21 days after withdrawal from treatment with a 250 mg/kg dose of DFP. Latencies to find a hidden platform were increased by 30-40% above control levels th roughout testing and no overt signs of DFP toxicity were evident. All animals did, however, demonstrate the ability to eventually learn the task. AChE activity in the frontal cortex and hippocampus was suppressed to 41% and 51% of control levels, respectively, after 14 days of DFP (250 mg/kg) treatment. By 7 days after withdrawal from treatment, frontal cortex AChE activity had recove red to 84% of control levels, whereas hippocampal AChE activity had recovered to only 64.40%. By 21 days after withdrawal from treatment, AChE in both brain regions had recovered to near-control le vels. Performance of a previously well-learned delayed matching task by monkeys was not affected by DFP regimens after withdrawal of the drug. Chronic, low-level OP exposure, therefore, produces protracted impa irment of working memory after drug withdrawal that is not associated with contin ued suppression of AChE activity. This impairment may be attributed to the decrease in recovery of AChE in the hippocampus, relative to the cortex. This decreased rate of enzyme recovery may contribute to hippocampal toxicity underlying protracted impairment of working memory. In 3 rhesus monkeys, well trained in the performance of a delayed response task, chronic daily exposure to 10-20 mg/kg of DFP produced severe toxicity and task impairment after 8 weeks of treatment. However, task performance was at near control levels by 6-10 days after DFP withdrawal. Withdrawal fr om chronic exposure to low levels of DFP may compromise working memory or learning of a new task, but fails to inhibit the performance of a well learned task if no toxicity is present.

DC Project Status: Ongoing Research Type: Epidemiology Research P.I.: MAJ John Stuart Research Focus: Brain & Nervous System Start Date (CY): 1993 Est. Completion (CY): 1998 Symptoms/General Health OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Determine the acute and long-term impact of deployment to SWA on the physical and mental health of soldiers and their families. SPECIFIC AIMS: Determine the ac ute and long-term impact of deployment to SWA on the physical and mental health of soldiers organizational, and environmental factors within military units that produce psychiatric casualties. Ident ify the critical indicators result ing in increased risk and assess the long-term consequences of exposure to tr auma. Develop recommendations on post-deployment interventions. Determine impacts of Army fam ily support policies and programs on active duty and reserve component soldiers and their families. METHODOLOGY: Interviews and surveys of sold iers and leaders participating in ODS were conducted several times prior to the ground war, immediately after the ground war, and at intervals following return home. Soldiers and their spouses were surveyed and interviewed in order to evaluate the social, psychological, organizational, and environmental fa ctors within military units that produce psychiatric casualties, lead to dysf unctional behavior and decrements in military performance, generate psychomatic illness and in creased susceptibility to physical illness. The family-community research team performed field surveys of spouses of active duty and reserve component (USAR) and (ARNG) soldiers from uni ts deployed to the Persian Gulf for ODS on deployment-related stressors and psychological symp toms, spouse support-seeking behavior, family perceptions of Army support and assistance, stress-coping responses, and family well-being during reunion with returning soldiers and in the aftermath of ODS. Surveys and interviews of selected Reserve and National Guard units and their families have been conduct ed during the period following ODS, while additional interviews and surveys were conducted with soldiers and families participating in Operation Just Cause and Sinai peacekeeping deployments. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTON ES): Develop recommendations affecting post-combat interventions. Determine the impact of Army family support policies and programs on both active duty and research component soldiers and families. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: An assessment of p sychological factors rela ted to deployment stress and family separation during Operation Desert Sh ield/Storm was conducted with a stratified sample of married and single U.S. Army Individual Ready Reserve soldiers two years post ODS. Analyses were performed in 1994 with final report comple ted in spring of 1995 and submitted to Army Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel. Deployment stre ss and adaptation was studied on a large sample of U.S. Army National Guard and U.S. Army Reserv e Unit soldiers who activated and deployed for Operation Desert Shield/Storm. Physiological st ress, distress, coping and factors related to current deployed effects of family separation were asse ssed. Physiological well-being was studied with respect to deployment location factors. Persian Gu lf Region analyses were performed in summer of 1995 and resulted in a manuscript on the long term effects of Desert Storm on the Army Reserve and National Guard soldiers and their families.

Completion (CY): 1999 Symptoms/General Health OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Test the hypothesi s that Gulf War veterans who report persistent unexplained symptoms do not represent a discrete illness but instead fall within a continuum of stress-related syndromes commonly seen in the general U.S. population, including fibromyalgia (FM), chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS), and somatoform disorder (SD). SPECIFIC AIMS: Specific hypothese s to be tested include: (1) Gulf War veterans with unexplained symptoms display centrally mediated disturbances in autonomic tone, and this leads to vasomotor instability and smooth muscle dysmotility, and symp toms such as irritable bowel syndromes and migraine headaches, (2) these same individuals display diffuse disturbances in nociception (pain threshold) that are partly responsible for many of the pain-related symptoms seen in this condition such as muscle and joint pain and persistent sore throat,(3) the same neuroendocrine changes seen in FM, CFS, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) which are characterized by blunted responses in the hypothalamic-pitui tary axis, are seen in these Gulf War veterans and may also be associated with fatigue symptoms. METHODS: This study is a collaborative effort between Georgetown University Medical Center and the Washington D.C. Veterans Administrati on Medical Center (VAMC). The results of neurophysiological and neuropsychological testing wi ll be compared between a group of Gulf War veterans and a group of individuals with FM/CFS. Participants are admitted to the Clinical Research Center at Georgetown for two days following t heir routine admission to the VAMC, and undergo a series of studies to evaluate physiologic and bi ochemical parameters. The physiologic studies measure qualitative and quantitative aspects of symptoms, including specialized testing of peripheral and visceral nociception, and smooth muscle motilit y. Biochemical analyses include evaluation of multiple indices of autonomic function, incl uding neurohormone levels at baseline and after standardized stressors, and cerebral spinal fluid levels of neurotransmitters. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): A be tter understanding of common underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms in fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, multiple chemical sensitivity and the undiagnosed illnesses of Gulf Wa r veterans should lead to both more effective treatment of Gulf War veterans and produce effect ive strategies to avoid these problems in future deployments. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Six Gulf War vetera ns have been studied; nearly all of the comparison group patients with FM/CFS and healthy normal cont rols have been recruited and the data analyzed. These data reveal differences between patients a nd controls, which indicates that the hypotheses about Gulf War veterans will be testable. Recent efforts have been undertaken to enhance subject recruitment, such as more frequent communicati on with the VAMC and attempts to accommodate the Gulf War veteran patients during their off-days from the VAMC. Subject recruitment has fallen short of the original plan but the investigators are hopef ul that their intensified recruitment efforts will increase subject recruitment in the second year of the study. Sample size is still too small to report any preliminary results.

Completion (CY): 1999 Diagnosis OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the neuropsychological functioning of Persian Gulf War (PGW)-era veterans who are seeking treatment or diagnostic evaluation for any type of health or adjustment complaint. The group of patients w ho were deployed to the Gulf are being compared to a treatment seeking patient group who were not depl oyed to the Gulf. Data from these groups are also being compared with those from a (non-treatment seeking) research sample of PGW veterans who are being studied using the same neuropsychological instruments. In addition, all of these patients and research subjects are being administered a standardized set of questionnaires and semi-structured interviews that will identify t heir current health symptoms, pre-existing physical and mental health condition, sociodemographic variables, Gulf experiences, and Post PGW-era stressors. These instruments also permit post-trau matic stress disorder (P TSD), multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS), chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), and other psyc hiatric disorders to be diagnosed. SPECIFIC AIMS: The specific aim of this study is to determine whether vetera ns of the Persian Gulf War (PGW) show cognitive impairments suggestive of central nervous syst em damage at a greater rate than PGW-era veterans who were not deployed to the Gulf. METHODOLOGY: Two hundred subjects will be exam ined in three years; 100 veterans deployed to the Gulf during the PGW and 100 serving in the milit ary during that era who were not deployed to the Gulf. These subjects will be recruited from amon g those seeking treatment or diagnostic evaluation at the Boston VAMC through all outpatient treatment services. It is anticipated that approximately 40 subjects in each group will be recruited in each of years 1 and 2, and 20 in each group in year 3 of the proposed period of support. The recruitment procedure has been fully outlined. It has been devised to reduce selection bias that woul d reduce the comparability of Gulf-deployed and non-deployed veterans. a. Subjects. All treatment seeking veterans disc harged from the military since the beginning of the PGW will be considered potentia l subjects. A list of veterans who have been admitted to any outpatient clinical service (with the exclusion of the substance abuse clinic) at the Boston VAMC in Jamaica Plain, the outpatient clinic at Caus eway Street, and the Lowell VAMC will be generated by the supervisor of outpatient clinics and will be updated periodically. This list will include names, social security numbers, and telephone numbers (where available) or addresses (if telephone numbers are not available). As a preliminary st ep, the lists will be cross-checked with the Persian Gulf War Registry to determine the approximate proportions of the PGW veterans and non-deployed PGW-era veterans available. However, the person nel involved in the recruitment of subjects will not be aware of the status of potential subjects with regard to deployment to the Gulf and steps will be taken to reduce the likelihood that this information will become known to project staff during the recruitment process. b. Initial Contact. The first contact with potential subjects will be by telephone (or by mail, if there is no telephone number available). At the beginning of this contact, subjects w ill be requested to not indicate whether or not they served in the Gulf. They will be told that, if they should decide to participate in the research project, information concerning deployment will be obtained at a later time. The initial contact will consist of a descr iption of the project, including types of assessment, time required, and financial compensation. Subjects will have an opportunity to ask questions about the procedure. They will be informed that whethe r or not they participate will have no bearing on their medical care and that, if they choose to partici pate, that they may withdraw at any time without prejudice. They will be asked to i ndicate whether they wish to participate, wish not to participate, or wish to defer this decision. An appointment at the Boston VAMC will be scheduled for patients agreeing to participate. c. Methods. Patients will first be seen for a brie f screening interview and patients retained in the study sample will be presented the study consent form for signature. Subjects will complete a battery of neuropsychological tests, a set of question naires, and 2 semi-structured interviews (one will encompass their current health and past environmen tal exposure history; the other will be done to determine psychiatric and/or PTSD diagnoses). EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): To isolate factors that may differentiate those who served in the Gulf who are seeking treatment for health complaints from their treatment-seeking counterparts who were not deployed to the Gulf. This is a step toward understanding the Gulf War Syndrome. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Recruitment for this study is fully underway. To date, over 100 subjects have participated in the study. We expect to complete data collection in the Summer of 1998. Data entry and management are on-going.

NC, Chapel Hill Project Status: Ongoing Research 1998 Prevention OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Test the hypot hesis that a genetically based cholinergic supersensitivity might underlie the increased sensit ivity of vulnerable human populations, similar to the condition labeled Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS). SPECIFIC AIMS: Determine strain-dependent effects of acute and administered pyridostigmine. Determine whet her chronic py ridostigmine will protect ago nists effects of other anticholinesterase agents. This will be accomplished by developing an animal model with cholinergic supersensitivity which is also more sensitive to a variety of drugs and other chemical agents. METHODOLOGY: Rats will be treated with pyrido stigmine acutely or chronically and growth hormone, body temperature and locomotor activity will be assessed. The Flinders Line rats developed at Flinders University in Australia by selective breeding for differential responses to the anticholinesterase, diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP). These rats have been shown to be more sensitive to directly acting muscarinic agonists, as well as a variety of other drugs including alcohol, diazepam, and nicotine. The heightened sensitivity of this special line of rats to a variety of drugs suggests that they will also be more sensitive to the effects of pyridostigmi ne, an anticholinesterase drug which was given to soldiers during ODS. EXPECTED PRODUCTS/MILESTONES: Ultimately, this may lead to the development of challenge test to predict cholinergic sensitivity in soldiers. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: The results of initial experiments indicate that there are no line differences in telemetrically monitored hypothermia or general activity after pyridostigmine (4, 12, or 36 mg/kg, orally administered), even though ther e were substantial differences in hypothermia induced by the muscarinic agonist, oxotremorine. These negative findings were expected because pyridostigmine does not exert central cholinergi c effects necessary to induce these changes. Growth hormone concentrations, the parameter most likely to change after pyridostigmine treatment, is still being analyzed. PUBLICATIONS: Overstreet DH, Rezvani AH, Yang Y, Hamedi H, Janowsky DS.

Comp letion (CY): 1998 Interactions OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Estimate the expos ure to in-tent pollutants during the Gulf War deployment by simulation of human exposure to aer osols in unvented tents heated by leaded diesel fuel. SPECIFIC AIMS: Perform physical and chemical ch aracterization of aerosol s produced by heaters that burned leaded diesel fuel in an unvented tent, and estimate exposure to lead, combustion gases (such as CO2, CO, NOx, and SO2), and organic compounds (such as PAHs). METHODOLOGY: Using Army tents and heaters, fo ur heaters will be evaluated for variability. Aerosols and vapors will be characterized physically and chemically using a Tenax sampler (vapors), the Lovelace Multi-jet Cascade Impactor/Parallel Fl ow Diffusion Batter (aerosol size distribution, concentration, and chemical composition vs. parti cle sizes), an electrostatic precipitator sampler (particle morphology), and filter samples (aerosol concentration). These samples will provide chemical compositions, lead content, time-averag ed aerosol size distribution, and concentration. Real-time aerosol size distribution and concentra tion as a function of time will be obtained using a Quartz Crystal Microbalance or a Differential Mobility Particle Sizer. EXPECTED PRODUCTS/MILESTONES: Th is research will provide deta iled information on pollutants produced in unvented tents from heaters that burn leaded diesel fuels. This information is needed to assess potential exposure of service personnel who served in the Persian Gulf War. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: The investigators performed an extensive review of the appropriate materiel (tents, heaters, and fuels) in order to provide the most accurate simulation of conditions present during the Gulf War, including extensive communications with materiel developers at Natick and Fort Belvoir. An Army GP-medium tent and several tent heaters and fuels have been obtained. Several studies have been conducted using SF-6 trace gas methods to determine critical study parameters including the air exchange rate of t he tent and the tent volume. The experimental protocol has been approved and preparations are underway for gas analyses.

Completion (CY): 1998 OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Conduct a feasibility study to deter mine if Reserve participants in the Persian Gulf War can be linked to vital statistics and Birth Defects Registry data. SPECIFIC AIMS: Determine if DoD computerized info rmation is accurate compared to the hospital medical records and determi ne the feasibility of investigating birth defects in the children of Gulf War veterans. METHODOLOGY: Information will be obtained from DOD on all children born to active duty Gulf War veterans posted to or stationed in California between May 1991 and May 1994. From this, a random sample of 500 births per year between 1991 and 1 994 (approximately 20% of births to active duty military personnel) will be drawn and an attempt will be made to locate their hospital medical records. All records will be reviewed and abstracted for data on congenital abnormalities using criteria established by the California Birth Defects Monitoring Program (CBDMP). This information will be compared to current DOD computerized information a bout offspring of active Gulf War veterans. An additional objective will be to link California birth certificates and CBDMP files. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): The review of an estimated total 1500 birth records is expected to yield 2.8% or 42 cases with structural congenital abnormalities. This number will be adequate to quantitatively estimate the concur rence with DOD computerized information on congenital abnormalities. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: The investigators hav e just received approval from the Army Human Subjects Research Review Board, permitting t hem to begin the study after a protracted negotiation concerning patient confidentiality concerns.

Haller, M.D. Research Focus: Brain & Nervous System Start Date (CY): 1996 Est. Completion (CY): 1998 Symptoms/General Health OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Test the hypothesis that mechanisms used by muscle cells to use oxygen and produce energy for work may be impaired in patients suffering abnormal muscle fatigue and the inability to exercise. SPECIFIC AIMS: On the basis of preliminary results of evaluation of symptoms of abnormal fatigability in Gulf War veterans, the research ers hypothesize that the common complaint of abnormal fatigue and exercise intolerance in these patients is attributable to impaired energy production via oxidative phosphorylation. Under this general hypothesis, the researcher will address four specific question: (1) Is there an abnormality in muscle oxygen utilization or oxygen transport to muscle during exercise in affected individuals? (2 ) Is there exaggerated metabolic muscle fatigue in exercise consistent with impaired energy production? (3) Is the metabolic and physiologic response to aerobic physical conditioning impaired in thes e patients? (4) Is there a specific pattern of impaired activities of mitochondrial oxidative enzym es or respiratory chain complexes to account for impaired oxidative metabolism on attenuated increases in oxidative capacity in response to physical training. METHODOLOGY: Exercise protocols and non-invasiv e monitors of oxygen transport and utilization as well as detailed muscle biochemistry will be used to identify specific causes of exercise intolerance in patients. The investigators will employ forearm and cycle exercise to determine maximal work and oxidative capacity and to compare fatigue and metabolic responses to similar workloads among patients and age- and weight-matched sedentary co ntrol subjects. The study will compare muscle metabolic and physiologic responses to aerobic training in patients and matched control subjects. The oxidative mechanism in blood will be monitored by measurements of blood levels of diffusible metabolites that reflect oxidative capacity; magnetic resonance spectros copy; and by using infrared spectroscopy. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES) : This study will evaluate t he hypothesis t hat oxidative limitations detected with non-invasive testing are attributable to impaired function of the mitochondrial respiratory chain as assessed biochemically in biopsied muscle.

Completion (CY): 1999 Pyridostigmine Bromide Brain & Nervous System OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Determine if neurobehavioral toxicity and immune response alterations are produced by small doses of medical pretreatments and insecticides, alone or in combination, in male and female rats. SPECIFIC AIMS: This study will te st the hypothesis that administration of pyridostigmine bromide (PB), permethrin (PERM) and DEET as single agents, or in combination, results in neurobehavioral toxicity and an altered immune response. It will also test the hypothesis that females are significantly more sensitive to the e ffects of these agents than are males. METHODOLOGY: Chemical analys es will determine (1) the meta bolism and elimination of PB, permethrin and DEET, alone and in combination, for male and female subjects who participated in the neurobehavioral experiments, and (2) how PB, permethrin and DEET, alone and in combination, affect cholinesterase activity in these same subjects. This inform ation will allow the correlation of plasma concentrations of PB, permethrin and DEET with the behavioral observations. Experiments have been designed to measure various aspects of CNS functioning in the presence of sub-toxic doses of PB, PERM, and DEET in adult male and fe male rats. Doses for PB will be 3/10/30 mg/kg, concentrations of PB, PERM, and DEET will be determined and their effects on cholinesterase activity will be correlated with CNS functioning. The neurobehavioral analyses will be complemented by an assessment of the immune response in the same subjects, as well as in lymphocytes from health human volunteers. The immunological exper iments will be conducted to determine the role of PB, permethrin and DEET and (1) Suppression of the first and second signal transduction pathways in T-lymphocytes, (2) Cytokine expression, and (3 ) B-lymphocyte function. The neurobehavioral test battery is designed to measure critical aspe cts of CNS functioning related to symptoms of generalized fatigue, gastro-intestinal disturbance, muscle and joint pain, headaches, and memory loss. The neurobehavioral test battery includes an assessment of spontaneous locomotor behavior and an analysis of overall CNS functioning, motivation and memory performance. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES) : This study extends obse rvations from previous experiments in male rats exposed to toxic doses of pyridostigmine or permethrin to female rats and to the effects of PB, permethrin and/or DEET in combination. This study will also provide additional information on the motivational and memory aspects of CNS functioning. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: none reported.

Completion (CY): 1998 Diagnosis OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Develop a sensit ive method to detect infection with Leishmania tropica, or related species, in military personnel. SPECIFIC AIMS: There are currently no defined antig ens for use in the diagnosis of leishmaniasis. There is an urgent need for sensitive methods to detect infection with Leishmania tropica, or related species, in military personnel. The researchers have developed such tests for other Leishmania species, and have isolated and characterized L. tropica antigens reactive with sera from L. tropica infected Gulf War veterans. This study will attemp t to develop similar tests for L. tropica using these recombinant L. tropica antigens. Effort will also be directed at cloning additional L. tropica antigens reactive with L. tropica infection sera and antigens stimulate T-cells from individuals with L. tropica infection. METHODOLOGY: Emphasis will be given to expressed genes which are highly sensitive. Inserts will be sequenced for determination of epitopes whic h may be produced synthetically. Recombinant or synthetic peptides will be evaluated by ELISA for t heir ability to detect antibody in patient sera. In related studies, cloned gene products will be evaluated for their ability to elicit patient T-cell response in vitro. These evaluations will include proliferation and cytokine production. Emphasi s will be placed on finding antigens which are shared between Leishmania species having the ability to elicit strong T-cell responses. Such antigens will be candidates for skin test antigens and vaccine production. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Several new peptid es of Lt-1 antigen have been made and evaluated them as serological reagents. Also, screening of L.tropica genomic libraries for new antigens have begun.

Completion (CY): 1999 OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Assess the prevalence of unexplained illnesses, including chronic fatigue-like symptoms, in members of the United Kingdom Armed Forces who were deployed to the Persian Gulf during the Gulf War and who have served, and are serving in Bosnia. SPECIFIC AIMS: This study is a two stage cohort study. Stage 1 consists of a postal health screening questionnaire to be sent to three grou ps who were/are in the Armed Forces; those who served in the Persian Gulf, those who served in Bosnia, and those who served in neither the Persian Gulf or Bosnia. The second stage involves performing neurophsychological tests on cases identified by stage 1 and a control group. METHODOLOGY: This epidemiological study of t he prevalence of unexplained illnesses in the populations at risk will use a two-stage design. St age 1 will be a questionnaire survey of 3000 Gulf War veterans selected at random, an equivalent samp le of Bosnia veterans, and appropriate control groups for each. Stage II will involve interview, examination, and testing of all those (approximately 10%) in Stage I who fall above a cutoff defining s ubjective health. Information gathered at Stage II will be used to estimate the prevalence of diagnosed and unexplained morbidity, including chronic fatigue symptoms, in UK service personnel, and to ca lculate whether there is an excess associated with Gulf War and/or Bosnia service. If ther e is, then the researchers will be able to examine pre-morbid and psychosocial factors which may be implicated in such an increase, as well as identify avenues for further biological and psychosocial research. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): Reports and publications. This epidemiological study should ascertain if service in the Gulf War by UK armed forces personnel was associated with an increase in physical and/or psychological morbidity, and if so, if there is evidence of an increase in either new or ill-defined conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome, or an illness peculiar to Gulf War service. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: The questionnaire has been devised and a detailed pilot study has been undertaken, with resulting revisions to the questionnaire. The main body of the study is currently in progress with 12,750 questionnaires being sent to currently serving and ex military personnel. Tracing procedures have been extensiv ely investigated and algorithms devised. This research effort is currently being coordinated with a new initiative by the British government (since this grant was awarded) to ensure that all UK research into Gulf War Illnesses proceeds in an integrated fashion.

Completion (CY): 2001 Symptoms/General Health OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Determine the natu re of memory for traumatic events as they relate to PTSD symptoms. SPECIFIC AIMS: To examine the course of memo ry for traumatic events over time and the brain areas believed to be altered due to trauma. METHODOLOGY: Longitudinal follow-up of a cohort of veterans of Operation Desert Storm (e.g. questionnaires, ratings scales). MRI study of 30 De sert Storm veterans with PTSD. This research will continue to follow the course of symptoms of Post -Traumatic Stress Disorder in a population of Gulf War veterans. This study of how such symptoms, as well as memory function, change over time in the veterans will lead to a better understanding of PTSD and the elements of risk that would cause and continue PTSD symptoms over time. The study is in two parts. The first part is a longitudinal descriptive study of trauma-related symptomatology in Gulf War veterans. The second part is an investigation of memory function and hippocampal vo lume in Gulf War veterans who meet criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Results of the researchers' previous work with a cohort of Gulf War veterans indicated that there was an overall increase in PTSD symptomatology in the veterans over the first two years following the Gulf War. With regard to memory testing, there were many instances of inconsistent recall for events t hat were objective and highly traumatic in nature. The data do not support the position that traumatic memories are fixed or indelible and suggest that as PTSD symptomatology increases, so does amp lification of memory for traumatic events. This study continues the original methodology for the fifth, sixth and seventh post-war years. It is anticipated that a high percentage of subjects who ha ve already participated in this research can be recruited to continue in this project and that at least 100 new subjects can also be recruited. It is anticipated that a better understanding of the longit udinal course of trauma-related symptomatology and risk factors for the development and maintenance of these symptoms would have implications for treatment. The second part of the study will examine the possibilit y that memory deficits in the subject population are relatively broad-based and re flect problems at several levels of information processing, including acquisition, retention and/ or retrieval and that these memory deficits may be related to decreased hippocampal volume. Results of this study would make it possible to determine whether these abnormalities are present in a va riety of combat populations and whether such abnormalities can be detected at earlier stages t han in the previously-studied Vietnam veteran population. Potential relationship to clinical sy mptomatology and psychosocial functioning will also be investigated. EXPECTED PRODUCTS/MILESTONES: The investigators expect to show that memory for traumatic events is not consistent over time, and that there may be associated decrease in hippocampal volume in PTSD.

Date (CY): 1996 Est. Completion (CY): 1999 Symptoms/General Health OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Investigate the etiology of ongoing chronic fatigue and muscle weakness in Gulf War veterans with unexplained illnesses by evaluating abnormalities in skeletal muscle function. SPECIFIC AIMS: Evaluate skeletal mu scle in Persian Gulf veterans with severe chronic fatigue and Persian Gulf veterans with no medical complaints (healthy controls); determine the relationship between the severity of chronic fatigue in Persian Gulf veterans and the degree of muscle dysfunction; and compare muscle function in Persian Gulf veterans with severe chronic fatigue with muscle function in healthy sedentary civilians and civilians with chronic fatigue. METHODOLOGY: The goal of this proposal is to evaluate skeletal muscle in Persian Gulf veterans. Our major hypothesis is that Persian Gulf veter ans who present a symptom profile consistent with chronic fatigue suffer from muscle dysfunctioning. In addition, we hypothesize that the severity of chronic fatigue in this population is related to the degree of muscle dysfunctioning. To test these hypotheses, a battery of tests will be performed on Persian Gulf veterans with severe chronic fatigue (n=50) and on Persian Gulf veterans who were deployed but who have no medical problems (n=50). The evaluation will consist of the following measur ements: 1. Functional assessment as reflected in isometric and isokinetic measures; 2. In vivo metabolic measures Resonance spectroscopy (MRS); 3. In vivo mo rphological measures as determined via Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI); 4. Histological analyses of muscle biopsies; 5. Electromyographic evaluation of motor unit recruitment; 6. Muscle enzyme levels; 7. Genetic screening. EXPECTED PROJECTS (MILESTONES): This project ru ns over three years. The first 6 months serve to recruit the subjects and to train the necessary personnel. The following two years will be used to collect all the data at a rate of approxim ately 1 subject/week (at the end of the first year 13 Persian Gulf veterans with chronic fatigue and 13 healthy veterans will have been tested). At the end of the second year, 24 more subjects with chronic fatigue and 24 healthy controls will have been tested. For the first 6 months of the third y ear the final 13 veterans with chronic fatigue and 13 controls will be tested. Data collection will be co mpleted at the end of 2.5 years. The final 6 months of this 3 year period will be used to analyze and interpret the data. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: In the process of acquiring data.

Completion (CY): 2000 Immunology Brain & Nervous System OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Determine if there are fundamental neuropsychiatric or immunologic abnormalities in Gulf War veterans wh ich might be associated in a case control study with their service in the Gulf. SPECIFIC AIMS: The specific goals of this proposa l are to: 1) evaluate self-reported conditions in Persian Gulf veterans to determine if they represent described and accepted medical conditions and/or are associated with objective findings wh ich would validate these symptoms; 2) evaluate symptomatic Gulf war veterans to determine risk factors which may identify veterans who have reported symptoms; and, 3) evaluate in a controll ed fashion symptomatic, but undiagnosed, Persian Gulf war veterans to determine if there is a def inable immunologic or neuro-psychiatric abnormality. METHODOLOGY: This study will determine whether specific immunological or neuropsychiatric abnormalities can be detected in GW participants who are symptomatic, but in whom no specific diagnosis has as yet been made. These studies may uncover an immunological basis for some of the broad types of symptoms reported by GW veterans . This proposal attempts to get at the heart of the problem cited in the Institute of Medicine (I OM) report, that GW veterans' mystery illnesses may not be a single illness and that it is important to study various possible causes and the interactions between causes. The Birmingham VAMC has been very active in evaluating patients returning from the Persian Gulf war. Approximately 1400 individuals have been seen and have had evaluations. Of these, about 10-15% are asymptomatic. Of the remaining 85%, approximately 90% have a diagnosable illness. A number of Persian Gulf ve terans, which are conservatively estimated as 100 of those seen at the BVAMC, are symptomatic and do not have defined illn esses. The use of advanced methodology in the imaging, immune, mycoplasma and oxidant injury study is important. Sample sizes are adequate and support for statistical analysis is an integral part of the proposal. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES) : Reports and publications. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: None reported.

Completion (CY): 1999 Symptoms/General Health Immunology OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this project is to investigate Persian Gulf War (PGW) veterans and their sexual partner(s) who are experiencing a burning sensation after contact with semen since returning from the Persian Gulf. SPECIFIC AIMS: Military and veteran sources will be surveyed to obtain a population of women who developed vaginal burning syndrome after their sexual partners returned from the Persian Gulf. METHODOLOGY: The initial phase of this projec t has concentrated on identifying the population and characterizing the nature of their symptoms using screening questionnaires. Questionnaires assessing for post-traumatic stress disorder were also included. Subjects were identified through local and regional veterans hospital Gulf War sc reening physicians, in response to media press releases pertaining to this investigation and through a \"Burning Semen Sy ndrome\" (BSS) web page on the internet. A pilot project was conducted to more thoroughly investigate a small group of PGW veterans in local proximity to t he Cincinnati Veterans Administration Hospital (VAH). This evaluation included more detailed questionnaires related to their medical history before and after their tour of duty in the Persian Gulf, potential exposures wh ile there and the nature of their burning semen symptoms. Screening blood tests were performed on both the PGW veteran and their sexual partner to exclude underlying etiologies such as sexually transmitted diseases. Semen was obtained from each male participant and cultured to exclude vira l, bacterial and fungal infections. Each female underwent a pap smear with cervical and vaginal cu ltures to exclude viral, bacterial and fungal infections. Both subjects were skin tested to per ennial and seasonal allergens to assess their atopic state. Each subject was also skin tested to the male's whole semen to diagnose or exclude an immediate type allergic response. Serum from each subject was also used to determine if IgG, IgE and IgA specific antibodies were being produced in response to seminal plasma proteins using an ELISA method. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES) : If the hypotheses are correct, 1) women with seminal plasma hypersensitivity and vaginal burning syndrome will demonstrate immediate cutaneous reactivity to seminal plasma protein fractions; 2) one or more seminal plasma proteins that cause localized vaginal symptoms in our civilian group of wom en will also cause similar symptoms in women with Gulf War vaginal burning syndrome; and 3) the ability of seminal plasma proteins to regulate (either stimulate or inhibit) the humoral, cellula r or secretory immune responses after exposure to physical and chemical factors encountered in the Gulf War. STATUS: Preliminary findings: A total of 46 individuals responded to the screening questionnaires. All of the respondents were male; 41 of 46 of t heir female sexual partners experienced a burning sensation after contact with semen while only 15 of the males experienced burning after contact with their own semen. The completion rate of t he questionnaires proportionally decreased as they became lengthier and more complex. There di d not appear to be any correlation between BSS and post-traumatic stress disorder among those that co mpleted all of the questionnaires. Six male PGW veterans and five of their respective sexual partn ers participated in the pilot study (one of the PGW veteran's female sexual partner declined participation as she was asymptomatic). Four of the six male PGW veterans and two of the five female sexu al partners exhibited positi ve skin tests consistent with atopy. None of the participants or their sexual partners elicited positive skin test reactions to their whole semen nor were specific serum IgG, IgA or IgE antibodies to seminal plasma proteins detected using an ELISA method. Three women had Ureaplasma Urealyticum isolated from their cervical cultures, one grew streptococcus Group B from their cervical culture and one had an active yeast infection. Two of the women had si gnificant ANA titers and one had an increased sedimentation rate. Work is in progress utilizing polymerase chain reaction methodology to identify ureaplasma urealyicum in the semen of PGW vete rans which could not be isolated by culture. Investigation is also centered on identifying whether bacteriostatic proteins and other bacteriostatic compounds (i.e. Zinc sulfate) are deficient in their semen making their sexual partner more susceptible to infection. Active recruitment will continue during the next two years to identify a larger number of PGW couples with BSS who will undergo extensive medical evaluati on similar to that conduc ted on first year pilot study participants. Cohort c ontrol groups consisting of asymptomatic PGW veterans deployed and non-deployed to the Persian Gulf are also being recrui ted to participate in this project. These initial findings suggest that infection may be playing a sign ificant role in causing burning semen symptoms. All subjects with evidence of infection will be offered treatment with appropriate antibiotics and/or antifungals to determine if the burning symptoms are attenuated. More detailed evaluation of a larger population of PGW veterans with BSS and cohort contro l groups is necessary before linkage of BSS to service in the Persian Gulf can be established.

MI, Ann Arbor Project Status: Ongoing Research Type: P.I.: Penny F. Resear ch Symptoms/General Health Start Date (CY): 1996 Est. Completion (CY): 1999 Brain & Nervous System Reproductive Health OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: This study will compare the prevalence of general and gender specific health problems in 900 Air force women deployed to the Gulf and 900 Air Force women deployed elsewhere. SPECIFIC AIMS: To assess whet her the prevalence of health problems remain elevated in women deployed to the Gulf at six years post deploymen t, after controlling for potentially confounding factors such as age, reproductive history, sexual history, and lifestyle factors. METHODOLOGY: This research is to describe t he incidence, prevalence, and nature of symptoms associated with Persian Gulf War service within a randomized sample of Air Force women. Our design is developed on previous experience with two studies of Gulf War veteran women as well as the recommendations of numerous military and civ ilian scientific groups established to address this body of research. Specifically, in previous studies we have used a comparison group of women deployed to sites other than the theater of the wa r under the assumption they were physically fit for duty and would provide a better comparison than those who did not deploy perhaps for physical health reasons. Further sampling strategies will follow the recommendations for both the National Institutes of Health (NIH, 1994) and the Instit ute of Medicine (IOM, 1995; Roberts, 1995), who both call for well-designed epidemiologic studies. In both our previous studies we used a randomized stratified factorial design (theater vs. non-t heater; parent vs. non-parent; and component (active, guard, and reserve). Similar sampling procedures will be used in this study in order to control for potentially confounding effects of component and pat ernal status. This study will also include detailed information on sexual, reproductive, and menstrual history to allow for more complete analyses of findings. Sample size and power will detect differences observ ed in previous studies. Data collection involves recruiting the study participants and maximizing the response rate while minimizing attrition. A single comprehensive questionnaire will provide basic demographic, socionomic, and background information and include measures of general physical health and measures of gender-specific health. Mental health measures include assessment of depression, somatization, and 8 PTSD specific to Gulf War service and will include a stre ssful life event measure. Data processing includes all appropriate range and logic checks. Statistica l analyses include descriptive statistics, cross tabulations with chi-square and t-tests, distribut ions, and multiple regression analyses for health outcomes and deployment status. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): Three project years: 1) all planning and pre-testing during year 1; one-half of data collection (mail admin istration) in year 1 and the second half in year 2; all coding and data entry in year 2; and the final report and electronic data file as deliverables.

DC Project Status: Ongoing Research Type: Clinical Research P.I.: Raymond Chung, MD, Research Focus: Diagnosis Start Date (CY): 1995 Est. Completion (CY): 1998 OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: This study is designed to find evidence for mycoplasmal infections in symptomatic Operation Desert Storm veterans, by comparing the rate of seroconversion in symptomatic veterans as compared to healthy Gulf veterans and by culturing for Mycoplasma organisms in symptomatic and healthy Gulf veterans. SPECIFIC AIMS: See objectives. METHODOLOGY: This study has two parts: (1) Se ra from 200 symptomatic Gulf veterans and 200 healthy Gulf veterans, stored in the U.S. Armed Forces HIV Repository are used. Sera prior to and after deployment to South West Asia are tested fo r antibody to M. fermentans, M. genitalium, and M. penetrans. (2) Blood, urine, oropharyngeal, and rectal samples in 100 consecutive veterans undergoing evaluation at WRAMC and 100 asymptomatic veterans are tested for evidence of mycoplasmal infection by culture, serology and PCR. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES) : August 1996 - Initial Part One results; March 1997 - Addendum Part One results; August 1997 - Part Two complete. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Part one of t he study was done using 151 cases and 151 age and gender matched controls. There was no statistically significant difference in the seroconversion rate to any of the aforementioned Mycoplasma. Howe ver the seroconversion rate was unexpectedly low: 1.5% for controls and 3.0% in cases for M. fermentans. The odds ratio (OR) for cases compared to controls was 2.0 with a confidence interval of 0.4 - 10.9. In order to be able to detect an OR of 2 with a background seroconversion rate of 1 - 2% with 80% power, a larger study needs to be done. An addendum to the protocol has been submitted. Part two of the study is still ongoing, and as of 9 Sep 1996, 41 symptomatic veterans and 18 healthy c ontrols have entered the study. No significant difference in the seroconversion rate to Mycoplasma has been found when comparing symptomatic to healthy Gulf veterans. Because of the low sero conversion rate, the power of part one of the study is low and a larger sample size will allow a better estimation of seroconversion to Mycoplasma in this population.

DC Project Completed Research Type: Clinical Research P.I.: William N. Fishbein, Research Focus: Immunology Start Date (CY): 1995 Est. Completion (CY): 1997 OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: This study is designed to determine the frequency of chromosome 7 inversions in blood lymphocytes of four groups of volunteers: 1) symptomatic Gulf War veterans with findings consistent with a di agnosis of autoimmune or collagen vascular disease, 2) Gulf War veterans without abnormalities, 3) symptomatic volunteers with autoimmune or collagen vascular disease, and 4) healthy volunteers with no Gulf War exposure. SPECIFIC AIMS: See objectives. METHODOLOGY: Blood will be obtained from twenty five consecutive cases of each of the four groups. The samples are examined for the chromoso me 7 inversion blindly in the laboratory of Dr. William Fishbein, an investigator from the AFIP . After the 100 samples the investigators will be unblinded and a statistical analysis will be done. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): March 1997 - co llection complete; April 1997 - Analysis complete. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: This study of 102 cases has now been completed, after data distribution, breaking of the code, and statistica l analysis. There was adequate matching of age, sex, and race, and no evidence was found for genetic instability among symptomatic Gulf War veterans, or any of the other groups test ed; a preliminary report will be presented at the Experimental Biology meeting in San Francisco in April, 1998.

Benschop, Research Focus: Chemical Weapons Start Date (CY): 1996 Est. Completion (CY): 2000 Diagnosis OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Develop procedure s to assess mustard vesicant agent levels (which are highly reactive and show little persistence in vivo) in patients, based on estimation of exposure levels from levels of sulfur mustard a dducts to DNA and proteins in tissue samples. The principal objective of this research is to dev elop methodologies that can be readily adapted for use in the field. SPECIFIC AIMS: Three quantitativ e assessment procedures will be developed and tested in one set of animal experiments for mutual assay validation. There are: 1) immunochemical assays of sulfur mustard adducts to DNA in human blood and skin; 2) GC/MS determination of the N7-adduct of sulfur mustard with guanine (N7-HETE-Gua) in human blood, skin, and urine; and, 3) GC/MS determination of the sulfur mustard adduct to the N-terminal valine in blood hemoglobin. The practical applicability of the assays will be confirmed by dem onstrating the assays at an independent institute. METHODOLOGY: The feasibility of this project was proved in the pr evious research where it was proposed to use 35S-sulfur mustard to isolate the adducts. This technique was fruitful with protein adducts in research with hemoglobin. It has been e ffective in labeling loss of heterozygosity. There is no reason to believe it would not work with albumin and keratin. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): Laboratory re search to be performed 10/1/96-9/30/99; 10/1/99-2/28/00 will be report preparation and review. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: See expected products.

Completion (CY): 1999 OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Develop method ology for and clarify the toxicokinetics of VX stereoisomers in laboratory animals. SPECIFIC AIMS: Develop methodology for and clarif y the toxicokinetics of VX stereoisomers in laboratory animals. METHODOLOGY: VX enantiomers will be resolved using a detection apparatus to be developed early in the study. The sensitivities of gas chromatographic analysis in combination with mass spectrometry will be compared with that for mi cro-liquid chromatography employed with a chiral stationary phase. Thermionic and/or flame phot ometric detection limit of 10 pg per enantiomer. Once selected, the system will be used to identif y and quantify +/- VX metabolites generated in vitro in blood, and from liver and skin homogenates from animals, and, if possible, human tissue. In vivo toxicokinetics and metabolism will be determined in the blood of anesthetized, atropinized, and artificially ventilated hairless guinea pigs. The initial time frame for blood sampling will be up to 60 minutes after intoxication and will be modified as appropriate. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): Successful completion of th is research would enhance the understanding of VX toxicokinetics and metabolic elimination. This information is important because of uncertainties in current pretreatment strategies stemming from differences between VX and its G agent counterparts. Among military chemical agents, VX is the most specific for acetylcholinesterase and is the most toxic. It is also persistent in the field and offers the greatest hazard to military personnel following direct expo sure or indirect exposure from the handling of contaminated individuals or materials. It is anticipat ed that the toxicokinetics of VX will differ from its G agent counterparts.

PUBLICATIONS: none to date Persian Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Research Database - Project No DoD-51 Title: Transgenic Engineering of Cholinesterases: Tools for Exploring Cholinergic Project #: DoD-51 Agency: DoD Study Location: Hebrew Univ of Jerusalem, Ongoing Basic Research P.I.: Hermona Soreq, Ph.D. Research Focus: Chemical Weapons Start Date (CY): 1996 Est. Completion (CY): 2000 Prevention OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: To assess the pot ential of transgenic cholinesterases to protect organisms against anticholinesterase neurotoxicity. SPECIFIC AIMS: Our previous work has demonstrate d that overexpression of a specific alternative variant of the acetylcholine-hydrolyzing enzyme acetylcholinestersae (AChE) in brain protects transgenic mice against the acute toxicity of organophosphate (OP) poisons. However, we also observed that chronic overexpre ssion of AChE in the central ne rvous system (CNS) may promote delayed impairments in cognitive and neuromotor fu nction. Our objectives, therefore, are to determine the specific cholinesterase isoforms and mode(s) of expressi on conferring the greatest level of protection against OP poisoning with the least side effects. To this end, we aim to develop animal models for testing the protective value and po tential side-effects of transgenic overexpression of various human cholinesterases. In addition, we shall search for genetic factors conferring variability in the susceptibility of individuals to OP intoxication. METHODOLOGY: To study the protective effects of overexpressed AChE on the nervous system, we established transgenic mice carrying two copies of the human gene encoding the synaptic form of AChE. These mice display elevated levels of AchE in central cholinergic neurons normally expressing this enzyme and reduced sensitivity to cholinergic intoxication. However, despite apparently normal embryonic and early post-n atal development, ACHE-transgenic mice exhibit delayed-onset, progressive impairments in central cognitive functions such as learning and memory, and in neuromotor function. To determine the prot ective value of alternative AChE isoforms with different subcellular and tissue-specific pattern s of expression, and to dissect the mechanism(s) through which excess AChE mediates late onset neuropathologies, we are establishing additional lines of transgenic mice. Using these mice, we wish to determine whether soluble or partially amphiphilic forms of the protein co nfer greater protection, in whic h tissues these enzymes should be expressed, whether the long-ter m effects of overexpression are dep endent on the catalytic activity of the enzyme, and whether specific alternative C-terminal peptide domains may exert more active roles in mediating neurodegenerative processes. To investigate possible genetic polymorphisms affecting sensitivity to anticholinesterases we are studying upstream regulatory sequences in the human ACHE gene promoter . EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): This project is designed to select the cholinesterase variant(s) with the greatest potential to protect an organism from the acute toxicity of OP poisons, while elucidating the mechanisms of delayed neuro pathologies induced by chronic overexpression of AchE in the CNS. These studies will therefore a llow us to develop strategies for the safe use of transgenic cholinesterases as part of our chemical defense arsenal. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: The investigator s have constructed and expressed a variety of catalytically active and inactive variants of in Xenopus oocytes and embryos and characterized their biochemical properties in the amphibian. They have identified neurite growth-promoting activities of some variants, and shown this activity to be independent of acetylcholine hydrolysis. These constructs were then used to establish new lin es of transgenic mice which are currently being characterized for expression of the transgenes. An additional line of transgenic mice carrying DNA encoding an antisense RNA targeted against rodent AchE is being established as a first step in the long-term project of establishing mice expressi ng exclusively or predominantly the human enzyme. Once the spatiotemporal expression pattern(s) of the various transgenes are characterized, the sensitivity of the different lines of mice to OP poisons will be tested. At the same time, long-term performance of these mice in tests of cogniti on and neuromotor function will be examined. DNA samples are also being collected from hu man subjects presenting hypersensitivity to anticholinesterases used in medical or agricultur al settings and searching for possible allelic variations in either the ACHE or BCHE gene wh ich might be correlated with adverse reactions to these compounds. To date, t he investigators have identified a single point mutation in the human BCHE gene coding sequence and a rare pol ymorphism in the human ACHE gene upstream promoter region that may confer hypersensitivi ty to a variety of cholinesterase inhibitors.

Persian Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Research Database - Project No DoD-52 Title: Female Gender and Other Potential Pred ictors of Functional Health Status Among Persian Gulf War Veterans Project #: DoD-52 Agency: VA Study Location: VAMC Boston Project Status: Research Type: Epidemiology Research P.I.: Jessica Wolfe Research Focus: Brain & Nervous System Start Date (CY): 1995 Est. Completion (CY): 1998 Symptoms/General Health OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study is to identify and describe the effects of potential predictors on the functional h ealth status and health perceptions of male and female veterans approximately four years after their deployment to the Persian Gulf; and to examine if and how identified risk factors differ between female and male veterans. A secondary objective of the proposed project is to ascertain the prevalen ce of multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS)-like symptoms reported among this population, and to ex plore risk factors for the development of this syndrome. SPECIFIC AIMS: The more specific goal of this study is to use the obtained data to significantly advance DoD screening and intervention effo rts aimed at enhancing positive military and post-deployment adaptation among soldiers, especial ly women. With women's rapidly increasing representation in the U.S. Armed Forces, there is a pressing need to investigate these relationships, and to understand factors that might be distinctiv ely associated with womens' well-being, both during and following war-time deployment. METHODOLOGY: By using cross-sectional and longitudinal data from an existing, carefully followed military cohort and by expanding predefined measures of health symptoms, and health perceptions, this investigation is conducting analyses that fo cus directly on: (a) defining the set of reported environmental and psychosocial combat-theater ex posures and physical health variables associated with female and male soldiers recent deployment; and, (b) describing the relationship of these variables to functional status and self-re ported physical health. A primary emphasis is on investigating the role or impact of gender, specifically, whether female gender is a significant factor in predicting either functional health status or health perceptions. Data analyses will proceed through a series of three major stages. The initial stage involves generation of descriptive analyses for all variables of interest and will permit comparison of responses between women and men. The second stage involves the determination of bivariate odd s ratios of gender, PTSD diagnostic status, and environmental exposure on functional health status. The third stage involves multivariate regression procedures to examine the effects of gender, PTSD and reported environmental exposure on functional status and on self-reported health. In addition, an exploratory analysis will be conduc ted of the comprehensive symptom review results with respect to the diagnosis of Multiple Chemical Sensitivity. One of the first steps in ascertaining the prevalence of MCS-like symptoms among our st udy population is developing a survey instrument that can be used to identify subjects with MCS-like symptoms. To date, there is only one survey instrument that has been validated to assess MCS symptoms. However, due to its length, we are currently testing the validity of a shortened versio n of this existing questionnaire on patients referred to the Massachusetts Respiratory Hospital, and controls recruited by participating patients. Depending on the prevalence of individuals who meet criteria for MCS-like symptoms, mulivariate models similar to those for functional status with MCS-like symptoms as the dependent variable will be conducted. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): To develop a shorter questio nnaire than the one currently used to identify MCS, scientific publications on Persian Gulf War illnesses (including the impact of stress and trauma on outcome, annual reports, gender models of health outcomes. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: A manuscript reporting the development of a short MCS questionnaire is currently under review (Hu, Stern, Rotnitzky et al.). After 3 mailings of the Time 4 questionnaire, approximately 43% of the origin al Devens cohort of 2949 PGW veterans have returned completed surveys. Additional phone su rveys are planned to sample non-responders and assess the extent to which they may differ from responders. Appropriate weighting procedures can then be applied to statistically minimi ze the effects of any response bias. PUBLICATIONS: Proctor SP, Wolfe J, Friedman M.

Completion (CY): 2000 Brain & Nervous System OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: The overall project objective is to determine the toxiokinetics of inhaled sarin on F344 rats and to determine if single or repeated (5X and 10X) exposures to low levels of sarin results in changes in the quantity of cholinergic synaptic markers. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1. Determine the dosimetry of i nhaled tritiated-sarin. 2. Determine the effect of subclinical exposures to sarin on cholinergic synaptic markers. METHODOLOGY: Specific Aim I will be accomplished in 3 steps: Step 1: Expose rats by inhalation to two levels of tritiated sarin; Step 2. Analyze brain slices and critical areas of the brain for tritium at three time points after exposure; Step 3. De termine clearance time for sarin and its metabolites. Specific Aim II will be accomplished in 2 steps: Step 1. Expose rats to a high and a low dose of sarin; Step 2. Determine muscarinic and nicotinic receptor densities as well as acetylcholine esterase and choline acetyl transferase activities and choline uptake mechanisms in the brains of exposed rats at one (1) day and one (1) month after exposure. Results will illustrate the degree of persistence of the effects. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILEST ONES): In this study we expect to determine the dosimetry to the brain of different inhalation exposure concentratio ns of sarin and how long the agent remains in critical areas of the brain. We expect to complete these studies during the first 18 months of the study. We expect to complete the studies on the effect of single and repeated exposures to sarin on the quantity of cholinergic synaptic marker s during the last two years of the study. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: The lab has been set up to meet safety and security requirements. The synthesis of tritiated sarin has begun.

Completion (CY): 1999 Brain & Nervous System Chemical Weapons OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: The primary objective is to determine if exposure to low levels of sarin (GB) create neurobehavioral or neuropathologic effects. Another objective is to assess the effect of low-level GB exposure on possible toxi c effects produced by other chemicals, especially chemicals that have a mechanism of action similar to that of GB. SPECIFIC AIMS: The specific aim is to determine if subtle abnormal neurobehavioral or neuropathologic effects are detected as a result of short term exposure to low levels of chemicals, or combinations of chemicals, to which U.S. servicem en were exposed in the Persian Gulf area. A total of 9 groups of rats, vehicle with 24 rats per group will be evaluated in stages. Results will be analyzed to determine if any e ffects are statistically significant. METHODOLOGY: The study is designed to evaluat e neurobehavioral and neuropathologic alterations that may result from exposure to GB alone and fr om exposure to GB and a combination of chemicals, PB, DEET, and CPF, at dose levels which, wh en given alone, may produce a measurable effect (e.g., blood acetylcholinesterase [AchE] inhibiti on) but do not produce observable signs of exposure. The test system is a mature, outbred rat strain which is capable of exhibiting neuropathologic alteration following exposure to organophosphorus compounds known to cause delayed neuropathy. Pilot Studies are conducted to establish a dose of each chemical, given over as 4 day period, that may produce a measurable effect but does not produce clinical signs of intoxication. These doses will be used in the Subchronic Study in which animals are exposed to chemicals, as well as chemical combinations, over a 4 day period and monitored for up to 30 days. Neurobehavioral assessments (Functional Observational Battery [FOB] and evaluation of motor activity) are performed prior to and three times following exposures. At the time of sacrifice (30 days post-exposure), specimens from the central and peripheral nervous system are ta ken for neuropathologic evaluation. During both phases, blood AchE activities are assessed. A control compound, such as carbaryl, is used to produce neurobehavioral abnormalities. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): The milestones will be completion of the Pilot Studies, completion of the Subchronic Study neurobehavio ral evaluations, completion of the neuropathology evaluations, statistical analyses of the data, and report preparation. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: The contract for this proposal was signed September 29, 1997. MREF Protocol 134 was prepared and reviewed and approved by both Battelle's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and the U.S. Army MRMC Animal Use Review Officer, MAJ David L. Ruble. The use of GB already at the MR EF was approved by USAMRMC. DEET and PB have been ordered and received, and 5 g of CPF were requested and received from Dow Elanco. A shipment of 146 Sprague-Dawley rats approximat ely 3 months of age was received in December 1997. This is the oldest age at which rats are available, although a 6 month old rat is required for testing in subchronic studies. A technique for pe riodic blood sampling of these animals without the use of anesthesia is being developed. Rat blood is being analyzed for cholinesterase activity using both dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)(DTNB) with er ythrocytes and dithionicotinic acid (DTNA) with whole blood in order to determine relationships and to attain better accuracy in measuring low levels of cholinesterase inhibition.

Completion (CY): 2000 Chemical Weapons Pyridostigmine Bromide OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between C.t-values, internal dose and adverse effects on performance in guinea pigs and marmoset monkeys which will be exposed to low levels of sarin (GB). SPECIFIC AIMS: (1) At which C.t-value (t \u00a3 5 h) of GB exposure does an internal dose of GB become measurable, i.e., what is the lowest observable effect level of exposure (LOEL)?; (2) At which C.t-value (t \u00a3 5 h) of GB exposure and inte rnal dose do these (systemic) effects of exposure start to have adverse effects on the performance of military personnel (LOAEL)?; (3) What are the consequences of continuous carbamate pretreatment during low level exposure to GB, i.e., will unexpected adverse effects on performance emerge th rough this combination of two cholinesterase inhibitors?; (4) What is the time course of adverse effects on perform ance following GB exposure and are there delayed effects? METHODOLOGY: A number of central nervous sy stem effects and miosis will be measured as sensitive and relevant parameters of incapacitation. EXPECTED PRODUCTS: In this study we expect to get answers to the abov e-mentioned practically relevant questions. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: A number of Techni cal Objectives are being conducted which are necessary to be able to execute the proposed ex periments: (1) A glass exposure chamber for whole-body exposure of unanaesthetized guinea pigs and marmosets (one animal per chamber) to low levels of GB vapor in air, has been designed and constructed, which is at the implementation stage. This equipment should meet a number of requirements in order to measure a number of parameters on-line during exposure in a safe wa y: respiration, EEG and miosis. Moreover, blood samples for toxicokinetic analysis and measuring ChE-activities should be taken during exposure; (2) The implementation of the telemetric method for measuring EEG-signals and the VER (visual evoked response) signal is making progress; (3) Differ ent types of cameras have been tested for real-time measurement of miosis on both eyes in guinea pi gs from outside the expos ure chamber. The most suitable digital camera has been chosen; (4) The dosimetry method to determine the internal dose of GB bound to BuChE in guinea pigs is operational by now.

Completion (CY): 2001 Chemical Weapons Pyridostigmine Bromide OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: To \"Conduct animal studies designed to assess the possible long-term or delayed clinical effects of low-level or sublinical exposures to chemical warfare agents.\" The nerve agent sarin (GB) will be assessed for its ability to induce peripheral neuropathy and myopathy in the presence and absence of co-expos ure to pyridostigmine bromide (PB). Sensitive morphological methods will be used to examine the delayed effects of low-level and sub-clinical exposures to sarin on the structure of the hen and mouse brain, spinal cord, peripheral neuromuscular and peripheral sensory system. SPECIFIC AIMS: TASK ONE: Baseline DATA 1) De termine baseline levels (in the hen and mouse) of: acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholines terase (BChE), and Neuropathy Target Esterase (NTE) in brain, RBC and plasma (the avian erythroc yte lacks AChE activity): AChE and BChE in the muscle; the kinetics blood AChE/BChE to the test agents sarin, DFP, paraox on and PB in vitro. Determine a high, non-lethal dosage and dosages that correspond to selected levels (i.e. 10%, 25%, %50%) of blood and brain AChE inhibition. Determine the differential agent sensitivity of hens and mice, and the induction of axonal degeneration in the spinal cord and peripheral nerves of DFP-treated mice. 2) Determine whether a single large dose of sarin (versus DF P and parathion) induces neurobehavioral signs of AChE-induced myopathy (e.g. proximal limb weak ness and histopathology) and subsequent signs of OPIDN (distal weakness), and to correlate these findings with biochemical and morphological indices of nerve-fiber damage. TASK TWO: Multiple Ex posures - Assess the effects of multiple sarin exposures using a strategy of stepping down the dosages of sarin progressively until no effects are detected upon morphological assay of spinal cord, peripheral nerve and muscle of hens, and these tissues plus brain regions and sensory and moto r terminals in mice. TASK THREE: Pyridostigmine Bromide (PB) - Establish the highest no-effect dos age (HNED) of multiple doses of PB for use in Task Four. Experiments outlined in Task One and Task Two will be repeated, except that PB will be substituted for sarin. A single large dose of PB, and multiple smaller doses of PB, are expected to induce sub-junctional myopathy in vulnerable mu scles. Absence of myopathic changes in animals treated with multiple doses of PB will provide the end-point for determ ination of the highest no-effect dosage of PB. TASK FOUR: Combined Effects of Sarin and PB - The final task is to determine whether the HNED of PB administered some days before, or shortly after sarin administration, causes the HNED of sarin to induce changes in biochemical or morphological parameters not present or greater than those found in animals treated with the same dose of sarin alone. METHODOLOGY: The delayed effects of exposure to sub-lethal doses of sarin may include changes in: (1) brain; (2) muscle and spontaneous activity; (3) peripheral nerves/spinal cord and spontaneous activity. Compounds known to induce spec ific toxicities will be used as positive controls for #2 (parathion) and #1 and #3 (DFP). Substances will be dissolv ed in saline, which will serve as a negative control agent. A stepwise series of experiments will be performed with avian and mammalian species. White Leghorn laying hens and male Swiss albino mice will be used: both species are reported to be sensitive to the ac ute and delayed neurotoxic effects of DFP and sarin. Biochemistry - ChE Determinations: acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and plasma non-specific cholinesterase (BChE) in mouse blood are differentiated by separating RBCs and plasma or by using an inhibitor of non-specific cholinesterase. Most samples are measured using the colorimetric method of Ellman, et al. (1961) modified for use with an automatic microplate reader. Samples with very low activity or samples from PB treated animals may be measured using the radiometric method of Johnson and Russell (1975). Neuropathy Target Esterase Determinations: Brain neuropathy target esterase (NTE) activity is determined by the colorimetric method of Johnson (1977) as modified by Wilson's laboratory (Mackay, et al., 1996) from that of Correll and Ehrich (1991). Creatine Kinase Determinaations: CK in plasma or muscle will be measur ed using the method of Hess, et al. (1968). Protein Determinations - Protein is measured by the method of Lowry (1951). Cytochemistry - Examination of muscle fibers will be carried out on frozen se ctions for morphology (hematoxylin and eosin) and cholinesterases with routine histological techniques modified from Karnovsky and Roots (1964) using acetylthiocholine as substrate (Wilson et al., 1990). Morphological and Morphometric Analyses - At des ignated time-points, animals will be anesthetized, heparinized, and perfused. Tissue samples will be ob tained mid-level and distal regions of nerves, and terminal-rich regions of sampled muscles. Tissues will be fixed and embedded in epoxy resin. One-micrometer-thick sections will be stained and examined by bright-field microscopy. Thin sections will be prepared as needed from sensor y and motor nerve terminals, treated and examined with a transmission electron microscope. Mo rphometric assessment will be carried out on perfect cross-sections of identical regions of distal nerves that show the earliest changes of DFP neuropathy. Focus will be placed on myelinated fibers which are most vulnerable in OP and other toxic neuropathies. Numbers of myelinated fiber s will be counted on light photomicrographs (final magnification X600). Sizes of myelinated axons will be estimated by tracing the perimeter of the inner aspect of the myelin sheath. Axonal diam eters and shape factor will be calculated from these measurements. The outer perimet er of the myelin sheath will be traced and used to determine nerve fiber perimeter, area and diam eter. Myelin sheath thickness (MST) will be calculated. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): Task one (year 1) will consis t of \"scoping\" trials to establish appropriate dose/response ranges for sari n, DFP and paraoxon. Task Two (years 1, 2) will determine thresholds and relative dose-effect leve ls for biochemical and morphological end-points. Tasks Three and Four (year 3) will examine whether pyridostigmine bromide (PB) induces responses to sub-threshold doses of sarin or DFP when t he carbamate is given days before administration of the organophosphate (OP). The results will indica te how much and how often exposure to sarin is needed to produce sub-clinical (i.e. structural a nd functional) neurotoxic effects, which regions of the nervous system are most sensitive to sarin, and whether PB is able to modulate (increase/decrease) the ne urotoxic potency of sarin. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Facilities are being readied for nerve agent work. Monitoring procedures and US Army approvals are being finalized. Animals: 60 male mice (strain Cd1) were received from Charles River Co. They have been acclimated to our animal facility. 60 female chicks (white leghorn) were received from Hyline. They are being raised to the appropriate age for our studies. The assay conditions for measuring cholinesterase in mouse are being standardized. The existing assay condition (1 mM acetylthiocholine substrate and pH 8 assay buffer) seem satisfactory. Cholinesterase activity levels in mouse RBC and plasma were 1.37+/-0.14 and 0.55+/-0.013 nmol/min/ml respectively. In comparison ac etylcholinesterase (AChE) and non-specific cholinesterase (BChE) levels in chicken plasma were 61.8 +/-11.2 and 551+/-62.7 in a past study conducted for the USAMRDC (B.W. Wilson et al., 1987, The actions of repeated exposures of VX on chickens). Birds do not have RBC cholineste rase; proportions of AChE and BChE vary by species.

Completion (CY): 2000 Brain & Nervous System OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: To address the as sociation between Persian Gulf War Illness (PGWI) and biological stress responses among women who served in the Persian Gulf War (PGW), to determine if individuals with PGWI have responses similar to that of individuals with fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, specifically targeting the causal relationship between PGWI and stress. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1. To perform clinical and psychological evaluat ion on a sampling of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals deployed to the PG W; 2. To determine if PGWI patients show evidence of a low central corticotropin releas ing hormone (CRH) state by administering IL-6 and evaluating ACTH response; 3. To demonstrat e that PGWI patients show evidence of impaired activation of the adrenomedullary and sympathone ural components of t he sympathetic nervous system evidenced by biological responses to dol orimiter testing, tilt table testing and computer testing; 4. To demonstrate that PGWI patients have evidence of a decreased peripheral responsiveness to catecholamines as seen in biologica l responses to tilt table testing; 5. To show that significant abnormalities to these components of the stress response can be noted in most PGWI patients and that the nature of the abnormality can predict the predominant clinical symptoms. METHODOLOGY: The first year of research will involve finalizing project plans, developing a sampling frame, and recruiting and evaluating 35 pa rticipants, including 35 patients and 25 controls; and generating mid-term and quarterly reports of pr ogress. Patient recruitment will continue into the third year to include 20 patients and 5 controls and data analysis will begin. Correlation will be made between self-reported medical information and clinical data, and data from this study will be linked to the Persian Gulf Women's Health Linkage Study for further analysis. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): To gain a better understanding of the pathophysiology of PGWI in order to improve recomm endations for treatment of patients. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: The final stages of project planning are currently underway and the early stages of pati ent recruitment have begun.

Completion (CY): 2001 Brain & Nervous System OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: To compare the true rate of confirmed disease among samples of veterans deployed to the Gulf with and without these predefined conditions, versus true rate of confirmed disease among samples of veterans not deployed, with and without these self-reported conditions. SPECIFIC AIMS: The purpose of the current project is to compare the rates of false positive reports of illness among both deployed and non-deployed veterans. Because of the magnitude of the difference in prevalence between these groups, we feel it is important to explore and characterize their cognitive deficits, depression, and multisys temic conditions. These studies will be performed by comparing the true rate of confirmed disease among samples of veterans deployed to the Gulf with and without these self-reported conditions versus the true rate of confirmed disease among samples of veterans not deployed with and without these se lf-reported conditions. Furthermore, we plan to also compare risk factors including medical and fa mily history, psychological factors (such as major lifetime events or stress, pers onality traits, and social support), and occupational and environmental exposures for validated illness in a series of nes ted case-control studies for each illness outcome. METHODOLOGY: A sample of veterans deployed to the Gulf and of non-deployed veterans who met pre-defined criteria for one of the four condition s of interest will be invited to participate in the follow-up studies. Additionally, a sample of s ubjects who did not meet criteria for any of the telephone survey conditions selected from among those deployed and not deployed to the Gulf will serve as controls. Selected subjects will be in vited to participate in detailed personal interviews, physical examinations, structur ed neuropsychological, neurophysiol ogical, psychiatric, and other laboratory testing. STUDY 1 is comprised of va rious tests for cognitive dysfunction. STUDY 2 is comprised of specific psychiatric testing for depres sion. STUDY 3 is comprised of testing batteries examining for Multisystemic Conditions. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): In this study, we plan to determine if the rate of false positives of the deployed Iowa Persian Gulf Vetera ns' self-reports of cognitive dysfunction (CD) are the same as the rate of false positives of the nondeployed PGW veterans self-reports of CD. We will also determine if the rate of false positives of the deployed Iowa Persian Gulf Veterans' (PGW veterans) self-reports of depression are the same as the rate of false positives of the nondeployed PGW veterans self-reports of depression. Finally, we will determine if the rate of false positives of the deployed Iowa Persian Gulf Veterans' (PGW veterans) self-reports of multisystemic conditions (fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, multiple ch emical sensitivity) are the same as the rate of false positives of the nondeployed PGW vetera ns self-reports of multisystemic conditions. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: The grant funding just began September 25, 1997. Thus far, we have begun the process of recruiting the Study Coordinator and Prog rammer/Analyst. We have also began developing and revising data collection forms, and obtaining final human subjects approval from the Department of the Army and the University of Iowa.

Isom, Ph.D. Research Focus Pyridostigmine Bromide Start Date (CY): Est. Completion (CY): 2000 Brain & Nervous System OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Characterize the neurotoxic response to pyridostigmine by determining the exposure conditions required to induce neurodegeneration in the rat brain and examine the underlying mechanism in a neuronal cell model. This will be accomplished by administering varying doses of pyridostigmine to rats and at specific times, the brains will be examined histologically and by molecular biology proc edures for apoptotic cell death. Cultured cells from the brain area(s) that undergo degeneration will be used to de termine the molecular processes that pyridostigmine activates to initiate the brain cell death. Another objective is to determine the involvement of neuronal oxidative stress in the re sponse and to determine if antioxidants will attenuate the degeneration in animals and cultured cell models. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1. Characterize the dose-response of pyridostigmine-induced neuronal apoptosis in the rat brain and the ability of antioxidants to alter the neurotoxicity; 2. Detailed biochemical and molecular analysis of pyridostigmine-induced apoptosis in cultured cerebellar granule cells; 3. Determine the mechanism by which pyridostigmine st imulates the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species and the linkage to apoptosis. METHODOLOGY: Apoptosis will be documented in brain areas by the Apotage (TUNEL) method, electron microscopy morphometric analysis and DNA (fragmentation) laddering on gel electrophoresis. Mechani stic studies will include measurement of redox transcription activation by EMSA, reactive oxygen species generation by mi crofluorescence procedures, and mitochondrial dysfunction by use of fluorescence dyes. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): In this study, we expect to show that pyridostigmine induces neurodegeneration by initiating apoptosis ce ll death in the brain. The mechanism of this brain injury will determine by use of neuronal cell models. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: We are completing the dose-response study to pyridostigmine in rats and determining the duration of treatment required to produce neurodegeneration. We have documented by use of multiple analyses that 4 days of pyridostigmine treatment (0.5 to 1.85 mg/kg) induces apoptotic cell death in t he cortex, hippocampus and striatum.

Completion (CY): 1998 Pyridostigmine Bromide Prevention OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: If this hypothesi s is correct we expect to find a correlation between low levels of butyrylcholinesterase or between genetically abnormal butyrylcholinesterase and Gulf War Illness. Butyrylcholinesterase is a sc avenger of nerve agents. A person with low levels of this enzyme or with a genetically defective enz yme would be less protected from nerve agents with the result that more of the agent would reach the nerves. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1. To obtain blood samples from healthy and sick Gulf Wa r veterans; 2.To obtain histories from the subjects detailing their exposure and symptom; 3. To measure the activity levels and phenotype of butyrylcholinesterase; 4. To det ermine the genotype of the butyrylcholinesterase; 5.To see if Gulf War Illness correlates with butyrylcholinesterase activity level or genotype. METHODOLOGY: Gulf War veterans are recruited from the Omaha area. In addition, blood samples have been obtained from a collaborator at Walter Reed Army Research In stitute. Histories are obtained by interviewing the subjects. Blood sample s are tested for butyrylcholinesterase activity and phenotype with a spectrophotometric assay. The genotype is determined by amplifying the butyrylcholinesterase gene and sequencing the DNA. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES) : We expect to have collected 100 samples from the Omaha area and to have completed 100 interviews by spring 1998. Analysis of blood samples is ongoing. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: All veterans intervie wed to date believe there is a Gulf War Illness, regardless of their own health status. In answer to the question \"do you think you have Gulf War Illness?\" most veterans reply \"I don't know.\" Even those who consider themselves healthy wonder whether a symptom they have is a consequence of t heir service in the Gulf. The veterans attribute their illness to oil fire smoke, pyridostigmine pills, non-FDA approved shots, or possible exposure to nerve agents. Of the blood samples we have tested to date, the frequency of genetic variants was the same in veterans who claimed to have Gulf War Illness and in controls.

Olson, Ph.D. Research Focus: Interactions Start Date (CY): 1997 Est. Completion (CY): 2000 Chemical Weapons Pyridostigmine Bromide OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: The primary objective is to determine if exposure to low levels of GB creates subtle enzymatic, neurophysiologic or neuromuscular pathologic effects. Another objective is to assess the effect of low-level GB exposure on possible toxic effects produced by other chemicals, especially chemicals that have a me chanism of action similar to that of GB. SPECIFIC AIMS: To determine if subtle abnorma l enzymatic, neurophysi ologic or neuromuscular effects or neuropathology are caused as a result of short term exposure to low levels of chemicals, or combinations of chemicals, to which U.S. serv icemen were exposed in the Persian Gulf area. A total of 5 groups of rhesus monkeys, a saline c ontrol; a positive control, GB/BotTox, PB/DEET/CPF; GB/BotTox+PB/Deet/CPF, with 8 monkeys per grou p are evaluated in two stages. Results are analyzed to determine if any effects are statistically significant. METHODOLOGY: The study is designed to evaluate enzymatic, neurophysiologic and neuropathologic alterations that may result from ex posure to GB/BotTox alone and from exposures to GB/BotTox and a combination of PB, DEET, and CPF, at dose levels which, when given alone, may produce a measurable effect (e.g., blood acetylc holinesterase [AchE] inhibition) but do not produce observable signs of intoxication. Pilot Studies are conducted to establish a dose of each chemical, given over a 14 day period, that may produce a measurable effect but not produce clinical signs. These doses are used in the Subchronic Study in which animals are exposed over a 14 day period and evaluated for up to 170 days. Periodic neurophysiologic and electromyograp hic examinations of monkeys are performed. In addition, tissue specimens are examined for patho logy at study termination. During the study, blood esterase (NTE), creatine kinase (CK) and alanine control compound, diis opropyl fluorophosphate (DF), is used to produce neurophysiologic and neuropat hologic abnormalities. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES) : The completion of the Pilot Studies, completion of the Subchronic Study neurophysiologic evaluations at 24 hr, at 60 days, at 90 days, at 180 days, and at 270 days, completion of the neuropatho logy evaluations, completion of the statistical analyses of the data, and completion of a final report. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: The contract for this proposal was signed September 29, 1997. MREF Protocol 135 was prepared, and reviewed and approved by both Battelle's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and the U.S. Army MRMC Animal Use Review Officer, MAJ David L. Ruble. Botulinum toxoid was requested from USAMRMC and received. The use of GB already at the MREF was approved by USAMRMC. DFP, DEET, and PB have been ordered and received, and 5 g of chlorpyrifos was requested and has been received from Dow Elanco. A source of 60 male rhesus monkeys weighing approximately 3.5 to 6 kg was located, and a Purchase Order signed. These monkeys are to be shipped to the MREF in early 1998. Monkey blood is being analyzed for cholinesterase activity using both dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) with erythrocytes and dithionicotinic acid (DTNA) with whole blood in order to determine relationships and to attain better accuracy in measuring low levels of cholinesterase inhibition.

Completion (CY): 1999 Chemical Weapons Pyridostigmine Bromide OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: To elucidate whet her physical stress amplifies the neurotoxic effects and neuromuscular abnormalities after adm inistration of pyridostigmine, sarin and the combination of these two agents. SPECIFIC AIMS: (i) To evaluate the neurotoxic effe cts of low dose sarin in mice using behavioral (muscular weakness, ataxia, and motor on), enhanced lipid peroxidation) in brain, spinal cord, platelet s, and sciatic nerve and histopathological (light and electron microscopy) (axonal degeneration and demye lination in spinal cord and sciatic nerve and neuromuscular damage) analyses. (ii) To compare the above neurotoxic effe cts induced by low dose sarin exposure in pyridostigmine treated mice with untreated mice so as to determine the possible interactive effects of pyridostigmine with sarin-indu ced neurotoxicity. (iii) To evaluate the effects of physical stress on low dose sarin, pyridostigmine, and the combination of two to determine the above parameters and correlate with morbidit y associated with Gulf War veterans. METHODOLOGY: First year, we are doing the experim ents to investigate the interactive effects of exercise and pyridostigmine on neuro-behaviora l (muscular weakness, changes in NIH Swiss mice. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): In this study we expect to determine that physical exercise amplifies the neuromuscular abnormalities in pyridostigmine treated mice. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Sixty NIH Swiss mice were ordered and they have been divided into four groups of 15 animals. Animals in group III and VI are being exercised on treadmill. The experiments are in progress. After 10 weeks of various treatments, the animals will be observed for behavioral changes and neuromuscular dysfunction. They will be sacrificed after 10 weeks and biochemical and histopat hological changes in blo od, brain, spinal cord and sciatic nerve will be recorded. The data will be correlated with the morbidity associated with Gulf War Veterans.

Completion (CY): 2000 Chemical Weapons OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: We seek definitive evidence to support or refute the proposal that Gulf War veterans have nervous-system deficits consistent with prior exposure to organophosphorus (OP) chemicals. Focus will be placed on Desert Storm soldiers within a 50 km radius of Khamisiyah, Coalition-Occupied Iraq, who may have been expose d to sarin/cyclosarin following detonation of Bunker 73 in March 1991. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1. Compare t he neurobehavioral and neurophysiological status of PGW veterans who served exclusively in Desert Shield vers us those who served in Desert Storm and who were present in the Khamisiyah area during the first two weeks of March 1991. 2. Search for evidence of neurological damage consistent with the long-te rm sequelae of symptomatic exposure to OP compounds. 3. Determine the potential of devel oping an inexpensive neurobehavioral screening test to predict neurological damage associated with OP poisoning. METHODOLOGY: Desert Storm soldiers who were proximate to Khamisiyah during and following detonation of shells containing sarin/cyclosarin will be given neuropsychological and neurophysiological examinations tailored for the detection of OP-induced deficits. Comparison groups will include other Desert Storm veterans , and veterans who only served in Desert Shield. Baseline data will be obtained from PGW-era non-deployed veterans. Civilians with a documented history of non-convulsive symptomat ic exposure to OP insecticides will serve as positive controls. Symptoms, functional neurobehavioral performa nce, and neurophysiological measures will be assessed in study groups. The fit between the spat ial-temporal location of veterans, known releases of OP nerve agents, and evidence of neurological deficits will be determined. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): 1. Characterize OP-related nervous system changes in civilian positive controls; 2. Obtain database from the Department of Defense (DoD) of the DoD-estimated 20,000 individuals in the Khamisiyah cohort (50 km radius only) with possible sarin/cyclosarin expos ure. Complete sampling plan; 3. Locate deployed and nondeployed subjects and carry out exposure/health interviews; 4. Carry out and analyze results of neurobehavioral testing (Phase 1); 5. Carry out and analyze result s of neurophysiological examination (Phase 2). STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: 1) Items that have been developed include: the study protocol; introductory letter; the script introducing the computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI), including the consent statement that will be read; a draft of the study CATI questionnaire; and details of the neurophysiological test battery. These are under mandatory review by the Human Subjects Review Board of the Office of the Surgeon General. 2) Human studies will commence upon approval from the Human Subjects Review Board of the Office of the Surgeon General. 3) Bids have been solicited for the CATI. Note: Activation of human subject research has been delayed by several months because of an unadvertised requirement for review of this IRB-approved proposed human research by the Office of the Surgeon General.

Cook, Ph.D. Research Focus: Pyridostigmine Bromide Start Date (CY): 1997 Est. Completion (CY): 2001 Brain & Nervous System Prevention OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: To provide the U.S. Army with a more complete body of knowledge for optimal use of pyridostigmine as a prophylactic organophosphate-defense agent if a future large-scale deployment is needed. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) Conduct a study to quantify any physiological or perfor mance consequences of the use of pyridostigmine; 2) determine whether exposure to heat exacerbates any effects found; and, 3) evaluate individual differences in cholin esterase inhibition that might predict deleterious response to pyridostigmine. METHODOLOGY: In the first study, two groups of subjects (at least 18 men and 18 women per group) will be randomly assigned to take 30 or 60 mg PYR for 13 doses at 8-hour intervals. Each subject will also take 13 doses of placebo, and order of PYR and placebo will be counter-balanced. Testing will occur on days 4 and 5 of each drug regimen. The test battery to be administered includes physiological, sensorimotor, and cognit ive measures. In the second study, men and women will follow the same pyridostigmine regimen, but will be tested in the heat on those physiological and performance tasks that showed effects in the first study. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTON ES): Study 1 should be completed by September 1999. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Data collection for Study 1 should begin in March or April 1998.

Completion (CY): 2000 OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: 1) Demonstrat e the specific sites and nature of neurologic damage associated with the symptoms comprising the case definition; 2) Develop a two stage system of testing and confirming the diagnosis of neurological impairment in Gulf War veterans for use in cost-effective screening of large populations of Gulf War veterans; 3) Provide insights into the pathophysiology of the neurologic impairment of Gulf War veterans upon which to base approaches to treatment. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) Extend the battery of tests for detecting neurotoxic brai n and nerve damage; 2) Enlarge the sample of cases and controls from the prior sample of 46 to 100; 3) Apply the new battery to all 100 cases and controls; 4) Plan and conduct a population survey of Gulf War veterans to estimate the prevalence of the case defi nition of Gulf War-related neurologic syndrome; 5) Corroborate the pathophysiology of the neurologic dysfunction fo und in the population survey. METHODOLOGY: In the first six months, we will perf orm the extended battery of tests on the original 46 cases and controls, and plan the population replication su rvey. In the second six months, we will perform the extended battery of tests on the 54 cases and controls added to the sample, and conduct the population replication survey and analyze the results. In the second year, we will perform the most predictive subset of the extended battery of tests on cases and controls selected from the population survey. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): By the end of the fist year, we expect to have demonstrated the extent and natur e of neurotoxic damage responsi ble for symptoms satisfying the case definition of the Gulf War-relat ed neurologic syndrome, have demonstrated the pathophysiologic basis for many of the symptoms, hav e identified a subset of tests most useful for identifying it, and have estimated the prevalence of the syndrome in the deployed and nondeployed populations of Gulf War-era veterans. By the end of the second year, we expect to have demonstrated whether the veterans satisfying the case definition in the population sample have the same neurologic basis as those in the initial sample. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: 1. Conducted an epidemiologic survey of a reserve Seabees battalion, developed a case definition of Gulf War-related neurologic dysfunction (6 syndrome variants), demonstrated that cases satisfying the ca se definition had organic neurologic dysfunction compared with matched controls, conducted a furt her case-control analysis showing that the cases were more likely (RR 4-8) than controls to report wartime exposure to being present during a chemical weapons alarm, being present near Khafji on January 19 or 20, 1991, having advanced adverse reactions to pyridostigmine bromide, using large amounts of government-issue insect repellant, wearing pet tick and flea collars, and working as a security guard. These findings supported the theory that the Gulf War-related neurologic syndrome was caused by exposure to combinations of organophosphate-like chemicals in the war. 2. We designed experiments to test this theory in hens, carried them out in collaboration with Du ke and Kansas State Universities and EPA, and demonstrated that combinations of DEET, pyridostigmine, permethrin, and chlorpyrifos act synergistically to cause del ayed, chronic neurotoxicity. 3. Completed a study of the neuropsychologic evidence of organi c brain dysfunction in ill Gulf War veterans. 4. Completed a study of the audiovestibular evidence of brains tem dysfunction in ill Gulf War veterans. 5. Conducted a literature review of 19 published repo rts of posttraumatic stress disorder in Gulf War veterans demonstrating that the apparent preval ence of PTSD was entirely due to errors in measurement and that there is no basis for the contention that Gulf War veterans are ill from PTSD and combat stress. 6. Reanalyzed the evidenc e in three epidemiologic studies comparing the prevalence of mortality, hospitalization and birth defects in deployed versus nondeployed Gulf War-era populations and demonstrated that the original conclusions of no war-attributable effects were due to bias from incorrect calculation of confidence intervals, selection bias from the \"healthy-warrior effects,\" and selection bias from incomplete followup of veterans who separated from the service.

Completion (CY): 1998 OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: To determine the reliability of three tests for Mycoplasma fermentans (incognitus strain) in human pure blood mononuclear cells, \"usual\" polymerase chain reaction procedure (UPCR), an optimized chelex polymerase chain reaction (OCPCR) procedure, and a nucleoprotein gene tracking (NGT) procedure. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) determine and compare the test -retest reliability of t he usual PCR, optimized PCR, and NGT procedures at a laboratory exper ienced in these testing procedures; and 2) determine and compare inter-lab reliability of the usual PCR, optimized PCR, and NGT procedures at four different laboratories. METHODOLOGY: 60 symptomatic Gulf War veterans (30 previously untested, 10 previously tested positive on UPCR, 10 previously tested negativ e on OCPCR, and 10 previously tested negative on NGT) will have blood drawn, aliquoted, and shipped overnight to 4 different laboratories for mycoplasmal testing. One of the labs, experienc ed in the 3 testing proc edures, will retest each subject. Each aliquot will receive a separate id entification code so that all labs are completely blinded as to what subject a given aliquot came from and whether any two aliquots are from the same subject. Cohen's Kappa will be used to determine t he rate of agreement for each test adjusting for chance agreement. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILEST ONES): Information pertaining to t he relative utility of these three mycoplasmal testing procedures. A manuscript summarizing the research will be submitted for peer-reviewed publication. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Participating labs were trained in the testing procedures to be used in the research. The protocol has completed external peer-review and internal institutional review board and human use committee reviews.

Completion (CY): 1999 Symptoms/General Health OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: This epidemiolog y study of morbidity and mortality outcomes of potential low-level exposure to chemical warfare agents at Khamisiyah, Iraq, and changes in the patterns of seeking health care following notification of possible exposure will be done at the request of the Department of the Army. Health outcomes and health care use patterns in the personnel of the two engineer battalions (approximately 1,000 indivi duals) will be compared with those of personnel of control engineer battalions. The study results have implications for the health and health care of other veterans of the Persian Gulf War. Specific objectives are to ascertain morbidity and mortality outcomes in active duty and former active duty soldiers using passive records-based methods and compare the outcome rates with controls with varying likelihood of having been exposed to chemical warfare agents. VA and DoD hospitalizations and outpatient data will be obtained. Patterns of health perception and health care use will be compared before and after notification of possible chemical warfare agent exposure. SPECIFIC AIMS: see objectives. METHODOLOGY: The study and control battalions will be selected in collaboration with DASG-HS-PM. The unit identifier codes (UIC) of t hese battalions will be used to identify individuals, using the rosters made available by the VA Environmental Epidemiology Service. Two battalions from the Khamisiyah site will form study group #1; two comparable battalions from within the 50 km circle surrounding Khamisiyah will constitute study group #2. Control group #1 will be selected from comparable battalions deployed to the PGW theater but were never within the 50 km circle; control group #2 will consist of comparable battalions not deployed to the PGW theater. The entire study and control populations are estimated to in clude approximately 5,000 to 7,000 individuals.

Completion (CY): 1998 OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: To assess t he prevalence of self-reported symptoms and illnesses among military personnel deployed during the Persian Gulf War and to compare the prevalence of these conditions with the prevalen ce among military personnel on active duty at the same time, but not deployed to the Persian Gulf. SPECIFIC AIMS: This study addres sed the following specific hypot heses: (1) Persian Gulf War (PGW) veterans experienced more self-reported health problems in the post-war period than did Persian Gulf-era military personnel who did not serve in the Persian Gulf region; (2) active duty military personnel with service in the Persian Gulf region experienced more self-reported health problems in the post war period than did active duty military personnel who did not serve in the Persian Gulf region; (3) National Guard and reserve personnel with service in the Persian Gulf region experienced more self-reported health problems in the post-war period than did National Guard and reserve personnel who did not serve in the Persi an Gulf region; and (4) National Guard and reserve personnel with service in the Persian Gulf r egion experienced more self-reported health problems than active duty military personnel with comparable service. METHODOLOGY: Data on self-reported health outco mes was collected through a telephone survey with a random sample of Persian Gulf War veterans and Persian Gulf War-era controls who listed Iowa as their home of record. Interviews were completed with 3,695 eligible study subjects (76%). EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES) : Initial report published in JAMA on January 15, 1997. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Initial results indicate that compared with non-PGW military personnel, PGW veterans report a significantly higher prevalence of symptoms of depression, PTSD, chronic fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, br onchitis, asthma, fibromyalgia, alcohol abuse, anxiety, sexual discomfort, and health related quality of life. Additional data analysis is ongoing. A protocol has been developed for collecting physica l exam data on a subset of the telephone survey participants to validate self-report of asthma. The protocol received OMB approval on 1/2/98. It is anticipated that data collection will begin in April. PUBLICATIONS: Iowa Persian Gulf Study Group.

Reeves, MD Research Focus: Symptoms/General Health Start Date (CY): 1994 Est. Completion (CY): 2000 Diagnosis OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: At request of VA, DoD, Pennsylvania Health Department, CDC investigators conducted an EPI-AID to evaluate re ported cluster of illness in the Pennsylvania 193rd Air National Guard. SPECIFIC AIMS: Characteri ze patients, determine if there was a cluster of illness, determine if the illness was unique to the 193rd ANG, related to residence in Pennsylvania, or related to PGW service, characterize the illness and derive a wo rking case definition, and identify risk factors for illness. METHODOLOGY: Stage 1 case series; stage 2 cross sectional population-based interview; stage 3 physical exam, psychometric testing, clinical la boratory, research laboratory assessment and nested case control study. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Field studies are complete. Preliminary report is published. Manuscript describing case definition, analysis of epidemiologic and infectious disease risk factors has been tentatively accepted pending satisfactory revision. Manuscript describing associations between deployment stressors and chronic multisymptom illness is in final stages of preparation. Collaborations are in place to provide serum spec imens to other Gulf War Illness investigators for testing and to participate in a prospective study of the cohort. Collaborations are also in place for multicenter factor analysis of symptom data. Fina lly, the illness we identified in this group of Gulf War (GW) veterans is similar to chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and specimens will be tested by techniques under development by the CFS program to identify unique infectious agents (not detected by usual protocols), evidence of i mmune stimulation, and neurotransmitters.

Completion (CY): 1998 Prevention OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: To compare PAH leve l in soil and air with biomarkers of exposure (urinary metabolites), biologically-effective dos e (DNA adducts) and individual susceptibility (genetic polymorphisms) for this group of 62 soldiers. This project is technically not a research project. It was an analysis requested by the U.S. Army Environmental Hygiene Agency, now known as the Center for Health Promotion and Preventive M edicine, as a part of their ongoing exposure assessments. SPECIFIC AIMS: To determine the extent of ex posure and the correlation between these various biomarkers. METHODLOGY: Soldiers participating in a USAEH A surveillance project in which ambient PAH monitoring and biomonitoring were performed. Samples of blood and urine were taken in Germany in June (1991), in August, eight weeks after deployment to Kuwait, and in October after the return to Germany. PAH-DNA adducts were measured by benzo[a]pyrene-DNA dissociation-enhanced lanthanide aromatic DNA adducts were 32P-postlabeling in blood cell DNA. Urinary ben zo[a]pyrene metabolites have been determined by PCR amplification of the DNA. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): The anticipated findings were higher pollution in Kuwait accompanied by higher levels of DNA adducts and urinary metabolites. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: By both methodologie s, blood cell DNA adduct measurements were lower in Kuwait than in Germany in June and October. The increase in adduct levels in October (compared to August in Kuwait) was stat istically significant. Levels of urinary 1-hydroxy-pyrene-glucuronide (--OH-PG) were al so lower in Kuwait than in Germany but the differences were not statistically significant. No di fferences in biomarker levels were associated with any metabolic polymorphism. The data suggest that the location of the soldiers' duty stations in Kuwait represented a cleaner working environmen t than Germany. Actual PAH measurements of air and soil in Kuwait showed very low levels of c ontamination. Literature values for ambient PAH measurements for Germany at the same time are much higher.

Barrett, Ph.D. Research Focus: Brain & Nervous System Start Date (CY): 1997 Est. Completion (CY): 2000 Symptoms/General Health OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: 1) Delineation of a neuroanatomical/neurophysiological basis, if any, for the reported cognitive dysfunction in some Gulf War veterans; 2) Delineation of symptom patterns shown by some individuals who served in the Gulf War; and 3) verification of research findings in an independent cohort of soldiers w ho served in the Gulf shortly after cessation of hostilities. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) Examine diffe rences in degree of activation present on fMRI scans in specific neuroanatomical regions within the frontal l obe, particularly the cingulate gyrus area and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, in Gulf War veterans challenged with a test of working memory; 2) Use a mathematical technique of Logical Analysis of Data (LAD) to analyze the relationships of symptom responses in Gulf-deployed and non-Gulf-deployed subjects; and 3) Replicate symptom prevalence comparisons and neuropsychological tests in a Danish cohort of Gulf-deployed and non-Gulf-deployed soldiers. METHODOLOGY: 1) Both conventional MRI and functional imaging will be used to assess changes in brain activation, to examine symptom profile, and to examine the relationship between functional activation and clinical state. Subjects will be selected from an ongoing Boston Environmental Hazards Center study of ne uropsychological function and will include 40 high-symptom Gulf-deployed veterans, 40-low-symptom Gulf-deployed veterans, and 40 Germany-deployed veterans. 2) LAD will be used to examine previously collected symptom data from Gulf-deployed and Germany-deployed veterans (n=300) to see if there is a set of complaints characteristic of service in the Gulf region useful for determining etiology or for case definition. 3) Neuropsychological test results and symptom prevalence measures will be r eplicated and verified in a cohort of Danish armed forces. Neuropsychological function and symptom prevalence of Danish troops deployed to the Gulf (n=200) will be compared with non-deployed Danish troops (n=200).

Research s: Date (CY): 1997 Est. Completion (CY): 2000 Symptoms/General Health OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: To characterize and compare alternative classifications for symptoms and functional disability which remain medically unexplained in Gulf War veterans. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) Phase I - To assess persistence and stability of symptoms over time, as well as to compare the performance of data-driven case definitions derived from two samples: the New Jersey Center for Environmental Hazards Resear ch (NJCEHR) sample of Department of Veterans Affairs Gulf War Veterans Registry participants and a CDC Air Force cohort. Standard definitions for medically unexplained symptoms will also be ev aluated; 2) Phase 2 - To assess generalizability of derived and existing case definitions in a random sample of deployed and non-deployed Gulf War era veterans; 3) To assess ps ychiatric distress among Phase I and Phase II participants at risk for having a psychiatric diagnosis. METHODOLOGY: All subjects from the previous ly studied NJCEHR cohort (N= 1,161) and a sample of the CDC Air Force cohort (N= 1,400) will be administered a symptom questionnaire. The stability of symptoms will be assessed by comparing the previous assessment of symptoms (Time 1) with the current assessment (Time 2). Case definitions derived using factor analytic procedures with Time 1 data will be compared to case definitions derived using Time 2 data. Generalizability of the case definitions will be determined by administeri ng the symptom questionnaire on a new randomly selected national sample of Gulf War veterans and era controls (N=3,000). A standardized telephone interview will be used to assess psychiatric conditions on a sample of Phase I and Phase II participants who are identified by the symptom questionnaire as having high levels of psychologic distress (number of subjects not to exceed 600).

Research Focus: Mortality Start Date (CY): 1996 Est. Completion (CY): 1998 OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: VA's Environm ental Epidemiology Service is undertaking a retrospective follow-up mortality st udy of Persian Gulf veterans that will compare the overall mortality rates and cause-specific mortality rate of all 697,000 servicemembers who served in the Persian Gulf theater of operations anytime between Augus t 1990 and May 1991 with those of a comparison group of 803,526 service members randomly selected from various subsets of all servicemembers who were in service anytime between August 1990 and May 1991 but who were not deployed to the Persian Gulf theater. SPECIFIC AIMS: Are there excess deaths among Persian Gulf veterans from various natural and external causes in comparison to their non-Persian Gulf veteran counterparts? METHODOLOGY: 800,000 controls; Cox regression model, SMR analysis. Vital status has been determined using a VA database known as the Beneficiary Identification and Record Locator Subsystem (BIRLS) and a Social Security Administration file for deaths reported through December 1995. Death certificates have been requested from VA regional offices, Federal Record s Centers or from state vital statistics offices. Cause of death are coded by a qualified nosologist using the International Clas sification of Diseases, 9th revision, without the knowledge of whether the decedent served in the Persian Gulf area. As the first mortality follow-up of Persian Gulf ve terans, this study represents an important first step in addressing the health concerns of Persian Gulf veterans. The study results as reflected in mortality should provide an early warning for any possible life threatening health conditions as a consequency of Persian Gulf service. The study will be periodically updated to ascertain any long-term consequences of Persian Gulf service on mortality outcomes. EXPECTED PROEJCTS (MILESTONES): Data collec tion is complete. Pre liminary results were presented at the 125th Annual APHA meeting in November 1997. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: The original study indi cates that the overall mortality rate is higher in Persian Gulf veterans compared to non-deployed era veterans. However, when causes due to accident, suicide and homicide are accounted for, there is no difference in mortality rate between the two groups. The updated mortality follow-up through December 1995 continues to show that excess mortality in Gulf veterans are due to ex ternal causes. This study will be periodically updated to ascertain any long-term consequence of Persian Gulf service on mortality outcomes. PUBLICATIONS: Kang H, Bullman TA.

Completion (CY): 1999 Symptoms/General Health OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: The primary focus of this research project is to determine whether specific cognitive deficits or deficit patterns are associated with the presence of self-reported health complaints and/or with hazardous environmental exposures in the Gulf. (Exposure information will be obtained either fr om self-report, exposure modeling, and DoD data on troop locations). In examining these associ ations, the influence of war-zone stress, PTSD symptomatology, psychological distress, and po st-deployment life stress ors is being evaluated. SPECIFIC AIMS: The specific objectives of this study are: (1) to observ e and determine whether cognitive performance deficits are associated wi th self-reported health complaints stemming from Persian Gulf deployment; (2) to determine the rela tionship of environmental exposure (self-report and based on an independent exposure protocol) during deployment to cognitive performance; (3) to characterize subsets of cognitive patterns or deficits among exposure classes; (4) to delineate the association of cognitive alterations or deficits wi th levels of combat exposure, combat stress, and PTSD symptomatology; and (5) to conduct a preliminary examination of the relationship among health symptoms, hazardous environmental exposure, and other war-zone experiences, specifically traumatic war-time stressors and ensuing trauma symptomatology (Sutker, Uddo, Brailey, & Allain,1993; Wolfe, press). Identification of diagno stic predictors and their relationship to outcomes of interest will help establish preliminary models related to important components of the military experience. The dev elopment of these models will aid Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (D oD) activities related to veterans' health care by: (1) facilitating symptom reco gnition and diagnosis in areas of growing co ncern (environmental exposure and traumatic stress following war), (2) emphasizing interdisciplinary approaches, (3) contributing to treatment planning, and (4) provid ing a baseline against which cognitive and mental status change over time can be gauged. Observat ions and findings from this study can lead to more focused investigation of cognitive functions that may be directly associated with defined exposures and/or PTSD symptomatology. METHODOLOGY: Subjects in this face-to-fa ce study are contacted by phone and asked to participate in as many parts of the protocol as t hey would like. The protocol consists of an in-depth questionnaire which asks about background informat ion relating to job, education, family history, medical and psychological problems, an interview with an Environmental Health specialist about experiences and exposures while in the Gulf, a psychological interview with a clinical psychologist asking about readjustment issues and psychiatric st ress since the war, and neuropsychological tests examining primarily memory, a ttention, and learning abilities. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): Multiple scientific manuscri pts, annual r eports, annual reports of Boston Environmental Hazards C enter, longitudinal data on stress and health. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: We completed the da ta collection phase of Project #1in the Fall of 1996. A total of 220 subjects from a stratified, random sampling from the larger Devens cohort participated. In addition, 73 PGW veterans from the New Orleans area (in collaboration with Drs. Pat Sutker and Jennifer Vasterling); and 50 controls (veterans deployed to Germany but not the Gulf) have completed the Project #1 protocol. Cleaning and merging all the Project #1 data has been completed and data analyses and manuscript writing are in progress. Analyses of health symptom reporting by the Devens, New Orleans, and Germany-deployed subjects have been carried out specifically examining the effect of self-reported environmental exposure on health symptom reporting, controlling for war-zone exposures and traumatic stress. A manuscript ha s been written describing these results and it has been submitted for consideration for publication. In addition, a \"Letter to the Editor\" to the American Journal of Epidemiology (in response to a recent article by Dr. Haley about PTSD) has been accepted for publication and is in press. Severa l other manuscripts are in progress (topics include: neuropsychological test performance, PTSD and ps ychiatric status, and expos ure assessment). (A paper describing health symptom reporting in the De vens cohort at Time 2 was recently published in the American Journal of Industrial Medicine.) In order to substantiate and corroborate informat ion reported to us by veterans regarding potential hazardous exposures in the Gulf, we are workin g on incorporating all the collected epidemiological data into a Geographic Information System (GIS) form at so that temporal and spatial characteristics can be modeled and integrated into data analytic pr ocedures. We are also working with the US Army's Center for Health Promotion and Preventative Medicine (CHPPM) and the US Army's Center for Research of Unit Records (RUR) to incorporate some of their information on oil fire smoke exposure estimates and unit-level troop locations into our analyses. When we have worked out the technical issues regarding modeling location information, we will conduct analyses to compare individual troop location and exposure information fr om our study subjects to information contained in the RUR computer database for our particular uni ts of study and their effect on health symptom patterns, neuropsychological test performance, and psychological stress.

Completion (CY): 1999 Symptoms/General Health OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: This study evaluate s neurological functioning in returning Persian Gulf War (PGW) veterans using clinical ex aminations and neuroimaging techniques capable of detecting subtle changes in central nervous system functioning (functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI]). The following study description reflects a change from the original proposal. SPECIFIC AIMS: The specific objectives of this study are: (1) to objectively describe Persian Gulf War veterans' neurological status using standard c linical methodology, (2) to observe and determine patterns of central nervous syst em dysfunction in PGW veterans and PGW-era veterans and (3) to explore whether similar patterns of particular ex posure characteristics exist within the groups and whether distinct patterns exist between the groups. METHODOLOGY: Subjects for clinical neurological exams are veterans from the subjects evaluated in Project 1. These subjects are also being examined as part of the laboratory and pulmonary function study in Project #4, VA-4D. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES) : In this study, we expect to determine if there are differences in subtle neurological function ing between PGW veterans and PGW-era veterans. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Fifty subjects have u ndergone neurological exams. Pilot functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies are curr ently in progress. This past year has been devoted to establishing the paradigms and setting up the equipment necessary to perform and analyze the functional imaging studies, as well as to begin scanning normal controls. Preliminary neuropsychological testing (from Project #1) has revealed several areas of behavior where these subject groups differ from normal controls. O ne of those areas is working memory. We have therefore created a visual working memory task t hat can be used for fMRI studies. In addition, we will examine motor function (Finger Tapping) and a ttention (Continuous Performance Test) in fMRI studies. We have also completed the computer programs necessary to analyze the fMRI imaging studies. In the summer of 1997, we submitted a grant appl ication to establish a collaborative agreement project with CDC in which we used the preliminar y information collected on fMRI (described above) and the work done on establishing the test paradi gms to enlarge the scope of the above described fMRI project. This new study project was funded on November 1, 1997 (for 3 years). Thus, the fMRI work will now be incorporated into the new CDC grant's scope.

SPECIFIC AIMS: 1. Monitor canc er incidence in Gulf War and Vietnam veterans of New England states, as part of the overall su rveillance of disease in veterans ex posed to environmental hazards; 2. Extend previous studies of cancer incidence and mortality by collecting and analyzing data on Massachusetts Vietnam veterans diagnosed in the years 1988-1993; 3. Analyze the results of the Massachusetts veterans cancer incidence linka ge in a nested case-control design incorporating information on military and civilian occupations, br anch of service and, where possible, location of service; 4. Establish a roster of Gulf War veterans in New England states, with identifying information such as names, dates of birth, and social security numbers, resulting in a computer file of Gulf War veterans that can be used in future linkage studies examining cancer incidence and mortality from various diseases; 5. Provide a database from which to plan additional clinical and preventative interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality from targeted diseases. METHODOLOGY: In Year 1, we plan to initiate the linkage. In years 2-5, we plan to sort the cases into cancers of interest and other (auxiliary) ca ncers, analyze the data as a \"nested\" case-control study, and present odds ratios for specific cancers in Vietnam veterans compared with Vietnam-era veterans. Also in years 2-5, we pl an to devise a system for linking the roster of Gulf War veterans in the New England states with cancer registries in all states which have population-based data. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): In this study we expect to determine cancer incidence rates in Massachusetts Vietnam veterans for the pe riod 1988-1993. At completion of year 2 of the study, we expect to have preliminary results bas ed on analysis of this database. Results pertaining to cancer incidence in Gulf War veterans is not expected for 10 years or so due to the latency period in cancer development. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Dr. Cl app has recently completed his update of cancer incidence in Massachusetts Vietnam veterans compared to Vietnam-era veterans. This was done using methods described in a previously published study by Dr . Clapp and colleagues (Clapp et al. Intl. J. Epidemiol., 1991; 20:7-12). Findings were that of the 245 cancers in Vietnam veterans diagnosed between the ages of 35 and 64 during the years 1 988 to 1993, there were substantially increased numbers of nasal/nasopharyngeal cancer and oral cancer and smaller increases in other types of cancer. A Letter to the Editor to the International Journal of Epidemiology was published in June 1997. The method of doing surveillance of cancer in Vietnam veterans is planned for Gulf War veterans. The technique of linking the roster of Gulf War ve terans to State Cancer Registries were presented at a meeting of Central Cancer Registries in April 1997 and the plan to begin cancer surveillance will be developed and implemented in the coming years.

Persian Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Research Database - Project No VA-4D Title: Evaluation of Respiratory Dysfunction Among Gulf War Veterans Project #: VA-4D Agency: VA Study Location: VAMC Boston Project Status: Ongoing Research Type: Clinical Research P.I.: Lewis Pepper M.D. Research Focus: Environmental Toxicology Start Date (CY): 1994 Est. Completion (CY): 1999 Symptoms/General Health OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: To assess respirator y status in relation to exposure to oil fire pollution in Gulf War veterans and evaluate the relationship between measures of pulmonary dysfunction and respiratory symptoms and ex posure in subjects recruited for Project #1. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1. Create a cumulative personal exposure estimate for ea ch subject utilizing the U.S. Army Center for Health Promoti on and Preventive Medicine (USACHPPM) exposure assessment data for their unit combined with geogr aphic specific information which maps each unit's location in the Persian Gulf War theater; 2. Asse ss respiratory status using standardized respiratory questionnaire; 3. Assess respiratory function with physical examination and pulmonary function testing; 4. Assess pre-existing asthma risk with total serum IgE levels; 5. Assess non-specific bronchial responsiveness (BHR) as a measure of ea rly outcome and as a potential risk factor in the development of lung disease by using methacholine challenge testing (initiating in Year 2 of the study); 6. Examine possible predi ctors of respiratory function (pul monary function tests (PFT) and methacholine challenge test) using cumulative environmental exposure assessment variable, respiratory medical history, occupational histor y, and smoking status variables; 7. Develop a database from which to plan preventative interv entions to reduce morbidity and mortality from respiratory diseases. METHODOLOGY: Subjects will be ve terans from the subjects eval uated in Project 1. Each will complete a standardized respiratory questionnaire, systematic cardio-pulmonary physical exam, and pulmonary function testing. Spirometric measures will include forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV1/FVC in accordance with American Thoracic Society recommendations. Subject data will be adjus ted for age, height and gender and transformed to percentage predicted values using Knuds on predictive equations. Blood will be drawn by venapuncture at the time of the visit and total serum IgE, complete blood count and differential and quantitative immunoglobulin levels will be meas ured. Additional blood samples will be drawn and stored for future laboratory tests (e.g., DNA analyses, infectious diseases). Bronchial responsiveness will be determined via methacholine c hallenge testing starting in Year 2. Nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness has been suggested as a risk factor for, or an early event in the development of both acute and ch ronic occupational lung diseases. Occupational exposures to irritant substances at concentrations similar to the Gulf War exposures have been shown to cause airway hyperresponsiveness and it is believed t hat these exposures might be associated with the development of asthma. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES) : In this study, we expect to determine if there are differences in respiratory function (PFTs) in Gulf War veterans associated with cumulative personal exposure estimates obtained from exposure modeling by the U.S. Army Hy giene Agency. At the completion of Year 3 of the study, we expect to have preliminary results based on analyses of the data collected at that time. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: We have expanded the study protocol to include members of a unit in an air ambulance company who were activated and sent to Germany during the Gulf War during December 1990 through August 1991. This group was added as a comparison group as it was mobilized but not deployed to the Persian Gulf. It consists of medics, helicopter pilots, flight crews, mechanics, communications specialists, and adm inistrative support personnel whose intended mission was handling and transport of wounded US soldie rs evacuated from the Gulf. Due to low US military casualties, the unit assisted German civili an missions. Fifty subjec ts from this unit have participated in Project #1. In order to conduct the planned methacholine cha llenge testing, we have relocated the study test site to the Pulmonary Lab at Boston Medical Center. The relocation has resulted in a delay in starting up this phase of the study. At this time a total of 88 subjects have completed the pulmonary questionnaire and 65 have come in for pulmonary function testing (these subjects have also participated in Project #1). We plan to call these people back in to complete the study with the methacholine challenge testing. Recruitment of study subjects who will receive methacholine challenge as well as conventional pulmonary functi on testing, physical exam, and blood tests was initiated in January 1998. PUBLICATIONS: none to date Persian Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Research Database - Project No VA-4E Title: The Aromatic Hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) as a Biomarker of Susceptibility Project #: VA-4E Agency: VA Study Location: Boston Basic Research P.I.: David Sherr, Ph.D. Research Focus: Environmental Toxicology Start Date (CY): 1994 Est. Completion (CY): 1999 Prevention OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: The objective of th is project is to test the hypothesis that the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a molecu lar biomarker for polycycli c aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) susceptibility. Veterans of the Persian Gu lf war were potentially exposed to relatively high doses of PAHs in smoke emanating from Kuwaiti oil well fires. The high incidence of physical complaints by Gulf War veterans may reflec t previously documented PAH toxicities including suppression of the immune system and neurologic dysfunction. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1. Confirm that AhR expression levels correlate with PAH bioactivity; 2. Optimize the use of single strand conformational pol ymorphism (SSCP) analysis to detect AhR gene polymorphism and mutations in mice; 3. Apply results to human studies. Results obtained in the fulfillment of aims #1 and 2 will define the conditions for employing AhR levels and gene polymorphism as molecular bi omarkers of PAH susceptibility. METHODOLOGY: The first aim of the project is to co nfirm that the level of AhR in mice correlates with PAH toxicity and carcinogenicity. To do th is first we propose genetically engineering AhR transgenic mice in which elevated AhR expression is directed to lymphocytes and then assessing a) PAH-induced immunosuppression as a representati ve indicator of organ toxicity and b) lymphocyte and lung transformation as measures of cancer risk in AhR transgenic mice. To prepare for human studies, we will evaluate AhR polymorphism in mice using single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Double stranded DNA from samples of veterans' blood is separated by heating followed by rapid co oling on ice. The three-dimensional conformation reassumed by each strand is determined by its nucleic acid sequence. Single nucleotide changes can be detected when the reannealed DNA is run on 6% acrylamide gels. To apply results to humans, polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to human AhR (and/or ARNT) will be produced and employed in conventional or PCR-based enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assays (ELISA) of AhR protein levels in peripheral bloo d lymphocytes from Persian Gulf War veterans who complete Projects #1 and 4. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): Th is project will result in the production of new strains of mice which differ in their resp onsiveness to environmental pollut ants. These mice will represent invaluable tools in investigating the effects of t hese pollutants in humans. We will also develop the technology to screen veterans of the Persian Gulf war for genetic factors which could put them at risk for immune defects and cancer. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: The primary goal of ai m # 1 is to develop mutant mice that express various levels of AhR. We have now successfully established an AhR knock out mouse colony and are evaluating the effects of PAH on bonemarrow st romal cells, preB cells and the thymic epithelial cells isolated from these mice. The results obtai ned so far provide evidenc e that AhR expression and activation are essential for PAH-induced cell death by apoptosis in preB cells grown over the stromal cells. This mouse line will be furt her helpful in deciphering the role of other molecules/signals involved in the PAH-induced apoptosis of lymphocytes. These studies will involve the analysis of the expression and activation of the transcription fa ctors and oncogenes known to be regulated by AhR activation. We have also generated the AhR transgenic mouse line, in which full length AhR is expressed at higher levels in lymphoid tissues. This was done by subcloning the whole AhR reading frame into an expression vector containing IgH enhancer (Em) and promoter (Pm) elements. 2 founder lines are positive for AhR transgene as detected by Sout hern blotting and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. We have also performed the analysis fo r the AhR expression at the protein level in the lymphoid tissues (e.g., thymus and spleen) in the southern/PCR transgene-positive litters and compared that with wild type litters either from t he same litter batch or from animals outside of this line. Immunoblotting results show Southern/PCR tran sgene-positive litters express high levels of AhR in their thymus and spleen as compared to wild type litters of the same age and background. These mouse lines will be used to confirm the role of AhR in PAH-induced immunotoxity and the effect of AhR hyper expression on the expression and activation of signal molecules involved in the PAH-induced immunotoxicity. The results obtained from the AhR transgenic mice will be compared with those of AhR knock out mice to give us a better understanding of AhR bioactivity. Specific aim #3 was to identify human AhR gene polymorphisms in the functional domains of the DNA binding (bHLH) and AhR-ligand binding (PAS) domain. Two polymorphic forms were detected in the bHLH domain by SSCP analysis. Sequencing revealed one of the polymorphic forms has several changes in this region, but interestingly, none of these changes resulted in any amino acid variation indicating the conservative nature of the DNA binding sequence of AhR. By contrast, multiple forms of the AhR PAS domain were obse rved and DNA sequencing revealed five nucleotide changes in the human AhR. Four of these five muta tions resulted in changed codons giving rise to multiple alleles in this domain. Some of the alle les represent significant amino acid changes. Unlike significant poymorphisms in mouse AhR, we did not detect any length polymorphisms in the human AhR. As a next step, DNA fragments will be cl oned into the human AhR expression vector obtained from Dr. C. Bradfield. The chimeric vectors will be transfected into AhRnull or AhR defective cell lines and tested for their responsiveness to AhR li gands (e.g., TCDD or PAH). For this purpose we have already standardized the AhR binding assays using the highly sensitive radioisotope analysis of the sucrose gradient fractions of AhR ligand C, Faller D. of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor is regulated by serum and mitogenic growth factors in murine 3T3 fibroblasts. 1996.

Persian Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Research Database - Project No VA-4F Title: Validity of Computerized Tests Project #: VA-4F Agency: Study Location: VAMC Boston Project Roberta White, Ph.D. Resear ch Focus: Brain & Nervous System Start Date (CY): 1994 Est. Completion (CY): 1999 Diagnosis OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: The objective of th is project is to continue the validation process of the Neurobehavioral Evaluation System (NES), a battery of computer-a ssisted behavioral tests developed for the purpose of detecting brain dysfunction secondary to ex posure to neurotoxicants, with an expanded battery of subtests. The NES tests are derived from standard neuropsychological tests that have been well characterized in terms of brain-behavior relationships, but differ in input and output modality and in other respects from traditi onal tests. Therefore, the validity of the NES subtests can only be verified by testing patient s with known brain damage and showing that such damage affects performance on those tests. The sensitivity of the NES to neurotoxicant exposure cannot be fully interpreted, in terms of CNS mec hanisms, without such validation. Because separate funding was received for a wide scale validity st udy of the NES3 (HSR&D Cooperative Study #29, PI: Roberta F. White, Ph.D.), th is project has been curtailed to included one especially relevant clinical group for effects of toxicants, patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD). This reflects a change from the original proposal. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1. Assess the validity of the ex panded battery of NES tests within a patient group with Parkinson's Disease) studied in the previous pha se of this study. 2. Correlate performance on the new NES subtests with performance on the st andard paper-and-pencil tests on which they are based. 3. Determine the sensitivity of the NES subtests to the progression of neurologic disease by longitudinal testing of PD patients. METHODOLOGY: Subjects are being recruited fr om both the Boston VAMC and Boston University Medical Center. Each subject will have an initial interview to provide dem ographic data followed by administration of the Mini-Mental Status Ex amination and WAIS-R Information and Picture Completion subtests (40 minutes). Subjects meet ing inclusion criteria will then be administered the expanded NES battery (approximately 100 minutes). EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES) : This study has important clinical and research implications: (1) to facilitate the assessment of pat ients with suspected subtle brain damage secondary to exposure from neurotox icants by providing a sensitive, relatively brief battery of tests of CNS function that can be easily administered; (2) to provide a test battery for which brain-behavior relationships are known (providing measures which will be useful in hypothesis-driven research on the cerebral localization of neurotoxicant effects) ; (3) to provide tests with known diagnostic validity for application to clinical situations. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Data analysis a nd manuscript writing have proceeded describing the validity of NES2 in various patient groups. Two papers have been written and published. The NES3 battery fully has been developed. Subject recrui tment is anticipated to start in Winter 1998. PUBLICATIONS: Krengel M, White RF, Diamond R, Letz R, Cyrus P, Durso R.

Completion (CY): 1998 OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: To survey 2800 Pe rsian Gulf War registry veterans randomly sampled from the Northeast quadrant of the U.S. to determine risk factors and their relationships to symptom clusters that could represent si gnificant health problems for Gulf veterans. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1. To provide health and medical histories of registry vete rans who served in the Persian Gulf; 2. To characterize the medical and combat experiences of these veterans during the Gulf war; 3. To perform case control comparis ons for various categories and combinations of symptoms with respect to individual and environmental risk factors identified in Aims 1 and 2. METHODOLOGY: The survey was mailed from Envi ronmental Epidemal Service to veterans who served in the Gulf. This survey was mailed to 2800 veterans on the Persian Gulf Registry, including 1,935 selected at random from the registry. This survey includes a symptom checklist, an environmental risk factor survey, a family and social support survey, and anxiety and depression scales. Multivariate analysis of the resulting information will include cluster analysis, principal components factor analysis, and multidimensional sc aling. From these analyses we expect to be able to develop one or more case definitions for the unexplained illnesses afflicting Persian Gulf veterans. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): We have found a high prevalence of Chronic Fatigue and Chemical Sensitivity among registry veterans. We also expect to delineate a series of risk factors for the development of these illnes ses, and for Post-traumatic Stress Disorder which may cluster with one or both of these illnesses. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Data collection is complete. We have received 60% of our questionnaires back, including 1,161 (60%) fr om the random group. Symptom data has been preliminarily analyzed. The mean number of endorsed symptoms out of 48 total was 24, with headaches, difficulty remembering, and fatigue bei ng the most bothersome. Factor analysis has identified five factors that characterized those in poor health and a preliminary definition has been presented. Confirmatory factor analyses are no w being done, and case control analyses will follow. PUBLICATIONS: Self-reported health status and exposure among Gulf war registry veterans.

Persian Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Research Database - Project No VA-5B Title: Physiological and Psychological Assessments of Persian Gulf Veterans Project #: VA-5B Agency: VA St udy Location: VAMC East Orange Status: Ongoing Research Type: Clinical Research P.I.: Benjamin Natelson, M.D. Research Focus: Immunology Start Date (CY): 1994 Est. Completion (CY): 1998 Brain & Nervous System OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: This project will determine if some of the unexplained medical illnesses in Persian Gulf veterans may be similar to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) or Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS) in civilian populat ions. It will include viral/immunological studies, neuropsychological studies, and studi es of physiological response s to a number of physical and cognitive challenges. A series of psychosocial factors will be evaluated to determine whether they are risk factors for the illnes ses suffered by these veterans. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1. To determine whether viral or cytokine patterns may suggest an infectious agent as a cause of illness in Persian Gulf veterans; 2. To determine if these veterans suffer chronic fatigue or chemical sensitivity; 3. To determine psychosocial risk factors that might have predisposed some veterans to develop their medical problems; 4. To determine if there are neuropsychological deficits in Persian Gulf veterans; 5. To determine if these veterans have abnormal physiological responses to physiological and cognitive challenges. METHODOLOGY: Persian Gulf veterans who have ch ronic fatigue, chemical sensitivity, or a combination of these and healthy control veterans are recruited for these studies. Blood samples are drawn, peripheral lymphocytes are isolated, and polymerase chain reactions are used to quantify herpes, epstein-barr and other viruses and to asse ss the level of interleukins and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. The subjects fill out a series of psychosocial instruments and environmental exposure surveys. A battery of neuropsychological tests ar e given in conjunction with magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. To evaluate the poss ibility of early peripheral neuropathy, neurological evaluation is supplemented with test of threshold fo r fine touch in the distribution of the radial nerve in the hand using Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments. Finally, we perform comprehensive testing of autonomic nervous system function and evaluate the veteran's ability to respond appropriately to behavioral challenges. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTON ES): We expect a number of the unexplained illnesses in Persian Gulf veterans will be similar to CFS and MCS. Data on civilians with CFS suggest that some cytokines and some of the herpes viruses might be elevated. Our own data on civilians with CFS reveal neuropsychological deficits in memory tasks and occasional non-specific white matter changes in the MRI's. Finally, we expect abnormal responsiveness to some of the physiological stimuli, but it remains unclear whethe r there will be hyper- or hyporesponsiveness. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Persian Gulf vete rans seen here at the East Orange VA Medical Center were mailed a screening form to evaluate thei r suitability for entry into studies. Additional veterans from an epidemiological survey of 2,800 Persian Gulf veterans in the northeast United States have also been screened for entry into the studies in this project. As of 1/1/98, 166 subjects have been enrolled in our studies. After evaluation, a substantial number of veterans have fulfilled criteria for CFS, MCS, or CFS with MCS. At present, analyses have been completed for several studies and 15 manuscripts are currently in prepa ration. Results of our Psychological study suggest that the illness reported by all PG veterans can not simply be attributed to an underlying psychiatric disorder. Symptomatic veterans examined often had either no Axis I diagnosis or had the same diagnoses found in our healthy veteran comparison group. Thus, it is possible that PG veterans' complaints of fatigue, pain and chemical sensitiv ity may either be due to exposure of environmental toxins during their service in the Gulf or may be a somatic response to the stresses of combat. Neuropsychological comparisons between healthy PG veterans and PG veterans with fatiguing illness point to at least two areas of subtle cognitive impairment in Persian Gulf War Veterans: 1) Complex attention/information processing, and 2) simple att ention. Additionally, we completed an investigation examining disability and health related quality of lif e in Gulf War Veterans. Results from this study indicate that Gulf War veterans with fatiguing illness suffer from significant disability and functional decline. Those with a comorbid psychiatric illness suffer the most extensive disability. Tests of autonomic function indicated less responsive homeostatic reflexes, including reduced baroreceptor reflex sensitivity, in a pattern that indicated autonomic dysregulation invo lving sympathetic nervous system. When challenged to perform stressful cogni tive tasks (speech and arithmetic), veterans with CFS displayed significantly reduced blood pressure increases that were attributable to inadequate cardiac output. Interestingly, the most substantial hypotensive effect was in the subgroup of veterans with concurrent Axis 1 diagnosis. No significant differences were found during the cold pressor test -- an aversive sensory stressor. Hyporesponsive ness to cognitive but not to sensory stressors suggests a possible disease of brain areas inte rfacing high level cognitive processing and autonomic components of stress response.

Persian Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Research Database - Project No VA-5C Title: Effects of Exertion and Chemical Stress on Persian Gulf Veterans Project #: VA-5C Agency: VA St udy Location: VAMC East Orange Project Status: Ongoing Research Type: Clinical Research P.I.: Nancy Fiedler, Ph.D. Research Focus: Immunology Start Date (CY): 1997 Est. Completion (CY): 1999 Symptoms/General Health Environmental Toxicology OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: The first part of this project will examine the effect of controlled chemical exposure and psychological stress on symptoms and psychophysiologic and cognitive performance of Persian Gulf veterans previously diagnosed with fatiguing illness. Research in our Center found that relative to healthy veterans, PG veterans with fatiguing illness reported significantly more combat exposure, illness in response to chemical exposures such as diesel exhaust and greater levels of negative affect and defensiveness. Therefore, this study will test the effects of each of these variables in a controlled study. The purp ose of the second part of this project will be to investigate the acute effects of exhaustive exercise on the cognitive abilities and the cardiovascular responses to autonomic stressors in Persian Gulf veterans diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). To date our data have indicate d impaired cognitive functioning and evidence of abnormal cardiovascular reactivity to various l aboratory stressors in veterans with CFS when compared to healthy veterans. Also a significant number of the fatigued veterans have indicated extreme fatigue and worsening of symptoms after even moderate physical exertion. An additional variable which will be examined will be cardiopulmonar y fitness. In this area we have preliminary data from project VA-5B which indicate a reduced pulm onary function in veterans with CFS, especially those who had indicated that they became sick w hen exposed to smoke from oil fires in the Gulf War. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1)To assess the effect of exposure to diesel fu mes and psychological stress in the following PG veteran assess the e ffect of exhaustive exercise on the cognitive abilities and cardiovascular response to autonomic stress ors of PG veterans with CFS and healthy PG veterans. METHODOLOGY: Veterans who were previously evaluated at our Cent er will be recruited. Each veteran will undergo a complete physical and psychiat ric examination. Veterans who meet criteria for one of the subject groups will participate in a single experimental session during which symptoms, psychophysiologic response (i.e., heart rate, blood pressure, respiration rate, end-tidal CO2, finger pulse volume, and skin conductance), and performance on a computerized vigilance task will be monitored in response to a rest period, followed by a psychological stressor (Stroop Color Word test), and exposure to 5 ppm diesel fumes. Blood and breath samples will confirm body burden of exposure. For the exhaustive ex ercise study, PG veterans with CFS and healthy PG veterans who were previously evaluated at our Center will be recr uited. The subjects will perform a cognitive test battery. Next they will perform a series of cardio vascular stressors (CVEVAL): 1) supine to standing, 2) Valsalva maneuver and 3) reaction time. In this CVEVAL session we will measure beat-by-beat blood pressure, ECG activity, respiration, and end ti dal CO2. After these sessions the subjects will perform a maximal aerobic capacity test on a bi ke ergometer (VO2max). During the VO2max test metabolic data will be measured breath-by-breath, lact ic acid will be assessed from finger stick blood samples, and muscle oxygenation will be evaluat ed by near infrared spectroscopy. Following the VO2max test the subjects will re peat the two pre- test sessions. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): The exposure study will deter mine the health effects of an acute exposure to an agent (i.e., diesel), reported by veterans with fatiguing illness, to have caused symptoms during service in the Gulf and presently. The study will also assess the differential contribution of personality variables and stress to subjective (i.e., symptoms) and objective (performance, physiology) indicators of health effe cts. Regarding the exer cise study, research has shown that the added stress of physical exerci se can in some cases expose autonomic problems when conventional test have failed. Also data in our civilian population with chronic fatigue have shown a decrease in cognitive abilities after physi cal exertion when compared to healthy controls. We may see similar results in this veteran population. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Recruitment of vete rans who meet subject criteria is ongoing. Exposure to petroleum products has been piloted in civilians and psychophysiologic data analytic routines are established. We expect to begin in March of 1998 when we will test two veterans per week. PUBLICATIONS: none to date Persian Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Research Database - Project No VA-5D Title: Effects of Genetics and Stress on Responses to Environmental Toxins Project #: VA-5D Agency: VA St udy Location: VAMC Orange Ongoing Research Comp letion (CY): 1997 Interactions OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: This project will determine whether genetic susceptibility to stress and exposure to chronic stress will result in persi stent sensitization to pot entially toxic effects of pyridostigmine bromide and aromatic hydrocarbo ns. In addition, it will examine the behavioral consequences of chronic exposure to these toxins. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) To expose Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats (stress- hyper responsive) and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (control) rats to chronic stress and then study the sensitivity to pyridostigmine bromide by measuring startle and neuroendocrine responses and the sensitivity to aromatic hydrocarbons by measuring the activity of hepatic enzymes induced to metabolize these compounds. 2) To treat WKY and SD rats ch ronically with these compounds and examine behavioral rhythms, temperature rh ythms, startle responsiveness, and neuroendocrine function (both basally and in response to stress). METHODOLOGY: SD and WKY rats will be treated with pyridostigmine bromide for 7 days and for the last 3 days will be subjected to a chronic st ress regime. 24 hours a fter the last stressor exposure, the neuroendocrine and brain c-fos responses to pyridostigmine bromide will be evaluated, as well as the levels of specific is ozymes of cytochrome P-450 in the liver. These enzymes are responsible for the metabolism of a large group of xenobiot ics, including aromatic hydrocarbons. The changes in these enzyme levels will also be evaluated follo wing stressor exposures and subsequent exposure to aromatic hy drocarbons. Similar st udies will determine the behavioral and some physiological effects of chr onic treatment with pyridostigmine bromide and aromatic hydrocarbons, as well as their effects on the responses to chronic stress. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): We expect that chronic stress will persistently increase the sensitivity to pyridostigmine bromide, which might explain how a drug that is used extensively in civilian populations might become toxic under the stresses of the battlefield. We also expect that this effect will be more pronounced in WKY rats, which would show that genetic predisposition might explain why some veterans developed unexplaine d illnesses and others did not. We expect that hepatic P-450 levels will be inhibited more in W KY rats, and that these resu lts could explain a greater sensitivity to toxins metabolized by these enzym es. Finally, we expect that chronic exposure to pyridostigmine bromide or aromatic hydrocarbons might show long-term effects on behavior or body temperature rhythms which could be very sensitive indices of chronic toxicity. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: We have been unable to validate the behavioral hyper responsiveness in WKY rats that has been reported by others. Preliminary data suggest that pyridostigmine bromide may cause a substantial decrease in voluntar y running activity in rats , but it is unclear as yet whether this could be a long-term effect. Howeve r, it is clear that WKY rats are more sensitive to some effects of pyridostigmine bromide than SD ra ts. For example, WKY rats show an exaggerated startle response 1 to 3 weeks after ending pyri dostigmine bromide treatment that is not present earlier and does not develop in SD rats. These resu lts have led to the current studies of interactions among strain, chronic stress, and potential pyri dostigmine bromide toxicity. This project was terminated in December 1997. Two manuscripts are in review and there are more being prepared. Continuation of this project has been funded under a VA Merit Review grant to Dr. Richard Servatius, that will start in April 1998.

Core Pr oject for Clinical and Epidemiology Research Project #: VA-6Core Agency: VA Study Location: VAMC Portland Project Epidemiology Research P.I.: Peter Spencer, Ph.D. Research Focus: Symptoms/General Health Start Date (CY): 1994 Est. Completion (CY): 1999 OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: To illuminate th e relationships between exposures (chemical, physical, stress) and unexplaine d illness in Gulf War veterans. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1. To define 'cas eness' of unexplained illness in Gu lf War veterans; 2. To develop a questionnaire of exposures and effects based on the results of veteran interviews and other relevant data; 3. To conduct a case-control st udy focused on the spatial-temporal relationship between exposures and illness; 4. To provide subjects for research conducted in Projects I (6A) and II (6B). METHODOLOGY: An epidemiological study using a population-based case-control design is being implemented. Pilot work was conducted in tw o phases before final determi nation of the research protocol. The first phase consisted of fourteen open-ended interviews with veterans with varying degrees of health and diverse military exposures. The interviews were completed in the Spring of 1995. The second phase of the pilot work was a feas ibility study in which a sample of 422 subjects, randomly chosen from a data tape of Oregon and Washington residents serving in the Persian Gulf, were mailed a survey describing the proposed plan for the large epidemiology study. Specifically, the researchers sought information on potential response rates and barriers to participation. Modifications of the planned research protocol were made based on responses of the feasibility study. The regional study consisted of mailing a questionnaire seeking information on exposures in the Gulf and current health status to approximately 3000 northwest PGW veterans. The data base used for the sampling frame was obtained from the DoD (Defense Manpower Data Center). The database contains the names/addresses of military personnel who were deployed to the Persian Gulf from August 1990 through July 1991, and who listed Oreg on or Washington as their home state-of-record. The accuracy of the addresses in the DoD dat abase was determined in the feasibility study. Arrangements were made with the Department of Veterans Affairs, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, and the Internal Revenue Service to track individuals with invalid addresses in the DoD file. In addition, we have utilized the services of Telematch, Equifax, Transunion and numerous Internet search engine s to assist in finding current addresses and telephone numbers. The questionnaire is mailed in stages based on geographic location of the potential subjects. The survey methodology was developed with the assistance of consultants. Females and veterans in specific deployment groups (pre-combat, comba t, post-combat) were over-sampled. From those who respond to the mailed questionnaire, potential cases and controls (total approximately 500) are recruited for the clinical case-control study. The mailing of the survey questionnaire began in mid-November 1995 and the case-control clinical evaluations began in January 1996. The working case definition determined at the co nclusion of the May 1995 Research Retreat (with input from our External Advisory Committee) is as follows: Must have at least one of the following signs or symptoms to be defined as a potential case of Persian Gulf War Unexplained Illness (PGWUI). Onset must be during or after deployment to the Persian Gulf. Symptoms must have persisted for one month or longer and have occurred during the three-month period preceding the proposed physical examination. -Muscle/joint pain -Cognitive changes including memory loss, confusi on, inability to concentrate, mood swings, and/or somnolence. -Diarrhea -Skin or mucous membrane lesions -Unexplained fatigue, plus at least four associated symptoms. Potential cases and controls receive a medical wo rkup at the Portland VAMC. Those participating in the clinical workup at the Portland VAMC also serve as the subjects in Projects I (VA-6A) and II (VA-6B). Multivariant analyses will be conducted to compare subjects with unexplained illness and healthy subjects with respect to reported and kn own exposures to specific environmental factors. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): Definition of associations, and the strength of those associations, between expo sures and unexplained illness. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: 1.Open-ended interv iews of PGW veterans have been completed, transcribed, and summarized. Information gleaned from the interviews was incorporated in the questionnaire content. 2.Feasibility study complete d on 422 randomly selected Oregon veterans in the population to be studied. Changes in the design were implemented as a result of the findings: A. Compensation of $10 is given to all subjec ts who complete and return the mailed survey questionnaire. B. The first year of survey mailing focused on residents of Oregon. Initial mailing was to subjects randomly selected within a 50-mile radius of Portland. Subsequent mailings were done to different geographic areas of the State of Oregon. The final survey sampling will be representative of the geographic distribution of all potential subj ects in the data base obtained from the DoD. C. The mailing of questionnaires to potential subjects in areas outside of Portland, Oregon coincided with the negotiation of clinic space in VA facilitie s in outlying areas of the State. This change was needed because of the sizeable proportion of subjects in the feasibility study who reported that they would not participate in the planned study due to the traveling time to Portland VAMC. 3.Survey sampling plan for 1996-1998 is currently being implemented. Questionnaire returns are being scanned for data entry. Incomplete addresses are being tracked. As of December 1, 1997, 1982 questionnaires have been mailed to veterans who served in the PGW. Follow-up of the first two mailing waves (consisting of re-mailing questionn aires, telephone calls, and telephone-administered questionnaires) has been completed. A response rate of 58% has been achieved for the first six mailing waves. Follow-up for subsequent mailing wa ves is ongoing. 4.Clinical testing of subjects responding to mail survey began in January 1996. As of January, 1998, 409 subjects have been evaluated in the case-contro l study. Clinical testing will be comple ted in April 1998. 5.Mailings were made to 259 subjects living in rural areas of Oregon. In both April 1997 and June 1997, we completed four days of satellite clinical evaluation of 45 of the responders from this sample in cooperation with the Roseburg, Oregon, VAMC. In September and Decem ber 1997, we completed four days of satellite clinical evaluations of 33 of the responders from the Washington sample in cooperation with the American Lake VAMC in Tacoma, Washington. 6.Serum samples from PGWUI cases and controls are studied with an antibody-capture ELISA test whic h is being developed for the detection of exposure to/infection with Leishmania tropica. An initial batch of 200+ serum samples from cases (two-thirds) and controls contained approximately 10% that had valu es more than three standard deviations from the mean of negative controls. While these samples fell within the range of values obtained from sera obtained from subjects with cutaneous L. tropica infection (positive controls), the specificity and sensitivity of this test-under-development has yet to be established (see VA-6E). 7. Analyses have been completed in the following areas: Comparison of self-reported symptoms and symptoms reported at time of clinical evaluation; Reliability of self -reported exposure informatio n. 8. Analyses are in progress in the following areas: Prevalence of self-reported symptoms in survey responders; Prevalence of symptoms in veterans serving in specific deployment time periods; Association between self-reported symptoms and clinical findings with time of deployment; Association between self-reported symptoms/clinical findings and specific exposures that reportedly took place while in SW Asia.

Persian Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Research Database - Project No VA-6A Title: Psychosocial, Neuropsychological an d Neurobehavioral Agency: VA Study Location: VAMC Portland Project Type: Clinical Research P.I.: Kent Anger, Ph.D. Research Focus: Brain & Nervous System Start Date (CY): 1994 Est. Completion (CY): 1999 Symptoms/General Health OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: To determine if veterans have developed adverse neurobehavioral or psychological effects from servic e in the Persian Gulf War. If so, to determine the triggering events, including combat stressors, life stressors, chemical exposures, personality disorders, psychological health and motivation to seek compensation. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1. Determine if there are objec tive memory and attention deficits in Veterans reporting (unexplained) symptoms which developed during or since the Gulf War; 2. Determine the relationships between neurobehavioral and psychological measures and unexplained symptoms referable to the Gulf War; 3. Employ in- depth neuropsychological examinations to identify neurobehavioral, neuropsychological and psychosocia l factors that may explain or more fully characterize cognitive symptoms or objective cognitive deficits. METHODOLOGY: This project will determine if veterans of the 1991 Persian Gulf conflict have developed any of a broad range of adverse neur obehavioral or psychological health effects attributable to triggering events during their serv ice in the 1991 Gulf War. Hypothesized triggering events include combat or life stressors and chemical exposures. Potential factors that could contribute to or influence the presence of adverse health effects will be assessed and entered into the analysis, including personality disorders, psychological health, medical conditions, and motivation to seek compensation. Each veteran participating in the overall research program receives a screening assessment with a 4-hour battery of 18 standard, reliable and valid psychosocial, neuropsychological, and behavioral performance tests. The psychosocial and neur opsychological tests selected for the screening battery have been implemented in a user-friendly and consistent computer-administration format (Health Screening System) that does not require individual explanation for each test developed for this project. The neurobehavioral tests of attenti on, memory and coordination are implemented in the Behavioral Analysis and Research System (BARS), and two new tests (ODTP and Serial Digit Learning) were added to BARS for this project (Specific Aims 1 and 2). During the course of the study, up to 50 \"Cases\" and 50 \"Controls\" (from VA-6) or referents will receive an in-depth clinical (neuropsychological) interview to more fully characterize possible disorders (Specific Aim 3). In addition, those in itially demonstrating a high level of PTSD will be invited back after 1-2 years to repeat the tests to assess PTSD progression, resources permitting. Results are being analyzed, during data collection: (a) by experienced clinicians (neuropsychological exam; Specific Aim 3), (b) wi th multivariate techniques adjusted for confounders (neurobehavioral tests; Specific Aim 1), and (c) with principal components analysis, logistic hierarchical multiple regression, discriminant function analysis, latent growth models analysis, and structural equation modeling to characterize the nat ure of the psychosocial results (Specific Aim 2). EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES) : Develop a predictive model relating the occurrence of unexplained illness to chemical exposure, ps ychosocial, or neuropsychological factors. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Methods Developed or Modified for Project Twelve valid, reliable psychosocial and neuropsychological tests were selected for the screening battery in this project. They address the main psychological factors identified : PTSD EVALUATION - Penn Inventory for PTSD ; Mississippi PTSD Scale. PTSD Checklist. PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS - Beck Depression Inventory (BDI); Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI); Substance Abuse Subtle Screen Inventory (SASSI); Life Experience Scale (LES). PERSONALITY VULNERABILITY - Positive Affect Negative Affect Scale (PANAS); Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-II (MMPI- II). HEALTH SYMPTOMS - Health Status Questionnaire (SF-36); Hopkins Symptom Checklist (SCL-90R). WA R ZONE EXPERIENCE - Com bat Exposure Scale, revised (CES-r). A common presentation format was developed for the 12 diverse psychosocial and neuropsychological tests in order to improve acceptability and speed completion, using Supercard software for presentation on a Macintosh laptop co mputer. The new format includes a spoken test administration option (individually selectable and dese lectable at any point in testing) which has been digitally recorded for inclusion with the test pres entation system and options to navigate within a test to any question or to repeat the instructions. A training program was also developed to teach veterans to complete the questionnaires, and durab le external \"DataSled\" Response Units (developed in a separately-funded project) have been connect ed to the laptop computers on which the tests are being presented to up to 9 veterans simultaneously (number limited by space).The new testing format (HSS) was employed with 20 PGW veterans and 10 ci vilians in pilot evaluations of the prototype training program. Test subjects were very positive about the test ing system, and the mean questionnaire administration time approximated the ta rget of 3 hours in a part of that group (Kovera et al., 1996). Changes recommended by respondents were introduced into the HSS. These tests are now being administered to all veterans tested by the PEHRC Epidemiology/Medical Core unit. The neurobehavioral tests employed in this project were selected from the Behavioral Research and Assessment System (BARS): ATTENTION, MEMORY, and LEARNING - Symbol Digit, Digit Span (forward and backward), Selective Attention Test Serial Digit Learning; RESPONSE SPEED AND COORDINATION - Simple Reaction Time; MOTIVATION - Oregon Dual Task Procedure (ODTP) - (modelled after the Portland Digit Recognition Test [PDRT]). Most BARS tests were implemented under other fu nding to one of the project PIs (Anger), but the ODTP was prototyped and administered to pilot subjec ts for this project, including veterans involved in the psychosocial test development (above). T he duration of testing met the target time of 60 minutes. These tests are now being administered to all Veterans tested by the PEHRC Epidemiology/Medical Core unit. Reliability of Methods: During Summer, 1996, the 18 HSS and BARS tests used in this project were administered twice to 60 Oregonians, with one week between administrations, to evaluate their test-retest reliability. In general, reliability score s were comparable to those reported for t he tests in their original format. This supports the use of the tests in the new HSS and BARS format which allows testing of larger numbers of veterans due to the increased cost-effectiveness of this system. A manuscript describing these results has been submitted for publication. Website Describing HSS and BARS: In order to make the information about the methods used in this (and other) projects more widely available, a we bsite has been created that describes the tests, presents test-retest reliability data, provides a simulation of training for the HSS, and depicts one screen for each test. Home Pages were thus created for both BARS and HSS. Both Home Pages are accessed through http ://home.att.net/~angerk. Results of Case-Control Comparisons: HSS and BARS tests have been administered to 407 veterans as of December, 1997, as part of the PEHRC cl inical study (Specific Aims 1-2). The data have begun to reveal consistent and highly significant differences between cases and controls on most psychological test scales in the direction of in creased distress in case s (veterans with unexplained symptoms) and slowed response latencies on several neurobehavioral tests in cases compared to controls. Individual neuropsychological tests (Specific Aim 3) have been administered to approximately 45 people by Dr. Storzbach and, recently, Dr. Binder. These tests require scheduling a full day in the event that a diagnostic interview is required based on initial testing. This has slowed the process when last-minute schedule changes, cancellations, or no-shows effectively lose the one subject that can be scheduled for each week. Recruitment has been difficult to accomplish; most veterans are not interested in the tests and unable to absent themselves from their regular job.

Persian Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Research Database - Project No VA-6B Title: Clinical and Neuroendocrine Aspects of Fibromyalgia (Project II) Project #: VA-6B Agency: VA Study Location: VAMC Portland Project Status: Ongoing Research Type: Clinical Research P.I.: Robert Bennett, M.D. Research Focus: Immunology Start Date (CY): 1994 Est. Completion (CY): 1999 Symptoms/General Health OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Determine the rela tionship between exposures during the Persian Gulf War and the development of fibromyalgia. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1. Screen vete rans complaining of fatigue and musculoskeletal symptoms with previously developed and validated questionnaires a nd directed physical examinations to determine if fibromyalgia is present. 2. Correlate the presence or absence of fibr omyalgia with possible environmental exposures, as determined in the core part of this program, or with neuropsychological factors, as determined in Project I: Psychosocial, Neuropsychological and Neurobehavioral Assessment. 3. Evaluate a smaller group of veterans with fibromyalgia and an age and sex matched group of veterans without fibromyalgia, for the neuroendocrine abnormalities described in fibromyalgia. 4. Repeat the clinical and neuroendocrine testing on the veterans with fibromyalgia (objective 3) 24-30 months after initial evaluation. METHODOLOGY: Utilizing the cases determined in the case-control/epidem iological study, using validated methods, screen cases complaining of musculoskeletal complaints for fibromyalgia and controls without symptoms. Perform neur oendocrine testing on both cases and controls. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): 1. Determination of the association between exposure to the Persian Gulf War and the development of fibromyalgia; 2. Determine the prevalence of neuroendocrine findings in a primarily male sample; 3. Follow the course of the clinical/neuroendocrine findings with time. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Andr\u00e9 Barkhuizen MD , Assistant Professor of Rheumatology, is the focal clinician responsible for integrating the fi bromyalgia clinical study into the epidemiological case-control study. In addition to keeping abreast with national scientific work in the area of fibromyalgia and PGW veterans, preliminary work consisted of reviewing the Portland VA Persian Gulf War (PGW) Registry for cases of musculoskeletal pain. The prevalence of complaints in the Portland PGW Registry sample was 29.6% compared to the national registry prevalence of 13.9% and the DoD Comprehensive Clinical Evaluation Prot ocol reported prevalence of 47%. Results from a pilot population-based survey of 157 veterans eligible for our epidemiologic case-control study (see Project VA-6) indicated that the self-reported rate s of musculoskeletal pain in both female and male subjects were both 38%. Responders to the mailed survey who had regist ered in the PGW registry were two times more likely to report musculos keletal pain than responders who had not registered. Investigators worked closely with the epidemiologica l core in the development of the items to include in the survey questionnaire, telephone screening questions, and the history and physical examination to be done in the case-control study. Exclusio nary diagnoses were determined. The history and physical examination was pretested on three subjects with musculoskeletal pain in January 1996. Since commencing the Persian Gulf Research Clinic in January 1996, the majority of subjects has been evaluated by a single examiner for rheumato logical conditions. A blinded tender-point examination is performed followed by a full rheuma tology history and physical examination. The Core laboratory data, which include an erythrocyte sedi mentation rate, C-reactive protein, antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, hepatitis B, C, and human immunodeficiency virus serologies, and selected joint radiographs, are reviewed at the bimont hly Clinical Case Review meeting to arrive at a final rheumatological diagnosis. Thus far, of the 219 cases and controls (age= 32.4 + 7.9 years; 83% male) evaluated in our research clinic, 70% complained of musculoskeletal pain and were found to have (expressed as a percentage of the total clinic sample): me and overuse 4%. Nine percent of the subjects h ad musculo-skeletal pain that was unexplained and did not fall into the diagnostic cate gories listed above. Cases with fibromyalgia and unexplained musculoskeletal pain were much more likely than healthy controls to complain of abdominal cramps, muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, chest pain, restless legs, dry eyes, tender skin, cold intolerance, unrefreshed sleep, headaches or post-exertional pain. Cases with fibromyalgia or unexplained muscle and joint pai n scored significantly higher on the Beck Anxiety and Depression Inventory, SF 36 (sub-scales of pain, energy/fa tigue, physical function) and \"somatization\" sub-scales of the MMPI and SCL-90 when compared to healthy controls. Cases with fibromyalgia and unexplained muscle/joint pain re ported significantly more combat exposure and scored higher on post traumatic stress disorder scales (MISS, PENN, PCL C). The majority of subjects with musculoskeletal complaints wa s on no treatment and in full-time employment. Rheumatological laboratory investigations were normal in most subjects. The second component entails study of the neuroendocrine axis of the Persian Gulf veterans. All subjects attending the Persian Gulf Research Clinic are screened using the serum Insulin-like Growth Factor-I (IGF-1) and Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3 (IGFBP3) levels. This has previously been shown to be reduced in one-third of patients with fibromyalgia. In the current study, serum IGF-1 levels were not significantly different in subjects with unexplained muscle and joint pain (175.9+43.3), fibromyalgia (183.8 ng/ml+61.0), unex plained fatigue (193.4+59.9), or healthy i.e. For all cases and contro ls, IGF-1 levels symbol digit (R=-0. 2; p=0.004). There was no correlation between IGF-1 level and self-reported sleep disturbances , pain or scores for the fibromyalgia impact questionnaire. The final component involves evaluat ing changes in the neuroendocrine axis in greater detail. We aim to study 20 cases of fibromyalgia with low IGF-1 levels and 20 control subjects with normal IGF-1 levels over the next 2 years for an in-depth study of their hy pothalamic-pituitary-growth hormone and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The study protocol has been approved by a peer review committee of the Clinical Research Center , a dedicated research facility at the Oregon Health Sciences University, which is funded and regularly reviewed by scientists and clinicians from the National Institutes of Health. The laboratories of the Clinical Research Center and Oregon Graduate Institute perform half-hourly cortisol and growth ho rmone levels, a 24-hour cortisol production rate and two growth hormone stimulation tests. This will enable the research team to objectively document an altered neuroendocrine stress response and adult growth hormone deficiency in the symptomatic veterans. When testing on all subj ects is completed, the altered neuroendocrine stress response will be correlated with the neuropsychological profile and, par ticularly, with the stress scores collected by Project I. Finally, the stress response will be correlated with reported exposures to various environmental agents and the deployment periods of the veterans (see Project VA-6). To date, 10 cases and 4 controls have been studied, and an interi m statistical analysis will be performed midway through this component of the study (summer 1998). In view of the small number of controls studied to date, we compared the results of the cases to dat a on healthy civilian control available from a large ongoing study of our Endocrinology Consultant. Ther e seems to be a trend towards an elevated cortisol production rate in cases compared to healthy controls suggesting a chronic stress response (i.e. a chronically activated hypothalamic-p ituitary-adrenal axis). The growth hormone stimulation tests utilizing oral clonidine and intravenous L-arginine confir ms adult growth hormone deficiency (GH response < 5 ng/ml) in fibromyalgia cases with low IGF-1 levels. Because of insufficient numbers, we are unable to report on the diurnal secretory pattern of growth hormone and cortisol as measured in the half-hourly collection over 24 hours.

Persian Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Research Database - Project No VA-6C Title: Neurotoxicity of Environmental Pollutants and Warfare Agents (Project III) Project #: VA-6C Agency: VA Study Location: VAMC Research Bromide Start Date (CY): 1994 Est. Completion (CY): 1999 Environmental Toxicology OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the neurotoxic potential of a group of hydrocarbon solvents and the effects on cholinergic neurons of long-term exposure to pyridostigmine bromide (PB). SPECIFIC AIMS: 1. To evaluate effects of tigmine bromide (PB) on ch olinergic function in cerebellar and spinal cord explants. 2. To ident ify the cellular targets of neurotoxic hydrocarbon solvents. 3. To examine the relationship betwe en the chromogenic and neurotoxic properties of selected organic solvents. METHODOLOGY: Spinal cord-dorsal root ganglia (DRG )-muscle cultures derived from fetal mice are used to study to effects of chronic and acute ex posure to pyridostigmine on cholinergic function. Cerebellar cultures derived fr om newborn mice are used to study the relationship between chromogenic and neurotoxic properties of a group of monocyclic and dicyclic hydrocarbon solvents. The substances to which cultur es will be chronically exposed ar e directly incorporated into the culture medium. The dosage and duration of exposur e to pyridostigmine and each of the solvents will be experimentally determined. Morphological Analyses - Control and treated explant cultures will be stained with thionin (for Nissl substance). This stain allows the evaluation of the various neuronal cell groups present in explant cultures by light microscopy. Central and per ipheral myelination can be readily examined in the living state using bright field opt ics. Immunohistochemical staining will be used to identify alterations chan ges will be elucidated by electron microscopy. Electrophysiology - In spinal cord-DRG-muscle expl ants, extracellular electrodes are used to record dorsal horn, ventral horn and muscle responses evoked by extracellular st imulation of dorsal and ventral roots. In cerebellar cultures, neurons devel op spontaneous activity as they mature in vitro. Extracellular recordings are used to obtain single unit discharge rates and, in combination with extracellular stimulation, are used to assess the efficacy of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic circuitry. Intracellular electrodes are used to st udy the active and passive properties of individual neurons (motorneurons in the spinal cord cultures and Purkinje cells in cerebellar cultures) and their synaptic responses to afferent stim ulation and to record muscle activity. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES) : Electrophysiological and morphological characterization of the cellular neurotoxicity of selected hydrocarbon solvents and pyridostigmine bromide STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: We have completed an in vitro study of the effects of pyridostigmine bromide on the neuromuscular junction. Pyridostigmine bromide (PB) belongs to a group of chemicals classified as reversible inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of acetylcholine. During the 1991 Gu lf War, troops participating in Operation Desert Storm were issued PB in blister packs containing twenty-one 30-mg tablets. One tablet was to be taken every 8 hours when under threat of attack. Previous in vivo studies have reported the neurotoxic potential associated with high-dose acute and long-term anticholinesterase therapy. Administration of anticholinesterases in high do ses produced pronounced structural and functional alterations localized to the neuromuscular junction. The aim of this study was to determine whether long-term (1-2 weeks) exposure to low concentrations of PB (comparable to doses taken by Operation Desert Storm troops) affected neuromuscular function in a well characterized in vitro model. Organotypic spinal cord-dorsal root ganglion explant s co-cultured with skeletal muscle were used to evaluate the effects of long-term exposure to PB. No physiological or ultrastructural alterations were observed in dorsal root ganglia neurons or ventra l horn motoneurons with exposure to 10-6M PB for periods of up to three weeks in vitro. Neur omuscular function was selectively affected by PB treatment. Acute treatment (minutes) with PB incr eased spontaneous muscle contraction. This effect is consistent with the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and the consequent greater availability of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. Long-term treatment (days to weeks) with PB decreased the contractile activity of muscle fi bers and their sensitivity to externally applied acetylcholine. Ultrastructural examination of neuromuscular junctions in cultures exposed to PB revealed no evident structural changes after a 1- week exposure but, after a 2-week exposure, cystic degenerative changes were evident in the nerve terminals. The postjunctional folds displayed atrophic changes and were surrounded by vacuolar spaces. These changes are indicative of both nerve terminal degeneration and a subjunctional myopathy. Exposure to PB for 1 or 2 weeks even at low dosages produced early functional and later stru ctural alterations of the neuromuscular junction. In early stages, changes may be limited to desen sitization of the acetylc holine receptors produced by the persistence of acetylcholine in the synapt ic cleft, followed in later stages by degenerative changes of the neuromuscular junction. The resu lts of this study have recently been submitted for publication. We have also evaluated the neurological effects of t he other moiety of the PB molecule, the bromide anion. The bromide anion permeates chloride channels of cell membranes and, in contrast to pyridostigmine, readily diffuses across the blood-br ain barrier. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of bromide on neural activity. Cerebe llar explant cultures were exposed for a period of two weeks to 10-6 M of sodium bromide. N eural activity was subsequently evaluated by electrophysiological recordings. Exposure to micr omolar concentrations of bromide had no effect on the spontaneous activity of cerebellar neuron s. Additional studies s howed that a significant depression in cerebellar neural activity resulted only after substitution of sodium chloride in the nutrient media with a much higher concentration (20 mM) of sodium bromide. At this concentration, bromide has been shown to enha nce gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-activated currents in cultured cerebral neurons. The depressant effects of bromide on neural activity were reversed by incubation with standard saline solution. In 1998, the neurotoxic properties of representativ e examples of the class of aromatic hydrocarbon solvents will be studied for neurotoxic potential and effects.

Completion (CY): 1999 Chemical Weapons OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Determine the long-term consequences of genotoxin exposure on nervous system and non-nervous system tissue. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1. Determine the type and quantity of specific DNA adducts and the capacity to repair these adducts in control and nitrogen mustard (HN2) treated genomic DNA isolated from normal human skin and brain; 2. Determine the type and quantity of specific DNA adducts and the capacity to repair these adducts in genomic DNA isolated from mouse cerebral cortex cultures treated with HN2; 3. Assess the relationship between DNA damage, DNA repair and cell degeneration in rodent neuronal cultures treated wi th HN2; 4. Compare and contrast DNA damage, DNA repair and cytotoxicity in primary neuronal and primary glial cultures treated with HN2. METHODOLOGY: 1. Determine the relative sensitivit y of different nervous tissue cell types to HN2. Nervous tissue cell cultures (e.g., rodent astrocyt cells, cortical explants, and SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells) will be treated fo r various time periods with a range of HN2 concentrations and examined for cytotoxicity by using fluorescent dyes for live (e.g., the mitochondrial fluorochrome Rhodamine 123) and d ead (e.g., the nuclear DNA binding fluorochrome propidium iodide) cells. 2. Develop sensitiv e methods for the detection of DNA adducts (i.e., monofunctional and cross-links) in HN2 treated nervous tissue and human skin explants. The most sensitive methods for detecting HN2-induced DNA adducts and ethidium bromide as say method was developed and used to detect DNA adducts in tissue treated for periods up to 7 days with HN2. 3. Develop methods for determining DNA repair levels and activity in mustard treated neuronal (e.g., cortical, cerebellar) and non-neuronal (e.g., astrocytes) cultures and hum an skin. The predominant DNA adduct produced by sulfur and nitrogen mustards is the guanine DNA adduct. by the base-excision repair (BER ) pathway. The rate-limiting step in BER is the repair of an apurinic site by apurinic/apyrimidini c endonuclease (APE). APE levels and activity will be determined in nervous tissue treated with HN2. APE levels will be determined by western blotting and activity will be determined using damaged plasmid DNA . These studies will determine the relative DNA repair of HN2-induced DNA adducts in differ ent CNS cell types. Findings from these studies will be important for establishing a possible relationship between DNA damage, genotoxin exposure and cytotoxicity of nervous tissue. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): 1. Determination of whether mustard agents can induce persistent DNA damage to nervous tissue. 2. Development of sensitive techniques for the detection and quantitation of DNA adducts induced by mustards. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: 1. We began study of the response of neuronal and glial cells and human skin tissue to HN2. Human and rodent post mitotic neurons proved to be more sensitive to HN2 than glial cells. 2. We examined the acute (24 h) and long-term (7 day) cytotoxic effect of HN2 on human skin tissue (SKIN2tm). HN2 is acutely toxic to human skin tissue at high concentrations but extensive tissue damage can be induced by lower concentrations (1/10 or 1/100 of the acute dose) when tissue is exposed for long periods of time. 3. We developed assays to measure the pred ominant HN2-induced levels higher in postmitotic rat cerebellar neurons than compar ably treated dividing SY5Y cells. We showed that cross-link levels in HN2-treated human SY5 Y neuroblastoma cells increased with increasing concentrations of HN2. Studies are underway to determine if these adducts persist in HN2-treated nervous tissue. 4. We developed an assay for examining the relationship between cytotoxicity and DNA damage. 5. We developed assays for measuring the e ffect of HN2 on neuronal and human skin tissue DNA-repair levels and activity. 6. Nitrogen mustard (HN2) modulated the level and activity of nervous tissue DNA-repair protein APE, which specifically repairs the monofunctional HN2 DNA adduct. Apurinic apyrimidinic cult ures (non-dividing ce lls) while APE levels decreased in human neuronal cultures (dividing cells). APE activity increased in HN2-treated human skin cultures (actively dividing cells). Altered le vels and activity of APE may be an indication of HN2 -induced DNA damage. 7. Nitrogen mustard (HN2) modulated the level and activity of APE in human skin tissue. A significant increase in immunostaining was demonstrated in human skin probed with an antibody to APE. In support, APE activity was increased in cultured human skin explants treated with HN2.

Persian Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Research Database - Project No VA-6E Title: Clinical and Epidemiology Leishmania Research Project Study Location: Type: Clinical Research P.I.: Dennis Bourdette, M.D. Research Focus: Diagnosis Start Date (CY): 1994 Est. Completion (CY): 1999 Leishmaniasis Treatment OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Development of serological test for viserotropic leishmaniasis and determination of infection rate. SPECIFIC AIMS: Core Objective: To determine the possibility and rate of infection of PGW veterans with Leishmania spp, and to dev elop novel anti-leishmanial chemotherapeutics. METHODOLOGY: Immunological screening of patient and volunteer blood. All subjects participating in the case/control study have immunological screening of their blood for evidence of L. tropica infection (studies performed by Corixa Corp., Seattle, WA). Other pertinent topics being explored in the Exper imental Chemotherapy laboratory of the Portland VAMC: 1. Novel chemotherapeutic agents for viscerotropic leishmaniasis. 2. Development of adjunctive therapy for use with existing medicinals used for treatment of Leishmaniasis, as well as other tropical diseases. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): Effective, non-invasive diagnosis of leishmaniasis. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: leishmaniasis among PGW samples from PGWUI cases and controls were probed with a synthetic 45 amino-acid antigen (Ltr-1) based on the known sequence of a L. tropica antigen which has a repeat region spanning 33 amino acids. The synthetic peptide theref ore contains roughly one and one-third repeat units which Corixa has determined to be optimal for an ant ibody-capture ELISA test. Ltr1 is seated on the bottom of each well of a 96-well plate. The plate is blocked, diluted serum (1:50 dilution) added, and the plate washed extensively. A reporter ant ibody is used for detection. Serum analysis was performed on two occasions with comparable results: Run #1: Ten of 102 samples yielded a serotest gr eater than three standard deviations from the mean value obtained from a control group comprising sera of military subjects (unknown exposure history) received from Walter Reed Army Institute of Resear ch (WRAIR). Values obtained from two subjects considered positive controls (one with biopsy-pr oven L. tropica infection) fell within the range of values exhibited by the 10 seropositive samples. Run #2: The same 10 of 102 samples yielded a serotest greater than three standard deviations from the mean value obtained from the control group which contained an additional 70 sera obtained from a commercial source in the Boston area. These sera are believed to have been donated by healthy controls but their exposure history is unknown. The 10 seropositive samples fell within the range of values obtained from additional positive control se ra obtained from Turkish military subjects with the cutaneous form of L. tropica infection. Subjects with seropositive samples distributed as follows: six subjects, including two with the highest antibody titer, were PGWUI cases, two were PGWUI controls, and two had been rejected as cases or controls because their symptoms had resolved at the time of clinical examination. Blood samples were screened without knowledge of the clinical status of the subjects. In summary, approximately 10% of subjects (n=102 ) drawn from a random sample of NW Gulf War veterans showed reproducible evidence of sero positivity using a synthetic peptide antigen that identifies the parasite. The antibody titer is extremely low. While these results raise the possibility of a low level of active L. tropica infection in a proportion of subjects with/without symptoms of PGWUI, the specificity and reliability of this test-under-development are unknown. Wh ile the test apparently has high sensitivity, cross-reactivity has not been ruled out, the false-positive rate is unknown, and the control population may not be ideal. Further studies are needed to test the validity of these preliminary results. At the present time, defin itive diagnosis of L. tropica can only be made by culturing the organism from tissue biopsies. Chemotherapy/Drug Development: Leishmanial visceral leishmaniasis which afflict millions worldwid e primarily in the tropica l and subtropi cal regions of the world. Chemotherapy of leishmaniases re lies heavily on the use of pentavalent antimonials which require lengthy courses of treatment at high doses and parenteral administration. Efficacy is variable and toxic side effects occur. The stand ard antimonial, stibogluconate, is reported to be much less effective in treatment of leishmaniasis in patients with AIDS. Clearly, additional compounds must be identified for treatment of these opportunistic infections of immuno-compromised patients. Ideally, new dr ugs could be developed with fewer side effects and with broad-spectrum activity agai nst each these infectious agents. Prompted by our discovery of t he antimalarial potency of xanthone der ivatives, we were interested in evaluating the activity of xanthones against other protozoan parasites. For this study we chose L. tropica WR 1063, derived from a Persian Gu lf War veteran diagnosed with viscerotropic leishmaniasis. It is well established that both malaria and leishmania parasites have a heme problem: the former has too much and has evolved a mechanism for polymerization of heme to rid itself of the accumulation of this toxic product of hemoglobi n digestion; while the latter is incapable of heme biosynthesis and must scavenge for this critical nutrient from exogenous sources. For in vitro culture of Leishmania, heme is added directly to the medium, provided with the serum supplement, or included as part of a complex medium component such as yeast extract (e.g., Schneider's medium). Existing as amastigotes within the acidic phagolysosome of macrophages, it is unclear how the heme requirement is sustained but prior work in the leishmania field indicates that the intracellular parasites do not rely on the host cell for procurement of heme. Instead, the intracellular forms are able to acquire heme from an exogenous source which we presume to be the bloodstream. Regardless of the mechanisms involved, the parasite heme salvage process represents an ideal target for rational drug design for chemotherapy of leishmaniasis. We have extended our knowledge of the antiparasit ic nature of xanthones to include action against the Leishmania. Our data are consistent with the notion that xanthones and analogs of them may block parasite access to heme as their primary mode of action. If this is true, then the spectrum of activity of xanthones may extend to other organisms (bacterial, fungal, or protozoal), which require access to host-derived heme for survival. Limited testing of xanthones presented has yielded data which point to a key structural element in common with our more extensive antimalarial struct ure-activity profiling, i.e., positioning of amines or amidines at the 4 and 5 positions. For exampl e, the xanthone diamine, 45-DEAE-X, was the most potent xanthone included in our study. So positione d, under physiological pH, the positively charged amino groups would align themselves with the propionate side chains of heme in a net-neutral electrostatic interaction thus adding stability to the heme:drug complex. We are now directing our efforts at synthesis and evaluation of 4,5-diam idinoxanthone (so-called \"X anthamidin\") and analogs of it. We predict that the amidinium cations of this compound will be in the proper geometric orientation to interact with the propoxy acid anions of heme to form a stable bidentate hydrogen-bonding pair. Consideration of the xanthone diamidine led to our investigation of pentamidine, a well known and clinically useful diamidine, as possibly acting in similar fashion. We found that addition of one equivalent of pentamidine induced a remarkable red shift in the Soret band of the heme spectrum at neutral and mildly acidic pH. Furthermore, the in vitro antileishmanial activity of pentamidine correlated directly to the heme concentration present in the culture medium. These data demonstrate that pentamidine forms a tight asso ciation with heme and suggest a possible mechanism for its antiprotozoal effects which extend to its us e in the treatment of infections due to Trypanosoma gambiense and Pneumocystis carinii. Accordingly, we propose that pentamidine, like our desired xanthone constructs, functions to restrict parasite access to heme and porphyrins key components of the energy-generating cytochrome assembly located within the parasite mitochondrion. The absolute reliance of leishmanial parasites on an exogenous supply of heme or porphyrins had already been exposed by numerous investigators. Our preliminary results provide clues as to how this tetrapyrrole salvage process may be blocked by pharmacological agents of improved design. Taken together, and given the attendant concerns over toxicity associated with pentamidine administration and the lack of an orally available form of the drug, there is an urgent need to pursue newer and safer remedies based on biochemical prin ciples and employing the powerful new tools of computer-aided structure-based dr ug design. Based on our findings of the biochemical action of pentamidine on Leishmania parasites and its ability to bind heme, we have employed computer-aided modeling of xanthones complexing to heme. Our stud ies point to the placement of amidines at the 4 and 5 positions of the xanthone nucleus to optimize binding to the propionate side chains of free heme. We have just completed synthesis of one such diamidine, 4,5-\u00df-amidinoethoxyxanthone, and in vitro testing will begin after complete analytical figures are obtained. 4,5-Diamid inoxanthone (\"Xanthamidin\") is our next targeted synthesis. Forthcoming procedures: To synthesize a series of 4,5-xanthone diamidines and compare their inhibitory activity against P. carinii, T. gondii, and L. major in vitro. This study will also include an evaluation of each drug for relative toxicity against the murine monocyte-macrophage cell line J774A.1. The inhibitory action and toxic effect s of each drug will be compared to that produced by the standard agent, pentamidine. agents: Studies of a possible mode of action.

Persian Veterans' Illnesses Research Database - Project No VA-7 Title: Desert Storm Reunion Survey Project #: VA-7 Agency: Study Location: VAMC Boston Project Clinical Research P.I.: Jessica Wolfe, Ph.D. Research Focus: Symptoms/General Health Start Date (CY): 1991 Est. Completion (CY): 1995 Brain & Nervous System OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: The Ft. Devens ODS Reunion Survey represents a longitudinal assessment of readjustment of Persian Gulf War veterans returning through Ft. Devens, Massachusetts following their return from the Gulf region. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1. Describe troop demographics of the Ft. Devens cohort of Persian Gulf War veterans; 2. Examine, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, family and unit support factors, war-zone exposure, PTSD and pyschological distress symptomatology in these veterans; 3. Examine physical health status at Time 2 and explore poten tial risk factors important in the development of adverse physical health after return from a wartime environment. METHODOLOGY: Subjects were recruited from a group of approximately 5000 Persian Gulf War veterans who returned home throu gh Ft. Devens, Massachusetts after the Gulf War. The survey at Time 1 constituted a broad range of demographi c questions accompanied by an assessment of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symp tomatology (Mississippi Scale general (Brief Symptom Inventory, BSI; Derogatis & Melisaratos, at exposure (Gallops, Laufer & Yager 1981; Rosenheck, 1992), along with queries of other relevant domains including change in work status, current family and social functioning, and post-depl oyment major life stressors (e.g., death of a loved one, separation or divorce, loss of property, physical or sexual assault) and at Time 2, additional questions were added to further assess psychological health and physical health symptoms. Individual health symptoms were assessed using the 20-item Health Symptom Checklist (Bartone et al., 1989) which asked subjects to indicate the presence and frequency of symptoms over the past several weeks using Likert-type ratings (0=none, 1= a little, 2=often, 3=very often). In addition, subjects were asked to rate their current physica l and psychological health separately ('poor', 'fair', 'good', 'very good' or 'excellent') as well as to rate changes in their physical and psychological health since return from the Persian Gulf ('much wors (MILESTONES): Data from this investigation is expected to provide an important opportunity to examine patterns of re adjustment and the factors that contribute to the changes in the years soon after return from a wartime environment. Results from analyses of Time 1 and Time 2 collected data have been published. Publications in progress include evaluation of reported health symptoms by this cohort of Pers ian Gulf War veterans at Time 2, examination of reported sexual harassment by the women surv eyed, and a longitudinal assessment of PTSD and psychological symptomatology between Time 1 and Time 2. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Over 84 U.S. Army units (n=2949) were surveyed immediately upon their return to Ft. Devens, Massachusetts (Time 1) between April and July 1991. Persons tested at Time 1 represented approximately 60% of the troops that were deployed to the Gulf from that base, and comparisons between this sample and data avai lable for the Ft. Devens military population at large indicate that survey respondents are generally representative of the base's military population. Examination of nonparticipants at Time 1 indicat ed random absences for administrative and medical purposes. The original cohort contained 2,709 men and 240 women with a mean age of 30.2 years (SD = 8.6) and 13.2 years of educ ation (SD = 1.8). The majority of troops were Caucasian (87.4%) and reservists (52.2% National Guard; 19.9% Ar my reservists; 27.9% active duty). Active duty troops had more black members and were significantly younger in age compared to Guard and Reserve Troops. Overall, veterans in the original cohort do not fully reflect military assignments or ethnic and gender compositions of the total U.S. Army or Gulf force (U.S. Government Accounting Office, 1992; communication with Defense Manpower Da ta Center). Consistent with the Ft. Devens' mission, a higher than average proportion of the original sample had combat support and service support positions during the war, rather than active combat roles. Approximately 18-24 months after initial testing, veterans were resurveyed (Time 2) to reevaluate their adjustment. This survey repeated all Time 1 measures and queried other relevant domains including work status, family and social functioni ng, health status, health service use, and intervening life stressors. In the majority of cases, the Ti me 2 survey was readministered in persons during weekend unit drills. Persons in units that could not be scheduled in a timely fashion were resurveyed using an identical questionnaire sent through t he mail. A total of 2,313 persons successfully completed the Time 2 survey (2,119 men, 194 women; Wolfe et al., 1993), yielding an overall response rate of 78%. Analyses of these data sh ow no significant Time 1 differences between Time 2 respondents and non-respondents on most back ground or outcome measures (e.g., educational level, PTSD symptomatology). However, individuals who did not complete the Time 2 reevaluation were more likely to be younger and on active duty status. Based on veterans' verbal and written comments concerning their health status at Time 2, the Time 3 investigation (now Project #1 of the Boston Environmental Hazards Center) was designed to reexamine overall adjustment with a special emphasis on physical health and psychological status and to evaluate cognitive functioning by neuropsychological test methods on a subset of the larger cohort PUBLICATIONS: Wolfe J.

Completion (CY): 1999 Brain & Nervous System OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: (1) To learn more about reactions to combat exposure, stress, and Persian Gulf War-related health concerns, (2) exploration of the relationships among symptoms, demographic variables and veterans' psychological status, (3) to provide intervention, education, and support to Gulf War veterans by providing a) ge neral information about reactions to combat/desert duty, and b) opportunities for individual discu ssion of experiences and current physical health, (4) administration of standardized psychological questi onnaires and instruments, and (5) referral to VA and other community services available for health and other related concerns. SPECIFIC AIMS: To learn more a bout psychological stress and phys ical symptoms experienced by Persian Gulf War veterans. METHODOLOGY: Initially evaluated 66 Gulf War Marine reservists on a number of psychological instruments within 5 months of Operation Desert Storm using the Mississippi Scale for Desert Storm War Zone Personnel, MMPI-2, Impact of Event Scal e, War Stress Inventory-Operation Desert Storm Version, Rorschach test evaluation of DSM-III-R criteria for po st-traumatic stress and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). At one year follow- up, the MMPI-2 and Impact of Event Scale were collected on a sub-sample of these Gulf War vete rans. At 3-year follow-up, all of the original measures, plus a physical symptom questionnaire selected questions from the Persian Gulf Registry Code Sheet and The Hand Test, were administered to a sub-sample of the original group and a control group of Marine Reservists from the same unit who had never been stationed outside of the U.S. Statistical analyses employed in this study in cluded correlation, paired and independent t-tests, ANCOVA, MANCOVA, discriminant analysis, stepwi se discriminant analysis, and repeated measure design ANOVA. Currently, volunteers referred fo r psychological and neuropsychological evaluation will complete all the measures listed above, t he Halstead-Reitan Ne uropsychological Test Battery, and questions related to disability status. EXPECTED OUTCOMES: Assess the ut ility of psychological instruments in the detection of war-zone stress reactions. Instrument variables associat ed with response to stressors are expected to be related to DSM-III-R criteria for post-traumatic stress and PTSD. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: The project is curr ently ongoing, the sample size is increasing and data are being collected. Results to date show di fferences over time between the initial evaluation data and follow-up, and between initial evaluation a nd control group on selected variables associated acute distress, and capacity for coping. Findings are being analyzed in relation to the assessment, understanding, and treatment of post-traumatic stress symptomology of PTSD.

Persian Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Research Database - Project No VA-9 Title: Evaluation of Cognitive Functioning in Persian Gulf War Veterans Reporting War-related Health Problems Project #: VA-9 Agency: VA Study Location: VAMC New Orleans (CY): 1994 Est. Completion (CY): 1995 Brain & Nervous System OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Addressing a topi c of timeliness and importance, this project evaluated cognitive and psychosocial functioni ng among Operation Desert Storm (ODS) veterans who experienced health problems and physical sympto ms following return from the Persian Gulf War zone. The primary objective of the projec t was to explore environmental, neurotoxic, and psychological correlates of health complaints among these veterans. SPECIFIC AIMS: The project examined potential diffe rences between veterans reporting high levels of health concern and those reporting low levels of concern on measures of psychological well-being, psychopathology, environmental exposure to to xins and adverse environmental events in the war-zone and prior to war-zone duty, and neuropsychological functioning. METHODOLOGY: Conducted in cooperation with a research team of psychologists working at the Boston VAMC, study design incorporated a local sa mple of 78 Persian Gulf returnees who were divided into high and low health concern subsets on the basis of self-reported health status. Participants underwent a clinical diagnostic evaluation that includes administration of an environmental exposure interview; a structured psychodiagnostic interview; a battery of neuropsychological tests selected for their specif icity and sensitivity to neurotoxicity and emotional and motivational factors; and self-report inventories assessing mood, emotional well-being, PTSD symptomatology, combat exposure, and physical symptoms. Statistical analysis incorporated a multivariate analysis of variance approach, comparing the two health concern subgroups from both sites on measures of environmental exposure, psychological and neuropsychological functioning, and physical symptoms. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): Given current interest in the multiple, yet inadequately diagnosed or explained health problems and symptoms reported by sizable subsets of returnees from the Persian Gulf War, this project will have direct relevance to health care delivery in the VA system nationwide. Study results will be pertinent to development of appropriate clinical diagnostic and treatment services for Persian Gulf returnees and veterans of more recent military operations and objective evaluation of veteran disability and compensation claims in the VA system. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Data collection at Ne w Orleans site has been completed. All data have been forwarded to the Boston site for multi-site statistical analysis and dissemination of findings. PUBLICATIONS: none to date Persian Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Research Database - Project No VA-10 Title: Memory and Attention in PTSD Project #: VA Study Location: VAMC Type: Clinical Research P.I.: Jennifer Vasterling, Ph.D. Research Focus: Brain & Nervous System Start Date (CY): 1994 Est. Completion (CY): 1998 Symptoms/General Health OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Clinical reports have documented that as many as 67-100% of veterans undergoing treatment for war-related post-t raumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exhibit deficits in memory and concentration. This project se eks to address the common and potentially debilitating problems of impaired learning, memory, and attenti on functions reported by veterans suffering PTSD. SPECIFIC AIMS: Incorporating two separate investigations, this research applies a comprehensive assessment protocol that includes evaluation of psychopathology and neuropsychological functioning in veterans of Vietnam and a younger cohort of Pers ian Gulf returnees. In particular, the project will provide in-depth description and analysis of learning, memory, and attention functioning among these veterans. METHODOLOGY: Within each study, comparis ons of neuropsychological performances are conducted between community-recruited groups of veterans with PTSD diagnoses related to war-zone duty, veterans with diagnoses of depression, and veterans found to be free of psychopathology. Psychopathology is assessed with structured clinical interview and self-report inventories. Attention, learning, memory, and other cognitive proce sses are assessed with standardized neuropsychological assessment instrum ents. Data analysis, conducted separately for the two cohorts, are accomplished using a multivariate of analysis approach. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES) : Because problems with attention, learning, memory, and other cognitive functions can dr amatically disrupt social and occupational functioning, as well as hinder treatment efforts of war-related stress and other disorders, studies of neuropsychological sequelae to war trauma are pivotal to understanding the complex behavioral and emotional expression of PTSD, to delivery of appropriate, effective treatment interventions to these veterans, and to exploring long-term psychosocial outcomes in veterans suffering PTSD and served by the VA system. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: To date, this new ly funded research has been conducted on a sample of 95 Persian Gulf returnees. Findings reveal t hat in comparison to psychopathology-free veterans, veterans diagnosed with PTSD performed signif icantly more poorly on verbal intellectual tasks including those tasks thought to predict premorbid functioning. Results suggest that intellectual resources, particularly verbal skills, may bu ffer development of stre ss-related psychopathology following trauma exposure. Analysis of cognitive data revealed specific PTSD-related deficits in sustained attention, working memory, initial acquis ition of new material, and resistance to retroactive interference. Collection of data with Vietnam ve terans is ongoing. In addition, PTSD diagnosis was associated with errors of commission and intrusion. Results are consistent with models of PTSD that emphasize the role of hyperarousal and implic ate dysfunction of front al-subcortical systems.

Completion (CY): 1995 Symptoms/General Health OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Complaints of impaired memory and concentration among veterans seeking treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (P TSD) highlight the importance of systematic evaluation of thes e cognitive functions among PTSD-diagnosed veterans. The primary objective of this project was to collect pilo t data regarding learning, memory, and attention functioning in Persian Gulf returnees reporting PTSD symptomatology. SPECIFIC AIMS: The specific aim of this project was to compare learning, memory, and attention performances in samples of Persian Gulf returnees with and without diagnoses of PTSD. METHODOLOGY: Subjects were 15 Pe rsian Gulf War zone veterans diagnosed with military-related PTSD and 27 Persian Gulf War zone veterans f ound to be free of any PTSD symptomatology. All subjects underwent structured psychiatric interview and neuropsychological assessment using a brief screening battery designed to emphasize attention, learning, and memory functioning. Statistical analyses included a series of univa riate analyses of variance (ANOVAs) and univariate analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) using vocabulary performance as a covariate to compare the two samples on demographic variables and dependent measures of cognitive functioning. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTON ES): Results of this project impact potentially on comprehensive assessment and treatment services provided to PTSD-diagnosed Persian Gulf War zone veterans. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Veterans in the PT SD sample were on average older, less educated, and performed more poorly on a vocabulary task used as an estimate of premorbid intellectual sophistication than veterans in the comparison sample. Comparisons of group performances on the neuropsychological tasks reveal ed that the PTSD sample performed more poorly than the comparison sample on measures of simple and complex attention and word retrieval. When differences in estimated native in tellectual skills were controlled for statistically by the inclusion of vocabulary performance as a covariate in a series of ANCOVAs, no significant differences between groups emerged on any of the attention or memory measures. That the effects of PTSD on attention and memory functions could not be parceled out from those attributable to such factors as lower levels of education and premorbid intellectual sophi stication does not negate the clinical significance of study findings. Results of this exploratory pilo t project complement previous research suggesting that higher levels of education and intellectual functioning may buffer the impact of trauma on the development of subsequent stress-related psychopat hology. This phase of the project is complete and has led to the development of a more refin ed and comprehensive neuropsychological protocol to be administered to a larger sample of Persian Gulf veterans.

Completion (CY): 1997 scheduled drill exercises at 6, 8, and 12 months following ODS and at one-year follow-up intervals. OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: This research was designed to determine the psychological sequelae to war-zone exposure among troops who served in the Persian Gulf during Operation Desert Storm (ODS) compared to troops who were activated during ODS but not deployed to the Persian Gulf. SPECIFIC AIMS: Objectives of this project were to condu ct comprehensive psychological assessments and debriefings among the masses of troops mobilized in support of ODS; identify psychological, somatic, and cognitive symptoms and mental disorders, both early and persistent, that are associated with Persian Gulf war--zone exposure; and explore personal resources and environment factors that may differentiate Pers ian-Gulf--deployed troops exhibiting war-related psychopathology from troops found to be free of psychological disturbances. METHODOLOGY: Comprehensive psychological assessments were conducted with non-treatment-seeking troops who served in the Persian Gulf and a comparison sample of troops from the same military units who were activated during ODS but not deployed to the Persian Gulf. Follow-up assessments were conducted to assess psychological status over time and ongoing symptomatology. The subject sample includes 1520 military personnel mobilized in support of ODS, including 517 Louisiana National Guard and 1003 Marine, Army, Air Force, and Navy Reserve troops, 194 of whom were members of Quartermaster units assigned graves registration duties. Subjects reported an average age of 29 years at time of initial assessment and completed an average of 13 years of formal education. The percentage of African- American and other minority troops was 43%, and 14% were women. An assessment battery tapping domains of personal resources, stressor characteristics, negative mood states and traits, psychiatric and physical symptoms, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress di sorder (PTSD) was administered in regularly- An individually-administered comprehensive structured clinical diagnostic interview was conducted with a subset of graves registration troops j udged to be at high risk for negative psychological sequelae because of their gruesome Persian Gulf body handling duties. Data analytic strategies for continuous variables included multivariate and uni variate analyses of variance, with repeated measures where indicated, and stepwise discriminant function analyses. Chi-square analyses were conducted for categorical variables. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES) : By establishing prevalence estimates for negative sequelae to war--zone duty, identifying troops at high risk for development of war-zone-related psychopathology, and determining fa ctors associated with increase d psychological vulnerability to war-zone service, results have imp lications for development of more effective and efficient strategies and procedures for military training and prepar ing troops for war-zone exposure, conducting debriefing exercises to facilitate community reentry following war-zone servic e, and providing mental health treatment interventions specif ic to war-zone-related psychopathology. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: The project is comple ted. Comparisons of data collected upon initial assessment among 876 war-zone deployed and 396 non-war-zone deployed troops showed that troops exposed to war-zone duty reported higher levels of depression, anxiety, and somatic preoccupations than did the non-war-zone deployed sample. Specifically, 23% of the war-zone deployed sample showed at least mild levels of clinical depression, and 14% met criteria for PTSD measured by paper-and-pencil instruments. War- zone troops complained more often of somatic discomfort than did non-war-zone troops, citi ng headaches (22% versus 13%), general aches and pains versus 13%), lack of energy (18% ve rsus 12%), sleep disturbances (17% versus 10%), and common cold or flu (16% versus 11 %). Troops who served in the Persian Gulf described more mental health symptoms as war-zone stress severity increased, and symptom expression amo ng 349 war-zone troops increased over a 1-year follow-up interval on measures of depression, anxiety, anger, physical distress symptoms, and PTSD. Among those who served in the Persian Gu lf war-zone, ethnic minority troops were more frequently assigned PTSD diagnoses than were their white counterparts; however, women did not evidence greater vulnerability to negative psychol ogical sequelae to war-zone exposure than men. War-zone-related PTSD diagnoses were associat ed with low levels of the personality hardiness dimension of commitment, reliance on avoidance as a coping mechanism, low perceived family cohesion, and low satisfaction with available social supports, and scores on these dimensions at initial assessment predicted the presence/abs ence of PTSD at one-year follow-up with 77% accuracy. Comprehensive structured clinical diagnostic inte rviews were administered to a subset of troops judged to be at high risk for negative psychological outcomes to war-zone trauma by virtue of particularly gruesome war--zone assignments, i.e ., graves registration or body handling duties, during the Persian Gulf War. Among 24 Louisiana based troops of the 630th Quartermaster Company who performed Persian Gulf graves regist ration duties, prevalence of current PTSD was found to be 46%, and rates of comorbid disorders among troops assigned PTSD diagnoses included major depression (55%), alcohol abuse/dependen ce (27%), depressive disorder NOS (18%), and simple phobia (9%). Findings were replicat ed and extended by assessments conducted among the Puerto Rico-based 246th Quartermaster Battalion with subsequent comparisons of 40 troops who performed graves registration duties in the Persian Gulf to 20 similarly-trained troops who were not deployed to the Persian Gulf and who had no OD S graves registration exposure. Diagnoses of current PTSD were found in 48% of war-zone deployed troops; whereas, none of the non war zone deployed troops met PTSD criteria. Low rates of pre-ODS deployment psyc hiatric disorders were found in both subsets of troops. Current comorb id diagnoses among troops who met criteria for PTSD included depressive disorder (37%), alcohol dependence (21 %), other anxiety disorder (5%), and polysubstance dependence (5%). One-year follow--up assessments were completed with 17 troops of the 630th Quartermaster Company who we re assigned Persian Gulf graves registration duties, and 47% met criteria for current PTSD . Of the 26 troops of the 246th Quartermaster Battalion who performed war-zone graves registration duties and completed follow-up assessment, 38% evidenced current PTSD. Thus, 42% of troops assessed at follow-up were classified as positive for PTSD two years after war-zone service. PUBLICATIONS: Vasterling JJ, Br ailey K, Constans JI, Borges A, Sutker PB.

Completion (CY): 1995 OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: To collect data on a sample of 50 Persian Gulf Veterans who have returned with physical or psychosocial complaints. SPECIFIC AIMS: To obtain pilot data to gain objective evidence of impairment of cognitive ability and brain function, or of psychosocial disability. METHODOLOGY: Subjects were tested in our laboratories with an extensive battery of neuropsychological tests, event-rela ted brain potentials, measures of cardiac and pupillary reactivity, laboratory measures of attention, and various interviews, tests, and questionnaires to evaluate psychosocial status with an emphasis of PTSD. Da ta were analyzed descriptively and in reference to available literature and normativ e information. The presence of abnormal findings should provide the basis for further study with a controlled investigation. EXPECTED PRODUCTS: To obtain neuropsychological, psychophysiological and psychosocial data from 50 Persian Gulf veterans. STATUS RESULTS TO DATE: A paper describing the neuropsychological test results has appeared in the Journal of the International Neuropsyc hological Society. The findings are summarized as follows. A neuropsychological investigation of 21 Persian Gulf veterans and 38 demographically matched controls was conducted in order to ma ke a preliminary determination concerning presence of neuropsychlogical deficits associated wi th the Persian Gulf War experience. The neuropsychological test battery consisted of m easures of complex attention, memory, and motor skills, previously shown to be sensitive to exposure to environmental toxins. It was found that the Persian Gulf veterans group did not demonstrat e substantial impairment, but an impairment index derived from 14 test variables was st atistically significantly different fr om controls in the direction of poorer performance. A second study involving the psychophysiological data is currently being prepared for submission to Biological Psychiatry as a brief report. We found prolonged latencies, without reduction in amplitude, in the P300 compon ent of the auditory event related potential (ERP) in the Persian Gulf veterans. This prolongation was significantly different from demographically matched controls when we only considered the 13 of 19 subjects who had complaints related to cognitive function, such as memory impairment. The remaining 6 subjects had normal latencies. Prior research has shown that increased lat encies are associated with decline in cognitive efficiency. We therefore concluded that reported cognitive deficits may not be associated with psychological distress alone. A paper reporting these results is under review by the Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society. PUBLICATIONS: Goldstein G, Beers SR, Mo rrow L A, Shemansky WJ, Steinhauer SR.

Persian Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Research Database - Project No VA-15 Title: Vaccine-Mediated Imm unity Location: Basic Research Frederick Heinzel, M.D. Research Focus: Leishmaniasis Start Date (CY): 1993 Est. Completion (CY): 1999 Prevention OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: To determine the ex pression and function of T cell costimulatory molecules during vaccination of mice with Leishmania major antigen and cytokine adjuvants. We hypothesize that distinct costimul atory interactions can be manipulated in vivo to specifically induce or enhance unipolar Th1 CD4+ responses that produce interferon-gamma and thereby protect against disease. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1. Characterize differences in the expression of B7-1, B702, and CTLA4 regulatory molecules during infection or vaccination of susceptible and resistance mice with Leishmania major; 2. Determine the function of B7 -1, B7-2, and CTLA4 using bulk cultures of T cells; 3. Redirect vaccine- and infection-induced CD4+ T cell responses by in vivo manipulation of B7 or CTLA4. METHODOLOGY: Mice are infected or vaccinated subcutaneously with Leishmania major and the draining lymph nodes analyzed by polym erase chain reaction or flow cytometry to characterize the expression of CTLA4, B7-1, B7 -2 on T cells and accessory cells. Comparisons are made between naturally resistant and susceptible mice (C57BL/6 and BALB/c, respectively). The function uninfected or infected mice and stimulated by antibody-mediated cross-linking of CD3 in conjunction with CD28 or CTLA4. Treatment of in fected or vaccinated mice with antibodies against these costimulatory molecules will be used to determine in vivo function. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTON ES): Dysregulated Th1 and Th2 development mediate common human diseases, such as asthma and autoimmune diabetes mellitus and multiple sclerosis. Since blocking B7-2 function in vivo protects susceptible strains of mice against progressive leishmaniasis, existing humanized CTLA4-Ig antagonists of B7-1 and B7-2 might be useful as immunotherapy in leishmaniasis or other diseases resulting from inappropriate polarizations of T cell phenotype. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: B7-2 is increasingl y expressed on T cells developing the memory cell phenotype, suggesting either a role in costimulatin g other T cells or in mediating unique signals when T cell B7-2 is cross-linked by other T cells bearing CD28 or CTLA4. B7-2 positive cells may constitute a functionally distinct subset of CD4+ T cells. Treatment with anti-B7-2 cures leishmaniasis in susceptible BALB/c mice. Blockade of CTLA4 in vivo exacerbates disease by promoting earlier Th2 cell development, whereas B7-2 blockade slows T cell development and favors Th1 predominance.

Persian Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Research Database - Project No VA-16 Title: Protective Immunity in Experimental Visceral VA St Antonio Status: Completed Research Type: Basic Research P.I.: Peter Melby, M.D. Research Focus: Leishmaniasis Start Date (CY): 1994 Est. Completion (CY): 1997 OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Characterizati on of the protective immune mechanisms in experimental visceral leishmania, and identificati on of the parasite antigens which elicit such protective responses. SPECIFIC AIMS: Studies of the murine model of visceral leishmaniasis will provide a means to characterize the operative protective immune mec hanisms as well as identify parasite antigens which have potential use for human vaccination. Characte rization of the protective immune mechanisms in experimental visceral leishmaniasis will be accomplished by studies of the in situ cytokine response to primary infection in susceptible mice, as well as identification of responses associated with the acquisation of immunity. Once the mechanisms associated with protective immunity have been defined the parasite antigens relevant to imm unity can be identified. Purified and recombinant Leishmania donovani antigens which elicit an in vitro cytokine response which correlates with in vivo immunity will be identified and characterized. METHODOLOGY: The murine model of visceral leishmaniasis will be used to characterize the mechanisms involved in protective immunity at the tissue level. These studies were performed using a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction methodology for measuring cytokine (IL 4, 11 6, IL 10, IL12, IFN - y) gene expression in skin, Lymph node, and spleen. Comparisons were made between mice infected locally (skin) and systematic ally (intravenous). Expression of these cytokines the local containment of L. donovani infecti on through induction of a Th1 response, we have in the spleen was also studied at the protein le vel using immunohistochemical techniques. Because infection of mice with L. donovani does not resu lt in a progressive lethal infection, we have also begun to study the immunopathogenesis of VL in the Syrian hamster model which very closely mimics the progressive, fatal disease seen in humans. Because there were no reagents available to study this model, we cloned and sequenced a numb er of the hamster cytokine IL-10, IL-12, IFN-y, TNF alpha, and TGF-beta). These molecular probes were then used to characterize the expression of cytokine mRNAs in active VL in the hamster model. In our work to identify vaccine candidates for this disease, we have cloned recombinant L. donovani antigens into a eukaryotic vector for use in DNA immunization studi es. Because of the prominent role IL-12 plays in constructed an IL-12 expression plasmid for use as an adjuvant in the DNA immunization studies. Once the in situ mechanisms are better defined, in vitro correlates of immunity (e.g. a certain cytokine profile) can be identified. Semipurified or purified soluble antigens will then be tested in vitro for their capacity to elicit a proliferative resp onse and protective cytokine profile in stimulate splenocytes or Lymph nodes. A recombinant library will also be directly screened using spleen cells from immune animals. This will enable the i dentification of vaccine candidates which can subsequently tested in the animal model. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): 1. Identification of cytokines associated with control of infection; 2. Identification of cy tokines associated with resistance to reinfection; 3. Identification of antigens having the potential to stimulate protective immunity. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Mice infected with L. donovani amastigotes by the intradermal route develop minimal cutaneous lymp hadenopathy, but no detectabl e visceral (hepatic) parasite burden. In contrast, mice infect ed by the intravenous route develop progressive hepatosplenomegaly and a visceral parasite burden that increases up to 4-6 weeks after infection. To understand the mechanisms associated with the local control of infection and active visceral disease, we have characterized the in situ expre ssion of cytokines (IFN-y, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-12) in the spleen, draining the lymph node, and cutaneou s site of inoculation compared to the spleen following systemic inoculation. IL-10 and TGF-b mRNA and protein expression were prominent in the spleens of systemically infected animals. There was significant expression of both IL-10 and IL-12 at the cutaneous site of inoculation starting 7 days after infection. Thus there seems to be a mixed Th1/Th2 type response to primary infection in this model, but local control (skin and draining LN) appears to be associated with markedly increased levels of IFN-y and IL-12 RNA. These differences may be due to more efficient antigen presentation at the LN level following cutaneous infection (possibly from migration of cutaneous cells), or the induction of immunological tolerance following intravenous infection. Additional studies were performed using a similar methodology to characterize the immunopathogenesis of VL in the highly susceptib le hamster model. In order to study the model, multiple hamster cytokine genes were cloned, sequenced and used as molecular probes to determine the levels of mRNA expression in response to active visceral disease. There was a strong Th1 cytokine expression in the spleen in spite of the progressive nature of disease in this model of lethal infection. IL-10, but not IL-4 expression was markedly increased in response to infection and is likely to play a role in the progressive nature of this disease. A number of L. donovani antigens previously iden tified as a target of immune T cells have been cloned for study of vaccine candidates. The open reading frames have been cloned into a eukaryotic expression vector, expressed in mouse fibroblas ts and macrophages, and the nature of the T cell response directed toward it is being characterize d. Mice have been immunized with these constructs and studies to determine their protective efficacy ar e in progress. The IL-12 expression vector we have constructed will be used as an adjuvant in these immunization studies. PUBLICATIONS: Melby PC, Yang YZ, Cheng J, Zhao W.

Persian Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Research Database - Project No VA-17 Title: Immunological Evaluati on of Persian Agency: VA Study Location: VAMC Birmingham Project Clinical Research Michael P. Everson Research Focus: Immunology Start Date (CY): 1994 Est. Completion (CY): 1995 OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: To understand possible contributions of immunological abnormalities to disease manifestations in Persian Gulf War veterans. The chief complaints of these veterans include arthralgias and central nervous sy stem dysfunctions, i.e., disorders which may have a common immunological basis. The intent of this proposal was to expand upon ongoing medical and neurobehavioral analyses of veterans from the Birmingham VA Medical Center to include an immunologic component in the evaluation of these veterans. SPECIFIC AIMS: Evaluate potential changes in t he immunological status of Persian Gulf War veterans using sensitive biological assays of immune cellular function such as those previously described for use in evaluating chemical sensitivities. METHODOLOGY: Functional immune integrity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was tested in subjects (approximately 40) and age- and sex-ma tched controls (approximately 10). Longitudinal samples were obtained from 2 subjects. Antigenic and mitogenic responses were determined using the recall antigen tetanus toxoid and the T-cell mitogen phytohemagglutinin. Proliferative responses were measured by tritiated thymidine uptake and co mpared with cultures of unstimulated subject or control cells. Data were reduced and statisti cally compared using a two-sample, unpaired t test. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: The final number of samples analyzed for immune function in mitogen-induced and antigen-induced proliferativ e assays included approximately 40 Persian Gulf veterans and 7 age- and sex-matched controls . When these two groups were compared for mitogenic responses, no significant difference was noted (p> 0.06). This finding suggested that the subjects and controls had similar T cell function potential since the phytohemagglutinin mitogen is a polyclonal stimulant used to assess potential for T cell responses. However, when these two groups were compared for antigenic response using the tetanus toxoid recall antigen, a significant difference was noted (p= 0.027). With less than 50 subjects and less than 10 controls, these data are to be viewed and interpreted only as prelimin ary findings suggestive of a difference in recall response to antigenic stimulation. More subjects are needed prior to publication or dissemination of these preliminary findings.

Completion (CY): 1996 OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Clearly define the most prevalent chronic gastrointestinal symptoms in a unit of Persian Gulf veterans. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1. Determine and define symptom complex. 2. Look for underlying pathophysiology. METHODOLOGY: Survey of a single unit of Persi an Gulf veterans. Hydrogen breath tests on affected individuals. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTON ES): Ultimately to identify pathophysiology of the gastrointestinal symptoms. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Survey completed. Have identified most prevalent symptoms. Note: Following is quoted from poster accepted fo r Poster Presentation at Digestive Disease week in San Diego, May 1995, Chronic Gastrointestinal Sy mptoms In Persian Gulf Veterans; MB Sostek, S Jackson, JK Linevsky, EM Schimmel, BG Fincke; Departments of Medicine and Social Services, Boston Veterans Affairs Medical Center and Bost on University School of Medicine, Boston, MA. Background: Persian Gulf Syndrome is characte rized by a constellation of chronic symptoms postdating deployment to the Gulf Region in 1991. Intermittent diarrhea is one of the eight most commonly reported symptoms. The prevalence of non-di arrheal gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms is not well documented. Over the past year, we have re ceived increasing referrals for evaluation of Persian Gulf veterans (PGV) with various GI complaints. The aims of this study were I) to determine the prevalence and spectrum of GI complaints in a representative sample from this population and II) to compare this data to a control group of soldiers not deployed to the gulf region. Methods: A 4-page questionnaire was mailed to the 92 members of a National Guard Unit deployed to the Persian Gulf Region in 1991 and distributed to 44 members (controls) of the same unit who were not deployed to the Gulf Region in 1991. The questionnaire asked the veterans to grade current severity of 26 GI and 10 non-GI symptom s. The survey also asked veterans to recall occurrence of 5 GI symptoms either dur ing or before the Dessert Storm mission. Results: 57/92 Persian Gulf veterans (62%) respon ded to the survey. All 44 of the controls returned the suvey. The table below summarized the reported frequency of several GI symptoms in this population: GI Symptom Before ODS After ODS Controls (Current) Loose compared to symptom frequency before desert storm. Additional frequently reported GI symptoms among PGV's in this survey include: sensation of incomplete rectal evacuation post defecation 34/57 (60%), and watery bowel movements following episodes of abdominal pain 30/57 (53%). The mo st frequent (675). Conclusion: A significant number of veterans from a single National Guard unit, deployed to the Persian Gulf, developed GI symptoms while in that region. The majority of these veterans currently continue to report persistent loose stools, lower abdominal pain, excessive gas and tenesmus. Veterans in the same unit, who were not deployed to the Gulf region, report significantly fewer chronic GI symptoms at the present time. While these symptoms are suggestive of the development of irritable bowel syndrome following Persian Gu lf deployment, further studies are needed to better understand the pathophysiology of this combination of chronic GI symptoms.

Completion (CY): 1993 RESULTS: Analysis of the data indicated that individuals deployed to the Persian Gulf differed OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: The study exami ned the psychological effects of military service in the Persian Gulf during Operation Desert Shield/Storm. SPECIFIC AIMS: Noncombat reserv e and national guard tr oops who were in the Persian Gulf were compared to activated and nonactivated troops who remained in the United States during the Persian Gulf War. The study determined the difference betw een the three groups in terms of psychological adjustment and impact on cognitions and feelings about the war. METHODOLOGY: Subjects were 507 members of National Guard and Reserve units in Northcentral Florida. Data was collected over a two-month ti me period from July 29 to September 23, 1991. Thus, the data was collected approximately 6 months a fter the ground war ended, and usually from one to two months after the troops had returned to the United States. Data was collected during the customary monthly weekend drills, and with the en dorsement of the units' commanders. For units that had been deployed to the Persian Gulf, troops were also briefed about the potential emotional and family problems associated with post-war adjustm ent, were provided with information about veterans benefits, and were advised of the availability of readjustment counseling in our VAMC and other facilities in their communities. T he order of presentation of these elements of necessity varied from site to site, and sometimes within a site, as it was imperative to oblige the needs of the units' and those of others involved (e.g. Vet Center counselors, veterans benefits counselors). Subjects were assured of the anonymity of their responses, and were instructed to hand their packets of questionnaires directly to the study's investigators, in an attempt to assuage subjects' concerns that their careers might be jeopardized by their disclosures. However, it is evident that doubts lingered, as some subjects commented on their concerns about how the results might be used, and many failed to provide their names (req uested in order to conduct follow-up). Six troops omitted information about their gender as well, and were thus excluded from analysis. The subjects, tested at different sites, consist ed entirely of combat support troops, including engineering units, mobile medical units, transport ation units, military police, a quartermaster unit, and a demolition unit. Of the 507 troops included as subjects, 397 were male and 110 were female. Although a minority in the other units, females made up about 50% of the mobile medical units. For the purpose of analysis, subjects are categorized as deployed (i.e. activated and sent to the Persian Gulf during Operation Desert Storm/Shield), activated/not deployed (activated for duty during Operation Desert Storm/Shield but serving in the United States) and not activated (remaining on non-active status throughout O peration Desert Storm/Shield). Males Females Deployed 213 75 Not Activated 173 26 Activated/Not Deployed 11 9 Due to the low numbers currently available in the Activated/Not Deployed category, the analysis is restricted to Deployed and Not Activated. Unit officers provided strong encouragement to t heir troops to participate in the study, and although it is not possible to know exactly what percentage did actually participate, 90% would be a reasonable estimate. Of those subjects that did return t heir questionnaire packets, many did not complete the entire protocol, which normally required about one hour to complete. The questionnaires were presented in the following order: 1) demographic questionnaire, 2) combat exposure scale from the War Stress Interview, 3) SCL-90 plus 15 addition al items from the Cincinnati Stress Reaction Scales, 4) Gainesville Readjust ment Questionnaire, 5) Family En vironment Scale, 6) Impact of Events Scale (IES), 7) Work Environment Scale. significantly from individuals in reserve and guard units who were not activated during ODS. Specifically, they reported a greater degree of in trusion and avoidance symptoms related to the war, as measured by the IES. ODS veterans who we re also veterans of prior wars reported fewer intrusion and avoidance symptoms. Age was not fo und to be a significant factor. The scores on the Gainesville Questionnaire, postulated to indicate enhanced coping strategies, did not correlate significantly with evidence of superior mental health on the SCL-90-R or the IES. A lack of significant difference between ODS veterans and control group in terms of SCL-90-R scores suggests that the overall psychological health of most of the ODS veterans does not appear to have been affected by the war. Howeve r, it is apparent that some subj ects had lingering doubts about the possible repercussions of admitting problems, and this is likely to have suppressed some of the SCL-90-R scores, which showed le ss pathology than non-patient norm s in the general population. Additionally, the units available to this invest igation were all combat support units, and combat exposure was consequently more limited and less se vere than for combat units. Only 156 subjects returned follow-up data, with only 27 completing all 3 follow-ups. An ANOVA conducted to determine if the follow-up group was representative of the larger population resulted in a significant interaction effect, in which ODS veterans who cooperated with the follow-up admitting to higher intrusion and avoidance symptoms on their initial testing. Th us, the follow-up data was concluded to not represent a random sample of the desired population. O ne subject found the mailed follow-up questionnaires caused discomfort and indicated that she did not want to be contacted further. We abided by her request. No other adverse effects were noted.

Research Focus: Brain & Nervous System Start Date (CY): 1992 Est. Completion (CY): 1994 OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to compare three Arizona Reserve Medical Units involved in Operation Desert Stor m on PTSD symptomatology one year after the war utilizing the revised Mississippi Scale for Com bat-Related PTSD (Keane, Caddell, and Taylor, 1988). One of the groups was deployed to Saudi Arabi a(N=42), one to England (N=37), and one to Arizona (N=17). SPECIFIC AIMS: The hypothesis was that the group deployed to Saudi Arabia would have significantly higher scores than the other two groups. METHODOLOGY: Subjects consisted of three Ariz ona Military Reserve Medi cal Units, one deployed to Saudi Arabia, one deployed to England and one deployed locally. Members of all units included physicians, nurses and other medical specialists. The group deployed to Arizona (AZ) consisted of 17 subjects, 10 females (58.8%) and 7 males (41.2%). Of the 13 subjects in AZ who provi ded demographic data, 2 were age 20-29 (15.4%), 5 were 30 to 39 (38.5%), and 6 were 40 to 50 ( 46.2%). Ages ranged from 20 to 54. The mean age was 38.9. Mean age for females was 34.7. Mean age for males was 43.1. The group deployed to England (ENG) consisted of 37 subjects, 21 females (56.8%) and 16 males (43.2%). Eleven were age 20-29 (29.7%), 14 were 30 to 39 (37.8%), 9 were 40 to 49 (24.3%), and 1 was 50 to 59 (2.7%). Ages ranged from 21 to 56. The mean age was 33.7. Mean age for females was 34.4. Mean age for males was 33. The group deployed to Saudi Arabia (SA) consisted of 42 subjects, 20 females (47.6%) and 22 males (52.4%). Twelve subjects were age 20-29 (28.6%), 10 were 30-39 15 were 40-50 (35.7%) and 5 were 50-59 (11.9%). Ages ranged from 21 to 56. The mean age was 37. Mean age for females was 35.8. Mean age for males was 38 .1. Design, Procedures, and Instruments. These data were collected in the first half of 1992, approx imately one year after the end of the Persian Gulf War. At a regular monthly unit meeting, consenti ng subjects were administered the current revision of the Mississippi Scale for Combat-Related PTSD (Keane, Caddell and Taylor, 1988) and a questionnaire on demographics, substance abuse and effects on family. The validity and reliability of the Mississippi Scale have been established by Kean e, Caddell and Taylor (1988). Subjects were invited to write additional comments about the im pact of the war and were given an opportunity to volunteer to be interviewed. The purpose and procedures of the study were desc ribed to subjects, and they were informed that they could withdraw from the study at any time prior to publication. They were also informed that participation or refusal to participate will not affe ct their military careers or subsequent benefits. All responses remained confidential. Data we re identified by codes rather than names. Mississippi Scale means of the three groups were analyzed by a one-way Analysis of Variance. The Scheffe Test of Multiple Comparisons was perfor med post hoc. Subjects' written comments, as well as responses regarding drug and alcohol use, we re compiled and summarized but not statistically analyzed. The Semi-Structured Initial Interview for Desert Storm War-Zone Personnel (Litz, Knight, Wolfe, Kaloupeck, Quinn, Krinsley, Fisher, Weathers, & Keane, 1991) was administered to ten members of SA by one of the authors. The authors analyzed the data for common themes. Interviewees' descriptions of war-zone stressors are reported in the results section of the paper.

War-Zone Stressors of SA as Described by Interviewees. The unit arrived in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, on January 4, 1991 and was evacuated on April 4, 1991. Initially billeted in Al Khobar, near the Dhahran Air Base, they were in Al Khobar when the SCUD missile hit. As medical personnel, they were not allowed to carry weapons according to the Geneva Convention, but they were required to pull guard duty both in Dhahran and in the field. They were responsible for setting up their own combat support hospital 10 miles north of the Iraqi border. The closest support hospital to the front lines, they were married with a helicopter unit and received 32% of the war's casualties from both Allied and Iraqi forces. Specific casualties were seen as especially stressful: The first female casualty, abandoned Iraqi children for whom they had no pediatric instruments, and a nurse and physician who were killed when the Claymore mi nes they had gathered as souvenirs exploded. Nine subjects feared for their lives. Seven said the SCUD missile landing was highly stressful. Two women found the casualties, particularly women a nd children, extremely stressful. Others said the casualties were not particularly stressful because they saw severe injuries in their daily work. Noncombat War-Zone Stressors. All subjects said that they were anxious and/or bored waiting for war to begin. Worries included fear of dying, chem ical warfare, the morality of the war, and welfare of family members at home or serving in Saudi Arabia. Six subjects mentioned cultural or environmental stressors. A Jewish man feared to rture if taken prisoner. Two women said Saudi men touched them and/or made sexual comments. A woman feared \"crazy\" Saudi drivers. Two women and two men spoke of heat and the \"endless\" and \"d ark\" desert. Other stressors were relationships with other unit members, distrust of leaders, poor sanitation, and physical labor. Deployment and Homecoming Stressors. Deployment stressors included anxiety about leaving family members and disruption of careers. Three women menti oned leaving children as the hardest thing they had ever done. One woman worried about her aging mother. Homecoming stressors included physical problems and changes in relationships and careers. Three women said that readjustment was more difficult than they had anticipated. A man divorced after the war. A woman had to start over in school. One woman attributed symptoms of di arrhea, fatigue, and irritability to a \"parasite\". Another had carpel tunnel. All subjects denied exacerbation of previous traumas. Coping Strategies. Subjects coped with stress by talking to friends, relying on religious faith, reading, calling or writing home, self-talk (e.g., \"C alm down.\" \"It will be all right.\"), playing cards, keeping busy/exercise/physical labor, shopping, jo king, eating, writing a journal, remembering home, and romance. Several subjects compared coping strategies of men and women. One woman said that women were supportive of one another and thus had fewer emotional problems than men. Another woman said women talked easily and could cry. She said, \" Ma ybe it seems like you're hysterical, but then you feel better. You get hugged when you cry.\" She said women negotiated assignments if they didn't get along with tentmates; men accepted assignments they didn't like. She noted that both soldiers who were evacuated were men. One man stated that men \"adjusted better\" while women complained about \"access to phones, the filth, and not getting mail\". Some interviewees compared coping strategies of younger soldiers and older soldiers. Three women in their forties and a 49 year old man stated that younger soldiers had more trouble coping than older ones. Older soldiers \"laughed a lot, read a lot, played bridge, [and] didn't dwell on\" troubles. The man and two of the women said the younger members engaged in sex to cope with stress. One woman noticed that younger soldiers who coped be st kept active. Two women noted that some unit members drank alcohol to cope. Lasting Psychological Impact of the War. Positive effects of the war included greater faith in self, lasting friends, pride in accomplishment s, adventure, and a greater sense of purpose. Only one subject approached full PTSD. She had a flashback while working in the emergency room and still reacted to loud noises. One man said he had not slept through the night since the war. One woman was emotionally numb. One man was avoidant. Several interviewees thought that members most affected by the war had quit the Reserves. Several thought that people who had served in Vietnam were more distressed by ODS than other members. A nurse who served in both wars said that bette r facilities made Vietnam \"easier\"; \"primitive\" conditions made ODS very stressful.

Completion (CY): 1997 OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Describe motivational aspects of stress in relationship to war experience. SPECIFIC AIMS: Determine stress symptoms and thei r causal attribution in Desert Storm veterans. METHODOLOGY: Survey Methodology: Life stress questionnaire, multiple regression analysis. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILEST ONES): Pilot study - may lead to further studies. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: An inquiry was launched into the stress levels of a sample of Desert Storm veterans and the causes to which they attributed their stress levels. The instrument that we used to assess stress levels and the causes to which they were attributed is the life stress questionnaire (LSQ). This device assesses stress level (SL) as the total number of 52 psychiatric symptoms (expressed in layman's language) that are endorsed by the respondent. It assesses attributive causes of this stress level by mean s of ratings by the respondent of 14 domains of causation. For the purpose of this research, a ttributive ratings were requested for an additional domain of causation, \"after effe cts of my military experience\". 200 veterans on a VAMC Desert Storm regist ry were randomly selected as respondents. Questionnaires were mailed to them. The follow-up process was complicated since many subjects had moved and left no forwarding address. When th is occurred, new subjects were randomly drawn from the registry file. After 8 follow-ups over a 4-month period, 119 questionnaires (59.5 percent return rate) had been accumulated and data analysis was undertaken. These questionnaires were alternately assigned as they had been received to either a trial group (Group T) or a replication group (Group R). Stress symptoms endorsed by a majority of the subjects in both groups included muscular stiffness and pain, fatigue, restlessness, for getfulness, and irritability. SL for Group T was 13.25 with an SD of1.25. For Group R, SL was 15.84, SD 1.43. The leading attributive cause in both groups was After Effects of Military Experi ence (AEM). For the Trial Group, the mean for this item was 3.41 (on a 5-point scale); for the R Group, the mean for AEM was 3.73. Multiple regression analyses were run to determine the pattern of attributive causes first in the Group T and then in t he Replication Group. This analysis yielded large and highly significant multiple Rs in both groups. Since Rs approach the range that is more typical of reliability coefficients than validity coefficients, it should be mentioned that past experiences with the LSQ suggest t hat the strength of the coefficients reflects the high consistency of the instrument and, perhaps, in this case, the moti vation of the subjects and the meaningfulness of the assignment. In the Group T, R=.94, p<.0001 with the Social Conflict (SC). In the Group R, R=.89, p<.0001 with attributive causes including SC, S I, Health and Self, Health and Dependent, and Demands of School or Class work. The LSQ has been used in several other studies and it is of interest to remark that the stress levels reported by these Desert Storm veterans are higher than in any of our previous studies. It is also important to consider that alt hough the predominant attribution of the subjects was to AEM, this variable appeared as a predictor only in the Group T. The study was exploratory in nature and therefore the size of our trial and replicat ions groups was smaller than would generally be acceptable when multiple regression methodology is employed. The inductive nature the multiple regression may have resulted in the identification of unique features of either or both Groups. Whether the findings that characterize either group would ge neralize to a larger registry sample or to Desert Storm veterans as a group is unknown. Had we found more commonality between the predictors for Group T and those for Group R we might have ventured a hypothesis about attributive causation in Desert Storm veterans. But lacking such a commonality, we will point only to the appearance of Social Isolation and Social Conflict in the equations for both groups. Finally, is should be mentioned that the predominant or most popular attributive cause in bo th group was the AEM; the ratings of this variable by the Group R were even higher than for Group T. Th e failure of the AEM variable to survive in the multiple regression analysis may reflect the greater convergence of opinion of veterans about the impact of their military experience in their present lives. In variance may have resulted in exclusion of these variables in the statistical analysis.

Resear ch Symptoms/General Health Start Date (CY): 1994 Est. Completion (CY): 1999 OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: The Gulf War Sy ndrome is most likely a heterologous group of disorders resulting from the interaction of each veteran's host defense against the variety of environmental, viral, bacterial and stress toxins uni que to the Persian Gulf War. One of the more debilitating symptoms of the GWS has been the arth ralgia and arthritis. These complaints are relatively common to foreign deployments. A question arises as to whether musculoskeletal complaints are indeed a manifestation unique to Gulf War Syndrome. The project will address a fundamental question about the Gulf War Syndrome: Do the musculoskeletal symptoms in the GWS reflect those of long foreign deployment or are th ere unique aspects of these symptoms that identify these symptoms as part of Gulf War Syndrome. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1. Survey deployments for musc uloskeletal symptoms via questionnaire; 2. Compare comparative peace-time vs. Gulf War deployments for musculoskeletal symptoms. METHODOLOGY: Veterans of the Persian Gulf War with and without symptoms of the Gulf War Syndrome and healthy veterans of the same period who did not serve in the Persian Gulf but have been deployed for peaceful missions will receive a que stionnaire which, if positive, will be followed by physician interview in the Department of Vetera ns Affairs Medical Center, Long Beach (VAMCLB) and March Air Force Base, California. Statistical analysis of the comparative features of those examinations will be evaluated for appearance of features that could be re lated to the other than foreign deployment, i.e., GWS. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTON ES): 1. Survey and range of musculoskeletal symptoms secondary to foreign deployments; 2. Comparison of symptoms between foreign deployments and those to GW theater; 3. Statistical analysis ba sed on chi square and regression analysis of independent variables. Review of available data of deployed reservists/v eterans with persistent arthritis/arthralgia 200+ initial questionna ires; 25 comprehensive examinations.

PUBLICATIONS: none to date Persian Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Research Database - Project No VA-46 Title: Diarrhea in Persian Gulf Vete rans: An Project Location: Project A. Resear ch Symptoms/General Health Start Date (CY): 1995 Est. Completion (CY): 1996 OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: To compare viscer al sensation in normal subjects, patients with irritable bowel syndrome and patients with diarr hea that abruptly began while serving in the Persian Gulf. SPECIFIC AIMS: a) To determine if Persian Gulf veterans wi th abdominal pain, diarrhea and bloating with a negative investigative work-up hav e an underlying visceral hypersensitivity or a generalized decreased pain threshold. b) To exam ine the heightened visceral sensitivity present in patients with irritable bowel syndrome and comp are the data to those obtained for Persian Gulf veterans with diarrhea. c) To investigate whethe r an acute treatment with octreotide will increase the tolerance to balloon distention of the rectum and ex tremity immersion in ice water in Persian Gulf veterans, patients, with the irritable bowel syndrome, and controls. d) To determine the effect of octreotide on oral-cecal transit as measured by the lactulose hydrogen breath test. METHODOLOGY: Study Design: Informed consent is bei ng obtained prior to the start of the trial. A complete medical history and physical exam will be performed. Blood samples will be collected for a pregnancy test when appropriate. Pa rticipants will be asked to discontinue all medications for at least 24 hours before the study, to fast for 12 hours, and to take a Fleet's enema 2 hours before the test procedure. Both the ice water tolerance test and the balloon distention tolerance test will be performed in controls, patients with irritable bowel syndrome, and in Persian Gulf veterans both at baseline and after the administration of octreotid e 100 mg subcutaneously. Oral-cecal Transit: The effect of octreotide on small bowel transit will be assessed by the hydrogen breath test. Lactulose (10 g) will service as the carbohydrate substrat e for the breath test. Breath hydrogen concentration is measured by gas chromatography every 15 mi nutes until peak hydrogen excretion occurs. Peak hydrogen excretion is defined as the highest hy drogen concentration before two successive lower concentrations. Peak hydrogen excretion is the poi nt in time at which the lactulose substrate has reach the cecum. Two points on the hydrogen curve will be used to calculate small intestinal transit. The first is the time to an initial sustained in crease of hydrogen concentration of \u00b310 ppm over baseline. The second point is the time to peak hydrogen excretion. Ice Water Tolerance: The ice water tolerance test is performed to determine if patients have a generalized nonspecific lowered pain threshold from a central pathway. All subjec ts will be asked to insert their right hand into a mixture of ice and water to the wrist point and to hold it there for as long as possible. The time before withdrawing the hand from the water will be measured with a stop watch for each subject. If the hand is not withdrawn before 4 min, the subject will be instructed to withdraw the hand and a value of 240s will be assigned. Balloon Distention Tole rance: The balloon distention test evaluates a specific visceral afferent pathway as a cause of symptoms in patients with diarrhea. After each subject withdraws their hand from the ice water, a 5-min recovery period is observed. A standard anorectal manometry catheter or barostat (m odified manometry balloon that measures rectal compliance) will then be inserted into the rectum of a depth of 10-15 cm. In normal subjects, progressive rectal distention initially leads to the perception of pressure, followed by fecal urgency, and then pain. The subjects' response to progressiv e rectal distention will be quantitated as: 1) first rectal sensation of the balloon, 2) urge to defecate from balloon dist ention, 3) rectal discomfort from balloon distention and, 4) rectal pain from balloon distention. The rectal balloon will then be distended in a stepwise fashion by adding 20 ml of air every 3 minutes. Unless this represents the subject's maximum tolerable volume, additional 20-ml increments of air will be added at 3-min intervals up to a maximum of 300 ml. The maximum tolerable volume will be defined as the volume at which the subject requests termination of the proc edure because of discomfort. If the subject does not report discomfort, a value of 200 ml will be assigned. After baseline measurements of ice water and balloon distention tolerance, all subjects ar e being brought back another day for octreotide testing. Octreotide 100 mg will be subcutaneous ly administered. Thirty minutes following the injection, the ice water and balloon distention to lerance will be repeated in exactly the same manner as above and compared to baseline values. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): Expected results are that the patients with Persian Gulf diarrhea, as well as irritable bowel syndrome, will have similar rectal sensat ion, as well as similar rectal urge to defecate, as well as similar discomfort relative to distention. Second, it is not expected that there should be a difference in ice wate r tolerance among either of the three groups. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: At this time, 18 pat ients have been studied (4 normals, 5 irritable bowel syndrome patients, and 9 patients with Persian Gulf diarrhea ). Patients who developed chronic diarrhea while in the Persian Gulf have a significant ly lower threshold for symptoms of initial rectal sensation and the perception of discomfort with rectal balloon distension. This visceral hypersensitivity in Persian Gulf Veterans is simila r to that observed in pati ents with Irritable Bowel Syndrome. The hydrogen breath test and octr eotide protocols have not yet been completed. Additional testing was added to the protocol to incl ude psychological testing. They include the State Anxiety Index, the Beck Depression Index, and the NE O. These non-invasive tests will be done by the subjects on a volunteer basis. The results will be compared among the thr ee groups: Persian Gulf war veterans who had abrupt onset of chronic diarrhea; controls; and subjects with irritable bowel syndrome.

Persian Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Research Database - Project No VA-47 Title: Retrospective Verification of Mustard Gas Exposure Project #: VA-47 Agency: VA Study Location: VAMC Louisville Project Status: Research Type: Clinical Research P.I.: Jerald L. Hoffman, Ph.D. Research Focus: Chemical Weapons Start Date (CY): 1997 Est. Completion (CY): 2000 Diagnosis OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Determine if ther e is a correlation betw een mustard gas exposure and human reproductive and developmental problems. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1. To establis h a GC/MS method for analysis of the mustard gas a dduct with the N-terminal valine of hemoglobin. 2. To analyze blood samples from Persian Gulf War veterans collected within eight months of potential expos ure to chemical weapons. 3. To analyze blood samples from military personnel at the Bluegrass Army Depot coll ected during routine health surveillance. 4. To survey Persian Gulf War ve terans and military personnel working with chemical agents for reproductive difficulties and for developme ntal problems in their children. 5. To search for a correlation of verified exposure to mustard gas with reproductive and developmental problems. 6. To examine cross-linked hemoglobin as a more se nsitive marker of mustard gas exposure. 7. To further characterize the endogenous protection ag ainst mustard gas afforded by S-methylation by the human enzyme, thioether methyltransferase. METHODOLOGY: 1) to establish a GC/MS method fo r analysis of the mustard gas adduct with the N-terminal valine of hemoglobin; 2) to analyze blood samples from Persian Gulf War veterans collected within eight months of potential exposure to chemical weapons; 3) to analyze blood samples from military personnel at the Bluegrass Army Depot collected during routine health surveillance; 4) to survey Persian Gulf War veterans and m ilitary personnel working with chemical agents for reproductive difficulties and for developmental pr oblems in their children; and 5) to search for a correlation of verified exposure to mustard gas with reproductive and developmental problems. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): This research will be helpful in defining the role of mustard gas exposure in the Persian Gulf War 'syndrome' of which many VA patients complain. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Progress to date ha s involved the chemical synthesis of valine hemoglobin mustard adducts derivatized for gas chromatography/mass s pectroscopic analysis (GC-MS). These inclu de deuterium-labe led forms which will be used as internal standards for GC-MS analysis of hemoglobin samples. We are presently beginning to standardize the analysis of these reagents in the GC-MS. A second approach to determining exposure to mu stard gas has been initiated. Since mustard gas is bifunctional it has the potential to cross-link the various pairs of subunits of hemoglobin. Such cross-linked dimers could be detected by the appearance of a 32 kDa band (2x16 kDa subunits) in western blots of hemoglobin probed with anti-Hb an tibody. This method potentially has much higher sensitivity than adduct analysis sinc e chemiluminescent detection can be used. We have also expanded the project to include studies of the endogenous protection against mustard gas provided by the enzyme, thioether methyltrans ferase. This enzyme methylates the S atom thioethers including mustard gas analogs which renders them nonreactive as alkylating agents. We originally discovered this enzyme in mice, and cloned and sequenced the cDNA from that organism. Using the mouse cDNA as a probe the human thioether methyltransferase cDNA has been cloned from a liver library. Base sequence analysis revealed only one amino acid difference from the mouse. This indicates that our rabbit antiserum against the mouse enzyme can also be used for studies of the tissue distribution of human thioether methyltransferase by western blotting, and such experiments are in progress.

Bell, M.D. Research Focus: Environmental Toxicology Start Date (CY): 1998 Est. Completion (CY): 2001 Brain & Nervous System Interactions OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: To test the neural sensitization/cross-sensitization hypothesis for acquired chemical intolerance (ACI) in Persian Gulf veterans and appropriate controls and to determine individual differences in vulnerability to this process. Neural sensitization is the progressive amplification of a given response over the course of repeated, intermittent exposures to a particular stimulus. As many different classes of stimuli (e.g. chemicals, stress, drugs, microbial toxins) can initiate and elicit sensitized respo nding, cross-sensitization between multiple pre-War, War, and post-War factors could account for the clinical pictures in certain PGW veterans. SPECIFIC AIMS: 1. Evaluate patterns of responsib ility over time of four groups of veterans to repeated jet fuel or sham laboratory exposure s, using blood pressure, heart rate, eye blink (spontaneous and acoustic-startle induced) reac tions as outcome measures. The four groups will include three groups of PGW veterans I) ill with increased chemic al intolerance attributed to military service; ii) ill without increased chemical into lerance; iii) healthy, without increased chemical intolerance; and an additional group of healthy Gulf War era veterans. 2. Assess for cross-sensitization between jet fuel or sham exposures and non-War related chemical exposures (i.e., perfume). 3. Compare veterans by grou ps and by degree of laboratory sensitization for premorbid individual difference characterist ics (host and environment) that would enhance vulnerability to sensitization. METHODOLOGY: The primary between-groups, six- session study of veterans (Ntotal = 200) will compare ill PGW veterans who repo rt increases in acquired chemical intolerance since the Gulf War with three age-, sex-, and education-matched cont rol groups (ill PGW veterans without increased ACI, healthy PGW veterans, healthy era veter ans) for current baseline sensitization and laboratory-induced sensitizab ility and cross-sensitization of neurobehavioral spontaneous eyeblink, acoustic st artle, reaction times, vigilanc e task performance, blood pressure, heart rate) to chemical and nonchemical (e.g., noise) stimuli. The second study will compare premorbid individual difference variables drawn from previous animal and human research that may contribute to suscepti bility to neural sensitization in the four groups and in subjects who did versus those who did not sh ow consistent objective evidence of physiological sensitization and cross-sensitization. Data analyse s will utilize (1) repeated measure, multivariate analyses of variance and covariance and (2) disc riminant analysis and logistic regression involving the individual difference measures. Women and Hisp anics will be oversampled because of evidence of being over represented, respectively, on the national Persian Gulf War Registry and among those on the Tucson VAMC PGW Registry reporting wa rtime environmental contaminant exposures. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES) : Completion of 50 participa nts between 4/98 to 3/99; 90 participants between 4/99 to 3/00; 60 participants and final data analysis, report, and publications in 4/00 to 3/01. Date from this sensitization/cros s-sensitization proposal will prov ide an empirical approach to testing for objective abnormalities in PGW veterans not seen in studies designed from a classical toxicology perspective using similar subs tances. This work could point to a multifactorial pathway by which sensitization- related disorders initiated by chemicals, stress, drugs, microbial toxins, or a combination of these factors during the Gulf War might contribute to the longitudinal development of nonspecific somatic complaints as we ll as of certain medical conditions common in veterans, notably hypertension and its vascular sequelae. Findings will provide a rationale for systematic pharmacological interventions. STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Ongoing. PUBLICATIONS: none to date Persian Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Research Database - Project No VA-49 Title: Sensitivity Pyridostigmine Bromide: Persistent Location: VAMC East Orange Project Status: Ongoing Research Type: P.I.: Richard J. Servatius, Research Focus: Pyridostigmine Bromide Start Date (CY): 1998 Est. Completion (CY): 2002 Brain & Nervous System OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: During the Persi an Gulf War, troops were given access to the experimental agent pyridostigmine bromide as a prophylactic against nerve gas exposure. Usage of pyridostigmine bromide was recommended based on two assumptions: 1) prophylactic levels of pyridostigmine bromide did not alter central nervou s system activity and 2) its peripheral side effects were transient. Our recent research questions these two assumptions. Rats given PB exhibit a persistently exaggerated startle response whic h has a delayed appearance. These findings are without precedent. SPECIFIC AIMS: STUDY A will determine the pharmac okinetics of PB in SD and WKY rats. We will determine if there are strain differences in the rate of clearance from portal and jugular vein administration of C14-labeled PB. We will also determine if there are stra in differences in the degree and duration of inhibition of BuChE activity. STUDY B will compare the effects of two cho linesterase inhibitors, edrophonium (EDRO) and neostigmine (NEO) to PB on measures of erythrocyt e(E-) cholinesterase activity, BuChE activity, and startle responding. Unlike NEO and PB, EDRO does not affect BuChE. We will determine: a) whether the effects of PB are mediated through Bu ChE activity, and b) whether the appearance of delayed-onset startle sensitization is specifically related to PB. STUDY C will provide evidence t hat persistent startle sensitization after exposure to prophylactic levels of PB in rats with abnormal BuChE activity is mediated by central, as opposed to peripheral, nervous system dysfunction. To determine whether central cholinergic activity mediates the delayed-onset startle sensitizat ion observed after pro phylactic PB treatment in WKY rats, we will perform two similar experiments. In Experiment 1, we will addre ss muscarinic receptor mediated cholinergic activity. WKY rats will be given PB, PB and atropine (central and peripheral activity), PB and methylatropine (peripheral activity), the antagonists alone, or tap water. In Experiment 2, we will address nicotinic neurotransmission. WKY ra ts will be given PB, PB and mecamylamine (MEC, centrally active), PB and hexamethonium (HEX, per ipherally active), the antagonists alone, or tap water. For both experiments, startle responses will be measured 1, 8, and 15 days after the end of treatment. Blood samples for BuChE determination will be obtained the day before PB treatment, 4 days after the onset of PB treatment, and the day after the end of PB treatment. In Experiment 3, SD and WKY rats will be given PB treatment or wate r for 7 consecutive days. Rats will be sacrificed either on the last day of treatment or 8 days after the end of treatment. We will determine AChE activity in the cervical spinal chord, hippoca mpus, cortex, and brain stem, as well as blood BuChE activity. STUDY D will determine how long enhanced startle responsivity lasts after appearance and the nature of the enhanced responsivity in rats with abnormal BuChE activity. In Experiment 1, WKY and SD rats will be treated with either PB or tap wa ter for 7 consecutive days. The acoustic startle response will be measured beginning 1 day after the end of treatment and continuing every week until normal startle amplitudes are detected in tw o consecutive weeks. Separate groups of SD and WKY rats will be tested only on the 15th day a fter the end of treatment to determine whether enhanced responsivity is related to repeated test ing. In Experiment 2 WKY and SD rats will be treated as in Experiment 1 except that the single-i ntensity protocol will be used for behavioral testing. In both experiments blood samples for BuChE determination will be obtained the day before PB treatment, 4 days after the onset of PB treat ment, and the day after the end of PB treatment. STUDY E will attempt to produce delayed-onset startle sensitization in rats with otherwise normal BuChE activity. In Experiment 1, half of eac h strain, WKY and SD rats, will be given a single session of tailshock stress. Following stress, rats will be given eith er 7 consecutive days of PB or tap water and vehicle. Acoustic startle responses will be measured 1 day after the end of PB treatment and every week thereafter for 4 weeks. STUDY F will directly evaluate the scavenger hypothesis as a possible mechanism for the persistent startle sensitization in WKY rats. In Experiment 1, WKY rats will be given 7 consecut ive days of either PB, PB with FSB AChE, FSB AChE or tap wa ter. Startle responses will be measured 1, 8, and 15 days after the end of treatment.

Persian Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Research Database - Project No VA-50 Title: Neuropsycholgical findings in a sample of Operation Desert Storm veterans Project #: VA-50 Agency: VA Study Location: VAMC Detroit Axelrod, Ph.D. ch Focus: & Nervous System Start Date (CY): Est. Completion (CY): 1997 OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Objectively eval uate the subjective reports of changes in the cognitive functioning of returning Gulf War veterans. METHODOLOGY: Volunteers for a single Army reserve unit were given a comprehensive neuropsychological and psychological evaluation usin g clinical tools according to each measures' standardized instructions. In response to ongoing complaints of memory, attention, and problem-solving difficulties among veterans of Operation Desert Storm and Shield (ODSS), a sample of 44 male veterans of ODSS underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: Deficits relative to normative data were observed only on finger dexterity (Grooved Pegboard, bilaterally) and the Stroop Color and Word Test. Those with impaired Pegboard performance had lower performance on other tasks requiring psychomotor speed. Those with impaired Stroop had significantly lower moto r and set-shifting performance. Scores of both impaired groups were higher on many clinical and supplemental scales of the MMPI. Despite subjective cognitive complaints reported in 39% of the overall sample, veterans with cognitive complaints differed from their peers primarily in greater psychological distress as depicted on the MMPI. The data represented as preliminary clinical findings. This evaluation was exploratory in nature and two major weaknesses included the sma ll sample size and that the veterans were volunteers. The data should not be misinterpreted as generalizable to all ODSS veterans. The most difficult aspect of interpreting the neuropsycholog ical and psychological data relates to lack of other external data, including possible causes of t he symptoms. The prospective study with objective neuropsychological data of indivi duals who have had a known exposure to specific toxins is an important next step in clinical research.

Persian Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Research Database - Project No VA-51 Title: Psychobiological Assessment of Desert Storm Veterans Project Agency: VA Study Location: VAMC Type: Clinical Research P.I.: Dewleen Baker, M.D. Research Focus: Brain & Nervous System Start Date (CY): 1992 Est. Completion (CY): 2002 Symptoms/General Health OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: While prior st udies show that combat veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) report more physical symptoms than veterans without PTSD, the link between PTSD and somatic complaints in Persian Gulf War veterans (PGWVs) is yet to be evaluated. SPECIFIC AIMS: We examine the relationship of PTSD and somatic complaints in PGWVs, specifically to determine if PGWVs exhibit PTSD effects similar to those observed in veterans of other conflicts and to delineate the specific soma tic complaints accompanying the PTSD symptoms in the Gulf War group. METHODOLOGY: A questionnaire booklet was completed by 188 PGWVs, of whom half were patients in a veterans health screening clinic and half were non-treatment-seeking volunteers on active duty. The booklet included the Combat Expos ure Scale, the Mississippi Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Scale (MPTSD), and a subjective symptom-based health questionnaire. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): TO PGWVs (12.8%) score >116) reported more combat exposure (P=.02) and a greater nu mber of physical symptoms (P=.001) than other PGWVs. Fatigue, nausea, muscle aches, dizziness, back pain, stomach ache, and numbness were much more likely to be reported by those with PTSD (MPTSD score >116) than by <95). Physic ians examining PGWVs should be alert to the possibility of PTSD in this group and that those with PTSD are more likely to report physical sy mptoms that may overlap with those in Persian Gulf sy ndrome. Consequently, mental health screening is essential, since for those veterans with PTSD diagnosis of other coexisting conditions may be confounded and early effective treatment of their PTSD may be delayed. Also, given the increased reporting of certain symptoms by those with PTSD, those seeking the ca use of Persian Gulf syndrome should control for PTSD when determining the symptom cluster that may constitute this condition.

Persian Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Research Database - Project No VA-53 Title: Spouses and Children Program Project #: VA-53 Agency: VA Study Location: VAMC Denver Project Status: Ongoing Under Public Law 103-446, Section 107 the VA was authorized to provide medical examinations to any individual; who: a. Is the spouse or child of a veteran, is listed in the Persian Gulf War Veterans Registry established under Public Law 102-585, Section 702; and is suffering from illness or disorder. b. Is suffering from, or may have suffered from , an illness or disorder (including a birth defect, miscarriage, or stillbirth) which cannot be disassociated from the veteran's service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations. c. Has granted VA permission to include in the R egistry relevant medical data from the evaluation. Under this program, a eligible Gulf War veterans would receive examinations at the local VA Medical Center, and the examinations of spouses and ch ildren would be conducted under contract at the affiliated university medical center. This pr ogram will continue until September 30, 1998 or a maximum of $2.0 m has been expended.

Completion (CY): 1999 *Same as Project VA/DoD-2VA OVERALL PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Between 1955 and 197 5, the U.S. Army enrolled 6,720 soldiers in an experimental exposure program of chem ical warfare and other agents at the Edgewood Arsenal, Maryland. In 1980 the Army asked the National Research Council (NRC) to study the possible long term health effects of these exposur es. A three-volume report was issued, the last volume dealing with the current health status of test subjects, including 1,581 men exposed to anticholinesterase compounds such as GA (tabun), GB (sarin), GD (soman), GF, and VX. The report indicated that \"the limited information available from the follow-up on these soldiers does not permit definitive conclusions regarding the nature and ext ent of possible long-term problems resulting from chemical exposure at Edgewood.\" A pilot study began to determine whether follow-up of these test subjects is feasible and whether it would provide useful information. Taking the suggestion of the NRC committee, we propose to examine the Edgewood subjects who were exposed to anticholinesterase agents for t he more common OP exposure-associated outcomes; neurological deficits, particularly peripheral nerve disease, and neuropsychological impairment, including sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression. SPECIFIC AIMS: METHODOLOGY: The Edgewood subjects who were unex posed to chemical agents will serve as the first control group. However, this is not an ideal control group because the original Edgewood protocol did not include random assignment of s ubjects to treatment and control groups. In particular, it is thought that healthier men were more likel y to have been assigned to chemical exposure groups and less healthy men to the control group. To counte ract the effect of this putative assignment bias, a second control group consisting of men w ho were exposed to chemical agents other than anticholinesterases will also be included in the follow-up. We are proposing a two-phase study that will fi rst screen by telephone questionnaire all exposed subjects and controls for neurological deficit and neuropsychological impairment, including sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression. In the second phase, all individuals and controls who tested positive on any of the neurological deficit or neur opsychological impairment scales, as well as a sample of those who tested negative in each group, will be called in for a clinical examination. The screening would make use of existing data collecti on instruments, such as the Neuropsychological Impairment Scale. EXPECTED PRODUCTS (MILESTONES): STATUS/RESULTS TO DATE: MFUA has discussed the results of this pilot study with the Neurology Dept and the Washington DC VA Medical Center and the Minneapolis MN VA Medical Center. They have agreed to work together if a full-scale study is funded. MFUA will also consult with the staff of the Board on Environmental Studies and Toxicology, National Research Council, with regard to toxicological matters.
