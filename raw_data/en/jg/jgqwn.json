MOON, PH.D. John Gideon Searle Associate Professor moonjj@umich.edu www.umich.edu/~moonlab (734) 936-2570 Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences Department of Biomedical Engineering BioInterfaces Institute University of Michigan 2800 Plymouth Road, NCRC B10-A190 Ann Arbor, MI 48109 PERSONAL STATEMENT My research group aims to develop novel therapeutics at the interface of immunology, pharmaceutics, and engineering. Specifically, we are developing drug delivery systems designed to enhance delivery of antigen and adjuvant to lymphoid organs and manipulate immune functions in the context of vaccine development against infectious pathogens as well as cancer immunotherapy. Our work focusing on the development of nanotechnologies for vaccination has been published in Nature Materials, Nature Medicine, Nature Communications, PNAS, ACS Nano, Sci Transl Med, and Science Advances. Our work has also led to 9 U.S. issued or pending patent applications as well as two startup biotech companies, Vedantra Pharmaceuticals (Cambridge, MA) and EVOQ Therapeutics (Ann Arbor, MI).
