Wayne Liebelt, a naturopath in the Mount Barker area, authored an article in the Adelaide Hills Herald on June 24 which labelled COVID-19 vaccines as \"anti-science, anti-human and evil\". Five days later, the Health and Community Services Complaints Commissioner (HCSCC) received a complaint from a member of the public about the article. Following an investigation, Commissioner Grant Davies issued an interim prohibition order against Mr Liebelt. Coming into effect on July 29, the order prohibits Mr Liebelt from providing health services \"in respect of health education and/or the provision of information related to COVID vaccinations\". It also prohibits the naturopath from providing advice in relation to the provision of the specified health services of COVID-19 vaccination. The order lasts for 12 weeks. Associate Professor Davies said even unregistered health care workers are held to community expectations. \"The Code of Conduct exists to ensure unregistered health care workers do not pose a risk to the health or safety of members of the South Australian public,\" Associate Professor Davies said. \"Therefore, I have decided to investigate this matter as I am concerned with what Mr Liebelt has expressed in this article.\" Mr Liebelt has not been suspended from offering other naturopath services, only the specific terms surrounding COVID-19 vaccinations in the order. 9news.com.au has contacted Mr Liebelt for comment.
