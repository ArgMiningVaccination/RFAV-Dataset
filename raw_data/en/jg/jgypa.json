It took us a few years, but finally we've found three essential oils to help round out a stressful day. At the time of my daughter's ADHD diagnosis, treatment options were limited. Stimulant medications were, by and large, the only choice. Still today, the [American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends treating ADHD in children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 with FDA-approved medications](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/guidelines.html), plus parent training in behavior modification and behavioral classroom interventions. Still, I wanted to know whether we had additional ADHD treatment options for my child. I remember doctors looking at me cross-eyed when I brought up any alternative therapies. They made me feel guilty for broaching the subject \u2014 as if my desire to explore other avenues threatened their medical authority. I found scant support or guidance for holistic ADHD therapies, yet I knew in my gut there had to be another way. And through years of trial and error, my intuition was validated as we found that complementary therapies, like essential oils, work best to help my daughter manage her ADHD, anxiety, and mood disorder. (Note: No scientific research confirms the efficacy of essentials oils in lessening symptoms of ADHD.) She uses [essential oils](https://www.additudemag.com/treatment/essential-oils/) in conjunction with a mindfulness routine that, many days, works like a life preserver keeping her buoyed above a stressful day. [ [Learn More About Essential Oils](https://www.additudemag.com/treatment/essential-oils/?src=embed_link)] The Essential Oils We Use for ADHD Symptoms We mix essential oils with carrier oils, like coconut oil, and apply it to her skin - being careful to avoid sensitive areas like the eyes, inner ears, and cuts or scrapes. We also vaporize the essential oils in a diffuser that creates a fine mist and scents the space. My daughter prefers to \"wear\" essential oils in a pendant she can smell discretely throughout the day. She relies on three oils in particular: - Lavender oil is well known for its calming properties. When my daughter is feeling anxious or nervous at the end of a stressful day, she applies it to the bottom of her feet or puts it in a diffuser to help her to sleep soundly. - Peppermint oil boosts mental focus and helps increase energy when used midday. My daughter adds it to coconut oil and rubs it on sore muscles after a workout. - Finally, Vetiver oil is known as the oil of tranquility and, when combined with lavender, promotes enduring emotional balance. It's one of my daughter's favorites to add to bath water for a relaxing soak.
