Healthy eating produces the best results when you've synched it up with a dynamic workout plan like the ones in [BodyFit](https://www.bodybuilding.com/workout-plans2/all-plans). Use these five pillars of nutrition as guideposts to help you on your journey: Eat Throughout the Day: Yes, you can grow muscle or lose weight on three meals a day. But for many of us, it's more effective to use multiple small meals and [healthy snacks](https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/26-best-healthy-snacks.html)spread throughout the day help you fuel your body and keep your blood-sugar levels under control as your metabolism adapts to the stimulus from training.

If you're like most people, you'll find your workouts feel better, your cravings will decrease, and you'll see the difference in the mirror! Stay Hydrated: [Drink water](https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/water_calculator.htm)and calorie-free beverages to keep your body at peak performance. Avoid sugar-laden drinks that sabotage your body's defense systems. Craving sweet drinks? Low-calorie [branched-chain Carbs come in two forms: starchy, faster-action options such as rice, bread, and pasta that raise the blood sugar quickly; and non-starchy carbs like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, which are higher in fiber and raise blood sugar gradually. Non-starchy carbs should be the backbone of your [carb intake](https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/calcarbs.htm). The timing of when you eat starchy carbs is key to getting and maintaining a lean and muscular body. They're best before or [immediately after your workouts](https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/the-benefits-of-post-workout-carbohydrates.html), when you can use them as fuel or to replenish muscle glycogen. Eat Plenty of Lean Protein: You can maximize muscle growth while stimulating the release of fat-burning hormones by eating protein every few hours. If you're only going to measure one macronutrient, [make it this one](https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/calpro.htm)! While [high-protein foods](https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/ultimate-list-40-high-protein-foods.html)should always be your first priority, a [quality protein powder](https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/the-best-protein-powders-of-2021.html)is an easy, healthy way to meet your protein goals each day. Consider whey protein between meals and a [slow-digesting casein protein](https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/the-perfect-casein-protein-recipe-to-have-at-night.html)as a shake or pudding to help fuel your gains at night.
