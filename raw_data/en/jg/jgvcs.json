Turns out, over the course of four to five days, the average person spends between 5 and 10 hours scrubbing and dusting away, according to the latest [Spring Cleaning Survey](https://blog.thumbtack.com/our-ultimate-spring-cleaning-guide-129c68b73c3a) by [Thumbtack](https://cna.st/affiliate-link/8UAFzxJzvSuamSG7dv76aHrd5hBNDoBBeut7ectoKgJVa6Ss6W8PrhJZDgKzmPnqYioko6GAfpR58yBq5CroE51P8w8Ciy92zXRvUF5Ya2ERDUWgho3MzJWBdSYZs8SdKVNKUe9VxYTuKNCAvQcLGMKhoyX9CYsdUPoQUQd1hD5BTbyihDr), a home care app. That means if you're sensitive to harsh chemicals in multisurface cleaners and other foaming cleaning solutions, [dealing with grime](https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/how-to-eliminate-dust-from-every-surface-in-your-home) in your house can be quite a headache, literally. What's more, some disinfectant sprays and wipes [release toxins](https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/cleaning-products-hurt-air-quality), potentially triggering allergies. That's one of the reasons Devon Holmes, a Thumbtack pro with [Uncommon Solutions](https://cna.st/affiliate-link/bvaxwx9ZxZzcR8VhPvU2MA9WXBJmx7frCpmwxMhcWzqchP4Qxf1M3Xb2KRhPtMDsmN2fHc9zg8zuaSqXSiNndDGNWaZKj8RPeXc4JntoYpy4tVVCuypbeKH4A8ej5Hzc69iMtAqnNwXGBCijfLwvJW15DXGwZiFTf6MLQ9jrzxMHALJfiKffQfFG1mp8Xqo8trPwGspT633A8Zait83ybnaDcLFQUfJWua1Q8ischhcMgkdazZqhKh2J8uv), switched over to making his own cleaning products. The traditional formulas tended to irritate his skin and throat after a long day of cleaning. These days, his cleaning supplies use basic ingredients. \"For example, baking soda is a great odor eliminator and whitener,\" Holmes says. \"When mixed with white vinegar, it is also a powerful cleaning combination for many purposes. All in all, the most anyone truly needs for everyday cleaning is vinegar, alcohol, baking soda, dish soap, and some cleaning tools.\" He also adds essential oils to his eco-friendly cleaning formulas since they have disinfecting and antibacterial properties and add a nice natural scent to the cleaning experience. One of his favorite DIY products is a glass cleaner, which consists of alcohol, white vinegar, distilled water, and essential oils. For those who prefer not to concoct cleaning solutions but still want the eco-friendly version, AD has been on the hunt for cleaning products you can feel good about using at home, especially if you have little kids or pets. We found ready-to-use earth-friendly products that will get the job done without harsh chemicals. And we are not the only ones interested in sustainable, plant-based ingredients that can KO a serious mess. According to research from Google Trends, people are searching for eco-friendly cleaning products: The top searched term in the US this past year is \"eco-friendly laundry detergent\" and other top trending terms include \"eco-friendly disinfectant\" and \"eco-friendly carpet cleaner.\" Search interest in \" [biodegradable soap](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=biodegradable%20soap)\" in the category of cleaning supplies and services more than doubled in the past year. We did our homework and put dozens of natural cleaning products\u2014sans parabens, phthalates, and phosphates\u2014to the test by wiping smudges off a glass dining room table and windows in a playroom, scrubbing away stubborn stains on countertops, and running load after load of dishes to find a perfect dishwasher detergent that will get rid of grease without leaving a chalky residue.

Just a few spritzes of Safely Universal Cleaner leave the kitchen a fragrant bouquet that isn't too citrusy or too floral.

We love to use it at the end of the day to get rid of fingerprints on the stainless steel fridge and to wipe away splatters off of countertops with a [Cloud Paper bamboo paper towel](https://cna.st/affiliate-link/TdsMtFs7CeQKr2YuBzfXNmX1F1vkTGemUWvZcSwzDWonZ7i2n1SQAN8pxSwzmmDyCKXnqBk71djLiqTLExV2dH7NkoDtLTnCz69CM5c8WP3u2breHNxzLe45G8i1MCKETTdjSU3VtqvVTW9XSjvgTApgbQ7KoJpCxAec4dCWkstZ1Ry5wRiHD2PgsX8aVkFNycP2HkFyCUGmma) or a Swedish cloth. But really, it smells so good you will want to spray it everywhere. Mix this biodegradable powder with a bit of water to make a paste that banishes stuck-on stains with the power of plant-based ingredients like lavender and tea tree essential oils. (Tea tree oil is know to be a disinfectant). We used it to to get rid of a tea stain on a laminate countertop and as a floor cleaner to lift stuck-on spots around the stove. Bonus points: The [EWG gave AspenClean SuperScrub an A](https://www.ewg.org/guides/cleaners/6043-AspenCleanSuperScrubPowder/) and it comes in a 100% recycled bottle, not a single-use plastic destined for a landfill. A true hero of sustainable cleaning. A lot of dishes went into testing dishwasher products without harsh chemicals. We love Grove Co. Total Clean Dishwasher Detergent Packs for dealing with food stains, even stuck-on oatmeal and greasy pots used to make dumplings.

Dr. Bronner's soap is made with organic oils and fair trade ingredients. It works on basically everything: house and body. You can dilute it in a bucket of water and use it as a floor cleaner or make a cleaning spray for windows and other household surfaces. We love to use it to rejuvenate oven racks. All you need to do is fill up a bathtub with hot water, then add Dr. Bronner's fragrance-free castile soap, and soak the dirty oven racks for at least two hours. Use steel wool to remove the brown residue. (It helps if you put old towels on the bottom so you won't have to clean the tub after).

You can also leave it your fridge or freezer and it will absorb any odor. You can even use baking soda for pest control.

The compact scrub brush starter set of four is your answer to a zero-waste kitchen. Two of the brushes are made from stiff coconut fiber bristles that work great on cast iron pans, stuck-on messes, and as a tool to brush off dry food plates before placing them in the dishwasher. The other two are made from a gentler sisal fiber, which won't scratch non-stick cookware and glass. We use them instead of sponges to erase coffee stains from mugs. A paper towel works great in a pinch, but it is no secret that sustainability is not its forte. On the other hand, cellulose sponge cloths (also known as Swedish dishcloth) can be used to wipe up messes again and again. Each reusable cloth can last up to six months\u2014just wash it with your clothes or in the dishwasher. It's safe on everything from marble to tile to stainless steel to wood surfaces.

We've been turning to brands like [Branch Basics](https://cna.st/affiliate-link/PyEg6iPaqW4ss18qw1x8Q2VYBbLM1rzuYE5MQNDiWqmH2uoodB7PBsythcbSH5qcAd27djzkFcUrEMbB69wLrmtuq6RtTGwTdu1p667QuQiiNhHq9wFpwdGU), a female-founded cleaning supply company that makes a plant-and-mineral-based concentrate for cleaning pretty much every part of the house. We appreciate the BPA-free, reusable spray bottles and the biodegradable, non-harmful formula. The Branch Basics Oxygen Boost powder is a favorite, not only does it work on laundry stains without having to rely on bleach, ammonia, fragrances or dyes, use it to make a paste that will banish yellow and moldy stains from grout. In between scrubs, you can pop these toilet bowl cleaner tablets into your tank. With every flush, the tablet releases a bit of bleach into the tank, providing constant cleanings. Swap them out every two to three months. Best eco-friendly cleaning products for the living room L'Avant wipes are one of those natural cleaning products you want to buy by the dozen.

Use the all-purpose cleaner to tackle dust and more. This no-wax, nontoxic, plant-based wood floor cleaner is super easy to use, dries quickly and doesn't require any rinsing. It's also one of the best things we've ever smelled. It's available in three scents: almond, spearmint sage, and lemon ginger. (They're all delicious, but almond is our favorite.) It's also available in a spray bottle, which is perfect for when you just need to clean a spot on your floor rather than the whole thing. Best eco-friendly cleaning products for the laundry room Dirty Labs products are 1,4 dioxane-free, California Prop 65 chemical-free, and are hypoallergenic. But that's not the only reason we love them, the scent Magnolia (with notes of bergamot, and cedar) and Murasaki (inspired by the early spring green tea harvest in Japan with notes of jasmine, matcha, and vetiver) will make you want to wash your sheets, along with everything else, nonstop.
