In Texas, fall moves into winter with plenty of vacillating weather making it difficult for our bodies to adjust, then bang - cold weather is here! Our immune and respiratory systems need strong natural support during this time, and regular acupuncture is an excellent way to provide that support. In Chinese Medicine the immune system is strongly related to internal organ function, mainly the Lungs and Spleen which need extra care during the winter season. When these organs are well-balanced they support the immune system and strengthen its function, this prevents you from being easily affected by external pathogenic factors such as cold and flu viruses and other infectious diseases. A long winters \"acu-nap,\" helps to calm and relax the body, reducing extra stress that can come with the winter and holiday season, and boosting immunity to help you sustain good health. In addition to Acupuncture, plenty of rest, and daily exercise help keep healthy energies flowing strongly, and remember a diet, full of nutrition is vital to good health.
