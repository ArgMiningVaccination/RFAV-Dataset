(Michigan.gov)Christopher Ledtke, M.D. Infectious Disease Munson Healthcare in Michigan COVID -19 Variants The variants are more contagious and deadly, infecting more adults and children, and bringing more young people into hospitals than ever. Daily pediatric COVID -19 admissions have increased by 237% since Feb. 19. Currently, nearly 50 children are hospitalized in Michigan with COVID -19. Every day, an average of nine children are admitted to our hospitals. Children are notimmune to COVID -19 nor are they immune to the long -term impacts of complications like multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS -C). Severe cases of MIS -C have occurred even in children who presented without symptoms of COVID -19. The long -term health impacts of COVID -19 or MIS -C can be devastating. We have seen heartbreaking stories of children on ventilators, experiencing amputation and more. Even one case is too many. (www.mha.org)COVID -19 and Quarantine If I am exposed to the virus, how long do I have to quarantine? People who have been exposed to someone with COVID -19 must quarantine and monitor themselves for symptoms for 14 days following exposure. If you show any symptoms of the virus, you should immediately isolate and get tested. Due to increasing case rates and variant spread in Michigan, MDHHS has reinstated a standard 14-day quarantine for close contacts of COVID -19 cases. This will remove the option of reducing quarantine to 10 days, effective April 5, 2020. Quarantine instructions for people who are fully vaccinated: Fully vaccinated persons who meet criteria are no longer be required to quarantine following an exposure to someone with COVID -19. Individuals should keep their COVID -19 Vaccination Record Card to confirm their exemption from quarantine. Federal Government allocating vaccine to retail pharmacies.

Vaccine manufacturers conduct these studies as part of the development, testing, and approval process. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) uses the information from clinical trials to decide if a vaccine is safe, effective, and ready to be licensed for use . Post -licensure safety studies are conducted after a vaccine is approved and in use. These studies are part of continuous vaccine safety monitoring and often look at populations that might be underrepresented in clinical trials. Importantly, these studies can look for rare adverse events . www.cdc.govCOVID -19 Vaccination Efficacy: Safety and Monitoring : V-safe:Get vaccinated. Get your smartphone. Get started with v -safe.
