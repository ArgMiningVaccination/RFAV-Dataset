All statements are merely the opinion of the writer(s). We recommend that patients follow their doctor's guidance in regard to anti-anxiety measures. The Chill Pill is a physical, handheld device used for stress relief. Its manufacturer claims that by using it, you can \"say goodbye to synthetic pills and hello to natural, effective relief.\" But does the Chill Pill contain research-backed technology or are these just marketing claims? How does the device actually work? What retailer sells it for the best price? And how do real users rate and describe the effects of the Chill Pill? In this article we'll answer all of these questions and more as we analyze the tech behind the Chill Pill to give our take on whether it's likely to be effective for stress relief or if it's a waste of money. We'll also provide a cost comparison featuring the retailer that sells the Chill Pill for the best price, and share real, unsponsored Chill Pill user reviews. Is Chill Pill Proven to Work? Chill Pill doesn't appear to have been studied in any clinical trials, so we'll have to evaluate its potential efficacy based on how the manufacturer describes the device. Unfortunately, the manufacturer of this device provides very little information in regard to the mechanism of action. On the \"How it Works\" page of the Chill Pill website, the brand describes its technology as \"pressure point stimulation,\" as shown below: Various forms of pressure point stimulation have been studied in some clinical trials. A [meta-study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26002571/) published in the Acupuncture in Medicine journal analyzed the effectiveness of acupressure for anxiety and found that the treatment provided \"immediate relief.\" As we documented in our review of [BeActive Plus](https://illuminatelabs.org/blogs/health/beactive-plus-review), acupressure is also clinically shown to reduce pain scores. The issue is that Chill Pill fails to explain the type and location of pressure points that are stimulated and at what force. Just because some acupressure methods can relieve anxiety does not mean that all pressure point stimulation methods will. Essentially, we consider Chill Pill potentially effective, but because the brand fails to explain how their device works it seems illogical to purchase. But how do real users rate and describe the effects of Chill Pill? We'll review in the next section. Real, Unsponsored Chill Pill User Reviews A YouTube creator named \"Sew Geek Mama\" has a review of the Chill Pill that includes a demonstration on how to use the device as well as her thoughts on the pros and cons (including negative impact on sleep): A TikTok user named Jenny Haley who claims to suffer from anxiety and panic disorder shared her experience using the device: [@askjeevees]Sorry it took a while- I wanted to [#anxiety] [#mentalhealthmatters] Night Trouble - SelteMemset] Where to Buy Chill Pill for the Best Price Chill Pill is sold at a variety of online retailers. Here's a price breakdown at the time of publishing this article: Brand website: $65 (free shipping) Smart Life Gadgets: $49.50 (plus shipping) Amazon: $50 (free shipping depending on plan - [link to official Amazon listing](https://amzn.to/3KcsWkm)) The Chill Pill is currently 23% cheaper on Amazon than on the brand's official website. Real Customers Review Chill Pill Amazon is a better resource for real customer reviews than a brand's website in our opinion. Chill Pill has been reviewed over 450 times and has an unimpressive average rating of 2.2 out of 5 stars. The top positive review from a verified purchaser comes from a user named \"Keo Hilihili\" who claims that the device improved the mental health of their child: \"I have an adult child who is mentally ill...This gadget is the best thing we have ever had her use. It has kept us away from the ER. It has allowed us to finish a restaurant meal or run a complete list of errands. My voice has been saved. Her therapist is thrilled she has it. Her psychiatrist is happy he hasn't had to figure out a medication to add to her regimen or to completely have to reorganize all her meds.\" The top negative review from a verified purchaser is written by a user named \"Marilyn Phinazee\" who claims the device is ineffective: \"I got the chill pill and read the instructions and tried it the same night and I felt NOTHING so I tried putting on a different hand and again nothing so I tried to return it and was told that it couldn't be returned because of the oils in the machine...I give this item a -0 because it doesn't work.\" Mind Your Mental, the manufacturer of Chill Pill, has an average review rating of 1 out of 5 stars on the Better Business Bureau (BBB) [website](https://www.bbb.org/us/md/laytonsville/profile/mental-health-services/mend-your-mental-0241-236059484), which is the worst possible rating. It's a small sample size so this isn't particularly concerning, but at the time of publishing this article the brand has failed to respond to any negative reviews or customer complaints. This is a red flag of a low-quality brand in our opinion. Does Chill Pill Cause Side Effects? Since the Chill Pill doesn't appear to have been studied in any clinical trials, we can't say for certain whether or not it will cause side effects. However, given that it's a hardware device and is not ingested, we consider the risk of side effects to be very low. It's hard to imagine how using this device could cause side effects, although perhaps if it's manufactured incorrectly it could apply too much pressure and cause pain. We haven't seen any customer reports of side effects online, and there is no mention of side effects on the brand's website. Can Tea Naturally Induce Relaxation? There are several types of tea which are actually clinically shown to help drinkers relax. Green tea was shown in a 2017 [clinical trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28566632/) to significantly reduce stress levels, and has been used to promote mental and physical wellness for centuries. [Pique Japanese Sencha Green Tea](https://piquelife.sjv.io/DVY5Gj) is our top green tea pick. It costs $16 for 14 servings, or only $1.14 per serving.

Reishi mushroom was shown in an [animal study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3879659/) to have antidepressant and anti-anxiety effects. This is not as strong of a standard of evidence as a human trial, but a 2016 [medical review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28008811/) states that this mushroom has been used by traditional cultures to reduce stress for many years.
