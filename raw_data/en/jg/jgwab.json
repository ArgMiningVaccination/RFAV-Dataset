First illustrated medical book. Published in Lucknow in 1908G. \u00b7 A;Zahrawi's surgical procedures and instruments are still applied in medicine today (?plagiarism / intellectual property?) \u00b7 We should not be complacent with the achievements of the past. AlZahrawi inspires us to write the future while reading our history. \u00b7 Innovative and creative. Combination of reading the 2 books 'kitaab al wahy' and 'kitaab al kawn' AMONG FIRSTS OF ALZAHRAWI \u00b7 Description of [ectopic pregnancy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopic_pregnancy), cervical dilatation \u00b7 Identification of the hereditary nature of [haemophilia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilia) [[1]](https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=8286997446934926659#_edn1), \u00b7 Description of a surgical procedure for ligating the temporal artery for migraine \u00b7 evacuation of hydrocephalus [[2]](https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=8286997446934926659#_edn2) \u00b7 Use of [catgut](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catgut)for internal stitching is still practised in modern surgery SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS \u00b7 Inspection of urethral interior \u00b7 Rremoving foreign bodies from the throat \u00b7 Inspection of the ear \u00b7 Cannulas \u00b7 Hooks with a double tip for surgery \u00b7 Use of [forceps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forceps)in vaginal deliveries and extraction of dead fetus FIRSTS NOT CREDITED \u00b7 Because of limited translations into modern western languages Al Zahrawi's achievements were not widely known [[3]](https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=8286997446934926659#_edn3) \u00b7 \"Kocher's method\" for treating a dislocated shoulder \u00b7 \"Walcher position\" in [obstetrics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetrics). \u00b7 No charges of plagiarism / violation of intellectual property were made PERSONAL DIMENSION \u00b7 Positive [doctor-patient relationship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor-patient_relationship) \u00b7 Affectionate with his students, whom he referred to as \"my children\" \u00b7 Emphasized the importance of treating patients irrespective of their social status. \u00b7 Encouraged the close observation of individual cases in order to make the most accurate diagnosis and the best possible treatment. \u00b7 The historian AlHumaidhi in his book 'jadhwat al muqtabas fi akhbaar ulamaa al andalus' that AlZahrawi was religious. \u00b7 He was known to set aside half of the day to treat the poor for free WHAT MADE ALZHRAWI GREAT? evidence-based medicine \u00b7 Two lessons from AlZahrawi: empirical evidence-based knowledge (hujjiyat al burhan/daliil) and a holistic approach to medicine (shumuliyyat) \u00b7 AlZahrawi was a great researcher and based his work on empirical evidence. \u00b7 Insisted on dissection. \u00b7 In the introduction to tasrif he said that the book contained what he experiences and tried out in 50 years. \u00b7 Muslims inspired by the Qur'an to follow daliil and burhan and to look in the universes around them for signs of Allah, ayat al Allah fi al kawn WHAT MADE ALZHRAWI GREAT? holistic medicine \u00b7 AlZahrawi worked within the shummuli / holistic context of Islam. \u00b7 Islam is a complete system with guidelines for all aspects of life \u00b7 The guidelines are general conceptual principles leaving a lot of room for human effort by ijtihad to extend the frontiers of knowledge \u00b7 Holism or shumuliyat are based on tauhid TAUHID: INTRODUCTION encapsulates integrative [al uluhiyyat.](https://www.blogger.com/null) \u00b7 Tauhid has implications for our daily life based on issuing from one creator: brotherhood and equality, consistent and harmonious physical, social, economic, political laws as well as holistic medical care. \u00b7 Tauhid provides a paradigmatic basis for resolving problem/crisis of duality of knowledge, azmatizdiwajiyat al ma'arifat, towards integration of knowledge, takamul al ma'arifat \u00b7 Tauhid provides a paradigm for research, teaching, and practice of basic medical sciences, clinical sciences, and medical professionalism TAUHID: EPISTEMOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS \u00b7 Knowledge crisis = dichotomy in the education system: traditional Islamic vs. imported European. Students and their teachers are confused by the contradictory world-views presented by the two systems \u00b7 The mission of the knowledge strategy is conceptual transformation of the education system from kindergarten to post graduate studies to reflect the tauhidicintegrative paradigm, positive moral values, objectivity, universality, and serving the larger causes of humanity. \u00b7 Many efforts towards an integrated education system are acknowledged such as IIIT, IIUM, other Islamic universities, FWCII etc: there are conceptual & practical problems not yet resolved but we have come a long way. TAUHID: BIOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS \u00b7 Tauhid explains the perfection, optimality, order, harmony, consistency, co-ordination, and purposive ness and of body structure and physiology \u00b7 Tauhid explains the consistency of the physical and social laws, sunan al kawn, that underlie biological phenomena of order (thabaat) and change (taghyiir) such as homeostasis and negative feedback in human physiology referable to the Qur'anic concepts of balance (mizan), equilibrium (e'itidal), and action-reaction (tadafu'u) \u00b7 The purpose of scientific research is to discover (basic science) and exploit (technology) the sunan al kawn \u00b7 Study of biology reveals signs of Allah (ayatkawniyyat) in biology: perfection (kamal al khalq), incomparability ('azj al shurakaa), functional unity (C-C-C) based on the nervous and endocrine systems to be read alongside Qur'anic signs (ayatqur'aniyyat) TAUHID: REJECTION OF MATERIALISM IN MEDICINE \u00b7 Health is holistic including spiritual health, physical health, psychological and mental health, and social health all properly balanced. The human body as integrated physiological entity that all suffers if any part is injured. \u00b7 The biomedical model (BMM) in modern medicine was characterized by focus on: the physical and rejection of the psychosocial and spiritual, disease and not illness, disease and not health, quantity and not quality of life, organ pathology and not the whole patient. \u00b7 BMM commodizes health, medicalizes life, demystifies the human body, dehumanizes the patient as a machine, depersonalizes the patient as a pathology, and lacks balance and equilibrium, TAUHID: PARADIGM SHIFT: THE BIOMEDICAL TO THE HOLISTIC - Lack of integration due to atomistic view of the cosmos: analytic but not synthetic - Integration is not addition but is fitting according to the laws, sunan \u00b7 Tauhid motivates the shift from the biomedical to the holistic model that looks at thepatient, the disease, and the environment as one system that is in equilibrium; \u00b7 Tauhid motivates looking at a patient as one organism and not a convenient combination of organs and pathologies. The patient has physical, social, psychological, and spiritual dimensions that have to be considered together in an integrated, holistic, and balanced fashion. TAUHIDI and HOLISTIC MEDICINE (HM) \u00b7 HM is defined as medicine that focuses on the 'whole person' and not the malady itself. It considers physical, social, psychological, and spiritual aspects of disease \u00b7 It was the mainstream form of medicine in all ages (Islamic medicine, unani medicine) until marginalized by scientific medicine to become a form of alternative medicine \u00b7 Integrative medicine is when a physician of modern medicine integrates a holistic approach \u00b7 Return to holistic medicine is return to tauhidi medicine TAJDID & ISLAH \u00b7 This ummat experiences periods of growth and periods of decline but it always rises up \u00b7 There is a renewal in each century. This renewal is based on reform of knowledge and education REFERENCES [[3]](https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=8286997446934926659#_ednref3) "}
