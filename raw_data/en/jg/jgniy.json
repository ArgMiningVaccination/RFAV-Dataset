Further development and contentcame from the workshop itself. The idea of the booklet was then taken out to focus groups of first contact workers, conducted in partnership by OPMHAN and CAMH in Thunder Bay , Toronto, Casselman and Ottawa in winter 2004. Participants in these groupstalked about the challenges of working with older adults with mental healthand addiction problems, and about what they needed to help them in theirwork. We hope this booklet begins to address those needs. Once a draft for the booklet was in process, more people became involved in its development. Drafts were reviewed by members of the CAMH Healthy Aging Project Team, by external experts and, nally , by members of the booklet's target audience. The comments and suggestions provided by these reviewershelped to shape and rene the draft. Development, research and writing of the booklet was by Michelle Maynes, and the illustrations and design were created by Mara Korkola, both of Education & Publishing at CAMH . The impetus and funding for the development of this publication grew out of CAMH 's commitment to recognizing diversity . Many , many thanks to all who gave their time, insight, expertise, artistry and support to this project.

This booklet is for people who work with older adults in their homes, in the community and in long-term care. This includespersonal support workers, health care aides, meals-on-wheelsand friendly visitor volunteers, and staff at seniors' centres,residences, apartments and nursing homes. This booklet is alsofor people who supervise or educate rst contact staff. Somereaders may have more or less training and experience thanothers, but all work in close contact with older people. Why have we written this booklet for you? The work you do as a worker or volunteer is important. Theservices you provide and the attention you give to older adultsare essential to their care, their dignity and their quality of life.The work you do also helps to support the families of olderadults, who may not be able to provide care themselves. This booklet was written in recognition of some of the challenges you face in your important work, and to offer information thatmay help you to better understand and feel more comfortablewith certain older adults. It can be hard to know what to sayor do when you see older adults who behave in ways that makeyou think they may have a substance use, mental health orgambling problem. You may not be sure what to look for, how to talk to the person about it or what you can do. Since you work in close personal contact with older adults, you may be the rst to notice a problem. If the problem is mild, you 1may be able to help the older adult yourself. When it is more severe, you may need to tell others who can help. As the rstcontact, you can make a difference. Your approach can influencehow older adults feel about themselves, about their difcultiesand about you and others. How you respond to older adults canhelp to build trust. This can make it easier for them to accepthelp from you or from others, such as doctors or social workers. There is much to know about substance use, mental health and gambling issues that affect older adults. This booklet won't makeyou an expert, but it will give you a lot of important practicalinformation that can help you in your work. 21 The Nature of Aging Who are older adults? Some say an older adult is anyone over 55 years old; others say it is anyone over 60 or 65. No matter wherethe starting line is drawn, the age of older adults spans up to 70,80, 90, even 100 years ormore. Older adults can bemany years apart in age,with very different back-grounds and experiences.No two lives are thesame, and no twoolder adults are the same. 3However, people experience some common changes and challenges as they grow older. What is natural aging? As people age, there are natural changes to the body and mind.For example: \u00b7Hair becomes grey , skin wrinkles, hearing and weaken;physical strength lessens, movement and reaction time becomeslower. \u00b7Learning new skills and recalling information may take longer (how - ever, vocabulary continues to grow and personality stays the same).In addition, stressful life events (e.g., retirement, leaving the familyhome, the death of friends and family) tend to increase, while thesocial support of friends, family and colleagues tends to decrease. Age-related health problems Certain health problems are more common among older adults.The older people who need your help are more likely to be frailor to have other health problems. These include: \u00b7dementias, such as Alzheimer disease \u00b7osteoporosis loss \u00b7high blood pressure \u00b7heart disease \u00b7stroke \u00b7Parkinson's disease. 4Responding to Older AdultsThe Nature of Aging Physical health, emotions and behaviour Physical health problems can also affect a person's emotions and behaviour. For example: \u00b7Pain can affect mood. \u00b7Hearing loss can result in misunderstanding. \u00b7Parkinson's disease, dementia and stroke can make it difcult forpeople to speak, which may make them frustrated. \u00b7Parkinson's disease, dementia and stroke can also cause changesin personality and behaviour. What is the problem? It's often difcult to know why an older person behaves in waysthat seem odd or challenging. It's especially difcult if you don'tknow the person well and only see him or her for short periodsof time. Even if you do know the person well, there can be morethan one explanation for the behaviour. Often only a doctorcan determine the cause. For example, illness, a substance useproblem, a mental health problem or a combination of thesefactors may cause: \u00b7depression, irritability or delusions \u00b7confusion, disorientation or memory \u00b7slurring of words \u00b7stumbling and falls \u00b7sleep problems \u00b7change in appetite \u00b7spending more time alone. What is causing the problem? It's important to understand that the cause of these behavioursmay notbe part of the natural aging process. For example, cause could be: \u00b7alcohol issues \u00b7anxiety \u00b7dementia \u00b7depression \u00b7gambling problems \u00b7medication issues. Each of these areas will be explored in this booklet. But rst, try the following quiz to check your knowledge of aging. Aging myths and facts True or false? 1. The older you get, the less sleep you need. T F2. People take more medications as they age. T F3. As your body changes with age, so does your personality . T F4. Intelligence declines with age. T F5. Most older people live alone. T F6. Most people get dementia if they live long enough. T F7. Senior women have the lowest income of all adult groups. T F8. Most older adults have no interest in, or capacity for, T F sexual relations. 9. Many older people are preoccupied with death. T F10. Most seniors who are new to Ontario speak neither T F English nor French. Answers 1. False. In later life, the quality of sleep may decline, but not 6Responding to Older Adultsthe total sleep time. As people age, they are likely to take more naps rather than sleep for long stretches. 2. True. Most older Canadians take at least one kind of prescription or over-the-counter medication. Older people are also morelikely than younger adults to take more than one medication. 3. False. A person's personality stays the same throughout life, except when changes result from Alzheimer disease or otherforms of dementia, stroke or other serious illness. 4. False. Most people's intellect stays the same or improves with age, although it may take longer for older people to learnsomething new. 5. False. Most Canadian seniors live with their spouse, common law partner, extended family or others. In 1996, only 29 percent of older people lived alone. 6. False. Dementia is not a normal part of aging. 7. True. In 2001, 46 per cent of widowed, single or divorced women aged 65 and older lived below the poverty line. Thisis the highest poverty rate of any family type in Canada. 8. False. Aging does not necessarily change a person's interest in or capacity for sexual relations. However, ways of expressingsexual feelings may change, and opportunities for sexualrelations may decline due to the loss of a partner, or changesin health or living arrangements. 9. False. Attitudes toward death vary , but often older adults are less anxious and more matter-of-fact about death. As theysee others close to them die, they begin to accept their ownmortality , and tend to speak more freely about death and dying. 7The Nature of Aging10. True. Of the more than 6,000 senior immigrants to Ontario from 1996 to 1999, 64 per cent of women and 56 per cent ofmen spoke neither English nor French. Adapted from Ontario Seniors' Secretariat: Aging Quiz .Reprinted with permission. Discussing diversity You may work with people who have very different backgrounds and experiences from yours. Some of these differences may include: \u00b7age \u00b7ethnocultural background or nationality \u00b7language \u00b7religion or sexual orientation (e.g., heterosexual,gay , lesbian). Some differences may make you uncomfortable at first. But if you get to know and understand a person, you will often discoveryou have more in common than you thought. In this section, we look briefly at two areas that can affect your relationship with the older adults you work with. Ethnocultural diversity There are more than 200 ethnocultural groups in Canada(National Advisory Council on Aging, 2005). Each group has its own values and beliefs that affect how people act, relate toothers, deal with illness and pain, and think about life anddeath. Because of these different values and beliefs, behaviour 8Responding to Older Adultsthat is acceptable to some people may make others uncomfortable. Chances are you probably work with older adults who come fromgroups other than your own. Some common differences include: \u00b7language \u00b7religion \u00b7clothing \u00b7diet \u00b7touch \u00b7tone of voice \u00b7attitudes about age \u00b7attitudes about substance use and mental health \u00b7attitudes about accessing health care \u00b7the role of adult children in caring for aging parents \u00b7respect for authority \u00b7how they wish to be addressed (e.g., Mr or Mrs vs. rst names) \u00b7comfort about sharing personal information \u00b7behaviour toward the opposite sex \u00b7mistrust of other cultural groups \u00b7values and beliefs related to dying. It's helpful to learn about some of the customs, beliefs and values of the different ethnocultural groups of older adults you work with.For example, if you learn a few phrases in an older adult's language,he or she may feel more comfortable. When possible, ask theolder person to tell you about differences between his or herculture and yours, or ask the older person's family or others inthe same ethnocultural group. 9The Nature of AgingSexual diversity Sexuality and sexual orientation remain important parts of who people are as they age. Older people who are gay or lesbian, forexample, may have faced discrimination in their lives due totheir sexual orientation. They may have been rejected by theirfamily of origin, and may have created their own \"chosen family\"that is different from a conventional family . As a result, the personmay nd it difcult to feel open about his or her partner or family .By showing respect and acceptance of an older person's sexualorientation, you show respect for the person. Respecting your diversity Ideally , you and the older adults you work with accept andrespect each other's differences. However, you may meet olderadults who do not respect your differences, and who may evenexpress racism, ageism or sexism toward you. If this happens,remember that some older adults have not had much contact withthe wider world. As a result, they may be more wary or judgmentalof people who are different from themselves. By showing an interestin the older adult as a person, you may help him or her to seeyou in the same way . Chapter 3, \"Communication Tools andTechniques,\" starting on page 37, gives tips to help you deal withsituations where you feel you are not treated as you would liketo be treated. 10Responding to Older Adults112 Substance Use, Mental Health and Gambling Problems in Older Adults Substance use, mental health and gambling problems inolder adults can have a variety of causes, including: \u00b7problems in a person's life situation (e.g., stress, poverty ,or poor nutrition or housing) \u00b7emotional problems (e.g., abuse or grief) \u00b7physical problems (e.g., stroke or other illness). An older person may have struggled with an addiction or mental health challenge for many years, or thechallenge may have begun more recently . This chapter describes substance use, mental health andThe Nature of Aginggambling problems and how they affect older adults. It looks at the causes and signs of these problems. It also offers tips to helpyou talk with the older person and to know when and where toget help. As you read this chapter, remember that mental health and addiction problems can range from mild to severe. Even a mildproblem can affect an older person's quality of life. Having one problem can also lead to others. For example, someone with depression may use alcohol as a way to help cope with thedepression. Often these problems overlap and are linked. You maynot be able to tell what is causing a problem, but this chapter will help you better understand the possible causes and how to respond. Alcohol problems Many adults drink alcohol without problems. When problems do develop, they may begin at a young age or later in life, suchas when a person has difculty coping with retirement or thedeath of a loved one. Older people can become isolated as theytry to hide their drinking from others, or as family and friendschoose to stay away from them. Effects of alcohol on older adults As people age, they become more sensitive to the effects of alcohol,and their bodies process alcohol more slowly . This means thatolder adults are more vulnerable to the negative effects of alcohol.For example: \u00b7Alcohol reduces muscle control, increasing the risk of injuriesdue to falls. 12Responding to Older Adults\u00b7Alcohol can make some health issues worse, such as confusion and memory loss, liver damage, diabetes, heart or blood pressureproblems and stomach problems. Some older adults may be alcohol dependent (also called addicted ). They may feel they cannot stop drinking, even when alcoholcauses problems with their health, nances, housing and socialor family life. If people who are alcohol dependent suddenlystop drinking, they may experience withdrawal . Withdrawal can make them seriously ill, and can be life-threatening in some cases. What can you do? While you may not be able to help a person reduce or stopdrinking, you canhelp to reduce the harm caused by drinking. You can also help the older person become better prepared toreduce or stop drinking. One way to help is to work with your supervisor to develop a care plan. This plan makes sure the person has food to eat andthe rent paid before money is spent at the liquor store. This willhelp to stabilize older adults with alcohol problems. It will alsohelp them form a connection with you. If an older adult asks you to buy alcohol and bring it to him or her, check with your supervisor to see if this is permitted. Yoursupervisor may feel it is safer to supply alcohol than for the olderadult to go out or get help from someone who may take advantageof him or her. How common are alcohol problems in older adults? Six to 10 per cent of older adults have alcohol problems, whichis the same rate as other adult groups (Seeking Solutions, 2004).Substance Use, Mental Health and Gambling Problems in Older Adults 13Signs of alcohol problems Warning signs of problems include: \u00b7loss of co-ordination, falls \u00b7slurred speech \u00b7problems sleeping \u00b7poor personal care, such as not bathing, not eating (or not eating well) or not taking care of health problems \u00b7empty bottles or cans in the garbage \u00b7irritability , depression or confusion \u00b7making excuses or making up stories to cover up the truth abouttheir drinking \u00b7memory trouble after having a drink \u00b7losing touch with friends or family . How to talk with an older adult who has an alcohol problem People with alcohol problems often have a low opinion of them-selves. They may feel they cannot give up drinking, or that noone cares about them. You can't stop people from drinking, but you can help them to feel better about themselves. By treating them with respect, youcan help them to nd the self-respect and strength they need todeal with their alcohol problems. If you confront the person about his or her problem alcohol use (e.g., \"You've got a problem\" or \"You should stop drink ing\") the person will likely deny having a problem, and will refuse totalk about it. When talking with older people with alcoholproblems, put \"the person\" before \"the problem.\" Try like \"alcoholic\" or \"addict.\" 14Responding to Older AdultsSubstance Use, Mental Health and Gambling Problems in Older Adults \u00b7Encourage the person to talk about his or her drinking when the person is sober (e.g., \"What did you do last night?\" \"How areyou feeling this morning?\"). \u00b7Describe noticed you've been havingdifculty walking.\" \"As far as I can tell, you've eaten only buttertarts this week. Is there a problem with your meals?\"). \u00b7Avoid saying that the person's problems will go away if he or shestops drinking. Instead, try saying, \"You don't seem to be yourold self these days; you haven't been going out as much, andyou don't eat as much either. How are you feeling? Would yoube interested in having someone to talk to about it?\" \u00b7Encourage the person to attend activities that he or she enjoysthat do not involve drinking. When to get help It's hard to know what you can or should do to help older adultswho have drinking problems. One thing you can do is let yoursupervisor know the signs that tell you the person's drinking iscausing problems. Your supervisor can then try to connect theolder adult with an alcohol-treatment professional. Older people who get professional help for their drinking problems are often able to cut down or quit drinking, and stick to thesechanges, even better than younger adults. However, some olderadults may not be willing to accept treatment. In addition, some-times treatment geared to older adults may not be available inyour community . If an older adult (or anyone else in the older adult's home) is drinking or intoxicated when you visit, your agency may requirethat you leave and contact your supervisor. If this is your agency's 15policy , let the older adult know this is why you cannot provide care at this time. Even when it seems there is little hope of improvement in an olderadult's drinking problem, you can help\u2014with the same level of care,patience and support you give to other older adults in your work. Anxiety It's normal and healthy to feel worried or afraid in certain situa-tions. If, for example, you were about to have major surgery , youmight expect to feel worried. Or if you were out walking and asnarling dog came running toward you, the fear you felt couldhelp you run to save your life. These feelings can be describedas anxiety , but they are not a concern. But some people feel anxiety often or all the time. It can affect their ability to carry out daily tasks and to take part in social lifeand relationships. This type of anxiety is a concern. Anxiety problems may be related to: \u00b7stressful or traumatic events \u00b7alcohol, medications or caffeine \u00b7family history of anxiety disorders \u00b7other medical or psychiatric problems. Kinds of anxiety problems There are different kinds of anxiety problems. These include: \u00b7phobias : when people fear a specific thing, such as heights or spiders \u00b7panic disorder : when people have episodes of extreme fear, often with physical symptoms resembling a heart attack 16Responding to Older Adults\u00b7obsessive-compulsive disorder : when people see danger in everyday things, and perform time-consuming rituals to make things seemmore safe \u00b7generalized anxiety disorder : when people worry excessively over a long period of time \u00b7posttraumatic stress disorder : when people relive the fear experienced during a traumatic event, such as an assault or accident. How common are anxiety problems in older adults? Anxiety problems are as common in older people as they are inyounger people. Research shows that: \u00b7Up to one in four adults has an anxiety disorder sometime intheir lifetime. \u00b7Almost 20 per cent of people over age 65 have had an anxietydisorder in the past six months; the most common form of anxietyis phobia (Blazer et al., 1991). \u00b7Anxiety disorders are the most common mental health problemsin women; in men, they are second only to substance use disorders(Rector et al., 2005). Signs of anxiety problems Anxiety problems can make people so worried and fearful thatthey behave in ways they know don't make sense. Anxiety mayalso make them feel physically ill. Signs that an older adult mayhave an anxiety problem include: \u00b7irrational and excessive worry or fear \u00b7checking and rechecking for safety \u00b7hoarding, collecting \u00b7refusing to do routine activities or being overly preoccupiedwith routine 17Substance Use, Mental Health and Gambling Problems in Older Adults\u00b7avoiding social situations \u00b7racing heart \u00b7shallow breathing, trembling, nausea, sweating \u00b7muscle tension, feeling weak and shaky \u00b7depression. Medications for anxiety problems People with anxiety problems are often prescribed medications called benzodiazepines (e.g., Ativan, Xanax, Halcion and Valium). These medications have a calming and relaxing effect thathelps to relieve anxiety . But they can also cause memory loss,confusion and loss of balance, increasing the risk of falls. Whentaken regularly for a long time, benzodiazepines can be addictive.Long-term regular use of these drugs should be stopped gradually ,and only under medical supervision. How to talk with an older adult who has an anxiety problem People with anxiety problems often know that they are too fearful,but cannot control it. If you work with older adults who appearto be overly anxious: \u00b7Use a calm and reassuring tone of voice. \u00b7Acknowledge their fears but don't play along with them (e.g., \"Iunderstand that going to the mall upsets you, but can you comeout with me for a short walk? You can let me know when youneed to come home and I'll bring you back.\"). \u00b7Be supportive without supporting their anxiety (e.g., \"I knowyou like to keep your bathroom spotless, and so I do an extra-special job. If you tell me what more you'd like me to do, I'll tryto make time on my next visit.\"). \u00b7Encourage them to engage in social activities (e.g., \"Did you 18Responding to Older Adultsknow there's a knitting group meeting at the seniors' centre tomorrow? I see you're always working on a project. Would yoube interested in going?\"). When to get help Anxiety problems can make it hard, if not impossible, to enjoy life.Fortunately , most anxiety problems can be managed by psycho-therapy , medication and relaxation techniques. Let your supervisorknow if you think an anxiety problem is interfering with an olderperson's life. Your supervisor can then try to connect the olderadult with someone who is qualied to help with anxiety problems. Dementia People sometimes nd it harder to remember certain things asthey age, but this is not dementia. Dementia is a brain conditionthat affects memory and thinking. Its effects depend on its cause,the parts of the brain affected, and the severity or stage of the illness. Dementia makes it harder for people to perform daily tasks, to socialize and to deal with change and uncertainty . It can alsocause changes in a person's mood or behaviour. Kinds of dementia Different forms of dementia include: \u00b7Alzheimer disease (affects 66 per cent of people with dementia) \u00b7vascular dementia caused by stroke (the second most common form) \u00b7Lewy body dementia (affects 15 to 20 per cent of people withdementia) 19Substance Use, Mental Health and Gambling Problems in Older Adults\u00b7frontal lobe dementia (affects two to ve per cent of people with dementia) \u00b7alcohol-related dementia. Care for people with dementia Treatments for dementia usually cannot stop or reverse the changesto the brain. They can, however, sometimes slow its progress or treat certain symptoms. One exception is alcohol-relateddementia, which may lessen or reverse if drinking is reduced. People with dementia are just as likely to live at home on their own or with family as they are to live in residential care (CanadianStudy of Health and Aging, 1994). They do better when they areable to: \u00b7take care of themselves as much as possible for as long as possible \u00b7stay in the same living situation \u00b7be in contact with the same people \u00b7follow the same routines as much as possible. When certain daily tasks\u2014such as shopping, cooking, bathing or housework\u2014become too difcult, workers and volunteers can helppeople with dementia remain at home longer. In the later stages ofthe disease, many people need to enter long-term care homes. Offering choices Whether older adults live at home or in long-term care, theyneed to have a sense of independence and free will. Even ifthey become less able to take care of themselves, they may stillwish to choose what to eat or wear, or what activities they do.Allowing choices can help to maintain their dignity in the face of a difcult disease. 20Responding to Older AdultsWhen offering choices, remember that some people with dementia have difficulty making decisions\u2014so being pressed to choosecould cause them anxiety and stress. If the person seems to beunable to choose, limit the choices offered, or help him or her to make the choice. You could say , for example, \"The chicken isvery good today; I like it,\" or \"This looks goodon you; let's try this one on.\" Delirium versus dementia Delirium sometimes looks like dementia, but is very different. Dementia usually develops over a long time, often over manyyears. Delirium is a severe confusion that comes on quickly andis temporary . Delirium can be life-threatening and requiresimmediate medical attention. Warning signs of delirium include sudden changes in a person's thinking and behaviour, or changes that seem to come and go overa day . Possible causes of delirium include illness, head injury , lackof fluids, or a reaction to alcohol or certain medications, s uch as anesthetics used during surgery . How common is dementia in older adults? People are more likely to develop dementia as they age.Dementia is found in: \u00b7two per cent of Canadians 65 to 74 years of age \u00b711 per cent of Canadians 75 to 84 years of age \u00b735 per cent of Canadians 85 years and over (Canadian Study of Health and Aging, 1994). 21Substance Use, Mental Health and Gambling Problems in Older AdultsSigns of dementia It's common to forget a name or miss an appointment and then to remember it later. When people have dementia, they don't rememberlater. They may ask you a question, listen carefully to your answer,and then ask the same question again. Dementia develops at different rates in different people. People withdementia are likely to have at least a few of the following signs: \u00b7forgetting appointments, misplacing belongings \u00b7difculty nding words, recognizing objects, performing familiartasks \u00b7repeating words or phrases \u00b7losing their way in familiar places, not knowing what time or day it is \u00b7behaving in inappropriate ways, using poor judgment \u00b7changes in mood, such as quickly shifting from laughter to tearsto shouting \u00b7changes in personality , such as becoming irritable, suspiciousor fearful \u00b7constant demands for attention and reassurance \u00b7difculty making plans and solving problems \u00b7loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities \u00b7loss of interest in being with others \u00b7depression. How to talk with an older adult who has dementia It may be hard for people with dementia to nd the right wordsto say what they want to say and to understand what you aresaying to them. But people with dementia need to express them-selves and interact with others as much as anyone else. Theymay become frustrated. Your patience and understanding cansometimes help to ease their frustration. 22Responding to Older AdultsWhen speaking to people with dementia: \u00b7Use a normal, calm tone of voice; convey warmth, understanding and respect; avoid using baby talk and terms like \"dearie.\" \u00b7Ask simple yes or no questions (e.g., \"Are you hungry?\" or \"W ould you like to have something to eat?\"). If you need more preciseinformation, ask others, such as family members, to ll you in.Try not to overwhelm people with dementia by asking questionsthey can't answer. \u00b7Be patient and give them time to answer. \u00b7Focus on their strengths and abilities (e.g., \"I see you got someexercise\u2014it's fantastic that you take such good care of yourself.\"). \u00b7Always explain what you are about to do for the person (e.g., \"I'mhere to help you get dressed. First I'll help with the buttons onyour pyjamas.\"). \u00b7Help them to stay oriented in terms of time, date and place (e.g.,\"Today is T uesday .\"). Never ask them to tell you the time, date orplace; they likely won't be able to, and so will feel they have failed. \u00b7Help them to reminisce; ask to see a photo album or to hear astory about their childhood or career. Even if you have heard thestories before, it gives them pleasure to tell you again, and helpsto build a good relationship. \u00b7If they tell you something that you know is not true, don't argue(e.g., if the person says her mother is coming, but you know hermother is dead, say \"Tell me about your mother.\"). \u00b7If they are focused on something they cannot have at that moment,introduce another topic from what you know about the person(e.g., \"I saw your granddaughter visiting with you earlier today .\"). \u00b7If you need to speak with someone about the person withdementia while the person is there, remember that the personcan hear you, and may understand what you say . 23Substance Use, Mental Health and Gambling Problems in Older AdultsHow to deal with behaviour changes AGGRESSION People with dementia may become aggressive when they feel fearful, powerless or threatened. Check with your agency forguidelines on how you should deal with aggressive behaviour. When working with people who are known to be aggressive: \u00b7Ask the family or other workers if the person's aggression is triggered by certain situations (e.g., being told to do things orbeing bathed). \u00b7When possible, create a soothing and safe environment where theperson feels a sense of control and is not crowded or botheredby noise. Ask if certain types of music may help to soothe theperson. \u00b7If the person does become aggressive, remain calm and leave theroom. Do not try to reason or argue. Wait a few minutes andthen come back in. Greet the person with a smile to help refocusthe person's attention. \u00b7Most important, keep safe. Report any episodes of aggression toyour supervisor. REDUCED INHIBITIONS Dementia can affect people's judgment and reduce their inhibition.Although rare, this can sometimes result in awkward sexualbehaviours, such as undressing in public, making sexual gestures,or inappropriate touching or language. Again, check with youragency for guidelines to deal with this behaviour. Remember that this behaviour is caused by the disease. Try not to over-react. Gently discourage the activity by redirecting theperson's attention. For example, if an older man is rubbing his 24Responding to Older Adultsgenitals, try to get him to do something else with his hands, such as playing catch with a large ball or balloon, or looking at aphoto album. Another option is to bring the person to a privateplace. If you've been told in advance that this person may actthis way , plan ahead for ways to redirect his or her attention. COMMUNICATION PROBLEMS As dementia progresses, it becomes harder for people to commu-nicate. You can help them do the best they can by recogn izing and accepting their limitations. \u00b7In the early stages : People with dementia are likely to be aware of their difculty nding words. Help the person communicate byoffering words or gentle reminders. \u00b7In the later stages : People with dementia may become less aware of their difculty , but increasingly frustrated and agitated. Helpthem to nd words only when necessary . Do not correct or insist.Use pictures or objects to help them remember. \u00b7In the last stages : People with dementia may be unable to com- municate with words, but they may still be able to understandwhat you say . They may also enjoy non-verbal communication.When speaking, use gestures, facial expressions and tone ofvoice to help make a connection. When to get help If you believe the person needs a higher level of care fordementia, tell your supervisor. Give examples of how you have seen the person change. Someone may need to visit to re-assess the situation. 25Substance Use, Mental Health and Gambling Problems in Older AdultsDepression Depression is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain. It affects thoughts, feelings, behaviour and physical health. It causesgreat suffering for people who are depressed and for the people who care about them. People may be depressed when they have a sad, despairing mood that lasts for more than two weeks. Depression is not the sameas sadness, though it can be triggered by sadness caused by loss,stress or major life change. Depression may also develop for noobvious reason. People who are depressed cannot just \"get over it.\" Depression in older adults People can have episodes of depression throughout their lives, or they may have their rst episode late in life. Depression canaffect anyone at any age. However, depression in older adults is often unrecognized because some signs of depression can bemistaken for signs of aging. Older people who are depressedrarely ask for help on their own. When left untreated, depressionmay continue for weeks, months or even years. Untreateddepression is the main cause of suicide in older adults. Depression may be related to: \u00b7medical conditions, such as chronic pain or illness, thyroid problems, stroke or Alzheimer disease \u00b7physical, emotional, nancial or sexual abuse, or neglect \u00b7side-effects of certain medications \u00b7alcohol use, which when used to relieve depression can createother problems or worsen depression \u00b7the death of a spouse or other family members or friends 26Responding to Older Adults\u00b7loss of intimacy and touch, isolation, loneliness \u00b7transition, as when moving from the family home \u00b7loss of independence \u00b7feeling less safe. Fortunately , antidepressant medications and counselling can help to lift depression. How common is depression in older adults? \u00b7As many as 20 per cent of older adults experience depression(Seeking Solutions, 2003). \u00b7Depression is more common among older people living in insti-tutions than among those living in the community . \u00b7Suicide is ve times more likely in people over 60 than in youngerage groups (Mood Disorders Association of Ontario, n.d.). Signs of depression People often think that depression in older adults is a normalresponse to aging (for example, \"It's no wonder he's depressed,he's 82,\" or \"If I had arthritis, I'd probably be depressed too.\")However, depression is nota normal part of aging. An older adult may be severely depressed if he or she: \u00b7does not get dressed or does not answer the phone or the door \u00b7loses interest in activities he or she used to enjoy , or spends more time alone than usual \u00b7feels hopeless, worthless and sad \u00b7has unusual outbursts of crying, agitation or anger, or showslittle emotion \u00b7talks less than usual or answers questions with as few wordsas possible 27Substance Use, Mental Health and Gambling Problems in Older Adults\u00b7calls, complains or demands frequently \u00b7does not sleep well or sleeps too much \u00b7eats more or less than usual \u00b7lacks energy \u00b7seems confused or has trouble remembering things \u00b7has trouble making decisions or following through with plans \u00b7talks about suicide. How to talk with an older adult who is depressed Older adults may not want to say they are depressed. They may think depression is a part of growing older. They may think theyshould just \"snap out of it.\" They may worry that others will thinkthey are weak or lazy . They may worry they will lose their inde-pendence because others will think they cannot cope on their own. It takes time for you to build trust with the older adult, and it takes courage for the older person to express his or her feeli ngs. When you are alone and can spare some time to talk: \u00b7Encourage the person to share his or her feelings by askingquestions (e.g., \"How have you been feeling?\" \"Is something onyour mind?\"). Give the person time to answer, and take time tolisten. Don't give examples of others you know with similar ormore difcult problems. \u00b7Show that you understand that times are hard, and that it canbe hard to talk about it. Be positive but truthful (e.g., \"It can't beeasy with everything that has happened lately .\") Don't try to makethe person's problems seem less serious than they are. \u00b7Try to give hope by pointing out the person's strengths or even thesmallest improvements in his or her situation (e.g., \"I see you're up and dressed, and so early in the morning.\"). Notice what has changed since your last visit; has the person smiled or called you by name? 28Responding to Older Adults\u00b7If an older adult talks with you about feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness and sadness, gently encourage him or her to seekhelp (e.g., \"It's worthwhile seeing a doctor about these feelings;there is help.\"). When to get help \u00b7If you think an older person in your care may be depressed, reportthis to your supervisor. Your supervisor can nd professional,qualied care for the person. \u00b7Take it seriously if older adults talk of planning suicide, even ifthey say it often. If a person talks of suicide, listen and talk quietlyand calmly . You could ask, \"How do you think you would commitsuicide? Do you have a plan?\" Talking with the person a bout his or her plans will not make it more likely he or she will commitsuicide. Report what you are told to your s upervisor. \u00b7Talking with someone about suicide may make you feel emotional and upset. If this happens, share your feelings with your s upervisor rather than with family and friends. You must always protect theprivacy and condentiality of the older people you work with. \u00b7If you are interested in feeling more prepared to discuss thisissue with older adults, you may wish to take the workshop ASIST: Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training. Check with the Canadian Mental Health Association to see if this workshopis available in your community . (See the Extra Resources sectionon page 42 for contact information.) Gambling problems Older adults have many opportunities to gamble, and often havemore free time for gambling than younger people. Casinos offer 29Substance Use, Mental Health and Gambling Problems in Older Adultsbuses to bring older adults from seniors' centres and retirement homes; charities offer bingo nights and raffles as older adults'social events. Older adults may see gambling as: \u00b7a way to get out and socialize \u00b7a chance to support a charity \u00b7an escape from problems, boredom or loneliness \u00b7a chance to win money . What is a gambling problem? Many older adults gamble, but most limit their spending to small amounts at the casino, racetrack or bingo hall, or on lotterytickets or card games. However, some do develop gamblingproblems, and may even lose their savings or home. Older adultsare usually retired and have limited finances; if they lose, it'shard for them to earn back their losses. Losing money isn't the only risk of gambling. It can also damage a person's physical health. Some older adults spend hours sitting atslot machines, instead of healthier activities. Some people may not think that playing the slots or buying lottery tickets is gambling. They may think that gambling is a problemonly when a person steals to gamble. And even when they havespent their savings on gambling, they may still not see the problem,thinking they will eventually hit the jackpot. Gambling by others\u2014for example, the person's spouse or children who may have borrowed and lost money\u2014may also result in problems. 30Responding to Older AdultsHow common are gambling problems in older adults? Problems with gambling are thought to be less common among older adults than in younger people. Current studies show that2.1 per cent of people aged 60 or older have gambling problems(compared to 4.8 per cent of all adults in Ontario; CAMH , 2005). However, because older adults tend to have less contact withfriends and family than younger adults, gambling-related problemsmay be less likely to be noticed in older adults. Signs of a gambling problem When gambling disrupts, damages or limits an older person'slife, it is a problem. Signs of problem gambling include: \u00b7spending more on gambling than intended \u00b7feeling bad, sad or guilty about gambling \u00b7not having enough money for food, rent or bills \u00b7being unable to account for blocks of time \u00b7experiencing social withdrawal \u00b7experiencing anxiety or depression. How to talk with an older adult who has a gambling problem Older adults may try to hide or deny a gambling problem. Theymay feel hopeless or ashamed about the situation, or they maybe unaware that help is available. If you think an older adult may have a gambling problem, asking a few questions may help to identify the problem. Encourage theperson to talk about his or her gambling, without asking whetherhe or she has a gambling problem. Don't confront or judge. Forexample, start by asking: \u00b7What do you do for fun? 31Substance Use, Mental Health and Gambling Problems in Older Adults\u00b7Do you ever play bingo or the lottery? \u00b7Do you ever go to the casino or the racetrack? If the person says that he or she does gamble regularly , and is willing to talk about it, ask: \u00b7What do you like about going to the casino (or playing the slots,playing bingo, playing the lottery , etc.)? \u00b7Is there anything you don't like about it? When to get help The way older adults answer these last questions may suggestthat they spend more than they feel they should, or that theywish they could stop but need to win rst. You can then mentionthat you've heard that gambling can cause problems for manypeople, and that some counsellors specialize in helping peoplewith gambling-related problems. If the older adult shows interest in learning more, tell your supervisor, who will try to connect the older adult with aqualified gambling counsellor. Medication issues Older adults take up to 40 per cent of all medications prescribed inCanada (Holloway , 2001). Most older adults take several types ofmedication at a time. Many older people take medications as prescribed. However, some forget to take their medications, or share medications withothers. Some may also \"self-medicate\"\u2014try to treat their medicalconditions on their own by taking more or less of a medication 32Responding to Older Adultsthan prescribed, or by taking medications not prescribed. Medications, even when taken as directed, can affect older adults in ways that weren't intended. For example: \u00b7side-effects \u00b7interactions \u00b7dependence and withdrawal \u00b7other problems. SIDE-EFFECTS Side-effects such as constipation, dry mouth or itchiness may beunpleasant. Med ications can also have dangerous \"adverse effects.\" For example, they can cause unsteadiness and confusion leadingto falls; delirium; or worsened depression leading to suicide.Reactions to drugs are often mistaken for signs of aging or of failing health. Older adults' bodies process drugs more slowly than younger people's. However, most medications are not tested on olderadults. Since medications may be stored longer in the older body ,they may have effects not seen in younger people. INTERACTIONS Taking more than one medication at a time can lead to medicationinteractions. When medications interact, they may not work aswell, or the interaction may cause other problems. Older adultsneed to tell their doctor or pharmacist about all medications theytake, whether prescribed, over-the-counter or herbal remedies. Older adults should not take medications with any amount of alcohol. Some medications don't work well if they are taken withalcohol, so the health problems the medications were taken for 33Substance Use, Mental Health and Gambling Problems in Older Adultswon't be treated properly . Other medications have an increased and dangerous effect when taken with alcohol, causing slurredspeech, sleepiness, stumbling and falls. Older adults who knowthis sometimes don't take their medications when they want todrink. However, missing a dose of a prescribed medication can also cause problems. DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL Medications prescribed for anxiety , sleep problems or pain canlead to drug dependence (also called addiction ) when used over a long time. When people are dependent on a drug, they feel they need the drug to be able to cope, even when taking it causes prob- lems. If they stop taking the drug, they may experience physical withdrawal . This can make them feel mildly to severely ill and anxious, depending on the drug and the level of dependence. Older adults who are dependent on a drug may: \u00b7become isolated as they try to hide their drug use \u00b7behave in ways that cause their friends and family to stay away \u00b7neglect personal care. OTHER PROBLEMS The common pain medications acetaminophen (T ylenol) and acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) can cause potentially fatal liver damagewhen taken in higher than recommended doses, and especiallywhen taken with alcohol. Long-term use of T ylenol containingcodeine may lead to drug dependence. Medications used to treat constipation or stomach upset, when taken too often or for too long, can also be harmful. Use of illicit drugs, such as marijuana, cocaine, heroin and 34Responding to Older Adultsmethamphetamine, is becoming more common as baby boomers age. Increase in the use of these drugs among older adults maycreate a whole new set of issues. How common are medication issues in older adults? \u00b7An estimated 50 per cent of prescriptions are not taken properly. \u00b7Up to 20 per cent of hospitalizations of people over 50 are dueto problems with medications (Coambs et al., 1995). \u00b7Over 150 medications commonly prescribed to older adults cancause problems if taken with alcohol (Seeking Solutions, 2004). Signs of medication issues The signs of medication issues are sometimes mistaken for signsof aging. These include: \u00b7slurred speech \u00b7increased confusion, lethargy or sleepiness \u00b7stumbling, falls \u00b7new medical symptoms following the start of a medication. How to talk with an older adult about medication issues You can help to identify medication use problems by askingquestions such as: \u00b7\"How do you keep track of all the medications you're using?\"\"Do you keep a list?\" \"Do you use a pill box?\" \u00b7\"Do you know what each medication is for?\" \u00b7\"I've heard that sometimes medications interact and don't work aswell, or can cause problems. Does your doctor or pharmacist knowabout everything you are taking, including herbal remedies?\" \u00b7\"Do you know if drinking alcohol affects your medication?\" 35Substance Use, Mental Health and Gambling Problems in Older AdultsWhen to get help Let your supervisor know if: \u00b7The older person seems unable to keep track of medications. \u00b7The older person uses more than one doctor to obtain a certain medication. \u00b7You notice changes in the older person's behaviour or healthfollowing the start of a new medication. \u00b7You think the older person may be misusing a medication bytaking it more or less often than indicated, or by sharing it withothers. \u00b7You think an older person's drinking may be causing problemswith his or her medication. 36Responding to Older Adults373 Communication Tools and Techniques All people need to be listened to and understood. You can makea difference in an older person's life by spending a fewmoments talking with the person. Ways to communicate When communicating with olderadults: \u00b7Don't use ageist language to indicate theage group.Substance Use, Mental Health and Gambling Problems in Older Adults\u00b7If you think the person may have trouble hearing or seeing you, ask, \"Can you hear me clearly?\" or \"Can you see me clearly?\" \u00b7Remember that 80 per cent of Canadians over 65 may haveproblems reading (Health Canada, 1999). Many older adultsprefer talking about something rather than reading about it. \u00b7Encourage older adults to talk about their own lives and experi-ences. When people tell their own stories, it helps them feel morecomfortable. It helps you learn about their challenges, strengths,culture, hobbies and interests, and the way they view the world.This information will help you connect with the older person. \u00b7Don't confront or argue with the older person. \u00b7You may spend only a short time with an older adult. You may beunable to get to know him or her well, or to understand all the per-son's care issues. When you see an older adult behaving in ways thatindicate a substance use or mental health problem, offer warmth andsupport, not advice, and report what you see to your supervisor. Listening To listen well, you need to: \u00b7want to hear what the other person is saying \u00b7want to be helpful \u00b7accept the other person's feelings \u00b7make eye contact \u00b7nod to show you hear, or respond with a few encouraging words \u00b7see the other person as unique, with his or her own experiencesand ways of expressing himself or herself. Talking about problems and giving information When talking with an older person who may have a substanceuse, mental health or gambling challenge, remember: 38Responding to Older AdultsCommunication Tools and Techniques \u00b7Some times are better to talk about problems than others. If the person is overwhelmed by other concerns, wait for a better time. \u00b7Some problems may have been going on for a long time. Theproblems may also be more complicated than they seem.Remember that they don't need to be solved right away , andyou don't need to solve them. \u00b7Anything you hear or see in your close personal contact witholder adults is private and condential. However, it is importantto tell your supervisor about any concerns you have about theperson's health. In addition, it is your responsibility to report anysigns that the person may be a danger to himself or herself or toothers, or that the per son may be a victim of elder abuse. \u00b7Before giving information to an older person about a problem, check with your supervisor to see if you are permitted to do this. If you are permitted, ask the older adult if he or she wouldlike this information (e.g., \"Would you like to know more abouthow alcohol and medications can interact and cause problems?\"). \u00b7Present information in a neutral, non-dramatic way (e.g., \"I'veheard that people who are depressed often keep it to themselves,which can make them feel even more depressed. I've also heardthat people who tell their doctor about how they are feeling, andask for treatment, are often able to overcome depression and toenjoy life.\"). Setting boundaries In your work, some older people may act in ways you findsurprising, demanding, annoying, upsetting or even frightening.Sometimes the best thing to do is put up with or ignore thisbehaviour. For example, if the older person you are caring forinsists on telling you the same stories over and over, and you 39nd it irritating, consider: \u00b7Does the person have dementia? \u00b7Is he or she lonely? \u00b7Does telling you those same stories over and over give that person pleasure? Sometimes changing how you think can reduce your irritation and help you to feel more generous toward the person. But what if the person's behaviour toward you is rude, offensive or threatening? For example, if the person yells, demands, touchesyou inappropriately or makes racist comments. At these times, youmay need to set boundaries to protect your time, dignity or safety . Even if you feel you can handle the situation, talk with your supervisor to get support and encouragement before doing any-thing on your own. By doing this, you also protect yourself incase the older person makes a complaint against you. Ask if yoursupervisor has information about the person's mental or physicalhealth that could help explain the behaviour. Discuss whether anychanges can be made to deal with these behaviours (e.g., anotherstaff person might be treated more favourably). If you know these behaviours are not caused by dementia or another mental health problem, you should not have to toleratethem. Using a calm tone of voice, be clear and direct. Let theperson know the impact of his or her behaviour. Say , for example,\"When you yell at me, I feel threatened. If you continue, I'll leave.\" Specify what behaviour you expect (e.g., \"When you speak to me in a calm and quiet tone of voice, I'll be happy to help you.\"). Berm, but gentle. If you still have problems, continue to problem-solve with your supervisor or other team members. 40Responding to Older AdultsSupport You may sometimes feel you cannot give older adults the help they need. Or you may see them behave in ways that seem toonly make things worse. This can be frustrating, and you mayfeel the situation is hopeless. Remember that you can only do so much. You must know the limits of your responsibilities andhow to get more help when you need it. Agencies may have different levels of support for workers and volunteers, but there is always someone to whom you can reportyour concerns. Your supervisor can then work to get you extrahelp, if needed. Co-workers may also have experience or knowledge that can help you nd a solution to a problem, or help you deal with it. You may also wish to get additional training or do extra reading to increase your knowledge.
